  "<p>Deep in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2012/may/12/borrowdale-cumbria\" title=\"\">Borrowdale</a> valley, where England is observed in its finest garments, there is ferment in the fields and on the hillsides. The gnarled farming communities who toil with their sheep on these lakeland slopes have prevailed in the face of Vikings, Normans and rampaging Scots for thousands of years and have learned to harness tempests. Now they believe they are in a mortal struggle with what they regard as a more implacable enemy: the <a href=\"https://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/\" title=\"\">National Trust</a>.</p> <p>The trust, guardian of England\u2019s natural treasures, is one of the biggest landlords in this part of the Lake District. Of the dozen or so farms scattered in these parts, only three are not owned by the NT. That number is now down to two, following <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/aug/31/teenage-farmer-national-trust-lake-district-land-george-purcell-thorneythwaite\" title=\"\">the trust\u2019s \u00a3950,000 purchase of the land around the historic Thorneythwaite farm</a>.</p> <p>Yet it is the trust\u2019s decision not to buy the adjoining farmhouse and outbuildings that has caused anger and distress in the valley. The buildings were sold separately to an unknown buyer and will, most likely, become another one of the holiday cottages which make up 60% of the homes here. Thus one of the most beautiful stretches of hill-farming land in England could soon be sacrificed to the National Trust\u2019s lofty vision of \u201cmanaging the wider landscape\u201d.</p> <p>It seems that the Lake District has been turned into a scarred landscape where the competing forces of land management, development and conservation are joining battle.</p> <p>After it was announced last year that 59 hectares of land, including the remote Stickle Tarn and a chunk of the Coniston Water shoreline, were <a href=\"http://www.lakedistrict.gov.uk/aboutus/news/news-pages/sale-of-lake-district-national-park-property2\" title=\"\">to be sold</a> off, there was uproar locally and at Westminster. In the House of Lords, <a href=\"http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld201415/ldhansrd/text/150305-0001.htm#st_50\" title=\"\">the Earl of Clancarty pleaded with the government</a> to stop the sale of \u201csome of the most beautiful land in Britain\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cStickle Tarn, Coniston Water, the River Derwent: are we really selling off public spaces, some of the most beautiful land in Britain, to fund the building of visitor centres?\u201d</p> <p>A debate about the very essence and nature of the Lake District National Park is also raging and the battle for Thorneythwaite farm encapsulates it. The farmers are seeking to preserve a way of life which has sustained them and their families for centuries. Others, though, feel that large parts of the Lake District have been shorn of their natural beauty by the persistent adherence to sheep farming and that there is an urgent need for the area\u2019s proper ecosystem to be restored.</p> <p>The trust stands accused of a strategy of rewilding the uplands of Borrowdale valley by stealth. It was accused of deploying \u201cmafia\u201d tactics in its purchase of the farmland by Melvyn Bragg, a native of Cumbria. In <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/aug/30/melvyn-bragg-accuses-national-trust-of-bullying-in-farm-row\" title=\"\">a letter to the <em>Times</em></a> last week he wrote: \u201cHad a billionaire bullied his way into this disgraceful purchase there would have been a deserved outcry. If the increasingly arrogant National Trust is there to protect anything of our past surely this is a prime example. The National Trust is about to destroy what centuries of working men and women have created. It used a shameful manoeuvre to achieve its aim. Who can check this bullying charity?\u201d</p> <p>The trust has said it has no plans for rewilding the site at the moment and that it would continue to be farmed.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6510966c60c1d1793f5b443461bf48e209a87b65\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6510966c60c1d1793f5b443461bf48e209a87b65/0_309_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A flock of Herdwick sheep on a road\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Local sheep flocks like these Herdwicks could face decline as farm buildings become holiday cottages.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Peter Edmondson, who works the adjoining Seathwaite farm, had raised what he had thought was enough money to buy Thorneythwaite, only to be outbid by the trust, whose offer was \u00a3200,000 above the guide price. The trust responded by claiming that it did not have the cash to buy both land and buildings and had thus offered the significantly higher price for the land for fear that the auctioneer might parcel land and buildings together to secure a higher overall price.</p> <p>Decades of working these hills have given Edmondson the figure of a spry, lightweight boxer in his prime and on Friday night his attitude was pugilistic when discussing the trust\u2019s conduct. Six generations of his family have farmed this land and he said that the fight to ensure that the traditions of hill farming and sheep farming at Thorneythwaite endure was not over yet.</p> <p>\u201cI had worked with the bank to raise the finance to purchase Thorneythwaite, but when we arrived at the auction we knew something was afoot.\u201d</p> <p>Whatever might have been \u201cafoot\u201d will soon form part of a wide-ranging complaint to the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/charity-commission\" title=\"\">Charity Commission</a> about the behaviour of the trust during the bid process.</p> <p>Edmondson said: \u201cThis body used \u00a3200,000 of public money to pay well over the market value for this land. And of course it threatens the sheep farming and hill farming tradition in the region that I would have preserved. If they were serious about maintaining the farming tradition they would have purchased the farm buildings too. I simply don\u2019t believe that this massive, state-funded institution couldn\u2019t have come up with the extra cash. Farmers in this valley would have been delighted if they had bought the whole package and signalled their commitment to hill-farming in this area.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve written to Dame Helen Ghosh, director general of the trust, offering a deal to allow me and others to farm the land properly and to take over the management of the 413 <a href=\"http://www.herdwick-sheep.com/\" title=\"\">Herdwick sheep</a> that belong to the farm. However, she hasn\u2019t deigned to write back personally. Instead, I\u2019ve had three different letters from three different trust employees, including a \u2018correspondence coordinator\u2019 effectively giving me less than two weeks to agree to an unsustainable, one-year tenancy skewed in favour of the trust.\u201d</p> <p>Edmondson intends to write to his local MP, Labour\u2019s <a href=\"http://suehayman.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Sue Hayman</a>, and also to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/tim-farron\" title=\"\">Tim Farron</a>, the Liberal Democrat leader whose constituency also takes in much of the Lake District. He is also exploring the possibility of a crowdfunding venture to raise the extra capital in the event that the Charity Commission blocks the trust\u2019s purchase.</p> <p>In the midst of all of this lies Thorneythwaite farm itself. As dusk began to cast a shadow down the valley, you could see why the handsome, cream-coloured farmhouse and its handful of stone outhouses would fetch a pretty price. From here you can see the valley stretching before you; its green floor honeycombed with quadrants bounded by impressive and immaculate dry-stone dykes.</p> <p>The hills above that the National Trust, perhaps, and others, are seeking to rewild stand gaunt in the diminishing light like the shoulders of a giant rugby pack. Perhaps they might look better with trees and ferns but there is also beauty in their austerity and in the way of life that the community below has preserved.</p> <p>In the end it may be that a screech of owls helps to decide the fate of Thorneythwaite farm. Any plans to convert the outbuildings into cottages may be undone if it comes to be known that they are also home to barn owls, a protected species under the <a href=\"http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1981/69\" title=\"\">Wildlife and Countryside Act of 1981</a>. Perhaps the new owner ought to find out quickly if his new purchase also comes with a feathered family of tenants whose home is guaranteed by the state.</p>",
  "<p>A British warship will arrive off the Libyan coast in the next few days in a dramatic attempt to intercept and arrest people smugglers as the flow of migrants trying to cross the Mediterranean for Italy reaches record levels.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/28/libyan-navy-admits-confrontation-charity-rescue-boat-msf\">Libyan navy admits confrontation with charity's rescue boat</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The unprecedented and risky intervention comes as Europe steps up its efforts to deal with the growing crisis, which has seen Libya become the primary route for migrants, following the closure of Greece\u2019s borders to refugees last spring. The smugglers last week sent record numbers of migrants to sea, with more than 13,000 people being picked up by charity rescue boats and the Italian coastguard.</p> <p>At least 100,000 men, women and children have crossed the sea to Italy from north Africa since the start of the year, leading to more than 3,100 deaths from drowning. But fewer than 100 traffickers have been arrested in international waters.</p> <p>HMS Diamond, a Type-45 destroyer equipped with a 4.5-inch gun, missiles and fast-firing cannon, will join an EU flotilla, Operation Sophia, tasked with catching smugglers at sea. Formal authorisation for the mission was given by Brussels in June. Last week the mission was widened to include intercepting weapons traffickers and training Libya\u2019s coastguard.</p> <p>But the plan to deploy HMS Diamond was met with scepticism by Crispin Blunt, head of parliament\u2019s powerful foreign affairs committee, who is due to grill British officials about Libya policy later this week.</p> <p>Blunt said that without Libyan cooperation naval forces could achieve only partial success, with the smugglers having impunity to operate inside coastal waters. \u201cThe smugglers are taking advantage of the fact there is no coherent government in Libya,\u201d Blunt told the <em>Observer.</em> \u201cUntil there is a political settlement in Libya that encourages a Libyan government to accept assistance in its territorial waters, I fail to see how this can be effective.\u201d</p> <p>His comments echoed a House of Lords report in May that questioned whether the operation could ever deliver its mandate to prevent people smuggling, with suggestions that the search and rescue operation actually increased the number of crossing attempts. Operation Sophia began last year and until now has concentrated on rescues and intelligence gathering. Its ships arrested 71 smuggler suspects who are now being dealt with by the Italian courts.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c27a9fab98dbba00babc85c24be544cd25abc5e1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c27a9fab98dbba00babc85c24be544cd25abc5e1/0_6_3639_2183/1000.jpg\" alt=\"HMS Diamond\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\"><br>HMS Diamond will join more than a dozen EU vessels.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Chris Ison/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The change to targeted interception has been delayed for months as Libya\u2019s new government refused permission for warships to enter its territorial waters, or to provide forces of its own to arrest smugglers on land. The new strategy carries a risk of armed confrontations in the Mediterranean \u2013 the Operation Sophia commander, Rear Admiral Enrico Credendino, warned in a leaked report earlier this year that interception missions meant that warships should operate in pairs: one to intercept, the other to return fire.</p> <p>HMS Diamond joins HMS Enterprise, which last week rescued 700 migrants off Libya, and more than a dozen EU vessels. Enterprise is a survey vessel which began working with GCHQ officers to identify networks in June 2015.</p> <p>Operation Sophia has used electronic eavesdropping over the past year to build up a picture of migrant smuggling, which is concentrated on the west Libyan coast either side of Tripoli. Mobile phone conversations between gang leaders are tracked, and the Italian-led force is able to identity \u201cblooms\u201d in conversations, indicating that smugglers are poised to send large numbers of migrants to sea.</p> <p>But in a cat-and-mouse game, the smugglers have changed tactics. After EU navies began seizing wooden smuggling boats, the smugglers have deployed rubber rafts imported from Europe and Turkey. The Operation Sophia report noted one consignment of 20 rubber boats, found in Malta, was allowed to go to Libya because Maltese customs had no powers to seize it. At sea, Credendino says that the smugglers now employ \u201cjackals\u201d \u2013 gang members in fishing boats acting as sentinels, tipping off the smuggling boats if they spot naval units in the vicinity.</p> <p>Libya\u2019s waters are already filling with foreign warships, with the American assault ship USS Wasp mounting airstrikes in support of Libyan forces battling Islamic State at its main base in the coastal town of Sirte. Libyan naval officials are suspicious of western operations in the Mediterranean, with coastguards involved in a confrontation with a M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res rescue vessel.</p>",
  "<p>Theresa May has insisted in her first major interview since taking office that there will be no snap general election before 2020. The prime minister told <em>The Andrew Marr Show</em> the country needed a period of stability after the shockwaves of the pro-Brexit vote, and that the UK should be prepared for \u201cdifficult times\u201d ahead, despite better-than-expected economic indicators.</p> <p>Pressed on whether she was tempted to call a snap election, with polls showing she could increase her majority of just 17 to 130 seats, May said: \u201cI\u2019m not going to be calling a snap election. I\u2019ve been very clear that I think we need that period of time, that stability, to be able to deal with the issues that the country is facing and have that election in 2020.\u201d</p> <p>Under the <a href=\"http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2011/14/contents/enacted\" title=\"\">Fixed-Term Parliaments Act 2011</a>, there is a statutory five-year gap between elections, unless two-thirds of the Commons agree, or there is a motion of no confidence in the government. Any other circumstances would require a change in the law.</p> <p>Discussing her plans for securing the best Brexit deal possible for the UK, the prime minister insisted controls on the movement of people from the EU to Britain needed to be imposed as part of a deal with Brussels. Brexit secretary David Davis will make a statement to the Commons this week on the government\u2019s emerging position on the terms of withdrawal and what kind of relationship the UK wants with the EU, May said.</p> <p>Her decision not to call an early election eases the immediate pressure on Labour, but leadership contender <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/owen-smith\" title=\"\">Owen Smith</a> has warned that his party faces a \u201cdecade of doom\u201d under successive Tory governments if Jeremy Corbyn is re-elected leader.

He says Saving Labour recruited 120,000 new anti-Corbyn members who have not been picked up by pollsters. \u201cThe reality is that this is too close to call,\u201d Race said.</p> <p>Smith\u2019s camp also claim their man can still win if they can convince enough people that Labour has no hope of winning under Corbyn. In his article, the former shadow minister for work and pensions paints Corbyn as irresponsible for surrounding himself only with \u201cpeople who agree with him\u201d and for \u201cdefining himself against his own party instead of the Tories\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cKnowingly marching off to electoral irrelevance is a gross betrayal of the people all Labour members and supporters \u2013 new and longstanding \u2013 came into politics to help,\u201d he writes. \u201cIf we give up on winning the next election, or falsely claim to be on course to win, we are willing accomplices for every Tory cut.\u201d</p> <p>on Monday, the Labour leadership will try to rally the disunited parliamentary party behind opposition to Conservative plans to cut corporation tax and capital gains tax when MPs return to the Commons from the summer break to debate the finance bill.</p> <p>Labour\u2019s opposition to the tax cuts will be led by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/26/labour-shadow-cabinet-resignations-jeremy-corbyn-who-has-gone\" title=\"\">the shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, Rebecca Long-Bailey, </a>who said that the debate was an opportunity for the party to stand four-square behind the leader.</p> <p>Long-Bailey said: \u201cThe government wants to reduce corporation tax to 17% by 2020. If we thought these cuts would benefit business and would increase investment, we would be fully behind them. But there is no evidence for that.\u201d</p> <p>She said Labour\u2019s emphasis was not on tax cutting but investment, adding that she was confident that if Corbyn won, the party would quickly reunite.</p> <p>\u201cIt is just a matter of time before everyone falls into line.

There\u2019s <em>The Little Book of Hygge</em> by Meik Wiking (subtitled \u201cThe Danish way to live well\u201d), out last week.

International interest, though, is very recent. \u201cIt\u2019s because we live such a stressful life, everybody is so busy,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s important when we have the moment that we can hygge. They forget to de-stress maybe in London. When I went to London it was all about alcohol and shopping!\u201d</p> <p>She starts me off with a <em>tebirke</em>, a pastry consisting almost exclusively of butter and sugar, coated with poppy seeds. Then she and Poul drive me from their cosy caf\u00e9 near the old harbour at Islands Brygge to the bigger branch in nearby Amager.</p> <p>\u201cHygge is when you treat yourself, it\u2019s not that healthy, but it\u2019s good food,\u201d Agnete says.</p> <p>\u201cWe are very proud of this word hygge,\u201d Poul adds. \u201cEverybody has a little laugh when you say hygge.\u201d</p> <p>This is strikingly true. Throughout the day, everyone I mention hygge to breaks into a broad smile. Danes talk about hygge the way Italians talk about food. This might be why in his book Wiking, the chief executive of the Happiness Research Institute in Copenhagen, proposes it as \u201cthe overlooked ingredient in the recipe for Danish happiness\u201d. It is, he writes, along with the social equality and life security born of the welfare model, the reason why Danes are ranked as the world\u2019s most contented people in surveys year after year.</p> <p>Places like Wulff &amp; Konstali and Bang &amp; Jensen have perfected the art of providing hygge-to-order for busy Copenhageners, making the city arguably the best place for foreigners to experience this particular brand of laidback informal homeliness.</p> <p>Otherwise, hygge largely happens behind closed doors, accessible only to foreigners lucky enough to know a patient and welcoming Dane.</p> <p>Hygge is perhaps most associated with hunkering down with cocoa and candlelight on a cold and rainy evening, but it can also be the gentle good time of a summer bicycle ride.</p> <p>Whatever it is, as I sit soaking in the sun in Amager, I am painfully conscious that I\u2019m not feeling it.</p> <p>The brunch, probably the most Instagrammed in the city, is wonderful \u2013 bacon, egg, porridge, fruit and other goodies all arranged in little ceramic bowls on a wooden plank. But my mind is racing about where to go next. I\u2019m not relaxing, and I\u2019m alone.</p> <p>According to Agnete, hygge is not an easy state to achieve, and difficult, if not impossible, to have by yourself. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of work behind hygge, you have to think about it, and you have to agree what\u2019s hygge for everybody,\u201d she says.</p> <p>It also benefits from familiarity. Bang &amp; Jensen is not hygge for Linnet simply because of the decor, but because he lives around the corner.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d99b86d03ca1257cbf616f676b401dfea2537a68\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d99b86d03ca1257cbf616f676b401dfea2537a68/0_43_6000_3600/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The mouth-watering brunch at Wulff & Konstali\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The mouth-watering brunch at Wulff &amp; Konstali</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Katrine Rostrup</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But even when hygge is established, it is easily destroyed. \u201cThe hygge can disappear just like that,\u201d Agnete says and clicks her fingers. \u201cWhen someone says something wrong, you can feel it, it makes a suction through your body.\u201d</p> <p>At her caf\u00e9s, for example, the younger waiting staff now have different music tastes from the owners. Even this tiny tension is a threat to the hygge.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s just so much easier if they share those preferences,\u201d Linnet agrees when I tell him this. \u201cPeople should stick to the common denominator of the group that they\u2019re with and not, for example, bring topics on to the table that can make it clear that they aren\u2019t as similar as they seem.\u201d</p> <p>It is rarely hygge to talk about politics, or indeed anything controversial. Hygge is linked etymologically to the word \u201chug\u201d. It has a sense of encirclement, of boundaries, of a safe space.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s a dark side that\u2019s easy to skim over in our desire to present hygge as our latest lifestyle fad,\u201d admits Thomsen Brits, whose mother is Danish and whose book, with its quotes from the Danish writer S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard, presents hygge as a philosophy of mindful living, of presence in the moment. \u201cI think that to create a kind of enclosing embrace or a cluster of warmth, there\u2019s always going to be the experience of sitting on the outside of that circle of warmth, there are definitely shadows on the periphery of hygge. There\u2019s an element of social control.\u201d</p> <p>Hygge\u2019s opposite, <em>uhyggelig</em>, does not mean \u201cuncomfortable\u201d as you might expect, but \u201cscary\u201d.</p> <p>When I go to King\u2019s Garden, the park surrounding Copenhagen\u2019s Rosenborg Castle, to see the picnics in the park that are a form of summer hygge, I meet two Danish teachers with a group of Iraqi schoolchildren.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9d80317376f1672813c5af33adb59e2f7ad8742c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9d80317376f1672813c5af33adb59e2f7ad8742c/0_258_3865_2318/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Hygge is not an easy state to achieve, and difficult, if not impossible, to have by yourself.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Hygge is not an easy state to achieve, and difficult, if not impossible, to have by yourself.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Getty Images/Maskot</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cIraqis don\u2019t have hygge,\u201d they maintain. \u201cThe other Iraqi teachers don\u2019t understand that you don\u2019t walk around during a meal, and the level of noise they make is not hygge.\u201d</p> <p>Linnet disagrees that immigrants and foreigners can\u2019t experience hygge. Having a pint or two, but no more, in a good English pub, he points out, is just about the most hygge thing you can do.</p> <p>But will this year\u2019s flurry of books teach the British to embrace hygge more fully? He doubts it.</p> <p>\u201cI think it\u2019s possible to market it and turn it into something which fascinates people, but I don\u2019t know if the consumers in the UK or in the US will feel that they\u2019re experiencing anything very unique,\u201d Linnet says.</p> <p>At its best, the craze for hygge could encourage a love of simplicity, a rejection of expensive brands and conspicuous consumption, a renewed focus on the social relations that really matter. At worst, it could boil down to a way of selling candles and Danish designer lighting.</p> <p>\u201cIf you get a list of things to put in your home to make it more hygge, I don\u2019t think it works,\u201d he says. \u201cYou can\u2019t just go out with your high salary and just buy hygge like a package that you can install. You need to spend time on it.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>When a barefoot <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/renee-zellweger\" title=\"\">Ren\u00e9e Zellweger</a> was photographed in 2005 on a Caribbean beach, marrying the country singer Kenny Chesney, reaction in Britain\u2019s popular media was straightforward.</p> <p>Chesney, said the <em>Mirror</em>, was \u201csaving\u201d the film star from \u201cbecoming a real-life Bridget Jones\u201d. It was just a flip line, but it deliberately missed the whole point not simply of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/helenfielding\" title=\"\">Helen Fielding</a>\u2019s resplendently resilient comic creation, but also of Zellweger\u2019s own wildly successful life, as she pursued her lucrative and acclaimed career in the Hollywood Hills. That point: she really did not need saving.</p> <p>Zellweger, who is Texas-born but has since been almost adopted by Britain after portraying Jones on screen with such gusto and with such a good English accent, has endlessly been compared with the hapless \u201csingleton\u201d she played in two hit films in 2001 and 2004.</p> <p>Even<em> Vogue</em>, commenting this summer on the swift annulment of her marriage to Chesney and also on her split, five years ago, from actor Bradley Cooper, judged: \u201cOne gets the sense that, like Bridget, Ren\u00e9e may have had her fair share of Saturday nights in front of the television. And it makes her all the more lovable.\u201d</p> <p>When an actor inhabits a part as well as Zellweger has, she cannot avoid being closely identified with it. Yet in truth, the only thing this fictional character seems to share with the woman who plays her is that public responses to both function like a monitor of our changing attitudes to lone women. The plots of the previous films, in which the gaffe-prone Bridget stumbles towards love and marriage with her ideal man, Mark Darcy (Colin Firth), have also been combed over for clues as to where modern heterosexual relationships may be heading.</p> <p>Now, 12 years later, Bridget and Ren\u00e9e are back, in a third film, <em>Bridget Jones\u2019s Baby,</em> released on 16 September, and the fate of this fictional heroine, born to a witty columnist in the<em> Independent</em> in the 1990s, is being weighed once again against the social values of our times.</p> <p>Fielding\u2019s Jones is lucky to be played by a performer as skilled and subtle as Zellweger, thinks <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/aug/16/beeban-kidron-sarah-solemani-strong-professional-friendship\" title=\"\">Beeban Kidron</a>, who directed the second film in the series, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2004/nov/14/features.review37\" title=\"\"><em>Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason</em></a>. \u201cRen\u00e9e is not only a great comedienne but also a heartbreakingly touching actress. Which is why she is able to channel Bridget with all the impossible contradictions that she holds \u2013 contradictions that women all over the world identify with.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0nhGGQ_PYyE\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/0nhGGQ_PYyE?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>Watch the trailer for Bridget Jones\u2019s Baby.</figcaption> </figure>   <p>Zellweger\u2019s real love life, rather like Jennifer Aniston\u2019s, is still repeatedly targeted for analysis. Perhaps because they are both famous for playing friendly, approachable women, their relationship histories are cheerfully decoded by strangers, despite the ample supply of alternative single/divorced celebrities in the film business.</p> <p>In any case, since it is central to the Jones narrative, Zellweger handles all personal inquiries gamely and honestly. \u201cI\u2019m not single, I\u2019m busy. That\u2019s my line,\u201d she was wont to reply when asked about her prospects of settling down. This summer, reportedly now happily dating an old Texan pal and musician, <a href=\"http://db2music.com/\" title=\"\">Doyle Bramhall II</a>, she opened up once again, admitting to wondering at the maths of her parents\u2019 long and happy union, in a way common to many other women of her generation.</p> <p>\u201cThey\u2019ve been married 52 years!\u201d she said. \u201cEven if I\u2019d have got married 10 years ago, it couldn\u2019t happen.\u201d</p> <p>Zellweger\u2019s return to the role of Jones will be her first screen appearance since 2010 and she clearly feels warmly about the character, gaining \u201ca few pounds\u201d to fill Jones\u2019s boots again. \u201cBridget is a perfectly normal weight and I\u2019ve never understood why it matters so much,\u201d she has said. \u201cNo male actor would get such scrutiny if he did the same thing for a role.\u201d</p> <p>Two years ago, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/oct/21/renee-zellweger-face-nothing-wrong\" title=\"\">Zellweger\u2019s face also came under intense scrutiny</a> when she emerged from a period away from the celebrity merry-go-round. A suggestion that she had let surgeons ease her passage into her late 40s was kicked about between columnists and commentators on both sides of the Atlantic, although Zellweger denied it.</p> <p>Film stars often endure this kind of invasive, intimate inspection because their faces are the tools of their craft, but it is a study that borders on the tasteless, as well as speaking of the collective western neurosis about the ageing process.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The charisma of this relatively unknown actress shone through the dubious sexual politics of Jerry Maguire's plot</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Born in the town of Katy in 1969, Zellweger was, she has said, an unadventurous child who had to wait until university in Austin to discover her love of performance. Her father, Emil, is Swiss and&#xa0;worked as an engineer in Britain for a while, living in Ealing, west London. Her mother, Kjellfrid, is from Norway, but she also spent time in England, working in Surrey as a governess and cook. The couple met on&#xa0;a ship sailing from Denmark to&#xa0;Norway. \u201cShe was with friends and he saw her going into dinner and asked her to have dinner with him. It was a shipboard romance,\u201d Zellweger has said.</p> <p>The teenage Zellweger loved music and she and her brother would listen to records by Abba or the Rolling Stones that their older cousins in Norway brought over for them. As her acting career burgeoned, so did her love of music and, as an example of cause and effect, she became close enough to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/jack-white\" title=\"\">Jack White</a>, lead singer of the White Stripes, to consider marriage. But independence was important to the young Zellweger, who has spoken of wanting to travel and \u201chave her eyes opened\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cI wanted to be consistently challenged and I knew I needed to be creative in some way,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Early walk-on screen roles, including one in <em>Dazed and Confused</em>, finally led to a big break when director Cameron Crowe cast the then 26-year-old opposite Tom Cruise in the 1996 hit <em>Jerry Maguire</em>.</p> <p>It is a film now known chiefly for two phrases still in popular use: Cruise\u2019s \u201cShow me the money!\u201d and Zellweger\u2019s sweet \u201cYou had me at \u2018hello\u2019\u201d. The charisma of this relatively unknown actress shone through the dubious sexual politics of the plot.</p> <p>Acclaimed roles followed in quick succession, playing opposite Jim Carrey in the quirky <em>Me, Myself &amp; Irene </em>(2000) and in <em>Nurse Betty</em> in the same year. She won a supporting role Oscar for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2003/dec/21/features.review27\" title=\"\"><em>Cold Mountain</em></a><em> </em>in 2003 and countless nominations and awards for <em>Chicago</em>. In Britain, she also won plaudits for her characterisation of Beatrix Potter in the 2006 biopic.</p> <p>Since then, she has tried writing and directing, but has also deliberately dipped out in order to live like a normal non-VIP.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t think that, as a creative person, you have that much to contribute when your life experiences are limited to those you have while you\u2019re emulating someone else,\u201d she explains.</p> <p>The third Jones film, co-written by Emma Thompson, Helen Fielding and Dan Mazer, has been mooted since 2009 and when it was finally time to get on set again in front of director Sharon Maguire, who made the original film, Zellweger prepared by spending time with the production crew on ITV\u2019s breakfast show, <em>Good Morning Britain</em>. Today\u2019s Bridget is supposed to be working in television news, although the actress said the stint with ITV also really helped restore her English accent.</p> <p>Last month, a reminder of the old nastiness about Zellweger\u2019s face reared&#xa0;its head in reactions to the release of the new film\u2019s trailer. A few male film critics who have mourned the passing of the actress they recognise have been royally flamed online by feminists, fans and assorted outraged defenders.</p> <p>Optimistically, we might hope that Zellweger has just had to shoulder the burden of being part of some sort of group consciousness shift. Perhaps wider society is having a final feeding frenzy, before slowly moving on, with a sense of shared retrospective guilt, from its obsession with the changing nature of a woman\u2019s face.</p> <p>As some actresses also begin to rebel against the pressure to field questions about their dresses on the red carpet and are even refusing to wear high heels at Cannes, maybe things are beginning to change.</p> <p><strong>Born</strong> Ren\u00e9e Kathleen Zellweger, 25 April 1969, in Katy, Texas, to Swiss father, Emil, and Norwegian mother, Kjellfrid.

Those of us campaigning for this want it to affect only those in regulated activities \u2013 we\u2019re talking about schools, hospitals, youth clubs, GP surgeries.

People need not just the freedom to tell what is going on, but a duty and to feel that they are protected if they do that.\u201d</p> <p>Kath Stipala, head of public affairs at the National Association of People Abused in Childhood, said the organisation was \u201cbroadly in favour\u201d of it. \u201cThe evidence we have seen from Ben Mathews comparing similar places with one another suggests we\u2019d get better reporting and that it saves money in the long term.

  "<p>One of the islands that makes up Papua New Guinea is called New Ireland. But it seems that a much colder island far to the north might also wish to be called New Ireland \u2013 the island formerly known as Great Britain.</p> <p>In the wake of the European commission\u2019s ruling that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/30/apple-pay-back-taxes-eu-ruling-ireland-state-aid\" title=\"\">Ireland must reclaim \u20ac13bn plus interest in taxes</a> from Apple, there is a good deal of excitement at the prospect of a post-Brexit Britain replacing its smaller neighbour in the affections of tax-shy global corporations. As the <em>Daily Telegraph</em> put it in an editorial: \u201cIf Ireland and the EU do not want a huge, wealth-creating firm doing business in their territory, Apple will be very welcome in the UK.\u201d Welcome, that is, to use the UK as it has previously used Ireland \u2013 as a compliant state that will look the other way while vast profits pass through, untaxed.</p> <p>It is, on the surface, an appealing prospect. You only have to walk around Dublin or Cork to see that Ireland\u2019s tax regime has been a honeypot for all the hottest digital corporations \u2013 not just the long-established ones like Apple, Microsoft and Intel but the entire new wave of internet behemoths: Google, Facebook, Twitter and so on. And the same is broadly true in other areas such as pharmaceuticals and medical devices. Little Ireland has a stock of US direct investment much larger than France and Germany combined. Ireland is the number one location worldwide for investment by US chemical and pharmaceutical companies and number two for IT companies. And no one thinks those corporations are attracted by the scenery.</p> <p>For the more excitable elements among the Brexiters, the EU\u2019s ruling on Apple\u2019s tax bill thus opens up a delirious prospect. The Brussels bureaucrats are moving against Ireland\u2019s vigorously pro-business taxation policies, but Britain, when it throws off the shackles of the EU, will be free to swoop in and grab the golden eggs from the Irish nest. Apple and Pfizer, Facebook and Google, driven by EU persecution from the emerald isle, will seek asylum in the New Ireland next door, where the writ of the Eurocrats does not run and the government knows how to treat a corporation with the respect it deserves. Could there be any more dramatic illustration of both the evils of the EU and the thrilling possibilities of Brexit?</p> <p>There are, however, two small questions about this strategy. Is it possible? And is it desirable? The answers might perhaps curb the enthusiasm of the true believers.</p> <p>There is, for a start, the small matter of whether, even after the EU tax ruling, Apple wants to leave Ireland for the UK or anywhere else. The answer could hardly be clearer \u2013 it doesn\u2019t.</p> <p>In an interview with Ireland\u2019s national broadcaster RTE, chief executive Tim Cook was full of indignation at the very idea that Apple might have benefited from illegal state aid in the form of a sweetheart tax deal. \u201cWhen you are accused of doing something that\u2019s so foreign to your values, it brings out an outrage in you, that\u2019s how we feel,\u201d he said. He made clear that Apple will appeal against the \u20ac13bn ruling and that it expected the Irish government to do the same. Those listening out for signs of a dismay that might be exploited by post-Brexit Britain will have been encouraged \u2013 up to a point.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"852c75573920644ac34890975c3e497c86169681\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/852c75573920644ac34890975c3e497c86169681/1394_0_2133_2667/800.jpg\" alt=\"Tim Cook, chief executive officer of Apple, has said that the company will keep investing in Ireland.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\"><br>Tim Cook, chief executive officer of Apple, has said that the company will keep investing in Ireland.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bloomberg/Getty</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>And the point at which the encouragement stopped was when Cook discussed Apple\u2019s intentions. What will Apple do in benighted EU-ridden Ireland? Keep investing. He reaffirmed without qualification that Apple was going ahead with a major expansion of its campus in Cork: \u201cWe\u2019re very committed to Ireland, have been for 37 years. We have a long-term romance together.\u201d</p> <p>So why on earth would Apple remain in Ireland instead of taking refuge in the brave new post-Brexit world of low-tax Britain? Partly because tax, even for greedy corporations, isn\u2019t everything. And partly because Apple is smart enough to know that the kind of outrageous dodge that resulted in a tax rate in 2014 for its Irish-based subsidiary of 0.005% is not sustainable \u2013 in Ireland, Britain or any other democratic society.</p> <p>Though market fundamentalists find it hard to believe, even global corporations need social relationships. Will they exploit every possible loophole to maximise their profits? Yes \u2013 ruthlessly and without conscience. But is the ability to dodge tax the sole criterion they apply to their decisions to invest? No. As Cook acknowledged: \u201cWe went into Ireland in 1980. We didn\u2019t go there to seek advantages on taxes \u2013 we had only 60 employees and very little revenue.\u201d</p> <p>This reassurance explains why public and political opinion in Ireland has been more ambivalent about the Apple ruling than the establishment consensus would suggest. The big right-of-centre parties, Fine Gael and Fianna F\u00e1il, have backed Apple to the hilt and tried to rally the public by warning that accepting the unpaid taxes would drive multinational investors away. But most people seem to understand that it\u2019s not so simple. The choice between colluding in morally obnoxious tax avoidance on the one hand and facing economic chaos on the other does not ring true.</p> <p>The Brexiters\u2019 fantasy of stealing Ireland\u2019s corporate investors relies on a deeply patronising attitude to Ireland. Underlying it is the notion that no foreign company would possibly invest in Ireland for any other reason than its lax attitude to taxation. But there are a lot of other reasons \u2013 a highly skilled and productive workforce, cultural vitality, political stability and (oddly enough) membership of the European Union with full access to the world\u2019s biggest single market. The obsession of giant corporations with avoiding tax does not blind them to their need for the social, political and cultural resources on which they draw.</p> <p>This is not just a matter of theory. A crucial point easily lost in the noise of the EU\u2019s Apple ruling is that the regime under which it could avoid so much tax has already changed. The notorious \u201cdouble Irish\u201d strategy used by Apple and other corporations to make themselves stateless for taxation purposes is being dismantled. Market fundamentalists would tell us that corporations will respond to this tightening of the tax regime by fleeing Ireland. Actually, they\u2019ve responded by paying more tax: Ireland took in \u20ac6.9bn in corporation tax last year compared with \u20ac4.6bn in 2014 when the abolition of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/14/ireland-abolish-double-irish-tax-scheme-apple\" title=\"\">\u201cdouble Irish\u201d</a> was announced.</p> <p>And why was the Irish corporate tax regime made tougher? Not because of the EU but because of an organisation the Brexiters seem not to have heard of: the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). It is the OECD, not the EU, that has driven attempts to clean up the worst excesses of corporate tax avoidance. (One way of seeing the severity of the Apple ruling is as an attempt by the EU to regain the initiative on an issue of such global consequence.)</p> <p>The UK is a member of the OECD and has signed up to these anti-tax avoidance strategies. Unless Britain wants to go completely rogue and leave the OECD as well as the EU, the fantasy of luring companies such as Apple with the virtual impunity from taxation they used to enjoy in Ireland could not be fulfilled.</p> <p>So much for the possibility of becoming the New Ireland \u2013 what about the desirability? Would it be good for Britain if it were to try to emulate Ireland\u2019s strategy of relying on foreign investment and attracting it by becoming, in effect, a tax haven for the largest corporations?</p> <p>The key point about Ireland\u2019s Faustian pact with global corporations is that it was a strategy of desperation. The country sold its soul in the 1960s because it had a stagnant agricultural economy. Indigenous industrial development was slow and weak, Ireland was an economic vassal of the UK and mass emigration was bleeding the country dry. Giving global corporations massive tax breaks wasn\u2019t an ideological principle \u2013 it was a last resort when pretty much everything else had failed.</p> <p>This matters in the British context because it explains why very low corporation taxes could operate in Ireland without creating social conflict. The corporate devil gave the Irish Faust a pretty good price for his soul: a way of moving from backwardness to modernity. But Britain has a radically different economic, social and political history. Transplanting a policy that worked for very specific reasons in Ireland into post-Brexit Britain would show scant regard for the nature of either country.</p> <p>Ireland has had to live with the consequences of its particular choice. One of them is what US economist Paul Krugman recently called <a href=\"https://twitter.com/paulkrugman/status/752841032870551552\" title=\"\">\u201cleprechaun economics\u201d</a>. Krugman coined the phrase in response to the news that the Irish economy <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jul/12/irish-economic-growth-revised-figures-foreign-investment-aircraft\" title=\"\">grew by an incredible 26.3%</a> in 2015. Literally incredible \u2013 the figures are massively inflated by the fiscal juggling of the giant corporations. Irish GDP is meaningless. There is a vast gulf between the real economy and the kind of hyped-up faux-economy you get when you turn your state into a conduit for torrents of funny money. And that hype is not harmless \u2013 the Celtic Tiger bubble was one of its more catastrophic products. It is not accidental that Ireland has the most unequal distribution of market income (before tax and welfare) in the developed world. In effect, there are two Irish economies: the foreign corporate economy that is highly skilled, ultra-globalised and very favourably treated by the state; and a weaker indigenous economy that exists in its shadow. One of the consequences of this extreme inequality of market income is that the state has to do an enormous amount of heavy lifting through the income tax and welfare systems to keep these divisions in check. This activist state is hardly what the British right expects it will get if it follows the Irish model.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"61f594b72659be00ad71b3e72c5822340fbf6c3c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/61f594b72659be00ad71b3e72c5822340fbf6c3c/0_47_4441_2664/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Steve Jobs, left, the co-founder of Apple, visiting the technology \u00adcompany\u2019s new factory in Hollyhill, County Cork in 1980\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Steve Jobs, left, the co-founder of Apple, visiting the technology \u00adcompany\u2019s new factory in Hollyhill, County Cork, in 1980.

And for those things they need big government funded by high taxes \u2013 on somebody&#xa0;else.</p> <p>It is pure delusion to think that the smartest corporations will be drawn to a Britain not only outside the single European market but no longer raising enough tax to invest in its society, services and infrastructure. Ireland is discovering that the game of beggar-my-neighbour tax policies is pretty much up. Inside or outside the EU, Britain will have to join Ireland and the rest of Europe in telling the corporations that, if they want to operate in civilised societies, they have to help pay for them.</p> <p><em>Fintan O\u2019Toole is a columnist with the Irish Times</em></p> <h2>FIAT <br></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"ec5ae999d94cf80ca7cc8440c0bfa94af7f303fd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ec5ae999d94cf80ca7cc8440c0bfa94af7f303fd/181_0_4499_2700/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Fiat.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>In 2015 the European commission ruled that the Italian carmaker\u2019s financing company had paid taxes on profits that had been underestimated.

  "<p>In a few days, conservationist Sacha Dench will take to the air in the most unusual company. She will launch herself from the tundra of Siberia in a motorised paraglider and, when airborne, she will follow the thousands of Bewick\u2019s swans that will have begun their annual migration from the Arctic to their wintering grounds in western&#xa0;Europe.</p> <p>The 4,600-mile trip will take several weeks to complete. Dench will either camp in the open or seek shelter with local people, including Nenets, nomadic reindeer hunters.</p> <p>Then she will return to Britain with information that she hopes will help to solve an ornithological mystery: the relentless decline in the number of Bewick\u2019s swans over the past 20 years. In 1995, there were around 29,000 Bewick\u2019s in Europe; by 2010, the figure had dropped to 18,100 and the numbers have continued to decline.</p> <p>\u201cThe problem is that we do not know why,\u201d Dench told the <em>Observer</em>. \u201cI hope to provide the answer.\u201d</p> <p>Several factors may be involved in the Bewick\u2019s decline, say experts. One is illegal shooting. More than a third of the Bewick\u2019s examined by staff of the Wildfowl and Wetlands Trust (WWT) have been found to have shotgun pellet wounds. They survived but thousands of others may have been killed by Russian and eastern European hunters as the birds have flown over their countries.</p> <p>\u201cHowever, there may be other factors,\u201d said Dench. \u201cThe disappearance of wetlands, which the swans like to land on; predation from other animals; the proliferation of power lines, which the swans strike in mid-flight; and climate change, which is altering the vegetation on which the swans depend \u2013 all of these may be involved. I hope to find out the&#xa0;culprits.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1a50e2f61943f0dcabe758180ab96e2afd6669a7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1a50e2f61943f0dcabe758180ab96e2afd6669a7/0_50_1200_1500/800.jpg\" alt=\"Sacha Dench in training in Devon and Cornwall for her Flight of the Swans, following Bewick\u2019s swans migrating from the Arctic\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sacha Dench in training in Devon and Cornwall for her Flight of the Swans, following Bewick\u2019s swans migrating from the Arctic</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ben Cherry/WWT</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The Bewick\u2019s swan is seen as a key species to study because the birds particularly interested Sir Peter Scott when he set up the WWT at Slimbridge in Gloucestershire after the second world war. Scott realised it was possible to identify individual animals from their bill markings.</p> <p>\u201cWe have named about 10,000 over the years,\u201d said Dench. \u201cWe know a lot about the lives and characters of Bewick\u2019s, so in that way they are very&#xa0;special.\u201d</p> <p>In 2012, as the numbers of Bewick\u2019s swans reached an alarmingly low level, an international action plan was agreed by countries that lie beneath the birds\u2019 migration path. Dench\u2019s expedition \u2013 known as the <a href=\"https://www.flightoftheswans.org/\" title=\"\">Flight of the Swans</a> \u2013 is the culmination of that effort.</p> <p>She will act as a \u201chuman swan\u201d, tracking Bewick\u2019s as they leave the Arctic, where they have been feeding over summer, and head west and south \u2013 through Finland, Poland and Germany \u2013 to their wintering grounds in Britain and other parts of western Europe.</p> <p>And she will do this in her motorised paraglider \u2013 a flimsy contraption consisting of a seat, a parasail, an engine and little else. Exposed to the Arctic elements, and travelling at around 35mph, Dench hopes she will be able to track Bewick\u2019s for about six weeks as they flee the bitter cold that settles over northern Europe in the autumn.</p> <p>Her flight, which has been backed by Dame Judi Dench (a distant relative), Sir Ranulph Fiennes and Sir David Attenborough, will be arduous, to say the least. Dench will have to spend many hours every day in her tiny craft, open to the elements, while relying on the hospitality of Nenets and other locals while on the ground. She will also have to sleep in the open on some occasions.</p> <p>Her flying skills will be critical to the mission\u2019s success. Yet the 41-year-old conservationists admits that she only took up paragliding a few years ago because she had developed a fear \u2013 of flying. \u201cI had been in a very small plane that got caught in a thunderstorm in Panama and we were thrown about in terrible turbulence. I decided I had to get my nerve back and so I took up paragliding.\u201d</p> <p>Dench has since amassed years of paragliding experience and has also been put through tundra survival courses, practised landing in water and rehearsed \u201call the things that could possibly go wrong\u201d with her craft.</p> <p>Dench will fly to Moscow on Sunday before heading to Siberia with the aim of beginning her voyage with the Bewick\u2019s on 15&#xa0;September. It is around this date that the swans respond to the increasingly cold temperatures in the Arctic and fly, in their thousands, to the west and south. She expects to complete her journey in late October.</p> <p>She will have one comfort, however. Dench\u2019s parents have both prepared playlists for her to listen to when aloft. \u201cMy mother has already given me her list,\u201d said Dench. \u201cIt is a very broad selection and has tracks from Edith Piaf and Jacques Brel to Tina Turner and Dire&#xa0;Straits.</p> <p>\u201cMy father has not yet sent me his, though to judge from the way he has been quietly chortling about it, I suspect there is going to be the odd dig about my flight. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if I end up listening to tracks like If You Want To Be a Bird or Ride a White Swan by T Rex as I am flying over the tundra.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Theresa May\u2019s closest advisers have ordered a clampdown on ministerial contacts with the media, in a move that has led to accusations of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/video/2016/jul/21/owen-jones-we-need-to-talk-about-theresa-may-video\" title=\"\">control freakery </a>at the heart of the new government.</p> <p>The orders, which ministers say effectively ban them from informal lunches or dinners with journalists, or interviews on television and radio unless approved well beforehand, have been handed down from No 10 to ministers via press chiefs and special advisers in every government department. Some ministers say they now feel so constrained that they cannot have off-the-record chats with trusted journalists or even text them with comments or private views, for fear they may be breaking the rules.</p> <p>One senior Tory said there was an unwelcome level of interference from Downing Street, with nervous press chiefs in some departments even telling ministers not to resort to \u201cfrivolous tweets\u201d or any unplanned or private contact with any element of the press.</p> <p>A ban on Twitter, used extensively by David Cameron in the later stages of his premiership, would be highly controversial.

One said: \u201cAny media bid now has to be approved, any quote has to be approved, even if it is with a local television or a radio station on a local issue. It is very frustrating and there is a lot of irritation. It means nothing can be done spontaneously even if it is on subjects that are entirely uncontroversial and show the minister and government in a good light.\u201d</p> <p>Another said that the policy would backfire as relations between the press and the government would break down. A senior minister said that it reflected No 10\u2019s nervousness in the early days of the May government, and was an attempt to make sure that very obvious differences between ministers over Brexit did not break too regularly into the open. Privately some TV and radio journalists say they have become frustrated by the lack of availability of ministers from the May government for interviews.</p> <p>Past prime ministers including Tony Blair and Gordon Brown tried to control contact between ministers and the press but with little success.

Starting with President Turbay, 1978-1982, followed by Presidents Betancur, Barco, Gaviria, Samper, Pastrana and including Uribe, all have in their different ways and degrees attempted peace accords with guerrillas, and sometimes with success, though not hitherto with Farc, which for long regarded peace talks as merely a tactic in their famous \u201ccombination of all forms of struggle\u201d.</p> <p>Not one of these presidents can be characterised as a hard-line right winger countenancing paramilitary death squads. Many army officers who did countenance them have been jailed. These governments have also had to fight Farc and the ELN, whose popular support has always been limited. That for a long time they did so ineffectually, with inadequate means, in part explains the rise of paramilitarism.</p> <p>Since the Pastrana government, 1998-2002, the US has provided effective military aid, which, to my mind, Colombia has every right to expect, and has supported the Havana peace talks consistently and discretely.

  "<p>If Pauline Hanson seemed isolated in her open views about race and identity in Canberra 20 years ago, this time she may find herself struggling for the bright white spotlight.

This week\u2019s shotgun wedding video starring Hanson and Tony Abbott aims to clear out the last vestiges of her decades-old dispute with the \u201ctraditional\u201d conservative right. </p> <p>Pauline Hanson\u2019s back in Canberra, and many there are keen to show us that the sky hasn\u2019t fallen in, although <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/05/what-you-need-to-know-about-one-nations-malcolm-roberts-and-sovereign-citizens\">Malcolm Roberts </a>may yet demand empirical evidence for such a galactic non-event.</p> <p>In the late 90s I made two songs from editing Hanson\u2019s voice, changed my name to Pauline Pantsdown and ran as a NSW Senate candidate in the 1998 election while my song \u201cI Don\u2019t Like It\u201d was topping the charts (the first song \u201cI\u2019m a Back Door Man\u201d having been temporarily halted after court action by Hanson). </p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SxFc37h6js\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"345\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/8SxFc37h6js?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>Pauline Pantsdown \u2013 I Don\u2019t Like It</figcaption> </figure>   <p>Contrary to popular discourse by and about Hanson as a \u201cnon-politician\u201d, I felt that she was the most constructed celebrity politician I\u2019d ever seen, with a rapidly-changing succession of handlers pushing an American-style log cabin story to present her as an \u201cordinary Australian\u201d. </p> <p>I could only see her \u201cordinariness\u201d in her presentation and vocal style, as opposed to her beliefs or politics. Her voice somewhat nostalgically reminded me of my mother\u2019s Queensland family, and when required to speak in character (as opposed to miming my edit of her voice), I\u2019d call on childhood memories of Aunt Jeanette. There hadn\u2019t been anyone who sounded like my aunt in parliament before, but Aunt Jeanette hadn\u2019t blamed the world\u2019s problems on Aboriginal and Asian people.</p> <p>At the time, I hoped to have an effect by mimicking her constructed media image, presenting as an \u201calternate Pauline\u201d to critique her politics. I met many Hanson supporters while on the campaign trail, and I\u2019d never met political fans who knew so little of their hero\u2019s policies. Some of them were racists, the rest were just looking for their Aunt Jeanette.</p> <p>Since Hanson\u2019s re-election two months ago, debate has swirled around how to \u201crespond\u201d to her.

  "<p>Jonathan Ford pulls up a chair at the Football Association of Wales headquarters in Cardiff and, with a smile, says that all talk of France has been banned. For Wales, it is about looking to the future rather than basking in the past, yet nobody wants to leave behind the memories of Euro 2016, including the chief executive. \u201cA week after the homecoming I took the family on a driving holiday \u2013 through France,\u201d says Ford, laughing.</p> <p>Ford has plenty to be happy about. The national association has never been in a better state of health on and off the pitch. Optimism abounds on the back of those wonderful results in the summer, the FAW\u2019s turnover has more than doubled and there is something special about the relationship between the Wales supporters and the national team, as well as the bond among the players. From a football perspective, it feels as though the nation has come together.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/02/wales-chris-gunter-world-cup-2018-qualifying-moldova\">Wales\u2019 Chris Gunter: We will give everything to replicate Euro 2016 run</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cThe factors that define the Welsh identity are driven by two key things, one of them is culture and the other is sport. That is a fundamental thing that we\u2019re able to tap into,\u201d Ford says. \u201cIt was brought to life in France by people like Gareth Bale \u2013 we didn\u2019t tell Gareth to say: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/jun/10/gareth-bale-wales-pride-england-slovakia-euro-2016-real-madrid\" title=\"\">\u2018We have more passion, we play with more pride than England,\u2019</a> but it tapped beautifully into what we\u2019re all about, from the dragon to <em>Gorau Chwarae Cyd Chwarae</em> [Team Play is the Best Play] on the badge. That was also a major shift within the player group mentality, to get them to galvanise people.</p> <p>\u201cThose players would run through walls for Wales. When they were leaving each other after France there were tears because they\u2019d been with each other for 46 days. You see the players arriving back into camp the other day and they were reporting too early because they can\u2019t wait to get with their mates.\u201d</p> <p>For Ford, it was vital that the man who has harnessed that spirit and camaraderie to such positive effect remained at the helm to oversee the World Cup qualifying campaign, which begins against Moldova in Cardiff . Chris Coleman has rebuilt his managerial reputation with Wales and the FAW <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/aug/02/hull-city-approach-chris-coleman-rejected-welsh-fa\" title=\"\">had no intention of granting Hull City permission to speak to the 46-year\u2011old</a> when the Premier League club approached them last month.</p> <p>\u201cChris\u2019s profile was fantastic before France and it was raised even more so after, so understandably people did come knocking,\u201d Ford says. \u201cWhen the call came [from Hull], I spoke with the president and with others, and at that time we were left with the only option available to us.</p> <p>\u201cIt would have caused us an awful lot of problems to lose the national team manager four weeks before the team\u2019s first match and that was something that we weren\u2019t prepared to entertain, so we expected the contract to be honoured and denied them the opportunity to engage, because saying: \u2018Yes, you can talk\u2019, means \u2018Yes, you can go.\u2019 And we weren\u2019t prepared to do that. Chris could still break a contract, but there are consequences to that.</p> <p>\u201cHull have started OK. But they\u2019ve got a lot of problems. They were struggling with the squad that they had \u2013 they\u2019ve brought a few players in now. My prediction would still be that they\u2019re odds-on favourites to be in the relegation zone \u2013 we\u2019ll see on that. But I think Chris could do better than Hull.\u201d</p> <p>As for Ford\u2019s own career, he is entitled to feel a sense of satisfaction when he reflects on how far the FAW have come since his appointment in December 2009. He was 39 at the time and joining an organisation that needed to be dragged into the 21st century. \u201cCredit to the FAW council, they knew that they needed someone who was going to shake the cage and modernise the association,\u201d says Ford, who had spent the best part of a decade working for Coca-Cola and came from a marketing background.</p> <p>\u201cThe strategic plan I inherited, which was the first the FAW had written, wasn\u2019t even written by my predecessor, or by the people within the organisation. He got his predecessor to write it. It was rubbish and it was collecting dust. And they did it because they were forced to do it by the Welsh government and Sport Wales. We fundamentally changed all that. Look at the organisation now \u2013 we\u2019re a much younger, dynamic, culturally different organisation to what we were previously.\u201d</p> <p>Ford acknowledges that it has not been an easy journey. \u201cThere are times, like when you have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2011/nov/27/gary-speed-death-shay-given\" title=\"\">a tragedy like Gary Speed</a> or, on a very different note, when you come away from Serbia with a scoreline like we did [<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2012/sep/11/wales-serbia-world-cup-qualifier-report\" title=\"\">Wales lost 6-1 in 2012</a>], when you think: \u2018Oh my God, am I going to make it?\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Step by step, though, everything has come together in what Ford describes as a purple patch for Welsh football. Reaching <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/jul/06/portugal-wales-euro-2016-match-report\" title=\"\">the semi-finals of Euro 2016 </a>surpassed all expectations and also vindicated Ford\u2019s decision to push the FAW council to invest every penny of the \u00a36.4m tournament participation fee before a ball had been kicked, to create an environment that gave the players the best chance of making things succeed in France.</p> <p>No stone will be left unturned in this campaign, yet Ford is not getting carried away and viewing qualification for the World Cup, from a group that includes Serbia, Austria and the Republic of Ireland, as straightforward. \u201cIn my mind we do need a good start. But we do need to be careful,\u201d he says. \u201cExpectations need to be managed in and around the camp. Just one Euro success, which was fantastic, cannot be taken as \u2018we should expect\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>Although Wales will play the first three qualification home matches at the Cardiff City Stadium, the venue for the Austria and Republic of Ireland fixtures has yet to be confirmed and raises the question of whether the FAW are considering taking those games to the much larger Principality Stadium, where they have not played since 2011.</p> <p>\u201cWe haven\u2019t made the decision yet,\u201d Ford says. \u201cWhat we will do is play a match where we think we can get the points. I suppose the question comes: \u2018What happens if you don\u2019t need the points at the end?\u2019 If we have already sailed through and qualified, which would be a dream come true, you\u2019d probably want to milk that last game against the Republic of Ireland and go there [to the Principality Stadium].</p> <p>\u201cYou could also turn it around the other way, so that if we\u2019ve got no chance of qualifying and the Republic of Ireland have, then you would take it to the Principality Stadium, which is not necessarily the right thing to do other than on a monetary basis. If we\u2019re both in contention, we\u2019ll take it to the stadium where we\u2019ve got most chance of winning and, atmospherically, that will probably be the Cardiff City Stadium.\u201d</p> <p>Whatever happens over the course of the next 12 months or so, Ford is determined that Wales keep pushing on. \u201cThere\u2019s no sitting back and resting on our laurels, saying France was fantastic,\u201d he says. \u201cWe cannot assume that because we were successful we\u2019ll be successful again \u2013 Chris and I are absolutely aligned on that. It\u2019s all about what more we can do to take it to the next level.\u201d</p>",

It depends on Edmund\u2019s nerve and energy and Djokovic\u2019s fitness. You would have to rate Edmund at least a 40-60 hope.

The physical signs for him were excellent because he wasn\u2019t fading at the end at all.</p> <p>\u201cIt was a big, big win for Kyle. John Isner is such a tough guy to play. For Kyle to manage the occasion and play his best tennis on the big points, that\u2019s a fantastic sign. The backhand pass he hit up the line when Isner was coming at him in the fourth set was magnificent. That last forehand as well \u2013 it was there to be hit, but to put it away as confidently as he did was still very impressive.</p> <p>\u201cDavis Cup has given them a platform. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/jul/17/davis-cup-great-britain-serbia-tennis\">Look at what Kyle achieved in Serbia</a> with that fantastic win over [Dusan] Lajovic.

That brings different pressures but I would much rather be in the situation I am in now than a few seasons ago when you wondered whether you would get paid or have a job the following week.</p> <p>\u201cThe first couple of years at Wasps were tough. We were fighting relegation as well after a load of retirements and injuries and had to play guys from the under-20s. We should have gone down (in 2012 when they finished one point above relegated Newcastle). That would have been it for the club because we did not have a buyer on the horizon and did not have any assets, no ground or training facilities. I believe keeping us up was my best achievement as a coach. Newcastle went down but they were a better team than us. We found a way of staying up and it was remarkable.\u201d</p> <p>Wasps then played at Adams Park, the home of Wycombe Wanderers. The only income they generated from the ground was on match days, and then nowhere near enough as they built up a debt in millions with no means to repay it. In 2014 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2014/dec/19/wasps-ricoh-arena-rugby-london-irish-27000-crowd\">they moved to Coventry</a>, quickly taking full control of the Ricoh Arena and gaining an asset that has allowed them to sign leading players from abroad: George Smith and Charles Piutau last season, Willie Le Roux and Kurtley Beale in this one, although their debuts will be delayed.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/sep/03/saracens-worcester-premiership-rugby-union-match-report\">Schalk Burger scores on Saracens debut in Twickenham win over Worcester</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cWhere we are now is completely different from a few years ago but we can only spend the same as everyone else. It does not matter how much money you have; you can only go to the level of the salary cap. We lost Charles Piutau and signed Willie Le Roux, which is where you want to be. What I want as a coach is two quality players in each position and the prospect of putting combinations together is mouthwatering when you consider the players we will have to choose from behind, with the likes of Le Roux, Beale, Danny Cipriani, Kyle Eastmond, Elliot Daly, Christian Wade, Frank Halai and Jimmy Gopperth in the squad.</p> <p>\u201cWe are a long way off getting things all together but players will be putting pressure on each other and I will be able to rotate the squad so that nobody plays too many games. It will be after Christmas when we see everyone firing and, while we have signed players of top quality from overseas, having a strong English contingent is important to me: I was delighted to recruit Kyle, even though he was not a planned signing. We had a few injury problems and, when he became available, we jumped in quickly.\u201d</p> <p>Exeter will present a high opening hurdle. The two sides met five times last season and Wasps\u2019 sole victory was at the Ricoh in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/apr/09/wasps-exeter-european-rugby-champions-cup-match-report\">European Champions Cup quarter-final</a>, and that was through a last-minute try.

We have not achieved that much in the last 10 years. We have to be like Leicester, Saracens and Northampton, always there and playing consistently at European rugby\u2019s top table. Of course we want to push for the top four and to win things, but if you offered me winning something this season and then being out of the top six for the next four or being in the top six for the next five, I would take the latter.</p> <p>\u201cWe learned a lot from the two semi-final defeats, to Exeter and Saracens in the Champions Cup. It was a couple of games too far with a number of players tired and I should have rested some along the way. We need to get used to playing in big games.

Whether the positivity is still intact after the closing ceremony on 18 September is hard to predict, especially as the reduction in transport links is one of the biggest concerns for national associations who are worried that it will not be easy for athletes to move around the city, but there are reasons to be hopeful that the event will not fall flat.</p> <p>In normal circumstances, representatives of the IPC would have arrived in Rio a few days ago.

The charity condemned the attack, saying: \u201cThis was a serious and worrying attack, with shooting towards our boat which could have put our staff in acute physical danger.\u201d</p> <p>It is not the first time Libya\u2019s navy has threatened rescue boats. In April, warning shots were fired prior to the boarding of a vessel from the German charity Sea Watch. \u201cThey fired shots in the air and entered our ship. They claimed to be looking for illegal fishing,\u201d says Sea Watch\u2019s Ruben Neugebauer.</p> <p>Rescue ships from nine aid groups operating off Libya are already at full stretch. A deal cut in the spring between the EU and Turkey has blocked the route to Europe used by 900,000 migrants last year. As a result, smuggling gangs have switched gear, channelling Middle Eastern migrants through Libya to join the growing number of Africans making the same journey. \u201cThe Turkey deal was done in March, it takes some time to change routes, but this is changing right now,\u201d says Neugebauer.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We don't want to pick people out of the water while a naval vessel is there with all guns blazing</p> <footer> <cite>Peter Sweetnam, MOAS</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>There is apprehension among the rescue crews about the coming armed intervention by combined EU navies, authorised last week by Brussels. Some fear they will be caught in the crossfire. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to pick people out of the water while a naval vessel is there with all guns blazing,\u201d says Peter Sweetnam, chief executive of Malta-based <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2014/jul/16/couple-launch-mediterranean-migrant-search-project\" title=\"\">Migrant Offshore Aid Station</a>.</p> <p>Speaking from the deck of his rescue ship, Phoenix, Sweetnam says charity boats are already working flat out, with smugglers sending people to sea in wooden hulks, inflatable rafts and anything that floats. \u201cWe\u2019ve got 414 survivors on board at the moment, and we helped rescue more than 1,000 in the past two days. After the MSF attack, we improved our communications; it\u2019s a reminder of the element we are working in,\u201d he says.</p> <p>The growth of the flotilla of rescue ships from charities across Europe has seen tens of thousands saved from drowning, but the August attack has put a question mark over how long unprotected vessels can continue operating. \u201cIf the security situation deteriorates further, I don\u2019t think the small NGOs can continue,\u201d says Cusumano. \u201cAs for the bigger boats, these boats are chartered. They belong to a ship owner; I can imagine the ship owners pulling out.\u201d</p> <p>For the crews of the rescue ships, the fear of kidnap sits alongside anxiety that Italy, recipient of 100,000 migrants so far this year, may refuse to take the people they rescue, since few other EU states are willing to take their share of new arrivals. North African states are equally unwilling to help, leaving the rescuers wondering if they will one day run out of ports willing to take saved migrants.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3225be420fd6e395284f2759b8079a2f06d4d866\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3225be420fd6e395284f2759b8079a2f06d4d866/0_82_3072_1843/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Charity worker and migrant child\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Italian Red Cross worker helps a migrant child after the MOAS charity rescued 304 people in one operation last month</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Yara Nardi / Italian Red Cross/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There is unease among charities about asking for protection from the growing number of foreign warships. NGOs fear their independence would be compromised by seeking naval protection, and that protection would require them to operate farther from the coast, leaving many migrant boats to founder.</p> <p>Yet there is no sign of an end to the human exodus. Libya\u2019s UN-backed government, unelected and lacking popular support, has no security force of its own or the means to police the militias, for whom migrant smuggling is big business.

The bigger problem highlighted by charity crews, many having worked off Libya for two years, is the lack of a political solution to the crisis, with European states unwilling to open their doors to legal mass migration.</p> <p>\u201cThis could all be solved if the EU could give migrants procedures,\u201d says Neugebauer. \u201cThis is a political problem, it\u2019s absolutely man-made.

Simply titled <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/jazz-festival-jim-marshall.html\"><em>Jazz Festival</em></a>, it is not just a collection of great, mostly unseen fly-on-the-wall portraits, but a document of what the veteran jazz writer <a href=\"http://www.jazzwax.com/2009/05/interview-nat-hentoff-part-1.html\">Nat Hentoff</a>, describes as \u201cone of the most important periods in the cultural history of the United States\u201d. From 1960 to 1966, Marshall photographed the performers and the audiences at the Monterey and Newport jazz and folk festivals, the precursors of the huge hippy gatherings of the late 60s \u2013 Woodstock, Isle of Wight, Glastonbury. His images attest to the surprisingly intimate and formal nature of these early events: everyone is dressed smartly in the preppie-meets-boho style of the time and the audience sits attentive in rows of seats as if attending a classical recital.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>His photographs often possess a sense of quiet power that only comes with proximity to your subject</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>More intriguingly, when Marshall\u2019s democratic camera captured the young, relaxed, supremely stylish and racially mixed audiences that the jazz giants were attracting, at least on the east and west coasts, he was chronicling a brief utopian moment amid the gathering storm of protest and often violent reprisal that would define the civil rights era of the early-to-mid 1960s. \u201cWhen Jim Marshall photographed integrated crowds peacefully digging each other\u2019s company at jazz festivals,\u201d writes Hentoff, \u201cnews photographs of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2010/mar/24/charles-moore-obituary-sean-ohagan\">police dogs attacking black men, women and children</a> captured a very different reality in the south.\u201d</p> <p>The integrated audiences at Newport and Monterey were, as Davis puts it, \u201cvery much the exception in America at that time. Jazz music was the catalyst for change in a very real way. It was universal. People came for the music, whatever their age, beliefs or skin colour. The music united people.\u201d</p> <p>For Hentoff, the early jazz festivals were an augury of what was to come. In 1963, he reported on the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/aug/24/march-on-washington-anniversary-martin-luther-king\">March on Washington</a> that culminated with a concert at the Lincoln Memorial, where <a href=\"http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/mahalia-jackson-the-queen-of-gospel-puts-her-stamp-on-the-march-on-washington\">Mahalia Jackson</a> sang and Rev Martin Luther King made his electrifying <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/aug/09/martin-luther-king-dream-speech-history\">\u201cI have a dream\u201d</a> speech. \u201cOutside of the Newport and Monterey festivals, I had never seen such a large, integrated crowd coming together for a common purpose,\u201d writes Hentoff. \u201cAs jazz reached deeply into more white Americans, America began to change.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a3fef269caebd3854982d9049aef4ec0119e8868\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a3fef269caebd3854982d9049aef4ec0119e8868/60_47_4783_3146/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The crowd at the Monterey jazz festival, 1960\" width=\"1000\" height=\"658\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The crowd at the Monterey jazz festival, 1960.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: \u00a9 Jim Marshall Photography LLC</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Though dispatched to Newport and Monterey to cover the performers, Marshall also turned his relentlessly curious eye on the audience, shooting beatniks and hipsters, Ivy League students and elegantly dressed young women, as well as celebrities such as folk icon Joan Baez, and the actor Steve McQueen, whom he caught deep in conversation with a young Miles Davis. His photographs often possess a sense of quiet power that only comes with proximity to your subject and, for all his attitude, Marshall seems to have been so ubiquitous as to be invisible to his. In his images of Coltrane, Davis and Ornette Coleman, you sense the rapt intensity of their playing, while a young Nina Simone seems almost meditative as she performs in semi-darkness.</p> <p>In 1966, Marshall also trained his camera on Jefferson Airplane and the Paul Butterfield Blues Band, who were among the first wave of rock groups to play at the Monterey jazz festival. Change was in the air and the following year Marshall would capture Hendrix setting light to his guitar at the Monterey pop festival, a moment that, in retrospect, announced the start of the second wave of \u2013 bigger, brasher, louder \u2013 music festivals in the late 1960s. Marshall rode that wave too, chronicling the three-day Woodstock festival in 1969 \u2013 which he later described as \u201corganised chaos\u201d \u2013 and making his name as one of the great rock photographers of the time, despite gaining a reputation for excess that matched that of even his most dissolute subjects.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a9a5c6d4d53b25785ac095b6c259d28fd46deebe\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a9a5c6d4d53b25785ac095b6c259d28fd46deebe/0_23_4541_2896/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Nina Simone at the Newport Jazz Festival in 1963.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"638\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Nina Simone at the Newport Jazz Festival in 1963.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: \u00a9 Jim Marshall Photography LLC</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cHe got pigeonholed as a rock photographer, but jazz was his first great subject,\u201d says Davis. \u201cFor him it was very personal work and, though he was right there with great jazz photographers like <a href=\"http://www.williamclaxton.com/jazz--music.html\">Bill Claxton</a>, he has never really got the respect for it he deserved.\u201d</p> <p><em>Jazz Festival</em> should go some way to re-establishing Marshall\u2019s reputation as a photographer who, despite his tough image, made some of the most tenderly observed, quietly powerful studies of a now long gone, but still resonant, cultural moment when jazz was both a unifying force for change and the soundtrack to a turbulent nation whose discontents reverberate to this day.</p> <p><em>Jazz Festival is published by Reel Art Press (\u00a345). </em><a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/catalog/product/view/id/413333/\"><em>Click here</em></a><em> to order it for \u00a336.90</em></p>",

They did not look a side destined for a quick return to the purgatory they took so long to escape from but it will be about how they finish, not start.</p> <p>Quins complacently ran an early penalty only to be turned over by Jack Lam. It prompted a 25-minute period of such dominance by Bristol that it was Harlequins who appeared to be the newly promoted side \u2013 hesitant in defence, slipshod in attack and laden with a sackful of gifts. Bristol sought, and found, space with Pisi operating from deep, Henson achieving width with his trademark passing and Hurrell finding holes in the defence.</p> <p>It was surprising that it took Bristol 20 minutes to score their first try, presented to them by the Quins captain, Danny Care, who ran a quick penalty from just outside his own 22. His attempt to find Marland Yarde with a pass that was undermined by the wet and as the ball fell well short of his target Tom Varndell marked his return to the Premiership with a 35-metre intercept and a typically opportunistic try.</p> <p>Quins were sufficiently shaken to take the three points when presented with their next kickable penalty, but the mistakes multiplied. Yarde blew two half chances by dropping the ball, Bristol stole two lineouts, even though one of the throws was crooked and when Ross Chisholm had the opportunity to peg Bristol back following a turnover he kicked the ball directly into touch.</p> <p>Worse was to come for Chisholm when another poor kick gave Bristol the chance to counterattack from halfway. The full-back chased hard but sold himself in the tackle when Will Cliff picked up the ball, so that when the scrum-half found Pisi the Samoan found himself in space after jinking out of two tackles and even at the age of 34 easily had the pace to see off what remained of the defence.</p> <p>Henson was revelling in his return to the big time, but it ended prematurely when he hobbled off after 29 minutes having been tackled late by Joe Marler, the England prop <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/may/18/joe-marler-pulls-out-england-match-wales-tour-australia\" title=\"\">who was blighted by disciplinary problems last season</a>. . Marler took him out after a kick downfield, but only marginally so, leaving any possible citing to be determined on whether the fact he used his shoulder, rather than his arms, merits a hearing. \u201cMarler got there was early as he could,\u201d said Bristol\u2019s director of rugby, Andy Robinson. \u201cIt is a shame an injury occurs from something like that, but I hope Gav will be fit for Northampton on Sunday.\u201d</p> <p>Bristol\u2019s hold on the game started to weaken without Henson and Quins, profiting from their opponents\u2019 indiscipline, turned an attacking lineout into a driving maul that stalled before a number of backs arrived to add momentum and the ball was funnelled to Yarde, who managed to hold on to it.</p> <p>It would have cut Bristol\u2019s lead to eight points had Jordan Crane, their summer recruit from Leicester, not passed some unsolicited advice to the referee, Luke Pearce. Officials have been told to crack down on dissent this season and Harlequins were given a penalty on halfway. They turned it into another lineout and Chisholm cut the line and fed Joe Marchant with a try-scoring pass that was ruled not forward on review.</p> <p>The lead did not settle Quins, who, within one minute of the restart, had supplied Bristol with another try. Ryan Edwards chased his own kick ahead with hope rather than expectation as it bounced towards the try line, outpaced by Marchant and Tim Visser. Marchant fell on the ball but lost control after aquaplaning and Edwards reached it just before Visser.</p> <p>Quins stirred themselves enough to mount more pressure without ever looking convincing. Bristol had half-chances through Varndell and Ollie Robinson, who charged down Nick Evans\u2019s lazy free-kick only to be just beaten to the bounce by Chisholm. The visitors were undermined by their indiscipline and two Evans penalties gave Harlequins a victory they barely merited.

Rashford had made him \u201cnervous\u201d, Manuel Pellegrini said of a World Cup finalist and four-times Bundesliga winner, with 50 international caps for&#xa0;Argentina.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/sep/03/sam-allardyce-england-system-personnel-slovakia\">Sam Allardyce will change England\u2019s system but not personnel | Michael Cox</a> </p> </aside>  <p>When Rashford can have that effect on opponents it certainly feels strange, to say the least, that Sam Allardyce is not hoping for a sprinkling of that stardust in his first match as England manager and a waste, more than anything, that the player will turn out instead at the Weston Homes Community Stadium, home of Colchester United, on Tuesday for an under-21s\u2019 assignment against Norway.</p> <p>Allardyce\u2019s misgivings about the player\u2019s lack of first-team starts would be easier to understand, perhaps, if he had expressed them 20 games into the new season, rather than two, as it was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/aug/25/marcus-rashford-selected-for-england-under21s-after-losing-place-in-senior-squad-manchester-united\" title=\"\">when the under-21s\u2019 squad was named</a>. It doesn\u2019t make great sense that the decision was made so early and, for such an experienced manager, it is not easy to understand why Allardyce did not wait until the Hull game to see if it threw up any clues. Had he done so, he would have been reminded this is a player of uncommon gifts \u2013 a player who has outgrown the under-21s without actually playing for them once.</p> <p>It does, however, highlight the potential problem for Rashford this season now that Zlatan Ibrahimovic forms the arrowhead of United\u2019s attack and inevitably that has turned a light back on Jos\u00e9 Mourinho\u2019s perceived reluctance to trust young, homegrown players.</p> <p>Perhaps with good reason, too, if we recall Mourinho\u2019s introductory press conference at Old Trafford and the attempted deception \u2013 classic Jos\u00e9 \u2013 when he produced a sheet of paper containing 55 names to nail \u201cthe lie\u201d that he never brought through academy players only for it to materialise, on closer inspection, that his list included Arjen Robben, Mario Balotelli, Mikel John Obi and various assorted ringers.</p> <p>Robben, to put it into context, had won 10 caps for Holland, played in more than 100 games in the Eredivisie, won the league with PSV Eindhoven, won his country\u2019s young player of the year award and starred in Euro 2004 before joining Chelsea for \u00a312m, aged 20.</p> <p>Various others on Mourinho\u2019s list had made their debuts elsewhere and, as for the legitimate ones, only 11 had played 90 minutes or more under his management. Ten had played fewer than 10 minutes. Three had appeared for a single minute and, not for the first time with Mourinho, an old quote came to mind from Val\u00e9ry Giscard d\u2019Estaing, the former president of France. \u201cJacques Chirac,\u201d he said, \u201ccould have his mouth full of jam, his lips can be dripping with the stuff, his fingers covered with it, the pot can be standing open in front of him. And when you ask him if he\u2019s a jam-eater, he\u2019ll say: \u2018Me eat jam? Never.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>To be fair to Mourinho, he is probably entitled sometimes to point out Louis van Gaal gave first-team debuts to 14 players from United\u2019s academy and when it came to the crunch it did not spare him from the sack. The bare fact, however, is that in Mourinho\u2019s three months at Old Trafford 13 of the club\u2019s academy graduates have already left for other clubs. Eight have been permanent deals. Five have gone on loan and it would not be a huge shock if this is the season that breaks the remarkable run of matches, currently 3,790, of United having at least one homegrown player in their team, or on the bench, in every match since 1937.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/sep/03/manchester-united-city-preview-jose-mourinho-pep-guardiola-premier-league\">Manchester derby could shape the Premier League season | Paul Wilson</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Unfortunately for United, the conveyor belt at Old Trafford is not what it once was in terms of quality, rather than quantity and, as Nicky Butt confessed the other day, in his new role as head of academy, a club that once prided themselves on being the most prolific nurturers of young talent in English football \u201cveered off course a little bit\u201d.</p> <p>Ed Woodward, United\u2019s executive vice-chairman, ordered a \u201croot and branch review\u201d last season and it brings to mind a conversation at Old Trafford towards the end of Van Gaal\u2019s time and the revelation from inside the dressing room that some of the senior players were not exactly impressed by the next generation. Rashford was the exception \u2013 the only player they enthused about \u2013 and, however brief it was, he was also the only one in England\u2019s colours to emerge with any distinction from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/jun/27/england-iceland-euro-2016-match-report\" title=\"\">that infamous night against Iceland in Euro 2016</a> when Wayne Rooney could be seen fumbling over the ball, Raheem Sterling\u2019s confidence looked broken and <em>L\u2019Equipe</em> gave Joe Hart, Gary Cahill and Harry Kane (and Roy Hodgson, for that matter) three out of 10 in their match ratings. Rashford might have been on the pitch only five minutes but in that time there were three occasions when he took the ball past a defender \u2013 more dribbles than anyone else had managed all night.</p> <p>It is a shame therefore that Allardyce would rather hold him back and a bit of a recurring theme if we think back to how, a couple of months before Euro 2016, Rashford could not even get in the under-21s because Gareth Southgate wanted to \u201ctake the heat away\u201d from a player who had scored five goals in his first eight United games. \u201cIt was a bit early for him, exposure-wise,\u201d Southgate explained. Others might consider that someone freely scoring goals in the Premier League, including the winner in the Manchester derby the previous weekend, would not have been too fazed facing Switzerland Under-21s at the home of Thun, in front of 2,589 spectators.</p> <p>A measure of caution has to be applied, of course, but not too much when Rashford is older than Michael Owen was at the 1998 World Cup and than Rooney was at Euro 2004, and has scored in his first matches for Van Gaal, Hodgson and Mourinho. Allardyce might yet be next on that list but, for the time being, the bright hope of English football is on his way to Colchester and it is difficult not to feel it might be England, not United, who are guilty of underusing him.</p> <h2>Ag\u00fcero makes case for TV refs</h2> <p>Judging by the positive vibes from Italy\u2019s friendly against France, the first-ever international match to experiment with a video referee, the time is clearly coming when the technology is introduced properly, with an extra official wired up in a van outside the stadium (bringing not just clarity on various decisions but also, no doubt, future chants of \u201cWho\u2019s the bastard in the van?\u201d).</p> <p>No doubt the idea will polarise opinion when the common perception it that stopping games to check video footage will delay the flow and \u2013 admittedly, not the greatest argument \u2013 quite a few of us actually like a dash of controversy and&#xa0;regard refereeing mistakes as part of&#xa0;the fun.</p> <p>It is certainly easy to have misgivings if you think back to the tackle on Luke Shaw, playing for Manchester United against PSV Eindhoven last September, that broke his leg in two places <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2015/sep/19/referees-luke-shaw-technology\" title=\"\">and the analysis of some of the various former referees</a> who now work in the media. Howard Webb\u2019s verdict was that the PSV player, H\u00e9ctor Moreno, had made a hard but fair challenge. Graham Poll argued it was a red-card offence and Mark Halsey went even further, saying it was a \u201chorrendous challenge\u201d and \u201cabsolutely baffling\u201d that the Italian referee, Nicola Rizzoli, did not take action. All of them had seen the various camera angles; the fact they could not agree just shows the potential for problems.</p> <p>The doubters among us might, however, reflect on Sergio Ag\u00fcero\u2019s clash with Winston Reid last weekend when a video referee would presumably have been able to clarify what happened and a red card could have been shown to the Manchester City striker.</p> <p>Ag\u00fcero will miss City\u2019s next three matches because of the FA taking retrospective action but, as Pep Guardiola said, it will still be 11 versus 11 in each of those games. West Ham were the real losers given that the offence took place in the part of the match after Michail Antonio\u2019s goal had brought the score back to 2-1, with a quarter of an hour still to play and the home team starting to look edgy.</p> <p>Nobody can know what might have happened if Ag\u00fcero was sent off but West Ham\u2019s chances of finding an equaliser, rather than going on to concede a third goal, would clearly have been improved by having an extra man. That is the real injustice from the Ag\u00fcero saga other than the insinuation, with City protesting the player\u2019s innocence, that it must have been pretend agony that put Reid on the floor.</p> <h2>Poyet will surely find a new home </h2> <p>That was a nice line in irony from Michael Owen \u2013 and let\u2019s give him the benefit of the doubt and assume it was deliberate \u2013 in his analysis of J\u00fcrgen Klopp\u2019s transfer business at Liverpool. \u201cI like the way Klopp clears out players he doesn\u2019t need,\u201d Owen declared on Twitter, perhaps drawing on his memories at Newcastle United, Manchester United and Stoke City. \u201cNo messing. Nothing worse than having senior pros floating round not contributing.\u201d</p> <p>Unfortunately, it wasn\u2019t all levity on deadline day and, however confident Tottenham might be of bringing out Moussa Sissoko\u2019s Euro 2016 form, rather than the Newcastle equivalent, it doesn\u2019t reflect well on the \u00a330m signing if the allegations emanating from Merseyside are true that he did not even answer Ronald Koeman\u2019s calls to explain why he would not be moving to Everton, after all.</p> <p>Mario Balotelli\u2019s departure from Liverpool, bundled out of Anfield\u2019s back door on a free transfer to Nice, is depressing in another way and, speaking of wasted talent, it probably says everything for Ravel Morrison\u2019s broken reputation that&#xa0;a player with his exquisite talent could not find a taker in England\u2019s top two&#xa0;divisions.</p> <p>On a different note, it was sad to see Diego Poyet cutting his ties with West Ham, even if it has quickly become apparent that there are plenty of clubs willing to offer him a way back. It is only two years since Poyet, then 19, won Charlton Athletic\u2019s player-of-the-year award and was showing the kind of refined touches that made it something of a coup for West Ham when they signed him on a Bosman deal that summer.</p> <p>He has lost his momentum since then but at least there is hope. The people at West Ham all speak highly of him and the FA was extremely keen for Poyet to align himself to England before his decision to play for Uruguay Under-20s last year. He is still young and there is plenty of time for all that rich potential to flower.</p>",
  "<p>There was too much rain for Limato, the morning favourite for this Sprint Cup, who was withdrawn when it became clear beyond argument that the going would be soft. It was even feared there might be too much rain for Quiet Reflection, a filly who was known to like some give underfoot but did not want it bottomless. Those fears proved needless as she could be called the winner soon after halfway.</p> <p>At that point, she was hacking along behind the leaders under a motionless Dougie Costello, who looks so comfortable in 50-second races these days that it is hard to believe he was a jump jockey until about 18 months ago. Together, they bagged their second Group One success of the year, following the Commonwealth Cup at Royal Ascot in June.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s unbelievable,\u201d marvelled the winning jockey. \u201cWhen you read in the paper, the likes of Franny Norton who\u2019ve been riding all these years and have just not been lucky enough to land one [a Group One] and I come in on my first year, get on a filly like this \u2026 I\u2019m still dreaming.\u201d</p> <p>Norton, a 46-year-old whose chance ride on Dancing Star gave him an obvious chance of a first victory at racing\u2019s highest level, trailed home ninth as his filly tired. Costello tipped his hat to his older rival. \u201cHe must be looking at this big jump jockey who comes in on the Flat and rides two Group One winners, he must be a little bit pissed off. But these days, every jockey in there rides excellent. There\u2019s only a megapixel between them all.\u201d</p> <p>Karl Burke, the trainer of Quiet Reflection, now uses Costello as his main jockey. \u201cFor a lad that\u2019s been riding on the Flat not much more than a year, to go out in those races and be so cool is all credit to him,\u201d Burke said. \u201cHe was very cool and I think that reflects the confidence he has in the filly.\u201d</p> <p>Burke\u2019s confidence, however, had been rather rocked by the deluge that dropped 16mm on this course, most of it in the last three hours before the big race. \u201cI know we wanted a bit of rain but I was a bit worried when it came that soft. I thought it was going to play into the hands of the older horses.\u201d</p> <p>One older horse who would have been well suited by conditions is Twilight Son, the winner of this race last year, who was taken out at Thursday\u2019s final entry stage because the ground was expected to be on the quick side for him. A turn in the weather made that a regrettable decision. His trainer, Henry Candy, came here with Limato, who wanted a dry surface but may now have to wait until spring to get it, though Candy may consider France\u2019s Prix de la For\u00eat.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/sep/03/32red-william-hill-king-george-vi-chase-sponsorship\">32Red replaces William Hill after seven-year King George VI Chase sponsorship</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Quiet Reflection, meanwhile, will be aimed at Ascot\u2019s Champion Sprint next month, where Twilight Son may be lying in wait.</p> <p>Burke\u2019s other win on this card was largely the work of Clifford Lee, one of the apprentice finds of this season, who achieved the most valuable success of his fledgling career in the 32Red Handicap, making all aboard Intense Tango. While it was a canny ride, Lee must have been relieved to hold on by a head in a photo finish, having put up 3lb overweight, which would have looked profligate if the verdict had gone the other way.</p> <p>The 20-year-old Lee acquired a love of racing by watching it on TV while growing up in Kent. \u201cHe\u2019s a little bit on the heavy side but he\u2019s young and he hasn\u2019t quite worked out the art of wasting properly, or dieting properly,\u201d Burke said.</p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s quite a broad lad, when you look at him, and he did a bit of boxing, so he\u2019s a strong lad.

On the campaign trail, Hillary Clinton has vowed to overturn the decision and push for limits on the amount of money corporations and unions can spend on campaigns.</p> <p>The case, Citizens United v the Federal Election Commission, stemmed from a decision by the FEC to block the conservative advocacy group, from publishing an unfavorable documentary about Hillary Clinton in early 2008, when she was locked in a tough primary battle with Barack Obama. </p> <p>The supreme court case was only one iteration of a deeply antagonistic relationship between Hillary Clinton and Citizens United that dates to before her husband was president.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/1997/11/13/a-firefighters-blazing-trail/b9beb874-fd7b-4dfe-b285-ffcd385501a2/?postshare=6751472783643926&amp;tid=ss_tw\">A 1997 Washington Post profile</a> of Bossie traces his first turn on the national stage to 1992, when a CBS documentary identified him as one of two men who had been harassing the parents and friends of a young woman who had killed herself some years before.

He was pushed to resign in 1998 amid criticism of his overzealous tactics. </p> <p>In the profile, published one year before his resignation, the Post compared Bossie to Roy Cohn, the bare-knuckled right-hand man for Senator Joe McCarthy who mentored Donald Trump. </p> <p>Before joining Trump\u2019s campaign, Bossie served as president of Citizens United and head of the Super Pac Defeat Crooked Hillary. He has taken a leave of absence from both organizations while he serves on Trump\u2019s campaign. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/26/steve-bannon-domestic-violence-trump-campaign-ceo\">Steve Bannon, Trump campaign CEO, faced domestic violence charges</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Bossie is among a slate of recent top-level hires that include Stephen Bannon, the former head of the conspiracy theory-laden website, Breitbart News, where <a href=\"http://www.breitbart.com/author/david-bossie/\">Bossie has occasionally been published</a>, and Kellyanne Conway, a Republican pollster and strategist. </p> <p>The triumvirate of new hires are close allies of shadowy hedge-fund billionaire Robert Mercer.

  "<p>It was more end-of-season leftovers than new campaign fare: a smorgasbord of fumbles, slips and misdirected passes before Saracens constricted their opponents into submission. If the champions were not at their best, they did not need to be against a side that spent most of the match on the back foot.</p> <p>Worcester looked to make up for the difference between the sides on paper by rushing up in defence and denying Saracens space, a tactic that yielded early turnovers but so wasteful was their kicking out of hand that Alex Goode had far too much time to launch counterattacks. The Warriors were never able to relieve pressure, blocking off their own exit routes, but this will be another season when their destiny will be decided by how they get on against the sides in the bottom, rather than the top, half of the table.</p> <p>Saracens\u2019 headline England acts were not immune from the malaise that plagued the opening period.

Their defensive effort was epitomised by the way Te\u2019o felled the burly Jamie George, but almost constant defence exerted a physical toll and either side of the interval the Warriors conceded penalties for trying to relieve the onslaught by doing whatever it took to slow down the ball at the ruck.</p> <p>Lozowski, making his debut after joining from Wasps where he made seven appearances as a substitute last season for a total of 104 minutes on the field, missed two penalties almost in front of the posts from medium range before ending the first half by nailing a kick from the touchline. He extended his side\u2019s lead three minutes after the restart with his third successful kick.</p> <p>Worcester\u2019s offences betrayed their weakening tacklers; flopping off their feet at the breakdown, coming in from the side and kicking the ball out of the scrum-half\u2019s feet.</p> <p>Saracens were some way short of their fluent best but as Billy Vunipola started to break tackles and Burger settled into the game they kept it simple and direct, eventually forcing their way over the line.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/sep/01/premiership-guide-2016-17-andy-goode-verdict\">Premiership guide 2016-17: Andy Goode gives his expert view of the season ahead</a> </p> </aside>  <p>George scored their first try on 45 minutes, at the heart of a driving maul after Brad Barritt had instructed that a penalty be kicked to touch.

  "<p>Indigenous peoples in Peru are demanding to be consulted about a proposed electricity transmission line that would run for approximately 586 kms through the Amazon. The stated aim of the line is to connect Iquitos in Peru\u2019s northeast, often described as the world\u2019s largest city or town without road or rail access, to the national grid.</p> <p>Doing so would mean crossing the territories of numerous indigenous peoples, including the Achuars, Kandozis, Kichwas, Kukamas-Kukamirias and Urarinas. Representative organisations are expressing serious concern about the project\u2019s potential impacts and say they have not been consulted about it despite the government\u2019s obligation to do so under Peruvian and international law. </p> <p>The proposed line would also run through the Abanico del Rio Pastaza, a huge wetlands complex stretching across the border into Ecuador. In 2002 3.8 million hectares of the Abanico were declared a Wetland of International Importance, or Ramsar Site, under the Ramsar Convention, making it the largest Ramsar Site in Latin America and the eighth largest worldwide out of a total of 2,241.</p> <p>According to ORPIO, an Iquitos-based federation representing 15 indigenous peoples, the potential impacts of the line include the destruction of 874,000 tonnes of trees, the release of 424,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide, massive biodiversity and game loss, conflict, the resettlement of indigenous communities, and encouraging the entrance of colonists, illegal loggers, gold-miners and coca farmers.</p> <p>ORPIO is taking legal action against the Energy Ministry (MINEM) and government agency ProInversion in an attempt to suspend construction of the line, filing a lawsuit in Iquitos arguing they have not been consulted about it.</p> <p>\u201cWe urge that our request for prior consultation, according to the International Labour Organization\u2019s Convention 169 and other current national and international legislation, is respected, given that the Moyobamba-\u00ccquitos Transmission Line will directly affect our rights,\u201d ORPIO wrote to MINEM in August.</p> <p>CORPI, a federation representing nine indigenous peoples, is also demanding that the right to prior consultation, as the process is termed in Peruvian law, is respected. </p> <p>\u201c[The proposed transmission line] directly affects [indigenous peoples\u2019] collective rights and will impact their access to their subsistence resources and therefore threatens their physical existence, cultural identity, quality of life and spiritual links with the land they have occupied ancestrally,\u201d read a CORPI statement released in February.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"4155322fefdb084eb3170c651422912837eb99e0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4155322fefdb084eb3170c651422912837eb99e0/0_0_2091_2570/814.jpg\" alt=\"A Kichwa woman from the River Tigre, Peru, demanding in 2015 to be consulted about oil operations.

Indigenous people are now requesting to be consulted about the proposed Moyobamba-Iquitos electricity line.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Hill</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>However, MINEM argues that a loophole in a 2012 Peruvian law makes it exempt from doing prior consultation on this occasion. The law states that the \u201cconstruction and maintenance of public service infrastructure\u201d doesn\u2019t require prior consultation if \u201cit is intended to benefit\u201d and is done \u201cin coordination\u201d with indigenous peoples - and since the proposed transmission line is a \u201cpublic service\u201d and \u201cwould benefit indigenous populations in the project\u2019s area of influence\u201d, MINEM claims no consultation is necessary.</p> <p>That argument has been dismissed by Peru\u2019s state ombudsman, the Defensoria del Pueblo, which recommended, on 20 May, that MINEM carry out prior consultation. It claims that the legal loophole isn\u2019t applicable in this case because, among other reasons, the proposed line will <em>not</em> directly benefit the indigenous peoples living in the region. </p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s the population of Iquitos that will be the beneficiary of this project, while the indigenous territories will just be an area through which the transmission line will pass,\u201d the Defensoria\u2019s Daniel Sanchez wrote to MINEM.</p> <p>MINEM\u2019s response to Sanchez, in August, was that indigenous organizations could have appealed its initial decision to forgo prior consultation, made in October 2015, but didn\u2019t do so. It also argued that its interpretation of the 2012 law is in line with that of the Culture Ministry (MINCU), the ministry responsible for indigenous peoples which - conveniently - issued its own interpretation of the loophole in the 2012 law just seven days after Sanchez wrote to MINEM in May.</p> <p>To the Guardian Sanchez described MINEM\u2019s interpretation of the law as \u201cloose and wrong\u201d, \u201cperverting\u201d the right to prior consultation and making the process meaningless. </p> <p>\u201cPrior consultation emerged as a way of promoting indigenous peoples\u2019 participation in projects affecting them [but] I think that a certain sector within MINEM still sees it as an obstacle,\u201d Sanchez says. \u201cSo they\u2019re opposed to its implementation. This is counter-productive because it has been shown that what indigenous peoples want is to be taken into account, to influence and above all to participate in decision-making. Of the 17 extractive projects - hydrocarbons, mining and infrastructure - that have been subject to prior consultation to date, not one of them has been opposed by indigenous representatives.\u201d</p> <p>The opinion that indigenous peoples have the right to prior consultation about the proposed line is shared by lawyer Henry Carhuatocto from NGO IDLADS, which is supporting ORPIO in making its demands heard by the government and media. Carhuatocto calls MINEM\u2019s argument \u201cfrankly lamentable\u201d and agrees the line will not directly benefit indigenous peoples but will instead mean clearing almost 600 kms of forest and indirectly facilitate \u201cinvaders and colonists.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cFirst, we need to make it clear that any legislative or administrative measure affecting the lives of indigenous peoples must be subject to prior consultation,\u201d Carhuatocto told the Guardian. \u201cSecond, prior consultation is not an obstacle to economic development, but a space to comply with human rights agreements and an opportunity for the state to take more of an interest in indigenous peoples, to be able to discuss the impacts of the project with them, to reach agreements in good faith, and for them to give their consent. This is an opportunity for the state to do things right by indigenous peoples and we hope that in this instance it doesn\u2019t fail to take it.\u201d</p> <p>Juan Carlos Ruiz Molleda, from NGO Instituto de Defensa Legal (IDL) which is part of the legal team supporting ORPIO\u2019s lawsuit, makes another argument: that the 2012 law, irrespective of how it is interpreted, is \u201cunconstitutional.\u201d \u201cIf you listen to government functionaries, especially those in MINEM, ProInversion and even MINCU, you always hear the same argument: \u201cBut that\u2019s what it says in the regulation, that\u2019s what it says in the law.\u201d What\u2019s forgotten, however, is that a law can be unconstitutional and therefore invalid,\u201d Ruiz Molleda wrote in a recent article.</p> <p>The Environment Ministry (MINAM) has expressed grave concern about the proposed line and, in a report sent to MINEM in February, recommended considering an alternative route that would have less impact on the Abanico del Pastaza. It also stated that the peat bogs in the region, together with those south of the River Maranon, sequester approximately 50% of Peru\u2019s entire carbon reserves, which it called \u201cextremely relevant\u201d \u201cgiven Peru\u2019s commitments to reduce carbon emissions in order to combat climate change.\u201d</p> <p>In addition, MINAM\u2019s report argued that Peru\u2019s 1993 Constitution states that treaties form part of national law, meaning that the Ramsar Convention is legally binding on Peru. As a contracting party to the Ramsar Convention, which entered into force in the country in 1992, Peru committed to \u201cdesiring to stem the progressive encroachment on and loss of wetlands now and in the future\u201d, and to \u201cpromote the conservation\u201d and \u201cas far as possible the wise use\u201d of wetlands.</p> <p>\u201cThe Abanico del Pastaza is one of the best conserved areas in the Peruvian Amazon, home to almost intact animal populations and plants of enormous relevance for the functioning and integrity of eco-systems and for the economy of the indigenous peoples and riberenos living there,\u201d MINAM\u2019s report stated.</p> <p>The company planning to build the line is Lineas de Transmision Peruanas, owned by Spain-based Isolux Cors\u00e1n. In May MINEM decided against approving an Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) of the project because it failed to adequately address numerous environmental issues, among other reasons, but that decision was appealed by the company and then effectively annulled by Vice-Minister of Energy Raul Perez-Reyes Espejo.</p> <p>\u201cThe Vice-Minister has opened up the possibility that the EIA could be approved,\u201d ORPIO, IDLADS and CORPI announced on 16 August. </p> <p>The justification for the line, according to the EIA, is that it will be a more efficient and less costly way of providing electricity to Iquitos, allowing residents to enjoy a service similar to other cities in Peru already connected to the national grid. </p> <p>\u201cCurrently, Iquitos\u2019s entire electricity supply comes from its thermal power plant which has a total output of 48.4 MW,\u201d the EIA states. \u201cThe oil is transported there by river which means that the supply is subject to high risk because of the difficulties in navigation, weather conditions and environmental implications.\u201d</p> <p>When Isolux Cors\u00e1n won the contract in 2014 the then Vice-Minister of Energy, Edwin Quintanilla Acosta, claimed the proposed line would save 38 million gallons of oil a year and \u201cdinamize\u201d the economies of various Amazon regions.</p> <p>\u201cThe Amazon, 130 years after electricity was first used in Peru, will have clean energy to power its economic take-off,\u201d MINEM reported Quintanilla saying. \u201c\u201cThat enables us to see the future of the country with great optimism.\u201d\u201d</p> <p>Jos\u00e9 Serra Vega, an engineer specialising in energy and the environment who has conducted environmental and economic analyses of the proposed line, argues it would be an \u201cenvironmental disaster.\u201d He claims 8.5 million tonnes of biomass from mostly primary forest could be destroyed, 4.2 million tonnes of carbon dioxide could be released, 1000s of colonists could \u201cinvade\u201d, and the territories of eight indigenous peoples would be directly impacted.</p> <p>Serra Vega claims it would be an \u201ceconomic disaster\u201d too, estimating it will raise electricity prices and could cost Peruvians over a billion dollars. He says that consumers in Iquitos pay less than in Lima for electricity and another company, Genrent, is already building a new thermal power plant in Iquitos that will have 70 MW capacity - when the city\u2019s current maximum demand is 56MW. </p> <p>\u201cThis line isn\u2019t necessary and will cause a prejudice to Peruvian electricity consumers superior to 600 million dollars during the 30 years of its concession,\u201d Serra Vega told the Guardian. </p> <p>The EIA states the line will cost approximately US$500 million and take three years to build, with the preliminary stages employing roughly 800-900 people maximum. The project\u2019s \u201carea of direct influence\u201d is estimated at 100 metres along the entire line. </p> <p>Isolux Cors\u00e1n\u2019s website states that it acts with \u201cscrupulous respect towards the principles included in the Declaration of Human Rights\u201d and minimises \u201cthe environmental impact our activities might occasion.\u201d The company is also a signatory to the UN Global Compact, which means it has committed to, among other things, \u201csupport and respect the protection of internationally proclaimed human rights\u201d and \u201cundertake initiatives to promote greater environmental responsibility.\u201d</p> <p>MINEM and Isolux Cors\u00e1n did not respond to questions.</p>",
  "<p>Mike Ashley and the board of Sports Direct face a showdown with shareholders this week over a host of problems \u2013 including treatment of its employees, corporate governance and ailing performance.</p> <p>Investors in the controversial firm, which has faced months of pressure over working conditions for staff, get their chance to quiz directors at Sports Direct\u2019s annual meeting in Shirebrook, Derbyshire, on Wednesday.</p> <p>Ashley, who founded the company and still owns 55%, is the executive deputy chairman and will attend but in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/sep/09/sports-direct-investors-revolt-against-chairman-and-pay-policy\" title=\"\">the past he has stayed quiet</a>, leaving the difficult job of answering questions to chairman Keith Hellawell and chief executive Dave Forsey.</p> <p>Thousands of Sports Direct warehouse workers are to receive back pay totalling about \u00a31m after the retailer admitted breaking the law by not paying the national minimum wage. And the company and its employment agencies are facing fines of up to \u00a32m imposed by the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) after they were found to have been underpaying workers for four years.</p> <p>So, after a tumultuous year for the retailer, these are the questions that investors should ask at the AGM.</p> <h2><br><strong>What improvements have been made to working conditions in the main warehouse in Shirebrook?</strong><br></h2> <p>MPs on the business, innovation and skills committee <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jul/22/mike-ashley-running-sports-direct-like-victorian-workhouse\" title=\"\">claimed that Ashley was running Sports Direct like a \u201cVictorian workhouse\u201d</a>. Ashley himself <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jun/07/mike-ashley-admits-sports-direct-staff-were-not-paid-minimum-wage\" title=\"\">told the parliamentary committee in June</a> that an internal review of Sports Direct\u2019s working practices uncovered \u201cunpleasant surprises\u201d. Shareholders need to clarify what improvements have been made since then, other than Sports Direct increasing pay for staff and agreeing to pay warehouse workers back pay after a <em>Guardian</em> investigation exposed that it was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jun/07/sports-direct-agrees-back-pay-deal-with-hmrc-minimum-wage\" title=\"\">effectively not paying the national minimum wage</a>. RPC, the law firm, will this week publish its report on Ashley\u2019s review of working conditions, but leading shareholders believe this is not independent because RPC is a regular adviser to Sports Direct. The company should provide indisputable evidence about the changes it has made.</p> <h2><strong>What\u2019s the status of the HM Revenue &amp; Customs inquiry into Sports Direct?</strong><br></h2> <p>Even though Sports Direct has reached an agreement with HMRC and trade unions about back pay for staff in the Shirebrook warehouse, HMRC is still understood to be investigating the retailer about whether workers in its warehouse and shops were paid less than the national minimum wage. The threat of a multimillion pound fine hangs over the company.</p> <h2><strong>Will Keith Hellawell resign as chairman if a majority of independent shareholders fail to support him?</strong><br></h2> <p>Sports Direct is facing a major rebellion at its annual meeting, with institutional directors threatening to vote against the re-election of former policeman Keith Hellawell as chairman. If a majority of independent shareholders vote against him, Ashley could use his 55% stake to protect Hellawell at a second vote. However, surely Hellawell\u2019s position will be untenable if there is a major rebellion. The chairman is supposed to represent all shareholders and keep a company\u2019s management in check.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"37298caa56b77b5a6fb17500afea4c91c4fbfc5e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/37298caa56b77b5a6fb17500afea4c91c4fbfc5e/1224_0_3841_4802/800.jpg\" alt=\"Sports Direct chief executive Dave Forsey.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sports Direct chief executive Dave Forsey.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sport Direct/PA WIRE</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>Who is conducting the review of the company\u2019s board and do you pledge to publish and implement its findings?</strong><br></h2> <p>Sports Direct announced last month that an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/blog/2016/aug/18/sports-direct-doesnt-need-consultants-it-should-listen-to-its-shareholders\" title=\"\">\u201cexternal evaluation\u201d of its board will take place later this year</a>. It is a minimum requirement of any FTSE company to conduct a review every three years but, given the concerns about the dominance of Ashley on the Sports Direct board, the suitability of Hellawell as chairman, and the lack of a permanent finance director, investors should push for information on who will conduct this evaluation and ensure that its recommendations are implemented.</p> <h2><strong>When will you appoint a permanent finance director?</strong><br></h2> <p>Sports Direct has not had a permanent finance director since December 2013, when Bob Mellors stepped down for health reasons. Matt Pearson is filling the role on an interim basis, but it is unprecedented for a listed company to go so long without a permanent finance director. Major shareholders believe this is another sign of the slack corporate governance at Sports Direct and the power that Ashley wields over the business.</p> <h2><strong>Why is the delivery of online orders overseas being managed from a house in Cleethorpes?</strong><br></h2> <p>The latest controversy to engulf Sports Direct was the news that it <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/22/sports-direct-pays-mike-ashleys-older-brother-international-delivery\" title=\"\">pays an obscure company, owned by Mike Ashley\u2019s brother,</a> to deliver online orders outside the UK. Barlin Delivery Limited is owned by John Ashley and registered to a detached house in Lincolnshire. It makes a profit of \u00a3300,000 a year from the arrangement with Sports Direct, although it is not clear if this is after salaries and dividends, and uses DHL to actually deliver goods. Sports Direct needs to explain why this arrangement with John Ashley is the most efficient way to manage orders, how much has been paid to Barlin, and why this was not disclosed as a related-party transaction in its accounts.</p> <h2><strong>How would you describe your relationship with suppliers, particularly Adidas?</strong><br></h2> <p>Amid the controversy about working practices and corporate governance, Sports Direct is also finding trading tough in Britain and Europe. One of the reasons for this is that major suppliers are not providing the company with their most popular products, choosing to go through their own shops or Sports Direct\u2019s rival, JD, instead. For example, Adidas does not provide Sports Direct with its replica football kits, including Manchester United\u2019s, nor its latest trainers.</p> <h2><strong>Are you finding it more difficult to attract and keep staff?</strong><br></h2> <p>Staff turnover at Sports Direct <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/11/sports-directs-high-staff-turnover-puts-further-pressure-on-mike-ashley\" title=\"\">rose by more than three percentage points last year to 22%</a>, according to its annual report. The figure is almost three times the average turnover rate of 8% for UK employers, but is lower than other retailers. Two concerns spring out from with this statistic \u2013 is Sports Direct losing its most talented shop workers and warehouse staff as a result of poor working conditions, and is the company struggling to attract new talent? This could explain why the retailer has not replaced Hellawell or hired a permanent finance director.</p> <h2><strong>Is Mike Ashley still committed to Sports Direct?</strong><br></h2> <p>Sports Direct stated in its annual results that Ashley had told the board he had no plans to buy the shares in the company that he does not hold and take it private. However, the annual meeting is a chance for the man himself to outline his plans in person. Sports Direct shares are trading at around 325p, way down on their 2014 peak of 922p and only just above the 300p the firm floated at in 2007. Ashley could well be tempted to take the company off the stock market, which would end the criticism from City institutions and other shareholders. Alternatively, he could sell more of his shares, even reducing his holding below 50%. After all, Ashley told MPs that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/sports-direct-international\" title=\"\">Sports Direct</a> may have become too big for him and the tycoon has stepped back from day-to-day control of Newcastle United, the football club he owns.</p> <h2>OPEN DAY AT HEADQUARTERS</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1fbc379676fc6161456a73259b5c8852a79a1433\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1fbc379676fc6161456a73259b5c8852a79a1433/0_74_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A Sports Direct worker in the Shirebrook warehouse.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ashley has admitted that he paid workers below the minimum wage.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Joe Giddens/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Sports Direct is opening its doors to members of the public on the day of the annual meeting.</p> <p>Usually only shareholders, and occasionally journalists, are invited to attend annual meetings, but Sports Direct says it wants to enable the board, including Mike Ashley, to \u201cengage with as many people as possible in an open discussion about the business\u201d.</p> <p>The invitation will allow critics of the company, such as MPs and trade unions, to attend.

Appearing before <a href=\"http://www.hsgac.senate.gov/subcommittees/investigations/hearings/offshore-profit-shifting-and-the-us-tax-code_-part-2\">a US senate committee</a>, the man who runs the world\u2019s largest company told the politicians straight: Apple had no intention of repatriating billions of dollars of profits from its international operations until the US Treasury slashed corporate taxation.</p> <p>\u201cI have no current plan to bring them back at the current tax rate,\u201d Cook said.</p> <p>It was a response \u2013 one of many \u2013 that rankled with the committee\u2019s chair, Carl Levin. Leaning forward, the tough septuagenarian senator from Michigan glared at Cook over the top of his glasses: \u201cIt is not your intent to bring them home unless we reduce our tax rates? Is that correct?\u201d</p> <p>Cook repeated: \u201cI have no current plan to do so at the current tax rates.\u201d</p> <p>It was a charged exchange that laid bare the impasse between corporate America and Washington. At that time, Apple had amassed about $100bn in cash \u2013 income from its foreign operations \u2013 all of which was being carefully held outside America, beyond the reach of the US tax authorities.</p> <p>Since then, every three months, Apple has given Wall Street an update on the size of this cash pile, and each time the figure has grown by several billion. At last count, six weeks ago, the figure stood at $215bn (\u00a3162bn).</p> <p>If Apple were to bring that money back to the US, however, it would be taxed at about 40%, one of the highest tax rates in the world. \u201cApple serves its shareholders by keeping these funds overseas,\u201d the Californian technology firm told the senators.</p> <p>By using a long-standing loophole in the tax code, Apple, in common with many other multinationals, can continually defer US taxes on these offshore earnings for as long as they are kept outside America.</p> <p>This is a quirk of US law that has had a dramatic, and increasingly unsustainable, impact on the corporate world. It has meant that many of the richest firms in the US are amassing huge, untaxed offshore cash piles. In recent, years that trend has been accelerated by America\u2019s booming leading tech firms and their worldwide success.</p> <p>According to ratings agency Moody\u2019s, US companies, excluding banks, had an estimated $1.2 trillion in cash overseas at the end of last year. Just over half of that sum \u2013 $630bn \u2013 is estimated to be held by Apple and other tech companies, among them Silicon Valley firms Microsoft ($96bn), Cisco ($57bn), Google ($43bn) and Oracle ($45bn).</p> <p>Barack Obama promised he would get corporate America to bring profits home, as have both the Republican and Democrat candidates vying to succeed him. Quite how to do so, however, has divided Washington for decades.</p> <p>And if the result has been intransigence, few have complained very loudly. The impasse has suited corporate America well, allowing its biggest international businesses to enjoy years of ultra-low tax bills.</p> <p>Last week, however, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/30/apple-pay-back-taxes-eu-ruling-ireland-state-aid\">dramatic intervention of Europe\u2019s competition commissioner Margrethe Vestager </a>appeared to steal the reform initiative from Washington.</p> <p>In a decision that for many years tax experts would have thought unthinkable, she ruled that a significant slice of Apple\u2019s offshore wealth had been illegally won. The iPhone maker, Vestager found, had been benefiting from a sweetheart tax deal agreed behind closed doors with Ireland a quarter of a century ago. That deal had resulted in Apple avoiding \u20ac13bn in taxes over 10 years, she said: those back taxes, plus interest, would have to be repaid.</p> <p>Cook was furious. He insisted that the income had already been taxed in Europe. \u201cThe commission is now calling to retroactively change those rules,\u201d he protested last Tuesday. Two days later he was still raging \u2014 calling Vestager\u2019s decision \u201cinvalid\u201d and \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/sep/01/political-crap-tim-cook-apple-tax-ruling\">crap</a>\u201d \u2014 but he also had a surprise announcement. During an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/sep/01/apple-boss-tim-cook-repatriate-billions-to-us-treasury-next-year\">interview on Irish radio,</a> he started talking about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/sep/01/apple-boss-tim-cook-repatriate-billions-to-us-treasury-next-year\">repatriating cash held overseas </a>and paying US tax. \u201cRight now, I would forecast that we repatriate next year,\u201d he said. \u201cWe [have] provisioned several billion for the US for payment [of tax bills] as soon as we repatriate.\u201d</p> <p>There has been no further elaboration, but it is a marked change in tone from Cook, who now needs all the support he can muster from allies on Capitol Hill. Hints that Apple might be more willing to pay tax in America might be just the kind of message US politicians wanted to hear.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5a0fc93f0c5b0cb05a2bd00d6410781ae8444c12\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5a0fc93f0c5b0cb05a2bd00d6410781ae8444c12/0_61_3884_2331/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Margrethe Vestager\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Margrethe Vestager: demanding \u20ac13bn in back taxes from Apple in Ireland.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: John Thys/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The Apple boss certainly has friends in high places. Recent months have seen him host fundraising events for both Democratic presidential candidate Hilary Clinton and Republican house speaker Paul Ryan.</p> <p>For all that, however, few US politicians have come out fighting hard to defend Apple\u2019s Irish tax arrangements. There have some generalised warnings from US Treasury secretary Jack Lew that the commission\u2019s move could have a \u201cchilling effect on US-EU cross-border investment\u201d and that Washington would have to \u201cconsider potential responses\u201d.</p> <p>But as global leaders gather in Hangzhou, China, on Sunday for the latest G20 summit, there are little signs of Apple\u2019s \u20ac13bn back-taxes penalty causing a full-blown crisis.</p> <p>Behind the scenes, dissatisfaction over corporate America and its untaxed offshore cash is growing. Politicians may not yet have figured out what they intend to do about this issue, but the last 18 months have provided a few stark reminders that there is a lot at stake.</p> <p>Last November, many in Washington were surprised to see Pfizer, one of America\u2019s largest drug makers, unveiling plans for a record-breaking $160bn deal \u2013 a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/apr/06/pfizer-allergan-tax-inversion-deal-merger\">so-called \u201ctax inversion\u201d</a> transaction which would see it merge with a smaller, foreign rival and shift its headquarters outside the US.</p> <p>The Pfizer bid was just the latest, and largest, in a wave of such inversion deals. Such transactions are designed to allow multinationals greater freedom to use their swollen cash reserves without triggering US tax bills.</p> <p>In the end, however, the Obama administration moved quickly enough to introduce tougher rules to discourage inversion deals, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/apr/05/pfizer-allergan-merger-tax-avoidance-rules\">thwarting Pfizer\u2019s plans</a>. But it was yet another wake-up call: corporate America\u2019s untaxed offshore cash pile was a problem that needed fixing.</p> <p>Most tax reform experts concede Apple\u2019s Irish tax arrangements are hard to defend as fair. Pascal Saint-Amans, head of tax at the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), who last year secured unprecedented agreement on reforms to tackle tax avoidance, is among the critics.</p> <p>\u201cThe Apple case is a great illustration of the most aggressive tax planning that is out there\u2026 [It produced] massive profits that ended up going taxed nowhere. It is precisely because of these types of schemes that the G20 asked us to start looking at major tax reforms [three years ago].\u201d</p> <p>It is the OECD\u2019s work on tax reform that prompted Ireland to finally close loopholes that allowed Apple and other multinationals to use \u201cnon-tax-resident\u201d Irish companies to receive billions of dollars in income that then went untaxed. As a result, Apple unwound its use of such arrangements last year.</p> <p>It now remains to be seen whether Vestager demonstrates an appetite for going after further large sums from cash-rich US corporations that have used aggressive tax structures in Europe. She already has two suspected sweetheart deals in her sights \u2014 separate tax rulings granted by Luxembourg to McDonald\u2019s and Amazon. And she has not ruled out adding more.</p> <p>Whatever the outcome, however, Washington and Wall Street have woken up to the possibility that if America is unwilling to tax the ballooning offshore cash mountains of its leading companies, others are now emboldened to do so.</p>",
  "<p>Retail chain Marks &amp; Spencer is to cut up to 500 jobs at its head office in London as part of efforts to reduce costs.</p> <p>The store is expected to make the job cuts as early as next week following a review of the company\u2019s structure by its chief executive. <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Steve Rowe, who took control of the retailer in April, had branded the performance of its clothing and home arm \u201cunacceptable\u201d after like-for-like sales plummeted 8.9%. </p> <p>He has said he wants to trim costs at the head office so he can invest more in improving stores, prices and products for shoppers.

We would never comment on rumour and speculation and have nothing further to add.\u201d</p> <p>Rowe has vowed to improve on Marks &amp; Spencer\u2019s performance since company results in July saw the biggest drop in clothing sales for a decade. The 8.9% fall in underlying clothing and home sales in the three months to July was far bigger than analysts expected and echoed the collapse in performance felt in 2008.</p> <p>\u201cThese are not the numbers I want to see by any stretch, but they are the numbers I expected to see,\u201d Rowe said at the time. He added that the company\u2019s reliance on sales and promotions would have to be tempered if the numbers were to improve. \u201cI\u2019ve been clear: we must break this cycle because it is damaging our business,\u201d he said.</p>",

Geall said: \u201cCertainly in terms of US-China relations, it is the one area where they have created a proper, active, cooperative relationship \u2026 [There are] a lot of flights back and forward, a lot of cooperative projects on coal, on renewables, on energy-efficient buildings, on innovation. There is a lot of substance beneath the announcements that come out.</p> <p>Geall added: \u201cI do think it is part of Obama\u2019s legacy and it\u2019s surprising that it hasn\u2019t been talked about all that much in that context actually. He managed to help get something really constructive going after the failure of [<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2009/dec/18/copenhagen-deal\">the 2009 climate summit</a> in] Copenhagen.\u201d </p> <p>Geall said China\u2019s leaders, who have vowed to cut coal consumption and draw 20% of the country\u2019s energy from non-fossil fuels by 2030, also deserved praise for their commitment to cleaning up. \u201cNot only is it the one area where there is productive US-China cooperation, but it is the one area where China is actively behaving like a superpower and they are actually taking on the responsibility of having that immense weight in the emissions talks. They really have shown some leadership and that has been reflected through the UN climate process.\u201d</p> <p>Beijing\u2019s resolve was the result of a growing awareness of the dangers of pollution and climate change and how \u201cthere is a national interest in China in the low carbon transition and in being the leading suppliers of the clean technologies that we will need in a carbon-constrained world\u201d. </p> <p>Jake Schmidt of the US-based Natural Resources Defense Council said: \u201cOnly a few short years ago, countries were trying to drag the US and China into the global climate agreements and now these two countries are among the first to join the new legal regime.

Signing signals that country\u2019s support for the Paris agreement and its intention to align its domestic policies with the agreement terms and start the process of formally joining the agreement.</p> <p><strong>The second step:</strong> undertake domestic processes to formally join (or accept/approve/ratify) the agreement and \u2018consent to be bound\u2019 by its terms and deposit the appropriate paperwork with the UN Secretary-General.</p> <p><strong>The third step:</strong> the next phase starts when a sufficient number of countries (55) covering a certain percentage of emissions (55%) have formally joined the Paris agreement. When these two thresholds are met the agreement will enter into force.</p> <p>Once the conditions of the third step are met, entry into force will occur 30 days after the dual thresholds are achieved. Upon entry into force, the Agreement will become binding international law and countries that have formally joined will be subject to its provisions.

May will hold talks with world leaders including Barack Obama, Vladimir Putin and the Chinese president, Xi Jinping. But the PM is not expected to use the meeting to make an announcement on the Hinkley Point project, which is backed by Beijing\u2019s state-owned nuclear firm \u2013 fuelling speculation the plan will be scrapped or significantly altered. A UK government source told the Press Association: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We have set out the government\u2019s approach to Hinkley, we are currently considering all the component parts of that.</p> <p>We have said we will make a decision this month, that remains the plan.

Giltinan shield.</p> <p>I didn\u2019t know James personally, but with a name like either a hollywood producer or a late 19<sup>th</sup> century railway tycoon, I imagine he was a pretty cool cat.

  "<p>Kadeena Cox never thought about becoming a cyclist. Sprinting was always her thing and the 200m was where she excelled. Cox was one of the fastest able-bodied junior athletes in Britain and when thoughts of making it to Rio first entered her head, she dreamed of running on the track in the&#xa0;Olympics.</p> <p>Two years ago, however, her life changed for ever when she was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis, a neurological condition that can be exacerbated by exercise, stress and overexertion, after suffering a stroke a few months earlier. Cox\u2019s illness wrecked her chances of continuing in able-bodied sports but one of the first questions she asked her doctor was whether she would be able to compete again. Told that she could, she altered her sights to focus on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/18/paralympics-step-backwards-rio-athletes\" title=\"\">the Paralympics</a>, only to discover that she was finding it difficult to run.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/sep/02/how-does-paralympic-classification-work\">How does Paralympic classification work?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>So she sat on a bike for the first time. \u201cIt was something I could do, sitting in a stationary bike that was stable,\u201d Cox says. Soon it was clear that she had the potential to become a star on two wheels after switching to para sport, confirmation of which arrived when the 25-year-old from Leeds won the 500m time trial (C4) in the Track World Championships this year.</p> <p>\u201cThere are people who know more than me about the sport,\u201d she says. \u201cBut I\u2019ve got raw talent and passion and I\u2019m determined to win.\u201d</p> <p>What you should know about Cox is that she is stubborn. She has developed into a world-class cyclist in the space of 18 months and yet she was not willing to let go of athletics, her first love. Once she was able to return to the track, she defied the oppressive heat in Doha to win 100m (T37) gold in the World Championships and set a new world record last year. It meant too much to her and, despite the misgivings of her coaches, that is why Cox will be representing ParalympicsGB in two sports in Rio.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/sep/02/inquiry-paralympic-classification-uk-athletics\">Inquiry into UK Paralympic classification to be launched after Rio Games</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Isabel Newstead was the last British athlete to win medals in two sports in the same Paralympics, collecting discus gold and shooting bronze in Seoul in 1988, but it briefly seemed that Cox would be restricted to the 100m, 400m and 4x100m relay in athletics when she was omitted from the original cycling squad in June after undergoing classification tests. She had started out in the C2 category but was moved into the C4 category for less impaired riders, having already been moved from the T37 to T38 category in athletics. However, space was made for her in the squad last month and she will race in the 500m time trial and the road race (both C4/C5).</p> <p>Remarkably, Cox is not just looking to equal Newstead\u2019s record. There is a belief within the ParalympicsGB camp that she could win five golds, although pulling it off will require an extraordinary effort. Cox\u2019s condition means that her fatigue levels are high and recovery is crucial. \u201cWe noticed I wasn\u2019t getting enough and I was being affected in training sessions,\u201d she says. \u201cThat\u2019s the challenge of doing two sports, I guess.\u201d</p> <p>She sounds almost blas\u00e9 but her task is daunting given that the time trial is the day after the 100m final. How she recovers from the 100m will be crucial.</p> <p>It is a surprise, then, to hear that Cox is thinking about adding a third sport after the Games. \u201cI\u2019m waiting for them to bring in bobsleigh so I can do the winter Paralympics as well,\u201d she says. \u201cI would do the two-man bob.\u201d</p> <p>Her hunger is insatiable. \u201cI never wanted to give in to my condition,\u201d Cox says. \u201cMy life changed a lot but I didn\u2019t want it to change my dreams or goals. I think I had been in hospital for a couple of days when I started fundraising to get to the Games.</p> <p>\u201cInitially I wasn\u2019t able to work. I wasn\u2019t able to get to facilities as I wasn\u2019t driving at that time. I hoped that people would support me to get to this point and last year their money and support got me to be the world champion in the 100m. I\u2019m just grateful for ever to the people who believed in me because it was just one girl\u2019s dream and thousands of people are making it come true. This year I\u2019m on lottery funding, without which I wouldn\u2019t be able to afford it or take the time out of university to do the two sports. Lottery funding has been a lifesaver.\u201d</p> <p>Cox is the third eldest in a family of seven children and her parents will be supporting her in Rio. \u201cMy mum\u2019s my rock,\u201d she says. \u201cShe\u2019s not really shown any sign of letting my condition break her. It\u2019s only when I hear her do interviews that I realise how much she\u2019s struggled with it but she\u2019s been strong with me 24/7. She\u2019s put up with my tantrums and my moodiness when things aren\u2019t going my way and she\u2019s been there to pick me up.\u201d</p> <p>One problem, though. \u201cMy mum at my competitions is the most embarrassing person in the world,\u201d Cox says. \u201cShe just screams so loud. I\u2019m just like \u2018mother, please\u2019. She always videos and the video is not of me, it\u2019s of the sky or the ground because she\u2019s always jumping around. Mum is not very good at videoing or cheering.\u201d</p> <p>She had better start practising.</p>",
  "<p>The sharp decline in the number of working-class Labour MPs has caused a slump in support among voters with similar backgrounds, according to research that seeks to explain why support has dwindled in the party\u2019s heartlands.<br></p> <p>The study says previous leaders such as Neil Kinnock and Tony Blair made a concerted effort to select \u201cmore and more middle-class candidates to run for office during the 1980s and 1990s as part of an effort to rebrand,\u201d resulting in success at the ballot box.</p> <p>But it claims that the \u201cconscious electoral strategy\u201d stored up intractable problems for Labour, as working-class voters, who initially simply didn\u2019t vote in response, are now seeking an alternative.</p> <p>\u201cWorking-class people are much more likely than middle-class people to vote Labour when the party contains a substantial number of working-class MPs, and variation over time in the number of working-class Labour MPs closely tracks the strength of such class voting,\u201d wrote Oliver Heath, an academic at Royal Holloway, University of London, who wrote the paper.<br></p> <p>He said <a href=\"https://pure.royalholloway.ac.uk/portal/en/publications/a-growing-class-divide-mps-and-voters(4f318307-6ddf-46f9-85ef-9e294b438407).html\">the study</a>, which is revealed in a <a href=\"https://www.bitebackpublishing.com/books/more-sex-lies-and-the-ballot-box\">new book</a>, More Sex, Lies and the Ballot Box, showed that even when other factors were controlled the number of MPs from poorer backgrounds had an effect.</p> <p>The fact that 37% of Labour MPs came from a manual occupational background in 1964 but just 7% did in 2015 had harmed the party\u2019s image among its traditional voters, he added.</p> <p>\u201cWhat the research showed was that as Labour candidates became more middle class, many working-class people simply stopped voting. For the last 20 or 30 years we have had a picture of gradually growing working-class abstention,\u201d he said, arguing that people felt Labour was no longer representing them.</p> <p>\u201cThey became alienated from the political process \u2013 and that went unnoticed for quite some time. But these alienated voters are fertile territory for being remobilised,\u201d he added, saying that is why they were drawn to Ukip and then \u2013 more clearly \u2013 the vote for Brexit.</p> <p>\u201cIt is very difficult for Labour to rebuild the connection in a credible way. The party needs to reassess what its social identity is \u2013 who it wants to represent: the disaffected working-class voters in the north or the more liberal middle classes. I think it was easier when it had a strong identity at the core.\u201d</p> <p>Heath said the original shift away from poorer candidates was started by Kinnock as part of an effort to break links with the unions, and disassociate with working-class radicalism.</p> <p>His research found that the problem was most acute with wealthy candidates, finding that they tended to \u201cparticularly repel\u201d the working classes, because they were not seen as approachable.</p> <p>\u201cMPs from privileged backgrounds are indeed perceived as less \u2018in touch\u2019 by working-class voters, who will regard a pledge to stand up for the underprivileged as more credible coming from someone whose own background is modest than a similar promise coming from the child of millionaires,\u201d he wrote in the report. </p> <p>Heath called for action, arguing that political parties had rightly tried hard to increase the representation of women, ethnic minorities and young people in Westminster. \u201cBut the representation of those groups has been growing over time, while the representation of working-class MPs has been falling,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Jonathan Ashworth, a shadow cabinet member who represents Leicester South, said: \u201cThis is a problem for politics across the piste, but the Labour party needs to increase its efforts to find candidates who come from the communities we want to represent. That is more working-class, female and more black and ethnic minority candidates.\u201d</p> <p>But the MP said it was a more complicated issue than was sometimes made out, with MPs like himself or Gloria De Piero, who were brought up in working-class families, but ended up in typically middle-class jobs.</p> <p>\u201cMy mum was a barmaid in Manchester nightclubs, and my dad a croupier in a Salford casino. We were working-class but I went to university and beat the socioeconomic indicators and ended up working for Gordon Brown and becoming an MP. So where do I fall in these statistics?\u201d</p>",

Actually, this might yet turn out to be Sorrentino\u2019s Twin Peaks.</p> <p>Law plays Lenny Belardo, a conservative American cardinal who becomes the first American Pope in history, and styles himself Pius XIII, an unlucky handle which some associate with Papal support for Mussolini.</p> <p>Lenny\u2019s victory was the result of botched Machiavellian intrigue from his mentor, Cardinal Michael Spencer (James Cromwell) - a character perhaps inspired by the formidable Vatican bank president Archbishop Paul Marcinkus - who had himself wanted to become Pope. On gaining office, the impassively and handsomely smiling young Pope reverses a Vatican smoking ban introduced by his predecessor John Paul II \u2013 but only for himself. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fe37a08f96c83efe61271213e3a06b078e141634\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fe37a08f96c83efe61271213e3a06b078e141634/0_66_4091_2455/1000.jpg\" alt=\"set of \u201cThe young Pope\u201d by Paolo Sorrentino. 09/01/2015 sc.224 - ep 2 in the picture James Cromwell.

As in The Great Beauty, there is a great reverence for Rome and the papal mysteries of Romanit\u00e0. As in his previous movie, Youth \u2013 on which this is a great improvement \u2013 there is a dazzling dream sequence involving Venice, a city with painful, personal associations for the young Pope. Sometimes, Sorrentino\u2019s English-language work has looked uncertain, but the concept of an English-speaking Pope to whom Italian Cardinals must speak English gives Sorrentino a link back to his home turf.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/video/2016/sep/03/jude-law-the-young-pope-extended-trailer-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/5xn2v\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2693709\"            data-video-name=\"Jude Law in The Young Pope: watch the exclusive trailer \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"Sky\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-57c9b6fbe4b0456abb93d6f4\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/09/02/160902youngpope_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/09/02/160902youngpope.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/09/02/160902youngpope_WebM.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/video/2016/sep/03/jude-law-the-young-pope-extended-trailer-video\">Jude Law in The Young Pope: watch the exclusive trailer</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>The tone is set at the very beginning with a troubling, hallucinatory image of Lenny crawling out from under a pile of sleeping babies.

  "<p>The decision by China and the US, the world\u2019s two biggest greenhouse gas emitters, to ratify the landmark Paris accord on climate change heralds a new era of global cooperation on limiting emissions.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/dec/09/durban-climate-change-connie-hedegaard\">Only a few years ago</a>, such a commitment looked like a pipe dream.

Making this work in practice will take much more.</p> <p>First is the task of getting more nations to ratify. The US and China make up about 39% of global emissions. Under the foundation treaty, <a href=\"http://newsroom.unfccc.int/\">the 1992 UN Framework Convention on Climate Change</a>, at least 55 countries must ratify for the agreement to enter force, and countries accounting for at least 55% of global greenhouse gas emissions must be represented.</p> <p>With China, the US and a host of smaller countries <a href=\"http://unfccc.int/paris_agreement/items/9444.php\">signed up</a>, the biggest emitter left outstanding is the EU, which negotiated the agreement as a bloc. The EU is unlikely to be able to ratify the accord any time soon, because of the mechanics of getting legal surety from its 28 member states.</p> <p>There is a way around this. Nicholas Stern, chairman of the Grantham Institute on Climate Change and author of the landmark 2006 report on the economics of climate change, called on EU member states and the UK to ratify the agreement individually, through their national parliaments, to speed up the process. EU members are legally parties to the accord at a national as well as a bloc level, so if enough major countries \u2013 including the UK and Germany \u2013 were to enact the necessary processes then the accord could pass the final hurdle.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/sep/03/breakthrough-us-china-agree-ratify-paris-climate-change-deal\">Breakthrough as US and China agree to ratify Paris climate change deal</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cThis is a tremendous opportunity,\u201d Stern told the Guardian. \u201cIt\u2019s very important for the credibility of the process [of gaining global agreement on climate action through the UN] to get the treaty ratified this year. EU countries can and should ratify as soon as possible. It\u2019s not sensible to hold back, when they could make a big difference.\u201d</p> <p>The second, and more important, problem is that the agreement itself \u2013 the first that is both legally binding and likely to cover all countries \u2013 is just the beginning. The document, reached at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/dec/13/paris-climate-deal-cop-diplomacy-developing-united-nations\">a historic conference last December</a> after 20 years of tortuous stop-start talks, commits countries to holding global warming to no more than 2C above pre-industrial levels, which scientists regard as the limit of safety, beyond which climate change is likely to have catastrophic and irreversible effects.</p> <p>It does not specify what actions countries must take. Nearly all signatories set out targets on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/dec/12/paris-climate-deal-200-nations-sign-finish-fossil-fuel-era\">cutting their future greenhouse gas emissions beyond 2020</a>, when current commitments expire. But the cuts in carbon dioxide implied by those targets will not be enough to hold to the 2C threshold, let alone limit the world to <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/dec/12/paris-climate-deal-key-points\">the 1.5C of warming included as an \u201caspiration\u201d and required to save the globe\u2019s most low-lying areas</a>. </p> <p>In addition, though the framework is legally binding, the commitments on emissions are not. National governments will be relied upon to flesh out their targets themselves, through policies that could be controversial and perhaps expensive in the short term, such as pursuing renewable energy and leaving fossil fuels unexploited. That process has barely begun for many.</p> <p>Green campaigners called on national governments to act urgently both to fulfil the legal pledges of the Paris accord, and the moral promises made to their people to halt dangerous climate change.</p> <p>Li Shuo, senior policy advisor for east Asia at <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.greenpeace.org.uk/\">Greenpeace</a>, said: \u201cPolitical ambition must keep up with rising sea levels faced by vulnerable communities. Touting the Paris \u2018triumph\u2019 while handing out money to the fossil fuel industry is simply not compatible with the Paris agreement. Governments must <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/series/keep-it-in-the-ground\">keep coal, oil and gas in the ground</a>, and urgently focus on a just transition to renewables. The G20 meeting must be the moment when leaders lay out a timetable for eliminating fossil fuel subsidies, a practice which the Paris agreement has made all the more hypocritical.\u201d</p> <p>Mike Childs, head of policy at <a href=\"http://www.foei.org/\">Friends of the Earth</a>, added: \u201cCountries need to commit to even deeper cuts than they promised in Paris and they need to enact policies to turn warm words into meaningful action.\u201d</p> <p>Early ratification would give governments the spur needed to formulate new policies on limiting carbon, and give businesses a clear signal that they should invest in reducing their impact on the climate, said Nick Mabey, chief executive of the E3G thinktank. \u201c[The US and China announcement] sends a strong signal to investors and businesses that they can continue investing on the assumption that the Paris [commitments] will be delivered,\u201d he told the Guardian. \u201cAt a time of increasing geopolitical turbulence this sends a welcome signal that cooperation to tackling climate change is resilient to worsening relations among the world\u2019s superpowers.\u201d</p> <p>Jake Schmidt, director at the US-based Natural Resources Defense Council, added that other governments must take note. \u201cThe US and China are sending a powerful signal to other countries that the time for action is now,\u201d he said. \u201cIt shows to countries and investors that the world\u2019s two largest economies and biggest polluters are preparing to help lead the shift to a low-carbon economy. Only a few short years ago, countries were trying to drag the US and China into the global climate agreements, and now these two are among the first to join the new legal regime. That is an important shift, which reflects the reality that countries now realise acting on climate change is in their own self-interest and failing to act is no longer a smart choice.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/jun/25/eu-out-vote-puts-uk-commitment-to-paris-climate-agreement-in-doubt\">The UK\u2019s position</a>, as the government negotiates exit from the EU, is of particular concern, as UK support over the course of more than two decades of UN climate negotiations has been a key influence. </p> <p>Childs told the Guardian that the prime minister should not delay, saying: \u201cIt\u2019s up to Theresa May to make sure that the UK ratifies the agreement too, and quickly.

But the ACA relies on competition between insurers to provide affordable coverage, and that is dwindling.</p> <p>Under the ACA, health insurance marketplaces, also called health exchanges, were set up to facilitate the purchase of health insurance in each state. Customers are free to choose from a set of standardized healthcare plans from participating insurers, and those policies are eligible for federal subsidies.</p> <p>But insurers have been fleeing the exchanges, arguing that they are loss makers and the types of people attracted to them make the risks too great for the insurers  to provide affordable (and profitable) policies.</p> <p>David Howard, an associate professor at Emory University\u2019s department of health policy and management, said the ACA included provisions to keep the marketplaces stable, but some of those were watered down in the push to get the deal through Congress, and in other cases the provisions have not been enacted in the way people expected. \u201cSo that means the exchanges are potentially on the cusp of falling apart,\u201d Howard said. <br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/mar/11/the-perils-of-turning-26-when-us-millennials-lose-their-parents-healthcare-cover\">The perils of turning 26: when US millennials lose their parents' healthcare</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The marketplaces are unstable in part because they are new, and all the parties involved \u2013 from insurers to those who need insurance \u2013 are trying to figure out where they fit into the equation.

  "<p>Here in America, Labor Day weekend is upon us \u2013 an occasion meant to honor the wage slaves and the clock punchers, but more practically is a signpost declaring the end of summer frolics and the beginning of the slow, frigid descent into fall and winter. </p> <p>Unless, like me, you live in Los Angeles, a place where seasons are subtle, rain and snow are practically alien concepts and it doesn\u2019t start to dip below 70F until after Halloween.

Pumpkin spice, of course. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/oct/01/why-orange-food-is-disgusting-pumpkins-carrots\">Orange is the new yuck: why autumn foods make me sick</a> </p> </aside>  <p>On a recent road trip down the coast, I stopped in a Starbucks in San Diego to see if they were serving their most popular seasonal beverage, the pumpkin spice latte.

I could have some rubbish fizzy tea or an industrial-grade sandwich that tastes like it was warmed up with the Death Star laser, but no pumpkin spice. </p> <p>As such, my mind says it\u2019s not fall yet. It\u2019s still the fiery purgatory that exists between boiling hot summer and slightly less hot autumn. The introduction of pumpkin-flavored items \u2013 and then peppermint and eggnog in time for Christmas \u2013 is all I have to trigger the senses to note that it is a different time of year.

You might as well melt a bag of confectioner\u2019s sugar and drink that with a Twizzlers straw. The main reason to drink coffee is to consume enough caffeine to survive another 24 hours of personal and professional malaise. It\u2019s unclear that PSLs even have any coffee in them. </p> <p>Every coffee shop has to serve seasonal drinks, though. People love them, either because of the novelty of a weird flavor (like the monsters who eagerly consume biscuits and gravy-flavored potato chips as though that\u2019s not the most heinous idea humanity has devised since the mail-order bride) or the scarcity. I am guilty of driving past a McDonald\u2019s once a year and exclaiming to no one in particular, \u201cOh, the McRib is back.\u201d </p> <p>Who cares? I don\u2019t even eat at McDonald\u2019s \u2013 not because I\u2019m too good for fast food, but just because I don\u2019t like it. But if you tell me some processed shit sandwich smothered in brown sugar sauce is back \u201cfor a limited time only,\u201d well, I just have to have at least one. You know, because it\u2019s special.<br></p> <p>That brings me back to the passage of time: the rarity of things \u2013 the emotions they evoke when we can enjoy them \u2013 are sometimes all we have to experience pleasure at the flipping of the calendar. </p> <p>Birthdays are the cocking of an invisible gun called mortality that\u2019s about to go off at any moment. Holidays like Christmas and Thanksgiving are fun for some, but they\u2019re generally a passive-aggressive mind-crime committed by your lunatic family. What else is there, if not coffee? </p> <p>It might not taste good. It might be woefully terrible for your health. But at least it doesn\u2019t make you feel bad about gaining weight or pester you about when you\u2019re having kids. It tells you that time has passed, but without including the fact that now you\u2019re bald or you have a mortgage that you might never pay off. It\u2019s just a drink. It serves a purpose, and a not inconsequential one \u2013 it reminds you that you\u2019re alive. Still. Inexplicably. You made it. It\u2019s pumpkin spice season.</p>",

  "<p>The Yarrow looks unremarkable. OK, the building is Grade II-listed and has an interesting history: it was built in 1894 as a convalescent home for children, by shipbuilder Sir Alfred Yarrow, who declared Broadstairs the healthiest place in Britain. But heritage buildings are turned into hotels every five minutes; we don\u2019t seem to know what else to do with them. On the inside, too, it ticks the boutique boxes without much wow factor.</p> <p>But appearances can be deceiving. This hotel is the only one in the country owned by a further education college and run by its students. What a brilliant idea by East Kent College! Why farm out students for work experience when they can graft right on campus, and bring in a few quid? After years of cuts, cash-strapped colleges need all the help they can get (though the government\u2019s Skills Funding Agency did chip in for the \u00a311m refurb).</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6539d70a34c40236b4fe4a268b5ddc5a6d0b24bd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6539d70a34c40236b4fe4a268b5ddc5a6d0b24bd/0_495_7360_4417/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Student in Yarrow kitchen\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>As well as a hotel, the Yarrow is a restaurant, salon and spa, so catering, hair and beauty students can learn on the job, too. About 70 students work here each year, first on unpaid work experience and then as paid apprentices. Some will go on to full-time jobs at the hotel. A handful of former students are already working in the kitchen and front-of-house, overseen by fully trained staff. Executive chef Ben Williams, for example, used to work at two-Michelin-starred The Square in London.</p> <p>At check-in, we didn\u2019t notice anything out of the ordinary. At dinner, though, it was obvious who was a pro and who wasn\u2019t. Waiting staff were flustered and overattentive. We were asked more than once for our drinks order, and repeatedly whether our food was OK. When a young waiter arrived with some \u201cpre-starters\u201d and I asked what they were, he turned bright red, blurted \u201cI don\u2019t know\u201d and practically ran away. They were clearly nervous and doing their best \u2013 far nicer than being ignored by complacent or too-cool-for-school staff.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7ce475edb8b52797476348943f0ec2945a433386\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7ce475edb8b52797476348943f0ec2945a433386/0_472_7086_4252/1000.jpg\" alt=\"One of the junior suites at The Yarrow hotel, Broadstairs\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">One of the hotel\u2019s junior suites</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jason Dodd</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The food was good, occasionally verging on great. Those pre-starters were a nice touch (cheese beignets, mushroom crostini and a gorgeous vichyssoise, for the benefit of my waiter). The main-course Kentish lamb was very pink, with deep green broad beans and bright green pea puree, and the beef fillet came with fancy-sounding oxtail croustillant. These turned out to be meat-stuffed mini yorkies \u2013 delicious. The dessert was even better, an eggy sponge with plump, boozy cherries, a lemon curd-filled sugar cigar and vanilla ice-cream. We paired it with a glass of Chapel Down Nectar, a lovely light, sweet wine from Kent \u2013 the wine list is strong on local vineyards, and the food menu changes every few weeks.</p> <p>Even after a huge meal, the climb up to our room was surprisingly easy: the oak staircase is the original, with small steps for little feet. This was an added bonus as my friend was recovering from open-heart surgery \u2013 a place where children, and later soldiers, had convalesced seemed a fitting place for his first outing. (Coincidentally, he is also an FE lecturer, and quizzed the poor students endlessly.)</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"09d416f46f43073418f935458a3ac041b08969d1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/09d416f46f43073418f935458a3ac041b08969d1/0_1628_4912_2947/1000.jpg\" alt=\"HOT CANAPES\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Our room, one of five suites (there are also 23 double/twin rooms) was quite plain, but high ceilings and windows, and a coastal colour scheme of pale blue, white and cream, gave it an airy feel. A cast-iron fireplace and a half-staircase up to the bathroom, which had a rolltop bath and separate shower, were nice features. Some rooms have sea views.</p> <p>In the morning, I tried out the spa, which has treatments by junior therapists (massage from \u00a312, manicure from \u00a36). My masseuse was a former beauty student, now working full-time at the hotel; another success for the scheme. Breakfast meant the same overzealous table service and some truly terrible coffee, but again we gave them full marks for effort.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7df02afb15ab3be5370f8a45b3487aac3e8fef34\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7df02afb15ab3be5370f8a45b3487aac3e8fef34/0_0_7108_4265/1000.jpg\" alt=\"SOLARIUM\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>The hotel hasn\u2019t entirely shaken off its institutional feel.

She also stated she received no particular guidance as to how she should use the president\u2019s email address.</p> <p>In addition, the notes say: \u201cClinton could not recall when she first received her security clearance and if she carried it with her to state via reciprocity from her time in the Senate. Clinton could not recall any briefing or training by state related to the retention of federal records or handling of classified information.\u201d</p> <p>Clinton was aware she was an original classification authority at the state department, but again \u201ccould not recall how often she used this authority or any training or guidance provided by state.

In his response, Powell told Clinton that if it became \u201cpublic\u201d that she was using a BlackBerry to \u201cdo business\u201d, the emails could become \u201cofficial records[s] and subject to the law\u201d.<br></p> <p>Powell wrote: \u201cBe very careful. I got around it all by not saying much and not using systems that captured the data.\u201d</p> <p>Clinton told the FBI she understood Powell\u2019s comments to mean that any of her work-related communications would be records of the government and \u201cdid not factor\u201d the comments \u201cinto her decision to use a personal email account\u201d, the documents say.</p> <p>The release also includes technical details about how the server in the basement of Clinton\u2019s home in Chappaqua, New York, was set up. </p> <p>Clinton\u2019s critics seized on the latest revelations. Trump\u2019s full statement read: \u201cHillary Clinton\u2019s answers to the FBI about her private email server defy belief. I was absolutely shocked to see that her answers to the FBI stood in direct contradiction to what she told the American people. After reading these documents, I really don\u2019t understand how she was able to get away from prosecution.\u201d</p> <p>Jason Miller, senior communications adviser to Trump, said: \u201cHillary Clinton is applying for a job that begins each day with a top secret intelligence briefing, and the notes from her FBI interview reinforce her tremendously bad judgment and dishonesty.<br></p> <p>\u201cClinton\u2019s secret email server was an end run around government transparency laws that wound up jeopardizing our national security and sensitive diplomatic efforts.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/02/hillary-clinton-wellesley-college-freshmen-women\">Where Hillary called home: Wellesley\u2019s 2020 class on its most famous alumnus</a> </p> </aside>  <p>He added: \u201cClinton\u2019s reckless conduct and dishonest attempts to avoid accountability show she cannot be trusted with the presidency and its chief obligation as commander-in-chief of the US armed forces.\u201d </p> <p>The House speaker, Paul Ryan, said: \u201cThese documents demonstrate Hillary Clinton\u2019s reckless and downright dangerous handling of classified information during her tenure as secretary of state.

This is exactly why I have called for her to be denied access to classified information.\u201d</p> <p>Reince Priebus, chair of the Republican National Committee, said: \u201cThe FBI\u2019s summary of their interview with Hillary Clinton is a devastating indictment of her judgment, honesty and basic competency. Clinton\u2019s answers either show she is completely incompetent or blatantly lied to the FBI or the public. </p> <p>\u201cEither way it\u2019s clear that, through her own actions, she has disqualified herself from the presidency.\u201d</p> <p>The Clinton campaign insisted that it was pleased the notes had been made public.

I know that sounds daft but it was more about the attitude the players took on to the field. We decided we\u2019d worked very hard to get into the Premiership and weren\u2019t going to waste a year feeling miserable and sorry for ourselves. We just said we were going to enjoy it; every game we played we tried to win. There wasn\u2019t one when we went out seeing if we could scrap for a losing bonus point.\u201d</p> <p>It is positive advice Bristol would do well to heed. Happily they have some promising young assistant coaches in the former Wales internationals Dwayne Peel and Jonathan Thomas, while the forwards coach, Mark Bakewell, is among the best around. Bakewell, a Kiwi who played and coached in Australia for years and has also worked with Bath, Brive, B\u00e9ziers, Suntory and Tonga, has no illusions about the challenge ahead. \u201cIn a lot of ways the Premiership is the toughest competition in the world and you\u2019ve got to treat it as such. If not you\u2019ll get burnt,\u201d he says.</p> <p>\u201cFrom a psychological point of view you\u2019ve got to be very strong. There\u2019s a battle to win the trophy, there\u2019s the battle to make the semi-finals, there\u2019s the battle to qualify for Europe and there\u2019s the relegation battle. Every team is in a battle. There\u2019s not many competitions like that around the world. That\u2019s one of the reasons why it is so attritional, which has positives and negatives attached. Even subconsciously it\u2019s restrictive.\u201d</p> <p>For that reason Bakewell reckons Sale are a useful initial model: a big pack, a good set piece and a good home record. Bristol will have to improve markedly on their nervous home display against Doncaster in the play-off final second leg \u2013 they lost 34-32 but were promoted 60-47 on aggregate \u2013 to stop this month\u2019s muscular visitors, Northampton, Exeter and Saracens, but Bakewell is braced for the long haul.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/27/rob-baxter-exeter-new-premiership-season\">Rob Baxter: Exeter\u2019s foundations are strong for new Premiership season</a> </p> </aside>  <p>History, he emphasises, will count for little: \u201cAfter seven years people still believe Bristol deserve to be in the Premiership. I firmly believe you don\u2019t deserve anything unless you earn it and you only earn it if you win on the scoreboard.\u201d</p> <p>Potential high-class reinforcements are on the way, with Booy revealing a couple of signings are in the pipeline: \u201cWe think we\u2019ve got one but we can\u2019t announce that yet. We\u2019re also hoping to get another.\u201d The former will be a southern hemisphere back, the latter a forward; stick them in alongside Jack Lam and Soane Tonga\u2019uiha and any hint of a soft Bristolian underbelly will swiftly disappear.</p> <p>There is also another key date inked into Booy\u2019s diary. On 18 November, Bristol will visit their nearest rivals Bath in a game awash with irony. Not so long ago it was Craig\u2019s millions that threatened to transform the West Country landscape. How sweet would it be for Bristol to bridge the modern Avon divide? \u201cWe\u2019re playing them on my birthday so the boys clearly understand what they\u2019ve got to do,\u201d chuckles the 63-year-old. \u201cThere\u2019s only one present I want.\u201d</p> <p>It would also soothe his continuing anger at the \u201cunfair system\u201d that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2015/may/28/worcester-bristol-rugby-play-off-injustices-dean-ryan\" title=\"\">denied Bristol automatic promotion until now despite them topping the Championship</a> table for five seasons out of seven.</p> <p>The immediate priority, though, is Quins. It is a long time \u2013 1988 to be precise \u2013 since the same clubs met in a Twickenham Cup final and even longer since evocative Bristolian names such as Mike Rafter, Dave Rollitt, John Pullin, Alan Morley, Richard Harding and Bob Hesford made their England debuts.

And there\u2019s persuasive evidence that, <a href=\"http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/plant-based-diets\">compared to a solely plant-based diet, eating meat shortens life</a> and makes people sicker and fatter.</p> <p>Against this background, the NHS allows fast food chains in its hospitals. Patient <a href=\"http://www.pat.nhs.uk/patients-and-visitors/Catering/Menu%20-%20North%20Manchester.pdf\">menus</a> offer a wide selection of meats every day. And creamed potatoes, beef casserole and sweet chilli pork and rice are recommended \u201chealthier choices\u201d. Patients can tuck into disease-promoting animal flesh, but do not enjoy unrestricted hedonism. Meat eaters who enjoy a relaxing cigarette after dinner are prevented from doing so, apparently in their own and others\u2019 best interests, thanks to a blanket ban on smoking.</p> <p>But how can the NHS sensibly ban cigarettes as a known health hazard while simultaneously promoting meat? To endorse one known danger while completely banning a similar one makes no sense. Either it\u2019s OK to allow free choice or it\u2019s OK to prevent \u201cunhealthy behaviours\u201d, but you can\u2019t have it both ways. If you ban smoking you have to ban meat, which causes considerably more damage to animals, the environment and individuals than smoking. If you don\u2019t ban meat, then you can\u2019t ban smoking. Which is it to be? George Orwell coined the idea of doublethink in his dystopian novel Nineteen Eighty-Four<strong> </strong> to highlight the troubling phenomenon where we simultaneously accept mutually contradictory beliefs as true, blissfully unaware there\u2019s any conflict.</p> <p>In doublethink we fail to notice even the most stunning inconsistencies. Most people like to think of themselves as animal lovers \u2013 in the UK for example about half of all households keep pets \u2013 yet it\u2019s estimated that only 2%\u201310% of the UK population is vegetarian (will eat dairy and eggs) and less than 1% is vegan (will not eat or use any animal matter). So it seems that at least 50 million British animal lovers are happy to eat them, which is surely more than a little weird.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/healthcare-network/2016/aug/18/governments-response-obesity-diabetes-nhs\">The government's response to obesity and diabetes is insulting</a> </p> </aside>  <p> We\u2019ve all seen people putting money in animal charity collection boxes with one hand, while eating a beef burger with the other. But even staring absurdity in the face, most of us don\u2019t notice a problem. We only see it once we\u2019re ready to. Until then we flick it away: \u201cpets are different\u201d, \u201cpigs are meant to be eaten\u201d, \u201cwe have to have our iron\u201d, \u201call farmed animals are treated well\u201d, \u201cyou can slaughter animals humanely\u201d, and so on. </p> <p>We are plagued by doublethink because we habitually separate the world into unrelated packets. Smoking is a health issue. Meat is normal. Alcohol is bad. Not allowing tobacco products to be displayed is health promotion. Allowing body parts of slaughtered animals on public view in supermarkets is wholesome. Illogical beliefs appear compatible if their true connections are disguised. Smoking is tightly wrapped in a packet labelled \u201cVery bad for your health\u201d, whereas eating meat is in a quite different packet called \u201ca balanced diet\u201d or \u201cyou need your protein\u201d. So long as we see the world in disconnected chunks, we can avoid serious thought, and preserve the status quo. We need more opportunity to think deeply for ourselves.

  "<h2>Kotor<strong>,</strong> Montenegro</h2> <p>The Montenegrin coast feels very different from neighbouring Croatia: it\u2019s more Russian-influenced and beauty spots can be thick with jetskis, large black 4x4s, and beach bling. But Kotor, served by Tivat airport, is a gorgeous spot on a huge fjord-like sea inlet. For a good panorama, climb up to the castle, built by the Venetians (again), who ruled for almost four centuries and left an old town that is a Unesco world heritage site of labyrinthine lanes and piazzas, the 12th-century St Tryphon cathedral and city walls.

Either way, on a warm evening, sipping a crisp local wine in a delightful open-air cafe in a quaint cobbled street near the amphitheatre, I hear no foreign voices, only Bulgarian. It has to be said that on lists of European destination gems, the non-appearance of this central-southern Bulgarian city must rank as the most egregious. It should be a top-ranking, must-go, bucket-list stalwart. And what is more, almost every empire in history thought so, too.</p> <p>Plovdiv has been Greek, Goth, Hun, Viking, crusader and Ottoman, among others. It was 4,000 years old when the Romans got here, slapping a gorgeous amphitheatre in a prime location, plus an aqueduct, an odeon and a stadium which now, by dint of some remarkable engineering, does a semi-subterranean cameo appearance in the city\u2019s main shopping thoroughfare. More recently the voluptuous 19th-century merchant\u2019s houses have made fine museums (check out the <a href=\"http://www.ethnograph.info/front/index.php?lng=en\">Ethnographic </a>and the <a href=\"http://historymuseumplovdiv.org/front/index.php?lng=en%3E\">Regional History</a> museums). But the real joy is the easygoing charm of the place and the idiosyncracies: street art, curious cats, laughter from high windows and snatches of music. There is also a gem of a boutique hotel, the <a href=\"http://www.hebros-hotel.com/\">Hebros</a> (doubles from \u20ac99 B&amp;B), and several fine restaurants, including local favourite Grazhdanski Klubb (Stoyan Chalukov 1), next to Vazrazdane Gallery.

Surely a city that spent almost 50 years plunged in a grim isolationism more severe than Pyongyang must be dour and depressing. But it\u2019s not. Tirana burst from its commie cocoon in 1992 all guns blazing and is now a chaotic good-natured riot. Ottoman, Italian, Islamic, Stalinist and capitalist influences are all thrown together in an architectural pot luck, spiced up after the millennium when many apartment blocks were painted in bright colours. As a result the city can resemble a box of liquorice allsorts casually scattered at the feet of forested Mount Datji (good for hiking). The heart of the nightlife is <em>Bllocku</em> (the Block), an area formerly reserved for high-ranking party officials, now a fast-changing and ebullient enclave of restaurants and bars. This conveniently allows a bit of communist-nostalgia sightseeing to be combined with local food and drink: the coffee is excellent and don\u2019t miss the street specials, stuffed filo <em>byrek </em>and kebab-like <em>souvlak. </em>And few will want to miss a traditional breakfast of <em>pa\u00e7e koke</em>, sheep\u2019s head soup.

What these visitors are missing is a fascinating historic centre with a pleasant laid-back atmosphere and some great cafes and restaurants. The one must-see is the museum on the site of the old harbour where an entire Roman fleet sank. It is being excavated and has a collection of ships\u2019 remains and artefacts, plus relics of other cultures and an expos\u00e9 of Nazi war crimes in the area.

The side streets off Corso Umberto are the place to find authentic local cuisine like <em>zuppa gallurese </em>which is not a soup but a sloppy lasagne-like dish of layers of bread and cheese in tasty broth.

  "<p>I\u2019m standing on the edge of a one-horse town in the middle of nowhere, blinded by the mid-morning sun. Nothing to the left of me, nothing to the right. Just heat and dust. Ennio Morricone\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFa1-kciCb4\">theme tune to The Good, The Bad And The Ugly</a> plays on a loop in my head. Eventually, a man hollers and strides over. He is wearing shorts and shades, and has a salt-and-pepper beard. He could be a reclusive former pop star, who walked away from fame and gave up on the niceties of life.</p> <p>\u201cI think you\u2019re the first Brit ever to come to Olmedo,\u201d <a href=\"http://\">Nick Clegg</a> says, forgetting he is one himself. \u201cAnd I hope you\u2019re the last.\u201d Silence. He apologises; he doesn\u2019t mean it like that. It\u2019s just that he values his privacy, and this town 150km from Madrid is where Clegg\u2019s wife, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/miriam-gonzalez-durantez\">Miriam Gonz\u00e1lez Dur\u00e1ntez</a>, grew up, and where they come every summer with their three boys to stay with her mother. A sanctuary.</p> <p>He takes me on a brief tour. From the bridge, we can see sugar beet fields in the distance; here is the only hotel, there the town hall. Here is the church where he and Miriam got married, there the bust of his father-in-law, the first democratically elected mayor of Olmedo (though he was also in office under Franco). We continue walking. I wonder if we are heading towards the family home, but we end up at a cafe. Clegg orders two milky coffees in Spanish. \u201cYou\u2019re not hungry, are you?\u201d he asks. But it\u2019s more a statement than a question.</p> <p>Few have experienced the extremes of political fortune quite like Nick Clegg. In 2010, there was no politician in the land as popular as the then leader of the Liberal Democrats. He appeared so much fresher than David Cameron and Gordon Brown <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2010/apr/15/leaders-debate-nick-clegg-tv\">in the televised election debates</a>. He answered directly, remembered the names of people who asked questions, and promised change. He represented the radical centre that, given half a chance, would introduce proportional representation, elect the House of Lords, save the planet. The young loved him, not least because of one crucial pledge: the Lib Dems would not increase university tuition fees. Five years before Corbynism, there was Cleggmania, and it was just as giddy.</p> <p>Perhaps it was easy for Clegg to make his promises: after all, the Lib Dems were never held accountable because they never won general elections. Only, this time, they grabbed 57 seats and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/liberal-conservative-coalition\">formed Britain\u2019s first coalition government</a> since <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Churchill_war_ministry\">Churchill\u2019s war ministry</a> in the 1940s. Cameron was more than willing to work with the Lib Dems \u2013 he was desperate to: Clegg gave him the numbers and provided likability. But six years is an eternity in politics. The deputy prime minister became better known as Calamity Clegg, Cameron\u2019s puppet, the ultimate political Judas.</p> <p>Clegg has just written a political memoir, baldly called <a href=\"http://bookshop.theguardian.com/politics-419192.html\">Politics</a>. We are spoilt for choice when it comes to personal nadir: there\u2019s the 2014 poll that reveals <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/nick-clegg/10867964/Nick-Clegg-voted-least-popular-party-leader-in-modern-British-history.html\">he is the least popular leader in modern British history</a>; the occasion when his security guards told him to lie flat in his car to hide from protesters; <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/general-election-2015\">the 2015 election</a>, when the Lib Dems lost all but eight of their seats; and, my personal favourite, his then nine-year-old son Alberto walking around the supermarket singing the spoof song I\u2019m Sorry, based on the apology his father issued after the coalition tripled tuition fees.</p> <p>How did Alberto come to be singing it in a supermarket? \u201cI can\u2019t remember! This is\u2026 four years ago! It\u2019s a very catchy tune.\u201d Clegg laughs through gritted teeth. Remind me how the song goes, I say. \u201cI\u2019m not going to sing the bloody song. We were in quite a crowded supermarket in Putney, and he just started singing it. I quickly gave him some sweets and he stopped \u2013 they weren\u2019t gobstoppers, but they had the same effect.\u201d</p> <p>Was Alberto the only one of his three boys who sang it? \u201cI don\u2019t quite know what the relevance of this is.\u201d His voice rises. Well, I say, it\u2019s in your book. \u201cHave the other kids ever sung it? Yes, of course.\u201d Has Miriam? Now his voice rises to an incredulous squeak. \u201cI don\u2019t know, Simon!\u201d Well, I say, if ever a song was written taking the piss out of me, I\u2019m sure my whole family would sing it loud and proud. He relaxes. \u201cExactly! <em>Exaaaactly</em>! So they all sang it. Whether Miriam sang it as well\u2026 I\u2019m sure she hummed along.\u201d He pauses. \u201cI\u2019m bristling because there was a lot of piss-taking, obviously.\u201d</p> <p>He\u2019s not wrong there. It\u2019s only now, a year on and since <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2016/jun/24/david-camerons-full-resignation-speech-i-will-go-before-the-autumn-video\">Cameron\u2019s resignation</a>, that Clegg\u2019s legacy is beginning to be reassessed. Perhaps he was a moderating influence on the Tories, after all. Perhaps we didn\u2019t give him the credit he deserved. That\u2019s what he claims in his book, at any rate. An examination of the nature of coalition and liberalism, it is also a rage against the populism of the Brexiteers and Corbyn and, more than anything, a defence of his five years holding Cameron\u2019s hand \u2013 and occasionally slapping it.</p> <p>Why write it? \u201cThe turbulence in politics right now is so great, and accelerating at such a pace, that I wanted to have a stab at understanding what\u2019s going on. And, crucially, given that liberalism is on the defensive everywhere, it\u2019s: how can you get back in the ring?\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I just don't understand what this whole Corbyn thing is for, if it doesn't do anything</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Clegg\u2019s is a memoir that reveals itself by stealth; a book by a man wounded by his experience. One leitmotif is the lack of credit the Lib Dems, and Clegg in particular, got for the coalition\u2019s successes, from putting a brake on austerity to taxing plastic bags. If the Tories liked a policy, he says, they simply claimed it as their own. Today, it\u2019s the <a href=\"http://www.libdems.org.uk/plastic_bag_charge_is_lib_dem_success_story\">plastic bag tax</a> that irks him. \u201cWhat did I see last week? There was a great deal of stuff in the press about the plastic bag tax. I personally insisted on that, and the Conservatives were ferociously opposed. I remember Osborne saying, \u2018This is ridiculous \u2013 I\u2019m not going to accept it.\u2019 Did you see any mention\u2026?\u201d</p> <p>Clegg is so worked up, he can\u2019t complete his sentence. You sound really pissed off, I say. He instantly recovers his cool, and insists he\u2019s anything but. \u201cNo, it\u2019s not my nature to be angry, but am I a bit frustrated? Yes. I did not cater for the sheer brazen ruthlessness with which the Conservative party would hoover up any good news.\u201d</p> <p>Why did he want to form a coalition: to soften austerity or because he wanted power? Simple, he says: power. \u201cFashionable parts of the left now sneer at government, and I\u2019ve never understood that. I can understand it if you\u2019re a philosopher or a religious figure, but if you\u2019re in the secular world of politics, which is a grubby, tough, volatile business, why on earth would you not want to try and do shit? I just don\u2019t understand what this whole <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/jeremy-corbyn\">Corbyn thing</a> is for, if it doesn\u2019t do anything.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c5966a05f4441569f4924379ac7fe85ed6af6a62\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c5966a05f4441569f4924379ac7fe85ed6af6a62/21_158_2248_1349/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Nick Clegg at 10 Downing Street with David Cameron on the first day of coalition government.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">At 10 Downing Street with David Cameron on the first day of the coalition government.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Matt Cardy/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The problem is, Clegg says, he didn\u2019t understand the importance of the political symbols, from <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2010/may/12/coalition-government-general-election-2010\">the Rose Garden press conference</a> with Cameron (which came across as more bromance than business) to his acceptance of a nothingy office with no front entrance (Cameron refused to allow him to use Downing Street as a backdrop for media interviews).</p> <p>Clegg was so busy justifying the Lib Dems\u2019 role as a restraining agent that he forgot to tell the public they were in power. \u201cIt is something I mistakenly played up to. We portrayed ourselves as a political prophylactic, rather than an agent of change.\u201d Actually, he says, the coalition negotiations were a triumph. The Tories agreed to virtually all the Lib Dems\u2019 demands: fixed-term parliaments, scrapping ID cards, a referendum on electoral reform, measures to tackle climate change. \u201cAt the outset, it felt like a genuinely composite government. We got more of our policies into the coalition agreement than they did. And that shows both the strengths and weaknesses of me as a leader, and us as a party, in that we were diligently ticking off the number of policies. But we learned in hindsight that you can get as many of your policies in, but if there\u2019s one policy you don\u2019t, notably tuition fees, that\u2019s the thing people remember.\u201d</p> <p>But reading <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2010/may/20/conservative-liberal-democrat-coalition-agreement-analysis\">the coalition agreement</a>, it looks as if the Lib Dems knew from the start that they would be screwed on tuition fees. The final paragraph, under the heading Education, reads: \u201cIf the response of the government to Lord Browne\u2019s report [the review into higher education funding] is one that Liberal Democrats cannot accept, then arrangements will be made to enable Liberal Democrat MPs to abstain in any vote.\u201d In the event, Clegg did not abstain on the vote to increase tuition fees (from \u00a33,290 a year to a maximum of \u00a39,000); <a href=\"http://www.libdemvoice.org/tuition-fees-how-liberal-democrat-mps-voted-22346.html\">six months into government, he voted in favour</a>.</p> <p>In his book, Clegg accuses Cameron, whom he broadly likes, of hypocrisy, claiming to care about climate change and Europe and the poor, then kowtowing to the right wing of his party. Is it true that when Clegg suggested there needed to be more social housing, Cameron told him it only turned people away from the Tories? \u201cIt would have been in a Quad meeting [the committee of Cameron, George Osborne, Clegg and Danny Alexander], so either Cameron or Osborne. One of them \u2013 I honestly can\u2019t remember whom \u2013 looked genuinely nonplussed and said, \u2018I don\u2019t understand why you keep going on about the need for more social housing \u2013 it just creates Labour voters.\u2019 They genuinely saw housing as a Petri dish for voters. It was unbelievable.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The more I governed with Gove and his team, the more I realised he was just striking a series of superficial poses</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Before long, he says, he was dealing with a very different Tory party from the one with which he went into government. He initially found Osborne bright, funny and empathetic. \u201cOne of the gifts he has is the ability to think of politics from someone else\u2019s point of view, which is genuinely unusual, and why he was such a consummate dealmaker.\u201d But their relationship soured. \u201cWhat I found offputting was the callousness to his political calculations, particularly around welfare. Welfare for Osborne was just a bottomless pit of savings, and it didn\u2019t really matter what the human consequences were, because focus groups had shown that the voters they wanted to appeal to were very anti-welfare, and therefore there was almost no limit to those anti-welfare prejudices. I found that very unattractive, very cynical.\u201d</p> <p>He also accuses <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/theresamay\">Theresa May</a> of distorting figures to stoke up anti-immigrant feeling. \u201cThe Home Office produced <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/335088/SingleMarketFree_MovementPersons.pdf\">a report called Free Movement</a>. It was all about giving red meat to their backbenchers on Europe. She kept saying there was this terrible \u2018abuse\u2019 of freedom of movement, when simply describing EU citizens exercising their right to come and work in the UK. They tried to insert statistics suggesting the number of UK citizens living and working in other EU countries was half a million lower than any other mainstream estimate.\u201d</p> <p>Who does he think comes out worst in his book? Clegg looks appalled: \u201cIt\u2019s not that kind of book.\u201d</p> <p>It is, I say.</p> <p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s not,\u201d he says, firmly. \u201cI don\u2019t know. You tell me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cM\u2026\u201d I begin.</p> <p>He grins. \u201cOh, gosh, yes, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/michaelgove\">Michael Gove</a>. Yep, you\u2019re probably right. Fair enough.\u201d</p> <p>The stories are endless: from Gove hiding in the toilet when Lib Dem education minister David Laws visits him, to Gove leaking apocryphal stories about Gonz\u00e1lez Dur\u00e1ntez to the press, and announcing the return of O-levels on a whim. Clegg tells me Gove was cultured and often had him in stitches, but then he goes for him.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f2d92dc8c598010c9d7aa6a50dc6efc98b58e931\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f2d92dc8c598010c9d7aa6a50dc6efc98b58e931/54_266_3394_2037/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Nick Clegg meets David Cameron, Danny Alexander and George Osborne to plan the coalition\u2019s first budget\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Clegg meets David Cameron, Danny Alexander and George Osborne to plan the coalition\u2019s first budget.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dominic Lipinski/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cThe more I governed with Gove and his team, the more I realised he was just striking a series of superficial poses. You\u2019ve got a generation of politicians very close to the media, people like Boris Johnson and Gove, and the problem is, the skill of tossing off 800 words on one subject and then on another a week later is completely different to governing. With Cameron and Osborne, there was a seriousness about what they were doing \u2013 a deadly seriousness I often didn\u2019t like. But with Gove it was just a series of throwaway poses about our kids\u2019 futures. There\u2019s this ersatz intellectual heft that Gove and his people have that I don\u2019t think is merited.</p> <p>\u201cPeople such as Gove and Johnson have elevated striking poses into a political art form. Their apogee was the referendum. I wanted Gove to win the party leadership. He won the argument, and he should have been in a position of power to face the music.\u201d</p> <p>Clegg recently revealed that Gove was responsible for leaking a story about a supposed conversation Clegg had with the Queen (with Gove present), in which <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/mar/12/queen-elizabeth-brexit-sun-nick-clegg-eu-referendum\">she tore a strip off him for being so unquestioningly pro-European, and suggested she was a Brexiteer</a> \u2013 a conversation <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/mar/09/eurosceptic-rant-by-the-queen-never-happened-says-nick-clegg\">Clegg insists never happened</a>. \u201cIt was complete rubbish. I was lucky enough to be president of the privy council, so I had the huge honour of meeting the Queen pretty well monthly for five years. I don\u2019t remember every conversation we had, but would I remember if I had received this tongue-lashing? Of course I would. And I don\u2019t.\u201d</p> <p>How does he know the story came from Gove? \u201cThe other source of <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/1078504/revealed-queen-backs-brexit-as-alleged-eu-bust-up-with-ex-deputy-pm-emerges/\">the Sun\u2019s story</a> told me.\u201d</p> <p>Of all our recent British political leaders, Clegg is the most bracingly European. He speaks fluent Spanish, Dutch, French and German. His half-Russian father, a descendant of Tsarist nobility, was a successful banker; his Dutch mother had lived in Indonesia, where she and her family were interned in a Japanese prisoner-of-war camp during the second world war. Clegg attended Westminster public school, where he was a keen actor, appearing with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/helena-bonham-carter\">Helena Bonham Carter</a> in a production of The Changeling (she accidentally kicked him in the balls). He studied archaeology and anthropology at Cambridge university, where he appeared in a play about Cyrano de Bergerac under the directorship of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/sam-mendes\">Sam Mendes</a>. There is still something actorly about him. At times, when he asserts himself, his voice shifts from urbane political class to a rasping Ray Winstone.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I thought long and hard about quitting. But it would have been the worst of both worlds</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Clegg went on to study at the University of Minnesota and then the prestigious College of Europe in Bruges, where he met Miriam, today regarded as a leading expert on European trade law. After working for the European Commission, Clegg became a Lib Dem MEP for the East Midlands, and in 2005 won a seat as MP for Sheffield Hallam. Astonishingly, two years later he was leader of the party. Now 49, he looks both young and old for his age \u2013 boyish but jowly, with white chest hair prodding through his T-shirt, and surprisingly hairy ears. He has a bad back, and regularly asks if we can stand up or walk around to ease his discomfort.</p> <p>Again, he talks of the viciousness of the personal attacks on him. At one point, Labour MP Barry Gardiner stood up in parliament and called him a quisling. (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vidkun_Quisling\">Vidkun Quisling</a> was the head of Norway\u2019s government who collaborated with the Nazis.) Did he challenge Gardiner? \u201cNo,\u201d Clegg says quietly. \u201cI think I should have. The advice you get in the frontline of politics is, don\u2019t answer back.\u201d</p> <p>Are you saying that if you had somebody round for dinner and they called you a quisling, you wouldn\u2019t fight back? He smiles apologetically. \u201cI\u2019d probably get up and lamp them,\u201d he says. \u201cWith hindsight, I should have been more outspoken. There\u2019s a very British culture in Westminster where people say unspeakably beastly things to each other in the Chamber, then, when they shuffle next to each other for a cup of tea, they talk about the weather. I\u2019m too Dutch for that.\u201d Only he wasn\u2019t: he took it on the chin.</p> <p>Does he feel a bit sorry for himself? He pulls himself up, straight-backed, and momentarily morphs into <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_Gowen\">the Major from Fawlty Towers</a>. \u201cNo. Never have done. Wasn\u2019t brought up like that. You get on with things and take the knocks. Look, it was a fantastic privilege to do what I did. I\u2019m very lucky. I\u2019m absolutely besotted with my kids, and I survived more or less with my limbs still attached to my body.\u201d</p> <p>As if on cue, a procession of mini-Cleggs strolls by the cafe. His gorgeous boys (14-year-old Antonio, 12-year-old Alberto and seven-year-old Miguel), accompanied by Miriam and her mother, stop to chat. Miriam asks how my flight was, Antonio tells me Manchester United will win the league now that they\u2019ve signed Paul Pogba. And then they are on their way. \u201cSee you later,\u201d Miriam says. Clegg looks at Miriam adoringly, as if he still can\u2019t quite believe his luck. \u201cI was smitten by her the first day,\u201d he says. \u201cBowled over. Love at first sight. She didn\u2019t speak a word of English; our early courtship was in French. She kept telling me stories I couldn\u2019t quite follow. I was so bewitched, it made no difference.\u201d</p> <p>Miriam recently wrote a warts-and-all cookbook, <a href=\"http://bookshop.theguardian.com/made-in-spain.html\">Made In Spain</a>, in which she revealed that the Camerons had wanted to be friends, but she wasn\u2019t really up for it; that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/shortcuts/2016/jul/26/dont-spread-about-sam-cams-hellmanns-mayonnaise-habit\">Samantha Cameron had served the Cleggs roast chicken with a tube of Hellmann\u2019s mayonnaise</a>, rather than making her own; and that she had refused to be in the house, let alone cook, when Osborne visited (Clegg and the then chancellor had a takeaway). Was it embarrassing when Miriam refused to stay around for Osborne? \u201cNot at all,\u201d Clegg says, his voice rising again. \u201cMy embarrassing thing is that I\u2019ve not actually read what Miriam said in her book,\u201d he says by way of a diversion. \u201cI remember her leaving as George came. But she didn\u2019t stalk off. She went out with friends, having put the kids to bed.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"01bd4130d25ec6a50782d3c5d024a92733d334f3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/01bd4130d25ec6a50782d3c5d024a92733d334f3/102_136_4387_2632/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Clegg with his wife, Miriam Gonz\u00e1lez Dur\u00e1ntez\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Clegg with his wife, Miriam Gonz\u00e1lez Dur\u00e1ntez: \u2018I was smitten by her the first day.

Others, no more favourably disposed, told the deputy PM that he\u2019d made his bed and had better lie in it. How much did it take out of him? A lot, he says. In the book, he writes that by 2011 he was working long hours, smoking too much and putting on weight. How many cigarettes? Sometimes three to five a night, he says. There\u2019s something touching about the fact that even his excess is so modestly calibrated. How much weight did he put on? \u201cI didn\u2019t weigh myself, Simon! But Paddy Ashdown told me very sternly, \u2018You\u2019re too fat.\u2019\u201d Did he have to get bigger trousers? \u201cYes.\u201d</p> <p>Did he consider resigning? \u201cI didn\u2019t think, in spring 2011, when I was feeling so shit and was fat and whatever, that I should quit. But there were several times in the last two or three years when I thought long and hard about whether that was the right thing to do. In the end, I thought, it\u2019s the worst of both worlds: you\u2019ve created a government that lots of people heap opprobrium on you for, and then you quit when you\u2019ve got nothing to show for it.\u201d</p> <p>He felt that leading players <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/vincentcable\">Vince Cable</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/chrishuhne\">Chris Huhne</a> failed to give him their full support. (Cable seemed to be preparing to take over the leadership, while Huhne didn\u2019t help matters when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/chris-huhne-trial\">he ended up in prison for perverting the course of justice</a>.) \u201cWell, I don\u2019t think Vince and Chris would ever count themselves as great team players,\u201d Clegg says.</p> <p>If I was skippering the Lib Dems, I say, I\u2019d want team players on my side. \u201cWell, it\u2019s not like that, is it? Vince\u2019s strength, and the reason he\u2019s liked by the public, was precisely because he stood apart. So there was no point in me saying, \u2018Oh, Vince, can you put in a shift in the boiler room with the rest of the team?\u2019 What I did was give them both big departmental responsibilities.\u201d</p> <p>However much Clegg points the finger at a treacherous Tory leadership or the recalcitrant big beasts in his own party, he knows that ultimately there is one person to blame for his failures: himself. The day he agreed to triple tuition fees, he lost credibility. Isn\u2019t it easy to promise to freeze fees when you think you\u2019ll never be in power? \u201cYes, clearly,\u201d he concedes. \u201cAnd when we made that commitment, I didn\u2019t think it was very sensible. Nor did Vince.\u201d</p> <p>You sold yourself as the politician youngsters could trust and you ended up being defined by\u2026</p> <p>He finishes my sentence: \u201cA lack of trust.\u201d</p> <p>Clegg argues there will always be something on which the smaller party in a coalition fails to deliver. But this is different, I say. It wasn\u2019t about failing to deliver, it was about doing something you expressly promised not to. \u201cYes. Right. Yes, I see what you mean. My hunch is, the reason why the tuition fees thing enraged people as much as it did \u2013 and for some people still does, because it\u2019s so personal to people \u2013 is that it\u2019s their sons, their daughters. Getting your kids into university, seeing them in a gown on the mantelpiece, it\u2019s the distillation of a better life for your children. I have spent a lot of time thinking about the emotional pungency of it. It\u2019s like a politician coming out of the television going \u2018Bang!\u2019 [he makes a fist with one hand and delivers a knockout blow to the other] to my face as a parent. That\u2019s my explanation.\u201d</p> <p>Does he replay the conversation he had with Cameron when he agreed to the increase, and come up with alternative scenarios? \u201cYeah, of course. One of the many lessons I\u2019ve learned is that you can\u2019t just spring things on people if they don\u2019t see there is a problem in the first place. We just sprung this massive change on how we were going to fund our universities, without explaining there was a crisis in university funding. So often I do wonder what would have happened if we\u2019d just pushed the university sector over the edge and said, we\u2019re not going to help you out, we\u2019re not going to give you a perfectly formed solution.\u201d</p> <p>So he conceded to Cameron too quickly? \u201cFar too quickly. We should have let the universities talk about it, and yes, there would have been egg on my face, I would have had to swallow my pride. But at least we could have said, \u2018Listen, we are responding to an urgent problem.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>So many of those students who placed that hope in him have since dumped him for Corbyn. They could have been his, I say. \u201cYes. Yep.\u201d Is that his biggest regret? \u201cYes, of course it\u2019s a huge regret, but that is not just a phenomenon in Britain. What you\u2019re seeing across the developed world, particularly among university-educated youngsters active on social media, is a movement from one figure of hope who can deliver the next Jerusalem to the next.\u201d</p> <p>Now he has to look to his own future. \u201cMy days of leadership are over. I promise you, having been as battle hardened as I have \u2013 do you mind if I stand up? \u2013 I\u2019m not hankering for another go in the trenches.\u201d <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/tim-farron\">Tim Farron</a>, the current Lib Dem leader, has given Clegg the <a href=\"http://www.libdems.org.uk/farron_appoints_clegg_to_challenge_government_on_brexit\">job of scrutinising the government\u2019s Brexit strategy and holding it to account</a>. He is keen to do that, and says that if there is a snap election, he will defend his seat in Sheffield Hallam. Beyond that, he doesn\u2019t have a clue; he\u2019s too young for a bit-part life and wants a new career.</p> <p>I ask if the day after the 2015 general election was his lowest point. \u201cWell, you can\u2019t get much lower than that,\u201d Clegg says. But no, it wasn\u2019t. \u201cI felt more wretched after the referendum than after the election. Political parties go up and down. Dare I say it, it\u2019s not the end of the world. I immediately fell on my sword after the election, took responsibility, but we will come back. We already are. But on the 23rd of June we lost something for good as a country, which I feel much more strongly about. You can\u2019t undo a lot of that damage.\u201d</p> <p>He walks me back to the bus station at the edge of town. I tell him I still think his biggest regret is the fact that all those young voters now feel he betrayed them. No, he says, I\u2019m being sentimental: he\u2019s more ruthless than I want to believe. His real regret is failing to deliver constitutional reform. As for tuition fees, if it hadn\u2019t been that, it would have been another issue that would have killed off Cleggmania. But the people he is interested in are those still convinced that coalition government can work \u2013 messy, compromised and occasionally shaming, but always serious politics. And if you believe in governing alongside parties you disagree with, as he does, you can never hope to emerge blemish-free. Actually, he says, the reality, is even less heroic. \u201cThere is absolutely no way that you can maintain a steadfast reputation for integrity.\u201d</p> <h2>\u2018No wonder there was a Nick Clegg Looking Sad website\u2019: an exclusive extract from his revealing new book</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cc1515a72ee15c722dd5381e5836aacf0fd44a3b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cc1515a72ee15c722dd5381e5836aacf0fd44a3b/1510_1184_2489_1493/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Nick Clegg presenting his LBC radio show\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Clegg\u2019s radio phone-in show was seen as a risk, but proved so popular that other MPs have followed suit.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Katherine Anne Rose/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>David Cameron seemed a little on edge. We were alone in his study in Number 10, very shortly after the formation of the coalition, and he wanted to ask me something that had clearly been preying on his mind. \u201cThis is terribly awkward,\u201d he admitted. \u201cThe thing is\u2026 George has for so long had his eye on Dorneywood\u2026 He\u2019s very close to me\u2026 Would you mind if he used Dorneywood instead of you?\u201d He then proposed that I share the foreign secretary\u2019s traditional grace-and-favour countryside retreat, Chevening, rather than Dorneywood, which was ordinarily used by the number two in government.</p> <p>I was a bit taken aback. I thought he wanted to ask me something important. It hadn\u2019t really occurred to me that I might get a retreat to use at weekends, still less that there was any great distinction between one or the other. Cameron\u2019s plea suggested that George Osborne had been measuring up the curtains for years.</p> <p>I accepted the new arrangement and found myself sharing Chevening, a grand mansion in the Kent countryside near Sevenoaks, for the next five years with the foreign secretary, first William Hague and later Philip Hammond. Not at the same time, I hasten to add; that would have been taking coalition a little too far. </p> <p>Whether or not occupying Dorneywood made any difference to anything, I couldn\u2019t say. But, like Westminster itself, many of the so-called trappings of power \u2013 grace-and-favour mansions, grand offices, ministerial Jaguars \u2013 can seem completely alien to people who have not spent their lives preparing for power. As such, it is easy to underestimate their importance. </p> <p>When it was suggested that I take an office with no publicly recognisable entrance of its own, I didn\u2019t mind, as I thought I wouldn\u2019t need an equivalent of the Number 10 door at which to receive guests. When it was decided where I would sit in the House of Commons at Prime Minister\u2019s Questions, I thought it made sense to sit supportively next to the PM, to show that the coalition could work smoothly.</p> <p>Big mistakes. All of them.</p> <p>***</p> <p>From the outside, the first day of the coalition government looked just about as smooth a transition of power as you could wish for, but behind closed doors it was anything but. With the negotiations wrapped up in just five days, the prime minister and I spent the morning of Wednesday, 12 May 2010 in Downing Street, appointing ministers to our first cabinet, before sharing the stage in the sun-drenched Rose Garden. When Cameron turned to me shortly afterwards and told me that, \u201cWe may have overdone it a bit\u201d, he was probably right. It was easy to get a little carried away with the \u201cnew dawn\u201d feel of the occasion. But I soon found out that not only was I physically unprepared for government; government was physically unprepared for me.</p> <p>On that first day in Downing Street, there was no office waiting for me. The in-house team at Number 10 quickly switched into gear for the incoming prime minister, but had little idea how to handle a deputy prime minister sharing power at the top. I was ushered upstairs to one of the first-floor state rooms. There I spent several hours, accompanied by Danny Alexander and a small number of my closest advisers, while the civil service buzzed around the building, supporting the new PM and largely ignoring us. There wasn\u2019t even a phone.</p> <p>While the 200 or so staff in Downing Street leapt into action to support the new prime minister, I was given just a single civil servant. My mistake, at least at first, was to accept the model presented to me. Having negotiated the coalition agreement without the help of civil servants, and with no experience in government myself, I simply didn\u2019t see the need to surround myself with teams of officials. And having witnessed the infantile Whitehall turf war waged by Gordon Brown\u2019s courtiers against Tony Blair, I thought it best to avoid rival power centres. </p> <p>The most unforgiving consequence was the tsunami of paperwork that fell directly to me to contend with. I was asked my opinion on things I didn\u2019t have the remotest clue about \u2013 dense, technical issues to do with the mechanics of everything from local government finance to energy subsidies. Every evening I would plonk myself on the sofa at home with my box and sit there dutifully wading through it, as family life happened around me. I would stay there virtually every night until the early hours. Then I would grab a few hours\u2019 sleep, which were disturbed most nights by our then one-year-old son Miguel, only to get up early to help get our two older boys fed, changed and packed off to school.</p> <p>The effect was not only physically draining, it was politically debilitating, too. Very quickly it became obvious that the central nervous system of Whitehall lay in the daily negotiations between me and Cameron. At the same time, the two most senior Liberal Democrats in the cabinet, Vince Cable and Chris Huhne, were, notwithstanding their obvious intellectual strengths, not known as nature\u2019s keenest team players. From the outset, their focus was devoted to their own departments \u2013 and their own political reputations. While they did this to great effect (and I encouraged them to do so), it meant I was unable to rely on others to defend in the media what we were doing. I soon became such a focal point for anger that I felt the impulse to defend myself publicly. No wonder Osborne said, somewhat smugly, in an interview in 2011 that, having expected to become British politics\u2019 public enemy number one, he \u201chadn\u2019t reckoned on Nick Clegg\u201d.</p> <p>I never contacted newspaper editors in response to negative coverage about myself. My only exception to this rule was when my family was affected. Every few weeks, Miriam and I had to devote a fair amount of time and emotional energy to rebutting ludicrous claims: that Miriam was somehow responsible for human-rights abuses in Western Sahara; that she was guilty of tax irregularities in her law firm several years before she was even employed by it; that our decision to send our Catholic children, who had attended a Catholic primary school, to a Catholic secondary school was a sign of hypocrisy. And so on.</p> <p>I mistakenly assumed that if I worked hard within government, did my homework and took decisions on their merits, then, one way or another, the truth \u2013 that the coalition was acting out of reasonable motives \u2013 would become plain to see and political dividends would follow. What I did not anticipate was what actually happened: I did all that \u2013 and no one knew about it. This enabled critics from the left to lampoon the Liberal Democrats as spineless, and critics from the right to lambast us as illegitimate irritants who shouldn\u2019t have been in government in the first place. The public readily turned away from us. I failed to realise an interesting paradox of modern politics: in an age of unprecedented transparency, the reality of power can still remain obscure to the public.</p> <p>By the spring of 2011, I was both drained and physically unfit. I smoked several cigarettes a night. I got virtually no exercise. Since becoming leader of the Liberal Democrats, I had dealt with pneumonia, chest pains, a broken toe, chronic coughs and bronchitis, while trying to look perky in public at all times. And throughout all of this, I would regularly crisscross London in the early evening to help put our three young boys to bed before returning to Westminster. No wonder there was a Nick Clegg Looking Sad website. They could have added Nick Clegg looking fat, pale and unhealthy, too. </p> <p>Over time, I worked out a better balance. I employed a larger team; I took up weekly kickboxing classes and had a rowing machine installed in a cubbyhole near my office; I cut down on the cigarettes and started to eat better. I handled the vast amount of paperwork more effectively by tackling most of it early in the morning instead of late at night, a switch of technique I later discovered Cameron had adopted, too. </p> <p>I discovered that one of the best ways to master the dysfunctional worlds of Westminster and Whitehall was simply to work outside them as much as possible. I restarted my pre-election habit of holding public question-and-answer sessions. I even started my own call-in show on LBC Radio with the veteran presenter Nick Ferrari. It was condemned as a foolish risk by many in the Westminster village, yet quickly proved to be sufficiently popular that a number of other politicians followed suit.</p> <p>Much of what I have described might seem like the footling ephemera of political life. But I believe it lifts the lid on something more serious: politics is already populated by a surfeit of political professionals and apparatchiks; if we want people with an independent turn of mind who have led normal lives to represent our country in the future, there will need to be a shift. If every youthful misdemeanour is recycled on social media for ever, if the dysfunctional operation of Whitehall continues to expect too much of people at the top, and if politicians cannot protect their loved ones, we should not be surprised if in future parliament is populated by robots, monks and nuns. </p> <p>\u2022 This is an edited extract from Politics: Between The Extremes, by Nick Clegg, published on 15 September by The Bodley Head at \u00a320.

It\u2019s betting that people who need to replace their roofs will be attracted to the company\u2019s solar cell option because it won\u2019t require additional work or dramatically alter the look of the home.</p> <p>In an August conference call with investors, company chairman Elon Musk said people are forced to postpone solar adoption when they know a roof replacement is imminent and that \u201cthere is a huge market segment that is currently inaccessible to SolarCity.\u201d He added that the company\u2019s solar cell roofing \u201clooks way better\u201d and \u201clasts far longer than a normal roof\u201d.<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"57b2c62590d360aa449ff994b561b477d87b32ab\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/57b2c62590d360aa449ff994b561b477d87b32ab/0_0_4148_2761/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Elon Musk, chairman of SolarCity\" width=\"1000\" height=\"666\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Elon Musk, chairman of SolarCity.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rashid Umar Abbasi/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>By integrating a SolarCity roof with Tesla battery packs, it believes those homes could operate on solar power 24-hours a day. The lingering question, however, is whether mainstream homeowners will be able to afford that initial investment.<br></p> <p>A SolarCity representative was tightlipped on costs, saying they could not share details about the product at this time. </p> <p>Some industry players doubt the product can be affordable to most homeowners. Previous versions of photovoltaic roofs \u2013 also called \u201csolar shingles\u201d \u2013 have cost <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.seac.cc/fileadmin/seac/user/doc/SEAC-SUPSI_report_2015_-_BIPV_product_overview_for_solar_facades_and_roofs_1_.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">up to a third more than traditional solar panels</a>, were less efficient, and were far more pricey to install.</p> <p>\u201cWhat [the company is] talking about is a paradigm shift, not just a small leap,\u201d says Scott Franklin, owner of Lumos Solar, which specialises in solar panel architecture and design. \u201cSolarCity is known for being a low-cost, fast installer. Now they\u2019re talking about developing an entirely new product and becoming roofers? In terms of cost, they\u2019re going from selling solar leases to telling somebody they have to replace an entire roof. That\u2019s a dramatic cost difference.\u201d<br></p> <p>In 2009, US multinational Dow Chemical began developing solar shingles. Yet at a price of more than $20,000 per roof, the technology <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/dow-chemical-sheds-solar-shingle-business\" rel=\"nofollow\">was not commercially viable</a> and Dow discontinued the product in June 2016. <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019ll be the battle \u2013 the cost factor,\u201d says Bill Ellard, an economist for the American Solar Energy Society. \u201cBut if SolarCity works with some of the major homebuilders and they can invent their own systems, I think there\u2019s a play there.\u201d<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>But even if it succeeds in creating an affordable product, can SolarCity match the success of other eco-home innovations?<br></p> <p>Smart home devices such as Google\u2019s Nest thermostat are more affordable, and going down in cost each year. Thermostats and energy monitoring systems have taken off in recent years in part because they allow homeowners to cut energy use without changing their behaviour.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"57cb9d397b43071d7bb0068fe14fa9840669c19e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/57cb9d397b43071d7bb0068fe14fa9840669c19e/0_0_2610_2170/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Google\u2019s Nest thermostat\" width=\"1000\" height=\"831\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Google\u2019s Nest thermostat.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: George Frey/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cHomeowners don\u2019t want to think about efficiency; they want it just taken care of,\u201d says John Quale, a sustainable home design professor at the University of New Mexico. \u201cWe are not great about closing curtains or opening windows when we should. That\u2019s why technologies that do things for us are so appealing.\u201d<br></p> <p>Brian Abramson, cofounder of sustainable homebuilder Method Homes in Seattle, Washington, says smart home technology is becoming more mainstream, lower cost, and accessible. \u201cWe probably do Nest thermostats and basic lighting control on 80% of our houses; a couple of years ago there weren\u2019t any smart thermostats, and lighting control was only in 20% of our homes.\u201d<br></p> <p>Success in the residential solar market, by contrast, is heavily dependent on friendly government policies, a model that has proved challenging when tax incentives threaten to expire, or when monopoly utility companies are allowed to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/jan/13/solar-panel-energy-power-company-nevada\">change</a> the way they reimburse solar panel owners for energy put into the grid. <br></p> <p>By entering the home roofing market, SolarCity is also tacitly acknowledging that aesthetic concerns also hinder solar panel adoption. <br></p> <p>\u201cAesthetics are a big deal,\u201d says Franklin. \u201cThe first wave of solar adoption was driven by economics or environmental concerns. Now people are already past the \u2018I think it\u2019s a good idea\u2019 phase. They want to do it, but it has to look good and add to the value of a home rather than just be a bolted on addition.\u201d<br></p> <p>The company\u2019s announcement that it will unveil its solar cell roof \u201cin the coming months\u201d followed news that Tesla <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/aug/01/elon-musk-sells-solar-power-company-solarcity-to-tesla-motors\">will acquire SolarCity as part of a master plan</a> to integrate the solar panel company with Telsa battery products. That marriage between power production and storage could be the difference <a href=\"https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/A-Note-to-Elon-Musk-And-The-Brothers-Rive-on-The-Integrated-Solar-Roof\" rel=\"nofollow\">between failures of the past</a> and what Musk hopes to achieve, Quale says.<br></p> <p>\u201cIf you look at the aspirations of Tesla and SolarCity, they have huge potential. Elon Musk is really talking about getting to the masses, and those companies could very well be an important driver in reducing costs,\u201d he says.<br></p> <p>\u201cThe conventional glass panel arrays have come down substantially in cost in the last five years and there\u2019s no reason to think these roofing materials couldn\u2019t fall into that as well.\u201d<br></p>",
  "<p>Long before he became famous, James Bumgarner changed his name to <a href=\"http://gb.imdb.com/name/nm0001258/\">Garner</a>. If he hadn\u2019t, he might have been slower to succeed. Smart, literate and incurably honest, Garner was a byword in his profession for authenticity, but he permitted himself that one small bogus moment. With the conspicuous and jaw-breaking exception of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zbigniew_Brzezinski\">Jimmy Carter\u2019s national security adviser Zbigniew Brzesinski</a>, Americans of foreign background have always been sensible about changing their names to something easier for the locals to say. Australian immigrants, however, now tend to hang on to their original family moniker, even when it\u2019s an impossible mouthful for anyone without training in phonetics. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/timsoutphommasane\">The politician Tim Soutphommasane</a> is a conspicuous recent example.</p> <p>For a man whose surname no journalist can spell without medical assistance, Soutphommasane \u2013 let\u2019s call him Tim \u2013 is often in the news. Lately, he has become famous all over again for complaining that too many people in the Australian political world don\u2019t even try to pronounce his name. Since his name sounds wrong even when you say it right, it\u2019s easy to see why. His name is just very hard to say even when you take it apart, syllable by syllable. But Tim thinks we aren\u2019t trying hard enough.</p> <p>I salute his respect for the authentic, but I can only say that I&#xa0;never made a smarter move than when I changed my name from Klaus Jamselpanowicz back there in the day. Since it meant something obscene even in Croatian, it would undoubtedly have stunted my career as a television news announcer, if only for the time it took to say, \u201cHere is the news.

  "<p>The closing decades of an artist\u2019s life do not generally make the biographer\u2019s heart beat faster, but <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/monet\" title=\"\">Claude Monet</a> is one of a handful of painters who&#xa0;bucks the pattern of an irrelevant old age. While it\u2019s true that by the time he was 73 he had accumulated all the usual dragging baggage \u2013 outhouses full of fancy cars, a taste for expensive wine and a sprawl of dependants \u2013 it was also now that he&#xa0;produced career-defining work. More specifically, he produced what he&#xa0;called his <em>Grande D\u00e9coration</em>, consisting of those eight giant <a href=\"http://www.musee-orangerie.fr/en/article/set-orangerie\" title=\"\">waterlily murals</a> that curve around the&#xa0;Orangerie des Tuileries in Paris.</p> <p>These canvases were hardly Monet\u2019s first pass at the subject \u2013 he\u2019d been doing waterlilies, or <em>nymph\u00e9as</em>, for 30 years, in a variety of sizes, colours and shapes. But these are the ones you think of first \u2013 huge bruised stretches of purple and green, broken up by sudden splotches of mustard and puce. At the time, critics described the <em>Grande D\u00e9coration</em> as \u201cserene\u201d; today they\u2019d probably say \u201cimmersive\u201d. But if we\u2019re being honest, we might also call them clammy and uncanny.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Monet employed six local men to tend his garden and was known behind his back as 'le marquis'</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The darkness of these late lilies compared with the earlier versions is explained by the trauma of their making, which Ross King makes the subject of this fine, fluent book. Until the moment in 1914 when Monet picked up&#xa0;his paintbrush to begin his final cycle of lilies, it looked as though France\u2019s greatest living artist was going to coast into an anodyne old age. His beloved wife had died three years earlier, his eyesight was clouding with cataracts and he had more than enough money in the bank. On his estate at <a href=\"http://fondation-monet.com/en/giverny-2/\" title=\"\">Giverny</a>, the village 50 miles from Paris where he had settled in 1883, Monet employed six local men to tend his garden and was known behind his back as \u201cle marquis\u201d.</p> <p>The war changed everything, galvanising Monet into producing a Leviathan piece of painting that stretched eventually to 300 feet. Although he didn\u2019t initially admit it to himself, this was clearly designed as public art, which is why, in 1918, Monet offered it to the nation \u2013 and the nation, battered, bruised and in desperate need of a pick-me-up, said yes. For although <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/jonathanjonesblog/2014/aug/22/impressionism-sunrise-claude-monet\" title=\"\">impressionism</a>, the art movement Monet had spearheaded with Renoir and Degas 50 years earlier, had started to seem pass\u00e9, its determined insouciance was&#xa0;exactly what was needed now. Monet, after all, wasn\u2019t famous just for painting cathedrals, haystacks and lovely girls in white dresses, but for capturing the sunshine that buzzed around them. It was that sunshine, which spoke of long days at the beach or in the park, that provided the perfect reminder of just what it was that had been at stake during these five terrible years.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/commentisfree/2016/jan/26/the-guardian-view-on-london-new-monet-exhibition-glory-of-the-garden\">The Guardian view on London\u2019s new Monet exhibition: the glory of the garden | Editorial</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The irony was that it soon became apparent that there was nothing remotely optimistic or even particularly French about the <em>Grande D\u00e9coration</em>. Throughout the decade during which Monet wrenched it up from his bowels, the \u201cpainter of happiness\u201d behaved like someone short of serotonin. He terrorised his stepdaughter Blanche, who doubled as his daughter-in-law and studio assistant. When he got frustrated with a canvas, which was often, he either kicked it with his clogs or ran it through with a kitchen knife. And while there\u2019s no doubting his genuine horror at the fate befalling France \u2013 Verdun was less than 200 miles away from Giverny and four members of his family were at the front \u2013 it didn\u2019t stop Monet behaving like a spoiled prince while millions of young men were losing their lives. He insisted that he could only work if the government magicked up a steady supply of cigarettes, petrol and coal, the three things he considered essential to his creative flow.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The waterlily pond was a laboratory in which he carefully assembled the colours and shapes to which he required access</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Nor, suggests King, in what is a careful unpicking of cherished art historical narratives, does the provenance of the waterlilies stand up&#xa0;to scrutiny. The pond at Giverny was entirely manmade, created by diverting the water supply from the village (when the locals protested that they needed it for their laundry and cattle, \u201cle marquis\u201d told them to get stuffed). And most of the plants were not native but were hothouse cultivars shipped in from South America and Egypt. In short, the fabled waterlily location at Giverny, far from being a natural outcrop of rural France, was a laboratory in which Monet carefully assembled the colours and shapes to which he required access at a moment\u2019s notice (he maintained that the Normandy light changed every seven minutes and he needed to be on hand to capture it on canvas).</p> <p>Perhaps the highly confected nature of the <em>Grande D\u00e9coration</em> doesn\u2019t matter because, in truth, it is often hard to know what the paintings are supposed to be. The critics, who in the 1870s had puzzled over the blurred outlines of Monet\u2019s sunrises, seascapes and picnicking desmoiselles, would have been completely stumped by it. There is no up nor down in these late waterlily panels but simply passages of&#xa0;colour, sprawls of pigment, localised flurries and bunches of paint. Here is&#xa0;impressionism in its last hurrah, pushed towards its logical destination of abstraction. It\u2019s for this reason that&#xa0;mid-century American artists, including Mark Rothko and Jackson Pollock, found the <em>Grande D\u00e9coration</em> such an inspiration: frameless, refusing the eye a resting place, these 22 panels are less about waterlilies or willows or the morning sun than they are about the pleasure of paint.</p> <p>Readers of biography tend to require more than potted art history to keep them going. Above all, they like love affairs, and those are thin on the ground when the subject is over 80. Luckily for King, there is a candidate on hand for the role of Monet\u2019s <em>petit ami</em>. It comes in the unlikely form of Georges Clemenceau, the politician and wartime prime minister, whose nickname \u201cThe Tiger\u201d suggests that he wasn\u2019t a complete sweetheart. Monet, though, was the one person who could make the tiger go soft on the inside. Clemenceau babied Monet through his endless crises, nagged him to see eye doctors, and made sure cigarettes and coal arrived at Giverny on schedule, even while the rest of the country starved and froze. Most important of&#xa0;all, the tiger chivvied his dilatory friend into firming up the timetable for&#xa0;handing over those 22 panels: nearly a decade after the armistice, Monet was still refusing to let them go.</p> <p>In the end, Clemenceau was obliged&#xa0;to wait until Monet\u2019s death in December 1926 before he could bustle the waterlilies into the Orangerie. It&#xa0;was not, in truth, a particularly glorious moment. All those colourful smudges and loose brushwork seemed&#xa0;vaporous and ephemeral in comparison with the rugged inquiry into form that you got with the cubists and futurists. And the Orangerie was hardly a prestige location, having most&#xa0;recently been used for dog shows. Still, biography loves nothing better than a&#xa0;reputational wilderness, followed by&#xa0;glorious resurrection. In a&#xa0;final chapter, King charts Monet\u2019s gradual postwar rise in reputation, until the point where today he reigns supreme, bobbing far above the vagaries of taste and fashion, and settled comfortably into the realm of&#xa0;the immortals.</p> <p>\u2022 To order <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/mad-enchantment.html?utm_source=editoriallink&amp;utm_medium=merch&amp;utm_campaign=article\" title=\"\">Mad Enchantment</a> for \u00a320 (Bloomsbury, RRP \u00a325) go to bookshop.theguardian.com or call 0330 333 6846.

Fancier restaurants often offer great-value lunch menus. <a href=\"http://www.elite.fi/fi/menu/lounas/\">Elite</a> (meal of the day \u20ac10.20, set menu \u20ac51) opened in 1932 and used to be the favourite of the city\u2019s cultural and artistic circles. The decor is still art deco, the menu consists of Finnish traditional dishes (lots of salmon and <em>vorschmack</em> \u2013 ground herring or meat with onion) and service is old-school.<br></p> <h2>Where to drink</h2> <p>Teurastamo, Helsinki\u2019s own meatpacking district, opened four years ago and is fun for a night out. Recently the B-Smokery restaurant expanded and opened a cosy <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/bsideHKI/\">B-Side Bar</a>, the perfect place to start the evening, with a changing selection of beers and all sorts of American whiskeys. From Teurastamo, it\u2019s a short walk to the block locals call the \u201cparty triangle\u201d. A former matchstick factory has been transformed into three bars.

Luckily for budget travellers, Airbnb offers over 2,000 rooms and apartments at average of 50\u20ac a night. High living standards mean you\u2019ll find lots of nicely decorated places. To stay in a unique historical setting, the <a href=\"http://www.hostelhelsinki.fi/en/services/hostel/\">Hostel Suomenlinna</a> (dorm beds \u20ac24, doubles from \u20ac65) is a former Russian schoolhouse on the world heritage island of the same name, a 15-minute ferry ride (\u20ac3,50) from the main market square. In this clifftop setting in the south-west corner of the island, it is hard to remember you are in a capital city.<br></p> <h2><strong>If you do just one thing</strong> \u2026</h2> <p>Visit a sauna. Before modern bathrooms, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2016/jun/28/finland-helsinki-lapland-health-spa-sauna\">neighbourhood saunas were the way to keep clean in Finland</a>. There are still a few original saunas left, and lately several new public saunas have opened. A real gem is <a href=\"http://kulttuurisauna.fi/\">Kulttuurisauna</a> (\u20ac15). Architect Tuomas Toivonen and illustrator Nene Tsuboi built the minimalist house during Helsinki\u2019s World Design Capital year (2012). The wood-pellet-heated sauna is in a concrete brutalist district, Merihaka, and offers a great view over the icebreakers.

When you tell people you live here, the response is immediate: \u201c<em>Parma, che bella!</em>\u201d. Then they\u2019ll tell you that the Parmigiani are aloof and unfriendly. The city is compact and easy to navigate by foot, and you can travel further afield by bike or on the reliable, cheap bus network. A tour of the historic centre \u2013 starting with the duomo, baptistry, and painted ceiling at San Paolo convent, then heading over the river via Palazzo della Pilotta to the Palazzo Ducale \u2013 is fascinating and not too demanding.</p> <h2>Where to eat</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8d9e2afa7b564239dd6b28a8e510a1b267064811\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8d9e2afa7b564239dd6b28a8e510a1b267064811/0_73_5119_3071/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The platter of tiny meats \u2026 a plate of salumi di Parma\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The platter of tiny meats \u2026 a plate of salumi di Parma.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Whether it\u2019s prosciutto, pasta or parmesan cheese, this city is defined by its food. Even the United Nations says so \u2013 last year Unesco declared Parma a Creative City of Gastronomy. Yes, you can find gourmet burgers, sushi bars and street food \u2013 but Parma is not really cut out for food fads. The best way to see how food is celebrated here is to visit one of the <em>sagre</em> (festivals) that take place all year round. <a href=\"http://www.golagolafestival.it/\">Gola! Gola!</a>, a slickly organised event with TV chefs and celebrity authors, launched in June this year on the back of the Unesco stamp, and is likely to become an annual fixture. In autumn the action moves beyond the city to the <a href=\"http://www.festivaldelprosciuttodiparma.com/programma/\">prosciutto festival</a>, the<a href=\"http://www.fieradialbareto.it/la-fiera/programma/\"> mushroom festivals in the nearby Val di Taro</a>, <a href=\"http://www.tartufonerofragno.it/\">black truffle month</a> in Calestano and <a href=\"http://novemberporc.it/it-IT/home-page.aspx\">November Porc</a>, four weekends of pigging out in the <a href=\"http://www.consorziodelculatellodizibello.it/index_eng.html\"><em>culatello</em> towns</a> along the river Po. Most can be reached easily by bus or train for a handful of euros. If you don\u2019t have time for an excursion, join the queue of students and office workers for a blow-out sandwich at <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/clinicadelpanino/\">Walter Clinica del Panino </a>or the legendary <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/Pep%C3%A8n-Official-1394613000797861/\">Pepen</a>, both a few metres from the central Piazza Garibaldi. Another \u20ac20 will get you a plate of <em>salumi di Parma</em> (cured ham, cooked shoulder of pork, salame, pancetta, lardo\u2026) followed by fresh tortelli (pasta stuffed with squash or chard) at <a href=\"http://www.trattoriacorrieri.it/\">Trattoria Corrieri</a> or <a href=\"http://www.osteriadellozingaro.it/\">Osteria dello Zingaro</a>. <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/Trattoria-DA-Antonia-253596378057641/\">Da Antonia</a>, a 10-minute walk from the centre, is one of the few surviving traditional workers\u2019 <em>trattorie</em>. Always packed and with a great atmosphere, it\u2019s only open at lunchtimes and serves fresh, affordable (\u20ac15-20) three-course meals. And of course, if in doubt, roll it out: the best pizzeria in town, <a href=\"http://www.pizzeriaorfeo.it/\">Orfeo</a> does a simple but delicious thin-crust pizza of tomatoes and mozzarella di bufala with prosciutto crudo (\u20ac8).</p> <h2>Where to drink</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"50b13745387864e4f5a75ab10d7ea88b86af5871\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/50b13745387864e4f5a75ab10d7ea88b86af5871/0_0_960_576/500.jpg\" alt=\"Bastian Contrario, Parma\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bastian Contrario.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Roberto Perotti</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>At some point in the recent past the Italians started drinking beer.

Then there is lambrusco. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2014/apr/05/lambrusco-uk-wine-review-fiona-beckett\">rebirth of the fizzy red</a> is not big news any more, but if you want to see where the revolution was hatched, Parma is a short bike ride from the organic vineyards of <a href=\"http://www.camillodonati.it/index.php?filosofia\">Camillo Donati</a> and Azienda <a href=\"http://www.quarticello.it/en/\">Quarticello</a>, where they will sell you a bottle for \u20ac6-\u20ac7.</p> <h2>Where to stay</h2> <p><a href=\"http://www.hotel-torino.it/\">Hotel Torino</a> is bang in the centre with doubles from around \u20ac90.

But there\u2019s a vibrant \u201calternative\u201d scene behind its conservative facade. The Reeperbahn is its infamous party and red light district, but just a few streets away is a rich bistro and street food scene as well as cool cafes, bars and clubs. Dig further and there are lots of hip hangouts such as the occupied former theatre Rote Flora in the Sternschanze district, the artists\u2019 quarter <a href=\"http://das-gaengeviertel.info/\">G\u00e4ngeviertel</a>, or the <a href=\"http://www.pudel.com/\">Golden Pudel Club</a> (pudel.com), recently resurrected after a fire.</p> <h2>Where to eat</h2> <p>Hamburg is still Germany\u2019s most important port, and with international trade have come international cuisines. Try the Indian bistro Badshah (Bremer Reihe 24, no website) in colourful St Georg. It\u2019s not romantic, but the paneer and lentil curry is a must (\u20ac6.50). Din Hau, on the other side of Hamburg\u2019s main station, is a simple place, but serves possibly the best Cantonese roasted duck you\u2019ll ever taste (\u20ac8.50). For street food, brothers Koral and Onur Elci opened <a href=\"http://www.focacceria-bonassola.com/\">Focacceria Bonassola</a> earlier this year close to Altona station\u2013 just looking at the golden foccacia with spinach, gorgonzola or spicy<em> salsiccia</em> is a sensual experience.</p> <h2>Where to drink</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"46e793e0b5bd4e8daca66b592dec245fabc437f3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/46e793e0b5bd4e8daca66b592dec245fabc437f3/0_0_1486_1024/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Clockers bar HAMBURG\" width=\"1000\" height=\"689\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Clockers bar</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: clockers Bar</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The practice of \u201ccornering\u201d has been around for a couple of summers now: crowds gather by kiosks or in front of bars to start the night off by downing a \u20ac1.50 beer. Try the Tabakb\u00f6rse kiosk in Sternschanze. If the weather\u2019s bad, the streets between Sternschanze and St Pauli are full of great bars, such as the <a href=\"http://thewalrusbar.de/\">Walrus Bar</a>) or <a href=\"http://www.clockers.hamburg/\">Clockers</a>, a tiny gin bar that has a tree growing in the middle and moss on the walls, and produces its own spirits.

  "<p>People will soon be able to take up to \u00a3500 out of their pension pots tax-free, as long as they spend it on financial advice. The government <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/new-government-advice-allowance-to-make-retirement-planning-easier\">this week unveiled details</a> of the \u201cpensions advice allowance\u201d that will be available to millions of people well in advance of their retirement.</p> <p>It is possible that people as young as 45 could be eligible for the scheme, which will be in addition to the normal 25% tax-free lump sum you can take out of your pot from age 55. We look at what is proposed and what sort of advice \u00a3500 can buy.</p> <p><strong>What\u2019s happening?</strong></p> <p>An individual will be able to withdraw the money and use it to pay for advice on all the financial products they hold that will contribute towards their retirement income, such as pensions and any other savings and investments such as Isas. This proposal was unveiled in the March budget, and on Tuesday ministers announced <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/introducing-a-pensions-advice-allowance/introducing-a-pensions-advice-allowance-consultation\">how they think it should work</a>. The government says: \u201cIndividuals using the pensions advice allowance would still be entitled to the same tax-free lump sum as at present when they ultimately come to take their pension benefits.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Who\u2019s eligible?</strong></p> <p>It\u2019s almost certain that only those with a defined contribution (aka money purchase) pension will be able to access the new allowance. However, if you are one of many people who has had several different jobs over the years and has both defined contribution and defined benefit pensions, you will be able to use the allowance to pay for advice on all of your pension assets. Defined benefit pensions include final salary and so-called career average schemes.</p> <p>Some of the crucial details have yet to be decided - for example, how old you will have to be to take advantage of the allowance. A public consultation has been launched and will run until late October. At the moment ministers are only saying the allowance will be available before the age of 55 to encourage people to engage with their retirement planning early.</p> <p><strong>When is this coming in?</strong></p> <p>It will take effect from April 2017.</p> <p><strong>How will it work?</strong></p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Unbiased claims that people who take advice can get an extra income of \u00a33,654 every year of their retirement</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>You will be able to use the cash to pay for any type of fully regulated financial advice \u2013 ie, personalised advice that may well include specific recommendations about products. This advice might be face-to-face, online or over the phone. Services that only provide general guidance will be excluded, and the adviser you use must be authorised and regulated by the <a href=\"https://www.the-fca.org.uk\">Financial Conduct Authority</a>.</p> <p>One downside is that pension providers will not be required by law to offer this facility. They will be encouraged to, but won\u2019t have to.</p> <p><strong>How will I access the cash?</strong></p> <p>To meet the rules, the money will need to be paid direct from the pension scheme/provider to the financial adviser. Tom McPhail, head of retirement policy at investment and pension firm Hargreaves Lansdown, says an individual would be able to instruct their pension provider that they had engaged a particular adviser, and would authorise the provider to make a payment to the adviser.</p> <p>So if Mr Smith has a pension pot of \u00a340,000 and decides to take \u00a3500 of advice, then that\u2019s the amount withdrawn from his fund. There would be no tax deducted \u2013 his pot would simply be reduced to \u00a339,500.</p> <p>The main incentive for an individual is that they are, in effect, getting advice tax-free, so for a basic rate taxpayer it\u2019s effectively cost them \u00a3400, while for those on a higher rate, the cost is just \u00a3300. This money could also be used as a contribution towards advice that costs more than \u00a3500.</p> <p><strong>Do I just get one allowance?</strong></p> <p>The government is considering letting people use the allowance more than once. That means you could use it to help pay for more advice if your circumstances change a few years down the line.</p> <p><strong>What sort of advice can I get for \u00a3500?</strong></p> <p>According to the government, face-to-face financial advice costs \u00a3150 per hour on average, and that for pension/retirement planning, you might be looking at up to nine hours, which would add up to \u00a31,350. But people whose affairs are simple won\u2019t need that long, and some will be happy to go with an online or phone-based service, which will probably be cheaper.</p> <p>McPhail says that when it comes to face-to-face advice, \u201c\u00a3500 is probably at the lower end of any advisory transaction. Most advisers will not engage for much less than that, simply because of the fixed costs involved in taking on a new client.\u201d</p> <p>For example, Hargreaves Lansdown\u2019s minimum charge for a retirement consultation is \u00a3495 plus VAT. For that, you get a consultation with an adviser \u2013 which might be over the phone \u2013 and a report containing recommendations. But, given that \u00a3495 is the minimum, that assumes the individual\u2019s needs are very straightforward and can be dealt with fairly quickly and easily. People with complicated affairs might be looking at spending several thousand pounds \u2013 but if that secures a much better income in retirement, that might represent excellent value for them.</p> <p><strong>Are there cheaper services?</strong></p> <p>The leading mutual LV= (Liverpool Victoria) has an online service called Retirement Wizard which provides fully regulated advice. It says people approaching retirement are able to get a personalised retirement advice report for \u00a3199, with recommendations on the specific financial products they should buy, and phone support if necessary. However, you have to be within three months of wanting to access your pension and have a maximum pot of \u00a3150,000. For an additional \u00a3499, LV= will make all the arrangements and set up your retirement plan.</p> <p><strong>What about free advice?</strong></p> <p>The government\u2019s free <a href=\"https://www.pensionwise.gov.uk/\">Pension Wise</a> service might be able to help if you are 50 or over and have a defined contribution pension.

  "<p>Buying a mobile phone for someone starting secondary school is a minefield \u2013 and not just financially. Some parents will argue that no child of 11 needs a phone; others that it is essential. And with the vast choice of handsets and deals on offer \u2013 from pay as you go to contracts and sim-only \u2013 the choice is bewildering, with the cost of getting it wrong surprisingly high.</p> <p>Below we list what we think are the best deals \u2013 with a word of warning before you get your wallet out. If you are planning to send your son or daughter to school with one of the latest smartphones, think again. Of the thousands of mobiles stolen every month, as many as two-thirds are taken from children aged 13-16. Buy your child the latest iPhone and the chances are they will no longer have it at the end of the first week.</p> <h2><strong>The cheapest basic phone</strong></h2> <p>Ideally you should get a cheap, old handset that isn\u2019t going to appeal to thieves. Parents often use this moment as an opportunity to upgrade their own phone and pass on their bashed up handset to their child. If you need to buy one, however, the Nokia 130 will be a faithful and tough friend \u2013 and crucially costs just \u00a33.74 from <a href=\"https://www.carphonewarehouse.com/nokia/130.html#!colour=black&amp;dealType=pm\">Carphone Warehouse</a>, when bought with a \u00a310 EE top-up. Once you have used up the credit, put in an <a href=\"https://mobile.asda.com/rates-and-services\">Asda PAYG sim</a>, which we reckon is the best value non-contract service. Calls are 8p per minute and texts are 4p. If you want your child to have a basic phone just to keep in touch, this is the way to go. The same handset can be bought unlocked at Tesco for \u00a319.</p> <h2><strong>The best entry-level deal</strong></h2> <p>The standout option here is the Moto E (2nd generation) from <a href=\"http://\">Tesco Mobile</a>. Parents will need to sign a 24-month contract at \u00a37.50 a month, for which they get the handset for free, 250 minutes of calls, 5,000 texts and 500MB of data a month (enough to spend 25 hours on Facebook). The phone itself will do most things teens require, and has \u201cgorilla glass\u201d so the screen shouldn\u2019t be too easy to smash.</p> <p>Also, from a parent\u2019s point of view, Tesco Mobile lets you cap the child\u2019s bill. They will not be able to make calls or access mobile data once he or she reaches a set limit, but they can still receive calls. Tesco Mobile also lets users bar premium rate calls/text services, and has perhaps the best customer service in the sector, making it hard to beat for parents.</p> <p>Generally, kids that make several calls a day or, more likely, use significant quantities of mobile data, will be better off on a monthly plan</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Register with Immobilise, so if the phone is stolen, then recovered, it can be checked against the database and returned</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <h2><strong>Smartphone options</strong></h2> <p>If you are looking for something a bit more sophisticated, the <a href=\"https://www.carphonewarehouse.com/huawei/p8-lite.html#!colour=black&amp;dealType=pm\">Huawei P8 Lite</a> is a good iPhone alternative. It is available for free from Carphone Warehouse if you sign an \u00a311.50 per month contract which includes 300 minutes and 500MB of data. This is on Carphone\u2019s own iD network (which is provided by Three), and also allows parents to cap the bill.</p> <p>If your older son or daughter insists on an Apple, the iPhone 5s is available for \u00a315.50 a month (and no upfront cost) with similar call and data terms as the Huawei, again at Carphone Warehouse. Tesco offers the same iPhone for \u00a314.50 a month with more minutes per month but a \u00a360 upfront payment.</p> <h2><strong>Best sim-only deal</strong></h2> <p>If you already have a phone, or prefer to buy one outright, a sim-only deal is the way to go. ID offers 500 minutes, 1GB of data and 5,000 texts for a bargain \u00a35 a month, which once again can be capped. If you want a lot more data, its 4MB a month deal costs \u00a310 and is more than enough for most teens.</p> <p>Tesco Mobile\u2019s sim-only plans start at \u00a37.50 a month. One option to consider is whether your home phone provider is offering a free sim as part of your package. BT, TalkTalk and Virgin all do, but check the terms closely as you generally can\u2019t cap the bill and are liable for all charges to the account.</p> <h2><strong>School policies</strong></h2> <p>Be aware of the school\u2019s policy on phones before you buy, as there are no national rules on the matter. Many ban them entirely, while others allow them to be used at lunch time only \u2013 and you may want to impose your own ban once you research their impact.</p> <p>While some fee-paying schools have promoted the use of mobiles in classrooms, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2015/may/16/schools-mobile-phones-academic-results\">research published by the Centre for Economic Performance</a> found that banning them from school grounds adds up to the equivalent of an extra week\u2019s schooling over a pupil\u2019s academic year. GCSE results at the Ebbsfleet Academy in Kent improved dramatically after phones were banned in 2013.</p> <h2><strong>Taking control</strong></h2> <p>Many parents are unaware they can ask mobile providers to block access to porn and other sites deemed unsuitable for under-18s. Simply ask for parental controls to be turned on. Ofcom has details on <a href=\"http://consumers.ofcom.org.uk/internet/online-safety-and-security/parental-controls-for-mobile-phones/\">what parents should know</a>.</p> <p>With phone theft a major problem, keep a record of the handset\u2019s unique IMEI number, which will identify it. Just type *#06# into the phone\u2019s dialler and it will display a 15-digit code. You can use this to register at <a href=\"https://www.immobilise.com/\">Immobilise.com</a>, so if the phone is stolen and then found or recovered by the police, they can check it against the database and potentially return it. You should of course report any theft to the network immediately.</p> <p>Don\u2019t bother buying mobile insurance \u2013 policies rarely pay out if the handset was stolen at school or college.</p> <h2>Shopping around</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6ac3a0857da531228b12e56aa276248a0420152e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6ac3a0857da531228b12e56aa276248a0420152e/0_120_6888_4133/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Arenike Adebajo and her sister Ife.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Arenike Adebajo (left) with her sister Ife.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Linda Nylind/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>My 14-year-old sister Ife goes back to school this week, and as her older sibling it\u2019s been my job to find her the perfect phone \u2013 and one that won\u2019t break the bank, <em>writes Arenike Adebajo</em>. Her starting point was that the only one worth having was an iPhone. I\u2019m sure this is what every 14-year-old says, but we had to be more realistic. We began our research online.</p> <p>As above, the cheapest we found was the Nokia 130, but Ife gave this an emphatic no \u2013 she can\u2019t get her head round a phone without a Qwerty keyboard, a camera or internet access. Besides, she said, it\u2019s the same one grandma has. Fair enough.</p> <p>Next up was the Moto E, but Ife thinks it\u2019s too chunky \u2013 although she would use it if she had to \u2026 maybe. In truth, it didn\u2019t go down too well. Nor did the Microsoft Lumia 550.</p> <p>What did was the stylish Sony Xperia XA. It has the look and feel of a higher cost model and she loves the rose-gold colour. There\u2019s a front camera so she can Snapchat, and at \u00a315 a month from Carphone Warehouse with 1GB of data and unlimited minutes and texts she\u2019s sold. It\u2019s almost as pretty as the iPhone 6, she says approvingly.</p> <p>But in the end, my mum decides to give Ife her old iPhone 4 with a monthly sim, while she upgrades to a nice new iPhone 6. Everyone\u2019s happy \u2026 ish.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 4 September 2016. It previously said that EE provided the network for Carphone Warehouse\u2019s iD network.

Asked in September if he planned to return to action, he said: \u201cIt\u2019s up in the air.

I still have the competitive itch to play, but at the same time 30-plus games\u201d \u2013 the length of an English season \u2013 \u201cisn\u2019t always the most appealing.\u201d <br></p> <p>PRO Rugby has found itself <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/sep/02/pro12-north-america-us-pro-rugby-league\">in something of a tug of love</a>, between those who want American pro rugby to grow domestically and those who would import teams to play in overseas leagues. The Premiership has stolen a march on the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/23/pro-12-north-american-teams-expanded-league\">Pro12</a>, <a href=\"http://www.rugbyworld.com/news/boudjellal-chases-the-american-dream-68460\">Toulon</a> and Super Rugby by bagging TV coverage and staging <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/mar/13/london-irish-saracens-premiership-united-states\">a regular-season game</a> in Harrison, New Jersey last March. Saracens won it, beating Corbisiero\u2019s old team London Irish in an entertaining match.</p> <p>Two as yet unconfirmed teams will return to the Red Bull Arena in 2017. In 2016, in the press box, some cynical hacks wondered if Irish and Sarries had been told to throw the ball about, to put on a show to sell the product. Corbisiero said Americans could come to love the Premiership\u2019s many styles.<br></p> <p>\u201cPerhaps the one area we may hit some speed bumps will be the winter months,\u201d he said, \u201cwhere it becomes a bit more of a tactical game, a bit of chess, and sometimes you need a bit of an appreciation of the techniques and the tactics of the game. I\u2019d hope to convey that to the audience.</p> <p>\u201cBut at the beginning of the season, the weather will be nice, the pitches will be firm and I think there will be an emphasis on playing rugby.\u201d </p> <p>Picking out the Saracens, England and Lions fly-half <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/owen-farrell\">Owen Farrell</a> as one man for US fans to watch closely, he added: \u201cIf you look at the way the England team has been playing, Eddie Jones has been trying to move them far away from that traditional set-piece-orientated kicking game.

Not all of those are expats.</p> <p>\u201cBeing a US citizen,\u201d Corbisiero said, \u201cI played for the USA under-19s; I have friends who have played in the pro league over here who have really enjoyed it. There\u2019s an ever-growing participation at high-school level, collegiate and now post-collegiate, when you can\u2019t play football really anymore. Rugby is a sport you can play socially for a long time \u2026 I\u2019m sure we\u2019re going to have an audience.\u201d</p> <p>Maybe the US will learn to love rugby. Maybe it already does. Maybe the New Yorker \u2013 which changed \u201cfly back\u201d to \u201cfullback\u201d, correct as a rugby position although Cipriani doesn\u2019t actually play there \u2013 meant what it said in the first place.

  "<h2>Job interviews frighten my teenage son and make him feel useless. How can I help?</h2> <p><strong>My 19-year-old son has developed a phobia of interviews, refusing to apply for a job that involves one. This means he is restricted to either not working or doing contract labouring jobs where he is self-employed, the rates are terrible and the working day is long and hard.</strong></p> <p><strong>He is introverted and not a great talker.&#xa0;He left school with six GCSEs at C grade, including maths, English language and science, which we thought was pretty good considering he never liked school and struggled with most subjects (I think he is dyslexic).&#xa0;He started a BTec in engineering but dropped out.&#xa0;</strong></p> <p><strong>The problems seemed to start when he was 16 and he applied for weekend work at two of the big supermarkets. He did his best at the interviews but was asked at one to give a two-minute presentation, which frightened the life out of him. He didn\u2019t get any offers and has interpreted this as meaning he is useless, and now says he \u201ccan\u2019t do interviews\u201d. I know there is nothing wrong with being a labourer for a while, but he is capable of so much more. An apprenticeship in a trade would be ideal (in my opinion), but he refuses to consider any roles as he says he won\u2019t get through the interview.</strong></p> <p><strong>How can I support him to overcome this fear \u2013 even if it is to back off and just leave him to work it out?</strong></p> <p><strong>Jeremy says</strong></p> <p>You should no longer tuck away in parenthesis the possibility that your son is dyslexic. You need to establish once and for all whether he is. Just about everything you can do will be affected by this. I have no medical qualifications so be certain to check any advice I give you against someone who has, but I\u2019ve heard enough to know that, when understood and accepted, it does not have to blight a person\u2019s life in any way.</p> <p>Dyslexia should carry no stigma. It\u2019s surprisingly common: some estimates say 1 in 10 people in Britain are affected, and the great majority live normal, rewarding lives. There are even those who have found it has given them an extra aptitude for certain skills, for instance, problem solving.</p> <p>So my amateur guess is that your son, having struggled at school, has been seriously bruised by a couple of traumatic experiences, such as being asked to make that two-minute presentation. As a consequence he has retreated into thinking he\u2019s useless. Please seek professional advice.</p> <p><strong>Readers say </strong></p> <p>\u2022 As a retired senior IT manager, I dealt with a number of people suffering from interview phobia. Most had been in work for years and never had to go through the interview process until departmental reorganisation forced them into it. I have mentored a handful of people through this. One in particular could not even give his own name when asked, and abruptly left the&#xa0;room. I did more than 50 mock interviews until he overcame his fear. These started with him only managing a line of dialogue before crumbling. Eventually we built up, bit by bit. It is possible to overcome this with practice. <strong>Isobel Brown</strong></p> <p>\u2022 Have an open and honest conversation about his fears, future and what he would like to do. It depends whether he is driven to succeed or if he\u2019s quite happy to coast along. If he wants to do more, this fear needs to be dealt with at the source. Exactly what is causing the anxiety?

If you find yourself in an interview where someone is being rude or difficult or is trying to humiliate you, view that as a sign of what the company is like.

Now I need to find a new arrangement</h2> <p><strong>I\u2019ve been at the same company for many years \u2013 almost straight from university \u2013 in the music industry managing rights for artists and songwriters. I am as senior as I can be (it\u2019s a small business) and have been for a while. I know I need to move on, I just can\u2019t think where to go.</strong></p> <p><strong>I check jobs sites for opportunities in the industry, but they are usually more specialised and either a bit more junior or a lot more senior (I get the impression my counterparts in larger companies and the major labels are promoted internally).&#xa0;I\u2019m also a terrible networker and peers often don\u2019t know who I am or how much responsibility I have. </strong></p> <p><strong>Contracts and licences are something I draft and negotiate regularly.

Is there a job for me outside the music industry?</strong></p> <p><strong>Jeremy says</strong></p> <p>People who stay with the same, smallish company for a long time and progress as far as they can tend not to have clear titles and job descriptions that make job hunting easy. Their roles evolve around them and become defined by whoever is doing them rather than the other way round. This makes finding equivalent roles elsewhere more difficult.</p> <p>Put aside, at least temporarily, any mental rehearsal of your transferable skills and instead do a bit of blue sky, unfettered speculation. Take your \u201cliterary and creative side\u201d, for example, which you come close to dismissing as \u201cwishful thinking\u201d. Please don\u2019t: it may be a long shot but it\u2019s not an impossibility. Try thinking backwards from your ideal job, then see if you can \u201cretro fit\u201d your credentials for doing it. (At your stage in life, experience can be at least as highly valued as formal qualifications.) Then pursue that goal with obsessive perseverance.</p> <p><strong>Readers say </strong></p> <p>\u2022 Experience drafting contracts and licences, handling data and managing royalties are all skills that would immediately transfer to the publishing industry. This could be music publishing or, if you prefer a bigger change, academic publishing or fiction publishing. Experience and knowledge of copyright is key rather than qualifications (in my experience). <strong>ScareBear</strong></p> <p>\u2022 I work in the same industry and had a similar experience.

  "<p>I spent my formative years in Chapeltown, Leeds. We called it the ghetto. You had a lot of people with no social or economic mobility, and tensions between different communities. In 2011, I saw my friend get murdered; he was shot in the face. It was a horrible time in my life where I was looking for role models, father figures. I found them in the park, at the exercise bars.</p> <p>Calisthenics describes any form of bodyweight training, from familiar moves like pull-ups, push-ups and sit-ups to moves you might see in Cirque du Soleil. Crazy stuff, like handstands at the top of a high bar. It\u2019s a real leveller. It doesn\u2019t matter how much money you\u2019ve got, or how much education you have: 10 push-ups are 10 push-ups to a billionaire or to somebody on benefits. It creates a real unity in communities. I\u2019ve been to parks all around the world and I can walk up to guys I\u2019ve never met before in my life, work out with them, and somebody will always ask if I\u2019m going to be there next week. That\u2019s what calisthenics is all about.</p> <p>It couldn\u2019t be more different to gyms, which are a bit like being in a lift, where nobody looks at each other even though they\u2019re sharing the same space. When you do a human flag \u2013 holding your whole body horizontal on a vertical pole, like a flag, stiff in the wind \u2013 people stop and look, or ask you how to do it. It has a wow factor.</p> <p>I love how calisthenics makes my body feel. I love how it makes my mind feel. I love the self-confidence that it brings. And I love that anyone can do it. I know children who do calisthenics, and I know 80-year-olds who do it.</p> <p>After my friend\u2019s death, I had a fitness park built in his memory, right by where he got shot. Now the whole community uses that park to work out together. There haven\u2019t been any shootings or stabbings since.</p> <h2>My weekend workout<br></h2> <p><strong>Favourite spot?</strong> Rootes Drive, London W10.<br><strong>Hours spent training?</strong> Between 4 and 6 a week.<br><strong>Favourite move?</strong> Handstand push-ups on top of a bar.<br><strong>Workout soundtrack?</strong> Any old-school hip-hop: Public Enemy, Dead Prez, Wu-Tang Clan.<br></p> <h2>Five ways to get started</h2> <p><strong>1</strong> All you need is to find somewhere that has a high bar and parallel bars with clearance all the way around them. You\u2019re much more likely to find these at your local park than in a gym.</p> <p><strong>2</strong> The moves you\u2019re going to be inspired by are things that you\u2019re not necessarily going to be able to try straight away. Keep it simple and build up strength with push-ups, pull-ups and tricep dips, or you risk injuring yourself.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/jul/09/my-workout-shirley-darlington-rowat-parkour\">My workout: Shirley Darlington-Rowat, parkour - \u2018It forces you to focus on the moment\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong>3</strong> Reps \u2013 repetitions \u2013 are what you use to build your body up.

  "<h2>Snapshot: Our cricket families\u2019 extended family </h2> <p>Cricket can be a notoriously family-unfriendly game \u2013 taking Dad (usually) away for the best part of a Saturday or Sunday. In 1985, the London team Millfields \u2013 gritty bachelors who were beginning to morph into families \u2013 faced the task of continuing to play and yet keep their families together.</p> <p>One club member, Paul, on a walking trip with his partner Chris along the edge of the North York Moors on an idyllic summer evening, looked down on a tiny cricket field and thought it would be wonderful if our team could play there. A man on a tractor in a nearby field answered Paul\u2019s inquiry by pulling a card out of his top pocket \u2013 he was the secretary of the Kildale cricket club.</p> <p>Thirty two years later, the Millfields families who made that first week-long tour playing village teams in and around the Eskdale valley near Whitby are still going there every July. That first tour was great for the cricketers, playing six games on the trot. But for the children, it was no exaggeration to say it was life changing. From the restrictions of their confined London lives, they couldn\u2019t believe they were allowed to run by themselves up the green lanes and to stay up impossibly late in pub gardens after post-match drinks and meals.</p> <p>They made friends among themselves \u2013 playing on the boundary, exploring each other\u2019s accommodation, the woods and moors, and, above all, the seaside at Whitby.</p> <p>The children looked forward to renewing their Yorkshire friendships each year and it was remarkable how they always immediately rekindled their once-a-year friendships.</p> <p>At the end of each tour, tears were shed and throughout each winter next year\u2019s \u201cYorkshire\u201d yearned for. Families grew, more children came along, some moved to other parts of the country but continued the yearly meet-up, some drifted away, and some families dissolved. Some of the original players have been given out by the great umpire in the sky.</p> <p>The tour helped to save and enhance a separated dad\u2019s relationship with his daughter, fighting through the family courts to establish the tour as a regular holiday. Her Yorkshire \u201cfamily\u201d became a regular part of her life.</p> <p>Now she goes with her partner and her own two small daughters, who, in their turn, are beginning to understand the excitement of playing with a gang of new friends, racing around in the freedom of the moors and dales, and a motley crew of friendly adults.</p> <p>Generations of cricketers have come and gone \u2013 the village hosts generously taking time off work to play, providing lavish Yorkshire teas and having a drink after the game.</p> <p>The key Millfields players now are the babies and toddlers who slept in tiny sleeping bags around the dining room floor at the last-night dinner on that first tour, and some who were not even born. This cricket tour has given a generation of young adults a network of friends and an extended family that now stretches across the country.</p> <p><em>Andrew Broadbent</em></p> <h2>Playlist: A biblical story \u2026 set along the Tyne</h2> <p><strong>You Belong to Me</strong></p> <p>\u201c<em>See the pyramids along the Nile / Watch the sunrise from a tropic isle /</em> <em>Just remember darling all the while / You belong to me\u201d</em></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://vimeo.com/36544415\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"345\" src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/36544415\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>Bob Dylan\u2019s You Belong to Me.</figcaption> </figure>   <p>It was years before I found out the name of this song. I first remember hearing it when I was about four. Dad picked me up from nursery and took me to the wholesalers in his butcher\u2019s van. It was winter, pouring with rain and pitch black. Dad sang all the way. He was singing as we crossed the bridge over the River Tyne into Newcastle.</p> <p>I felt so cosy, safe and loved there with him in the van as he sang.</p> <p>A few days later, at nursery, we heard the story of Moses and had to do a drawing of the story. I settled down to work. I drew the picture of Moses in a basket, hidden in the bullrushes by the Nile with \u2013 in the background \u2013 the iconic Tyne Bridge which, in my child\u2019s mind, were the pyramids along the Nile. My teacher asked about the picture and I explained that I had crossed the Nile with my dad in the van, a couple of days before.</p> <p>Dad also sang this song as we drove to my wedding and when he died I couldn\u2019t get it out of my head at his funeral: \u201c<em>Fly the ocean in a silver plane / See the jungle when it\u2019s wet with rain /Just remember till you\u2019re home again / Or until I come home to you / You belong to me.</em>\u201d</p> <p><em>Julie Leitheiser</em></p> <h2>We love to eat: Rhubarb Crunch pudding</h2> <p><strong>Ingredients</strong><br><em>100g self-raising flour</em><br><em>150g porridge oats</em><br><em>200g brown sugar </em><br><em>125g butter or margarine </em><br><em>Ground cinnamon</em><br><em>500g stewed rhubarb that has been allowed to cool</em></p> <p>Butter a 24cm flan dish.

It is a great favourite with my family, especially in the summer when rhubarb is plentiful. The recipe dates back to my school days when I was 11 or 12 and is written in a small blue exercise book in large, neat joined-up writing.</p> <p>It was the mid 60s and I was a day girl at a convent school in Surrey. I had a two-hour journey from our dormitory town, involving a bus, a steam train and then a mile walk at the other end.</p> <p>My father grew prodigious amounts of rhubarb at the bottom of our garden. After he had cut the rhubarb with sharp ivory-handled knife, we would wear the giant leaves perched on our heads and parade round the garden.</p> <p>I can picture myself, too, in my brown school uniform, with pig tails and beret, carrying sticks of rhubarb to school wrapped in newspaper. Returning at the end of the day by train, I carefully balanced the pudding I had made in a bag on my knee. I remember having to quickly shield the open bag because when we went through a tunnel, the sulphurous steam came in through the permanently open windows. It was a great relief when I managed to get home with my cooking intact, ready to be enjoyed by my family for tea.</p> <p><em>Bridget Hall </em></p> <h2>We\u2019d love to hear your stories<br></h2> <p>We will pay \u00a325 for every Letter to, Playlist, Snapshot or We Love to Eat we publish.

  "<p>At 8am, I wake up in my brother\u2019s old bedroom in Connecticut, on my father\u2019s 95th birthday. Downstairs, I find my brother sitting with his nine-month-old twin sons, looking broken. I stare at the empty chair where my father is normally to be found. I walk out of the room, and back in again. Two little identical heads track my movement.</p> <p>\u201cWhere is he?\u201d I ask.</p> <p>\u201cPlaying tennis,\u201d my brother says. \u201cWe should go and watch.\u201d It is, he assures me, a thing to see.</p> <p>Half an hour later, a small delegation arrives at the town courts: me, my brother, his four-year-old son and the middle one. On court number 3, we find four old men standing frozen in postures of readiness, as if posing for a daguerreotype.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6d03cc3be40b6667486a45e2bc82de31fa54a8e6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6d03cc3be40b6667486a45e2bc82de31fa54a8e6/1881_96_805_839/480.jpg\" alt=\"Illustration by Benoit Jacques\" width=\"480\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>\u201c40-15!\u201d one of them shouts.</p> <p>\u201cWhat?\u201d shouts my dad.</p> <p>This exchange is repeated several times. Eventually, my father serves. The game acquires surprising pace, given that nobody covers much ground. One player never moves at all, but whenever the ball encroaches on his personal space, his racquet shoots out to meet it. The point ends with a short lob loaded with such cruel back spin that it threatens to recross the net by itself. My brother was right: this is a thing to see.</p> <p>They play for another 40 minutes in 35-degree heat. At the end of the match, the other members of the foursome present my father with a trophy with a little tennis player on top. Then we all sing happy birthday. Players on adjacent courts, including a group of children having lessons, join in.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"42e8b99a778eee9e8981656c5311d4035f3ebba1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/42e8b99a778eee9e8981656c5311d4035f3ebba1/0_102_668_2212/302.jpg\" alt=\"Illustration by Benoit Jacques\" width=\"302\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>That afternoon, I drive my father to my sister\u2019s house for lunch.

The arrangements are identical to the celebration we planned for my father\u2019s 90th birthday, which was cancelled at the last minute \u2013 to his great relief \u2013 because it coincided with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hurricane-irene\">Hurricane Irene</a>. This year, the weather will not rescue him.</p> <p>As preparations mount, I\u2019m assigned the task of preventing the twins from killing themselves for an hour.

One of them tries to feed me a toy car.</p> <p>\u201cNo, thank you, George or John,\u201d I say. He is insistent. Out of the corner of my eye, I can just see his brother trying to pull the fireplace poker from its stand.</p> <p>The party is scheduled to start at 6pm. Our first guest, a neighbour of about my father\u2019s age, shuffles through the boathouse door at 5.30.</p> <p>\u201cI came early so I could get a good parking space,\u201d he says. Behind him, I can see his car sitting in the middle of the road.</p> <p>I pour the man a drink. Food is hurriedly ferried over from the house.

  "<p>\u201cIt\u2019s hard to know the difference between parenting and bullying,\u201d admits Matt, father of two and one of a growing number of parents seeking help to control what they see as unacceptable levels of anger towards their children. Matt is an articulate and successful self-employed businessman in his 40s. After he split up from their mother five years ago, his two sons, then 11 and 14, started to act up by answering back, skipping homework, drinking and taking drugs. It marked the start of a phase of intense anger for Matt, who eventually sought help.</p> <p>\u201cI have on a few occasions grabbed my eldest son by the scruff of his neck and shouted in his face. I couldn\u2019t understand why they don\u2019t do what I want them to do. Even now they make me question my skills as a parent.\u201d</p> <p>He\u2019s not alone.</p> <p>Over two decades, Mike Fisher has seen first-hand the effect of anger on children and their parents. Since setting up the <a href=\"http://www.angermanage.co.uk/\" title=\"\">British Association of Anger Management</a> in 1999, he has worked with tens of thousands of people, helping them to manage and understand their anger. For the past 13 years he has also delivered one-day workshops specifically aimed at parental anger, for Ealing council in west London. The course is always heavily oversubscribed.</p> <p>\u201cWe always have to turn people away and put them on a waiting list for the next one,\u201d says Kate Subanney, Ealing\u2019s parent commissioner, whose idea it was to get Mike involved.</p> <p>The parents she sends his way have all been referred to her by social services, the NHS, police, or solicitors, but Mike is quick to dispel any assumption that they come from one demographic. \u201cI\u2019d say at least 20% are middle-class parents and are particularly well-educated and affluent. Yet social services are involved. It really is across the board.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Children are bored out of their skulls by real life. Meaning they are becoming less and less cooperative</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>What is the atmosphere like at the beginning of his courses? \u201cThe parents are often apprehensive, scared, and suspicious. They feel like failures. We all assume that other parents are better than us, they are more equipped. But when people come to these courses, and they start hearing each other\u2019s stories, they realise we\u2019re all challenged with the same things.\u201d</p> <p>The parents are there because the stakes are high: unless they work on their anger, their children could be taken away. Or they have to learn how to control their anger before they are allowed to see their children at all. I imagine, in this context, that Mike has heard some shocking things. \u201cWe don\u2019t go into what goes on behind closed doors. We only get a tenth of the story, if we\u2019re lucky,\u201d he says.</p> <p>There is a taboo attached to parental anger \u2013 when Ealing council advertised Mike\u2019s courses as Anger Management for Parents, hardly anyone showed up. \u201cThere is too much shame. We had to rename it Understanding Anger in Parents,\u201d says Mike.</p> <p>But we know anger is there. With depressing regularity, angry parents pushed to their limits make the news. But, as Mike says, non-fatal episodes of anger cause long-term damage too. According to him, anger is the number one threat to not just our health but also the wellbeing of the 18.7 million families in Britain. Does he think the problem is getting worse? Are we getting angrier?</p> <p>\u201cDefinitely.\u201d</p> <p>But why?</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It\u2019s hard for British parents to own up to their own feelings ... we resort instead to shaming and blaming the child</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cThe most common theme in my parenting classes is that the biggest trigger for anger is children\u2019s lack of co-operation,\u201d Mike says. \u201cBut we\u2019re living in a world of information overload. Children have access to incredible information, such as social media and apps. It\u2019s instant gratification and just another distraction from being present. That can have a catastrophic effect on children. They are consumed by social media and games, staying up later and becoming preoccupied. They are bored out of their skulls by real life. Meaning they are becoming less and less cooperative. And parents are getting angrier about it every year.\u201d</p> <p>Part of the reason that parents get so angry is lack of emotional articulacy. \u201cIt is hard for British parents to own up to their own feelings. There\u2019s a lack of education around it. So I don\u2019t have parents actually telling a child that they feel angry or scared or vulnerable. When we\u2019re running late, tired or stressed, instead of telling our children how we feel, we resort instead to shaming and blaming the child.\u201d</p> <p>So parents are guilty of projecting their own stresses on to their children? \u201cExactly. And we\u2019re living in a world getting more stressful all the time. There\u2019s no opportunity for peace and quiet because of the nature of our lifestyles and environments. If we don\u2019t know how to manage it, it all gets projected. People dump on their children all the time.\u201d</p> <p>Despite the explosion of online emotional sharing, Mike thinks that fundamentally, the British stiff upper lip remains embedded in our psyche. \u201cWe hold on to our resentment, we hold on to our anger \u2013 we see the inside and just act it out.\u201d</p> <p>Is parenting idealised to the point that people are doomed to fail and then get furious about it? \u201cAs a culture, there is something about doing things well that we really value. It feeds our confidence or self-esteem, so we strive for perfection. When we don\u2019t achieve that we blame our children.\u201d</p> <p>He makes it clear that once people become parents, they are unwittingly drawn into an invisible, tangled web of competition with not just their partner but also their peer group and their own past. \u201cOne of the reasons parents put themselves under too much pressure is because of the way they were brought up. Either they don\u2019t want to parent their children the way they were, so they overextend themselves and over-compensate. Or their parents were brilliant and people try to match that, which can be competitive too.\u201d</p> <p>Plus, there\u2019s another strain on parents\u2019 stretched resources. Mike asks me to imagine that we are married with a child. \u201cLet\u2019s say that you seek perfection in your parenting. And I\u2019m a relaxed parent. Think about the pressure you\u2019re putting me under.</p> <p>\u201cAs kids get older, parents might find that they are better or worse equipped to deal with their children. For example, I might be better equipped to handle them when they are babies, but you might be better when they are teenagers. The combative nature of that imbalance affects the health of the family system. Not to mention competing against our peers.\u201d</p> <p>Mike is careful not to demonise people who get angry with their children. \u201cI feel honoured to be working with them. And you have to remember, when people are angry they just care too much. They\u2019re deeply sensitive, and they get frustrated. Some of the nicest people I\u2019ve ever met have been my clients.\u201d</p> <p>The problem is, being nice doesn\u2019t seem to be enough of a safeguard when it comes to our children.</p> <p><em>For more information, go to </em><a href=\"http://www.angermanage.co.uk/\" title=\"ww\"><em>angermanage.co.uk</em></a></p> <h2>Angry? Try some of Mike\u2019s techniques<br></h2> <p>1. Try to cue your child in when you\u2019re feeling angry. Communicate your vulnerabilities to them, let them know what\u2019s going on with you. That\u2019s what I call clean anger, and it\u2019s much easier to understand.</p> <p>2. If you do get angry, apologise. So many parents don\u2019t, yet they expect their own children to. Try to let them know what happened and why.</p> <p>3. Listen to your children \u2013 you don\u2019t always know better. Perhaps they do have a point. Perhaps they don\u2019t need to do what you want, immediately.</p> <p>4. Use an anger journal \u2013 it\u2019s a way of letting the anger have a space so you don\u2019t have to carry it all the time.</p> <p>5. Get support. Reach out to your friends, other parents, people who can help. Don\u2019t try to do it on your own. Isolation can make things worse.</p>",
  "<p>My husband and I and our 7 month-old baby arrived in California last week for an extended stay. We are sharing parental leave and it\u2019s his turn to take over. My work happens to bring me back to my home state, so we are making the most of it, starting with a little holiday in the Napa Valley wine region. Driving here from the coast north of San Francisco, I am struck by the dry, golden grass-covered rolling hills. Most of the area we drive through is agricultural. We go by grazing beef cattle and dairy cows and chicken caravans for facilitating free-ranging before we pass olive groves and finally vineyards. All along the way, the wide open roads are lined with wild fennel with feathery leaves and asterisk-like yellow flowers filling the air with their heady anise scent.</p> <p>Wild fennel is really a weed \u2013transferred easily on shoes and hooves \u2013 that has invaded this area of California the same way it has invaded the British isles. Wild fennel can be found in Britain along waterways and hedges, and now is the time it shines. I have long loved what its flavour does when paired with wine, so it is reassuring to see the two growing alongside each other here in Napa. The fig is having a moment now too, and roasted figs in red wine with fennel tastes as good as it looks. I choose ripe black figs with deep ruby and yellow-flecked centres, then drown them in a red wine that I like to drink, finishing them with a constellation of bright sunny fennel pollen.</p> <p>Fig ice-cream is another of my favourites. Using a generous amount of fruit gives it that gooey gelato texture and the popping of the seeds is really satisfying. These recipes work together, so that you can make the roasted figs one day and serve them on their own with creme fraiche, or let them cool down and puree them up to be made into a delicious ice-cream. My favourite is to make them twice and serve warm roasted figs over the frozen figgy ice-cream.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"ead64fdc465aab4989894edb461620821f620923\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ead64fdc465aab4989894edb461620821f620923/0_130_6750_4050/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Wild fennel and red wine roasted figs\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Ripe black figs, drowned in red wine and finished with a constellation of fennel pollen.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kristin Perers/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>Wild fennel and red wine roasted figs</strong></h2> <p><strong>Serves 4-6</strong><br>10 ripe black figs<br>100g raspberries<br>150g red wine<br>50g caster sugar<br>2 fronds wild or cultivated fennel leaves<br>Honey<br>2-4 wild fennel heads full of yellowpollen</p> <p><strong>1 </strong>Preheat the oven to 200C/400F/gas mark 6.

Slice the figs in half through the tail and stem, then put in your baking dish, cut-side facing up. Scatter with the raspberries and pour over the red wine.

  "<p>The government adviser who recommended re-starting offshore processing in Nauru and Manus Island has <a href=\"https://uploads.guim.co.uk/2016/09/03/VFST_Statement_Nauru_Manus_1_September_2016.pdf\">urged ministers to abandon the policy</a> and bring refugees to Australia before more kill themselves.</p> <p>Paris Aristotle, who has advised successive governments on refugee policy, said if refugees were left on the two islands it was \u201chighly likely that many more men and women will express their despair by attempting to harm and kill themselves\u201d.</p> <p></p> <p>Aristotle, the executive director of the <a href=\"http://www.foundationhouse.org.au/\">Victorian foundation for survivors of torture</a>, said: \u201cWe also hold grave concerns that children and young people in Nauru will respond in the same ways,\u201d adding that neither PNG nor Nauru could offer refugees a safe long-term future.</p> <p>\u201cImproving conditions and services in PNG and Nauru will not prevent this [continuation of self-harm].</p> <p>\u201cAn effective and sustainable response must involve the option of resettlement in countries including Australia which offer the opportunity for refugees to become integral members of society, to live in security and to participate in the economic, social and cultural life of their new homes.\u201d</p> <p>Aristotle, along with Michael L\u2019Estrange, Sir Angus Houston, sat on the 2012 <a href=\"http://artsonline.monash.edu.au/thebordercrossingobservatory/files/2015/03/expert_panel_on_asylum_seekers_full_report.pdf\">Expert Panel on Asylum Seekers</a>, that recommended to the Gillard Labor government, along with 21 other recommendations, the re-opening of offshore detention camps on Nauru and Manus as part of \u201ccomprehensive regional network\u201d.</p> <p>However, many of the report\u2019s other key recommendations designed to complement offshore processing have not been implemented \u2013 including those to lift Australia\u2019s humanitarian intake to 27,000 (currently 13,750), and to pursue stronger co-operative agreements with countries such as Malaysia and Indonesia.</p> <p>In his current statement, Aristotle argued that the old defence of offshore processing \u2013 that it served as a deterrent to irregular boat journeys to Australia and thereby saved lives at sea in Australian waters \u2013 was no longer valid.</p> <p>\u201cAustralia, Indonesia and other nations have increased their capacity to respond to irregular migration,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cTo ensure this can be sustainable we must also build a regional system based on established human rights principles, which aims to ensure that asylum seekers are protected properly in countries of first asylum or transit, are processed fairly, and, for those found to be refugees, are afforded timely settlement outcomes.\u201d</p> <p>However, Aristotle said, before a long-term regional resettlement framework could be established, the current abuses needed to be addressed.</p> <p>\u201cThe immediate imperative is that Australia acts swiftly to change the present policy settings that are inflicting serious harm.\u201d</p> <p>Australia\u2019s offshore processing camps on PNG\u2019s Manus Island and Nauru have come under sustained pressure almost since they were re-opened in 2012 over systemic abuses, violence (including the murder by guards of one asylum seeker, Reza Barati), sexual assault of women and children, and catastrophic rates mental illness, self-harm and suicide attempts.</p> <p>In April, Iranian refugee Omid Masoumali publicly doused himself in petrol and set himself alight on Nauru in protest at conditions. After critical delays in care and in moving him to a hospital off the island, he died in Brisbane.</p> <p>The camps have been condemned as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2016/may/18/australias-indefinite-detention-of-refugees-illegal-un-rules\">illegal, arbitrary and indefinite detention</a> by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/nov/26/un-refugee-agency-condemns-australias-offshore-detention-regime\">numerous arms of the United Nations</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2015/nov/10/un-countries-line-up-to-criticise-australias-human-rights-record\">dozens of other national governments</a>, and the <a href=\"https://www.humanrights.gov.au/news/stories/new-report-experts-reveal-alarming-impact-detention-children\">Australian Human Rights Commission</a>.</p> <p>Pressure has been particularly acute since the publication by The Guardian last month of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/series/nauru-files\">the Nauru Files</a> - more than 2000 leaked incident reports from that island that detailed systemic abuses, sexual violence against women and children, almost-daily reports of self-harm, and a culture of impunity for perpetrators of abuse.</p> <p>The overwhelming majority of those forcibly sent to Nauru and Manus have been found to be refugees, that is, they have a \u201cwell-founded fear of persecution\u201d, are legally owed protection, and cannot be returned to their homeland.</p> <p>Of the men on Manus who have had their asylum claims assessed, <a href=\"http://www.aph.gov.au/About_Parliament/Parliamentary_Departments/Parliamentary_Library/pubs/rp/rp1516/Quick_Guides/Offshore\">98% have been found to be refugees</a>.

  "<p>As the Festival of Dangerous Ideas kicked off at the Sydney Opera House on Saturday morning, the mood in the Utzon Room was decidedly bleak.

In another departure from the usual refugee policy talkfest, the audience was invited to put the panel\u2019s ideas to the test in facilitated workgroups, come up with potential solutions of their own, and present the ideas they had come up with themselves to the larger assembly. </p> <p>It was in this environment that new ideas began to emerge. One group, tasked with breaking the feedback loop between political leadership and popular opinion, proposed sophisticated, large-scale marketing campaigns and the delightful prospect of a \u201cRefugee Wants a Wife\u201d reality TV show to change refugees\u2019 public image. Another, eschewing the media entirely, flagged more direct proposals such as pressuring politicians to visit offshore centres themselves and speak face-to-face with the people they\u2019re detaining, or using virtual reality to give regular people an idea of what life on Nauru and Manus is like. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/may/27/cruelty-to-asylum-seekers-dressed-up-as-compassion-is-the-scandal-that-bedevils-australia\">Cruelty to asylum seekers dressed up as compassion is the scandal that bedevils Australia | Antony Loewenstein</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Representatives of Maurice Blackburn floated soliciting corporate sponsors to take on refugee work placements to give refugees a chance to live and work in the community, and Australians the opportunity to meet them first-hand. A fourth group came up with rebranding Australia Day as \u201cOpen Door Day\u201d and normalising the practice of experiencing a suburb you don\u2019t normally frequent, as a way of easing people\u2019s insecurities around multiculturalism.</p> <p>But the most well-received idea came at the end, and addressed the concerns Marr raised at the opening: commissioning research to actually understand how to change people\u2019s minds on a political issue. There was a common acknowledgement that unless the refugee movement stopped talking to itself about itself and reached people outside its own bubble, its capacity to bring about lasting change was limited.</p> <p>That, perhaps, was the most valuable thing to come out of the forum. The act of inviting people to actively contribute to the movement, rather than sit back and support the cause on social media, did more to excite attendees than the prospect of sitting through another speech from a refugee expert. If experiments such as these get similar receptions, David Marr may have less to despair about than he supposes.</p>",

  "<p>\u201cIf one thing positive came out of this trip\u201d, Danish MP Johanne Schmidt-Nielsen said in the final hours of her visit to Australia to learn about the country\u2019s immigration detention system, \u201cit was that again the world can see that in a country where critical eyes and ears are not allowed, it\u2019s obvious that something is being hidden\u201d.</p> <p>The carefully worded missive was Schmidt-Nielsen\u2019s parting shot as she and five parliamentary colleagues from across Denmark\u2019s political spectrum ended <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/30/danish-delegation-visit-to-nauru-australian-detention-centre-refused-visas\">their fact-finding mission on Australia\u2019s offshore detention regime.</a></p> <p>It didn\u2019t quite end up where the six had hoped.

That is not correct. We do not hold them there.\u201d</p> <p>Denmark has developed a particular interest in Australia\u2019s policies for asylum seekers. The last election witnessed the rise to prominence of the Danish People\u2019s party, a hard-right group that is aggressively against immigration, particularly Muslims. The conservative government in Denmark doesn\u2019t have a working majority. They\u2019re heavily reliant on the DPP and several smaller parties to retain power. </p> <p>And the DPP\u2019s views on immigration have had them encouraging the government and the public to turn to a place infamous for its hardline policies: Australia.</p> <p>So in secret, and without the knowledge of the Danish public, the 29-member parliamentary committee that examines immigration in Denmark began to discreetly make inquiries about visiting Australia and Nauru to understand how the offshore detention system worked.</p> <p>This was almost a year ago. Things appeared to be going smoothly, and Australia was incredibly welcoming. It was an opportunity to show the world that its policies were working, and were gathering interest globally.</p> <p>The Nauruan government had given every indication it was finalised and prepared. They had provided a formal program of their tour. It listed meetings with the secretary for multicultural affairs, Barina Waqa, and the deputy secretary for refugee status determination, Shyla Vohra. A formal tour was planned for the Regional Processing Centre, and a bus was organised to take them from site to site.</p> <p>But <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/aug/10/the-nauru-files-2000-leaked-reports-reveal-scale-of-abuse-of-children-in-australian-offshore-detention\">when the Guardian reported on the Nauru files</a>, which highlighted devastating trauma and abuse inflicted on children held in offshore detention in the largest cache of leaked documents released from inside its immigration regime, there was renewed attention to the criticism of Australia\u2019s detention system. It coincided with the secret trip finally being disclosed last week by the Danish radio station <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.radio24syv.dk/udvalgte-nyhedshistorier/danske-politikere-skal-besoege-udskaeldt-australsk-flygtningelejr/\">Radio24syv</a>. It generated a wave of controversy over the cost of the visit and the broader secrecy around it. Australians may be used to secrets, but the Danish are not. The trip would no longer be a discreet one.</p> <p>The increasing attention on Nauru and Australia, and some of the comments from Schmidt-Nielsen and Mark, appear to have signalled a turnaround from the Nauruan government. Why they would do so at such a late stage remains a mystery.</p> <p>\u201cIt was unacceptable and anti-democratic and I suppose everyone in the delegation was really surprised,\u201d Schmidt-Nielsen said. \u201cIf they didn\u2019t want us to go you would assume they would have denied access before we came all the way to Australia.\u201d<br></p> <p>Although it was frustrating for them, the trip was far from fruitless for at least some members. The delegation did have the opportunity to speak with a large number of high-profile Australian immigration officials. They also met the assistant minister for immigration, Alex Hawke, as well as organisations such as Save the Children and the Australian Human Rights Commission.</p> <p>It gave them the opportunity to try to understand more about the relationship between Australia and Nauru, and how the system worked.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/aug/10/the-nauru-files-2000-leaked-reports-reveal-scale-of-abuse-of-children-in-australian-offshore-detention\">The Nauru files: cache of 2,000 leaked reports reveal scale of abuse of children in Australian offshore detention</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cIt\u2019s still completely unclear for me who has actually got the legal responsibility for what is going on in Nauru,\u201d Schmidt-Nielsen said. \u201cIs it Australia? Is it the government of Nauru? Is it a shared responsibility, and if so what does that mean?\u201d</p> <p>It also gave them the opportunity to ask some tougher questions of the Australian officials.</p> <p>\u201cI asked about the Nauru files, several times. Every time the answer was \u2018all of the cases are being looked into and this is just a symptom of us having a really good reporting system\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>She continued: \u201cI said \u2018do you know of any cases where assault and child abuse were actually being investigated, someone being prosecuted?\u2019 And I have been asking that for a lot of time, and nobody has answered. One time when I asked, they said \u2018I don\u2019t know\u2019. That was the closest I got to an answer.\u201d</p> <p>Their responses were of equal surprise to Mark.</p> <p>\u201cYou can sit at one meeting and they will talk all about how much they care about children,\u201d he said. \u201cBut then you ask if they know if children have been raped or abused on Nauru, \u2018do you know if anything has happened to the people who did it?\u2019</p> <p>\u201cAnd then the government in Australia just says \u2018oh we don\u2019t know\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>It is unclear how much the Danish government will take on what the delegation learnt and saw in Australia for its own policies. In any case, while the parliamentary delegation was in Australia the Danish government made a surprise announcement; it would entirely cut the 500-person quota it placed on refugees for 2017. None would be resettled in Denmark next year.</p> <p>In a very short trip, the parliamentary delegation did see a rare glimpse of Australia\u2019s detention system \u2013 although perhaps not the one they hoped for.</p> <p>\u201cFor me it is just one big show,\u201d Mark said. \u201cA symbol to the world that says \u2018don\u2019t come here\u2019.\u201d</p>"
