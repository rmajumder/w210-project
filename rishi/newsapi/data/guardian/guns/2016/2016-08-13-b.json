  "<p>Donald Trump announced last week that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/12/donald-trump-obama-isis-founder-sarcasm\" title=\"\">Barack Obama was the \u201cfounder of Isis\u201d</a> and its \u201cmost valuable player\u201d. Earlier he had <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2016/aug/10/trump-clinton-second-amendment-2016-campaign-live\" title=\"\">hinted</a> that gun activists might want to assassinate Hillary Clinton to prevent her appointing liberal justices to the Supreme Court. In Britain, meanwhile, calls for the moderation of violent political language after the death of Jo Cox have not resulted in much reduction of the gleeful talk of \u201cstabbings\u201d and \u201ctraitors\u201d, and did not discourage Nigel Farage from exulting that the Brexit vote had been won \u201cwithout a shot being fired\u201d. In what some call an era of \u201cpost-truth politics\u201d, public discourse seems more abusive and angry, and further from the ideal of reasoned conversation about social goods, than ever before. Is our political language broken?</p> <p>Well, people have been complaining about the corruption of political language since political language existed. Confucius warned that a ruler should use the correct names for things, or social catastrophe would result. <a href=\"https://www.mtholyoke.edu/acad/intrel/orwell46.htm\" title=\"\">Orwell lamented</a> that political language in his time was \u201cdesigned to make lies sound truthful and murder respectable, and to give an appearance of solidity to pure wind\u201d. And the era of the \u201cwar on terror\u201d gave rise to a whole new constellation of what I call Unspeak: carefully engineered phrases designed to smuggle in a biased point of view and shut down thought and argument \u2013&#xa0;like \u201cwar on terror\u201d itself.</p> <p>Nor is flat-out lying in politics anything new. There is a marvellous 18th-century pamphlet usually attributed to John Arbuthnot, friend of Swift and Pope and founder of the Scriblerus club. It describes a yet-to-be-written book, <em>The Art of Political Lying</em>, in which the author will show \u201cthat the People have a Right to private Truth from their Neighbours ... but that they have no Right at all to Political Truth\u201d.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Perhaps what feels new to us now is the shamelessness of the lying, and the barefaced repeating of a lie</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The coinage \u201cpost-truth politics\u201d, indeed, implies that there was once a golden age of politics in which its elevated practitioners spoke nothing but perfect truth. The sun never dawned on such a day. But perhaps what feels new to us now is the shamelessness of the lying, and the barefaced repeating of a lie repeatedly debunked. Arbuthnot cautioned that the same lie should not be \u201cobstinately insisted upon\u201d, but he did not live to see this strategy work so brilliantly during the EU referendum, with the Leave campaign\u2019s claim that we sent <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/reality-check/2016/may/23/does-the-eu-really-cost-the-uk-350m-a-week\" title=\"\">\u00a3350m a week to the EU</a>.</p> <p>Shameless, too, was the haste with which this lie, having done its work, was disowned on the morning of the referendum result. It was a \u201cmistake\u201d, muttered Nigel Farage, before carefully lowering his snout back into the EU trough that continues to pay his MEP\u2019s salary. This rather called to mind Paul Wolfowitz\u2019s candid admission that the issue of Saddam\u2019s alleged WMD was chosen as the justification for the Iraq war <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/2945750.stm\" title=\"\">\u201cfor bureaucratic reasons\u201d</a>. The surprise, perhaps, is that you can show how the magic trick works, and people still believe it next time.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"35de0fbde6281d92567dd055e117cd8a77b46c70\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/35de0fbde6281d92567dd055e117cd8a77b46c70/0_7_5173_3103/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Champion of \u2018free speech\u2019: Donald Trump at a campaign rally last week.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Champion of \u2018free speech\u2019: Donald Trump at a campaign rally last week.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Evan Vucci/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Not so long ago it was \u201csoundbites\u201d that were thought to be corrupting political debate by reducing complex ideas to slogans. The 1988 US presidential election was called the \u201csoundbite election\u201d by some commentators, the most famous example being George HW Bush\u2019s promise: \u201cRead my lips: No new taxes.\u201d (Two years later Bush agreed to a bipartisan budget that did increase taxes.) It was a mysteriously brilliant piece of verbal engineering. Why would you have to read Bush\u2019s lips when you could hear what he was saying on the TV? But the surprising image and arresting rhythm made it stick.</p> <p>Soundbites and slogans (\u201cTake Back Control\u201d) still work. Trump, too, has a conventional campaign slogan: \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d. (Great how, exactly? By doing what? Don\u2019t ask.) But he gets most publicity for his antic, apparently off-the-cuff remarks that rhetorically perform an absence of rhetoric. His real genius might be read as a satirical absolutism about the first amendment. If speech is genuinely free, there should be no consequences to speech whatsoever. And, to the mystification of the commenting class, this is what Trump repeatedly finds to be the case.</p> <p>After the media furore surrounding Trump\u2019s claim that Obama founded Isis, he <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/12/sarcasm-trump-obama-isis-cnn\" title=\"\">tweeted</a>: \u201cTHEY DON\u2019T GET SARCASM?\u201d Thus he rows back from any outrageous claim dreamed up by a brain that works like a cleverly programmed internet meme-generator. \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d he says, all innocence, \u201cthat\u2019s what some people are saying.\u201d (No one was before he did.) Yet the idea Obama is the founder of Isis will stick in at least some voters\u2019 minds come polling day, as will the imaginary Mexican wall (though they will probably have forgotten its \u201cbig beautiful door\u201d) \u2013 just as the \u201c\u00a3350m a week for the NHS\u201d promise did for many Leave voters.</p> <p>Trump is not a perversion of the tradition of political campaigning; he is the logical culmination of it. It doesn\u2019t matter what you say, if it helps you get elected. Trump is not a liar, exactly, but a bullshitter. According to the <a href=\"https://philosophynow.org/issues/53/On_Bullshit_by_Harry_Frankfurt\" title=\"\">canonical definition by the philosopher Harry Frankfurt</a>, a liar still cares about the truth because he wants to conceal it from you. A bullshitter, on the other hand, simply doesn\u2019t care what is true at all.</p> <p>Trump is merely the most energetic current exploiter of a fact that modern politicians have long known: the media is broken, and you can mercilessly exploit its flaws to your own benefit. (That, after all, is what \u201cspin doctors\u201d are for.) If you repeat a lie often enough, then that claim becomes the story, and it\u2019s what most people remember. And a structural confusion between \u201cimpartiality\u201d and \u201cbalance\u201d undermines the mission to inform of institutions such as the BBC. To be impartial would be to point out untruths wherever they come from. But to be \u201cbalanced\u201d is to have a three-way between a presenter and two economists on opposite sides of some question. Never mind that one economist represents the views of 95% of the profession and the other is an ideologically blinkered outlier: the structure of the interview itself implies to the audience that the arguments are evenly divided.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Social media is less a conversation than it is a virtually distributed riot of 'happy firing'</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>In the age of social media, moreover, dubious political claims are packed into atomised fragments and attract thousands of enthusiastic retweets, while the people who help to redistribute them are unlikely ever to see a rebuttal that comes later or in someone else\u2019s timeline. We\u2019ve all moved on.</p> <p>Social media is less a conversation than it is a virtually distributed riot of \u201chappy firing\u201d (a term for the celebratory shooting of assault rifles into the sky). That lies can go viral more quickly than the truth is another old observation. In 1710 Jonathan Swift wrote: \u201cFalsehood flies, and the Truth comes limping after it.\u201d But what is certain is that Twitter and Facebook now help it fly faster and further than ever before.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"75adb12b31b1064ef306f24b5dbfd6386d3bde7d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/75adb12b31b1064ef306f24b5dbfd6386d3bde7d/0_0_3500_2320/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Nigel Farage proved the power of powerful slogans and images during the EU referendum campaign.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"663\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Nigel Farage proved the power of powerful slogans and images during the EU referendum campaign.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Philip Toscano/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Because attention is the currency of social media, public figures are incentivised to use outrage to vie for visibility, which further coarsens the public discourse \u2013 as when the American shock-journo <a href=\"http://www.anncoulter.com/columns/2016-08-10.html\" title=\"\">Ann Coulter lately defended Trump</a> by calling him a \u201cvictim of media rape\u201d who is being blamed for \u201cwearing a short skirt\u201d. Any such outburst these days, along with the wave of overt post-Brexit racism in Britain, may be defended as a healthy refusal to kowtow to \u201cpolitical correctness\u201d, a term that originally denoted the careful use of language so as not to needlessly upset people, and now just means common decency.</p> <p>What, then, is to be done? The modern bullshitting demagogue succeeds because he says arresting and often amusing things that cut through the anomie of those who feel left behind by politics as usual. Exquisitely reasoned liberal conversation is exactly what turns those voters off. Lately it has been notable that Hillary Clinton, not previously considered the wittiest person in US politics, has used an impressive array of scripted zingers to put down her opponent. What the bullshitters do so well is define the rules of the game, so perhaps their opponents will have to play it at least to this extent, while trying to keep the moral high ground by still caring about what is true and what isn\u2019t.</p> <p>It\u2019s not an edifying thought, but if the insurgent right is to have its Trumps and its Farages, maybe the centre and the left need their own versions too.</p> <p><em>Steven Poole is the author of </em><a href=\"http://bookshop.theguardian.com/rethink-385383.html\" title=\"\"><em>Rethink: The Surprising History of New Ideas</em></a><em> (Random House Books)</em></p>",
  "<p>Every visitor to Glasgow must take a <a href=\"https://www.glasgow.gov.uk/index.aspx?articleid=19136\" title=\"\">tour round the city chambers</a>. Almost 130 years after its completion it remains one of the finest examples of Victorian civic architecture in the UK and you\u2019re advised to allot a couple of hours to your visit if you want to appreciate its splendour. It was opened by the old queen herself in 1888 and has lost none of its beauty since. It sits in George Square in the heart of the city and not long after you embark on your tour you will think that you have been here before.</p> <p>The city chambers has been cast as a handsome and silent star in dozens of Hollywood movies and UK drama productions where it conveys a time, place and an atmosphere in an instant. Last month, its presence in the BBC adaptation of Joseph Conrad\u2019s <em>The Secret Agent </em>enhanced the visual appeal of the series. The sweep of its artistic range possesses both the temporal and the spiritual. It performed a similar job in <em>An Englishman Abroad </em>where it represented the Kremlin and in <em>Heavenly Pursuits </em>where it became the Vatican.</p> <p>The city chambers also has more Carrara marble than the Vatican. This fact was relayed last week by Baillie Liz Cameron, one of Glasgow\u2019s best-known councillors, to a group of Fulbright scholars as she led them through the halls of her workplace. Ms Cameron, a bit of a city gem herself, also informed the Americans that she had written to the pope to tell him that Glasgow trumped his palace for Michelangelo\u2019s favourite marble and that she had extended him an invitation to see it for himself the next time he\u2019s in the city.</p> <p>The city chambers is also bound to feature in an eagerly awaited book about Glasgow by the journalist and author Alan Taylor that is soon to be published by Birlinn. The title of Taylor\u2019s book is <a href=\"http://www.birlinn.co.uk/Glasgow-the-autobiography.html\" title=\"\"><em>Glasgow: The Autobiography</em></a> and will feature the thoughts of hundreds of people who have lived in Glasgow or encountered it. It will include the observances of James Boswell and Samuel Johnson as well as those of a somewhat more edgy cast of lesser-known characters.</p> <p>Taylor, who relayed to me the story of the outstanding papal invitation, is one of those rare beasts: an Edinburgh man born and bred who doesn\u2019t get a nose bleed whenever he bides long in Glasgow. \u201cI couldn\u2019t have written this book about Edinburgh,\u201d he said. \u201cMuch as though I love Edinburgh, it simply doesn\u2019t have anything like the drama and human dynamism of Glasgow. This is a city that lives and talks at 100 miles per hour.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5ad5c64ba18e92342dffb5ed4f7ceb34aa0375c1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5ad5c64ba18e92342dffb5ed4f7ceb34aa0375c1/0_192_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A street performer pays the price for requesting help from the audience at the Edinburgh fringe.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A street performer pays the price for requesting help from the audience at the Edinburgh fringe.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Murdo Macleod/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Taylor will be appearing at the <a href=\"https://www.edbookfest.co.uk/the-festival/whats-on\" title=\"\">Edinburgh International Book festival</a> next weekend to talk about his work with Richard Holloway in a session that is already sold out. There will be much to discuss, not least the ageless rivalry between Glasgow and Edinburgh and the fact that while Edinburgh has been the subject of dozens of studies, there are no serious academic histories of Glasgow. Also sure to feature in the discussion is the revelation last week that the population of Edinburgh may be about to outstrip that of Glasgow by 2037 at the present rate of growth. According to the National Records of Scotland, <a href=\"http://www.edinburghnews.scotsman.com/news/edinburgh-population-to-grow-by-28-per-cent-1-3410407\" title=\"\">Edinburgh\u2019s population</a> will rise by more than 28% over 25 years, more than three times the rate for Scotland as a whole, to 618,978 in 2037. Meanwhile, Glasgow\u2019s will fall, thus suggesting that it is in danger of losing its status as Scotland\u2019s largest city.</p> <p>The figures don\u2019t actually take into account the fact that Glasgow\u2019s real population is more than 1.2m. This, though, was artificially reduced by massive relocation in the 1960s and 1970s to ease overcrowding within the city and successive boundary changes in the 1990s that were unkind to Glasgow. Thus, boutique local authorities such as East Renfrewshire were created that denuded Glasgow of revenue and territory. More than 2 million Scots of working age live within a one-hour commute of Glasgow and the city generates \u00a318bn in gross value added to the Scottish economy each year. Glasgow could function perfectly adequately by itself, but Scotland couldn\u2019t function without Glasgow. It is and will remain for a long time to come the nation\u2019s biggest and most important city.</p> <p>Yet it is grossly undervalued and underappreciated by the rest of the country. Every year since the SNP came to power in Scotland in 2007, Glasgow\u2019s block grant from Holyrood has been cut. And though Glasgow was one of only four out of 32 local authority areas to vote for Scottish independence in 2014, it remains curiously and grossly underrepresented in Nicola Sturgeon\u2019s Holyrood cabinet. The tiny, self-serving and utterly unrepresentative political and media elite that has mushroomed in the environs of Holyrood continues to revile and criminalise Glasgow with its discriminatory <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-36935900\" title=\"\">Offensive Behaviour at Football Act</a> and the eye-watering numbers of <a href=\"http://www.scotsman.com/news/police-continuing-to-use-inappropriate-stop-and-search-methods-1-4167325\" title=\"\">stop and searches</a> carried out on its young citizens by an out-of-control police authority.</p> <p>The huge gap between affluent and poor that exists within a seven-mile stretch of Glasgow has become something that these people mock. This is before they fob the city off with vapid promises of reducing inequality and increasing attainment. My city has suffered grievously from population manipulation and the failed social experiments of scientists, academics and politicians. Yet Scotland, while skimming off Glasgow\u2019s output and its capacity for hard, hard work has done little to alleviate the pain of its poor.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/mar/28/stop-targeting-football-fans-draconian-laws\">Stop targeting football fans with \u2018draconian laws\u2019, says campaign group</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In Edinburgh meanwhile, where this discussion of an important book about Glasgow will occur, the <a href=\"http://www.eif.co.uk/\" title=\"\">international festival</a> is taking place. The Scottish government pours millions each year into Edinburgh in an attempt to make it a 365-day-a-year festival city. For four weeks in August, it swells grotesquely with television executives, publishers and authors prattling about the future while plotting more ways to make money. Edinburgh has become a global theme park for frivolous self-gratification, a staging post in the global elite\u2019s gap year. As its town planners continue to drive a wrecking ball through its glorious and ancient cityscape they have also permitted it to become a city of froth and artifice: a 24-hour party city.</p>",
  "<p>What a difference a day makes. After the rain-sodden minor chords of Friday\u2019s opening day of the Rio 2016 athletics, the Olympic stadium was transformed on the second morning. With Usain Bolt, the world\u2019s lone through-the-roof athletic superstar due in town, the swooping stands of this ramped-up old football ground were re-cast into a fun, fizzy sun-drenched place, three-quarters full by noon and with a crackle of something authentically Olympian in the air.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/13/olympic-games-rio-athletics-100m-usain-bolt-justin-gatlin\">Usain Bolt arrives to lift the Rio fans but finds Justin Gatlin has the legs</a> </p> </aside>  <p>As Bolt emerged at 12.37pm to take to the blocks for his opening heat of these games, a huge rolling cheer erupted around the stands, a sound unlike anything heard so far. This was wilder, shriller, more to do with presence and stature, the pure event-glamour only Bolt brings to proceedings. He worked the crowd, shooting off into a practice start, then turning to applaud magisterially the Bolt-mania from the people craning from the bleachers.</p> <p>Everyone loves a star, just as everybody loves a little glimpse of something ultimate, some pure human white heat. There were huge cheers again as the face of the quickest man in history appeared on the big screen, followed by profound, gulping silence in the crouch for the gun.</p> <p>After which, the race itself was a bit of a stroll. Bolt stretched home in 10.07, slowed at the line, shook a few hands, then yawned off to do his media duties. His job was done here. Games on, his final wave to a gurgling crowd seemed to say. You may proceed, Rio 2016.</p> <p>A little sun helps with these things, as does the start of the weekend. Really, though, this was all about one man. This will be a final Olympics for the world record holder and two-time champion. The opportunity is there in the small hours of tomorrow morning to take a third gold in the prime event, the G-spot of any Games, those 35 perfect strides, during which the athletes are barely in contact with the ground beneath their feet, but which has always been held as a basic measure of human ultimacy.</p> <p>In Rio, Bolt\u2019s role as a kind of life raft for the Games themselves has seemed more profound than ever. He remains a cloudless superstar presence, providing a high-spec cover for the more addled and tarnished Olympic subplots. On the opening morning of heats in Rio, the battle with the American <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/jun/25/justin-gatlin-two-times-drugs-cheat-athletics-world-championships\">Justin Gatlin </a>once again fed into this narrative.</p> <p>So profound is the contrast in back story and manner with the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/jun/25/justin-gatlin-two-times-drugs-cheat-athletics-world-championships\">two-time doper Gatlin</a>, a conveniently charisma-free, thrillingly powerful 34-year-old warrior of the sprints, that it has been tempting for some to ramp up the comparison into some kind of ultimate battle of good and evil. Here comes Gatlin again, a slavering Orc pounding down the track in pursuit of our own fun, frisky, 6ft 5in Jamaican Bilbo Baggins.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2016/aug/13/rio-2016-athletics-womens-100m-final-mens-long-jump-live\">Rio 2016 athletics: women's 100m final and men's long jump final \u2013 live!</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The truth, of course, is more nuanced. Gatlin still disputes his first drug ban, imposed for taking medicine related to suffering attention deficit disorder. Earlier in the week his own team-mate, the swimmer Lilly King, had <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/10/lilly-king-unrepentant-calling-out-drug-cheats\">suggested he shouldn\u2019t be at these games at all</a>. Gatlin\u2019s response \u2013 \u201cI\u2019ve served that time\u201d \u2013 was cool, even quite astute, with its faint hints of something that goes beyond the track in America, into other realms of crime and punishment.</p> <p>Gatlin had run before Bolt in the second heat here, pounding his way to victory from lane eight, feet smacking the super-fast blue track, but slowing also at the end too. Yohan Blake, another prodigious Jamaican sprinter, also won his heat in a blur of compact, fast-twitch muscle.</p> <p>Bolt versus history, Bolt versus Gatlin, will remain the story. Bolt\u2019s presence alone, his charisma, his sheen of all-time star quality will continue to act as an elixir to all the bumps and bruises and noises off.</p> <p>As he disappeared down the tunnel the stadium took a breath, a little drunk on the spectacle. In the end Bolt might not be able to save the Olympics from itself. But for a morning in the Rio sunshine, it felt like he might just save a day or two before then.</p>",
  "<p>Whether he wins or loses the US presidency next November, Donald Trump has already come up with one of the defining slogans of 2016 \u2013 \u201cMake America great again\u201d.</p> <p>Trump\u2019s vision of an America in precipitous decline is all-encompassing. At home, he points to falling living standards for many Americans and the disappearance of well-paid manufacturing jobs.

Yet the fear of economic and geopolitical decline that Trump is capitalising upon is widely visible across the west. The coalition of frustrated working-class voters and nostalgic nationalists that the Republican has put together is uncomfortably reminiscent of the alliance that voted for Brexit in the UK.

This erosion of the west\u2019s privileged position in world affairs is creating new economic, geopolitical and even psychological pressures in both the US and the EU.</p> <p>The driving force of this change is the extraordinary economic development of Asia over the past 50 years. In 2014, the IMF reported that, measured in purchasing power, China is now the world\u2019s largest economy. The US had held this title since 1871, when it displaced the UK; now China is number one. The rise of China is just part of a broader shift of economic power towards Asia. The IMF reports that three of the world\u2019s four largest economies are now in Asia. China is first, the US is second, India third and Japan fourth.</p> <p>It is true that if you measure economies at current exchange rates the US is still the world\u2019s largest economy \u2013 and European nations also rise up the pecking order. But growing Chinese and Asian economic weight is demonstrable in many other ways. China is now the world\u2019s largest manufacturer and the largest exporter. It is also the world\u2019s largest market for vehicles, smartphones and oil \u2013 and the biggest single market for many western companies such as Daimler and KFC. But it is not just Mercedes and fried chicken that are being consumed in Asia. In 2012, for the first time in over a century, Asian countries spent more money on armaments and troops than European nations. The world\u2019s two largest arms importers are now India and Saudi Arabia.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jun/06/arab-states-almost-double-small-arms-imports-report\">Middle East states almost double small-arms imports</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Conventional economic theory holds that the growing wealth of Asia should be a boon to the economies of the west, since it offers new markets and sources of investment.

Economists call this the \u201cChina shock\u201d and the effects have been profound. By the end of 2008, the US had lost one third of its manufacturing jobs from peak and most of those had gone in the previous decade. Italy, whose industrial heartlands have suffered particularly badly from competition with Asia, has lost 25% of its industrial capacity since 2008. Researchers at Bocconi University in Italy have shown that across Europe it is the areas that have been hit hardest by <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2016/07/07/the-real-reason-the-u-k-voted-for-brexit-economics-not-identity/\" title=\"\">Chinese competition</a> that are most likely to move towards political parties advocating \u201cidentity-based nationalism\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1f94e90931cb1462547cf5f00f8c205cbdf2dea5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1f94e90931cb1462547cf5f00f8c205cbdf2dea5/0_162_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Detroit Michigan\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">With the decline of the American car industry Detroit in Michigan was one of the cities hardest hit by job losses.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Spencer Platt/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>China\u2019s increasing economic weight is also leading to tricky strategic and political choices for western nations.

A few months ago, Australia faced its own Hinkley Point moment when it <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/apr/29/australian-treasurer-overrules-sale-of-13-of-country-to-chinese-firm\" title=\"\">blocked a Chinese consortium</a> from buying a company that owns more than 1% of Australia\u2019s landmass. Since then, tensions between the Aussies and the Chinese have risen. A few days ago, the <em>Global Times</em>, a subsidiary of China\u2019s <em>People\u2019s Daily</em>, suggested that if the Australian navy joined the US in patrolling waters <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2016/jul/12/south-china-sea-dispute-what-you-need-to-know-about-the-hague-court-ruling\" title=\"\">claimed by Beijing </a>in the South China Sea, Australia would be \u201can ideal target to warn and strike\u201d.</p> <p>The shrill tone of such Chinese pronouncements underlines the fact that the shift in global economic power has not just altered attitudes in the west, it has also produced an increasingly assertive nationalism in Xi Jinping\u2019s China. Over the past year, Beijing has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jun/04/south-china-sea-us-warns-beijing-against-building-great-wall-of-self-isolation\" title=\"\">asserted its claims</a> in the South China Sea by building <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/oct/27/tensions-and-territorial-claims-in-the-south-china-sea-the-guardian-briefing\" title=\"\">artificial islands</a> across the ocean.

Hillary Clinton is regarded in Beijing as a dangerous hawk who would be likely to be more determined in pushing back against China\u2019s maritime claims. President Xi is a tough-minded nationalist, so a Clinton presidency would increase the chances of a clash in the Pacific between the US and China.</p> <p>Trump, by contrast, seems relatively uninterested in America\u2019s strategic role in the Pacific, but his vociferous protectionism has led him to propose swingeing tariffs on Chinese goods. Any such policy would be regarded as an act of economic warfare by Beijing.</p> <p>Either way, the era when globalisation seemed like a process that could create only common interests between China and the west is over. It is now giving way to an epoch that looks altogether darker and more dangerous.</p>",
  "<p>Friday 12 August: the opening of the grouse-shooting season, known to shooters as the Glorious Twelfth. This year, it arrived with some ironically glorious weather: perfect for guns alive to the beauties of the purple-clad heather moorland.</p> <p>I write \u201cironically\u201d because the cold and wet during the spring, when the grouse were breeding, means that there are precious few birds to be shot. Some moors have cancelled altogether, at severe financial loss to their owners. But grouse are like that: the population booms for a few years, then collapses. When conditions are right, this completely wild bird, which bursts suddenly over the guns, with a fast, jinking flight, is regarded as one of the supreme sporting challenges, hence the thousands of pounds aficionados around the world will pay to have a pop at it.</p> <p>For the moor owner and his staff, a whole year\u2019s work culminates in just a few days of shooting. The success of these days will determine whether the gamekeepers have jobs next year. They are under intense pressure to present a large number of grouse to the guns and while most estates are scrupulous in observing the law that protects the birds of prey that eat young chicks, one or two rogue keepers break the law. That\u2019s what conservation charities think, anyway, when protected birds such as sea eagles disappear and they may be right; it\u2019s hard to be certain, because of the difficulty of finding corpses over a vast terrain and difficult to prosecute. [See footnote.]</p> <p>These cases perpetuate the antipathy between moor owners and the public at large, dating at least to the mass trespass on the <a href=\"http://kindertrespass.com/index.asp?ID=137\">Duke of Devonshire\u2019s moor at Kinder Scout in 1932</a>.</p> <p>Obviously, the destruction of protected raptors is deplorable. And yet it illustrates an interesting point about the countryside. Because the magnificent sea eagle, otherwise the white-tailed eagle, Britain\u2019s largest bird of prey, hasn\u2019t lived in Scotland continuously; its numbers plummeted across Europe in the 19th century and died out in Scotland altogether. The sea eagles we now have were reintroduced in a programme that started in 1975. While many people would be thrilled to see one in the skies, they were a source of controversy in Suffolk when the idea of re-establishing them was mooted there some years ago. Farmers worried about their lambs. One person\u2019s natural marvel can be a threat to someone else\u2019s livelihood.</p> <p>More controversy will be on its way if rewilding takes hold. On the 23,000-acre <a href=\"http://www.alladale.com/\">Alladale Wilderness Reserve</a> in remote Sutherland, Paul Lister dreams of reintroducing wolves, as well as bear, lynx, wildcat and wild boar. Wolves would provide a natural solution to the deer problem; an overpopulation of red deer has nibbled much of the Highlands into a biodiversity desert. Any seedling that succeeds in pushing a leaf above ground in what used to be the Caledonian forest is immediately eaten. A wolf pack would give the deer a run for their money, but ramblers, determined to make the most of Scotland\u2019s right to roam, fear that they\u2019d have to put on a turn of speed too.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"40367517f26db908dfcacf87865ee52335f3c763\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/40367517f26db908dfcacf87865ee52335f3c763/0_81_2456_1473/1000.jpg\" alt=\"There are plans to reintroduce wolves in Sutherland; not all landowners welcome the move.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">There are plans to reintroduce wolves in Sutherland; not all landowners welcome the move.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Craig Jones / Barcroft Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>And few farmers are likely to welcome the return of a predator that was driven to extinction in the 18th century, precisely because of the toll it took of young animals. Perhaps, post Brexit, the CAP budget will be reprioritised, meaning that agriculture becomes more intensive in parts, using a panoply of new techniques, and wilder in others. But that\u2019s a big perhaps.</p> <p>One of the most successful reintroductions has been the<a href=\"http://www.chilternsaonb.org/about-chilterns/red-kites.html\"> red kite, after the first releases in the Chilterns</a> more than 20 years ago. Now a dozen may be in the sky at any time over the M40 in Oxfordshire, since the first releases in 1989. They\u2019re not the fearsome predators that they appear (and which the Victorians thought them): they eat carrion. One tried to snatch a pomeranian dog a couple of years ago but not necessarily to eat; they\u2019re known to like toys, not to mention, as Shakespeare reminds us, scraps of laundry, of the kind worn next to the skin: \u201cWhen a kite builds, look to lesser linen.\u201d Its foraging habits may encourage it to join urban foxes around the bins on city streets, not an attractive prospect to those who have done battle with gulls in coastal towns.</p> <p>Often, the rule of our delicately balanced countryside is that success for one species spells disaster for another. Grey squirrels, able to digest unripe nuts, out-eat their red cousins. Water vole numbers have collapsed since the escape or release of mink from fur farms. Throw a lump of bait into the upper waters of the Thames and you\u2019ll pull up a fistful of crayfish, but they\u2019ll be signal crayfish from North America; those brawny Yanks have reduced our white-tailed natives to endangered status. Hundreds of hedgehogs, descendants of those introduced in the 1970s to reduce garden slugs, have been removed from South Uist, where they were eating the eggs of wading birds. They were trapped and relocated. A more rugged approach has been adopted in New Zealand where the government hopes to eradicate all the country\u2019s rats, ferrets, stoats and feral cats and dogs in coming decades. Evolution didn\u2019t equip flightless birds such as the kiwi to survive them.</p> <p>Let\u2019s not get into badgers and the controversy over bovine TB. It\u2019s worth remembering, though, what they\u2019d do with those hedgehogs, lovingly transported form South Uist. Their strong claws can unroll a curled-up hedgehog, which then screams as its insides are torn out. Badgers aren\u2019t solely responsible for the hedgehog\u2019s precipitous decline but some blame lies with the well-meaning Badger Protection Act. For the countryside isn\u2019t a wilderness \u2013 humankind keeps the balance. Many wildflowers, for instance, only survive in combination with farming practices, whether the grazing of chalk downland or the turning of soil by the plough.</p> <p>Which brings us back to grouse moors. I visited one in Yorkshire and it was teeming with lapwings, plovers and curlews, as well as young grouse. Grouse moors don\u2019t have many foxes or stoats \u2013 the keepers see to that. Which produces ideal conditions for many species, along with the one that makes the income to pay for it: grouse. Whatever you think of shooting, that\u2019s worth bearing in mind.</p> <p><em>Clive Aslet is a former editor of </em>Country Life</p> <p>\u2022 Readers\u2019 editor\u2019s footnote: The number of rogue gamekeepers is a matter of controversy. <a href=\"http://www.crownoffice.gov.uk/media-site/media-releases/1188-second-conviction-in-scotland-by-vicarious-liability-for-wildlife-crime-against-wild-birds\">Successful prosecutions</a> of gamekeepers or, vicariously, of their employers, over deaths of birds of prey are rare. <a href=\"http://www.gov.scot/Publications/2015/09/6676/0\">Law-breaking</a> resulting in deaths of birds of prey is less so.

Now, according to priest-in-charge Tim Hughes, it regularly attracts a total of 500 people to its two Sunday services, which are characterised by loud rock music, chatty homilies rather than formal sermons, group prayer, and manifestations of God in the form of shaking or speaking in tongues.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/apr/18/evangelical-christians-social-action-revivify-church-brand\">How evangelical Christians are using social action to revivify church brand | Andrew Brown</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Before moving to Birmingham, Hughes, 39, and his wife Rachel spent 10 years at Holy Trinity Brompton, an ultra-evangelical church in west London known almost universally as HTB, which pioneered the famed <a href=\"http://uk.alpha.org/\">Alpha courses</a> and where Hughes was director of worship.

Evangelical churches have also been \u201cplanted\u201d in Norwich, Lincoln and Bournemouth. All have strong links with HTB, all are led by husband-and-wife teams, and all are aimed principally at students and young families. \u201cWe want to connect with 18-30s,\u201d said Hughes.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>If we only present the gospel in one particular way to one particular generation, people will vote with their feet</p> <footer> <cite>Ric Thorpe, bishop of Islington</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Ric Thorpe, another former HTB man who was appointed as bishop of Islington with special responsibility for \u201cchurch planting\u201d last September, aims to have 100 new worshipping communities in London by 2020. \u201cThere is a need to plant churches in new places to reach new people in new ways,\u201d he said.</p> <p>That the Church of England needs to reach new people is beyond question. The scale of its institutional atrophy was graphically illustrated by data earlier this year showing that church attendance was set to continue <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/feb/17/church-of-england-attendance-decline-30-years-general-assembly\">falling for another 30 years</a>. Today\u2019s figure of 18 people per 1,000 regularly attending church would drop to 10 per 1,000, with an 81-year-old eight times more likely to go to church than a 21-year-old.</p> <p>In an attempt to stem this apparently inexorable decline, Justin Welby, the archbishop of Canterbury, has launched the church\u2019s biggest evangelism drive in a generation, with the goal of a religious revival among young people who are less likely than any other age group to identify themselves as Christians.</p> <p>Welby, himself a former HTB man who was prepared for ordination by Sandy Millar, HTB\u2019s vicar until 2005, is optimistic that his drive will succeed. \u201cI think the tide is turning in this country. We are seeing many churches growing,\u201d he told Michael Gove in an <a href=\"http://www.spectator.co.uk/2015/12/the-tide-is-turning-in-this-country-justin-welby-interviewed/\">interview in the <em>Spectator</em></a> last December. In March, he told an evangelical gathering: \u201cI believe from the bottom of my heart that the long years of winter in the church, especially in the Church of England, are changing.

Since his appointment he has focused the church\u2019s energy and resources on an ambitious <a href=\"https://www.churchofengland.org/renewal-reform.aspx\">Renewal and Reform</a> programme to refashion it as an outward-facing evangelistic \u201cmission\u201d rather than an institution sliding gently into its dotage.</p> <p>A third of the way through his expected 10-year term at the church\u2019s helm, Welby faces a critical few years. \u201cWe have a golden window to change the church,\u201d one evangelical bishop told the <em>Observer</em>. \u201cIf we can\u2019t turn it round in that time, it\u2019s over.\u201d</p> <p>Some see parallels with Tony Blair\u2019s mission in the 1990s to drag the Labour party into the modern age. Except, say critics, rather than taking the church into the mainstream, as Blair did with Labour, the focus on evangelism risks placing the church firmly on the fringe, in the hands of zealots. Many among the clergy and in congregations are uncomfortable and distrustful of charismatic practices such as speaking in tongues. There is also a belief that the established church of the country should be broad and inclusive \u2013 even if that means a little fuzzy \u2013 rather than narrow and uncompromising.</p> <p>\u201cActually, the more apt comparison is with Corbyn and Momentum,\u201d said one critic. \u201cThe diehards become more and more frenzied, while everyone else looks on in total incomprehension \u2013 and in many cases are repulsed.\u201d</p> <p>With regard to church planting, advocates point to astonishing numbers. <a href=\"http://stpetersbrighton.org/\">St Peter\u2019s Brighton</a>, which started five years ago with 30 people, now claims to be 800-strong. <a href=\"http://www.stn.org.uk/\">St Thomas Norwich</a> holds five services on Sundays, and has grown from 50 to 450 attendees in two years. <a href=\"http://kxc.org.uk/\">KXC</a>, a church launched in 2010 in King\u2019s Cross, London, has 500 regular worshippers, nearly all in their 20s, says Thorpe.</p> <p>He drew a rough graph, showing the downward trajectory of the traditional congregation and the upward trajectory of the \u201cgrowing church\u201d. \u201cThe evidence suggests that the institutional church is in decline. But you have these two things happening at the same time: an ageing way of doing church is becoming less popular, but there\u2019s a new movement of young people particularly in situations of growth. If you draw those curves together, there will be a bottoming out,\u201d he said. Critics say attendance figures at new churches rarely represent genuine new growth, but are largely due to \u201csheep stealing\u201d \u2013 poaching existing members of other congregations \u2013 and attracting students looking for a new place to worship after leaving their \u201chome church\u201d. They also claim that the congregations of church plants do not reflect the demographics of their inner-city locations, but are overwhelmingly white, middle-class young professionals.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The ways in which [evangelicals] talk about God are fundamentally offputting. More people are turned off than turned on</p> <footer> <cite>Martyn Percy, dean of Christ Church, Oxford</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Although it may appear to be a grassroots phenomenon, church planting is a key part of Welby\u2019s strategy \u2013 and gets generous support. The allocation of church funds is a crucial way of effecting change in an institution whose running costs are about \u00a31bn a year (much of it going to cover its vast pensions liability). According to a senior source, \u201cmoney used to be handed over on a formulaic basis, and the dioceses could spend it how they liked. And the formula was perverse \u2013 if [church] attendances fell, you got more money. It was the wrong incentive structure.\u201d</p> <p>From January next year, funding will be allocated to two streams. One will go to poor areas, mostly deprived inner cities; the other for \u201cstrategic development\u201d, with church planting taking centre stage.</p> <p>Ric Thorpe said: \u201cWhat\u2019s changed is that [the church] is now saying, we want this money to go towards growth \u2013 which, when it\u2019s in decline, is a wise investment. In this new thinking, you\u2019ve got to demonstrate that you\u2019ve got a plan, that you\u2019re putting [funding] to good use, that it\u2019s not going to something that\u2019s dying. There\u2019s an urgency about this.\u201d</p> <p>He says small rural churches have a higher number of clergy per capita than dense, urban parishes. \u201cWhere the population is denser, there are fewer clergy around to reach those people. If we are an outward-facing church we need to position people where they\u2019re most needed: 83% of people live in urban areas, but 83% of [church] finance doesn\u2019t go there. But it should.\u201d</p> <p>The church, he said, needed to help some rural parishes \u201cface reality\u201d. Some of those parishes, historically the backbone of the Anglican church, are wincing in pain. Another key plank of the Renewal and Reform programme is the goal of recruiting 6,000 priests over the next 15 years, to be \u201cthe leadership of the church in the 2030s, 40s and 50s\u201d, says the church\u2019s secretary general, William Nye.</p> <p>About 70% of those selected for ordination are reported to be evangelicals, a figure likely to increase. Some study at <a href=\"https://www.stmellitus.org/\">St Mellitus College</a>, an HTB-inspired ordinand training centre based in London with outposts elsewhere in the UK, which is the fastest-growing ordinand college in England. St Mellitus had nine students in its first year, 2007. Last year the number was 215.</p> <p>\u201cSt Mellitus is training in a new way, with a new ethos,\u201d said Graham Tomlin, its president and the bishop of Kensington. Ordinands are attracted by its \u201clively, energetic, can-do, positive atmosphere\u201d, he added. Not all students were from an HTB background, but HTB\u2019s missional approach was central to college life. \u201cFifty or 100 years ago, it didn\u2019t matter what you did as a priest, people came to church anyway,\u201d said Tomlin. \u201cNow we need the kind of people who can build an outward-looking church with energy and vision.\u201d</p> <p>Tomlin and Thorpe are part of a cohort of bishops and key officials driving the church in an evangelical direction. They include Chris Russell, Welby\u2019s adviser on \u201cevangelism and witness\u201d. Evangelism and evangelicalism were different, he pointed out; people from any tradition in the church could evangelise; but evangelicals insist on the Bible as the sole authority. Nevertheless, the church\u2019s most ardent evangelists appear to be evangelicals.</p> <p>According to Ian Paul, a member of the Archbishops\u2019 Council, the church\u2019s central executive body, there is a \u201cformidable representation of evangelicals\u201d among bishops, \u201cone without precedent in modern times\u201d. Listing 18 (out of 42) dioceses with evangelical bishops, <a href=\"http://www.psephizo.com/life-ministry/are-evangelicals-taking-over-the-church/\">Paul wrote in the <em>Church Times</em></a> in February: \u201cThe large number of evangelical bishops is just the episcopal tip of an ecclesiastical iceberg.\u201d</p> <p>Not everyone was happy with this. \u201cLiberals might worry about a threat to the \u2018broad church\u2019; conservative evangelicals will wonder why it remains so broad,\u201d wrote Paul.</p> <p>Some in the broad middle feel marooned and neglected by the scale and pace of reform. Martyn Percy, the dean of Christ Church Oxford, and one of the most outspoken critics of Renewal and Reform, said Welby had a \u201cgroup of very loyal lieutenants around him, but a lot of people in the church feel we\u2019ve become exiles in our own institution\u201d. The church, he said, was in the grip of a \u201csmall group of elite organisationally minded evangelicals who think the church is a biddable, shapeable, governable body, and that\u2019s not the case. The reality is complex, messy, knotty.\u201d</p> <p>Much of the talk of \u201cbeing stronger and fitter for the 21st century is simply not believed by most people. All indices show there\u2019s no growth, and a lot of the ways in which [evangelicals] talk about God is fundamentally offputting. More people are turned off than turned on.\u201d</p> <p>The church was \u201can institution, based on values and existing independently of the popularity of those values\u201d, not an organisation that could be remodelled and relaunched. \u201cWe need to love and cherish the institution, and growth may come, or it may not,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Robert Cotton, rector of Holy Trinity Guildford and a member of the Archbishops\u2019 Council until earlier this year, said there was \u201can increasing disconnect between the rhetoric of the overall [Renewal and Reform] programme, and the ministry we do in the parishes. I\u2019m fully behind Justin wanting to do something about the health of the church, but I\u2019m not sure the language, the rhetoric, of Renewal and Reform is connecting with the sort of experience I have as a parish priest.\u201d</p> <p>The emphasis on growth in membership left him uneasy, he said. \u201cMembership is not the language that I and those that live in the soggy middle of the CofE often use. Of course we want more people to come to church, but I don\u2019t think of the church essentially as a membership organisation.\u201d</p> <p>Evangelical churches expected a degree of commitment that many people felt unable to give, said Cotton. \u201cThe C of E for centuries has seen itself as a church serving the whole nation \u2013 the religious enthusiasts as well as those who are unable to demonstrate that sort of enthusiasm, but still take the moral life, the life of good character, the life of community service very seriously. And the church for years has wanted to value and nourish those people even if they can\u2019t sign up to every article of the creed. The danger is that if we become too much a membership church, we\u2019re actually shrinking our connection with the country.\u201d</p> <p>But, said Thorpe, the bishop for church planting, the status quo was not an option. \u201cIf you\u2019re stuck in the past, you will decline because effectively you\u2019re locking yourself into a certain way of doing things, and everyone else moves on \u2026 I want to see the traditions of the church continue and be honoured and celebrated \u2013 and for us to infuse some of the best things of those traditions into current worship practice.</p> <p>\u201cBut I don\u2019t want [tradition] to be a god in its own right, that we can\u2019t change, because then the church will never change and adapt. One of the roles of the church is to present the message of the gospel to each generation. If we only present it in one particular way, to one particular generation, people will vote with their feet.\u201d</p> <h2>BROAD CHURCH: THE MAIN ANGLICAN DIVISIONS</h2> <p><strong>Anglo-Catholics</strong></p> <p>The sacraments are central. Services are characterised by the wearing of vestments, incense, bell ringing and silent prayer. Many opposed the ordination of women and the appointment of women bishops, and resist liberalisation of the stand on gay marriage. Some have left for the Roman Catholic church.</p> <p><strong>Traditionalists</strong></p> <p>Probably the largest (if least vocal) grouping. They believe in God, Queen and country \u2013 and a church presence in every town and village. They form the congregations of many traditional parish churches, and are the backbone of the Women\u2019s Institute, Mothers\u2019 Union and other Middle England institutions. Think Vicar of Dibley and the local church fete.</p> <p><strong>Liberals</strong></p> <p>Believe the church must be responsive to the world. The gospel can be \u2013 and has to be - reinterpreted for changing circumstances if the church is to be relevant to society. Women and gay clergy are embraced. Church of England liberals tend to be active in social action schemes and interfaith projects. God is green \u2013 and occasionally female.</p> <p><strong>Evangelicals</strong></p> <p>The authority of the bible is paramount and, for some, not open to reinterpretation. Evangelicals seek a direct and personal relationship with God. Worship is characterised by rock music, swaying and arm waving, hugging \u2013 and, for \u201ccharismatic evangelicals\u201d, speaking in tongues or possession by the Holy Spirit. Conservative evangelicals are biblical fundamentalists, but many British evangelicals \u2013 represented by Holy Trinity Brompton and the popular Alpha courses \u2013 appear more inclusive, although they are still theologically conservative.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 26 August 2016 to clarify the proportion of a Church of England grant allocated to the Harbour church in Portsmouth. <br></p>",
  "<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/aug/11/london-schoolgirl-kadiza-sultana-who-joined-isis-believed-killed-in-syria-airstrike\">Kadiza Sultana</a>, one of the Bethnal Green schoolgirls who travelled to Syria last year during a half-term break to join Islamic State, after being radicalised online, is believed to have been killed by a Russian airstrike on the city of Raqqa. On her arrival in Syria, Sultana, 16 when she left Britain, was married to an Islamic fighter, who was killed. She\u2019d confided to her family that she was disillusioned with life under Isis and was desperate to return home, but could see no way out. Another European female who\u2019d attempted to leave had been battered to death.</p> <p>While the fate of the other British schoolgirls, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/11/britons-joining-isis-grown-to-850-100-killed-syria-khadiza-sultana\">Amira Abase and Shamima Begum</a>, is unknown, Sultana has not been in contact with her family for several weeks and a number of sources now say that she\u2019s dead.</p> <p>All her own fault? Of course, but still it\u2019s devastating \u2013 this is not about Sultana \u201cgetting what was coming to her\u201d, or about the killing of a \u201cjihadi bride\u201d, it\u2019s about the pointless death of a headstrong, brainwashed teenage girl.</p> <p>I\u2019m not trying to argue that Sultana was \u201cheadstrong\u201d in the way that teenage girls who sneak out at night to meet their boyfriends are \u201cheadstrong\u201d. Nor would I minimise or sanitise the vileness she freely bought into. Sultana would have been aware of Islamic State atrocities \u2013 civilian bombings, shootings, beheadings. It\u2019s beyond comprehension how anyone, never mind a young girl, could be \u201cinspired\u201d by that, rather than repulsed. Moreover, Sultana was said to be bright, a good student; how could she have known about their archaic attitude to women, and still believed that somehow she would be considered equal to men, special, important?</p> <p>But then, isn\u2019t this how groomers operate \u2013 making their targets feel unique, noticed, admired? If people accept that children can be sexually groomed online, then why is it so difficult to believe that someone like Sultana can be ideologically groomed \u2013 radicalised \u2013 by people who know how to cynically manipulate the impressionable teenage psyche? This is how the dogma-flavoured \u201csweet nothings\u201d unfold. You\u2019re special \u2026 You\u2019re exceptional \u2026 You\u2019re destined for greatness. That\u2019s how teenagers like Sultana become fired up via the internet. Arguably, the fact that she was clever worked against her; she was resourceful enough to turn her hubris-fuelled fantasies into reality.</p> <p>If you simply can\u2019t comprehend how it could happen then you\u2019ve never met a teenager.</p> <p>It\u2019s not being a terror-apologist to know what teenagers can be like. Hormonal, volatile, irrational, painfully vulnerable, and that\u2019s just the resting temperature. At the extreme end, teenagers are children who are completely convinced that they\u2019re adults, with all the arrogance, rebellion and resentment that involves. No surprise then that teenagers are prone to making mistakes, sometimes appalling life-changing ones \u2013 bad company, criminality, unwanted pregnancy, serious infections, drugs, the list sprawls on. In Sultana\u2019s case, her appalling life-changing (and life-ending) mistake was to fall for terrorist rhetoric.</p> <p>Of course it\u2019s not the same as vandalism or shoplifting \u2013 no one\u2019s saying that it is. Nevertheless, Sultana was a teenager when she made her mistake, so a \u201cteenage mistake\u201d it remains. People can\u2019t re-frame Sultana\u2019s grotesque decisions as those of a fully grown woman just because they hate what she did, and what she stood for.</p> <p>In a sick way, the government\u2019s \u201cPrevent\u201d counter-terrorism strategy couldn\u2019t have wished for a better outcome. Before Sultana was a living cautionary tale; now she\u2019s become a dead one. And while some may feel that she deserved her fate, for me, it\u2019s hard to know what\u2019s more sickening \u2013 her death, or the fact that she was scared and desperate to come home. While I could never condone what Kadiza Sultana did, I can forgive a manipulated teenage girl an appalling mistake, especially when she regretted it, even more so when she died for it.</p> <h2>A duke pays taxes?

I\u2019ll get out the \u201cgood\u201d biscuits (the ones that don\u2019t already have bite-marks) and he can have a good look at the wench, get the vet to check out her teeth, tag her, perfectly reasonable courting stuff like that.</p> <p>I know I\u2019m supposed to be modern and feminist and all that, but I\u2019ll just pretend I haven\u2019t noticed\u2026</p> <p>(Sorry about that \u2013 I\u2019ve got my \u201cinner gold digger\u201d under control now.)</p> <p>How heartwarming to see that Hugh Grosvenor has inherited over two elder sisters \u2013 are there any other \u201colde worlde\u201d customs the 7th Duke would like to keep up \u2013 bear-baiting, witch-ducking, plagues of smallpox? Along with sexual inequality, there\u2019s the tax kind as well \u2013 as the billions are held in trust, they\u2019re unlikely to be depleted.</p> <p>How wonderful to avoid paying inheritance tax like ordinary mortals. No need either for those unpleasant scenes where people have to sell their property to pay for elderly care homes, so that after death duties, their progeny end up lucky to share a fiver and a bag of half-eaten pear drops between them.</p> <p>It just goes to show how clever, resourceful and \u201cbetter than us!\u201d the mega-wealthy are. Or something. While the Tories have successfully fought off greater transparency in such matters (David Cameron intervened at the European parliament with a zest unseen throughout his Remain campaign), it doesn\u2019t mean that ordinary people don\u2019t recognise brazen legal bias when they see it.</p> <h2>Why a judge\u2019s swearing means so much more</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bd94c0d562c6140f5372aef76e48da413a81904f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bd94c0d562c6140f5372aef76e48da413a81904f/0_0_2560_1536/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Patricia Lynch and defendant John Hennigan.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Patricia Lynch and defendant John Hennigan.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Composite: Photoshot/ Central News</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Sensitive readers should look away now as my potty mouth may cause offence. When John Hennigan was being sentenced for breaching an asbo (for using racist language towards a black family), he told <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/aug/11/patricia-lynch-john-hennigan-complaints-made-after-judge-trades-insults-with-defendant-in-court\">Patricia Lynch</a>, QC, that she was a \u201ca bit of a cunt\u201d. To which Judge Lynch responded: \u201cYou\u2019re a bit of a cunt too.\u201d</p> <p>Judge Lynch is now my new heroine \u2013 a kind of goddess of the legal swearbox. I\u2019d suggest that Disney make an animation about her, but there may be a few issues with the script. Joking apart, this incident seems to say something about the evolution of profanity.</p> <p>Even \u201ccunt\u201d, taboo a decade ago, appears to have taken on a new quasi-acceptability. It wasn\u2019t shocking that it was said in a court of law, just the fact that it was a judge who said it. If no words are truly barred anymore, then it also becomes about the science (art?) of swearing.</p> <p>When sprayed about, even hard-core profanity becomes white noise. It\u2019s only when it\u2019s unexpected, or from someone unexpected, that it has power and impact. Perhaps the takeaway lesson here could be: \u201cSwear less, but swear better.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>A couple of weeks ago, I went to see <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2016/jul/06/ayesha-hazarika-labour-best-drinker\" title=\"\">Ayesha Hazarika\u2019s </a>standup show, <a href=\"http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/uk/2016/03/why-ill-be-doing-stand-comedy-about-politics-power-and-pink-bus\" title=\"\"><em>Tales From the Pink Bus</em></a>. It told the story of how she spent years as a senior female adviser in the Labour party trying to get \u201cin the room\u201d: into the predominantly male meetings where the big decisions are made. She did finally make it, but as one of the only women, she found herself being the one who applied the Touche \u00c9clat before Ed Miliband\u2019s media appearances.</p> <p>It was filled with great gags that made me laugh. But as a woman who worked as an adviser to the party after the 2010 election, I found it touching a deeper nerve.</p> <p>Labour has always had a long-standing women problem. But this summer, it has burst into the open. As Labour women watched the second female Conservative prime minister take office, they\u2019ve been left asking the uncomfortable question: could it ever happen on our side? Just last week, the party announced the three candidates contesting high-profile mayoral elections next year. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/11/labour-mayoral-candidates-men-feminism-corbyn\" title=\"\">All men</a>.</p> <p>There\u2019s a popular narrative about the lack of Labour women in elected leadership positions. It runs like this: the hurdle at which women fall is when decisions go to a vote of members, whether parliamentary selections, elections to the party\u2019s national executive committee (NEC), or electing a leader. It takes you to solutions such as all-women shortlists and reserved spots for women on the NEC. Pat on the back, job done, right?</p> <p>Yes, positive discrimination is critical. Without all-women shortlists there would be far fewer Labour women in parliament. But this is a partial narrative and these solutions are insufficient. Labour\u2019s women problem runs deeper than members not electing women or the numbers of women in elected office.</p> <p>That\u2019s because the numbers don\u2019t tell the whole story. They don\u2019t tell us who\u2019s in the room when the key decisions are taken. Or which voices are taken seriously round the shadow cabinet table and which are ignored. Or who\u2019s shaped the strategy and who\u2019s been informed after the fact.</p> <p>To me, it\u2019s tokenistic to promise half a shadow cabinet of women if you don\u2019t bother to invite any of them to the discussions that count or to share the key election platforms.</p> <p>It\u2019s not just a lack of women in elected office: Labour also has a problem with a lack of women in senior strategic jobs appointed by the party. The moment when I realised the whopping nature of that problem is burned in my mind.</p> <p>Shortly before I left my job at the party in 2012, a number of new executive director jobs were created. When the new appointments were announced, it turned out only one was a woman (predictably, she got the \u201cgovernance and services\u201d role, not the strategy, policy or comms ones).</p> <p>And there were to be only two women on an executive board of around 12.</p> <p>Not a great look when just a couple of years ago, Harriet Harman as minister for women had <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/8316147.stm\" title=\"\">lambasted City firms</a> for a lack of women on boards as a result of institutionalised gender discrimination.</p> <p>So, at a staff meeting to communicate the appointments, I asked what they were going to do about it. I expected an anodyne but warm response about talent pipelines, mentoring and nurturing potential.</p> <p>I was shocked when the response I got basically amounted to: \u201cWe appointed the best people for the jobs.\u201d</p> <p>Well, of course. But there\u2019s so much wrong with what was missing from that answer, I hardly know where to start.</p> <p>It\u2019s difficult to challenge these cultures without more openness about women\u2019s experiences of working for the party. But one reason I found Ayesha\u2019s show not just funny and poignant, but brave, is that it can be difficult for those who have experienced the sharp end of Labour\u2019s women problem to talk about it.</p> <p>When I was younger, I thought if I were to encounter gender discrimination it would be tangible, easily discernible, the kind of thing you could sum up in 140 characters and tag #everdaysexism on the end. But often, there\u2019s a subjectivity and subtlety to workplace misogyny that makes it hard to call out.</p> <p>If you\u2019re a normal person with any element of self-doubt you can always explain away things with reference to your own weaknesses. It takes a lot of confidence to be able to connect your experience with the macro picture: a lack of women in the senior positions that count.</p> <p>Moreover, talking about institutional but subtle gender discrimination doesn\u2019t really fit with our societal narratives about success. Who wants to be the person labelled as the whingey one, the one who makes excuses, the one who\u2019s compensating for her own lack of success? It\u2019s taken me four years to write this column and Ayesha\u2019s show to shame me into doing it.</p> <p>Finally, I think there\u2019s a misunderstanding that when women raise concerns about institutional gender discrimination they\u2019re accusing male colleagues of consciously doing down women.</p> <p>That\u2019s not my experience of working for the Labour party. I worked with some wonderful and very well-intentioned men, from the very top down, who would have considered themselves fully engaged in the frontline fight for equality \u2013 gender, social or educational.</p> <p>But to assume that\u2019s enough is to misunderstand modern-day misogyny. It\u2019s rarely about men waking up in the morning and thinking about how they can go about undermining women. More often, it\u2019s under the radar, manifesting itself in institutions and cultures that involve people who would be horrified to think they might be helping to perpetuate, rather than tackle, societal sexism.</p> <p>It\u2019s things like not looking round the room, and asking why there\u2019s only one woman there or appointing (very capable, but so often male) contacts to jobs rather than advertising them, or, when you do advertise, failing to do anything to encourage applications from less usual suspects.</p> <p>There\u2019s a deep irony to this. It\u2019s the Labour party that is supposed to understand that where we end up is not just a matter of individual effort, but of context, cultures and institutions. Yet the party seems unable to apply this critical insight to itself. Not just when it comes to gender, but in relation to class and educational background too.</p> <p>This has profound consequences, impossible to do justice to here. But I don\u2019t think it\u2019s an exaggeration to say an ability to rectify this might be related to questions of the party\u2019s survival. The bitter factional fighting Labour has descended into is a (hopefully temporary) distraction from the massive existential questions facing social democratic parties across the west.</p> <p>I can\u2019t see Labour finding an answer to them without a greater diversity of voices in the room.</p> <p><em>\u2022</em> Comments will be opened later</p>",
  "<p>China\u2019s senior diplomat in Britain, Liu Xiaoming, has a reputation for undiplomatic remarks. The ambassador\u2019s infamous likening of Japanese prime minister<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jan/06/japan-china-voldemort-harry-potter\" title=\"\"> Shinzo Abe\u2019s government</a> to Lord Voldemort, Harry Potter\u2019s threatening nemesis, did little to ease historical bilateral tensions between the two countries. His blunt remarks last week about the <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/08/09/chinas-relationship-with-uk-at-risk-over-hinkley-point-delay-war/\" title=\"\">delay to the Hinkley Point nuclear power station project</a> ordered by Theresa May also jarred badly.</p> <p>Liu put the government on notice that cancellation of the troubled \u00a318bn scheme, in which the state-owned company, China General Nuclear Power (CGN), has (or would have) a 33% stake, could have serious, negative consequences for wider trade, investment and political relations between Britain and China. His warnings about damaged \u201cmutual trust\u201d and a \u201ccritical juncture\u201d sounded less like the counsel of a friend, more like the threats of a bully.</p> <p>There was a time, not so long ago, when ill-considered public comments by a senior Chinese official might have been safely ignored. Britain was often the target of vituperative abuse in the period leading up to the Hong Kong handover in 1997. Chris Patten, the last British governor, still bears the scars. The pressure did not discernibly affect government policy. But times change and so, too, does the balance of power, which has swung decisively in China\u2019s favour in the succeeding two decades. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2007/jun/29/politics.china\" title=\"\">Britain needs China now </a>in ways it did not in the past.</p> <p>This does not mean insulting or threatening behaviour is any more acceptable. But it does mean that May will feel obliged to give serious weight to China\u2019s concerns over Hinkley when a final decision is made next month. Similar pragmatic calculations lay behind the ingratiating welcome afforded Xi Jinping, China\u2019s unelected Communist leader, in London last autumn, and the former chancellor George Osborne\u2019s myopic championing of a lucrative new \u201c<a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-34621254\" title=\"\">golden era</a>\u201d in Sino-British ties. If it is to prosper in a globalised 21st century prospectively dominated by China and other emerging powers such as India, Britain must, to some degree, kowtow to Beijing.</p> <p>In recent years, China has invested more capital in Britain than in any other EU country. As an export market, its potential is unmatched. Britain, meanwhile, despite all Osborne\u2019s austerity, is deeply in debt and living beyond its means. As Stephen King of HSBC put it: \u201cIf the Chinese turn their backs on us, then we\u2019ll have to tighten our belts even further, particularly if we\u2019re given a frosty reception by the Chinese-sponsored Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, reducing the opportunities for British business to operate within the world\u2019s most dynamic region.\u201d</p> <p>But this changed reality is also partly the product of choices freely entered into. By voting to leave the EU, Britain has made an additional rod for its back. Brexit will exacerbate Britain\u2019s vulnerability, both economic and political, in a dangerous world where, as Mark Carney, the Bank of England governor, rightly says, it depends increasingly on the kindness of strangers. As we have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/may/25/observer-editorial-china-challenge-not-threat\" title=\"\">argued in the past</a>, it may be time, as American and west European power fades, for countries such as China to shape a new world order. Who knows, they may eventually do a better job. It would not be difficult.</p> <p>Yet it is also true that China\u2019s one-party system, its huge democratic deficit, its lack of transparency, its disregard for human rights, religious freedoms and international legal norms, and yes, its leaders\u2019 tendency towards bullying are sharply at odds with British values, standards and policy aims. The Hinkley decision has suddenly been rendered more fraught by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/aug/11/hinkley-point-c-case-against-cgn-has-the-feel-of-a-modern-spy-thriller\" title=\"\">US allegations of industrial espionage</a> involving CGN and by Australia\u2019s refusal, on grounds of security, to allow Chinese control of a key energy asset.</p> <p>This tension between who we are and who we do business with has always been present. A good example in recent decades has been Britain\u2019s close and controversial collaboration with oil-rich Saudi Arabia. But corrupting though the alliance with Riyadh was, it did not fundamentally change Britain\u2019s worldview. The case is altered now. Our wilful undermining of our key European alliances means that over time, Britain, alone, may struggle to stand up to the likes of China, defend its values and maintain relationships based on mutual respect. There will be more Hinkleys. The effect could be highly corrosive.</p> <p>In the big, bad, lonely world beyond Brexit, predators of many varieties roam. Last week saw a reminder from the incorrigible Vladimir Putin, Russia\u2019s president, that the Crimea crisis of 2014 is far from over and that the war in Ukraine could reignite at any moment. The particulars of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/10/vladimir-putin-may-believe-time-is-ripe-for-another-invasion\" title=\"\">latest flare-up</a> are less significant than the fact that Putin again appears ready to place European security at hazard, just as his actions regularly challenge Nato, his bombers and helicopter gunships murder civilians in Aleppo and his sports officials blithely ignore international doping rules.</p> <p>Surely nobody is sensibly suggesting Britain, in a fit of panicky, post-Brexit international outreach, should try to bury its differences with the reckless, lawless regime in Moscow, notwithstanding last week\u2019s embarrassing <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/aug/09/may-and-putins-first-phone-conversation-hints-at-thawing-tensions\" title=\"\">telephone calls to the Kremlin</a> by May and Boris Johnson, the foreign secretary. Putin, after all, stands accused by an official British inquiry of direct complicity in the murder of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/alexander-litvinenko\" title=\"\">Alexander Litvinenko</a>, the former KGB agent poisoned with polonium in London. If Putin were an African leader, there would be calls for him to be investigated by now by the International Criminal Court for possible war crimes in Syria, Ukraine and Chechnya.</p> <p>Yet the question nevertheless arises: how does Britain, no longer working in close concert with France, Germany and Poland, propose to manage the Russian problem? Will Moscow, like China sensing weakness and uncertainty, be tempted to pressure and bully May\u2019s untested government, even as armed forces chiefs warn <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/aug/10/russian-army-can-outgun-british-according-to-leaked-report\" title=\"\">they are outgunned </a>by the Russians? Will May try to win Putin round or will she confront him? Her first test comes next month at the G20 summit in China. One thing is already certain: the hapless Johnson is no match for Sergei Lavrov, his veteran counterpart. A Lavrov-Johnson summit would be like inviting a wolf to take tea with a tethered goat.</p> <p>Brexit\u2019s champions promised to forge a range of post-Brussels international relationships, thereby creating a more vibrant, prosperous Britain. China and Russia show just how perilous and problematic this project is. History suggests Britain can look to the US for succour and support.

  "<p>As the annual clearing process for university places gets under way, universities are investing in ever-more innovative ways of marketing to students, reflecting an increasingly competitive market now government has lifted caps on student numbers, allowing universities to recruit as many students as they like. But given that the headline price of degrees has tripled in recent years, there is inevitably more scrutiny of their value.</p> <p>Some might argue we should leave this judgment to the market; the fact that growing numbers of students feel it is an investment worth making tells us all we need to know. It\u2019s also a difficult judgment to make in a nuanced way; it would be ridiculous to imply a degree\u2019s only value lies in its earnings-boosting potential.</p> <p>But it\u2019s becoming increasingly important to ask hard questions about value for money. Universities enjoyed a significant 28% increase in average per-<a href=\"http://www.ifs.org.uk/comms/r94.pdf\" title=\"\">undergraduate funding</a> as a result of the increase in the tuition fee cap to \u00a39,000 and they have successfully lobbied for the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/jul/20/english-universities-to-raise-tuition-fees-for-first-time-since-they-trebled\" title=\"\">cap to rise even further</a>.</p> <p>University funding has grown healthily just as funding for <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-35101935\" title=\"\">further education colleges</a> has been slashed, per-pupil school funding is falling and the NHS is struggling to find efficiency savings. Universities may not be public institutions in the same ways as schools and hospitals, but they receive a significant chunk of public funding and should be asked to account for what they deliver from a value-for-money perspective.</p> <p>Moreover, in recent months, stark variations in the graduate premium \u2013 the amount graduates earn compared to non-graduates \u2013 have become more evident. The <a href=\"https://www.ifs.org.uk/publications/8233\" title=\"\">Institute for Fiscal Studies</a> has found that graduates of some subjects, such as the creative arts, do not appear to earn any more on average than non-graduates. Average earnings for male graduates of 23 universities were actually lower than for non-graduates.</p> <p>It is too simplistic to look at headline earnings in isolation, but this is surely information young people taking on significant amounts of debt have a right to access when they\u2019re making decisions. This is particularly when six in 10 <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-33983048\" title=\"\">graduates find themselves in jobs that don\u2019t require a degree</a> and fewer than four in 10 students think their degrees represent good <a href=\"http://www.hepi.ac.uk/2016/06/09/students-demand-better-value-money-nine-10-students-not-want-higher-fees/\" title=\"\">value for money</a>.</p> <p>There are two potential responses. The first is to argue we have too many young people going to university. This is crazy when Britain must create more high-skills jobs to compete and a reduction in undergraduate numbers would almost certainly come at the expense of poorer students, particularly with the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jan/17/observer-editorial-university-funding-maintenance-grants-loans\" title=\"\">abolition of maintenance grants</a>.</p> <p>The right response is surely to ask how we can better improve the match between the skills young people develop through their degrees and those needed by the labour market, and whether degrees can be delivered more efficiently.</p> <p>This is particularly important given that the big funding increase awarded to universities was a policy mishap. The government misjudged the impact of its fee reforms; it thought the average fee would be about \u00a36,000 a year rather the \u00a38,600 it jumped to. Higher-than-expected fees mean the government has to fund bigger subsidised loans to cover those fees (although this funding does not count towards the deficit in the government\u2019s accounting rules). So the reforms ended up saving barely anything for taxpayers, but costing students much more, leaving universities the beneficiaries.</p> <p>The government has not asked universities to do anything significant in exchange for this windfall in perpetuity. Not in terms of improving transparency about what money gets spent on or what is included in the teaching offer. Universities have resisted attempts to improve transparency, even <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/student/news/russell-group-universities-and-cambridge-colleges-write-to-government-to-be-exempted-from-freedom-of-a6769336.html\" title=\"\">lobbying for exclusions from FOI legislation</a>. Nor are they open to being held to account for the quality of the academic experience or their efforts to widen participation and improve retention.</p> <p>The university sector is not thirsty for cash in the same ways as schools or the NHS; as highlighted by <a href=\"http://wonkhe.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/PEXJ3802_High-Further-Faster-More-15.10.15_VFINAL.pdf\" title=\"\">Policy Exchange</a>, the sector has discretionary reserves equal to 48% of its annual operating income. University vice-chancellors enjoy very healthy levels of <a href=\"http://www.if.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Graduate_Premium_final.compressed.pdf\" title=\"\">take-home pay</a>.</p> <p>So it was a mistake for the government to give way so easily on increases to the fee cap. It should be allowing inflation to reduce the real value of the fee cap over time to the level it originally predicted fees would settle on. University funding should not be allowed to rise while the rest of the education budget is being squeezed. It\u2019s a wrong-headed and regressive way to allocate education spending.</p>",

Viagogo and StubHub did not respond to requests for comment. The highest-priced ticket on the official website of Nimax Theatres, which owns the Palace, is \u00a3140.</p> <p>The play\u2019s producers attacked those trying to make a profit out of fans\u2019 desperation to see the play, which has proved so popular that some Harry Potter fans have been travelling to London from other countries to see it.</p> <p>\u201cThe secondary ticket market is an industry-wide plague, and one which we as producers take very seriously,\u201d Friedman and Callender said in a statement. \u201cOur priority is to protect all our customers and we are doing all we can to combat this issue.\u201d</p> <p>They said that anyone prepared to fork out thousands for a ticket could still be turned away at the door.</p> <p>\u201cWe have already been able to identify, and refuse entry, to a significant number&nbsp;of people who purchased tickets through resale sites and will continue to track down touts and refuse entry to anyone who has knowingly bought a ticket from a tout through the secondary market.\u201d</p> <p>Staff at the Palace Theatre have been told to refuse entry for tickets that they are able to identify as resold.</p> <p>Anyone turned away will be given a \u201crefusal of entry\u201d letter, allowing them to contact the websites to ask for their money back.</p> <p>Tickets for the play by Jack Thorne \u2013 based on a new story by himself, author Rowling and John Tiffany \u2013 which started its West End run in June and will continue until December 2017, have proved hugely popular.</p> <p>Some 250,000 new tickets were put on sale last week and sold out on the day, which prompted the producers to add new dates to be announced later this year.</p> <p>As well as the tickets advertised on Viagogo and StubHub, hundreds are listed on rival sites for similarly eye-watering sums.

And the NEC [national executive council] will no doubt ask him questions and he will give answers on it. But let\u2019s look at that when the new NEC takes over.</p> <p><strong>Do you think the Labour party HQ has been even-handed in its approach to the leadership contest?</strong><br></p> <p>I say this: there will be a report on what has gone on.

How will this reshape education?</strong><br></p> <p>The idea is that we have an educational system that is wraparound and gives everyone opportunities. What we have got in Britain is a commodified education system where university and to some extent college education is concerned.</p> <p>We have insufficient access to preschool education for the youngest children. And we have a growing mix-up of secondary education between free schools and academies and local authority maintained schools. What we want is a national education concept that moves towards all children getting access to preschool facilities.</p> <p>We need a guarantee of class sizes of 30 or less in primary schools. There are a considerable number that are over 30, 31, some that are even bigger than that \u2013 up to 38 \u2013 and that is completely wrong. Therefore, we need more teachers, above all we need to retain more teachers. Sadly too many leave the profession very early because they are over-burdened by workloads and pressure on them. In secondary schools we have an increasing number of free schools and academies outside local authority orbit and the pay and conditions of the nationally agreed system. I am keen to re-establish local authorities as the family of education.</p> <p>We have also seen the sad demise of the once great adult education service in Britain, which was fantastic. Where local authorities would spend not very much money but get huge return for it. Adults could return to evening classes, night schools, weekend stuff where they could take degrees, study languages, study skills. Sometimes purely out of the joy of doing it. Sometimes for career development. I want to see a return to the levels of that and an extension of it. Then, of course, there is the question of university funding and the levels of fees. The government has finally ended the grant maintenance scheme altogether, which means that no student now gets any public support to go to university whatsoever. They have got to borrow for it and that means debt levels will rise. We have already seen a reduction in the number of students from working class and poor families going to university. I expect that is going to continue because they are raising the university fee cap.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2016/08/labour-vtories/giv-31075QMBH2Abui5aI/\" data-alt=\"Polling data for Labour and the Conservatives\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2016/08/labour-vtories/giv-31075QMBH2Abui5aI/\">Polling data for Labour and the Conservatives</a> </figure>  <p><strong>Would you abolish tuition fees?</strong><br></p> <p>That would be the aim, yes. And to bring back maintenance grants for those who need them. It\u2019s going to be expensive, I understand that. But I also understand that as a society it works. A better educated society works for all of us and we will close the productivity gap by doing so. And we can look at countries <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jun/04/tuition-fees-germany-higher-education\">that don\u2019t charge university fees such as Germany</a>, which has a much higher standard of university level education for the whole population as a result.</p> <p><strong>How do you fund that level of expenditure?</strong><br></p> <p>It is expensive. We fund it through corporate taxation levels. By not reducing taxation and by chasing down tax avoidance and tax evasion.</p> <p><strong>Tax evasion. That won\u2019t bring in enough to fund it \u2026</strong><br></p> <p>It brings in as much as we can get. But it means we have to deal with the system that encourages it.

If we invest in it we will benefit from it.</p> <p><strong>The RMT strikes, do you support them?</strong><br></p> <p>I understand why they are doing it. Absolutely. Because in the case of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/aug/10/southern-rail-dispute-thursday-and-friday-strikes-called-off\">Southern</a> the company has not fulfilled its obligations as far as I see it. The people who use Southern on the Brighton line are unbelievably angry about it. I am getting out-lefted by Tory MPs all down the line who want to take back the franchise, take the keys from Southern and give it over to Direct Rail. Direct Rail ran the north-east franchise extremely well. The exchequer got \u00a3600m out of it and instead it is now being handed over to Virgin and we have got overcrowding of mega proportions on the trains and we are not getting the same amount of money back.</p> <p><strong>Do you back the strikes on Southern and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/12/eurostar-strike-suspended-midnight-further-talks-rmt\">Eurostar</a>?</strong><br></p> <p>Yes, because I understand why they are doing it.</p> <p><strong>MPs and other critics have said that your message is too narrow. To get elected you will have to win seats from the SNP in Scotland, from Conservatives in the south and defend seats against Plaid in Wales and Ukip in the north. We are here in Sunderland where you have given a speech to 2,000 supporters which was very well received, and yet one of the local MPs, Sharon Hodgson, in her <a href=\"http://www.sharonhodgson.org/sharon_writes_to_local_labour_party_members_on_her_resignation_and_her_support_for_owen_smith_mp\">letter explaining why she was standing down</a> from the shadow frontbench, said: \u201cTo win a general election, we need to appeal to not only core Labour voters, but the wider electorate. Sadly, my experience on the doorstep across the country is that crucial swing voters will never vote for a labour government led by Jeremy, and I have experienced this on the doorstep in Washington and Sunderland West.\u201d</strong><strong> How are you going to reach out beyond the core to a wider electorate?</strong></p> <p>The appeal of our message has to be if you want real opportunities for everybody you have to invest in our society in a way that doesn\u2019t increase inequality, which is what we have got at the moment. Essentially, the Tories have reduced corporate taxation, the top level of taxation, and cut services at the other end. And frozen public sector wages. Every family in Britain is affected in some way or another by the housing issue. At one end it is being homeless \u2026 At another level it is being unable to buy your first-time flat or home or anything else and having to stay with your parents until you are 30 or 40. We have a system that does not build or supply the houses that are necessary and, indeed, under the housing act forces councils to sell high-value properties in high cost areas. And so the housing issue affects pretty much everybody. Invest in housing that is good for everybody.</p> <p>Secondly, the NHS effects everybody. An NHS that is part-privatised, an NHS that is so underfunded that it ends up rationing expensive medicines and mental health services is so underfunded that many people go untreated. So my message is to those who do not consider themselves to be the poorest and vulnerable in society but relatively well off: you actually will benefit from a good health service.</p> <p><strong>But that messaging is not reflected in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/polls\">polling</a> \u2026 no one has ever won an election with polling as poor as yours. The message has not got out to a wide enough number of people.</strong><br></p> <p>We have done our best to get our message out. It hasn\u2019t been helped that prominent people in the Labour party \u2013 Labour MPs \u2013 have spent the last 10 months actively being unsupportive of our policies that have been generally agreed and supported. Now everyone agrees that anti-austerity is the right line to be taking.</p> <p>And since the resignations in July and the leadership contest, then clearly the public mind has become focused on the leadership contest rather than the future. I\u2019m trying to turn this leadership campaign into a campaign of how we would run a general election. How we would win back those areas of Britain that have become disillusioned \u2013 left-behind Britain.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b292998b73a47ffe162bfab10e32547ecd62c3ff\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b292998b73a47ffe162bfab10e32547ecd62c3ff/0_274_4368_2621/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jeremy Corbyn\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018We are all selected and supported by the party.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gary Calton/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>You mentioned the discord in the party. Let\u2019s talk about those MPs, many of whom are peeling away not for ideological reasons but for reasons of competence. Lilian Greenwood MP, in <a href=\"http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/staggers/2016/07/lilian-greenwood-mp-jeremy-corbyn-continually-undermined-me-job-i-loved\">explaining why she was resigning</a> from the shadow cabinet, said in a letter that: \u201c[Jeremy] is not a team player let alone a team leader \u2026 he doesn\u2019t understand collective responsibility and he can\u2019t lead a team. This is not about policy or ideology, it is about competence.\u201d She wrote of her frustration and upset that a policy launch on rail fares was undermined by the announcement of a shadow cabinet reshuffle that same day.</strong></p> <p>I am surprised that Lilian has taken this line. She and I sat down in her office with her team and we had a very good discussion about transport policies and we agreed a programme of activities. Why she should feel it necessary to write a letter like that at this moment she alone would know the answer to that.</p> <p><strong>But the reasons are in the letter: you announced a reshuffle on the day that the rail strategy that she had worked on for months was also being announced, and as a result it got buried by the reshuffle.</strong></p> <p>She knew full well that a reshuffle was happening at that time. Listen, choreography of news is not always the easiest thing to achieve. That was actually several months ago and so I have been happy to work with her and others and come the election result I will be happy to work with them again. And I hope that they will recognise that so far over 200 constituency parties have made a nomination for me as a leader of the party. That is far more than nominated me a year ago on a far greater, far higher level of participation by party members by those nominating at meetings. That is surely a sign of something.</p> <p><strong>But doesn\u2019t this get to the heart of the problems in the Labour party in that some of those MPs will say that they get their mandate from their constituents and there are 9.4 million Labour voters. The MPs \u2026 say they don\u2019t see you as an electable PM, so they are privileging loyalty to their constituents, which is a far greater number than the 500,000 or so Labour members.</strong><br></p> <p>We all take our mandate from our constituents. I do as well.</p> <p><strong>So in that case it\u2019s perfectly reasonable for MPs, who are taking soundings from voters, to say they are unwilling to support you as leader because they don\u2019t see you as being electable as a prime minister.</strong></p> <p>Of course it is perfectly reasonable.</p> <p><strong>But why do you keep calling them out for their disloyalty? Especially as someone who was a serial disloyal Labour MP under previous Labour governments. You voted 438 times against Labour. </strong><br></p> <p>No, I was standing for what I thought were very important principles such as on identity cards, such as on terrorism legislation, such as on the Iraq war, student fees. Those were the points of rebellion. I did not ever take any personal abuse or issues with anybody on the frontbench. I have never done that sort of politics, I never have.</p> <p><strong>No, but if these MPs feel as though their constituents will not be served by a Labour party that is not electable then it is a principled position for them to take, isn\u2019t it?</strong><br></p> <p>They can take a position, and they have done. And they are welcome to make the comments that they do. But I just remind them that we are all members of the Labour party. We are all selected and promoted and supported by members of the Labour party. And recruiting 300,000 people in a year has never ever been achieved before. I think some credit should be given where it is due. I would say to them, let\u2019s understand that the mood out there has changed. People don\u2019t want to live in an unequal society any more. There is thirst for real political change \u2026 People have had enough of neo-liberal economics and had enough of the politics of endless inequality.</p> <p><strong>You seem far more energised by this leadership campaign than by the European Union campaign. You have done 19 rallies in the leadership campaign. You did 10 in the EU referendum campaign. You seem to be enjoying this more than you did campaigning to stay in the EU.</strong><br></p> <p>I did more media appearances than the whole of the shadow cabinet put together in the referendum campaign. I made the case for Remain recognising the problems that the EU had on competitive postal services, for example, and there is a debate about a free market direction of Europe and there is a debate about the social Europe \u2013 and I obviously choose the social Europe model and I voted against Maastricht. I strongly supported the social chapter, and I supported the workers\u2019 time directive. Presumably Article 50 [of the Lisbon treaty] will be invoked at some point but we have to protect those advances but also ensure that we continue to gain market access. Here, in Sunderland, it relies very heavily on exports to Europe.</p> <p><strong>What is the right balance between public and private in the economy, do you think?</strong><br></p> <p>What I want to see is properly funded public services and recognise the public services role in helping people in employment. There has to be a much greater public role in industry and development. We don\u2019t shy away from the idea of investing in manufacturing industry. This country is very good at inventing things, discovering things, but very bad at developing things \u2026 linear motors, jet engines to some extent, tilting trains. We end up exporting the technology to somewhere else. If we had an effective national investment strategy we would be able to develop manufacturing process that goes with it.</p> <p>If we are to say to people: you invent something good, develop the manufacturing process as well \u2026 What happens now is that the banks won\u2019t lend to them because they say it\u2019s too risky, so a hedge fund comes along, buys the idea and then sells it somewhere else. And we end up developing the idea and losing the process. Can we not keep the process instead?</p> <p><strong>Do you want to take public ownership?</strong><br></p> <p>No it\u2019s about participation and partnerships \u2026 the straight public ownership we want to look at is the rail system, which these days has universal support in the Labour party.</p> <p><strong>Any others?</strong><br></p> <p>The Royal Mail \u2013 it\u2019s a crucial public service, it\u2019s a natural monopoly. It is ludicrous the idea of competition in postal delivery.</p> <p><strong>This campaign is turning a little nasty. There was a lot of booing at the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2016/aug/11/labour-leadership-debate-jeremy-corbyn-owen-smith-gateshead-live\">event last night</a>.</strong><br></p> <p>People should treat other with respect.

Why has it happened over the last 10 months?</strong></p> <p>Unfortunately there has always been nastiness in politics, There has always been abuse in politics. I regret it and I deplore it. And I deplore it if it has increased. It\u2019s wrong.</p> <p><strong>Do you think it has increased?</strong><br></p> <p>No. I am not sure it has. I know that I have received more abuse than I ever use to. But then maybe I\u2019m better known these days. But I receive more abuse than anybody else. The best way of dealing with abuse is: ignore it.</p> <p>But MPs are saying they are on the receiving end of abuse and they can\u2019t ignore it.<br></p> <p>When there is racist abuse, misogynist abuse, threats against people \u2013 that is utterly, totally, completely wrong.</p> <p><strong>One of the reasons that the Labour party didn\u2019t perform better last time around is that they were marked down on economic competence, and a lot of what you outlined today is seemingly of appeal to a lot of people \u2026 better childcare, a better funded NHS, more social housing. But a lot of people will ask, \u201cWhere is the money coming from?\u201d How do you win the argument about economic competence?</strong><br></p> <p>I think one of the problems that we had was that none of us did enough to explain why the economic crisis came about in 2008-09 and so we allowed the narrative to develop that the crash of 2008-09 was caused by alleged high levels of spending by that Labour government. It was absolutely nothing to do with it. It was much more to do with the subprime mortgage crisis in the USA, over-exposed banks and the lack of banking regulations.</p> <p>I think now everyone would agree with that but we allowed that narrative to develop that Labour crashed the economy, that it spent too much. The economy crashed because it wasn\u2019t regulated enough.</p> <p>The other issue about competence is about how you deal with public investment. You either deal with it through very expensive PFI [private finance initiative] type funding \u2013 which ends up with a lack of public control and greater costs to the public \u2013 or you do it through traditional public investment through a public works loan board or a national investment bank, which gives better services for all.</p> <p><strong>Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump?</strong><br></p> <p>Well I can\u2019t be with Trump, can I? I can\u2019t be with Trump so obviously with Hillary.</p>",
  "<p>British police have come under fire for their role in training Bahrain\u2019s police force, which has been accused of ruthlessly suppressing public protests and dissent.</p> <p>A confidential 27-page \u201cagreement for the provision of services\u201d, obtained by the <em>Observer</em>, was signed on 14 June 2015 by the UK\u2019s College of Policing and Bahrain\u2019s Ministry of Interior. It spells out the explicitly commercial nature of the relationship between the two parties, but omits any mention of human rights issues.</p> <p>Since it was created in 2012, the college has earned more than \u00a38.5m from its international work, but has faced questions about its remit. Parliament\u2019s home affairs select committee recently criticised the college\u2019s overseas training programme, claiming that \u201copaque\u201d agreements with foreign governments, which have been criticised for human rights abuses, \u201cthreaten the integrity of the very brand of British policing that the college is trying to promote\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jun/15/bahrain-paying-royal-navy-base-human-rights-criticism\">Bahrain paying for Royal Navy base despite human rights criticism</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The committee attacked the Foreign Office\u2019s refusal to divulge such contracts on the grounds of commercial sensitivity as \u201ccompletely unacceptable\u201d.</p> <p>Now a law firm acting on behalf of a Bahraini activist allegedly tortured by the country\u2019s security services has written to the Foreign Office, claiming that the nature of the agreement with Bahrain raises concerns about the UK\u2019s commitment to protecting human rights.</p> <p>Daniel Carey, of DPG Law, said the government needed to give reassurances that the college was not providing assistance to the kingdom\u2019s security forces that could undermine the UK\u2019s commitment to human rights. \u201cWe know the college provides a wide range of training programmes domestically that are of potential concern, such as the use of communications data obtained by telecoms operators, the use of interception material, surveillance and undercover policing, and the scope of its courses to overseas customers is not limited in any accountable way,\" said Carey.</p> <p>He also questioned whether the college was a legitimate entity. \u201cThe College of Policing is doing something unusual for government in selling services overseas. It is a company limited by guarantee set up by the Home Office. Whether government ministers have the power to set up bodies effectively external to their own department through which they then run profit-making activities is a difficult question of constitutional law. The much safer course is to get parliament\u2019s authority, which didn\u2019t happen here.\u201d</p> <p>The Foreign Office insists that all international work undertaken by the college is referred to the International Policing Assistance Board, which examines any potential impact on the UK\u2019s commitment to human rights. It is understood that all sub-contracts governed by the umbrella agreement have built-in clauses referring to human rights.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>If anything, abuses at the hands of Bahraini police have increased in 2016 amid a culture of impunity</p> <footer> <cite>Sayed Ahmed Alwadaei, Bahrain Institute for Rights and Democracy</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>A spokeswoman for the Foreign Office said: \u201cIt is not good enough to merely criticise other countries from the sidelines. Only by working with Bahrain are we able to bring about the changes we would like to see in the country. The UK is working closely with the government of Bahrain to provide extensive reform assistance focused on strengthening human rights and the rule of law. We see this support as the most constructive way to achieve long-lasting and sustainable reform in Bahrain.\u201d</p> <p>But Carey said the omission of human rights in the agreement was significant: \u201cThe agreement cedes a lot of control to the Bahrain government to pick and choose the areas it would like training on. It provides for all of the other controls you would expect: freedom of information; <em>force majeure</em>; confidentiality; intellectual property; termination; bribery. Why not human rights? Saying that this will be slipped into a subcontract does not seem to be an effective way to protect against human rights risks, especially after resisting disclosure of any of these details to a parliamentary committee.\u201d</p> <p>Sayed Ahmed Alwadaei, director of advocacy at the Bahrain Institute for Rights and Democracy, called for the UK to end the commercial relationship between the college and Bahrain\u2019s Ministry of Interior. \u201cWe have continued to document widespread and systemic rights violations committed by the Bahraini police throughout this training, which started in 2013,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cIf anything, abuses at the hands of the police have increased in 2016, amid a culture of impunity and a lack of transparency from both British and Bahraini institutions. As a result, the training has done little more than legitimise the status quo. Over the past few months, Bahrain has let go of all pretences of reform by cracking down on peaceful demonstrations, torturing detainees and arresting anyone with a critical voice.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>It is a sprawling fantasy featuring deformed humans, superheroes who can read minds and fly, and plot lines exploring issues such as bigotry and raw political ambition. Like the blockbuster TV hit <em>Game of Thrones</em>, it is also based in part on the work of the cult fantasy writer George RR Martin.</p> <p>Now Hollywood is betting that a major TV adaptation of <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/aug/08/wild-cards-george-rr-martin-tv-adaptation\">Wild Cards</a></em>, a series of science fiction books grounded in gritty realism that Martin began writing 30 years ago, can emulate the extraordinary worldwide success of the HBO show. If it does, it will fulfil the dreams of Martin\u2019s collaborator on <em>Wild Cards</em>, Melinda Snodgrass, who has struggled in vain for 12 years to interest film and television producers.</p> <p>The US writer and editor was praised by executives, only to be given excuses about why the books were not for them. She refused to be bowed by rejection and her determination has finally paid off. She is now heading an ambitious TV adaption of the series backed by Universal Pictures. </p> <p>The phenomenal global success of <em>Game of Thrones</em> got the industry\u2019s attention, and Snodgrass has no doubt that it paved the way for the new show. She told the <em>Observer</em>: \u201cIt\u2019s been crucial. The success of <em>Game of Thrones</em> and George have really helped. People now see the possibilities in this other major work.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"7754e534688b2594e15f6562054d7e6e830dcfa8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7754e534688b2594e15f6562054d7e6e830dcfa8/0_0_1138_1422/800.jpg\" alt=\"Author Melinda Snodgrass\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Melinda Snodgrass has collaborated on Wild Cards with George RR Martin for 30 years.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Handout</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><em>Wild Cards</em> imagines a world that was intentionally infected by an alien virus in 1946. Ninety per cent of those infected die. Of the remaining 10%, most are deformed (called Jokers) and 1% (called Aces) get superpowers, from flight to mind-reading, which they use for both good and evil.</p> <p>The characters include the Sleeper, whose DNA-changing virus has enabled him to go without sleep for months on end. When he does sleep, he can wake up with a completely new face and new powers. Snodgrass said: \u201cIt is a superhero franchise, but it\u2019s different in that it\u2019s far more realistic than some superhero films, and grittier. If you die in the <em>Wild Cards</em> books, you don\u2019t get to come back. We want death to have consequences.\u201d</p> <p>The books also offer analogies for our times. Through the Jokers, for example, they explore persecution and bigotry. \u201cEntertainment works best when it reflects what\u2019s happening in the real world and when it allows people to reflect on it, perhaps in a safer space where it doesn\u2019t feel so charged,\u201d said Snodgrass.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>George and I created Wild Cards, and then invited a bunch of writers to come play in the sandbox</p> <footer> <cite>Melinda Snodgrass</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>She added that some of the stories mirror real life: \u201cIt\u2019s not just about superheroes fighting super villains. We have political thrillers, with one about an unfit candidate trying to obtain the highest office in the US, for example. Most of it is set in the US, but we try to look at world issues. Interestingly enough, one of our books predicted the rise of a caliphate before Isis actually arose.\u201d</p> <p>While Martin and Snodgrass have each written some of the books, they have built up a consortium of about 30 authors, all creating stories set in the same world.</p> <p>The first book was published in 1986, 10 years before Martin\u2019s first <em>Game of Thrones </em>book in 1996. Such is the series\u2019 popularity that the 23rd volume will be released later this month, and Martin and Snodgrass are already working on the next three. Beyond publication worldwide, the books have inspired spin-off comics and games.</p> <p>An announcement that <em>Wild Cards </em>is to be developed with Universal Cable Productions was made last week by Martin, who said that \u201cthere are thousands of stories to be told\u201d.</p> <p>As he has an exclusive development deal with HBO, he has handed <em>Wild Cards</em> to Snodgrass and producer Gregory Noveck: \u201cThey know and love the <em>Wild Cards</em> universe almost as well as I do,\u201d he said.</p> <p>They hope to begin shooting next year. \u201cIt is very exciting. George and I created <em>Wild Cards</em>, and then invited a bunch of writers to come play in the sandbox. Then it\u2019s just grown and grown,\u201d said Snodgrass. Her passion for fantasy and science fiction began as a child, lapping up books by JRR Tolkien and watching <em>Star Trek</em>. \u201cI wanted to go to the stars.\u201d</p> <p>That passion never left her. She gave up a legal career to become a writer and was a story editor and executive script consultant on <em>Star Trek: The Next Generation</em>. Like Martin, she lives in New Mexico, where she trains horses and rides them in competition. Her latest science fiction novel, <em>The High Ground</em>, has just been published by Titan Books.</p> <p>She says she had always seen the screen potential of <em>Wild Cards</em>. The emphasis was always the emotional content, dialogue and \u201ccharacters with whom people can identify and care about, even if you may hate them\u201d.</p>",

  "<p>Lawyers for nine men said to have been repeatedly sexually abused at school have accused <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/aug/04/dame-lowell-goddard-resigns-as-head-of-child-sexual-abuse-inquiry\" title=\"\">Justice Lowell Goddard</a> of treating their clients with contempt and costing them money by \u201cwalking off\u201d from the troubled child abuse inquiry.</p> <p>The men who attended Stanhope Castle approved school in Co Durham travelled to the high court in London, days before the judge from New Zealand resigned, to offer evidence as to why they should take part in the independent inquiry into child sex abuse.</p> <p>Even though the men \u2013 one of whom has been bed-bound for more than a decade \u2013 are vulnerable individuals who claim to have been \u201cseriously and repeatedly sexually abused\u201d as children, they were not offered any resolution on their application for \u201ccore participant\u201d status before Goddard quit.</p> <p>Their lawyer, David Enright of Howe &amp; Co solicitors, has written to Keith Vaz, chair of the Commons home affairs select committee, to complain about the treatment of his clients by the judge, who was on an annual pay package of \u00a3500,000. In a letter obtained by this newspaper, Enright says: \u201cMy clients were shocked that, subsequently and just days after they had made their renewed application for core participant status to Justice Goddard, she resigned with immediate effect.</p> <p>\u201cAt no time, in the interim, did she consider it appropriate to determine my clients\u2019 applications, which had been made before her and after a number of my clients had travelled to London to be present in the high court ...</p> <p>\u201cMy clients rightly consider it entirely unacceptable for a senior judge to, seemingly, simply walk off the job (or be asked to leave her job) before determining their applications for core participant status.\u201d It is understood that Vaz, who has called on Goddard to explain her resignation to his select committee, will question the judge over her treatment of the men.</p> <p>Goddard has not yet given full reasons for her resignation, but she has said that conducting such an inquiry was \u201cnot an easy task\u201d.</p> <p>It has been suggested that she was effectively pushed out over doubts over her knowledge of UK law. It was also reported that Goddard had spent more than 70 days working abroad or on holiday during her time in charge of the inquiry.</p> <p>An inquiry spokesman said that the 67-year-old judge, who was appointed in April 2015, had spent 44 days in New Zealand and Australia on inquiry business and was entitled to 30 days\u2019 annual leave.</p> <p>Meanwhile concerns have been raised about the appointment of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/aug/11/child-abuse-inquiry-prof-alexis-jay-to-take-over-from-lowell-goddard\" title=\"\">Alexis Jay, </a>who was on a panel of advisers to the inquiry, as the new chair.</p> <p>Phil Frampton, of the White Flowers campaign, an umbrella organisation for survivors\u2019 groups, said: \u201cThe new chair of the child sex abuse inquiry, Alexis Jay, has 30 years of working as a senior social work executive in Scotland.</p> <p>\u201cHas anybody thought to ask the home secretary what will happen when Ms Jay is called up before the Scottish child abuse inquiry, either as a witness or as a defendant, in regard for example to cover-ups, failures to act, etc?</p> <p>\u201cGiven Alexis Jay is very likely to have to answer to the Scottish child sex abuse inquiry, this could leave the UK [independent child abuse inquiry] in ruins again.</p> <p>\u201cThere is once again a clear conflict of interest, imperilling the authority of the inquiry and its very existence. After three bungled appointments, the government is totally irresponsible with the inquiry \u2013 to such an extent one can only draw conclusions that Theresa May and Co have been willing it to fail from the&#xa0;off.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>My dad was the first in his family to go to university. <em>His</em> father worked on a fishmonger\u2019s counter. I was the first to go on my mother\u2019s side. She left school at 15 to get a job. My dad passed his 11-plus, went to grammar school and on to university, a transformative experience that led to a career in academia and public service.</p> <p>But so many of his friends in the Rhondda of the 1950s were not so lucky. They failed their 11-plus and headed off to the secondary modern, their life course set before they even entered their teens, the vast majority denied the benefits of education beyond 16.</p> <p>On a different day, my dad might have failed and changed the course of his entire life. That wouldn\u2019t have been right and we cannot return to such a two-tier system. We can\u2019t judge the effectiveness of an education system by looking only at the winners and forgetting the people selective education didn\u2019t select.</p> <p>I went to university, too. I got there after attending a couple of ordinary comprehensive schools, Coed-y-Lan in Pontypridd and Barry Comp, which educated kids regardless of background or ability. They gave me the start I needed in life. I even met my wife at one of them.</p> <p>The point is that they prove you don\u2019t need selection to give children the opportunities they need to maximise their potential. You need good, properly resourced schools, good teachers, a rigorous curriculum and, most importantly, high expectations for everyone, not the low expectations that say that you can know by age 11 what a child has the right to aspire to and achieve.</p> <p>Education can be the key to unlocking social mobility in a country that\u2019s unequal. But if you want to maximise the role of education in raising people up, regardless of background, then bringing back selection through grammar schools, as Theresa May is proposing, is absolutely the last thing we should do.</p> <p>It\u2019s hard to think of a more backward educational step. Under my leadership, the Labour party will block any attempt by the Tories to increase selective schooling and to roll out more grammar schools.</p> <p>But I won\u2019t stop there. Grammar schools are only one part of the unequal system that gives some children opportunities that others are denied. For those who can afford it, private schools offer a head start, the chance of a top-quality education with the best facilities and resources and access to old-school-tie networks.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I\u2019ll put the money from ending the charitable status of private schools towards re-opening Children\u2019s Centres</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>It\u2019s deeply unfair that, on top of this privilege, the government gives fee-charging schools extra tax breaks that save them millions of pounds every year, entrenching inequality by granting private schools charitable status. At the same time, the Tories are cutting support for the most disadvantaged children, making this elite perk look especially perverse.</p> <p>On my watch, there will be no cautions or caveats about whether a private school is charitable or not, this wealthfare will end. Scrapping the subsidy for privileged private schools will raise hundreds of millions of pounds. And, if I\u2019m the next Labour prime minister, I\u2019ll put every penny of that into Sure Start, one of Labour\u2019s proudest achievements and one of the most powerful antidotes to educational injustice.</p> <p>Sure Start has it all. Through a relentless focus on early years\u2019 care and education, it tackles multiple inequalities \u2013 that\u2019s why the Tories hate it so much. And Theresa May is no supporter either. In 2010, she promised a \u201cmore focused\u201d Sure Start. What she meant, of course, was a reduced Sure Start, a reversal of Labour investment and mass closure of children\u2019s centres \u2013 800 shut down by the Tories in just six years.</p> <p>That\u2019s 800 communities where children from disadvantaged backgrounds have had their disadvantage compounded. Where mothers and fathers have seen the ambitions of their children curtailed. And where hundreds of thousands of parents have had their living standards squeezed even further in the name of Tory austerity.</p> <p>That\u2019s why I\u2019ll put the money from ending the charitable status of private schools towards reopening the children\u2019s centres the Tories have callously, and carelessly, closed.</p> <p>Callous, because of the effect closures have had: worse mental health for parents, worse outcomes for families and more dysfunctional relationships. And careless, because spending on Sure Start is an investment that pays for itself. An investment in our children and in the skills and productivity of the next generation of workers.</p> <p>I want all children to get access to the opportunities my dad had and so many others are denied. By blocking selection in schools, by ending subsidies for private schools and by expanding Sure Start, Labour can fight many of the disadvantages that Theresa May\u2019s Tories will entrench. With me as leader, we won\u2019t just talk about it \u2013 we\u2019ll do it.</p>",

Who has beaten death for another day?\u201d</p> <p>Once I have made sure we didn\u2019t lose anyone in the morning attacks, I head out of the house on my motorbike. I bought it after the siege started because I couldn\u2019t afford petrol for the car any more. Sometimes I offer a kind of free public taxi service to people stuck in the streets, because fuel shortages have shut down so much of our transport network.</p> <p>I\u2019ve been working recently on some projects to help besieged civilians to survive for longer, particularly small household farming. We consulted friends who have become \u201csiege experts\u201d after years cut off in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jun/01/syria-crisis-first-aid-convoy-enters-besieged-daraya-since-2012\">Daraya</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/mar/14/syria-chemical-weapons-attacks-almost-1500-killed-report-united-nations\">Eastern Ghouta</a> and growing food was their top advice, so we did it. We bought a lot of farming containers and planted tomato, aubergine and squash, which we got from the local council. We have handed them out across different neighbourhoods now and encouraged some aid organisations to do the same.</p> <p>Even after just a week under siege, markets had already run out of fuel and most basic foods, and if you can find supplies, prices are so high. A kilogram of potatoes has gone up four times in price, from 125 Syrian pounds (45p) to 600 Syrian pounds.</p> <p>I now eat only one meal a day, usually boiled beans or pasta, in the middle of the night. I can\u2019t sleep when I\u2019m too hungry, so I delay my meal until then so that I can get some rest afterwards.</p> <p>It was strange hearing about Russian suggestions of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/03/syrian-rebels-advance-on-assad-forces-aleppo-siege\">\u201chumanitarian corridors\u201d</a> to get us civilians out of the siege, because the areas they were bombing hard were the areas chosen for the supposed escape passages.</p> <p>After two weeks, when the revolutionaries declared an assault to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/06/syria-rebels-unite-break-aleppo-siege\">break the siege of Aleppo</a>, we couldn\u2019t believe it and every single person I know went to the street asking around how he or she could help.</p> <p>Some people started gathering tyres to burn on rooftops, and in the streets, to try to create enough smoke to blind the killing jets. The children made it into a game, and raced around the streets begging people for more, happy to be outside again after days of heavy bombing when parents and teachers had ordered them to stay underground.</p> <p>I\u2019d been out distributing the boxes of seedling plants with my friend, Samar, who works with the aid group Space of Hope. Like me she has left her daughters in Turkey and hasn\u2019t seen them for months, because she chose to come back to help Aleppo. Everyone knows her, and she knows everyone, but the siege is particularly difficult for her.

  "<h2>Championship </h2> <ul> <li>Rafael Ben\u00edtez\u2019s harrowing start to life in the Championship continues, as it does for his <strong>Newcastle United</strong> players. For Ben\u00edtez, it must all feel a world away from the days of winning the Champions League with Liverpool and Europa League with Chelsea. Newcastle slumped to defeat at home to <strong>Huddersfield Town, </strong>after Jack Payne scored the visitors\u2019 winner to ensure Newcastle\u2019s winless start to life in the second-tier continues, despite Dwight Gayle\u2019s first goal for the club \u2013 albeit a rebound after his missed penalty. \u201cWe have to realise where we are and what we have to do,\u201d said Ben\u00edtez, after his team were <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/aug/13/newcastle-huddersfield-championship-match-report\">booed off in front of more than 52,000 fans at St James\u2019 Park.</a></li> </ul> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/aug/13/newcastle-huddersfield-championship-match-report\">Newcastle United feel the pain as Jack Payne wins it for Huddersfield</a> </p> </aside>  <ul> <li>In contrast to the miserable mood that continues to languish around Tyneside, the feel-good factor is in full swing at <strong>Bristol City</strong>. The Chelsea striker, Tammy Abraham, scored his second goal of the game in the 95th minute to secure a late victory at <strong>Burton Albion</strong>. The England Under-19 international, who joined City on loan on the eve of the new season has scored four goals in three matches to help Lee Johnson\u2019s side to the top of the Championship alongside Huddersfield and <strong>Fulham</strong>, who celebrated back-to-back wins at <strong>Preston</strong>. </li> <li><strong>Aston Villa</strong> supporters are unlikely to have forgotten last season just yet but their new Twitter-friendly owner, Dr Tony Xia, has outlined big plans for the Midlands club. Villa are not there yet, but a comfortable 3-0 win at home to <strong>Rotherham United</strong> goes some way to helping them achieve their aim of earning an instant return to the Premier League. Rudy Gestede\u2019s aerial ability helped Villa into cruise control and a two-goal lead before Jack Grealish wrapped things up with six minutes remaining.</li> <li>Elsewhere, Walter Zenga\u2019s <strong>Wolves</strong> had the beating of Jaap Stam\u2019s <strong>Reading</strong> \u2013 it still feels weird saying that. Stam will have been infuriated by sloppy defending at set-pieces that allowed Matt Doherty and Joe Mason to secure a 2-0 win. Garry Monk\u2019s tenure at <strong>Leeds United</strong> is not going as planned just yet either, after Michael Morrison\u2019s second-half winner for <strong>Birmingham City</strong> left Leeds pointless in the second tier. <strong>Barnsley</strong> breezed past <strong>Derby County</strong> 2-0 and <strong>Brentford</strong> beat <strong>Ipswich Town</strong> at Griffin Park by the same scoreline. \u201cI\u2019m never one for making a big scene in the public domain, but we have to do better,\u201d said the Derby manager Nigel Pearson, seemingly ignoring last season\u2019s headlines. <strong>Norwich City</strong> held <strong>Sheffield Wednesday</strong> at Carrow Road in a goalless draw and it just gets worse for Owen Coyle at <strong>Blackburn Rovers</strong>, who have now shipped seven goals in two league games after a 3-0 defeat at <strong>Wigan Athletic.</strong><br></li> </ul>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0e5d4e9cdd2015bbf93282de8130788a80078e1f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0e5d4e9cdd2015bbf93282de8130788a80078e1f/0_118_4496_2698/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Chelsea\u2019s Tammy Abraham scored the third and fourth goals of his loan spell at Bristol City.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Chelsea\u2019s Tammy Abraham scored the third and fourth goals of his loan spell at Bristol City.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Stephenson/JMP/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>League One</h2> <ul> <li><strong>Gillingham</strong> look every inch like a team capable of playing a league higher, partly due to the arrival of some marquee signings. Paul Konchesky, Jamie O\u2019Hara and Jay Emmanuel-Thomas have injected experience and a touch of class into Justin Edinburgh\u2019s squad, who secured a 2-0 win over <strong>Bury</strong> to move top of the division after two matches. On Gillingham\u2019s tails are <strong>Bolton Wanderers</strong>, the only other team with a 100% record in League One after their 2-1 win at <strong>AFC Wimbledon</strong>. A decade ago, that fixture would have been not only unlikely but impossible.</li> <li>If only all debuts were like Kieran Agard\u2019s at <strong>MK Dons</strong>, eh? The striker, signed from Bristol City for a club-record fee on Friday, scored two goals to secure a draw against <strong>Millwall</strong>. Ched Evans has had a good start to life at <strong>Chesterfield</strong> too, after scoring his second goal for the club in a 3-1 victory at home to <strong>Swindon Town</strong>. <strong>Walsall</strong>, who drew 0-0 at <strong>Oldham</strong>, and <strong>Scunthorpe United</strong>, who secured a point at<strong> Fleetwood Town</strong>, make up the numbers in the play-off picture at this very, very early stage.</li> <li>It\u2019s not been pretty at <strong>Charlton Athletic</strong> of late, but they mustered their first point of the season at home to <strong>Northampton Town</strong>, courtesy of skipper Johnnie Jackson. Another former top-flight club, <strong>Sheffield United</strong>, continue to stutter under their new manager, Chris Wilder, after Billy Sharp rescued a late draw against <strong>Rochdale</strong> at Brammall Lane. Elsewhere, <strong>Coventry City</strong> and <strong>Shrewsbury Town</strong> played out a goalless draw, <strong>Bradford City</strong> won 1-0 at <strong>Peterborough United</strong> and <strong>Port Vale</strong> coasted past <strong>Southend United</strong> 2-0.</li> </ul> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/aug/12/brighton-hove-albion-nottingham-forest-championship-match-report\">Glenn Murray\u2019s double eases Brighton to victory over Nottingham Forest</a> </p> </aside>  <h2>League Two</h2> <ul> <li>So, anybody really can beat anybody. Even down in the rough and tough of the fourth tier of English football, where no team has won their opening two matches of the new season. Nine teams have four points, including <strong>Luton Town</strong> and <strong>Yeovil Town</strong> who played out a 1-1 draw at Kenilworth Road, where former team-mates Nathan Jones and Darren Way went head-to-head in the dugout. John Akinde, who scored 24 goals last season, was on the scoresheet as <strong>Barnet</strong> secured a 2-0 home win over <strong>Accrington Stanley</strong>. </li> <li><strong>Portsmouth</strong> are still in search of their first win of the season after a goalless draw at <strong>Crewe</strong>. The pressure is on Paul Cook\u2019s side, who are in their fourth season in League Two, to finally win promotion this year after last season\u2019s play-off disappointment against <strong>Plymouth Argyle</strong>. \u201cI thought we started the game really well, I thought we were bright but we\u2019ve got to score in those spells,\u201d said Cook post-match. Argyle\u2019s six-hour coach journey home will probably be rather quiet after they lost out 1-0 at <strong>Carlisle United</strong>, where Reggie Lambe scored the only goal of the game. Former Eastleigh defender Jamie Turley scored his first goal for <strong>Newport County</strong>, who won 1-0 at <strong>Leyton Orient</strong>. And last week\u2019s joy was short-lived for<strong> Blackpool, </strong>who lost 2-1 away at fellow seaside club<strong> Morecambe. </strong></li> <li><strong>Exeter City </strong>may have triumphed in midweek against Walsall in the EFL Cup, but they are yet to register their first points of the new season. Exeter, who left 15-year-old Ethan Ampadu on the bench after his man-of-the-match display on Tuesday, lost out to two goals in 120 seconds from <strong>Hartlepool\u2019s</strong> Michael Woods and Billy Paynter. <strong>Colchester</strong> overcame <strong>Cambridge United</strong> at home 2-0 while <strong>Doncaster Rovers</strong> drew 1-1 with <strong>Crawley Town</strong>. Elsewhere, <strong>Wycombe</strong> beat <strong>Grimsby Town</strong> 2-1, Notts County drew with Stevenage, while <strong>Cheltenham</strong> secured a point at <strong>Mansfield</strong>. </li> </ul>",
  "<p>Police investigating nine nighttime drive-by shootings in Phoenix have confirmed they recovered bullet casings from at least three of the crime scenes and received detailed vehicle descriptions from witnesses.<br></p> <p>The shootings, which occurred from mid-March to mid-July, are believed to be the work of a serial killer described by witnesses as a lanky man in his early 20s.</p> <p>Investigators are leaving open the possibility that someone else may have participated in the attacks. Documents released last week showed that shell casings were found at each of the three crime scenes.</p> <p>In all, seven people have been killed and two others wounded. Witnesses have described hearing anywhere between five and 10 shots, but no one has seen any of the bullets actually being fired.</p> <p>Police had initially believed that the string of attacks had ended in mid-June when the assailant fatally shot two women and a 12-year-old girl in their driveway.</p> <p>But police have since added a ninth shooting to the pattern \u2013 an 11 July incident in which the gunman fired at a man and a four-year-old boy sitting in a car. Neither was struck. </p> <p>But the addition of the new incident suggests the shooter, or shooters, were still active even after Phoenix law enforcement stepped up their efforts and issued a city wide alert.<br></p> <p>Earlier this month, Phoenix Police sergeant Jonathan Howard warned: \u201cThe threat is still alive.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe don\u2019t want to see anybody else get hurt. We want to make an arrest and stop this,\u201d he added. \u201cWe\u2019re fortunate in this new incident that nobody was injured.\u201d</p> <p>Based on witness statements to police, detectives believe the suspect has access to several cars: one appears to be a white Cadillac or Lincoln, another a late 90s brown Nissan, and a third may be an early 2000s black BMW. Police confirmed that they\u2019ve looked into whether the killer could have access to a used car lot.</p> <p>In each incident, the victims have been attacked in the working-class Maryvale section of Phoenix, near their car or home and in the evening or very early morning hours.</p> <p>The victims include a 16-year-old boy wounded while walking in the street at 11.30pm on 17 March; a 21-year-old male shot standing near his car on the street at 11.30pm a day later; 21-year-old Diego Verdugo-Sanchez, killed 1 April while visiting his pregnant fianc\u00e9e\u2019s family; 55-year-old Krystal Annette White, found dead of a gunshot on 19 April; 32-year-old Horacio Pena, fatally shot 3 June after returning home from work; and 19-year-old Manuel Castro Garcia, murdered outside his home on 10 June.</p> <p>In the final fatal incident, on 12 June, 33-year-old Stefanie Ellis, her 12-year-old daughter Maleah and Ellis\u2019 31-year-old friend, Angela Linner, were killed outside their home. In that incident, a witness told police she saw a man wearing a white shirt and red shorts as he stood beside a dark-colored sedan. A witness also told police that it wasn\u2019t unusual for the victims to sit in a parked car listening to music. </p> <p>Investigators are checking whether neighbors have security camera and pursuing hundreds of leads, and have composed a sketch of teh suspect.</p> <p>Police later found shell casings inside the victim\u2019s vehicle, indicating the women were all shot at close range. Police also found nearly $3,000 cash inside the victim\u2019s vehicle, indicating that robbery was not a motive. That same night, the killer targeted an empty pick-up truck.</p> <p>\u201cThis guy shot and killed a 12-year-old girl,\u201d Howard told <a href=\"http://www.wral.com/phoenix-neighborhood-on-edge-as-serial-killer-prowls/15923671/\">local WRAL news</a>. \u201cWe hope someone else\u2019s conscience catches up with them.\u201d</p>",

  "<p>At one stage of this curtainraiser Middlesbrough looked as if they had never left the Premier League, despite a seven-year hiatus. Yet whereas \u00c1lvaro Negredo had raised the Riverside roof early on with a debut goal Boro were hanging on somewhat at the end of the game and a point ended up being a satisfactory start to their season.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/aug/13/burnley-swansea-premier-league-match-report\">Leroy Fer strikes late as Swansea spoil Burnley\u2019s top-flight return</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Stoke City were well off the pace in the opening half but Xherdan Shaqiri\u2019s free-kick in the 67th minute ensured Mark Hughes\u2019s side left Teesside with a point which, on reflection, will probably have satisfied both teams.</p> <p>Aitor Karanka watched Middlesbrough play some sparkling football early on, with Gast\u00f3n Ram\u00edrez particularly impressive, and there were plenty of encouraging signs for the Spaniard, with the exception of an injury to the new signing Marten de Roon. Negredo showed a predatory instinct to bundle in while Middlesbrough\u2019s defence stood up to late pressure, something they may have to get used to on their return to the top flight.</p> <p>The Riverside was reverberating with optimism before kick-off and that fractured period last spring was all but&#xa0;forgotten as a pristine pitch beckoned, while banners were unfurled and a plane flew overhead. This moment had been a long time in the waiting and Middlesbrough\u2019s supporters were going to enjoy it.</p> <p>Yet while spirits were high, there was an air of uncertainty about how Karanka\u2019s team would stand up to the challenge of an established Premier League side full of international quality. Middlesbrough had four new players in the starting lineup but, if there was any&#xa0;apprehension beforehand about a transitional, gelling period, it was soon allayed.</p> <p>Boro came out of the blocks flying and were the superior side throughout a first half in which they scored one and hit the post twice. Ram\u00edrez was the standout performer but how Negredo will be thankful for a goal 11 minutes into his career on Teesside.</p> <p>Albert Adomah was at the heart of an excellent team move, retrieving the ball in midfield and building momentum down the left, drifting a high cross to the back post where Ram\u00edrez rose to nod across goal. Negredo, who scored nine goals in 30 league appearances for Manchester City during the 2013-14 season, was in the right place at the right time and bundled the ball in with his shoulder.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bcedee08f96c6fc5772ec49e4ca134c5f8be9b12\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bcedee08f96c6fc5772ec49e4ca134c5f8be9b12/2_35_2836_1701/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u00c1lvaro Negredo makes an early impact on his Premier League return\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u00c1lvaro Negredo makes an early impact on his Premier League return, even if the goal was not the most graceful.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Steve Welsh/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cIt\u2019s important to score when you are a striker, especially for \u00c1lvaro,\u201d said Karanka. \u201cWhen we signed him I said he needed to recover his confidence. Maybe we should have won the game but we can\u2019t forget that three months ago we were playing in the Championship. I\u2019m more than pleased.\u201d</p> <p>The only serious blow for Middlesbrough came in the 18th minute, when their \u00a312m summer signing from Atalanta, De Roon, was forced off with a hamstring injury, yet Adam Forshaw slotted into central midfield with ease.</p> <p>Victor Vald\u00e9s, another debutant, was rarely called into action in the Middlesbrough goal and Karanka\u2019s men could have been two up before half-time, Ram\u00edrez dropping his shoulder to beat Ryan Shawcross before hitting a left-footed shot on to the post; and he hit the woodwork again with a corner.</p> <p>However, the pattern of the game changed. Stoke began to control the ball and, although Middlesbrough were content to play on the break, their lead was soon eradicated.</p> <p>Stoke had not crafted too many chances, other than a determined run from Marko Arnautovic that the Austrian sliced wide, but it was a piece of quality that brought them level.</p> <p>Karanka was furious that Stoke were awarded a free-kick on the edge of the Middlesbrough penalty area as the referee, Kevin Friend, had already played advantage, despite a trip by Adam Clayton. Shaqiri curled a precise effort in off Vald\u00e9s's left-hand post, with the former Barcelona goalkeeper getting a faint touch.</p> <p>Mark Hughes, the Stoke manager, said: \u201cIt was a great strike but it was the least we deserved. We looked strong and dynamic and it shows our pre-season preparation has gone well.

Without anyone to aim for in attack, and no one capable of holding possession in advanced positions, the home side found the ball kept coming back towards them. They defended well, with Gueye in particular winning applause for his neat interventions and efficient distribution, though Tottenham are not the sort of team one wants camped on the edge of one\u2019s penalty area.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/aug/13/middlesbrough-stoke-city-premier-league-match-report\">Middlesbrough denied win as Xherdan Shaqiri clinches point for Stoke City</a> </p> </aside>  <p>That said, Harry Kane was not being brought into the game regularly enough from a Spurs point of view and, when the striker took matters into his own hands and dumped Funes Mori on his backside with a meaty shoulder charge, he was rather harshly pulled up for a foul.

A late Lamela effort was deflected on to the bar by Holgate but somehow Everton held on.

  "<p>In a side street in the heart of Athens, two siblings are hard at work. For the past year they have run their hairdressing business \u2013 an enterprise that was once located on a busy boulevard \u2013 out of a two-bedroom flat. The move was purely financial: last summer, as it became clear that Greeks would be hit by yet more austerity to foot the bill for saving their country from economic collapse, they realised their business would go bust if it continued operating legally.</p> <p>\u201cWe did our sums and understood that staying put made no sense at all,\u201d says one sibling. \u201cIf we didn\u2019t [offer] receipts, if we avoided taxes and social security contributions, we could just about make ends meet.\u201d</p> <p>They are far from being alone. A year after debt-stricken Greece <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/aug/14/greece-edges-third-bailout-positive-signals-germany\" title=\"\">received its third financial rescue</a> in the form of international funding worth \u20ac86bn, such survival techniques have become commonplace. For a middle class eviscerated by relentless rounds of cuts and tax rises \u2013 the price of the country\u2019s ongoing struggle to avert bankruptcy \u2013 the draconian conditions attached to the latest bailout are invariably invoked in their defence. Measures ranging from the overhaul of the pension system to indirect duties \u2013 slapped on beer, fuel and almost everything in between \u2013 and a controversial increase in VAT are similarly cited by Greeks now reneging on loan repayments, property taxes and energy bills.</p> <p>Against a backdrop of monumental debt \u2013 \u20ac320bn, or 180% of GDP, the accumulation of decades of profligacy \u2013 fatalism is fast replacing pessimism on the streets. \u201cOur country is doomed,\u201d sighs Savvas Tzironis, summing up the mood. \u201cEverything goes from bad to worse.\u201d</p> <p>Close to half a million Greeks are believed to have migrated since the crisis begun, thanks to the searing effect of persistent unemployment (at just under 24%, the highest in Europe) and an economy that has shed more than a third of its total output over the past six years. The nation has been assigned some \u20ac326bn in bailout loans since May 2010 \u2013 the biggest rescue programme in global financial history. Yet the fear that it is locked in an economic death spiral was given further credence last week when Eurobank analysts announced that consumption and exports had also fallen, by 6.4% and 7.2%, in the second quarter of the year.</p> <p>The duration and depth of the recession is such that the World Bank now compares it to the slumps seen in eastern European countries in the early 1990s. The poorest 20% of Greece\u2019s 11 million people have suffered a 42% drop in disposable income since 2009.</p> <p>\u201cIf we continue down this road, a fourth, even a fifth, bailout should be expected,\u201d says Aristides Hatzis, associate professor of law and economics at Athens University. \u201cI don\u2019t see any progress. The economy is stagnant, the private sector devastated, the public administration underfunded and ineffective. And there is always the spectre of Grexit at the end of the tunnel.\u201d</p> <p>The 14 August bailout deal was meant to have put paid to that. Announcing the agreement after months of negotiations that not only brought Athens to the brink of euro exit but provoked the continent\u2019s biggest existential crisis in recent times, EU commission president Jean-Claude Juncker chirpily announced that Greece was \u201cirreversibly\u201d part of the euro area. The 19-member currency bloc had \u201clooked into the abyss\u201d, but henceforth, he said, there was no looking back.</p> <p>A year on, however, there are many who would argue otherwise.</p> <p>In many ways, the Greek debt drama has disappeared in the folds of other crises now stalking Europe: in quick succession, fractious debate has moved from the influx of refugees through the Aegean islands to repeated terrorist attacks and Britain\u2019s shock referendum vote to leave the EU.</p> <p>The runaway train that was carrying Greeks downhill at the height of the crisis has slowed down to the point where loss and sacrifice have almost been normalised. The gradual relaxation of capital controls \u2013 imposed to prevent a run on banks as fears grew that Greece might crash out of the eurozone \u2013 has helped reinforce the sense that the economy has returned to a path of stability. The global lack of appetite for any more Greek drama is such that eurozone finance ministers disbursed a whopping \u20ac10.3bn in emergency loans in June and made an unprecedented promise of debt relief when the current programme finishes in 2018, on condition that Athens presses ahead with yet more unpopular reforms. The country is predicted to see growth of 2.5% next year.</p> <p>\u201cNo economy can withstand endless recession and stagnation,\u201d says George Pagoulatos, professor of European politics and economy at Athens University. \u201cAt some point there could be a change of preferences, with forces who would want to continue outside the euro,\u201d he adds. \u201cIt is anyone\u2019s bet what will happen if the economy doesn\u2019t [exhibit] a strong recovery in 2017.\u201d</p> <p>But few believe it will get better before it gets worse. After promising to eradicate austerity, the once popular leftwing prime minister, Alexis Tsipras, is now a reviled figure.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"6b04447f79f104bdf86d174e242dd87dc4dcde96\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6b04447f79f104bdf86d174e242dd87dc4dcde96/0_0_4928_2957/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Greek prime minister Alexis Tsipras speaking outside parliament in July.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Greek prime minister Alexis Tsipras speaking outside parliament in July.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Louisa Gouliamaki/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Anti\u2013EU sentiment is on the rise. In October, 70% thought it better for Greece to remain in the single currency; by July those backing the euro had fallen to 50%. Real recovery can only come if the country\u2019s staggering debt burden is reduced. Without debt relief, the International Monetary Fund, which has yet to participate in the latest rescue, believes interest payments on the growing pile will account for 60% of the budget by 2060. In an excoriating review of its own role in the crisis, the IMF\u2019s internal watchdog recently admitted to a litany of mistakes, including the failure to foresee the recessionary impact of austerity on an economy curtailed by corruption and vested interests.</p> <p>Almost all agree that last summer\u2019s bailout simply kicks the can down the road \u2013 an art EU mandarins have mastered since Greece\u2019s ordeal by financial collapse begun. Europe\u2019s weakest link will face further tumult when the latest measures kick in this autumn and the Syriza-led government is forced to enact contentious employment reforms to secure a further \u20ac2.8bn in loans.</p> <p>\u201cI wish I could say Greece has been on the mend over the last year,\u201d says George Papaconstantinou, who oversaw the country\u2019s first rescue package as finance minister. \u201cInstead we are witnessing a double-dip recession that can be wholly ascribed to Syriza\u2019s first six months in office, which almost destroyed the country and certainly set it back many years.\u201d</p> <p>More than ever, he says, Greece needs large-scale foreign investment to kickstart growth \u2013 investment that is unlikely to happen in the face of government hostility to investors, both domestic and foreign.</p> <p>Papaconstantinou, who has chronicled the crisis in a memoir, <em>Game Over, </em>argues that last summer\u2019s lifeline was all the more tragic for being unnecessary. \u201cWhat really differentiates the latest bailout from the previous ones is that this time around, it could have been avoided,\u201d he writes in the book. \u201cIt became necessary because of a mix of ideological blindness, lack of understanding of basic eurozone rules, unforgivable brinkmanship and plain incompetence during the first six months Syriza was in power.\u201d</p> <p>A year on and Greece, though quiet, remains as febrile as ever on the frontline of the euro storm.</p> <h2>Coping with crisis</h2> <p><strong>How other countries gripped by the eurozone\u2019s problems have fared</strong></p> <p><strong>Italy</strong> In the wake of the British referendum, Italy is Europe\u2019s most pressing problem. The country has lost competitiveness since joining the euro and has experienced two lost economic decades during which growth has barely risen. The country\u2019s banks are awash with bad debts. Prime minister Matteo Renzi has called a referendum on constitutional reform for October. Defeat on this would spark a political crisis, and probably an economic crisis as well.</p> <p><strong>Spain </strong>Along with Italy, this was the country that looked to be in the most trouble in 2012, when interest rates on its bonds rose to dangerously high levels. Since then, Spain has performed the stronger, and in the second quarter of 2016, its economy grew by 0.7% compared with Italy\u2019s 0.1%. Spain has squeezed domestic costs and taken advantage of a weaker euro to boost its exports. Loose fiscal policy has also helped stimulate activity.</p> <p><strong>Portugal</strong> Like Spain, Portugal\u2019s fiscal policy contravenes eurozone rules; both countries face Brussels sanctions as a result. In most respects, though, Portugal is more akin to Italy than to its Iberian-peninsula neighbour, with a recent record of slow growth, weak productivity and a shaky banking system. As in Italy, the public debt ratio is too high for comfort, and rising.</p> <p><strong>Ireland </strong>Of all the countries to receive bailouts during the euro crisis, Ireland has done the best. Strong growth has resumed, albeit partly thanks to the activities of US-owned multinationals, and unemployment has come down. Two potential problems loom, however. First, the housing market \u2013 the source of Ireland\u2019s financial problems during the crisis \u2013 has started to exhibit bubble-like tendencies again.

One of the men was holding up his arms as he walked, and blood was running off his arms.\u201d<br></p> <p>Upon reaching the police station, one of the refugees collapsed unconscious, prompting one officer to attempt CPR.

Abbott retained the photos.</p> <p>\u201cIt was very tense, they were very angry, but we tried to be respectful, while explaining that I was doing my job taking photos. They actually said to us at one point \u2018what you do now will determine whether you are ever allowed to visit PNG again\u2019,\u201d Abbott said.</p> <p>After being questioned for more than two hours, and forced to supply their passport details, Abbott and Webb were released, but were made to return to the police station the next morning, before they were able to leave Manus Island.</p> <p>Guardian Australia understands that three refugees, all Afghan Hazaras who have been granted refugee status after fleeing the Taliban in their home country, had been on the beach at Lorengau on Wednesday afternoon. </p> <p>One of the men had bought multivitamins at the Lorengau pharmacy but knew the tablets would be confiscated back at the detention centre.

  "<p>The ex-fiancee of Steven Avery, the subject of the Netflix documentary series <em>Making a Murderer</em>, has reportedly expressed fears that her former partner could be released from prison after a judge overturned the murder conviction of his nephew, Brendan Dassey.</p> <p>Avery and Dassey were both found guilty of the 2005 murder of Teresa Halbach of Wisconsin in separate trials, chronicled in the hugely popular documentary series released last year.</p> <p>On Friday, US federal magistrate William Duffin handed down the ruling in Dassey\u2019s case on the grounds that he was coerced into making his original confession. In so doing, the judge called into question the conduct of Dassey\u2019s attorney, Len Kachinsky, as well as those of investigators who he said had elicited an \u201cinvoluntary\u201d confession from the then 16-year-old, who has learning difficulties.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.tmz.com/2016/08/12/making-a-murderer-brendan-dassey-steven-avery-conviction-overturned/\" title=\"\">According to the entertainment news site TMZ</a>, Avery\u2019s former partner Jodi Stachowski said after the judgment that, while she had great sympathy for Dassey and believed the state of Wisconsin had a duty of care towards him \u201cbecause they wilfully destroyed his life\u201d, she feared his potential freedom might put pressure on the courts to release Avery, \u201cwho she firmly believes is guilty of raping and killing\u201d Halbach.</p> <p>TMZ added that, in contrast, Avery\u2019s brother Chuck said that he would not celebrate \u201cuntil the other person wrongly convicted is also freed: his brother\u201d.</p> <p>The reports come amid mounting questions over the impact Dassey\u2019s case will have on that of his uncle, who is also serving life in prison. Avery\u2019s legal team said in a statement that they were \u201cthrilled\u201d for Dassey that his conviction had been overturned. \u201cWe fully expected this outcome from an unbiased court that carefully examined his confession,\u201d they said.</p> <p>Avery\u2019s attorney, Kathleen Zellner, who took up the appeal case in January, added: \u201cSteven Avery is so happy for Brendan. We know when an unbiased court reviews all of the new evidence we have, Steven will have his conviction overturned as well.\u201d</p> <p>Jerry Buting, Avery\u2019s former lawyer, who featured prominently in <em>Making a Murderer</em>, also tweeted that \u201cjustice finally strikes\u201d, adding: \u201cState of Wisconsin should accept federal court decision and drop case against Brendan Dassey. Avery is next. Time to go after real killer.\u201d</p> <p>Steven Drizin, a professor of law at Northwestern University, who pushed to have Dassey\u2019s conviction overturned, told the BBC\u2019s <em>Today</em> programme yesterday: \u201cI thought that this was a confession that was the result of police coercion. These detectives had taken advantage of a young man who had severe learning difficulties. The only facts in the confession had been fed to him by the investigators.\u201d</p> <p>Halbach, a photographer for <em>Auto Trader</em> magazine, went missing on Halloween in 2005 after photographing a vehicle at Avery\u2019s salvage yard. Her charred remains were discovered in a burn pit on the yard 10 days later, along with her Toyota RAV4, mobile phone and car keys. The Netflix documentary brought international attention to the subsequent murder case by exploring issues and procedures in the Manitowoc County sheriff\u2019s department investigation of Avery and Dassey.</p> <p>It also cast doubt on the legal process to convict both men, which led to a significant public backlash against the state of Wisconsin. Following the show\u2019s airing, a petition to investigate and pardon the Averys \u201cand punish the corrupt officials who railroaded these innocent men\u201d was submitted to the White House with more than 120,000 signatures. (A White House spokesperson later said that, since Avery and Dassey were both state prisoners, the president could not pardon them.)</p> <p>Meanwhile, Kachinsky, who was removed from Dassey\u2019s case and later de-certified from the public defender\u2019s office, reported receiving hate mail from Dassey\u2019s supporters. On Friday, Duffin accused the attorney of spending more time talking to the press about the high-profile case than actually communicating with his own client. In his first three weeks as Dassey\u2019s attorney, Kachinsky spent 10 hours speaking to reporters and one hour with Dassey, according to Duffin.</p> <p>If prosecutors do not refile charges within 90 days, Dassey will walk free. While a second series of <em>Making a Murderer</em> is currently in the making, the new ruling is understood not to have been captured on camera.</p>",
  "<p>Troubled by his posts online that praised Isis and his correspondence with militants plotting attacks around the world, Canadian officials began watching Aaron Driver in 2014.</p> <p>They soon went one step further, imposing a strict set of restrictions including reporting regularly to police and staying off social media. </p> <p>But when Driver, 24, released a video in which he pledged allegiance to Isis and warned of an imminent attack on a Canadian city, it was US officials who alerted Canada.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/11/canada-terror-suspect-recorded-martyrdom-video\">Canada terror suspect recorded 'martyrdom video' warning of attack</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cThat would be one of the questions, if I was the minister,\u201d said Ray Boisvert, a former assistant director of intelligence at the Canadian security and intelligence service. \u201cHow come the FBI had to tell us? How much investigative activity was the FBI doing against a Canadian and what can we do, moving forward, to prevent these things from happening?\u201d</p> <p>Within hours of being tipped off by the FBI, the Royal Canadian mounted police (RCMP) had surrounded the home where Driver was living in Strathroy, a small Ontario town some 140 miles south-west of Toronto. </p> <p>Police <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/11/canada-terror-suspect-recorded-martyrdom-video\">watched as a taxi pulled up to the home</a> and Driver got in carrying a backpack and asked to be taken to a shopping mall in the city of London, a 40-minute drive away. As police closed in, Driver detonated an explosive device, leaving the taxi driver with minor injuries and shredding the back seat of the car.</p> <p>One shot was fired by an officer, and an autopsy will be carried out to determine whether Driver died by police gunfire or shrapnel from the explosion. </p> <p>The events have sparked questions over Canada\u2019s capabilities to address homegrown terrorism. One possible explanation is that US law enforcement officials simply have more resources than Canadian agencies, Boisvert said. \u201cThey have a larger span of control over those types of resources, they have more money, they have greater authority to do those things because the level of tolerance in the United States is different from the level of tolerance in Canada.\u201d</p> <p>Police said that while Driver was under supervision, there was no indication in the days leading up the attack that he was planning anything. </p> <p>\u201cMr Driver was one individual among others that had potentially criminal intentions. And our ability to monitor people 24 hours a day and seven days a week simply does not exist \u2013 we can\u2019t do that,\u201d Mike Cabana of the RCMP told reporters. </p> <p>\u201cWhen individuals have intentions such as Mr Driver had, there are no conditions that can be put in place that will prevent them from taking action.\u201d </p> <p>Driver was likely classified as a B-lister, known to authorities but considered a lower risk than others, said Boisvert, illustrating the tough choices facing authorities as they seek to strike a balance between personal liberties, limited resources and public safety. </p> <p>\u201cWe always struggled over: is that person a couch jihadist or are they really going to get off that couch and go do something? At what point do we take this person from tier 2 and move them into tier 1 and start spending hundreds of thousands of resources on them?\u201d </p> <p><span tabindex=\"-1\">Many of those who had met Driver were shocked to find out he was behind this week\u2019s events. \u201cHe was definitely very strong in his views and definitely radicalised</span><span tabindex=\"-1\">. He was a very strong supporter of Isis,\u201d said Lorne Dawson, a University of Waterloo professor who spent two hours speaking to Driver last year.</span></p> <p>\u201cBut he was adamant when we interacted with him that he wouldn\u2019t take action against civilians in Canada and he was adamant that he didn\u2019t believe in what he called vigilante Muslim justice. Something had changed, obviously, in the last few months.\u201d</p> <p>Dawson pointed to the conditions imposed on Driver. A high school dropout who had dabbled in drugs and was estranged from his parents, Driver had forged an identity centred on jihadism. </p> <p>But court-imposed conditions left him in a small town, cut off from the only community he felt he belonged to. \u201cAnd so we think it\u2019s just that he felt he had no other logical alternative. The only thing that meant anything to him was being taken away.\u201d</p> <p>Driver had been using the computers at the public library, said Dawson. \u201cSo he\u2019s isolated, sees what\u2019s happening with Isis, sees what\u2019s happening in Europe, feels like he\u2019s missing out on it, so then started to get frustrated, angry and wanted to reignite this sort of quest.\u201d </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/feb/23/home-jihadi-denmark-radical-islamic-extremism-aarhus-model-scandinavia\">A way home for jihadis: Denmark's radical approach to Islamic extremism</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The case underscores <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jun/18/isis-islamic-state-mothers-for-life\">the need for counter-radicalisation efforts in Canada</a>, akin to what exists in the UK and Denmark, said Dawson, who is also a codirector of the Canadian Network for Research on Terrorism, Security and Society. Those kinds of programs are practically non-existent in Canada, he said.</p> <p>During last year\u2019s election campaign, the Liberals promised to open an office that could roll out counter-radicalisation programs across the country. Dawson\u2019s organisation is currently working with federal officials to lay the groundwork for the initiative. </p> <p>Until then, efforts to defuse extremism are left to those who surround the suspected extremists. The mosque attended by Driver in London, Ontario, said its members made efforts to engage Driver with the aim of changing his perspective. </p> <p>\u201cThe Mosque knew of his views, and chose not to turn a blind eye to the problem of violent extremism,\u201d officials at the mosque said in a statement. \u201cWe engaged him with the hope of changing his views on Islam and to show him the true, peaceful nature of our religion.\u201d </p> <p>The mosque was constantly in contact with police regarding Driver. \u201cWhile he had wrong views about the world, at no time did any officials with the Mosque know or suspect that Aaron was translating those views into any kind of attack,\u201d the statement said. \u201cHe did not display any outward signs of aggression.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Several new studies on so-called \u201cban the box\u201d policies that block employers from discounting job applicants with criminal records have revealed another, even more extensive problem: deep-seated employer discrimination against African Americans. </p> <p>Ban-the-box laws, which prevent employers from asking about criminal history on job applications, have passed in scores of cities, 24 states and the District of Columbia. The laws were intended to reduce the impact of US mass incarceration on hiring as individuals with a criminal record attempt to return to the workplace. Because African Americans are five times more likely than whites to be incarcerated, a major secondary goal of ban-the-box advocates is to reduce the effect of racial disparities in employment. Black unemployment has hovered at almost twice that for white Americans in the US.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/nov/03/ban-the-box-is-a-band-aid-on-a-gaping-wound-that-is-mass-imprisonment\">'Ban the box' is a band-aid on a gaping wound that is mass imprisonment | Steven W Thrasher</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But researchers who have scrutinized the policies have found that, regardless of whether employers ask about criminal history, African Americans face discrimination from employers with ingrained racial biases. </p> <p>\u201cThe core problem raised by the studies is not ban-the-box but entrenched racism in the hiring process, which manifests as racial profiling of African Americans as \u2018criminals\u2019,\u201d said researchers Beth Avery and Maurice Ensellem with the National Employment Law Project,<a href=\"http://www.nelp.org/content/uploads/Policy-Brief-Racial-Profiling-in-Hiring-Critique-New-Ban-the-Box-Studies.pdf\"> in a new study</a> released on Thursday.</p> <p>Other studies released over the past few months have reached the similar conclusion that black Americans may be profiled as criminals.

That in turn, the authors suggested, could lead to a reduction in the hiring of young black and Hispanic men because of racial bias by prospective employers.</p> <p>Doleac, who is also a visiting fellow at the Brookings Institution, a Washington DC-based thinktank, said in a<a href=\"https://www.brookings.edu/opinions/ban-the-box-does-more-harm-than-good/\"> separate piece that ban-the-box had \u201cdone more harm than good\u201d</a>, and should be abandoned as a result.</p> <p>But the NELP researchers, who support \u201cfair-chance employment policies\u201d such as ban-the-box, argue that the reform is a necessary but not sufficient policy response to structural causes of discrimination in the US.</p> <p>The researchers questioned the methodology of the Doleac/Hanson study, but said that even if one were to accept those criticisms of \u201cban-the-box\u201d provisions, it would \u201cmerely reinforce the need for stronger anti-discrimination law enforcement and further policy reforms to help eradicate the underlying discrimination, not a rejection of ban-the-box protections\u201d.</p> <p>The NELP researchers said the two studies underscored the need to push \u201cfor a more robust policy response to both boost job opportunities for people with records and tackle race discrimination in the hiring process\u201d. But, they added, it would be a mistake to lay shortcomings at the foot of \u201cban-the-box\u201d policies.</p> <p>\u201cBan-the-box is working, both by increasing employment opportunities for people with records and by changing employer attitudes toward hiring people with records,\u201d they said.</p> <p>Asked about the criticism, Doleac agreed that \u201cit\u2019s possible that \u2018ban the box\u2019 would be a more effective policy in a world with less racial discrimination\u201d. But, she added: \u201cOur research considers its effects on employment in the world we actually live in.</p> <p>\u201cLaws can hide information, but they don\u2019t prevent employers from caring about the information that\u2019s hidden.\u201d She added that this \u201ctypically hurts already-disadvantaged groups\u201d because of how employers guess.</p> <ul> <li><em>This article was amended on 14 August 2016 to correct a misstated percentage of callbacks for low-skilled black and Hispanic men.</em></li> </ul>",

There was no sign of the direct, physical play Irish teams have so often been criticised for. \u201cUsually there\u2019s relief after winning but this was pure ecstasy,\u201d O\u2019Donnell says. \u201cThe way we played was the stuff of dreams.\u201d</p> <p>Even if Legia advance, it will have been some feat for a team that trains in the evening because several members of the squad have day jobs to supplement their income. They are professional in everything but financial reward.</p> <p>Dane Massey, the left-back, is an electrician, Andy Boyle sells meat and his centre-half partner, Brian Gartland, has been working as a basketball coach. The leading star of their European run has been David McMillan, architect by day, goalscorer by night.</p> <p>Off the field the club relies on volunteers to keep going because there are only two full-time employees. The general manager, Martin Connolly, is the brother of the co-owner but has previously worked as goalkeeping coach and turns his hands to whatever odd jobs need doing. Darren Crawley, the press officer, works 40 hours a week and has been struggling to find time to deal with the increased attention over the past week. \u201cNo one ever thought we would be in this position so quickly from the despair of 2012,\u201d Crawley says. Even Kenny\u2019s assistant manager, Vinny Perth, is part-time.</p> <p>There are other challenges, too. Dundalk are fighting to win a third league title in a row but have lost both games since defeating Bate Borisov, their first consecutive defeats since 2013. Europe is a distraction and, as O\u2019Donnell points out, \u201cwe don\u2019t have the biggest squad\u201d.</p> <p>Retaining their best players has been an issue in the past. Richie Towell, their star in 2015, received an offer he could not refuse to join Brighton in January, but he has found playing time under Chris Hughton a precious commodity.</p> <p>Naturally some are being linked with moves away. When receiving his player of the month award last week, McMillan told the story of a Russian messaging him on Facebook with an unconvincing offer. Yet he would not swap his current position for anything less than the Premier League and, being brutally honest, the 27-year-old said: \u201cThat ain\u2019t going to happen. If a full-time opportunity came, it would have to be really brilliant, because where I am at the moment, as you can see from the last few weeks, doesn\u2019t really get much better.\u201d</p> <p>The biggest challenge, though, may be keeping hold of Kenny. O\u2019Donnell has worked under Michael O\u2019Neill, the Northern Ireland manager, but believes his current boss is incomparable. \u201cStephen is definitely the best man-manager I\u2019ve worked under. He gets the best out of his players, believing in them and making them feel 10-foot tall. To do what he has done, from a blank canvas in four years, is amazing.\u201d</p> <p>O\u2019Donnell is also dedicating their run to the league, which has been maltreated by those in control for far too long, not least the Football Association of Ireland <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2014/oct/13/john-delaney-league-of-ireland\" title=\"\">(FAI) chief executive, John Delaney</a>, who currently earns more than three times the prize money for winning the league title and describes the league as \u201ca difficult child\u201d.</p> <p>Dundalk\u2019s European foray has run parallel to the FAI making a song and dance about offering each club a desultory \u20ac5,000 for strategic planning. Insulted, Derry and St Patrick\u2019s Athletic have turned it down and a grim back and forth has taken place between the latter and the association. For context, Delaney earns \u20ac360,000 per annum having taken a substantial pay cut in recent years, while the association earned more than \u20ac11m in prize money alone from Euro 2016.</p> <p>There is no shortage of well wishers, including the FAI, whose jumping on the bandwagon has not been met kindly by supporters. One other Premier Division club, Wexford Youths, are providing free buses for their fans to bolster the crowd at the Aviva in Dublin on Wednesday night.</p> <p>That will be their third home ground of the campaign because the decrepit Oriel was not up to scratch for the Bate game and Tallaght Stadium is not of a sufficient standard for the play-offs.</p> <p>\u201cThe only way to make people not usually interested in the league sit up and take notice is to do well in Europe,\u201d O\u2019Donnell says. \u201cWe\u2019ve made people do that. We want the league to be respected and there are a lot of very good players \u2013 this is for them. When people say the league is rubbish, it grates on you.\u201d</p>",

  "<p>\u201cPromiscuous boy/You already know/That I\u2019m all yours/what are you waiting for?\u201d If you were a pop radio listener 10 years back, those lyrics have probably already started Nelly Furtado and Timbaland\u2019s 2006 mega-hit <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0J3vgcE5i2o\">Promiscuous</a> running on loop through your brain. The song has one of those diabetes-inducing Abba-worthy pop hooks that get trapped in your skull for months, layered over a staggering, clapping, boinging Timbaland beat. Timbaland raps on the song as well as produces; he and Furtado exchange doofily enthusiastic single entendre witticisms with the lascivious corniness of a Loretta/Conway duet. \u201cYou expect me to just let you hit it/but will you still respect me if you get it?\u201d Furtado half raps, to which Timbaland replies with clumsy off-key innocence: \u201cAll I can do is try/Give me one chance!\u201d Even after a decade of hearing that line, it\u2019s still hard not to giggle; rarely has musical intercourse managed to be so slick and so good-humoredly amateurish at the same time.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0J3vgcE5i2o\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"345\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/0J3vgcE5i2o?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>It\u2019s not just Promiscuous that manages to hit that sweet spot of stapled together heterogenous perfection. Furtado\u2019s whole album, <a href=\"http://www.allmusic.com/album/loose-mw0000400240\">Loose</a>, is a wonder \u2013 and one which still sounds, weirdly, up to date. You can hear touches of Promiscuous\u2019s willingness to be ridiculous in the clunkily beeping background and nerd culture references on Lion Babe\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cypK8nDxR9E\">Wonder Woman</a>. Santigold\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b48Muqp6rkA\">Run the Races</a>, which shimmers across the line between R&amp;B and dream pop, echoes the multi-tracked soundscape of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JnGBs88sL0\">Say it Right</a>, on which Timbaland\u2019s production manages to make you want to boogie and stare off into the distance in glazed bliss. The electronica stutter that shifts Furtado\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DfPvPAbN--E\">Afraid</a> into transcendent romantic euphoria is still an effective trick 10 years later on Mobley\u2019s wonderful <a href=\"https://mobley.bandcamp.com/album/some-other-country-ep\">Tell Me</a>. </p> <p>To some extent, Loose\u2019s continued relevance is just a testimony to Timbaland\u2019s ongoing, ubiquitous shadow. In R&amp;B, on the radio, and everywhere else, his particular mix of awkwardness, smooth polish, and unexpected influences remains a model that everyone wants to emulate, celebrate and claim as their own. </p> <p>Furtado brought something to the project too though. Listening to <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1qwZnJg-ss\">No Hay Igual</a>, you might think what she brought was an interest in Latin music; Furtado is Portuguese-Canadian, and she incorporated some world music touched on her successful but not especially involving 2000 debut <a href=\"http://www.allmusic.com/album/whoa-nelly!-mw0000103677\">Whoa, Nelly!</a> The truth is, though, that Furtado didn\u2019t rely on her heritage for No Hay Igual; she\u2019d never heard of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2005/jul/30/popandrock1\">reggaeton </a>before Pharrell Williams introduced it to her in the studio, five minutes before she wrote the song. The song is a testament not so much to Furtado\u2019s affinity for a particular style as it is to her voracious eclecticism. Like she says, she\u2019s promiscuous.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLolag3YSYU\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/PLolag3YSYU?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>Eclectic promiscuity is often associated with rock; the Beatles, Dylan, the White Stripes and Radiohead are praised for their wide-ranging influences, and their ability to turn variegated source material \u2013 blues, country, folk, Motown, soul \u2013 into a singular swaggering statement. Dance pop\u2019s willingness to pick up whatever is lying around, on the other hand, tends to be dismissed as gimmicky looseness \u2013 a sign not of depth of passion, but of flirtatious fecklessness.</p> <p>It\u2019s worth remembering, though, that \u2013 as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2006/nov/20/guardianobituaries.obituaries2\">Ruth Brown</a> could tell you \u2013 dance pop was rock before rock was rock. Timbaland, an R&amp;B and hip-hop producer, isn\u2019t betraying his tradition, but channeling it by teaming up with a pop/Latin/whatever performer like Furtado in order to make music in whatever cross-genre stew they feel like. In that sense, the most quintessentially Timbaland song on the album is one of the only one\u2019s he didn\u2019t produce; <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VR31Iv7J61o\">In God\u2019s Hands</a>. I\u2019ll admit I hadn\u2019t checked the song credit in a decade, and always assumed that Timbaland had decided to channel McCartney for a bittersweet AOR ballad with tinkly piano and swelling strings. \u201cWe gave a lot/But it wasn\u2019t enough/We got so tired/That we just gave up,\u201d Furtado sings. Exhausted resignation and nostalgia doesn\u2019t sound much like T Mosley, but if you\u2019re promiscuous enough to try anything, why wouldn\u2019t you give cheesy romantic melancholy a fling? </p> <p>The joy of Loose is the enthusiasm with which the collaborators are willing to both play with and shuck off their supposed genre conventions. Furtado embraces the preposterous bigger-than-life gold digger thump of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLolag3YSYU\">Maneater</a>; Timbaland co-produces with Chris Martin of Coldplay to create the heart-on-sleeve broken-hearted psychedelia of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pBo-GL9SRg\">All Good Things (Come to an End</a>), complete with washes of surging ecstasy and dead-on Beatles nod. Timbaland and Furtado will flirt with anything \u2013 which put them squarely in a long line of flirters, from <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEBlaMOmKV4\">Sam Cooke channeling Dylan</a> to Michael Jackson kissing <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ym0hZG-zNOk\">rock guitar</a> to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/jun/01/beyonce-daddy-lessons-country-music\">Beyonc\u00e9 playing with country</a>. Furtado and Timbaland\u2019s collaboration is worth revisiting 10 years on, not because it opened up pop radio or charted a new course, but because its sprawling willingness to go every which way encapsulates its pop moment, which is our pop moment, too. Loose<em> </em>is a celebration of the inspired looseness of pop, or R&amp;B, or hip hop, or rock, or whatever you want to call this promiscuous music we\u2019re listening to.</p>",
  "<p>A sexless female psychiatrist, devoted to her work, encounters a fascinating mentally ill man.

Constance\u2019s devotion to her work is a constant source of comment and crankiness for her more or less amorous colleagues. \u201cYour lack of human and emotional experience is bad for you as a doctor and fatal for you as a woman,\u201d one would-be suitor sneers. The man Constance falls in love with, Ballantyne, an amnesiac possible murderer, is even more pointed. \u201cAs a doctor you irritate me,\u201d he says. \u201cI sit here swooning with love, and then suddenly you ask me a question and I don\u2019t like you anymore.\u201d Ingrid Bergman, you are made for love, not medicine.

There\u2019s been less discussion though, on the way that Harley\u2019s transformation into the Joker\u2019s boy-toy homicidal sexpot is based on a denigration of, and nervousness about, her professional accomplishments. Harley, like Constance before her, is dedicates to her task as a psychiatrist \u2013 but her womanly soul gets in the way of her dry, masculine goals. She starts out wanting to cure the Joker, but soon she\u2019s inadvertently telling him she\u2019ll do anything for him and procuring him a machine gun. Once she\u2019s freed him the Joker electrocutes her skull to drive her insane, but really, the film suggests, there was something wrong with her already. That something is that she\u2019s a woman and therefore easily distracted from her duties by a romance plot.</p> <p>In the 1940s, a woman psychiatrist was still unusual; sexism kept most women out of the professions, and in the postwar period, just gearing up as Spellbound hit theaters, the cult of female domesticity in the US was as pervasive and uncompromising as at any time before or since. You\u2019d think that in 2016, it would be easier, rather than harder, to imagine a woman professional with competence and dignity.</p> <p>In fact, though, Suicide Squad is, if anything, more gratuitously sexist than the Hitchcock film. Yes, Constance falls in love with an amnesiac wanted for murder. But she correctly surmises that he\u2019s innocent, and she does help cure him, even if she has to enlist the help of her patriarchal Freud-like male mentor to do it. That\u2019s a lot more dignified than Harley Quinn, who falls for an avowed mass murderer and proves her devotion to him, and her rejection of her professionalism, by donning little girl stripper drag.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"97422bd838e62f1c1ce899cbcd02d69e1cb3f62c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/97422bd838e62f1c1ce899cbcd02d69e1cb3f62c/0_0_6140_4912/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Suicide Squad: anxiety and a weird finger-wagging moralism\" width=\"1000\" height=\"800\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Suicide Squad: anxiety and a weird finger-wagging moralism.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Clay Enos/Warner Bros</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Quinn\u2019s not alone either.

In <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/apr/21/avengers-age-of-ultron-review-film-joss-whedon-exhilarating\">Avengers: Age of Ultron</a>, Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), awesome super-spy, admits that she sees herself as a monster because she can\u2019t have children, and longs for domestic bliss. In the recent <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/jul/26/batman-sexism-the-killing-joke-remake-source-material\">The Killing Joke cartoon</a>, Batgirl, like Harley, insists on turning a professional relationship into a romantic one. She talks about her crime-fighting partnership with Batman as a romance when her friend asks her if she\u2019s dating anyone, and then, when she does have sex with him, she gives into emotional outbursts and violence, beating a villain almost to death \u2013 just as Harley would. </p> <p>Even in the consciously feminist female-led <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/ghostbusters--2016-\">Ghostbusters</a><em> </em>remake, the heroic women scientists and engineers don\u2019t have any romantic interests. This can be seen as an affirmation of sisterhood and female independence; kick-ass professional women don\u2019t need a man. But it also fits into the longstanding trope which pits women\u2019s professional lives against their love lives. \u201cWe both know that the mind of a woman in love is operating on the lowest level of the intellect,\u201d Constance\u2019s mentor smugly tells her. </p> <p>Men in pop culture generally aren\u2019t confronted with this kind of disconnect between their heart and their professional accomplishments. In <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/oct/21/spectre-review-james-bond-is-back-stylish-camp-and-sexily-pro-snowden\">Spectre</a>, Bond\u2019s romantic connection with the leading lady helps him complete his mission. In <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/man-of-steel-2\">Batman v Superman</a>, Lois Lane is an asset to Superman, not a distraction. Batman may punch Superman in the face, but he never glances meaningfully at Lois while declaiming: \u201cWe both know that the mind of a Superman in love is operating on the lowest level of the intellect.\u201d </p> <p>For that matter, the Joker doesn\u2019t cease to be a malevolent master of crime when he falls for Harley Quinn. The Joker pursues chaos and crime before finding Harley, and he makes sure that Harley joins him in those pursuits. Love makes Harley Quinn more like the Joker \u2013 and love makes the Joker more like the Joker. Only one of them needs to trade their self for love, and it\u2019s not the guy.</p> <p>In both Spellbound and Suicide Squad, \u201cwoman psychiatrist\u201d is presented as an oxymoron \u2013 or as madness. Women\u2019s place is in the home and in love; a woman dispassionately studying the brain must, therefore, have something wrong with her own brain and her own life. Homicidal madmen are one thing, but still, after 70 years, what really disturbs Hollywood scriptwriters is a woman with an advanced degree.</p>",
  "<p>For two years,<strong> </strong>I took injectable estrogen once every two weeks. </p> <p>I\u2019d carefully expose the needle and draw out the thick liquid, filling the syringe, and tap out the bubbles. Then I\u2019d enlist a friend to help inject it. It symbolized to me that gender transition is a combination of strength from within and community support. </p> <p>I will never forget my sister\u2019s try. She pushed too fast, separating the barrel from the needle, leaving half in my arm and the estrogen across my face. Otherwise, she\u2019s a terrific registered nurse.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/aug/09/injectable-estrogen-shortage-transgender-healthcare\">Shortage of estrogen drugs in US worries trans women: 'It's my peace of mind'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But last year, my pharmacy was suddenly unable to fill my prescription, which I depend on the same way those with diabetes, thyroid failure, HIV or countless other now-treatable conditions depend on theirs. It was on backorder, I was told, with no further explanation. This was over a year before Out magazine <a href=\"http://www.out.com/out-exclusives/2016/8/04/exclusive-theres-injectable-estrogen-shortage-thats-leaving-trans-women\">reported on the national shortage</a> last week. </p> <p>My pharmacy offered to request a replacement prescription from my doctor for a double dose at a lower concentration. This would require weekly shots, each of which left my arm or thigh sore for a few days, so I opted instead for daily pills which dissolve under my tongue.<br></p> <p>Switching to pills was an easier decision for me than for others. Pills must be taken daily, which is easy to forget. Their contents reach the bloodstream indirectly, instead passing medicine through the liver, which can be dangerous over time. Many trans women, myself included, feel that shots and the cyclic nature of the estrogen levels rising and falling across bi-weekly doses feels more natural, and more effective, than the continuous levels from daily pills.<br></p> <p>In whatever form we take them, hormones are molecules that signal cells in the body to do specific things, like lines of software code. The more often they appear, the more that command is accessed. Hormones like testosterone and estrogen control our sex characteristics, especially in the womb and through puberty.<br></p> <p>Amazingly, everyone\u2019s body has an ability to respond to both \u201cmale\u201d and \u201cfemale\u201d instructions, depending on which hormones are present. Nobody fully understands what makes a person identify as a different gender than their body has developed. But for those needing them, prescription hormones change the software our bodies run on. We are \u201chacking\u201d our bodies to match how we feel on the inside.</p> <p>This helps trans people to not only survive, but thrive. But it only works if the drugs are reliably available and affordable.</p> <p>My pharmacists were likely aware last year that high-dose estrogen injections would be scarce for the 18 months and counting. Reportedly, Par Pharmaceuticals, its manufacturer, must wait on new Food and Drug Administration approvals following changes in material suppliers. The reasoning feels almost irrelevant to those whose lives are affected.</p> <p>Making myself more feminine stops me from feeling disgusted by my body. I always was a woman, simply one with a deficiency of a certain signalling hormone, which my body so comfortably responds to now. It is about being seen as my truest self, and recognizing the effort it has taken to realize her.</p> <p>Missing hormones, on the other hand, while not directly lethal, will lead to anxiety, depression and the return of certain male features<strong> </strong>such as spontaneous erections, which trans women find uncomfortable and terrifying. But taking female hormones treats the dysphoria above all, as if tweaking my brain\u2019s coding alongside feminizing my body. It lifts many of us from the clutches of self-harm or darker thoughts.</p> <p>Trans people have teetered long enough on the fringes of medicine that this shortage feels like yet another stumbling block against getting acceptable care. The FDA continually reveals itself to be a body of bias over basis, as it <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/dec/22/restrictions-against-blood-donation-undermine-lgbt-equality\">doubled down</a> on enforcing obsolete restrictions upon gay male blood donations and <a href=\"http://www.advocate.com/health/2015/02/02/fda-everyone-transgender-gay-man\">in effect considers</a> trans women to likewise be men who have sex with men.<br></p> <p>This regulatory issue pertains to US distribution only, so some girls may seek estrogen through other channels or countries. There are reputable US compounding pharmacies that fill prescriptions by mail, but going overseas or to black markets makes it harder to be sure what you are buying. Plus, you have to pay out of pocket.</p> <p>For decades, it was difficult to find doctors willing to discuss trans medicine, let alone insurance willing to cover it. It is endlessly frustrating to receive a drug I will take forever by monthly dole, remembering to place refill orders quarterly, and sorting out the inevitable glitches therein, such as doctors who accidentally write \u201cdispense 30\u201d when they mean 30 days\u2019 worth.</p> <p>The FDA could do well to fast-track this bureaucratic debacle and help us trans women get on with our wonderful lives. Until then, we\u2019re stuck in an uncomfortable holding pattern, never certain if we\u2019ll be able to feel like ourselves, a state most people have the luxury of taking for granted.</p> <ul> <li><em>Comments on this article are premoderated</em></li> </ul>",
  "<p>And so ends the great populist uprising of our time, fizzling out pathetically in the mud and the bigotry stirred up by a third-rate would-be caudillo named Donald J Trump. So closes an era of populist outrage that began back in 2008, when the Davos dream of a world run by benevolent bankers first started to crack. The unrest has taken many forms in these eight years \u2013 from idealistic to cynical, from Occupy Wall Street to the Tea Party \u2013 but they all failed to change much of anything.<br></p> <p>And now the last, ugliest, most fraudulent manifestation is failing so spectacularly that it may discredit populism itself for years to come.</p> <p>Two weeks ago, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jul/28/hillary-clinton-donald-trump-voters-republicans-democrats\">I wrote</a> in this space about how the Trump phenomenon had reconfigured the conventional geometry of the two-party system. Trump was riding high in the polls at that moment, and there was reason to believe that his criticism of trade deals \u2013 one of several Trumpian causes long associated with the populist left \u2013 might play havoc with the Democrats\u2019 happy centrist plans.</p> <p>Now let us ponder the opposite scenario. In the intervening two weeks, Trump has destroyed himself more efficiently than any opposition campaign could ever have done. First, he heaped mounds of insults on the family of a US soldier killed in Iraq, then <a href=\"http://www.wsj.com/articles/the-week-they-decided-he-was-crazy-1470354031\">prominent journalists</a> raised doubts about his <a href=\"http://crooksandliars.com/2016/08/msnbcs-joe-scarborough-trump-acting\">mental state</a>, and then (as if to confirm his doubters) he <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/09/trump-gun-owners-clinton-judges-second-amendment\">dropped a strong hint</a> that gun enthusiasts might take action against Hillary Clinton should she appoint supreme court justices not to his liking. </p> <p>His chances, <a href=\"http://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2016-election-forecast/?ex_cid=rrpromo#now\">as measured in the polls</a>, went almost overnight from fairly decent to utter crap. For much of this year, populism had the gilded class really worried. There was Bernie Sanders and the unthinkable threat of a socialist president. There was the terrifying Brexit vote. Just a short while ago the American national newspapers were running <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/in-trump-some-obama-backers-see-a-new-champion-of-hope-and-change/2016/08/05/6ba433b8-5986-11e6-831d-0324760ca856_story.html\">page-one stories</a> telling readers it was time to take seriously Trump\u2019s followers, if not Trump himself. And on <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/03/opinion/how-clinton-could-knock-trump-out.html?_r=0\">3 August</a>, New York Times columnist Thomas Friedman actually typed the following: \u201cIt scares me that people are so fed up with elites, so hate and mistrust [Hillary] Clinton and are so worried about the future \u2013 jobs, globalization and terrorism\u201d that they might actually vote for Trump.</p> <p>Yes, it scared Friedman that the American people didn\u2019t like their masters any longer. As it has no doubt scared many of his rich friends to learn over the past few years that the people formerly known as middle class are angry about losing their standard of living to the same forces that are making those rich people ever more comfortable.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/jul/06/donald-trump-says-hillary-clinton-lied-to-cover-up-corrupt-financial-dealings-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/4nqzp\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2598100\"            data-video-name=\"Donald Trump says Hillary Clinton lied to cover up \u2018corrupt financial dealings\u2019 \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"Reuters\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-577c7761e4b0dc6aac1d848c\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/07/06/160706Trump_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/07/06/160706Trump.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/07/06/160706Trump_synd_768k_vp8.webm\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2016/07/06/160706Trump_small.3gp\"/><source src=\"http://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=11660462&amp;format=video/3gp&amp;minwidth=700\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/jul/06/donald-trump-says-hillary-clinton-lied-to-cover-up-corrupt-financial-dealings-video\">Donald Trump says Hillary Clinton lied to cover up \u2018corrupt financial dealings\u2019</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>Well, Friedman need be frightened no longer. Today it looks as though his elites are taking matters well in hand. \u201cJobs\u201d don\u2019t really matter now in this election, nor does the debacle of \u201cglobalization\u201d, nor does anything else, really. Thanks to this imbecile Trump, all such issues have been momentarily swept off the table while Americans come together around Clinton, the wife of the man who envisaged the Davos dream in the first place.</p> <p>As leading Republicans desert the sinking ship of Trump\u2019s GOP, America\u2019s two-party system itself has temporarily become a one-party system. And within that one party, the political process bears a striking resemblance to dynastic succession. Party office-holders selected Clinton as their candidate long ago, apparently determined to elevate her despite every possible objection, every potential legal problem. The Democratic National Committee <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2016/07/22/politics/dnc-wikileaks-emails/\">helped out, too</a>, as WikiLeaks tells us. <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/07/2016-barack-obama-hillary-clinton-democratic-establishment-campaign-primary-joe-biden-elizabeth-warren-214023#ixzz4Gfn7HFZ1\">So did President Barack Obama</a>, that former paladin for openness, who in the past several years did nearly everything in his power to suppress challenges to Clinton and thus ensure she would continue his legacy of tepid, bank-friendly neoliberalism.</p> <p>My leftist friends persuaded themselves that this stuff didn\u2019t really matter, that Clinton\u2019s many concessions to Sanders\u2019 supporters were permanent concessions. But with the convention over and the struggle with Sanders behind her, headlines show Clinton triangulating to the right, scooping up the dollars and the endorsement, and the elites shaken loose in the great Republican wreck.</p> <p>She is reaching out to the foreign policy <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/clintons-republican-outreach-a-step-too-far-for-already-suspicious-liberals/2016/08/10/df58b3b2-5f0b-11e6-8e45-477372e89d78_story.html\">establishment</a> and the neocons. She is reaching out to <a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/08/hillary-clinton-republicans/495254/\">Republican </a>office-holders. She is reaching out to <a href=\"http://www.recode.net/2016/6/28/12050588/hillary-clinton-tech-policy-love-letter-silicon-valley\">Silicon Valley</a>. And, of course, she is reaching out to <a href=\"http://fortune.com/2016/07/25/clinton-wall-street-bloomberg/\">Wall Street</a>. In her big <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/11/hillary-clinton-infrastructure-economy-jobs-trade-deals\">speech in Michigan</a> on Thursday she cast herself as the candidate who could bring bickering groups together and win policy victories through really comprehensive convenings.</p> <p>Things will change between now and November, of course. But what seems most plausible from the current standpoint is a landslide for Clinton, and with it the triumph of complacent neoliberal orthodoxy. She will have won her great victory, not as a champion of working people\u2019s concerns, but as the greatest moderate of them all, as the leader of a stately campaign of sanity and national unity. The populist challenge of the past eight years, whether led by Trump or by Sanders, will have been beaten back resoundingly. Centrism will reign triumphant over the Democratic party for years to come. This will be her great accomplishment. The bells will ring all over Washington DC.</p> <p>In this ironic and roundabout way, Trump may prove to be a disaster for the reform politics he has never really believed in. Indeed, it would be difficult to find a leader who could discredit populism more thoroughly than this compassion-free billionaire. For Friedman\u2019s beloved \u201celites\u201d, I predict that Trump will come to serve an important symbolic purpose. Trump loves to boast that he is immune to the scourge of money in politics, that he\u2019s nobody\u2019s puppet, and from his coming ruin and disgrace we will no doubt be told to draw many lessons about how money in politics actually helps prevent the rise of people like Trump and makes the system more stable. </p> <p>For decades, the Davos set have told us that doubt about \u201cglobalization\u201d was a species of racism, and soon Trump, as a landslide loser, will confirm this for them in overwhelming terms.</p> <p>My friends and I like to wonder about who will be the \u201cnext Bernie Sanders\u201d, but what I am suggesting here is that whoever emerges to lead the populist left will simply be depicted as the next Trump. The billionaire\u2019s scowling country-club face will become the image of populist reform, whether genuine populists had anything to do with him or not. This is the real potential disaster of 2016: That legitimate economic discontent is going to be dismissed as bigotry and xenophobia for years to come.</p>",
  "<p>A glance at the headlines would have you believe Fox News is on the ropes. Its former chairman, CEO and spiritual leader, Roger Ailes, has not only been ousted but buried under a pile of sexual abuse allegations.

Meanwhile, its audience is dying off: the <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/31/business/media/fox-news-holds-its-lead-in-a-year-of-growth-for-cable-news.html\">median Fox viewer</a> is 67 yearsold, according to Nielsen.<br></p> <p>All these things are true, and tend to fuel <a href=\"http://variety.com/2016/biz/news/roger-ailes-rupert-murdoch-fox-news-gretchen-carlson-1201816630/\">speculation</a> that the network will have to clean house, name a successor, and move away from fire and brimstone toward a fresher, gentler Fox News.<br></p> <p>That possibility is shrinking faster than Donald Trump\u2019s poll numbers. On Friday, with a certain Spartan vibe, Rupert Murdoch created a new Fox News co-presidency shared by longtime Ailes lieutenant Bill Shine, who may yet be implicated in enabling Fox\u2019s epidemic of sexual abuse, and local TV chief Jack Abernethy. It was a symbolic double-promotion, but both are under daddy\u2019s supervision.<br></p> <p>The true successor to Ailes \u2013 who is still fighting the abuse allegations and vehemently denies wrongdoing \u2013 will be the next CEO and chairman. Candidates range from insiders such as executive editor John Moody and head of news Jay Wallace to <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/5fc2d4e4-4e98-11e6-8172-e39ecd3b86fc.html\">superstar outsiders</a> such as CBS president David Rhodes. But whoever shows up won\u2019t have anything close to the control of \u201cthe Chairman\u201d, whose influence at Fox operates on a genetic level.<br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/aug/08/roger-ailes-sexual-harassment-accusations-fox-tv-producer\">Roger Ailes accused in new harassment claim of proposing 'sexual alliance'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Ailes has been banished, but the creature he electrified to life two decades ago now roams free on its own.<br></p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t expect them to make a big change in their coverage,\u201d said Jane Hall, former Fox contributor and professor of media studies at American University. \u201cIt\u2019s a highly successful formula.\u201d<br></p> <p>Fox is a money monster, pumping out over $1bn in <a href=\"http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/sns-wp-blm-fox-9648c86a-5a4c-11e6-8b48-0cb344221131-20160804-story.html\">profits</a> a year. It rakes in about 20% of 21st Century Fox\u2019s earnings, the most profitable unit in the empire. Perhaps that\u2019s why the Murdoch brothers, Lachlan and James, heirs to News Corp patriarch Rupert and no fans of Ailes, told investors last week that they had no intention of tinkering with the \u201cunique and important voice\u201d of their moneymaker.<br></p> <p>Despite all the drama, former employees say that Fox is a money machine that can run the way it always has \u2013 and make the profits it always has \u2013 in a post-Ailes era.<br></p> <p>\u201cThe network can coast for years just on the institutional memory,\u201d said Joe Muto, who worked as a producer for Fox star Bill O\u2019Reilly for eight years before eventually going out in a blaze of glory after dishing the dirt on his employer to Gawker.<br></p> <p>\u201cAiles wanted to be successful, powerful and, yes, wanted to push his ideology,\u201d Muto said. \u201cMurdoch, I think, is less ideological, but he will default to whatever makes him money. And Fox has been a piggy bank. You look at their balance sheet and Fox underwrites other losses.\u201d<br></p> <p>The idea that a new CEO could steer Fox into something closer to CNN, or the smaller, friendlier conservative outlet Newsmax, presupposes that the profit motive is not driving one of the biggest media conglomerates on the planet. Not only does it continue to dominate ratings, it\u2019s such an essential part of America\u2019s media diet that most of its money comes from \u201ccarriage\u201d fees paid by the cable companies.<br></p> <p>And then there\u2019s the very good chance that this fall, voters will gift Fox another Clinton in the White House. Not only would it keep the network in the simple, righteous role of loyal opposition to liberal tyranny, it would also be a great return to the climate of Clinton-bashing that put Fox on the map back in the 90s.<br></p> <p>\u201cI think a Hillary presidency would guarantee the network maintains its rightwing bent for a few more years, even with the Murdoch brothers in control,\u201d said one ex-producer. Muto had a colorful metaphor at the ready: \u201cI would compare it to Batman and the Joker. Batman is a much more interesting character when he has the Joker as a foil.

For one thing, Fox generally does better under a Democratic reign. It\u2019s true that the network became No 1 under Bush\u2019s first term, but that was no doubt fuelled by the nonstop drama of 9/11, the invasion of Afghanistan, a climate of paranoia, and the culmination of the Iraq war \u2013 which, of course, Fox helped sell skillfully. \u201cI don\u2019t know how it would have played out without 9/11 and the Iraq war,\u201d Hall said.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>But eventually, Bush proved to be thin gruel, ratings-wise. \u201cI think Bush winning in \u201904 was a triumph for the network, but it went downhill quickly from there,\u201d Muto said. \u201cThe war started going badly. Hurricane Katrina happened. There was this sense that the network was having trouble carrying water for Bush any more. There was an overall sense of doom at Fox between Katrina and when the 2008 primaries began heating up.\u201d<br></p> <p>The ratings tell that story: from 2006 to 2007, Fox dropped to 1.4 million average viewers, down from 1.7 million a year before, according to Nielsen. By the end of 2008, they had shot up to 2 million.<br></p> <p>\u201cIt felt like the network was licking its chops for Hillary in 2008,\u201d said Muto. \u201c\u2018Our old nemesis is back.\u2019 Then when Obama showed up, it was even better.\u201d By 2009, the numbers were up to almost 2.2 million. Ratings have dipped in the latter half of Obama\u2019s second term, but a Clinton regime could be just the thing to reignite the base.<br></p> <p>\u201cThey can continue to attack the flaws of Bill Clinton through her,\u201d said Hall. \u201cShe\u2019s also, obviously, a woman.

But when you have him attacking the parents of war heroes, Fox is not gonna defend that for that long.\u201d<br></p> <p>Politics aside, Fox has a more concrete problem. The generational scare is real: the 25-54 demographic is only 17% of its audience and younger conservatives are generally <a href=\"http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/03/01/5-facts-about-abortion/\">far less interested</a> in enlisting to fight against the \u201cwar on Christmas\u201d.

If they want to attract a younger audience and eyeballs on digital, they need to recruit some new talent who knows how to do that.\u201d<br></p> <p>An ex-producer agrees: \u201cOne of the more puzzling things about Fox News is that they actually do have some legitimately talented field reporters \u2013 people who could conceivably get a scoop, break it on Twitter, and post an article that goes viral.

  "<p>The Peugeot 2008 is like a sleek-looking person dressed in a cashmere polo neck. A smidge unusual, with a trace of charisma; you don\u2019t know whether you want to hug it or smell it.</p> <p>It has a very open view, thanks to the wide windscreen and the determined addition of windows where you didn\u2019t expect them (little triangular ones in front of the wing mirror, a panoramic sunroof). I inferred a pure, unadulterated pride in the French countryside. It turned out the visibility was poor \u2013 too many struts between panes of glass \u2013 and the panoramic roof was a booby trap. (It looked as though it should open, but was, in fact, only decorative; in the course of pushing every button to find that out, I accidentally called Peugeot\u2019s roadside emergency unit.

The gearshift is imprecise, and the steering is neurotic in its overreaction. A motorcyclist told me off for floating all over the road. I tried to engage her in my predicament, explain how driving a new car is one thing, but driving a car that isn\u2019t like all the other cars, something else entirely; but she was off.

  "<p>Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s leadership campaign suffered a setback on Thursday after an unexpected Court of Appeal victory for the party\u2019s ruling body that will bar thousands of the leader\u2019s supporters from voting.</p> <p>Angry recriminations from Corbyn\u2019s team followed the court\u2019s decision, which will mean about 130,000 new members who joined less than six months ago will not be able to vote in the forthcoming poll between Corbyn and Owen Smith for the Labour leadership.</p> <p>Corbyn\u2019s campaign team openly attacked both the court of appeal judges and the party\u2019s HQ for fighting the appeal, castigating the decision as wrong \u201cboth legally and democratically.\u201d Shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, said lawyers had used \u201ca grubby little device\u201d to win the appeal. </p> <p>But Paddy Lillis, chair of the Labour NEC, insisted the party had a right to defend its processes.<br></p> <p>The ruling comes at the end of a stormy week for the party, with relations collapsing between Corbyn and his deputy Tom Watson after a public spat over <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/aug/09/tom-watson-interview-jeremy-corbyn-labour-rifts-hug-shout\">the latter\u2019s claims in the Guardian</a> that the party was at risk of \u201cTrotskyist entryists\u201d. That was dismissed by Corbyn and then repeated by Watson <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/aug/10/tom-watson-sends-corbyn-proof-of-trotskyist-labour-infiltration\">who produced a document</a> of far-left activists now involved in the party. The two leadership rivals, Corbyn and Smith, also clashed at a bitter hustings in Gateshead on Thursday, with Smith saying he would refuse to serve in a future shadow cabinet under Corbyn should his rival win the election.</p> <p>On Friday there had been expectations the appeal by the NEC would most likely be rejected by the court</p> <p>The NEC had originally said members who had joined after 12 January could not vote in the election, which the high court on Monday had said was a breach of contract law in a case brought by five new members, Christine Evangelou, Edward Leir, Hannah Fordham, Chris Granger and \u201cFM\u201d, a teenage member.</p> <p>But in the court of appeal on Friday Lord Justice Beatson, sitting with Lady Justice Macur and Lord Justice Sales, overturned the decision and ruled that the NEC \u201chas the power to set the criteria for members to be eligible to vote in the leadership election in the way that it did\u201d.</p> <p>Corbyn\u2019s spokesman said lawyers had invoked \u201can obscure clause\u201d in the Labour party rulebook, which could give the NEC powers to override election rules.</p> <p>\u201cIn other words, this is a \u2018make it up as you go along\u2019 rule,\u201d the campaign said. \u201cWe do not think that making it up as you go along is a reasonable way to conduct democracy in our party.\u201d </p> <p>McDonnell told the BBC: \u201cI just find it shaming for a democratic party like ours, with a tradition of over a century of campaigning for democracy throughout our society ... We are now undermining the democracy of our own party.\u201d</p> <p>Though both Corbyn and Smith\u2019s teams acknowledge the bulk of the new members now excluded are likely to be supporters of Corbyn, Smith\u2019s camp were cautious not to overplay the significance of the result as being in their favour.<br></p> <p>The campaign believes new members would have signed up convinced either way of who they would vote for and want to focus their efforts on longer-standing members and so-called \u201csoft Corbynites\u201d who joined prior to the 2015 election. </p> <p>Around 50,000 new members excluded by the ruling are understood to have paid the additional \u00a325 registered supporters fee to vote in the leadership election in any event. </p> <p>The ruling will come as a relief for the Labour party\u2019s general secretary Iain McNicol, who is widely considered to have risked his position in order to bring the appeal. \u201cHe has put his career on the line,\u201d one senior Labour source said. </p> <p>With many members angry at the expense of the appeal, though \u00a330,000 will be recovered in costs, one Labour source speculated were Corbyn to win the leadership election, some members of a divided NEC could move for a vote of no confidence in McNicol.</p> <p>Corbyn\u2019s campaign team said: \u201cSerious questions must be raised over why and how the NEC procedures committee brought this appeal. In doing so, it effectively risked new members\u2019 money on an attempt to disenfranchise them. If we are to build a big, inclusive party to take on the Tories, we need to secure democracy in our party.\u201d</p> <p>Corbyn and others angry at the court of appeal judgment are unlikely to make concrete moves before the leadership election. Ballot papers will be sent out in the post and by email from next Monday, to be returned by 21 September, with the result announced at a special conference in Liverpool on 24 September. </p> <p>The election has now involved six days in court \u2013 and just two leadership hustings between Corbyn and Smith \u2013 but permission to appeal to the supreme court was denied on Friday. An application could still be made directly by the appellants. Corbyn and Smith will next face off at a hustings in Nottingham next Wednesday.</p> <p>Paddy Lillis, chair of the Labour NEC, said: \u201cIt was right that the party appealed the judgment, just as we would have appealed if the court in the previous case did not uphold the NEC decision that the incumbent leader of the Labour party did not require nominations. <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>\u201cIt is crucial to the Labour party that our governing body has the authority to debate, decide and implement the procedures, timetable and voting eligibility for our internal elections and selections.\u201d</p> <p>Edward Leir, one of the five new members who sued the party, said: \u201cThis case was always about fairness and inclusion, which won in the high court on Monday with a clear and firm judgment.</p> <p>\u201cIt is a hugely disappointing result for me and probably for the 130,000 members similarly excluded. I am very grateful for everyone, including the 2,000 donors who have supported our fight over this matter so far.\u201d</p> <p>The court accepted that, in ordinary language, a \u201cfreeze date\u201d could be retrospective. \u201cA \u2018freeze date\u2019 for an election is simply the date by which a particular state of affairs must exist in order for a person to be eligible to vote. It necessarily will mean that some members have voting rights while others will not. </p> <p>\u201cWe do not consider that there is anything in the ordinary meaning of the term which suggests that it can only be prospective.\u201d</p>",

That doesn\u2019t seem to be the case at the moment.\u201d</p> <p>During the rally in Altoona, Trump also claimed that the National Security Agency has Clinton\u2019s missing emails and called on the agency to release them publicly. He was joined in Pennsylvania on Friday by Republican national committee chairman <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMjhkG60ogk\">Reince Priebus</a> amid speculation of friction between the camps.</p> <p>Meanwhile Clinton\u2019s husband Bill was campaigning in Las Vegas, Nevada. Addressing a forum of Asian American voters, the former president framed the election as a choice not simply of policy but of America\u2019s identity as a nation of immigrants. </p> <p>Looking around the room at the thousands who packed an auditorium at the Caesars Palace casino hotel, just down the Las Vegas strip from Trump\u2019s eponymous tower, Clinton said \u201cthe metaphor of this election may be walls or bridges.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAre we stronger together or stronger apart?\u201d he asked the crowd, comprising mostly of voters representing the nation\u2019s fastest-growing racial group. \u201cYou remind people that e pluribus unum -- out of many, one -- is not just a slogan, it\u2019s a way of life.</p> <p>\u201cYou remind people that the eternal effort of making our union more perfect means expanding our definition of us and shrinking our definition of them, not the other way around.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>\u201cI\u2019m really sorry, but we have done all we can.\u201d I slowly pick my hands up to tell the 19-year-old eastern European girl in front of me that she is going to have to wipe her eyes and walk back out of the council offices, homeless, hungry and at risk. </p> <p>The council officer to my left is wearing the same steely, but resigned look that I have seen on the face of every council officer I meet. I tell the deaf client, in sign language, that the appointment is over and watch her face fall. No matter how many times I do this \u2013 and it has been hundreds \u2013 it still hurts knowing that I am the person to tell them there is no hope left.</p> <p>When it is over, I smile at the deaf person, who thanks me profusely for doing my job. She tells me that even though the council couldn\u2019t help her get a flat, at least they provided an interpreter for the meeting \u2013 that wouldn\u2019t have happened in her own country. </p> <p>Despite the heavy heart I carry after these assignments, I love my job. I moved into the role quite unexpectedly after meeting a group of deaf children at an event and, after learning the basics, found that I had a real aptitude for sign language. Ten years later, I was able to qualify and started working on a freelance basis. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/public-leaders-network/2013/may/10/public-services-deaf-people-loophole\">Scared, abandoned and ignored: public services for deaf people</a> </p> </aside>  <p>I now work across all public services \u2013 the NHS, courts, police stations, prison services, counselling, mental health, immigration, mediation and education. As a freelance, I manage my own diary. My next booking, made via an agency, is an antenatal appointment. That\u2019s all the information I have. I don\u2019t know if the client is newly pregnant, if they are having complications or if this is just a routine appointment. </p> <p> But when I turn up another interpreter is waiting for the same client. We have been double-booked. After some pleasantries, I realise that the other interpreter is not a professional interpreter at all and has only a basic language certificate in BSL, probably enough to talk about what you are having for dinner and where you are going on holiday, but less able to describe the intricate workings of someone\u2019s uterus. I send the other interpreter home and offer to sort it out with the agency later.</p> <p>This is not uncommon. Most of our work is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2012/mar/02/interpreters-courts-protest-privatised-contract\">outsourced by the government </a>to large interpreting agencies, which have undercut each other and then outsourced the work to specialists. After the agencies take their share, there isn\u2019t much money left and we are often asked to take a pay cut \u2013 despite the government paying hand over fist for translation services. </p> <p>Many larger agencies lack understanding about what we do, with BSL too often simply added onto the list of languages available. Sometimes the agencies bypass professional interpreters completely and opt for untrained signers who come cheap. This is particularly apparent with legal and court interpreting. Five years ago, legal work was taken on by the best interpreters. Now, they are all agency staff and often inexperienced. The results are clear, with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2016/may/04/thousands-of-court-cases-adjourned-due-to-failures-in-interpreting-services\">thousands of court cases being adjourned </a>due to failures in interpreting services. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2012/mar/02/interpreters-courts-protest-privatised-contract\">Interpreters stay away from courts in protest at privatised contract</a> </p> </aside>  <p> </p> <p>Back at my appointment, when my heavily pregnant client arrives we sit together in the waiting room.

We go in and I stand near the radiographer, who asks if my client wants to find out if it is a boy or girl. My client suggests the radiographer can tell me, and I write it down on a piece of paper so she can take it home and they can decide later. As we walk out, I ask my client whether she has a preference. She laughs and says she is ecstatic; she knows they are having a girl. Turns out, she is pretty good at lip-reading.</p> <p> BSL makes up a tiny percentage of all interpreting services, but our funding comes from the same pot.

  "<h2><strong>What are government bonds?</strong></h2> <p>Think of them as a type of loan from investors to a government. They are issued by governments around the world to raise money to cover the shortfall they have between what they want to spend and what they have coming in from things such as taxes each year. Bonds can be structured in a number of ways, but at the simplest the government promises to pay the buyer small cash payments, called coupons and set at a fixed rate, usually twice a year until the bond matures, when the buyer also gets back the money loaned to the government.</p> <p>Bonds are issued by the government\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.dmo.gov.uk/\">debt management office</a> (DMO) and can have a lifetime as short as three years or last for decades. The longest-dated bond issued by the UK will be paid back on 22 July 2068. These bonds are particularly popular with pension funds. The UK government\u2019s bonds are called gilts \u2013 a gilt-edged security on which the government has never missed a payment.</p> <h2><strong>How do you buy and sell them?</strong></h2> <p>Bonds can be bought by anyone <a href=\"http://www.dmo.gov.uk/index.aspx?page=Gilts/Gilt_Faq#Individuals\">on the approved-buyers list</a>. These days they are rarely bought by individuals, more often by big City investors such as pension funds and banks. Otherwise, once they are issued, they are traded on the London Stock Exchange. Once upon a time they were sold at post offices.</p> <h2><strong>Why are gilts in the news?</strong></h2> <p>As part of its plan to counter any economic downturn caused by the vote to leave the EU, the Bank of England has expanded the quantitative easing (QE) programme it first introduced in March 2009. QE has been likened to electronic money printing. The Bank is independent of the government and its main aim is to keep inflation under control. The Bank uses QE as part of this aim. The scheme works by the Bank creating new money electronically and using it to buy gilts back from banks and big City investment firms<strong>.</strong> The hope is the big financial firms then use that money to buy other assets such as shares or to lend to individuals and companies, so that more money flows around the economy. At the same time, the cost of borrowing falls.</p> <h2><strong>What happened this week?</strong></h2> <p>The Bank put QE back into action. On Monday, it bought back short-dated gilts, with a lifespan between three and seven years; on Tuesday, it bought back gilts with a maturity of 15 years or more; and on Wednesday, it bought gilts with timescale between the two. (It is a pattern that will be repeated weekly during the six-month period the Bank has allowed itself to buy \u00a360bn of government bonds.) It did not get off to a smooth start. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/09/banks-post-brexit-strategy-hits-snag-as-gilt-buyback-falls-short\">On Tuesday, the Bank was unable to buy as many bonds as hoped</a>, being left with a \u00a352m shortfall for the first time since QE was enacted.</p> <h2><strong>Why did the plan fail?</strong></h2> <p>Not enough gilts were offered to the Bank of England. There are a number of possible reasons for this: it is August, a traditionally quiet month in the City; big pension funds want to hold on to their long-dated gilts because they need them to match their promises to savers; also, many in the City were not expecting more QE from the Bank so soon after the referendum and were caught on the hop by the new bond-buying.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/10/why-the-banks-bond-buying-failure-may-not-be-just-a-blip\">Why Bank of England's bond-buying failure may not be just a blip | Larry Elliott</a> </p> </aside>  <h2><strong>Should savers be worried?</strong></h2> <p>It is unusual for individuals to buy and hold gilts. But if you wanted to buy any now, you would find them more expensive and the returns less attractive. The prices are already being forced up because of the expected demand from the Bank of England wanting to buy them in the coming six months. This price rise is driving down the yield \u2013 the way the return is measured for anyone buying the bond at that price and holding it to maturity. In some cases <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/10/uk-borrowing-costs-record-lows-bank-post-brexit-plan-gilt-buybacks\">the yield has turned negative</a> \u2013 effectively, you are paying the government for the security of the future repayment. But anyone who has already bought bonds will not be affected \u2013 the half-yearly payments are pre-determined and the bond will still be paid back at maturity. Selling the bond now would ensure a capital gain \u2013 although the income stream would be lost.</p> <p>This adds to a broader problem for savers in an era of very low interest rates. The Bank also cut official interest rates this month to a record low of 0.25%, further eating into returns on people\u2019s deposits. But as the Bank\u2019s governor, Mark Carney, has implied, this may be the unavoidable price of keeping people in their jobs. Carney has also emphasised that the Treasury must play a role and economists say that could mean the end of austerity.</p> <p>There has also been an impact on new retirees. Pension companies have been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2016/jun/27/annuities-hit-rates-fall-brexit\">cutting the amount they will pay people who are newly retiring through annuities</a>. An annuity is a product available for retirees and offers an income for life, bought at retirement with all or part of a person\u2019s pension savings. The returns available reflect movements in interest rates, and, since the Brexit vote, the money markets have signalled lower long-term rates.</p> <h2><strong>Is the Bank going to struggle to buy enough gilts to meet its target?</strong></h2> <p>The easy answer is that it is too early to tell. The next big test comes on Tuesday, when the Bank goes back into the market to buy the longest-dated gilts. Even if it meets its goals, there is still a risk that future buybacks will stumble. The Bank may have to offer more money to get pension funds to part with some of their longer-dated bond holdings. It may also have to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/10/why-the-banks-bond-buying-failure-may-not-be-just-a-blip\">buy more shorter-dated bonds than currently planned</a>.</p>",

There\u2019s more citizen awareness about women\u2019s rights.\u201d</p> <p>The march is just the beginning, according to Romero, 68, who twice served as the minister for women under the government of Alejandro Toledo, whose term as Peruvian president ran from 2001 to 2006. On average, 10 women are murdered every month in Peru, said Romero, while ministry figures indicate a further 20 are victims of attempted femicide.</p> <p>\u201cIf you add to those 10 who lose their lives the 20 victims who are saved by the skin of their teeth, then we are practically talking about one [attack] per day,\u201d she said. \u201cOf those 10 who are killed around six are under the age of 20.\u201d</p> <p>Romero began her latest stint with a bang by criticising remarks made by Peru\u2019s most senior Catholic cleric, Cardinal Juan Luis Cipriani, the Archbishop of Lima. Speaking on his weekly radio programme, Cipriani made remarks that appeared to tacitly blame women and girls for provoking sexual attacks by dressing provocatively, as if in a \u201cshop window\u201d. </p> <p>The incoming minister publicly repudiated his remarks, saying his statement \u201cremoves all responsibility from the attacker\u201d.</p> <p>The archbishop apologised for his comments, which the church in Peru claimed had been taken out of context. But Romero said there was no room for misinterpretation.</p> <p>Women\u2019s rights groups praised her comments, which suggested a change in attitude from her previous terms in office, when she appeared to be \u201cstrongly influenced by sectors of the church\u201d, said Sus\u00e1na Chavez, director of <a href=\"http://promsex.org/\">Promsex</a>. </p> <p>The incident has boosted public debate over gender violence and sexist attitudes.

Pozo received a suspended sentence after a judge ruled that Contreras\u2019 injuries did not suggest any intent on his part to rape or murder her.</p> <p>In a second widely publicised case, photos of Lady Guill\u00e9n\u2019s bruised face dating back to 2012 were made public. However, the injuries she suffered at the hands of her ex-boyfriend, Ronny Garc\u00eda, were not enough to convince the judge that her life was in danger and Garc\u00eda was released after spending four years in prison.</p> <p>\u201cThese cases outraged people and ignited the movement,\u201d march organiser Sasa de la Cruz, said. \u201cBut they are just two examples which show women can\u2019t get justice.\u201d</p> <p>Earlier this week, Peru\u2019s human rights ombudsman, Eduardo Vega, said the state treated female survivors of physical or sexual violence with \u201cabsolute neglect\u201d.</p> <p>According to a <a href=\"http://www.defensoria.gob.pe/modules/Downloads/prensa/notas/2015/NP-268-15.pdf\">2015 study by Peru\u2019s ombudsman\u2019s office</a>, La Defensor\u00eda del Pueblo, in 81% of the studied cases no measures were taken to protect survivors of attempted femicide. As a result, 24% of those women who had sought help were murdered by the assailant they had reported to the authorities, the study concluded.</p> <p>Romero said the new government, which took office on 28 July, would train police to be more aware of the problem, ensure better provision of psychological support, open more women\u2019s shelters, and establish 245 emergency centres for women across the country.</p> <p>\u201cOur problem is not a lack of legislation, it is how we apply the law. Those in charge of justice need more sensitivity and a better understanding of the rights of the women,\u201d she added.</p> <p>Sexual violence is pervasive in Peru, taking many forms. Aside from the number of femicide cases, more than 23% of Peruvian women between 18 and 29 said they had been <a href=\"http://repositorio.pucp.edu.pe/index/bitstream/handle/123456789/15889/IOP_1212_01_R_1.pdf?sequence=1\">inappropriately touched on public transport</a>, according to a 2012 study by Lima\u2019s La Cat\u00f3lica University.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s fundamental to eradicate the macho and homophobic culture in this country,\u201d Romero said. \u201cHeading towards the bicentenary of our independence we still objectify women or naturalise violent conduct against her.</p> <p> \u201cThat belongs in a primitive era and has no place in the 21st century.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>It seems increasingly obvious to me that the only sensible way to look at the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/us-elections-2016\">US election</a> is through the prism of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/parks-and-recreation\">Parks And Recreation</a>. This American sitcom, which sadly came to the end of its six-year run last year, starred <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/amy-poehler\">Amy Poehler</a> as local government official Leslie Knope, and once you start seeing the parallels between the lovely fictional show and the horrible reality shitshow, it makes the latter feel more bearable. Obviously <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton\">Hillary Clinton</a> is Leslie, the blond politico, ambitious to her bones, who, whatever you think of her politics, is undeniably devoted to public service. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump\">Donald Trump</a> is an amalgam of Leslie\u2019s two worst male rivals: first, <a href=\"http://parksandrecreation.wikia.com/wiki/Bobby_Newport\">Bobby Newport</a>, the spoilt manboy as rich in money as he is poor in self-awareness; second, the proudly offensive Jeremy Jamm, with a fondness for saying things like, \u201cI love Chinese crap. Lucy Liu, Gangnam Style, sushi, etcetera etcetera.\u201d That could so easily be a Trump quote, given that he semi-apologised for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jun/16/donald-trump-mexico-presidential-speech-latino-hispanic\">referring to Mexicans as drug dealers and rapists</a> by tweeting <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/may/05/donald-trump-taco-bowl-i-love-hispanics-picture\">a photo of himself eating a taco bowl</a>, that I honestly had to check he hadn\u2019t said it in a CNN interview.</p> <p>It also seems increasingly obvious to me that the Clinton campaign needs to start screening Parks And Recreation at their events to solve what&#xa0;the media calls <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/shortcuts/2016/jun/08/hillary-clinton-wardrobe-matters-but-not-fashion-perspective\">Clinton\u2019s \u201clikability problem\u201d</a>. This doesn\u2019t refer to whether the electorate likes Clinton\u2019s policies, but how they imagine her to be as a person. For the past three decades the answer to that has been, by and large, no, they don\u2019t like her, with people hating her in the 1990s for being (if I remember correctly) an overly moralistic feminist who spat in housewives\u2019 cookie dough, and people hating her now because they think she\u2019s not moral enough, and that she will say anything to get elected. Clinton has generally seemed not to care about her personal unpopularity, which only made me like her more. But now she is running for the presidency against <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/dec/08/jk-rowling-on-donald-trump-voldemort-was-nowhere-as-bad\">a tiny-handed Voldemort</a> and so she is gritting her teeth and dealing with the issue. Last week she was asked, for the 10 billionth time, about her \u201clikability issues\u201d. Clinton replied that people like her once she\u2019s allowed to get on with the job, which is true, given her popularity when she was secretary of state and New York senator. It was a more dignified statement than the one she gave at the Democratic national convention last month: \u201cThrough all my years of public service, the \u2018service\u2019 part has always come easier to me than the \u2018public\u2019 part,\u201d she said, as though she were <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/may/14/fiction-charlesdickens\">Boo Radley</a>, who could help people only under the cover of night and then scurry into the shadows, so as not to offend anyone with her antisocial weirdness.</p> <p>Yes, male politicians have to pass the \u201cWould you have a beer with me?\u201d test. But given that Clinton has been a successful politician for 15 years, the issue of her likability is clearly about more than mere appeal. The real problem is that, while she needs to be ambitious to get as far as she has, ambitious women are seen, still, as inherently unlikable. She\u2019s supposed to pretend that she doesn\u2019t actually want to be commander in chief, in the way female celebrities are supposed to pretend they don\u2019t have to starve themselves to be thin. Such things are passively attained without any unfeminine effort. <a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2016/06/hillary-clinton-tracy-flick-and-the-reclaiming-of-ambition/486389/\">As Megan Garber recently wrote</a>, the female presidents now seen in US TV shows (Selina Meyer in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/veep\">Veep</a>, <a href=\"http://scandal.wikia.com/wiki/Sally_Langston\">Sally Langston in Scandal</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2005/sep/29/usnews.broadcasting\">Mackenzie Allen in Commander In Chief</a>) attain their powerful positions by fluke, not conscious ambition. In fact, when Veep\u2019s Selina Meyer had to campaign for the presidency in the last season, she became absurd and duly lost the election. Women who strive for political power are evil, summed up by the character of Tracy Flick in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/1999/sep/24/4\">the 1999 film Election</a>, still cited as the embodiment of monstrous female ambition, even though Tracy never does much wrong besides tear down some banners in frustration.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/commentisfree/2016/jul/23/theresa-may-margaret-thatcher-spot-the-difference-uk-politics-hadley-freeman\">Theresa May, Margaret Thatcher: spot the difference \u2013 and the sexism | Hadley Freeman</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The one glorious exception to this rule is Leslie Knope, a woman who fights like hell for political promotion, and is applauded for it. There is no contradiction between her political drive and her&#xa0;personal appeal. Through the plotlines involving Knope, Newport and Jamm, the show\u2019s point is that likability is nothing compared with capability. While sitcoms with cynical male characters are the cutting edge of current cool (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/louis-ck\">Louie</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/jul/21/bojack-horseman-season-three-netflix\">BoJack Horseman</a>), I\u2019m hoping that Parks And Rec will be the one that foresaw the zeitgeist. Because given the number of female politicians currently in high positions, its depiction of political women should not be an outlier, but the harbinger of a sea change.</p>",
  "<h2><strong>Roy Mallows, 53, shepherd, Cambridgeshire</strong></h2> <p>The county council land we farm was originally allotments. My grandfather took them over as they became vacant. He farmed pigs and poultry, and the arable land was used to produce feed. When he died in the 1960s, my father took over and farmed pigs and cattle; I joined him after I left school in 1979.</p> <p>By this time, the pigs were gone and cattle prices were on their way down, so we started a pedigree sheep flock. We now run about 550 ewes and followers, producing rams for breeding and high-quality butchers\u2019 lambs. The arable land has been put down to grass as it no longer pays.</p> <p>Sheep are seven days a week, 24 hours a day: there is always one sick, dead, stuck in a fence or out on the road. You have to be a midwife at lambing time, a hairdresser for shearing and a doctor all year round. Only the other night, I met a ewe and her lambs in the middle of the high street at 9.30pm \u2013 but for once it wasn\u2019t one of mine. With my son and some friends, we managed to trap them until the owner arrived with his daughter and sheepdog to herd them home.</p> <p>June was a nightmare this year because of the rain, every day. I couldn\u2019t get the shearing done: wet sheep won\u2019t shear. Wool\u2019s not worth a lot (about \u00a32 a fleece) which just about covers the cost of shearing. Lamb prices are approximately \u00a375-\u00a385 per lamb, depending on the weight and grade \u2013 which, when you take subsidies and costs into account, is no better than when I left school. All of the farmers running small or middle-sized farms I know voted to leave the EU because they believe, as I do, that prices cannot get any worse; if they do, it will be the nail in the coffin.</p> <p>A shepherd like me has a very uncertain future. My father is still working at nearly 80, but many younger tenants are being made to retire at 65, which does not bode well for me. My job is extremely physical; I cannot see myself doing the work I do now in 10 years\u2019 time. We are living on low wages and have only the state pension to come. People who work in offices think they have a stressful life, but we have a responsibility for the welfare of our animals, whatever the cost to our health and pockets.</p> <p>Of course there are things I love. I see things that other people miss. I was talking to a friend, and I saw a <a href=\"https://www.rspb.org.uk/discoverandenjoynature/discoverandlearn/birdguide/name/t/treecreeper/\">treecreeper bird</a> climbing one of his trees. I told him it was quite rare, and he hadn\u2019t any idea. I see butterflies that people say have died out. I might not know the proper name of a plant, but I can tell you exactly where it grows.</p> <p>I\u2019m never away from the river, and I see it change every day. The cricket club had a clear-up recently and they destroyed a kingfisher nest that had been there for 15 years \u2013 they thought it was just a hole in the bank. It was a shame: I used to like watching that kingfisher popping in and out. He\u2019ll be back, though.</p> <h2><strong>Kim Dixson, 28, footballer and community worker, south London</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2d6032afd5f0603a263dca9d147e0e64ba84b14d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2d6032afd5f0603a263dca9d147e0e64ba84b14d/0_0_4429_5906/750.jpg\" alt=\"Kim Dixson\" width=\"750\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Kim Dixson: \u2018You have to motivate other people to get outside.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ben Quinton for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I\u2019ve been at Charlton football club since I was eight. I\u2019m now captain of Charlton Athletic women, and I played for England under-23s. I trained as a PE teacher, and I\u2019ve always wanted to do something outdoors and sporty.</p> <p>I work with young people who might have been in trouble with the police. A big part of my job is running sessions on estates, in areas with high levels of antisocial behaviour, crime and deprivation. We go into the community, set up games and try to encourage the young residents to get involved. Sometimes it\u2019s a struggle, especially if the weather\u2019s not good. A lot of them are more used to being inside with their mates, playing on PlayStations. But when they do come out, it\u2019s great to see the effect it has; they\u2019re just happier.</p> <p>Part of my job is office-based: there\u2019s admin around getting referrals for some of the young people I work with and arranging one-to-one mentoring. But I\u2019m out every afternoon: some days I coach the Charlton girls\u2019 under-16 side, then I\u2019ll train with the ladies\u2019 team until 10pm. Occasionally I\u2019m in the office 9-5, and I\u2019m not the best at coping with that. I don\u2019t like sitting still for long.</p> <p>It is challenging when you\u2019ve got snow and hailstones: you can\u2019t clear snow off AstroTurf. You have to stay positive, though, and motivate other people to get outside, so I just put on a brave face. Rain, I\u2019m not that fussed about. As long as I\u2019ve got a coat with a hood, it doesn\u2019t bother me.</p> <h2><strong>Becky Austin, 29, assistant warden at the </strong><a href=\"http://www.rspb.org.uk/discoverandenjoynature/seenature/reserves/guide/l/lochlomond/index.aspx\"><strong>RSPB\u2019s Loch Lomond reserve</strong></a><strong>, Scotland</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6a863ca1c511e603592ebc521b856c770df5dca2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6a863ca1c511e603592ebc521b856c770df5dca2/0_1553_4912_5807/846.jpg\" alt=\"Becky Austin\" width=\"846\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Becky Austin: \u2018I pinch myself every day that someone\u2019s paying me to do this.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Martin Hunter for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I manage the residential volunteers who live on site at the lake. Throughout the winter we\u2019re cutting vegetation in the Aber bog, removing willow, sorting out the fences so the grazing cattle stay where they\u2019re supposed to. Putting up a fence by myself is one of the trickiest things I\u2019ve done. We also have a lot of survey work to do: getting up at dawn, watching the birds during breeding season, looking out for aggressive or nesting behaviour, or different species carrying food. You have to identify them all by song and call, which is something I\u2019ve had to learn.</p> <p>In the summer, you have to go out after sunset to do some of the observational work. Up here, sunset is after 11pm, and you can hear the <a href=\"http://www.wwww.rspb.org.uk/discoverandenjoynature/discoverandlearn/birdguide/name/s/spottedcrake/index.aspx\">spotted crake</a> calling to each other. You see <a href=\"http://www.m.www.rspb.org.uk/discoverandenjoynature/discoverandlearn/birdguide/name/t/tawnyowl/index.aspx\">tawny owls</a> and <a href=\"https://www.rspb.org.uk/discoverandenjoynature/discoverandlearn/birdguide/name/b/barnowl/index.aspx\">barn owls</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.rspb.org.uk/discoverandenjoynature/discoverandlearn/birdguide/name/o/osprey/\">ospreys</a> fishing on the loch. I saw my first <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/jun/21/first-encounter-pine-marten-country-diary\">pine marten</a> when I was out doing survey work.</p> <p>In the winter, it\u2019s a bit tougher. We have to be out at dawn to observe the geese, which roost on the flooded areas of the loch; we stand there until they all leave and try to count them. Sometimes all 10,000 birds go up at once so it\u2019s impossible \u2013 but the noise they make is just fantastic. I\u2019ve been pretty lucky with the winters so far, but it still gets very, very cold, and there are times when you\u2019re standing there, feet freezing, binoculars shaking; but good wellies, a flask and good company help a lot.</p> <p>We manage 237 hectares, and there\u2019s a whole range of habitats \u2013 wetland, woodland, ponds, the bog. My favourite spot is on one of the farm fields. There\u2019s an oak tree with a little nook that I fit into perfectly, and I can just sit there and read. It feels like home. I pinch myself every day that someone\u2019s paying me to do this.</p> <h2><strong>Angelo Daniel, 19, horticultural apprentice at the </strong><a href=\"http://heligan.com/\"><strong>Lost Gardens of Heligan</strong></a><strong>, Cornwall</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f6be30d5e85a5374ede64b181f36f046b445d7d0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f6be30d5e85a5374ede64b181f36f046b445d7d0/0_197_5326_3196/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Angelo Daniel\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Angelo Daniel: \u2018My favourite space is the jungle.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rebecca Rees for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I left sixth-form college last summer, and was looking for an agricultural apprenticeship. I\u2019d never been to Cornwall before I came for the interview (I was living 300 miles away in Shropshire) but I fell in love with the place. I spent the entire day wandering about with my mouth open.</p> <p>The gardens used to be privately owned. At the beginning of the first world war, most of the gardeners were enlisted and killed and the gardens fell into disrepair. In the early 1990s, they started a restoration project. It\u2019s around 250 acres and now owned by a trust.</p> <p>My favourite space is the jungle \u2013 a large valley with a natural microclimate. The original gardeners planted it up with a lot of tropical and Australasian plants, and when it was abandoned it grew up into this completely bizarre space. The valley means it\u2019s always around five degrees warmer, with very little wind, so it\u2019s like stepping through a window into the tropics.</p> <p>I live about a mile away, on the edge of a village called Mevagissey. In the winter I\u2019ll ride my motorcycle to work, but in the summer I might run. There\u2019s a path about 50 metres from my front door that runs right up through the woods to the estate. I\u2019m quite into parkour, and there are lots of great places to free run on my way in and out of work, which is pretty great.</p> <p>My day starts at 8am, and we usually begin with a tidy-up, trying to clear the fallen petals and leaves. It sounds a bit boring, but it\u2019s a lovely way to start the day; there\u2019s something special about spending a portion of the early morning either on your own or in a small group, just silently getting in touch with what the day is doing. In the last week or so, I\u2019ve been doing a lot of harvesting in the veg garden, digging up potatoes, picking broad beans, raking over a new strawberry bed. The produce is taken to the tearooms, and the vast majority of it is used on site. We get to eat here, too.</p> <p>I work until 4.30pm, then my time is my own. Wandering down to the sea takes a couple of minutes. If I\u2019m not there, then I might go climbing. I like walking a lot. I have a Facebook account I check every couple of days, but apart from that, internet culture really doesn\u2019t interest me. I don\u2019t see the point.</p> <p>My apprenticeship is for two years. I\u2019m not sure what I\u2019ll do next, but I\u2019d like to study and become a dendrologist [an expert on trees and shrubs], if things go to plan. But I\u2019m content for now.</p> <h2><strong>Kristy Duncan, 38, wildlife conservationist trainee, London</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8fcc6df168e92de0678ddba0936b2214fcebd2e7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8fcc6df168e92de0678ddba0936b2214fcebd2e7/0_776_5906_3543/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Kristy Duncan\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Kristy Duncan: \u2018Doing this job is like an outdoor gym, but better.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ben Quinton for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I was a dental nurse in Scotland for many years. I didn\u2019t realise I could have a career in the environmental sector; I\u2019d always thought of it as a hobby. But when I moved back down to London, I started volunteering with the <a href=\"http://www.wildlondon.org.uk/\">Wildlife Trust</a> and I saw an advert for the course I\u2019m now on.</p> <p>Most of the week, we\u2019re outside. There is a lot of grassland management, clearing scrubs, coppicing. Then, once a week we have to go to the devil\u2019s drawing room (that\u2019s how I think of central London) for classroom sessions. That\u2019s my least favourite day, but honestly there\u2019s nothing I would change about my current life. Every day I wake up and I feel blessed; I don\u2019t get that sense of dread any more.</p> <p>I had lost two stone before becoming a trainee because I hadn\u2019t been well, and at first I felt quite weak. But I soon became strong again, and now I\u2019m at my healthiest. Doing this work is like an outdoor gym, but better. It makes sense though, doesn\u2019t it? If you look at human beings in the past, they never exercised for fun. It\u2019s strange how we\u2019re more sedentary, how we\u2019re having to create environments for exercise when we could just be out in the world.</p> <p>Working outdoors has given me a bigger appreciation of the rain, which surprised me. When we started in October, it was torrential rain, really horrendous weather, and I loved it. You feel quite energised. It beats scraping the saliva out of someone\u2019s mouth.</p> <p>When I graduate, I want to work in woodland management. I\u2019d like to get involved in forest schools, and make sure we reach out into the community to show people what\u2019s on their doorstep. I\u2019m always urging my friends and family to get more involved, but it\u2019s not easy. It\u2019s about having a certain mindset, and understanding that these spaces can build connections between different groups of people and benefit a whole community.</p> <h2><strong>Ben Rayner, 39, outdoor learning leader, Sussex</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"da0f672fdd763073a9f2b900285580f506f4bdbc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/da0f672fdd763073a9f2b900285580f506f4bdbc/0_598_5906_3544/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ben Rayner\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ben Rayner: \u2018It\u2019s amazing how spending a day in the country can transform people.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ben Quinton for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>My official title is corporate training and developmental coordinator, which means I run courses for groups that involve a lot of physical activity: it might be kayaking, or climbing, or orienteering. We see a lot of people who have recently graduated who are great at computer work or interacting on social media, but they struggle with picking up a phone or talking face to face. It\u2019s amazing how spending a day in the country can transform people. You might see someone with a reputation for being really quiet in the office suddenly become the loudest, most proactive person when they\u2019re faced with a challenge course. Today I had a team of adults who all had behavioural problems as children and were struggling with employment. We did a day out on the pond, kayaking, stand-up paddleboarding, and everyone was just so relaxed and engaged; it was great.</p> <p>I used to be a mobile phone salesman, working in the City of London and the home counties. It was a very target-driven, stressful job, and I was on my laptop till 10pm. I always had this thought in the back of my head that I should be doing this instead.</p> <p>I ended up taking a voluntary role in the Lake District for six months. They took me under their wing and paid for a lot of my qualifications. In my spare time I was kayaking and climbing, just to clock up the hours.</p> <p>My wife calls me a winter husband. During the summer, I\u2019m often working from 8am until 10 at night, or I\u2019m away on an overnight session. But I can take three weeks off at Christmas. We do work all year round. A couple of years ago, a lake froze over completely and we had a group of teenagers who were meant to be out on the water. We just put them in dry suits and got them to use the canoes as icebreakers. They had the best time, and I think some of the best work we do is in the winter \u2013 when people are up against it in the rain and at their wits\u2019 end. That\u2019s when people have life-changing experiences.</p>",
  "<p>At 8.45am on a grey Saturday, having trudged through <a href=\"http://friendsofeatonpark.co.uk/\">Norwich\u2019s Eaton Park</a> to join a milling crowd of 500 people, it hits me that what I\u2019m about to do is unwise. I am the kind of sedentary home-worker whose heart pummels his ribcage when he thinks of running for the bus, a former Sunday morning footballer whose only reason to sprint around a park is after a five-year-old daughter who has mastered her bicycle\u2019s pedals but not its brakes; and here I am surrounded by fit people, the sort who seem happy standing in a cool breeze wearing skimpy garments made of Lycra and polyester mesh.</p> <p>After heading to the start line we\u2019re off, the crowd diverging within moments into a bounding vanguard with one eye on their fitness apps, and the rest of us experiencing that strange horizontal sinking as we move back towards our natural place in the hierarchy. In my experience, parks are better appreciated at a walking pace, but for now we must puff our way around a 5km course that I have compartmentalised into manageable stretches: from the skate park to the football pitches, to the model boat pond by the grand circular colonnaded pavilion, to the miniature railway and the rose garden, the playground, the cycle speedway, the pitch and putt. And repeat three and a half times.</p> <p>This is <a href=\"http://www.parkrun.org.uk/\">Parkrun</a>, one of many ways in which parks are now reasserting themselves as important civic spaces in a society where fewer people have jobs that keep them fit, or budgets that stretch to gym memberships. Every weekend tens of thousands of people all over Britain are doing this, or attending military-style boot camps, or working out at a growing number of outdoor gyms. Earlier this year the parish council at Stoke Gifford, near Bristol, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/apr/13/stoke-gifford-parkrun-council-condemned-charge-paula-radcliffe\">controversially tried</a> to charge Parkrun for using Little Stoke Park, a sign of the financial pressures that parks are under \u2013 despite the fact that many have lately been regenerated by national lottery money after decades of decline. Stoke Gifford\u2019s organisers <a href=\"http://www.parkrun.org.uk/littlestoke/news/\">preferred to close the run</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2f0af7fd8e5ac28236a987f91df616c29eb5a723\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2f0af7fd8e5ac28236a987f91df616c29eb5a723/195_172_5794_3477/1000.jpg\" alt=\"St James\u2019s, London, with Buckingham Palace and the Queen Victoria memorial in the distance\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">St James\u2019s, London, with Buckingham Palace and the Queen Victoria memorial in the distance.

On a sunny summer afternoon it looks impeccable, even though its position beside the river Ouse meant it lay beneath metres of water during last December\u2019s floods. The only blemish is the paths\u2019 coating of droppings from a resident flock of Canada geese \u2013 enough of a problem for the council to have erected signs requesting visitors not to feed them. Here on any given day you might find young children enjoying a forest school session, or adults engaged in tai chi, orienteering, volleyball or gardening, or a purposeful march along the paths in a Nordic walking group.</p> <p>Joanna Ezekiel, 46, has recently taken up Nordic walking, but when I meet her she is sitting on a bench, happy to be distracted from reading War And Peace on her Kindle. A novelist, poet and Open University tutor, she tells me she values parks as a place to reflect or find inspiration. In 1993, she and her father saw <a href=\"https://www.artangel.org.uk/project/house/\">Rachel Whiteread\u2019s House</a> (a concrete cast of a Victorian terraced house) at Wennington Green in London\u2019s East End, when Ezekiel was working nearby as a newly qualified teacher. \u201cI hadn\u2019t heard of it, but was absolutely fascinated by its startling and haunting presence on an ordinary east London green,\u201d she says. It inspired the plot of her young adult novel, <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23227476-the-inside-out-house\">The Inside-Out House</a>.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>A lot of ice-cream vendors have come into conflict with their local parks. The big boys come in offering silly money</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Now that Ezekiel lives in York, Rowntree Park has become somewhere she can always find a peaceful spot to think or read. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/the-northerner/2012/jul/12/libraries-universityofyork\">park\u2019s cafe</a> is run by the city\u2019s recently outsourced library service, though the bustling little space is, in the words of chief executive Fiona Williams, \u201cmore cafe than library\u201d. A knitting club meets there weekly, as do reading groups; there are Wordless Wednesdays, when people gather to read and work and anyone speaking louder than a whisper is asked to quieten down.</p> <p>Parks have long been a source of inspiration for artists and writers: all human life goes on within them, and they form the backdrop to experiences spanning the sublime, the exciting, the amusing and the tragic. Last month, for instance, a baby <a href=\"http://www.blackpoolgazette.co.uk/news/update-woman-arrested-after-baby-girl-found-in-park-1-8030629\">was allegedly abandoned in a park in Blackpool</a>, and in east London <a href=\"http://www.itv.com/news/london/2016-07-25/sunbather-run-over-by-council-van-while-lying-in-a-park/\">a sunbather was run over</a> by a council van; there was a heated debate over <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/jul/22/is-it-ok-to-sunbathe-in-undies-stripping-off-heatwave-sparks-debate\">whether it was OK to lie in the park in your underwear</a>, and Doncaster residents <a href=\"http://www.doncasterfreepress.co.uk/news/doncaster-residents-in-call-to-reclaim-parks-after-spate-of-serious-incidents-1-8006436\">called for the reintroduction of park wardens</a> after a series of assaults.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"ab0140aa5a5f100e91927ff896f5c14edfb8c2e6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ab0140aa5a5f100e91927ff896f5c14edfb8c2e6/4_487_5991_3595/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Cawston Brass Band play Eaton Park\u2019s grand pavilion in Norwich.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Cawston Brass Band play Eaton Park\u2019s grand pavilion in Norwich.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Simon Roberts/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The old-fashioned parkie is rarely spotted these days, but the few remaining staff with decades of experience have good stories to tell. Chris Lines, who works for Liverpool city council, is no longer fazed by seeing dog-walkers joined by people with cats, ferrets or even deer on leads, but he was taken aback when a CCTV camera at Croxteth Hall Country Park showed <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjnIVer6Loc\">what appeared to be a ghostly figure</a> emerging from the bushes, \u201cwalking across the lawns and up the steps of the hall\u201d. Some say it\u2019s the spirit of the 7th Earl of Sefton, the hall\u2019s former owner, who died in 1972; others that it\u2019s a trick of the light. Lines tells me a ranger once excelled himself by spotting an ice-cream van and, on being told to verify the operator\u2019s name and check his permit, replying that there was no need as it was written on the vehicle: Mr Whippy.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.keepbritaintidy.org/20-years-commitment-to-green-flag-award-for-chris-worman-mbe/2704/2/1/999/\">Chris Worman</a> works for Rugby\u2019s parks service, though his voluntary role as a judge for Keep Britain Tidy\u2019s Green Flag awards takes him around the country. One of his favourite memories, he says, came just a few weeks ago: \u201cIn Rugby, the day after the European referendum, we had a Polish picnic in the park as a way of saying that, whatever Brexit means, they are still a part of our community. They\u2019re going to do it next year, too.\u201d</p> <p>Stephen Beech has worked in parks and cemeteries for 49 years. Today he helps maintain <a href=\"http://www.sbg.org.uk/\">Sheffield Botanical Gardens</a> but previously he worked at the city\u2019s Endcliffe Park, where his duties included preparing the hire boats for the boating lake. There was a notorious swan, he says, \u201cthat didn\u2019t have a mate and got very aggressive\u201d. One day he and the head park-keeper were attacked: \u201cIt cornered us into the boatshed. We kept looking out through the cracks, and it stood there aggressively flapping its wings. We were stuck for 15 minutes until it decided it had had enough.\u201d</p> <p>Back in York\u2019s Rowntree Park, I pass a dovecote and a fountain bearing a statue of the Roman god Mercury, before meeting Jane Blackwood, a lawyer who is pushing her baby son in his buggy. \u201cI really love the fact the park\u2019s got a river running through it,\u201d she tells me. In the last couple of years, <a href=\"http://www.yorkpress.co.uk/news/10516856.Ice_cream_boat_sets_sail_on_the_River_Ouse/\">the Two Hoots floating ice-cream parlour</a>, an old tugboat and ice-cream van skilfully blended, has become a distinctive sight chugging up the river to its mooring here. \u201cI\u2019ve had a few lovely sunny afternoons eating those ice-creams with my toddler on the riverbank,\u201d she says, \u201cwaving to the tourist boats while the baby snoozes in the pushchair. Nothing out of the ordinary, but pretty magical to me.\u201d</p> <p>The more conventional ice-cream van is a classic feature of any British park on a summer\u2019s day, but even this now faces challenges. I\u2019m told this by Maurice Murray, whose cheery attitude and charity fundraising have prompted the Ice Cream Alliance <a href=\"http://www.ice-cream.org/news/fleetwood-ice-cream-man-voted-best-britain\">to name him its 2016 Mobiler of the Year</a> (\u201cmobiler\u201d is the preferred term for someone selling ice-cream from a vehicle). Murray\u2019s blue-and-white van is a familiar sight around the parks and streets of Fleetwood, Lancashire, chiming out Teddy Bears\u2019 Picnic or, on days when Manchester City are playing, Blue Moon. He loves the job, but some ice-cream sellers who have pitches in parks are facing difficulties with the authorities, he explained. \u201cI run a closed Facebook group for ice-cream mobilers and a lot of them have come into conflict with their local parks. We have one who\u2019s been in his local park for 25 years and his local authority have decided to put [the pitch] out to tender. Then the big boys come in offering silly money \u2013 and when they start paying high rents, obviously they\u2019ve got to get the money back. That\u2019s when it goes from your local man who\u2019s done it for 25 years and kept the prices low for local people, to prices that are inflated to maximise the profit. These are some of the problems that parks nowadays are having.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"7bb1b2ca0f03628f6614e55af46f1f4a5ac1bc0a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7bb1b2ca0f03628f6614e55af46f1f4a5ac1bc0a/56_543_5944_3567/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Cricket in Norwich\u2019s Eaton Park.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Scott Poulson (bowling) and son Arlo (far right, in white) mark their birthdays in Norwich\u2019s Eaton Park.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Simon Roberts/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Like Parkrun, this points towards the broader issue of how government cuts and councils\u2019 finances are affecting Britain\u2019s 27,000 public parks. The communities and local government select committee <a href=\"http://www.parliament.uk/business/committees/committees-a-z/commons-select/communities-and-local-government-committee/news-parliament-2015/public-parks-launch-16-17/\">opened an inquiry</a> into the subject last month, with written submissions welcome until 30 September. One person sure to contribute is Dave Morris, with whom I take a wander around <a href=\"http://lordshiprec.org.uk/\">Lordship Recreation Ground</a> in north London. Here we see young men using the \u00a3100,000 outdoor gym (\u201cBecause local authorities now have responsibility for ill-health prevention strategies,\u201d Morris explains), and a class of blue-jumpered schoolchildren studying nature by the pond.</p> <p>Morris is part of the park\u2019s not-for-profit co-operative management team. He is also chair of the <a href=\"http://www.natfedparks.org.uk/\">National Federation of Parks and Green Spaces</a> and a battle-hardened campaigner who was one of the \u201cMcLibel Two\u201d. With Helen Steel, he took on McDonald\u2019s in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McLibel_case\">a 20-year legal saga</a> that, even if the fast-food chain ultimately won, damaged its reputation.</p> <p>Over lunch at the straw-bale-built Hub building, which combines a cafe with rooms for yoga, dance and art classes, Morris argues that we\u2019re in the middle of \u201ca major crisis: there needs to be a massive public outcry in defence of the UK\u2019s urban green spaces\u201d. He cites a <a href=\"https://www.hlf.org.uk/state-uk-public-parks\">Heritage Lottery Fund report</a> from 2014, which produced a bleak set of figures. It revealed that 86% of parks managers had seen budget cuts since 2010, and expected them to continue until 2017; 81% of council parks departments had lost skilled management staff, and 77% had lost frontline staff; 45% of local authorities were looking at selling their parks and green spaces or outsourcing their management. A <a href=\"http://www.cfpuk.co.uk/stateofukpublicparks/\">follow-up report</a> next month is expected to show further cuts.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Even on a busy Saturday morning there's no traffic to be heard, only children whooping and birdsong</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Across London, Hammersmith and Fulham council thought it had found a solution. In 2013, the Conservative-run administration agreed to hand over around a third of Hammersmith Park to the private business Play Football, which would convert this publicly accessible land into paid-entry football pitches and run the centre under a 35-year lease. But after a Labour win in the May 2014 council election, and a noisy campaign of local opposition that went to judicial reviews funded by the writer Virginia Ironside, the centre <a href=\"https://www.lbhf.gov.uk/articles/news/2016/02/free-football-pitches-residents-open-white-city\">opened this year in a very different form</a>. \u201cIt\u2019s been an amazing outcome,\u201d Ironside tells me. \u201cA much smaller area has been made into football pitches. These are all owned by the council, which retained full ownership of the park with no leases involved. Play Football have a management contract for seven years, which is renewable or not, depending on how it goes.\u201d</p> <p>Our parks have long been political spaces, a managed approximation of the rural in the midst of our towns and cities, and as such prey to conflicting intentions. Even their founding motivation had its flip side: when Victoria Park <a href=\"http://www.towerhamlets.gov.uk/lgnl/leisure_and_culture/parks_and_open_spaces/victoria_park/victoria_park.aspx\">opened as London\u2019s first public park in 1845</a>, it was a patrician gesture aimed at improving the health of the downtrodden, dock-working cockney proletariat; but its advocates also included those who wished to deter them from heading west to the fashionable parks of central London, bringing their diseases with them. (Likewise, Liverpool\u2019s beautiful Victorian parks were created not just to give workers respite from the industrial smoke and cholera-infested slums, but because their employers knew a healthier workforce would be more productive.)</p> <p>The cultural historian <a href=\"https://traviselborough.co.uk/\">Travis Elborough</a> talks me through this as we walk around Victoria Park, often dubbed the \u201cgreen lungs of the East End\u201d, which in recent years <a href=\"http://www.standard.co.uk/news/victoria-park-to-get-12m-regeneration-6456060.html\">has seen \u00a312m of investment</a>. He locates the seeds of this change in the 1970s, when \u201cthe first generation of middle-class gentrifiers were buying a version of working-class community\u201d. There are still remnants of traditional London here, such as the <a href=\"http://vphthac.org.uk/\">Victoria Park Harriers and Tower Hamlets Athletics Club</a>, or the old boys who take pride in racing their finely engineered miniature speedboats in the pond. But then there are two modern cafes (homemade sourdough bread and crab Benedict at one, Indian street food at the other) and a recently established croquet club <a href=\"http://croqueteast.co.uk/\">whose website</a> features Edwardian-garbed ironists inviting us to \u201ccross mallets and bash balls whilst sipping Pimm\u2019s, munching cucumber sandwiches and discussing the relative merits of Sartre and Descartes\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"35ae956b83c3b1d5ab83535c3c6204bab411b53b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/35ae956b83c3b1d5ab83535c3c6204bab411b53b/39_17_5944_4462/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Dean\u2019s Park in York.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"751\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dean\u2019s Park in York.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Simon Roberts/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>As one of London\u2019s most popular green spaces, Victoria Park looks untouchable. Many more parks around Britain face a battle to remain intact, well-maintained and free of charge. Selling off parkland, transferring the management to corporate interests, \u201cinappropriate development\u201d and commercialisation \u2013 these are all strategies Dave Morris tells me he has seen authorities deploy. Even at the widely admired Lordship Rec, he and his colleagues faced a proposal last year from the council to build houses on a third of the land (\u201cI\u2019m glad to say they\u2019ve now backed down\u201d). Elsewhere, Morris says he is seeing \u201cstaffing decimated across the country\u201d, and \u201can increasing amount of large concerts, often at peak summer periods, causing disruption and damage\u201d. He mentions Finsbury Park\u2019s <a href=\"http://wirelessfestival.co.uk/\">Wireless festival</a>, which closes off a large area of land, and the fact that Wandsworth council <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battersea_Park_Street_Circuit\">has allowed Formula E racing</a> at Battersea Park. (A council spokesman tells me that last month\u2019s event was the second and final one, and that \u00a3400,000 of the \u00a32.85m it made will be ringfenced for the park; the remainder will fund essential services such as libraries.)</p> <p>Similar tensions are playing out wherever you look. In Newcastle this spring there was uproar when the council considered \u2013 though later rejected \u2013 the adventure playground company Go Ape\u2019s proposal to convert <a href=\"http://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/news/north-east-news/petition-stop-go-ape-opening-11137219\">a chunk of Heaton Park into a visitor attraction</a>. Stockport residents were dismayed last year when <a href=\"http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/greater-manchester-news/council-bosses-approve-plans-new-8409764\">councillors agreed to allow 70 houses to be built</a> on two hectares of Reddish Vale Country Park. Unsurprisingly, it is the regions beyond London and south-east England that suffer most: according to the Heritage Lottery Fund report, Scotland, Wales and the north-west of England have the largest proportion of parks in decline.</p> <p>So how ought we to be covering the costs? <a href=\"http://www.nesta.org.uk/publications/learning-rethink-parks\">The Rethinking Parks project</a>, run jointly in 2014-15 by the Big Lottery Fund, the Heritage Lottery Fund and the charity Nesta, looked at 11 experimental approaches, publishing its results in February. One success was the Bristol ParkWork scheme, which saw 17 unemployed people given temporary maintenance roles in the city\u2019s parks: this led to seven later gaining jobs, while saving the council \u00a327,000. Another was Burnley\u2019s Go to the Park, a \u201cpermaculture\u201d project in which mowed lawns made way for wildflower meadows, and traditional Victorian planting schemes were changed into lower-maintenance ones featuring more perennials. This approach has saved the council nearly \u00a370,000.</p> <p>Until such ideas are widely established, it\u2019s hard to see beyond a short-term future of grinding attrition between cash-strapped councils and the 5,000-plus \u201cfriends\u201d groups that campaign on their local park\u2019s behalf. And as Elborough, author of the recently published <a href=\"https://www.penguin.co.uk/books/1098877/a-walk-in-the-park/\">A Walk In The Park</a>: The Life And Times Of A People\u2019s Institution, tells me, the tensions are older than you might imagine. Drinking a flat white by Victoria Park\u2019s duck pond, he explains that places such as <a href=\"http://www.vauxhallgardens.com/vauxhall_gardens_briefhistory_page.html\">Vauxhall Pleasure Gardens</a> were commercial entities, like theme parks: you had to pay admission. The country\u2019s first public park, the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derby_Arboretum\">Arboretum</a> in Derby, opened in 1840 and charged for entry five days a week; last year its current manager, Michael McNaught, reluctantly floated <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/lifestyle/wellbeing/outdoors/11908169/Britains-public-parks-175-years-old-but-will-they-survive.html\">the idea of reintroducing a fee</a> for visitors from outside the city.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9f808281ae240ee8134768f9e68c861e043bb5ce\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9f808281ae240ee8134768f9e68c861e043bb5ce/22_73_5938_3928/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Japanese garden in Hammersmith Park, London.

In the background, redevelopment continues at the former BBC Television Centre.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Simon Roberts/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Victoria Park was designed by James Pennethorne, one of the \u201cgreat tidy-uppers of London\u201d, Elborough points out. \u201cThe idea was that part of its construction would be paid for by the sale and development of luxury mansions or parkside villas. In the end that didn\u2019t really work, because the canal was a working canal and it\u2019s still the East End. But that, essentially, was one of the motors for its development \u2013 that you\u2019d have these nice luxury homes and they would make the money.\u201d The Victorian model has in many ways returned: a few miles north of here, <a href=\"http://www.berkeleygroup.co.uk/new-homes/london/finsbury-park/woodberry-down\">the Woodberry Down development</a> boasts \u201cluxury apartments\u201d with a view over \u201cacres of beautifully landscaped parkland\u201d.</p> <p>Back in Eaton Park in Norwich, my heart is thudding as I lie collapsed on the grass, gazing at the clouds, moments after achieving my modest target of completing the course without stopping. My time is 26 minutes 15 seconds, which puts me in 246th place, the winner having finished nine minutes earlier. I am almost exactly average, but it feels good to have proved a touch fitter than I feared, to have felt a brief camaraderie with strangers as we coaxed each other over the line, and simply to have the opportunity of running around an elegant green space so large that even on a busy Saturday morning there\u2019s no city traffic to be heard, only children whooping from the playground, birdsong and runners panting. If our parks are a city\u2019s lungs, they are also a good part of its soul: we sell them at a higher price than any council\u2019s accountants could begin to imagine.</p>",
  "<h2>Day eight briefing</h2> <p>After <strong>Sir Bradley Wiggins</strong> increased his jewellery collection to Mr T proportions, the athletics events finally kicked off and the diving pool water remained still green, what will day eight bring in Rio?</p> <h2>The big picture</h2> <p> Day seven will go down in history for a number of reasons, not least for the records that fell in the velodrome.

His eight medals \u2013 five of them gold \u2013 lift him above Chris Hoy as the G.O.A.T of Team GB and unless they reintroduce medals for poetry, like the one Pierre de Coubertin won in 1912, there\u2019s little left for the cycling great to achieve. That was bad luck for the Australians, who crossed the line 0.743 seconds slower for silver.</p> <p> Shots have been fired by Team USA\u2019s <strong>Hope Solo</strong>, and we\u2019re not talking about action at the gun range.

  "<h2>My brother, a Tefl teacher, wants to return to the UK \u2013 what are his job options?</h2> <p><strong>My brother has been a Tefl teacher for more than a decade and is head of a Tefl school for adults in Australia. He is also an accomplished musician. After a recent trip back home with his wife and children they have decided to come back for a year or two \u2013 potentially longer. It is all rather dependent on employment, of course, which is probably the first factor before location.</strong></p> <p><strong>My brother is a dedicated and passionate teacher. I feel teachers across the spectrum in this country are not valued (I say this as a teacher myself), so I\u2019d be really interested in your view and those of Tefl teachers here. Also, are there any areas in the UK with a particular need for Tefl teachers?</strong></p> <p><strong>Jeremy says</strong></p> <p>This is such a specialised inquiry that I can do little better than refer your brother to a good search engine. I\u2019ve surfed a bit myself and it\u2019s clear there is demand for experienced Tefl teachers in the UK, though I suspect opportunities for someone as senior as your brother may be few and far between.</p> <p>As far as location is concerned, it seems obvious that demand is most likely to be concentrated in the larger metropolitan areas such as London, Birmingham, Manchester and so on.</p> <p>But, as is so often the case, your brother\u2019s questions are most likely to be usefully answered by that small army of Guardian readers always so ready to share their first-hand knowledge.</p> <p><strong>Readers say </strong></p> <p>\u2022 Oxford, Cambridge and Bath have a year-round Tefl offer. Don\u2019t discount holiday revision courses too \u2013 Oxford is full of them and students are increasingly diverse, needing EFL and subject-specific tuition. <strong>Green123 </strong></p> <p>\u2022 I was in a similar situation when I moved back from Mexico. Initially the options were limited, but when a friend suggested looking at English as an additional language (EAL) posts in boarding schools, a whole world opened up. Many boarding schools rely on an intake of overseas pupils and a strong EAL department is essential to making a success of this strategy. <strong>juliafbird</strong></p> <p>\u2022 One option is to work at a summer school for kids. You can find these jobs at <a href=\"http://www.tefl.com/\">Tefl.com</a>. Another better-paid option is to get a job teaching EAP (English for academic purposes) at a university. The best way into this is to apply to teach on a pre-sessional summer course. These jobs are on <a href=\"http://www.jobs.ac.uk/\">Jobs.ac.uk</a>. It\u2019s not uncommon to be taken on for teaching work in the academic year following the summer course. You stand more of a chance if you have the Delta qualification, or an MA in Tesol and applied linguistics. <strong>Katy Yelland</strong></p> <p>\u2022 Lots of universities have partnerships with an organisation called <a href=\"http://www.intostudy.com/en-gb/about-into\">Into</a>, which helps international students brush up on their language skills before they start university. <strong>Scrowjane</strong></p> <p>\u2022 It\u2019s pointless teaching English as a foreign language in Britain. The job pays better and has more status in eastern Europe or Asia or Latin America. The real money is to be made in oil-producing countries. <strong>KarlNaylor75</strong></p> <p>\u2022 I\u2019ve worked as and recruited teachers into EAP in a university. The jobs are advertised on university websites, <a href=\"http://www.jobs.ac.uk/\">Jobs.ac.uk</a> and <a href=\"http://baleap.org/\">Baleap.org</a>. You will need a diploma (Delta) or master\u2019s in applied linguistics. The Delta is better and can be studied part-time and more cheaply. <strong>possumpossum</strong></p> <h2>I\u2019m good at making things. What I need is a job that will allow me to do it</h2> <p><strong>I face a bit of a conundrum. I feel as if I have a million skills but, for love nor money, I seem unable/incapable of finding the career I want. I am 32 and for 16 years have worked in hospitality for a large IT company. I believe I am good at it, but my heart\u2019s not in it.</strong></p> <p><strong>What do I want? To make stuff. Vague, I hear you say. Agreed. All I can say is that every non-work moment of my day is spent making things, from robots to garden watering systems to gaming consoles. I have looked into the model-making and movie prop industries but have come up against the standard excuse for us Generation X people \u2013 how much experience do you have? </strong></p> <p><strong>How do I find a job that allows me to make things without the catch-22 of in-work experience \u2026 of making things?</strong></p> <p><strong>Jeremy says</strong></p> <p>If you were a would-be graphic designer you\u2019d have compiled a portfolio and would be assiduous in keeping it fresh and contemporary. I wonder if you\u2019ve attempted to compile the equivalent of a portfolio of your inventions. If you haven\u2019t, as an obsessive maker of things this challenge should appeal to you.</p> <p>I\u2019ve no idea how you might go about it or what form your \u201cportfolio\u201d might take, but you should be able to produce something. I imagine you have photographic records of at least some of your constructions or, if not, could soon produce them.</p> <p>The point I\u2019m making is that in the absence of formal employment experience, hard physical evidence of your competence could be an excellent substitute. The more ingenious and imaginative you can make such an exhibit, the more effective it can be. Its very construction proves your abilities.</p> <p>Then you should see if you can attract a little publicity. You could start a blog about your passion, passing on hints to others. And maybe attract a mention in your local paper with a photograph of one of your constructions. It doesn\u2019t have to be a great feature: just enough for you to add to your credentials.</p> <p>If you can achieve some or all of this, plus any other thoughts that may occur to you, you start from a stronger position when you approach model-making or film prop companies. You will not be an inexperienced amateur but an interesting individual with evident talent, and even something of an established reputation.</p> <p><strong>Readers say </strong></p> <p>\u2022 Have you thought about doing videos of your model making and putting them on YouTube? They should be delivered as if you were demonstrating to an audience \u2013 you can edit to fast-forward the slower sections. You can then send a link to your YouTube channel with your CV as proof of your skills. <strong>sojomo </strong></p> <p>\u2022 Make things you think people might want to buy and put them on eBay. Something will sell for a big margin. Make more to check it wasn\u2019t a one-off. Next, set up as a sole trader and get a website going. Be unique, sell for good margins and take pride in quality and customer service. If and when you get bored of working alone you\u2019ll have more than enough skills to get a job you want. <strong>8rocko</strong></p> <p>\u2022 Think broader: architects need models, training companies need training rigs and demo sets, hospitality companies need one-off giveaways, colleges need displays \u2026 <strong>Justabloke</strong></p> <p>\u2022 Your skills may be well used in the engineering sector \u2013 I am told it\u2019s easier to get into than creative industries. Look for apprenticeships, then after some training and experience you could move into something more creative and practical. <strong>gertrudefeigenbaum</strong></p>",
  "<p>Fraudsters can contact Barclays bank, pose as a customer, ask for that person\u2019s account address to be changed, then take out huge loans against their name \u2013 as one Nottingham teacher has found to her deep distress. Jude Grundy was just days away from moving home when the nightmare began, with her debit card being refused at a supermarket checkout.</p> <p>It later emerged that two weeks previously fraudsters had called Barclays, claimed to be her, and changed her address. They were then able to open a second linked account and apply for a new debit card. With that card the crooks were then able to obtain a \u00a324,000 loan from Barclays and a \u00a3750 overdraft, as well as topping it off by stealing \u00a34,000 in savings from Grundy and her husband, Andrew. She only found out about the linked account when, curiously, \u00a32,000 was transferred<em> </em>into her account.

I had been told the account was up and running again, but no one appears to have noticed it had been ransacked,\u201d she says, describing her treatment by Barclays as shockingly bad. Not only did it hand control over her account to fraudsters, it then closed it, leaving all her usual direct debits unpaid. The timing could not have been worse. The mother of two should have spent the week packing, as the family completed on their first house purchase the following Friday.</p> <p>\u201cThe staff who decided to freeze the account in the first place had not noticed any of this suspicious activity, it seems. They were happy to just pass it back to me,\u201d Grundy says.</p> <p>She says staff at Barclays were sympathetic, but helpless to stop colleagues from closing the accounts without warning \u2013 a week before they were due to move house.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I couldn\u2019t believe what I was seeing \u2026 no one appears to have noticed our account had been ransacked</p> <footer> <cite>Jude Grundy</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Only the next day did a letter arrive telling the couple that the bank had decided to shut their account, and that they must withdraw any funds held \u2013 which was impossible because the account had already been closed.</p> <p>\u201cBuying a house was stressful enough without having to go through this as well, and you don\u2019t know how many hours I have spent trying to get it all resolved,\u201d she says. \u201cI still don\u2019t know how the fraudsters were able to call up Barclays, change my address and get a loan. I\u2019ve been told they had lots of information on me, but I have two passwords on the account which I don\u2019t think the fraudsters were asked for, and I\u2019ve certainly never divulged them to anyone else.</p> <p>\u201cThe whole thing has been unbelievable, shockingly bad, and I never want to hear their \u2018on-hold\u2019 music ever again.\u201d</p> <p>A Barclays spokesman accepted that the episode had not been the bank\u2019s finest hour and it has now agreed to pay the couple \u00a31,000 in compensation for the two failures. It has also paid for the couple to tax their car, which was one of the failed direct debits. All the other direct debits have now been reinstated, the loan has been cancelled, the savings restored, and the couple\u2019s accounts are now running correctly again.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2016/apr/16/sim-swap-fraud-mobile-banking-fraudsters\">Sim-swap fraud claims another mobile banking victim</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u2022 Barclays, which has been at the centre of several frauds reported by Money in recent years, has just started offering customers the option to use voice recognition software as a way to establish their identity when they call the bank.</p> <p>The technology recognises a customer\u2019s unique formation of words, cancelling the need for security questions or passwords.

  "<p>O2 mobile users heading abroad should check if the travel bolt-on package, automatically charged to phones on arrival overseas, is suitable for them, after several people found they were being charged excessive amounts for sending the odd text message while on holiday.</p> <p>Thousands of the firm\u2019s customers heading to Europe are automatically paying \u00a31.99 each day they use their phone on holiday, unless they\u2019ve opted out of the travel bolt-on option. Many will want it, but the company has admitted to Guardian Money that any pay-monthly user who has previously signed up for the O2 travel service has automatically been opted in to pay the daily charge while away, even though in many cases they may be better off without it.</p> <p>As soon as an O2 customer uses their mobile in a chargeable way while abroad, the fee is added to their account for that 24-hour period \u2013 even if they only send one text. Many will be unaware of the change, with complaints that the text sent by O2 outlining the service is not clear.</p> <p>Roaming charges have been slashed since the firm introduced the bolt-on option. For those making lots of calls or using data while abroad the package is great value, and gives near certainty on what your roaming bill will be. The plan offers users unlimited data and up to 120 minutes of calls and 120 texts each day \u2013 all for \u00a31.99 per day in Europe, \u00a33.99 per day in Turkey, or \u00a34.99 in 30 other countries including the US and Australia.</p> <p>It\u2019s a boon for big mobile users, but not all customers are happy about the change, which came into force in April. Alfredo Filho from Kent contacted Money this week to complain that he had been charged \u00a321 to send a few texts while on holiday in France, unaware he was paying the high daily charge.</p> <p>\u201cI sent the odd text and was careful not to use any other services,\u201d he says. \u201cI was charged \u00a31.99 a day, repeatedly, for texts that would previously have cost less than 5p each. It is the textbook definition of a rip-off: a unilateral change in contract, certain to benefit the firm, while customers are not informed adequately and not offered an alternative.\u201d</p> <p>An O2 spokesman says customers were told of the change and can choose between the bolt-on or paying roaming charges. \u201cTravellers can text O2TRAVEL to 23336 to opt in to the service, or NOTRAVEL to 23336 for standard roaming rates to apply. It can take up to 24 hours for the bolt-on to be added or removed.\u201d He says Filho\u2019s charges are valid but that as a gesture of goodwill for confusion about the change, O2 will credit him the charges in his next bill.</p> <h2>Digital doubts on EE bill<br></h2> <p>Are you unwittingly making lots of small payments of \u00a32.99 to EE for something called a \u201cdigital charge\u201d? <em>asks Patrick Collinson</em>. <br></p> <p>One reader thought it was because he had exceeded his data limit, but was shocked to discover he had somehow been subscribed to an online games portal called Playmaniax. He joins many other EE customers who have complained about mysterious payments to the service, with some saying they never agreed to join or pay for it. <br></p> <p>Complainants are told that they must have clicked on a link and that they should contact Playmaniax to unsubscribe. In our reader\u2019s case, EE said he had been sent notifications on how to unsubscribe, and when he did, payments were immediately halted. <br></p> <p>The reader says: \u201cI was working that day, teaching computing science \u2026 there was no way I actively followed a sign-up process.\u201d He says the sums are relatively trivial, but warns other readers to check their bills.

But if tourism is not sustainable, we risk ruining the very thing that tourists would come to see.\u201d</p> <p>The Crystal Serenity will set sail from Seward, Alaska, for New York on a 32-day, near 1,000-mile journey through the famous Northwest Passage waterway via Canada and Greenland. </p> <p>Arguments around the Arctic have more recently centred on oil company drilling such as Shell\u2019s controversial and now abandoned attempts to explore off the coast of Alaska and new plans to open up the Norwegian far north.</p> <p>But the increasing scope for <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Polar-Opposites-Opportunities-threats-Guardian-ebook/dp/B0076KWQ7M\">industrialising the region</a> as the ice melts has also <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/ng-interactive/2015/jun/16/drilling-oil-gas-arctic-alaska\">triggered geopolitical tensions and talk of a new cold war because the legal status of who owns what up there is uncertain</a>.</p> <p>Michael Byers, a professor of politics and law at the University of British Columbia, says the Crystal Serenity <a href=\"http://www.theglobeandmail.com/opinion/why-trudeau-should-move-now-to-safeguard-the-northwest-passage/article31382232/\">should be used to spur new talks between the Canadian and US governments about disputed waterway rights in the Arctic</a>.</p> <p>On its website, Crystal Cruises describes the cruises as a  \u201cworld away from the sunny Mediterranean and the Caribbean\u2019s white sandy beaches, cruises around the polar regions offer an entirely different adventure.</p> <p>\u201cSince these are luxury cruises, you could spend your days at sea in a hot whirlpool out on deck, glass of wine in hand \u2013 or head ashore on an expedition, learning more about these remote ecosystems with the help of expert guides,\u201d said the Los Angeles-based company.</p> <p>In a statement, Crystal Cruises said it was taking great care with the sailing. It had been \u201cworking on this project since 2013 and will be implementing a number of additional precautions to ensure the safety of all guests and crew, as well as to protect the pristine environment. </p> <p>\u201cWe have taken many extraordinary operational and equipment-related measures to ensure a safe voyage. The typical conditions along the planned route during the Arctic summer are substantially free of ice and within Crystal Serenity\u2019s safe-operating parameters.</p> <p>\u201cOf note is our intention to use ultra low-sulphur content marine gas oil, which far exceeds the current requirements in that region. This, along with a relatively slow transit speed, will achieve our goal of minimising our carbon footprint.\u201d</p> <p>The Crystal Serenity will carry 1,000 passengers \u2013 some reputed to be paying up to $120,000 (\u00a392,000) \u2013 plus 650 crew members. There is a casino, six restaurants and a cinema on board. The vessel is by far the largest luxury cruise ship to sail through these remote, icy waters.</p> <p>Crystal Serenity will be accompanied by an ice\u2013strengthened polar logistics vessel, RRS Ernest Shackleton, for safety backup. The vessel is normally used by the British Antarctic Survey (BAS), a publicly-funded organisation. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-36541583\">Concerns have been raised</a> about this but a spokesman for the BAS said it had no authority over how the vessel was employed in the summer months and made no financial gain from the Crystal Serenity work.</p>",

Tonight the teams are competing against each other rather than simply riding their own race one at a time. That brings an advantage for the faster team in the pairing, because they can benefit from what British Cycling (BC) refer to as \u201ccirculating air mass\u201d. In other words, slipstream. The faster team can get into their rivals\u2019 slipstream, even if they are still some way from lapping them. The boffins at BC reckon the advantage can be worth 20-30watts. That\u2019s what they call a marginal gain.</p> <p>2. Someone might have shut the velodrome doors. It certainly feels hotter in here tonight. Dame Sarah Storey reportedly reckons she narrowly failed at breaking the women\u2019s hour record because someone opened the doors in the velodrome in London. </p> <p>3.

I personally think there\u2019s far two many opportunities to win multiple medals as apart from breaststroke you don\u2019t need to be a specialist, whereas in pretty much all the other sports you do. I\u2019ve always thought a good idea would be to have a \u2018championship\u2019 for each stroke- each swimmer does each distance in a particular stroke, they get a certain number of points depending on where they finish in each one, and you then get one overall winner for the four disciplines. It\u2019d certainly make the watching less interminable as you\u2019d have a running score each day and you could still have relays to keep up the nationalism.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57ad9ea2e4b024cdec3d6d6f\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-08-12T10:02:29.459Z\">11.02am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/2016/06/brexit-companion/embed/embed.html?id=become_supporter\" data-alt=\"Support the Guardian\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/2016/06/brexit-companion/embed/embed.html?id=become_supporter\">Support the Guardian</a> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57ad9c0ee4b0fe7550975124\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-08-12T09:51:52.960Z\">10.51am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>I think somebody may mean business \u2026</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/caster800m/status/764028255867441152\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"und\" dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://t.co/oHyeoCUCzH\">pic.twitter.com/oHyeoCUCzH</a></p>&mdash; Caster Semenya (@caster800m) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/caster800m/status/764028255867441152\">August 12, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-08-12T09:53:10.349Z\">at 10.53am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57ad9b52e4b0fe755097511d\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-08-12T09:49:10.887Z\">10.49am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Now then, I mentioned a little earlier that we\u2019ve got the culmination of the team dressage competition</strong> with the grand prix special, having had the grand prix yesterday.

  "<p>Families come in all shapes and sizes, as the photographs on this page illustrate. But, though they portray a range of disparate families, these images are not all they seem. Each one features the same woman \u2013 Dita Pepe, who is also the photographer. In one image she is a bohemian mother, in another a country farmer. Yet another appears to portray her with the latest addition to her large family and elsewhere, she\u2019s in a wedding dress, child in arms.</p> <p>Dita is known as \u201cthe chameleon photographer\u201d because she puts herself into the frame \u2013 playing with the idea of what makes us the people we are, and asking the question: If I had been born into a different family, who would I be?</p> <p>Unsurprisingly, her work has its origins in her own experience of family life. Dita, 43, grew up in what was then Czechoslovakia in the days of communism. This, combined with the fact that her father was a very dominant character, meant she \u201clived in fear and under pressure for a long time\u201d. But what she calls the pathological relationships in her own family ultimately inspired her to explore relationships in other families. It helped her to empathise, she says, and gave her the ability to put things into context.</p> <p>She started to photograph families of friends and colleagues, and moved on to recruiting particular types of families: those from different ethnic backgrounds, city families and country families, wealthy families and poor families, nuclear families and extended families. \u201cI want to show the diversity of approaches to life, to open a door to places I didn\u2019t know existed or places I had prejudices about,\u201d she explains.</p> <p>\u201cI hope it\u2019s a journey of understanding, of tolerance, and I want to take the audience with me.\u201d</p> <p>More than anything, Dita says she is fascinated by how we are moulded by our surroundings and also by the extent to which couples shape one another in their relationship \u201cand how we apply the whole model again on our children\u201d.</p> <p>Everything, she says, is conditioned by the family we have been born into and the partners we find \u2013 but everything could so easily have been different, and in different circumstances we would have been different. \u201cWhen I\u2019m doing my photographs, I\u2019m thinking, I could have been born into this family, or I could have fallen in love with this man,\u201d she says.</p> <p>What it\u2019s all about, in essence, is tolerance. Sometimes, she says, it\u2019s good for all of us to consciously put our relationships and value system to one side, and to think about who we might be and what we might be without it.</p> <p>When she\u2019s working towards an image, Dita \u2013 whose work has been compared to that of the American feminist photographer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2016/jul/03/cindy-sherman-interview-retrospective-motivation\">Cindy Sherman</a> \u2013 spends as much time as possible with the family, absorbing their ethos and studying their modus operandi, their humour and the ways they communicate. \u201cI really want to know how they perceive their lives and it\u2019s inspiring to see what they like and what makes them happy,\u201d she says. \u201cI watch how they are with one another, how they look at each other, and then I make my picture of it all.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I visualise myself in a specific moment and it gives me a chance to see myself from a distance</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>She is, she says, conscious that the experience of being in one of her photoshoots \u201ccould be really traumatic for a child, to have to see a strange woman dressed as Mummy standing next to Daddy\u201d. She goes out of her way to explain the purpose of the photoshoots to the children. \u201cI try to make it into a game of dressing up because that\u2019s something children understand.\u201d</p> <p>It has also been an odd experience for her daughters, Ida and Ela, who are 13 and nine, who were recruited into the project as babies, often posing as extras in other people\u2019s family lineups. The trick, she says, has always been to make it feel like fun \u2013 and indeed fun is part of what it\u2019s all about. It has always been a whole-family event for her, too \u2013 as well as her daughters, her husband, Petr Hrube\u0161, is also a photographer and assists in the sessions.</p> <p>The women whom she \u201creplaces\u201d, she says, tend to find it a fascinating experience. \u201cI ask them all about themselves \u2013 what they like to wear, what they think suits them, what feels good to wear. When I try on their clothes, it\u2019s an interesting moment for me, but also for them \u2013 it\u2019s as though the woman is seeing herself from a distance, getting a different perspective on herself. Usually [where she\u2019s inserting herself into the family in place of the mother], I\u2019ll take a photo with the real mother. The situation around the photoshoot is always very natural and I\u2019d never force anyone to take part. I want it to be a game for everyone to enjoy.\u201d</p> <p>And yet, Dita admits, her work has another role \u2013 as therapy for herself. \u201cI visualise myself in a specific moment and it gives me a chance to see myself from a distance. It has helped me to overcome my fear of approaching strangers and it has made me realise I have the ability to control situations and the people in my life. I think I\u2019ve got more faith in myself. I\u2019ve taken responsibility for my own life.\u201d</p> <p>Most important of all, she says, is her hope that people who look at her work can identify with the families they portray, even if they are in very different circumstances and situations from their own. \u201cUnderstanding otherness and seeing things in context is a way to a better life, for all of us,\u201d she says.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.ditapepe.cz/\"><em>ditapepe.cz</em></a></p>",
  "<p>When David Wolfe was 16 he found a document in the loft at his family home that contained two extraordinary revelations. One was that he had a sister, born before him, who had been adopted. The second was that his father \u2013 whom he knew had died when he was not quite a year old \u2013 had been executed for murder.</p> <p>All David had known was that his father had died fighting for African freedom. His mother, Ann, had mentioned that one day in passing when he was about 12, after she overheard him talking to one of his friends about his father. But she didn\u2019t elaborate and David didn\u2019t pursue it: Ann\u2019s attitude had always been to look forward, never back; to seize the day, and the opportunities it contained. Like all children, David instinctively knew that this was his family\u2019s way of dealing with things; he made it his way, too.</p> <p>But now, at 16, the moment had come to find out the facts. On 24 July 1964, David\u2019s father, John Harris, a member of the African Resistance Movement \u2013 an anti-apartheid organisation that had until then confined itself mainly to blowing up electricity pylons \u2013 walked into the whites-only section of Johannesburg railway station and left a suitcase there that contained a bomb. It exploded just 13 minutes later, injuring several people seriously, in particular Glynnis Burleigh, 12, and her grandmother, Ethel Rhys, 77. Mrs Rhys died three weeks later from her injuries. Glynnis, who had 70% and third degree burns, was left with life-changing injuries.</p> <p>Harris \u2013 who appeared to have acted alone, since most of his fellow ARM members had either left the country or been imprisoned \u2013 was found guilty of murder and sentenced to death. On 1 April 1965, he was hanged \u2013 the only white person to be executed in South Africa for a crime against apartheid.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"d72719466b6d418e9daf1dde212fc6ccaf3c73d2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d72719466b6d418e9daf1dde212fc6ccaf3c73d2/118_0_689_800/431.jpg\" alt=\"John Harris with David as a baby.\" width=\"431\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">John Harris with David as a baby.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: HANDOUT</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Today, David is 52, a lawyer in London, and the father of teenage twin girls. As they have grown older they have become more interested in the unusual events surrounding their grandfather\u2019s death. But what has really forced David to think about his father\u2019s story is a Channel 4 documentary to be screened this month, in which he revisits Johannesburg, which he left as a small child, and talks to his mother (who has died since the programme was made) and others who were there at the time \u2013 friends of John who remember what he was like and what happened. And, most crucially, to Glynnis, the girl who was so badly injured.</p> <p>But the film is not \u2013 David is adamant \u2013 his personal journey or his assessment of what happened. The fact that he agreed to collaborate with the film-maker Simon Finch, though, has clearly made it what it is; as well as visiting the railway station in Johannesburg, and the wall in Freedom Park in Pretoria, where his father\u2019s name is inscribed with those of hundreds of others who sacrificed their lives to end apartheid, he also combed through his family\u2019s cine archive.</p> <p>The home movies that came to light allows the film to flesh out the larger-than-life, passionate man who was John Harris. And that must have been difficult for David, who seems like someone who favours a rational rather than an emotional approach to life. One of the most moving moments in the film is when he reads out the messages his father wrote to him and his mother from the death cell. However rational you are, and however much you try to transcend the baggage of your history, there are times when it wouldn\u2019t be human not to be touched; especially when it\u2019s your own story, and especially when your own story is so moving.</p> <p>The question at the heart of the documentary is this: what should David feel about John\u2019s crime? Are the sins of a father visited on his son? Does David feel \u2013 and should he feel \u2013 guilt for his father\u2019s actions?</p> <p>When we meet near his office, David weighs up these questions with even-handed detachment. On the issue of guilt, he is clear: he feels none. \u201cNone of us is responsible for our parents\u2019 actions. And in the same way, I can\u2019t take credit for anything my father did. Before the bombing, he was instrumental in organising the sports boycott that ultimately helped bring down apartheid. I take no more credit for that than I take any blame for his catastrophic mistake in thinking the railway station would be cleared.\u201d</p> <p>It all rests, in fact, on this. And while David may not feel guilt, he does feel it is important to defend his father\u2019s case. After leaving the bomb, John telephoned two newspapers and the railway police. \u201cThere\u2019s no doubt he gave those warnings and there\u2019s no doubt he expected them to be heeded,\u201d says David.</p> <p>So why wasn\u2019t the station cleared?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"69630bdcd78400906c61bbbe5db9b5871ec8fed7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/69630bdcd78400906c61bbbe5db9b5871ec8fed7/42_0_3392_2255/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Glynnis Burleigh with her grandmother, Ethel Rhys, on the beach before John Harris planted the bomb in 1965.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"665\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Glynnis Burleigh with her grandmother, Ethel Rhys, on the beach, in the days before John Harris planted the bomb in 1965.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: HANDOUT</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cThere\u2019s some evidence they took a calculated decision to do nothing,\u201d he says. Even if they did, though, 13 minutes seems a very brief time in which to avert a tragedy.</p> <p>The bombing, and even Mrs Rhys\u2019s death, played into the hands of the South African authorities, as did Harris\u2019s trial and execution; they wanted an anti-apartheid outrage in order to undermine the movement\u2019s credibility.</p> <p>Down through the decades, as well as in the immediate aftermath, John Harris\u2019s legacy has been fiercely debated by those closest to the apartheid struggle: was he a hero, was he foolish or was he a villain? He meant his actions to bring down a heinous political system but did he, in the end, hand it a gift?</p> <p>The central fact, says David, was that his father never disputed what he did. \u201cThe issue in the trial was the distinction between murder and manslaughter. But there was no jury: he was tried by a single judge sitting alone, a white establishment judge who was extremely unsympathetic.\u201d</p> <p>John Harris was 27 when he was hanged for murder. He and Ann are described in the film as inseparable, an observation borne out by a dip into a book called Truth is a Strange Fruit by David Beresford, the Guardian\u2019s late Johannesburg correspondent, which draws on the letters Harris sent as he waited to be executed in Pretoria.</p> <p>Realising there was little chance that his sentence would be commuted, Harris asked Ann to have \u201cthe happiest, fullest life you can manage, dearest, sweetest heart. My love for you means that I profoundly want you to have as much happiness as possible for your entire life. And there is the separate (but dependent) very important point \u2013 that David must have happy surroundings.\u201d</p> <p>In that same letter, Harris said Ann should \u201cnot exclude the possibility of remarriage, both for your happiness and for David\u2019s\u201d. And this is what happened: life in South Africa was very difficult for Ann after her husband\u2019s execution, and she returned to Britain where she met and married an environmentalist, Martin Wolfe, with whom she went on to have another son.</p> <p>Against the odds, David says his childhood was extremely happy. \u201cLots of people have complicated lives and I don\u2019t think mine has been any more complicated than anyone else\u2019s,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd lots of people have parents who die when they are children. What matters is not denying the past, but enjoying our loved ones, our children, our friends and family.\u201d</p> <p>Did he ever feel angry with his father for leaving him and his mother alone? Not really, he says: \u201cEveryone\u2019s life is full of Sliding Doors moments, and I don\u2019t really do them. Of course I feel frustration and sadness, but I wouldn\u2019t call it anger.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"e483ae1283b9edcab4eafa509143a87aaceb70ba\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e483ae1283b9edcab4eafa509143a87aaceb70ba/71_55_1150_690/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Glynnis Burleigh today.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Glynnis Burleigh today.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR Company Handout</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>After Harris\u2019s execution, his widow and baby went to live with friends \u2013 the Hains, whose son Peter would later move to Britain and become a prominent Labour politician and cabinet minister. Aged 15, Peter Hain read from the Book of Ecclesiastes at John\u2019s funeral (\u201cThere is a time to kill and a time to heal; a time to break down and a time to build up\u201d).</p> <p>David\u2019s life was changed for ever by the day his father planted the bomb at the train station in Johannesburg. But another child\u2019s life was changed in a different way. Photographs seen in the documentary show Glynnis Burleigh in childhood, tanned and fresh-faced on the beach \u2013 John Harris\u2019s bomb would leave her terribly scarred.</p> <p>When Simon Finch told David Wolfe that he had found Glynnis, David agreed to meet her. \u201cI felt it was the right thing to do, particularly if it was going to be helpful to her and helpful in the wider understanding of the situation,\u201d he says.</p> <p>Given that he doesn\u2019t feel he inherited his father\u2019s guilt, he didn\u2019t feel he should apologise to her \u2013 and he didn\u2019t. \u201cBut there is definitely a connection between us,\u201d he says, and their on-screen meeting is a sombre moment of reckoning. \u201cI don\u2019t think John Harris was a hero,\u201d says Glynnis in the film. \u201cHe might have been to others, but he wasn\u2019t a hero in my eyes. I see any form of terrorism as cowardly.\u201d</p> <p>When David says his father didn\u2019t mean the bomb to actually hurt anyone because he assumed the railway station would be cleared, Glynnis is adamant. \u201cHow would you put eight sticks of dynamite \u2026 next to a woman and a child and not expect it to hurt them?\u201d</p> <p>On one point, though, they agree. \u201cYou can\u2019t answer for your father,\u201d says Glynnis. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t expect you to.\u201d</p> <p>What, though, of that other family secret revealed by David\u2019s rummage in the loft when he was 16?</p> <p>Ann and John had met as teenagers and later had an unplanned pregnancy. Believing relatives would disapprove of them giving the baby away, they told their families that the child had died.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"e286402d7aa09b6c41ca2b96235b36200eb110d1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e286402d7aa09b6c41ca2b96235b36200eb110d1/71_414_3772_2263/1000.jpg\" alt=\"David Wolfe today.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">David Wolfe today.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Martin Godwin/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>At the time David discovered his sister\u2019s existence, she would have known nothing of his; but in the late 1980s, after her adoptive mother\u2019s death, she found out her history and traced her birth mother. Ann was reunited with Lynn, the daughter she had given away, and today she and David are close.</p> <p>One thing that comes through in the documentary is the family\u2019s resilience: David credits his mother for that. \u201cShe had such a positive attitude to life,\u201d he says. \u201cShe had been through a lot: her mother died when she was a child, she\u2019d had to give her baby away and then her husband was executed. But through it all, she knew she could survive. She used to call these events in her life her tragedies, but she dealt with them \u2013 she didn\u2019t become embittered in any way.\u201d</p> <p>David, meanwhile, seems to have been determined not to be defined by the actions of his father \u2013 and yet, in the end, it has shaped all he has gone on to become. He studied engineering after leaving school, but soon realised his future was in the law.</p> <p>\u201cI think what my father\u2019s story gave me was what I would call a healthy scepticism about the way government and society works, and about the need to be independent-minded,\u201d he says. While he won\u2019t own either the guilt or the glory for his father\u2019s fight against apartheid, he is clear about his father\u2019s stance. \u201cWe all like to think we would do the right thing,\u201d says David. \u201cBut the fact is that most white South Africans were at best passive beneficiaries of apartheid.\u201d</p> <p>Whatever else he was, John Harris, who went to his execution singing We Shall Overcome, was not one of those.</p> <p><em>\u2022 The Good Terrorist will be shown on Channel 4 at 8pm on 27 August </em></p> <p><em>This article was amended on 15 August 2016 to correct some personal details</em></p>",

I just want to put all the pieces together, go and rest up and come back tomorrow stronger.\u201d</p> <p>No British track-and-field woman has won back-to-back Olympic titles, while only two in history have had a baby and retained an Olympic title over a four-year cycle: the Australian hurdler Shirley Strickland and the Cameroonian triple-jumper Fran\u00e7oise Mbango Etone. But Ennis-Hill, who gave birth to her son Reggie in 2014, has been determined to join these two unique clubs.</p> <p>Johnson-Thompson was the first of the major contenders to appear in the 100m hurdles, in the penultimate heat, and produced a solid time of 13.48 sec. It wasn\u2019t quite as quick as her performance at the world championships in Beijing last year, but it was good enough to score 1053 points.</p> <p>Then it was Ennis-Hill\u2019s turn. Outside her was the Canadian world number one, Brianne Thiesen-Eaton. Both looked nervous: Ennis-Hill slapped her hamstrings and shook her shoulders, trying to release the tension, Thiesen-Eaton managing only the thinnest of smiles. But when the gun went off, Ennis-Hill was out of the blocks fastest and over the hurdles smoothest, coming through to win in 12.84 sec. It wasn\u2019t quite a season\u2019s best \u2013 she had run 0.08 sec faster at the Anniversary Games last month \u2013 and it was 0.30 sec slower than her time when she won gold at London 2012 but the 30-year-old from Sheffield was happy to take the time and the lead with a points score of 1149. Thiesen-Eaton, meanwhile, was sixth in 1,097.</p> <p>Enni-Hill then cleared 1.89m in the high jump \u2013 her best since the UK indoor trials of February 2012. But Johnson-Thompson kept the pressure on as she recovered from a so-so hurdles to make a series of first-time clearances than culminated in a brilliant personal best of 1.98m in high jump \u2013 a height equalled by Thiam.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"12597088cc05e8cc1634a5e748cfc25d65ba7b22\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/12597088cc05e8cc1634a5e748cfc25d65ba7b22/0_183_4152_2490/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Katarina Johnson-Thompson in the shot put.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Katarina Johnson-Thompson in the shot put.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Cameron Spencer/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It meant that after two events Johnson-Thompson led with 2,264 with Ennis-Hill just behind on 2,242. Akela Jones from Barbados was third on 2178, with Theisen-Eaton fourth on 2151.</p> <p>However the third event of the day, the shot put was to prove a disaster for Johnson-Thompson. Her first throw was so poor that it barely went 10m, although it didn\u2019t count because she stepped out of the circle. Her second was a little better, at 11.68m, but her third effort was disastrous by her stands at 11.19m. It left her with a score of just 640 points from the event and slipped to sixth on 2904 points.</p> <p>Ennis-Hill has been throwing 14.50m in training but was frustrated after failing to reproduce that form. After only managing 13.86m \u2013 nearly a metre down on her personal best \u2013 she had her head in her hands. Still, it at least scored her 785 points which moved her up to second on 3,027 points behind Thiam, whose excellent competition continued with a throw of 14.91m, the best of the competition to take her to 3107 points.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/13/the-athletics-elite-turns-up-on-time-but-rio-seems-still-to-be-in-bed\">The athletics elite turns up on time but Rio seems still to be in bed</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The two British women were one and two in the final event of day one, the 200m, with Johnson-Thompson winning in 23.26 sec to score 1053 points.
