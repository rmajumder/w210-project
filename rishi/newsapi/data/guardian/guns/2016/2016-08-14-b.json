  "<p>A lot done, more to do. Mark Cavendish goes into the final three events of the chaotic carnival of wacky races that is the omnium in the bronze-medal position but was left thumping his handlebars in frustration after an error in the elimination race that could prove extremely costly when it comes to deciding the podium placings.</p> <p>After a few days of reports chronicling his conspicuous non-appearances at the velodrome, there were sarcastic sighs of relief when Cavendish finally turned up. Having failed to win a medal at Beijing 2008 or London 2012, he was an unused reserve on the victorious Team GB pursuit team here so his quest continues. Not getting any younger, the 31-year-old has previously hinted this will be his last tilt at the Olympics. \u201cIf it\u2019s not meant to be, it\u2019s not meant to be,\u201d he recently mused.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2016/aug/14/rio-olympics-2016-remarkable-farah-retains-crown-as-phelps-signs-off-with-another-gold-live\">Rio Olympics 2016: Whitlock, Kenny and Rose win gold for GB, cycling and more \u2013 live!</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The cycling equivalent of a heptathlon, the omnium is a multi-discipline event staged over two days and was introduced to the Olympics in London four years ago. Competitors ride in six events \u2013 a 15-kilometre scratch race, a four-kilometre individual pursuit, an elimination race, a one-kilometre time trial, flying lap and 40-kilometre points race \u2013 all of which must be completed. Points are awarded at the conclusion of each event and whoever gets the most points wins. If it sounds complicated, that is because it is but since the velodrome opened its doors last week no other event has kicked off to a louder cheer. Quite simply the omnium is tremendous fun.</p> <p>Cavendish was one of 18 riders to line up for the day\u2019s first event, the scratch race. The track equivalent of a Grand Tour stage, it is a long and cagey affair in which cyclists race over 15 kilometres. Theoretically, sprinters such as Cavendish might collaborate to keep the bunch together, while those more equipped for endurance riding attempt to maximise their chances of winning by going on energy-sapping and occasionally suicidal breakaways. Having survived what appeared to be a serious speed wobble on lap 32 of 60, Cavendish finished a reasonably respectable sixth in a race won by the defending champion, Lasse Hansen, from Denmark.</p> <p>His performance in the individual pursuit was little short of sensational, catapulting him into second place overall and serious medal contention after two events. Starting on the opposite side of the track from Fernando Gaviria, he put in a shift over the 4,000 metres, chasing the world champion down and overtaking him. It was not quite good enough and he finished second in the event after another imperious performance from a great Dane who would later come a surprising cropper.</p> <p>Once known by its vastly superior name Devil Take The Hindmost, the elimination race is unquestionably the pick of the events and the speciality of the reigning world and Olympic women\u2019s omnium champion, Laura Trott. A game of cycling musical chairs, the field pedal their way round the track and the one in last place at the end of every second lap is eliminated until only one remains. Riders to the fore of the bunch control the pace to keep themselves safe, while stragglers must time their sprints to perfection to avoid being eliminated at the pivotal moments.</p> <p>Astonishingly Hansen was first man out, finding himself at the back with nowhere to go after 500 metres. Spotting an opportunity to riff on his angry rival\u2019s very apparent pain, Cavendish looked to capitalise and seemed in no danger as, one by one, nine more rivals came a cropper in the following laps.</p> <p>With a high finish and the overall lead there for the taking, disaster struck and he was next to go, in circumstances that left him seething. Swooping down the banking to take an inside line and avoid elimination, he ran into traffic and briefly strayed out of bounds on to the blue band bordering the track referred to as the Cote d\u2019Azur. Spotted by the judges, the lights on his handlebars were duly illuminated and he peeled off the bunch in a fury.</p> <p>In the day\u2019s other event, the women\u2019s sprint, Becky James and Katy Marchant qualified first and second for the competition proper, with James setting an Olympic record with her flying 200 metres. The duo\u2019s high placings earned them an easier route through subsequent rounds and their progress to the last eight was duly serene. Their competition continues on Monday before concluding the following day.</p>",
  "<p>Teachers awaiting <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/alevels\">A-level results</a> on Thursday are bracing themselves for turbulence as the impact of sweeping changes to the curriculum begin to be felt.</p> <p>For the past year, schools have been getting to grips with a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2015/jan/16/ucas-warns-students-disadvantaged-a-level-reforms\">new curriculum</a> in a wide range of subjects at AS-level \u2013 taken at the end of the first year of sixth form \u2013 while continuing to teach the old curriculum to year 13s.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s been a very stressful year,\u201d said Julia Neal, manager of a sixth form in a high-achieving school in the West Country. \u201cAll these changes come thick and fast.

As a result, we expect this summer\u2019s changes to AS-levels will mean that individual school or college results will be more variable than in recent years.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/aug/10/getting-your-a-levels-next-week-share-your-stories-with-us\">Getting your A-Levels next week?

Mike Nicholson, head of student recruitment and admissions at Bath University and a member of the AQA exam board council of trustees, said: \u201cFor teachers in England there\u2019s an awful lot of change with a whole range of new qualifications. I would expect some turbulence.</p> <p>\u201cThere are enormous pressures on schools, finishing off A-levels with the current year 13, while worrying about new A-levels and new GCSEs. You are spreading yourself thinner as a teacher and there may be some consequences.\u201d</p> <p>There is an additional layer of uncertainty as students who sat exams this summer will find it harder to successfully <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/may/26/gcse-a-level-exam-appeals-remarks-change-tougher-challenge-results\">appeal</a> against results following changes to the rules governing exam re-marks and appeals.</p> <p>In recent years there has been a sharp increase in the number of requests for re-marks and <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/changes-to-enquiries-and-appeals\">Ofqual</a> believes too many students have been getting extra marks, and possibly a higher grade, when the original mark was \u201cperfectly appropriate\u201d.</p> <p>Geoff Barton, headteacher of King Edward VI school, a Church of England comprehensive in Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk, said: \u201cI\u2019ve been an English teacher since 1985. I used to know what a C in English looked like and a grade A. Now it feels as if someone somewhere, in an obscure back office, makes the decision.<br></p> <p> \u201cThis year the new uncertainty is what the decoupling of AS- and A-levels might mean for schools and colleges. It\u2019s all deeply confusing and concerning, and another reason that so many of us resent the unleashing of a volley of reforms without the time to explore the consequences on students, teachers and schools.\u201d</p> <p>For those students, however, who are hoping to secure a place at university this week, it is a \u201cbuyers\u2019 market\u201d, with competition mounting between higher education institutions around the UK to fill a growing number of places.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/aug/13/uk-universities-take-increasing-battle-for-students-into-virtual-world\">UK universities take increasing battle for students into virtual world</a> </p> </aside>  <p>School leavers are in a stronger position than ever before as they make their choices. Because of the prevailing demographic, there are fewer 18-year-olds at a time when the cap on numbers has been lifted in universities, who are now free to recruit as many students as they wish.</p> <p>As a result, school leavers are being lured by universities offering a variety of \u201cfreebies\u201d, ranging from free postgraduate study in a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/shortcuts/2016/aug/08/buy-one-get-one-free-degrees-higher-education-discount-pricing\">buy-one-get-one-free (bogof) degree deal</a>, free iPads, \u201cmoney cards\u201d with \u00a3300 credit, free books, scholarships and free gym membership.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a buyers\u2019 market,\u201d said Nick Hillman, director of the <a href=\"http://www.hepi.ac.uk/\">Higher Education Policy Institute</a>. \u201cThe point of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/higher-education-network/blog/2014/sep/18/removing-cap-student-numbers-six-questions-hepi-report\">removing student number controls</a> was to make a more competitive environment.

Until it comes to registration we won\u2019t know for sure.\u201d<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p> Paul Teulon, director of admissions at King\u2019s College London, added: \u201cFor this summer, I think we\u2019re in a relatively sound position. I think the challenge will come when we start to see application numbers in October, November, December the following year. That will depend on what the government is able to confirm in that interim period.\u201d</p> <p>This year is also likely to confirm a growing trend in unconditional offers, where universities offer a place regardless of results. There were 12,100 such offers in 2014 and almost double that in 2015 (23,400) \u2013 the trend is, however, deeply unpopular with schools, which fear students may sit back and underperform at A-level.</p> <p>\u201cAll of us are concerned about the demographics, with fewer 18-year-olds in the population,\u201d said Hopkins, \u201cso, as we have been saying over the past couple of years, we think it\u2019s going to be more competitive than ever.<br></p> <p> \u201cBut it\u2019s a good time to be an applicant because there are more opportunities and chances than there have ever been. And because of that I think there will be a lot of opportunities in clearing as well and adjustment, so if people want to make a late decision or a late change they\u2019ll be able to.\u201d</p> <p> The University of Sheffield was last week reported to be offering buy-one-get-one-free degrees in a deal that guaranteed free postgraduate study after signing up to an undergraduate course. \u201cIt was slightly misreported, it\u2019s not an incentive at this time of year, it\u2019s a scholarship programme that runs alongside the main application cycle,\u201d said Hopkins.</p> <p> \u201cIt\u2019s simply trying to find inventive ways to help students who are going to have considerable debts, financial debts, thinking about further study.\u201d</p>",

  "<p>Private law firms will be hired by police to pursue criminal suspects for profit, under a radical new scheme to target cyber criminals and fraudsters.<br></p> <p>In a pilot project by the City of London police, the lead force on fraud in England and Wales, officers will pass details of suspects and cases to law firms, which will use civil courts to seize the money.</p> <p>The force says the scheme is a way of more effectively tackling fraud \u2013 which is now the biggest type of crime, estimated to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2016/jul/30/online-fraud-crime-theft-bank-account\">cost \u00a3193bn a year</a>.

If unsuccessful, police could decide to leave it at that or pursue the case themselves through the criminal courts. </p> <p>Commander Chris Greany, head of economic crime at City of London police, said: \u201cIt is a huge shift \u2026 Civil recovery allows us to get hold of a criminal\u2019s money sooner, and repay back victims sooner.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"edb38cd33217e1a28b676a5d05354018d185b8a2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/edb38cd33217e1a28b676a5d05354018d185b8a2/0_0_3500_2300/1000.jpg\" alt=\"City of London police officers will pass details of suspects to law firms.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"657\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">City of London police officers will pass details of suspects to law firms.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dominic Lipinski/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>One prominent criminal law firm was sceptical about the plans, expressing concern that a profit motive could damage the fairness of the process. </p> <p>Currently, police pursue people suspected of making millions through financial crimes by prosecuting them in the criminal courts, and need to prove their case beyond reasonable doubt. After conviction, a lengthy process starts to seize the proceeds of crime, which can take years. Police believe some suspects use the delay to hide their assets.</p> <p>Under the shakeup being piloted, a law firm will pursue the suspect in the civil courts before any conviction and possibly even without a criminal charge. The burden of proof is lower in civil courts, and they will only have to show that the suspect stole the money on the balance of probabilities.</p> <p>Katie Wheatley, joint head of criminal law at Bindmans, a London law firm, expressed unease over the proposals, which she said gave police \u201cwhat they would regard as an easy deterrent, without having the inconvenience of proving an offence to a criminal standard\u201d.</p> <p>Greany said the law firm and others in the private sector would bear the risk, in return for a share of the money taken off the criminal suspect. </p> <p>The lead law firm taking part in the pilot is Mischon de Reya, best known for representing Princess Diana in her divorce from Prince Charles.</p> <p>Greany said: \u201cWho benefits from this? The victim will benefit, because they will get their money back. We\u2019ll benefit because the criminal will be skint and they will be brought back down to having nothing again, and have to get about their normal lives, and they won\u2019t have status in the community.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>What evidence would they be using to strip somebody of their assets?</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Money from fraud is being hidden around the world and getting a conviction and then seizing the assets of criminals can be very complex and lengthy. Greany said: \u201cYou can destabilise a criminal gang much faster by taking their asset off them [rather] than chasing them around the world for five years.\u201d</p> <p>But Wheatley asked of the police: \u201cWhat evidence would they be using to strip somebody of their assets? If a criminal prosecution has failed, well OK, the burden of proof is slightly different, but you still have to wonder whether evidence that has been rejected by a criminal court ought to be the first port of call for a civil forfeiture or a civil confiscation order.\u201d</p> <p>Wheatley said the plan risked creating a conflict between private firms\u2019 profit motive and the fairness of the process. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen privatisation in this context in other ways, for example prison privatisation,\u201d she said. \u201cWe all know how badly that\u2019s gone wrong, particularly for young offenders. I appreciate they are not talking about convictions or detentions, but having possibly life savings, large assets stripped from you is a life-changing event. Whereas for the companies that the role was subcontracted to, it would just be a job.\u201d</p> <p>Robert Wynn Jones, a specialist in fraud at Mishcon de Reya, said the \u201cnovel and pragmatic\u201d scheme would boost the deterrent to criminals. Wynn Jones said victims might be asked to pay legal costs, or specialist insurers could fund the fees in return for a 20-30% share of the money taken off criminals.</p> <p>He said it would have to be financially worthwhile, meaning the scheme would only work for cases where losses ran into the hundreds of thousands. The use of private investigators would push up the cost.</p> <p>There are two main downsides. If the suspect appeals and wins, or is cleared in a criminal case, then the money seized has to be repaid with interest added.</p> <p>The second controversial aspect is the transfer of what was essentially punishment carried out through the state system, with established methods of accountability, to private firms, where it would be done for profit.

  "<p>A week ago, Kim Brennan\u2019s Olympic dream very nearly went up the spout. In one of the most extraordinary settings in world sport and in one of the most demanding Olympic events \u2013 an event she has dominated for several years and pretty much dedicated her entire adult life to \u2013 her boat came perilously close to sinking. </p> <p>The most meticulous and diligent of athletes, even Brennan had not anticipated the crosswinds and wild chop of Lagoa Stadium. White-capped waves crashed into her boat, which quickly filled with water. At one stage, she was wobbling all over the place in fourth, but rallied to finish third behind an unknown Mexican and Zimbabwean. \u201cUn-rowable,\u201d she later labelled the course. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/14/australias-kim-brennan-wins-gold-in-rowing-as-meares-takes-keirin-bronze\">Australia's Kim Brennan wins gold in rowing as Meares takes keirin bronze</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cOne of the traits that rowers share is a stubborn determination to persist,\u201d Brennan told Guardian Australia in the lead up to the Games. \u201cOurs is a sport where you will get injured and you will get sick and your body will constantly be on edge. It\u2019s a sport where so much can go wrong. And the ones who end up doing well are the ones who can get up when things go horribly wrong.\u201d<br><br>Rowing 2,000m demands a fuller suite of skills \u2013 power, endurance, technical precision and core, lower and upper body strength \u2013 than almost any other Olympic sport. Because it\u2019s non-impact, rowers are capable of astonishing workloads and in full flight Brennan trained up to eight hours a day \u2013 on a freezing Canberra lake, in the gym, in the pool, on her bike and in the pilates studio. Sunday was her day off, which she spent working as a lawyer.</p> <p>If you\u2019ve ever watched a rower at the end of an Olympic final, or even just some poor sap on the ergometer at your local gym, the sport seems unusually arduous. It\u2019s the ultimate physical lie detector. Most gold medallists struggle to raise an arm in celebration. \u201cIt\u2019s a bit crazy in some ways,\u201d she says. \u201cIn any rowing race, after 250m, you could quite happily stop there. You\u2019re an eighth of the way through and you feel like there\u2019s no way you can keep going. Some enjoy that feeling, some struggle with it. But it\u2019s not actually \u2018pain\u2019. It\u2019s actually an intense discomfort of your mind and your body saying \u2018I don\u2019t want to do this\u2019. Your eyes fail you. You can\u2019t see anything anymore. It\u2019s grey, it\u2019s black, it\u2019s speckled. Your body\u2019s not doing what you tell it to do. It\u2019s actually shutting down.\u201d</p> <p>Her\u2019s has been an atypical and occasionally rocky path to Olympic gold. Unlike most rowers, who learn in the private school system, Brennan stumbled into the sport as a 20-year-old hobbled ex runner. Like so many newcomers, she regularly fell into Melbourne\u2019s fetid Yarra River. She endued the indignities of the Crawford Report, and the bureaucratic gordian knot that followed, as she and many other elite athletes struggled to make a living. Becoming a single sculler, she had to quickly master a new discipline. In London, she thought her boat was going to sink at the start line. Four years earlier, she had missed a medal in the women\u2019s pairs and briefly considered packing it in, moving back to Melbourne and pursuing a career in the law. </p> <p>\u201cI was pretty devastated,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd at the time it was also pretty confusing. I didn\u2019t have the experience to put it into context and understand what had gone wrong. I\u2019d trained as hard as I could possibly train, I\u2019d done everything that was asked of me. And I couldn\u2019t understand why that resulted in such a poor performance. You start thinking, \u2018is that all I\u2019m capable of?\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"31940c5cfea837b7149a98ab6a026afac24977b2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/31940c5cfea837b7149a98ab6a026afac24977b2/0_0_4096_2727/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Kim Brennan\" width=\"1000\" height=\"666\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Kim Brennan poses with her gold medal after winning the single sculls competition in Rio.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Lukas Coch/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In Rio, if conditions had worsened and the quarter-final had been cancelled, that would have been curtains. But on her 31st birthday, on calm waters, she brained them. Fast forward to Saturday and she sat on the start line, pondering Christ the Redeemer. It was a far cry from the the icy, poo-stained pontoons of Canberra\u2019s Lake Burley Griffin, where she does the bulk of her training.</p> <p>\u201cIn every big event, I get nervous,\u201d she says. \u201cBut I\u2019ve learned to embrace the joy in that \u2013 that feeling of your stomach in knots. And I always have this moment of calm where I think \u2018Oh well, I\u2019ve done as much as I can do, I\u2019ve trained as hard as I can train, all I can do is make the next stroke better than the one before.</p> <p>\u201cWhen I\u2019m racing well, there\u2019s almost an emptiness. No distractions, no fears, just faith in your training and your body. It\u2019s my time.\u201d And the Olympic final was her time. Her main rival, New Zealand\u2019s Emma Twigg, was never really a factor. After a few hundred metres, Brennan had a boat length on her nearest competitor. In a race she describes as \u201ca blur\u201d, she won comfortably. In many ways, her gold medal was won earlier in the week, when she kept her cool and avoided capsizing. <br><br>Afterwards, she immediately thanked all the people who helped her to the start line. She singled out her husband, Scott Brennan, the last Australian to win an Olympic rowing gold medal. She dedicated her win to former team-mate Sarah Tait, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/mar/03/australian-olympic-rower-sarah-tait-dies-aged-33\">who died this year from cervical cancer</a>. She mentioned how the life of an Olympian is actually quite a selfish one, with partners, families, social lives and careers all put on hold. She hinted this would be the perfect way to bow out, having achieved what she\u2019s been dreaming about since, as a seven-year-old, she watched a Paralympic archer fire an arrow to light the cauldron in Barcelona.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s this common perception that to be good at top level sport you have to be totally obnoxious,\u201d Brennan says. \u201cThere\u2019s this perception that we\u2019re living this luxury lifestyle sponging off the taxpayer. I\u2019m not making money as a sportsperson but I do have the luxury of being able to combine the sport I love with a career. But the idea that if you win an Olympic gold medal that you\u2019ll be rolling in money couldn\u2019t be further from the truth. I\u2019ve got no interest in having my face on the side of a bus, putting my name to a company I don\u2019t believe in.\u201d</p> <p>In an Olympic Games suffused with cynicism, Brennan\u2019s win was the perfect tonic. At the risk of sounding twee, it\u2019s hard to think of anyone who better embodies what the Olympics are actually supposed to be about. It\u2019s hard to think of an athlete who trained harder and who kept a clearer head. It\u2019s hard to think of anyone who deserves this gold medal more.</p>",

I have warned repeatedly, though, about the dangers of solar observation. To look directly at the Sun through an unprotected telescope or binoculars is to guarantee serious eye damage.</p> <p>The traditional method of solar observation is to project the Sun\u2019s image through binoculars or a small telescope onto a white card held away from the eyepiece. However, I now recommend the use of inexpensive but accredited solar filters that cover the objective (Sun-facing) end of the telescope and block 99.999% of the Sun\u2019s radiation. Provided these are fitted securely, with no light-gaps, holes or scratches, they provide a safe viewing experience and a better image than is usual by projection.</p> <p>Sunspots, the most obvious features we see, are regions that form when the Sun\u2019s magnetic flux inhibits the heat flowing from below so that they cool below the 5,780K (5,507C) of the remainder of the Sun\u2019s visible surface, the photosphere. A spot can last for a day or two, or up to a month or more, and they often occur in groups, drifting east to west across the Sun as it rotates every 26 days as seen from the Earth.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2013/may/17/spacewatch-solar-flares-sunspots\">Spacewatch: Solar maximum</a> </p> </aside>  <p>One useful index of the level of solar activity is provided by the so-called sunspot number. It is based on the sum of the number of separate spots and ten times the number of groups and, after making allowance for different observers and their telescopes, it lets us trace activity back almost continuously through several centuries.</p> <p>Our graph plots a rolling average of the mean sunspot numbers since 1955 and illustrates the solar cycle of about 11 years. The highest sunspot numbers on record occurred around the sunspot maximum of 1958 while the latest cycle began in 2008 and is the lowest since one that peaked in 1906.</p> <p>As with several recent cycles, the current one shows a double peak, in 2012 and 2014, but is now certainly in decline towards the next sunspot minimum in perhaps 2020. Our image is from 21 July and shows the most recent sizeable sunspots before they disappeared around the Sun\u2019s edge three days later. There has been at least one spotless day since, and already more this year than since 2010.</p> <p></p>",

This is, to put things mildly, not a good thing. It was one thing for Team USA to play a close game against an Australian team that many thought would give them a challenge. It\u2019s their effort <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/12/olympic-basketball-usa-serbia-report\">against Serbia</a> in the very next game that was more worrisome. Serbia was a missed (wide open) three pointer away from inexplicably forcing overtime, something which should shock some sense into this motley collection of NBA stars (and also Harrison Barnes).</p> <p>These two back-to-back games are the closest thing the US team has had to a struggle since the disaster that was the 2004 Olympics. Yes, it\u2019s only group play, but Team USA doesn\u2019t quite look like the unstoppable juggernaut that hey really should be. This is a team that can be beat and if that seems entirely out of the realm of possibility, well we all saw what happened to the US women\u2019s football team on Friday. </p> <p>So there\u2019s really only two possibilities for how today\u2019s game against France\u2019s national team will play out: France will either exploit the US team\u2019s struggles or they will be utterly demolished by a US team desperate to prove themselves before the elimination games start. <br></p> <p>The positive thing for France, who have <a href=\"http://www.nbcolympics.com/news/france-presents-big-test-team-usa-knockout-round\">already secured a spot</a> in the quarterfinals, is that they have legit NBA talent on their roster. The San Antonio Spurs\u2019 Tony Parker leads a group of players that includes the Utah Jazz\u2019s Rudy \u201cThe Stifle Tower\u201d Gobert, the Charlotte Hornets\u2019 Nicholas Batum and teammate Boris Diaw and former teammate Nando de Colo.</p> <p>So it could be an interesting game.

  "<p>While it is true that in the mid-1960s Labour\u2019s youth movement massively declined (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/aug/11/tom-watsons-portrayal-of-new-labour-members-is-not-one-we-recognise\">Letters</a>, 12 August), the Labour Party Young Socialists grew dramatically in the 1970s and 1980s when it was led by supporters of Militant who had become its leadership in 1970. This revival came from a combination of increasing class struggle, radicalisation in society and serious campaigning. Soon nearly 2,000 young people were attending the LPYS\u2019s annual conferences. This growth continued and the LPYS reached a high point of 581 branches in 1985, the time of the miners\u2019 strike, youth protests against Thatcher etc.</p> <p>However, the growing offensive against the left by the pro-capitalist wing of the Labour party inevitably had a damaging impact on the LPYS. As it became clear that expulsions of individuals would not tame the LPYS the Labour party right wing resorted to rule changes. In 1987 the LPYS\u2019s age limit was cut from 26 to 23 and most of its democratic structures were removed, with the result that by 1990 it only had 52 branches left, a reduction of 90% in five years. Tom Watson, then the Labour party\u2019s youth officer, presided over the LPYS\u2019s final liquidation and its replacement by Young Labour, an organisation without fully democratic structures and controlled by the party leadership. Watson\u2019s support now for limiting the franchise for Labour\u2019s leadership election shows his preference for top-down methods when he and his supporters cannot build grassroots support.<br><strong>Bob Labi</strong><br><em>Editor of Left, the LPYS paper, between 1971 and 1977</em></p> <p>\u2022 I became a Trotskyist after leaving grammar school but have continued to share the values and perspective of the socialist pioneer. I remain committed to the abolition of all grammar schools too. In 1974 I joined the local Labour party on the very day Ted Heath called a general election. I have remained a party member and avowedly a Trotskyist. During 42 years\u2019 Labour party membership I have been (inter alia) constituency secretary, and ward political activities officer. I served eight years as a Camden councillor (for some time as deputy leader) and for 11 years as an elected member of the Inner London Education Authority (for three years as leader).</p> <p>Over the years I have never wavered in my belief that international socialism is crucial if the people are to take power away from the wealthy, the global corporations and the corrupt bigots who hate workers, the poor and the disadvantaged. Trotsky remains an inspiration. He detested Stalin and his violent abuse of state power; he was as a result murdered by a Stalinist assassin; he loved literature and was a believer in its power to elevate culture above social elitism. Trotsky wrote that the \u201cmoral grandeur of the proletarian revolution consists in the fact that it is laying the foundations of a culture which is above classes and which will be the first culture which is truly human\u201d (Introduction to Literature and Revolution). Not bad, eh? He was probably a Guardian reader too.<br><strong>Neil Fletcher</strong><br><em>London</em></p> <p>\u2022 The co-founder of Militant, Peter Taaffe, displays the usual disposition of the authoritarian left: the need to completely rewrite history (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/aug/10/leader-expelled-leftwing-group-militant-peter-taaffe-readmission-labour-corbyn\">Report</a>, 11 August). His claims that the Militant Tendency \u201cfought Thatcher in Liverpool and defeated her\u201d are ludicrous. A Militant-led Labour party came to power in Liverpool in 1983 with a relatively progressive social programme. I remember, however, a tactical ineptness with, among other idiocies, the issuing of redundancy notices to 30,000 Liverpool city council workers resulting in mass anti-Militant protests by these workers in defence of their jobs; and the setting of an illegal budget that Militant then backtracked on by going cap in hand to the Thatcher government for permission to obtain a large loan in order to set a subsequent legal budget. In 1985, the illegal budget resulted in the barring from office and surcharge of 47 Labour councillors to the tune of \u00a3348,000 which I and many other trade unionists had to help pay through donations.</p> <p>The Thatcher government set Militant one trap after another which it blindly blundered into with all the tactical nous of a horny bull elephant in must. Far from being defeated by Militant, the Thatcher government had Militant on a string. Its legacy was also disastrous. In fact, you could attribute Labour\u2019s loss of overall control in Liverpool from 1992 onwards and 12 wasted years of Liberal control from 1998 to 2010 in part to Militant\u2019s inept period in power. The fantasy version of history is Peter Taffe\u2019s but the reality is that the Thatcher government roundly defeated Militant in Liverpool.<br><strong>John Hoggart </strong><br><em>Little Neston, Cheshire</em></p> <p>\u2022 Re <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/aug/12/corbyns-team-incensed-as-new-members-denied-labour-vote-again\">New members denied Labour vote again</a> (13 August) and Lord Justice Sales, would this be the same Philip Sales who in 1997 was recruited by Tony Blair from his own chambers, 11KBW, causing something of a storm over accusations of cronyism?

  "<p>The Housing and Planning Act is due to return to parliament after the summer recess. This will provide a second chance for our politicians to demand the government think again about this ill-conceived, damaging, divisive and unworkable legislation. We are deeply concerned the act will make the housing&#xa0;crisis worse. The Chartered Institute of Housing has warned that 350,000 social rented homes could be lost. Council and housing association tenants would suffer massive rent rises, a tenants\u2019 tax that penalises those on moderate incomes. New tenants, some of them vulnerable, could be denied the security of a permanent home.</p> <p>Family life will suffer as people are priced out of their neighbourhoods and the vital networks that nurture community cohesion are strained to breaking point. The government argues that new \u201caffordable\u201d housing will be provided by so-called \u201cstarter homes\u201d, costing up to \u00a3450,000, but these will be unaffordable to many of those who are now consigned to the exorbitant private rented sector which the act does little to tame.</p> <p>We need a Housing Act that meets the needs of millions, not only the few, and offers a genuinely sustainable alternative to the endemic uncertainty of the housing market.

After more than a decade of falling murder and mugging rates, numbers have increased over the past two years. In the run-up to the Games, there were several incidents. Among the most prominent were Australian paralympics athlete Liesl Tesch and her training partner Sarah Ross, who had their bicycles stolen at gunpoint while on a training ride in the Aterro do Flamengo public park. Three Spanish Olympic sailors were robbed at gunpoint in May, while a shooting competitor lost her equipment in a theft in June.</p> <p>During the first week of the Games, there were several high-profile cases. A mugger was shot and killed when he tried to rob the chief of security at the opening ceremony. Another case involved a confrontation with a judo wrestler on Copacabana beach. Outside the Olympic venues, the huge security presence \u2013 22,000 soldiers have been deployed in addition to more than 60,000-plus police \u2013 has led to heightened tensions in some areas.</p> <p>On Wednesday a state trooper was shot \u2013 and subsequently died of his wounds \u2013 after he mistakenly drove into a favela controlled by drug traffickers. In the subsequent hunt for his killers, several residents have been killed or injured.</p> <p>Police \u2013 or people dressing up as police \u2013 often appear to be the perpetrators of crime. Last month, a New Zealand jiu-jitsu martial arts expert Jason Lee was abducted and robbed by two military police, who initially claimed they were fining him for not carrying his passport. He lodged a complaint and was subsequently so concerned about his safety that he left the country. According to Amnesty, Rio\u2019s police killed 1,519 people in the five years up to August 2015 \u2013 almost one in six killings in the city.</p>",
  "<p>There will be greater challenges to come for Warrington this year \u2013 one before August is even over. To that end, this was a priceless victory which moved them above Wigan and just a point shy of Hull FC at the top of Super League but, with a Wembley final against Hull just two weeks away, this was anything but the Warrington side their fans have come to expect this year.</p> <p>The record books will show that both of this year\u2019s Challenge Cup finalists won this weekend \u2013 both scoring 38 points in the process too \u2013 but that is where the similarities end. For the league leaders Hull it was a thoroughly <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/11/widnes-hull-fc-super-league-match-report\" title=\"\">polished performance to see off Widnes,</a> but in contrast, Warrington were far more erratic.</p> <p>Their coach, Tony Smith, described it as an OK performance but against a side who were struggling to field a 17 fit enough to play this game, let alone compete in it, it almost felt like the Wolves were holding something in reserve with Wembley on the horizon.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/11/widnes-hull-fc-super-league-match-report\">Hull FC far too good for Widnes as they stride towards semi-final</a> </p> </aside>  <p>A fortnight ago they were utterly destructive in ending Wakefield\u2019s Challenge Cup campaign, winning 56-12, but here their performance was scattered with errors and an underlying suggestion that Smith\u2019s side have several more gears to hit before the final.</p> <p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t the prettiest of games all-round,\u201d Smith said. \u201cWe played our part in that and so did Wakefield. There wasn\u2019t a huge atmosphere compared to the last time we met so it was difficult but it was important to get a win. We were ok, and I felt the game was never out of our control.\u201d</p> <p>Just like Widnes\u2019s defeat to Hull on Thursday, this loss means Wakefield\u2019s faint top-four hopes are mathematically over but again their coach, Chris Chester, stressed a longer-term vision afterwards. With another member of the club\u2019s highly-regarded academy, James Batchelor, debuting here, Chester was keen to press home the fact that with Super League status secured for 2017, the Wildcats can afford to blood some of their homegrown stars without fear of serious repercussions.</p> <p>\u201cWe didn\u2019t get beat on effort today,\u201d he said. \u201cYoung Batch is one for the future but also one for now, then there\u2019s Judah Mazive, Max Jowitt and Jordan Crowther in there too. The kids really stood up in my eyes today, with no shortage of effort.\u201d</p> <p>As they did in the semi-final at Leigh two weeks ago, Wakefield\u2019s injury-hit side \u2013 again they were without 11 \u2013 took the lead, this time when Jonny Molloy touched down following Liam Finn\u2019s clever kick. That, however, stirred Warrington into life, with tries from Ben Currie, Chris Hill and Ryan Atkins opening up a commanding lead for the Wolves at&#xa0;half-time.</p> <p>Atkins\u2019 try, when he touched down Chris Sandow\u2019s well weighted kick, made it 16-6 three minutes before half-time, a moment Chester identified as crucial. \u201cIt was a soft try to ship right on the break and it was pretty big,\u201d he said. Trinity would have their chances to get back into the contest as the second half began, but they were too wasteful in attack to seriously threaten the Wolves.</p> <p>The visitors then made them pay when Matty Russell collected a loose pass from Craig Hall to race unchallenged to the line, and although the impressive Mazive sparked hopes of a comeback with his first try for the club, they were quickly extinguished as the game entered the final quarter.</p> <p>With Wakefield pressing, tries from Daryl Clark, Russell\u2019s second and Joe Westerman put the seal on a win which could turn out to be crucial in the long run for the Wolves. Wembley is casting a rather significant shadow over everything Warrington are doing at the moment but in terms of the race for top spot, this was another big tick in the box for Smith and his men.</p> <p><strong>Wakefield</strong> Hall; Mazive, Lyne, Arundel, Jones-Bishop; Miller, Finn; Scruton, Sio, Arona, Molloy, Walton, Crowther. <strong>Interchange</strong> Jowitt, Yates, Batchelor, Fifita.</p> <p><strong>Tries</strong> Molloy, Mazive.

  "<p>J\u00fcrgen Klopp lost himself in the moment. The Liverpool manager beat his chest and, in the frenzy, he knocked his glasses from his face. Adam Lallana had just put his team 2-1 up early in the second half and, when the passions had cooled, Klopp fished around on the ground in order to reacquaint himself with his lenses.</p> <p>It was an afternoon when Klopp and everybody else inside the Emirates Stadium could rub their eyes in disbelief. Liverpool were irresistible for a golden period after the interval, which climaxed in Sadio Man\u00e9, the \u00a330m signing from Southampton, fizzing home their fourth goal. Klopp was central to the celebrations on the touchline, allowing Man\u00e9 to clamber on to his back. He would later say that he regretted that. The game was not over, even if it felt like it was.</p> <p>Liverpool were vibrant and clinical, with their other expensive new boy, Gini Wijnaldum \u2013 the \u00a323m purchase from Newcastle United \u2013 also prominent. Then, there was Philippe Coutinho who, not for the first time at this venue, was a joy to watch. He had equalised for 1-1 in first-half stoppage time with a scintillating 30-yard free-kick while he also scored his team\u2019s third goal.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2016/aug/14/arsenal-v-liverpool-premier-league-live\">Arsenal 3-4 Liverpool: Premier League \u2013 as it happened!</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It was some <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2016/aug/14/arsenal-v-liverpool-premier-league-live\" title=\"\">game to open the season</a> in north London but it was enjoyable only for Liverpool, where it feels that something is stirring. Klopp restored belief and unity last season and, after a full pre-season in which to hammer home his high-intensity methods and play the transfer market, he has talked of this as being <em>his</em> team. There were defensive glitches on display but the optimism could surge.</p> <p>For Arsenal, there was bitter frustration and the same old questions, despite a gallant attempt to bounce back off the canvas after Man\u00e9\u2019s goal for 4-1. The substitute Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain scored a fine solo goal and when Calum Chambers flicked home a header for 4-3, there could be thoughts of the crazy <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2009/apr/21/arsenal-liverpool-premier-league-andrey-arshavin\" title=\"\">4-4 draw between the teams at Anfield in 2009</a>.</p> <p>An Arsenal equaliser, however, never looked like materialising and, instead, there was the familiar sound of a chorus of boos from the home crowd at full-time. Ars\u00e8ne Wenger had been without seven players because of fitness issues and his makeshift central-defensive pairing of Chambers and Rob Holding, the new signing from Bolton Wanderers, was left exposed, although he did not blame them.</p> <p>Arsenal started brightly and they were the better team in a first half during which Theo Walcott missed a penalty and then scored the opening goal. But it was shocking to see how sharply the tide turned and, yet again, there could be questions about the team\u2019s mental fortitude.</p> <p>Wenger lamented the timing of Coutinho\u2019s equaliser while he also referenced the lack of experience in his team and how, physically, they had not been ready, which felt like an indictment. He can now count another couple of injuries, after Alex Iwobi and Aaron Ramsey were forced off with muscular problems around the hour and there will surely be renewed calls for Wenger to reinforce the squad with one or more signings.</p> <p>Wenger had chosen to leave his one big-money purchase, Granit Xhaka, on the substitutes\u2019 bench until the 67th minute while his decision to start Walcott ahead of Oxlade-Chamberlain on the right had been another surprise. Walcott showed his character to fashion the breakthrough, because the penalty miss had come moments earlier. From Iwobi\u2019s pass, his instincts took over and the low finish flashed into the far corner.</p> <p>Klopp would complain about the penalty award, claiming Alberto Moreno played the ball rather than Walcott but it did not matter when Simon Mignolet went the right way to beat away the kick. Moreno\u2019s challenge was clumsy, at the very least. It was the first penalty Walcott had taken in 10-and-a-half years as an Arsenal player.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/aug/14/bournemouth-manchester-united-premier-league-match-report\">Zlatan Ibrahimovic puts seal on Manchester United win at Bournemouth</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Liverpool allowed Arsenal too much space in the first half and, apart from the 40th-minute counter, when Roberto Firmino and Coutinho worked a shooting opportunity for Wijnaldum, which Petr Cech kept out, they had not hinted at an equaliser. Coutinho\u2019s execution was a \u201cgenius\u201d moment, according to Klopp. Holding had conceded the free-kick when he nibbled into the back of Coutinho.</p> <p>Ramsey had enjoyed a couple of early chances but Liverpool turned the game on its head after half-time. It felt as though they were holding an in-house competition for the goal of the month and there might have been another during that devastating spell only for Cech to save from Coutinho. Lallana could not convert the rebound.</p> <p>Lallana scored with a crisp finish after Coutinho had released Wijnaldum; the third came when Coutinho touched in Nathaniel Clyne\u2019s driven cross and Klopp was in raptures when the outstanding Man\u00e9 sliced inside to send a rising drive into the far, top corner. Coutinho was forced off on 69 minutes but Klopp reported that it was merely because of cramp. Arsenal\u2019s rally featured Oxlade-Chamberlain beating three men and embarrassing Mignolet at his near post and Chambers rising to glance home the substitute Santi Cazorla\u2019s free-kick. It was not enough.</p>",

One thing we can expect is entertainment; this fixture rarely disappoints, both teams\u2019 propensity for attacking flair and tarsal ballistics adding up to fun, fun, fun \u2013 even in last August\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/aug/24/arsenal-liverpool-premier-league-match-report\">goalless draw</a>.</p> <p>Arsenal and Liverpool collide with both sides unsure of their status in this year\u2019s Premier League pile-up. Last season, Arsenal finished second to champions that have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/aug/13/hull-leicester-city-premier-league-match-report\">retired early</a>, and have bought a very good player in an understaffed position. Granit Xhaka and young Bolton defender Rob Holding aside, Ars\u00e8ne Wenger has kept the contactless card in his pocket, and other weak spots are yet to be addressed. Holding, Calum Chambers, Nacho Monreal and Francis Coquelin are among the names in the frame to start at centre-back today, with Alexis S\u00e1nchez set to scurry around up front.</p> <p>By contrast, Liverpool\u2019s season was better in the mind\u2019s eye than it now looks on paper. A thrilling European run, and a clutch of stellar performances, only yielded two cup final defeats and an eighth-placed finish. Like Arsenal, the ultimate aim is the title, as always \u2013 but <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/aug/01/premier-league-2016-17-preview-arsenal\">the great Guardian aggregator</a>, for one, doesn\u2019t predict a top four finish <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/aug/05/premier-league-2016-2017-preview-liverpool\">for either team</a>. Unlike Arsenal, J\u00fcrgen Klopp\u2019s team have been busy in the transfer market, but headline signings Sadio Man\u00e9 and Gigi Wijnaldum are unlikely to dispel concerns that the squad remains overstuffed with good, but not great, players.</p> <p>All of which leaves us with an absurdly early big game that could go either way, where the result could set the tone for the rest of August and beyond. If they\u2019re being honest, a leisurely score draw would suit both teams nicely; history suggests that\u2019s the last thing that will happen. <strong>Kick-off is at 4pm BST</strong>; don\u2019t go anywhere.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-08-14T11:54:46.178Z\">at 12.54pm BST</time></p>  </div>",

Nick Gubbins is 71 not out and Nick Compton 28.</p> <p>Here, <strong>Lancashire</strong> scored 88 runs in the first hour and have now advanced to 391-9, with <strong>Yorkshire</strong> just pinching a third bowling point with a Tim Bresnan wicket in the 110th over. </p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57b05257e4b062ce4d223391\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-08-14T11:13:56.943Z\">12.13pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Impressive start to the day by <strong>Lancashire</strong> pair Jordan Clark and Arron Lilley, who have counter-attacked to share a 50 stand in just 35 balls and open up the possibility of five batting bonus points. </p> <p>The momentum that <strong>Yorkshire</strong> gained after tea last night is vanishing rapidly. The hosts are now 360-7 after 103 overs.<br></p> <p>No doubt, these two have had a fair amount of luck, but Lilley in particular has played strongly through the covers. <br></p> <p>Wickets have tumbled down at Trent Bridge, with <strong>Hampshire</strong>\u2019s new signing Andy Carter hurting his old county <strong>Notts</strong> by reducing them to 57-4 in reply to 319 with the wickets of Jake Ball, Rikki Wessels and Steven Mullaney in the space of 12 balls this morning. <br></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57ada96ae4b007f802bad54f\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-08-12T10:48:20.220Z\">11.48am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Preamble</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Good morning from an overcast Emirates Old Trafford.</strong> Well, what looked almost certain to be<strong> Lancashire</strong>\u2019s day yesterday on the back of Haseeb Hameed\u2019s fine 114, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/13/lancashire-yorkshire-county-championship-division-one-match-report\">turned on its head in a dramatic evening session</a>.</p> <p>Jack Brooks took three of six evening wickets to fall for 61 as <strong>Yorkshire</strong> gained the advantage, with Lancashire closing on 299-7.</p> <p>Although batting conditions looked excellent yesterday, both camps were in agreement that it wasn\u2019t just a flat road: \u201cThe wicket seems to be getting drier and the cracks wider,\u201d said Hameed, for example.</p> <p>A stat that emerged after close last night was that Hameed is the first teenaged opener to ever score three Championship centuries in a season, with the likes of Michael Vaughan, Marcus Trescothick and Rob Key all posting two.</p> <p>Elsewhere in Division One, leaders <strong>Middlesex</strong> are in total control of their clash with <strong>Durham</strong> at Lord\u2019s, and they will resume this morning on 100-1 in reply to 204 all out. Nick Compton is at the crease on 10.</p> <p>At Trent Bridge, <strong>Notts</strong> are 39-1 replying to <strong>Hampshire</strong>\u2019s 319 all out in a nicely poised relegation contest.</p> <p>Much like the Roses clash, <strong>Surrey</strong> slipped from a position of significant strength with the bat against <strong>Warwickshire</strong> yesterday. They were 110-1 and 252 all out. Jeetan Patel picked up four-for.</p> <p>Into Division Two, and leaders <strong>Essex</strong> are well placed at <strong>Derbyshire</strong>. They will begin day two on 291-4 thanks largely to Nick Browne\u2019s unbeaten 116.</p> <p>Centuries from the two Marks, Cosgrove and Pettini, led <strong>Leicestershire</strong> to 330-5 against <strong>Northants</strong> at Wantage Road, while Michael Klinger did similar for <strong>Gloucestershire</strong> at Hove as they reached 332-7 having been 34-4. <strong>Sussex</strong> can\u2019t afford to let many opportunities like that slip if they are to secure an immediate return to Division One. </p> <p>There was, however, some controversy about Klinger\u2019s ton given he had stood his ground on 29 questioning the legality of a Christian Davis catch at backward point. The umpires ruled in his favour and Sussex coach Mark Davis described it as \u201cmassively frustrating\u201d.</p> <p>Finally, fifteen wickets fell at New Road, where <strong>Worcestershire</strong> are not out of it by any stretch despite being bowled out for 163. <strong>Glamorgan </strong>are 118-5.

  "<p>Britain\u2019s 650,000 people with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2011/apr/14/bipolar-disorder-facts-symptoms\">bipolar disorder</a> should take lithium to help control their condition, despite its reputation for dulling the senses, a significant new study has found.</p> <p>Researchers claim that although the drug does carry some health risks, its overall effectiveness, especially its ability to reduce self-harm and suicide, mean it should be much more widely used.</p> <p>The findings <a href=\"http://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.1002058\">are contained in</a> the first study comparing the side-effects of the four main mood-stabilising drugs the NHS prescribes. They have prompted calls for a rethink about attitudes towards lithium, given that only an estimated 10% of those with bipolar disorder use it, mainly because patients fear it will cause loss of personality, weight gain and other problems.</p> <p>The lead author behind the research told the Guardian that widespread \u201clithium stigma\u201d among patients is leading to them receiving the wrong treatment and ending up admitted to hospital unnecessarily because their condition is not as well controlled as it could be.</p> <p>\u201cLithium is a drug with a bad reputation. It is seen by patients, and some psychiatrists, as a dangerous drug. People rightly have suspicions about it. Patients say that the downsides include emotional numbing \u2013 feeling that you aren\u2019t connected with your feelings \u2013 as well as tremors,\u201d said Dr Joseph Hayes, a psychiatrist at University College London.</p> <p>But lithium\u2019s reputation is largely misplaced and based on the experiences of patients from the 1960s to the 1980s who were given too large a dose of the drug, he added. The new research, published in the medical journal PLOS Medicine, found that the side-effects of the mood-stabilising alternatives used by most patients are either the same as or worse than lithium, Hayes said.</p> <p>The paper, co-written by Hayes and four colleagues from UCL and Oxford University, concluded that: \u201cLithium remains an important treatment for individuals with bipolar disorder.\u201d It accepts that \u201cthere is clear evidence that its use is associated with a number of adverse events.\u201d</p> <p>However, it adds: \u201cThese risks need to be offset with the potentially superior effectiveness and anti-suicidal benefits of the drug compared to other treatment options.\u201d</p> <p>The researchers studied a nationally representative sample of 6,671 patients across the UK who were treated for bipolar disorder between 1995 and 2013. Of those, 2,148 had taken lithium, 1,670 had used valproate, 1,477 had been on olanzapine and 1,376 had taken quetiapine. They experienced side-effects including chronic kidney disease, thyroid disease, weight gain and high blood pressure.</p> <p>The researchers\u2019 analysis bore out one of the two main criticisms of lithium, but found the other to be baseless. They found that patients on lithium had a higher risk of suffering kidney function problems and developing hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism and also hypercalcemia. However, none of the drugs caused more severe kidney problems.</p> <p>Meanwhile, lithium patients were less likely to put on weight than patients on the other drugs. While 15%-20% of those on the three other drugs were more likely to gain more than 15% of their body weight, just 10% of those on lithium put on the same amount of extra pounds. Those on olanzapine added the most weight and experienced high blood pressure as a result.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I think many patients are missing out quite commonly on the best available treatment</p> <footer> <cite>Dr Joseph Hayes</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Separate research has shown that patients on the other three medications are 40% more likely to harm themselves than those on lithium. Bipolar disorder carries one of the highest rates of suicide of any mental illness, alongside schizophrenia and alcohol and drug addiction.</p> <p>The very limited use of lithium is despite the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (Nice) advising in 2014 that it should be the standard treatment for bipolar disorder, which is also known as manic depression and is characterised by manic highs and bouts of depression. That superseded its previous view, outlined in 2006, that any of the four drugs were useful first lines of treatment for the condition, which affects about one in 100 people.</p> <p>\u201cLithium stigma, which includes some people in the psychiatric community, leads to people using drugs that are less effective [than lithium]. To me as a doctor that\u2019s a big worry because my main aim is to help people to be well and if you aren\u2019t doing that with the best available evidence then you are failing patients,\u201d said Hayes.</p> <p>\u201cI think that many patients are missing out quite commonly on the best available treatment. That means that people end up in hospital more often than they need to and end up achieving less in their lives than they could do if they were on lithium. The high suicide rate with bipolar disorder should encourage greater use of lithium. There should be more sensible use of it.\u201d</p> <p>Stephen Buckley, head of information at the charity Mind, said: \u201cWe welcome research which adds to our understanding of treatments and medications for people experiencing mental health problems, including bipolar disorder. But as with all areas of mental health there is still more research to be done.</p> <p>\u201cDifferent people will find that different treatments help with managing their mental health problems. This may be medication, talking therapies, or a mixture of both.\u201d</p>",

  "<p>Large shareholders in Sports Direct are considering voting against the reappointment of the company\u2019s chairman and other directors at next month\u2019s annual general meeting in a bid to force change at the top of the embattled chain.</p> <p>Keith Hellawell, who has been chairman since 2009, will be the main target at the AGM on 7 September. At last year\u2019s meeting, almost 24% of independent shareholders\u2019 votes went against him.</p> <p>After a year in which the company\u2019s reputation has been battered by the Guardian\u2019s revelations about its treatment of employees and declining financial performance, critics expect more shareholders to vote against Hellawell and other non-executive directors. </p> <p>The admission of Mike Ashley, Sports Direct\u2019s founder and majority owner, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jun/07/mike-ashleys-evidence-surprise-answers-to-unsurprising-questions\">to MPs that the company had become too big for him to control</a> has added to concerns about how the it is managed. </p> <p>A source at a large fund manager said: \u201cI can\u2019t imagine the votes will be kinder to the board than they were last year, and they could be pretty striking numbers. It\u2019s possible that the chairman could face a majority of independent shareholders voting against him based on last year\u2019s result and a stiffening of the mood.<br></p> <p>\u201cMike Ashley told the select committee he has not got proper command and oversight of the company, and everything we\u2019ve seen indicates that is a fair assessment. That is a strong indictment of every member of that board.\u201d<br></p> <p>Sports Direct\u2019s public relations advisers did not respond to a request for comment.</p> <p>New rules require minority investors to approve non-executive directors at companies where a single shareholder owns 30% or more. Ashley owns 55% of the company and is its executive deputy chairman. Sports Direct has become a test of shareholders\u2019 willingness to use the new rule to press for change. \u201cIf not now, then when?\u201d another fund management source said.</p> <p>If independent shareholders vote against Hellawell, Sports Direct can force his appointment through by holding another vote of all shareholders within 90 days. </p> <p>Large shareholders, however, also have long-running concerns. Standard Life voted against Hellawell, and other directors such as Simon Bentley, the former boss of Blacks Leisure, at last year\u2019s AGM.</p> <p>Hellawell <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/mar/02/sports-direct-chairman-defies-calls-quit-keith-hellawell\">rejected calls to quit in March</a> when Sports Direct dropped out of the FTSE 100. He said the company was working to improve relations with shareholders and that problems with its corporate governance were often overstated. <br></p> <p>As in previous years, Sports Direct will hold the AGM at its headquarters in Shirebrook, Derbyshire. The sprawling \u201ccampus\u201d is also the location for the company\u2019s giant warehouse, where <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/dec/09/sports-direct-warehouse-work-conditions\">a Guardian investigation</a> last year found that workers were effectively paid less than the minimum wage.</p> <p>Ashley has since increased pay to above the minimum wage and started his own review of working conditions, which will be assessed by Sports Direct\u2019s legal advisers RPC. The Unite trade union, however, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jul/22/unions-seek-city-support-for-review-of-sports-direct-working-conditions\">is seeking City support for a resolution</a>, opposed by Sports Direct, seeking an outside review of the treatment of employees.<br></p> <p>Large shareholders are considering adding to pressure on the board by sending representatives to the meeting. Hermes Investment Management, one of Britain\u2019s biggest fund managers, said it would send a senior official.</p> <p>Some big shareholders believe Hellawell\u2019s departure is needed for the company to show that it is serious about reforming its governance. Others said they would wait to see how negotiations turned out before deciding how to vote. </p>",
  "<p>Last week <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/live/2016/aug/08/southern-rail-strike-begins-live-updates\">Southern Rail staff went on strike</a>, leaving thousands of commuters facing a slightly improved service. Southern\u2019s non-stop calamities this summer have added support to the idea of renationalisation. This debate is something I watched with great interest. I\u2019m a standup comedian who can\u2019t drive. I have never learned. I don\u2019t trust my hand-eye coordination. You\u2019re looking at someone who once dropped a cricket ball on to his own head during a routine catching practice; I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a great idea to have me in control of a high-speed metal death robot.</p> <p>So I rely on the train system in this country. And I can tell you from firsthand experience that our train system is a mess. Carriages are full of unhappy travellers packed together like sardines, who have inexplicably paid for the privilege of being incarcerated. Periodically, everyone has to flee for cover, either by lying across the laps of the passengers lucky enough to have a seat, or by climbing into the luggage racks on the ceiling to allow the optimistically named \u201cbuffet\u201d cart to pass through just in case anyone wants to spend \u00a350 on a packet of crisps or a single fruit pastille.</p> <p>And it\u2019s not cheap, either. Train fares have increased way out step with inflation, meaning <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2016/jan/04/action-for-rail-357-season-ticket-37-rome-95-berlin\">the percentage of our salaries we spend on train fares is now six times higher than many of our European counterparts</a> \u2013 and that\u2019s if you plan ahead. If you want to travel from London to Manchester, and have not booked a ticket, be prepared to sell a kidney or stay at home. Frequent train travellers have to plan ahead, booking months in advance to avoid massive fares. But there is still the risk that you will turn up on the day and the train will have lost its seat reservations for no apparent reason, and you will end up wedged between the door and the bathroom. Other than a music festival, a train is the only thing you might have to buy a ticket for and still end up spending an hour standing next to a toilet.</p> <p>I feel sorry for the commuters affected by the Southern Rail chaos, especially because I hail from Croydon and have experienced that mayhem firsthand. As if being from Croydon wasn\u2019t bad enough. When I was growing up, and periodically going to India to visit my grandmother, my classmates would often ask me about the trains. There was an exotic fascination with people sitting on top of the carriages. Well, just to clear this up, British trains are now worse than Indian trains. Even if you\u2019re sat on the roof, at least you get a seat.</p> <p>I was once ejected from a Southern train for sitting in first class when the train was full. I informed the guard that, as the section was empty and I would have happily moved for people with first-class tickets, I didn\u2019t see what the problem was. He said: \u201cIt\u2019s far more serious than that \u2013 you have to keep that area clear in case people in wheelchairs get on.\u201d I apologised and said: \u201cI didn\u2019t realise people in wheelchairs were allowed in that section.\u201d</p> <p>He replied: \u201cYeah \u2013 only if they have a first-class ticket. Otherwise we kick them off as well.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/aug/12/virgin-trains-east-cost-staff-to-strike-in-row-over-jobs\">Virgin Trains East Coast staff to strike in row over jobs</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It\u2019s interesting how far we have moved on in our attitude to renationalisation. In the 1980s and 1990s, we consistently elected governments that essentially based their economic policies on the boardgame Monopoly, where public services were flogged off to the highest bidder. We were in thrall to Rich Uncle Pennybags, the moustachioed, monocle-wearing mascot we now call Mr Monopoly. (This is clearly a terrible name, by the way. It\u2019s like me changing my name to Grandpa Nishy Mouthjoker.)</p> <p>But there has been a change in public opinion, if not in government policy. A 2015 poll revealed nearly 60% of us support public ownership of the railways. Last year, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/mar/01/east-coast-rail-line-returns-to-private-hands\">East Coast service was reprivatised</a>. The government had taken over the running of the line after the collapse of the previous private ownership and, in public control, it had become <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2014/sep/09/state-owned-east-coast-rail-franchise-paid-225m-pounds-treasury-still-faces-privatisation\">profitable to the Treasury and reported positive customer satisfaction</a>. It is now run by Virgin Trains and, on Friday morning, staff <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/aug/12/virgin-trains-east-cost-staff-to-strike-in-row-over-jobs\">announced strike action over two weekends in August</a>. This means that I can\u2019t get back to London from the Edinburgh Fringe. Once again, comedians are punished. Truly we are the most oppressed people in society.</p> <p>Frustration with the trains is inevitable, given the daily difficulties commuters face. In France, a near fully publicly owned rail system managed to give its passengers fares far lower than the UK for almost exactly the same amount of public rail subsidy between 1996 and 2010. Furthermore, the French government has invested profits in private rail companies, which then invest in companies that run British trains. Including \u2013 surprise! \u2013 Southern. As we haemorrhage money, we are lining the pockets of <em>Riche Oncle Sacs d\u2019Argent</em>.</p> <p>Nationalisation might seem like the preserve of old-fashioned, duffel-coat-wearing, Red-Flag-singing socialists, but it also appears to be economically efficient. Labour adoped renationalisation as a policy at its 2015 autumn conference, and Jeremy Corbyn is trying to make this a key platform in his plans to be the next prime minister. Corbyn might be on to a winner here. Time will tell. Anyway, I had better head off \u2013 I\u2019ve got to start booking some train tickets for October 2025.</p> <p><em><a href=\"http://www.nishkumar.co.uk/\">Nish Kumar</a>\u2019s Actions Speak Louder Than Words Unless You Shout The Words Real Loud runs daily during the <a href=\"http://www.edfringe.com/\">Edinburgh fringe festival</a>, before touring in the autumn</em></p>",
  "<p>Summer is a time when natural light can lend an otherness to almost any subject. From Ryan McGinley\u2019s playful homage to Renaissance nudes, to Nadav Kander\u2019s eerie inlet at Mont Saint-Michel, these shots by contemporary photographers are testament to that. </p> <p>As the holiday snaps that flood Instagram show, the light can also enhance even the most cliched chronicle of a summer vacation. We take a different kind of photograph in the sun, sensing that it makes us look better because it makes us feel better. The self we display in a selfie, or so we tell ourselves, is leaner, lither, more tanned, more relaxed and less self-conscious.</p> <p>A snapshot of a sandy beach and a blue sea, especially taken through the V of tanned feet, would once have been consigned to a pile of envelopes in a cupboard, to be looked at briefly and bemusedly years later in a bout of decluttering. Now, shared in real time on Instagram, it is something else: more knowing, artful and presumptive. \u201cI am here and you are not,\u201d is the subliminal message it carries to friends back home. Yet sunlight falling on skin or sand bestows a shimmer of lightness \u2013 literal and atmospheric \u2013 on even the most inane snapshot. </p> <p>Against all of this, I can understand why even a contemporary master of deep colour such as Alec Soth would choose to shoot someone diving into a rocky swimming hole in monochrome. Here is the chill of summer, the childhood risk of summer, the dark dreamtime of an adolescent summer in which limits are being tested. It is an antidote to the dappled days of sun, sea, sand and luminous light. <em>(<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/seanohagan\">Sean O\u2019Hagan</a>)</em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"148fb3ebadd816161c25e7166d926d74abc3b8e9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/148fb3ebadd816161c25e7166d926d74abc3b8e9/0_0_2200_1650/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Near Kaaterskill Falls, New York, 2012 by Alec Soth.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Near Kaaterskill Falls, New York, 2012 by Alec Soth.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alec Soth</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>\u2018I tried a cliff-dive myself.

The area has a curious Rip Van Winkle quality at that time of year, which made for a deeply romantic trip. I had created this kind of imaginary newspaper called the LBM Dispatch, naming myself chief photographer. I was working with a friend, a writer. We would drive around a region, allocating time to stop and report on whatever we found.</p> <p>I had mapped out various swimming holes. There are loads dotted across upstate NY: places where people gather to swim and, as it turns out, cliff-dive. It wasn\u2019t at this spot, but at another, that I tried it out for myself \u2013 and it was totally thrilling. That feeling of letting go fascinated me. It tied in to ideas of escape that I have explored for years.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Suicide fantasies, escape fantasies \u2013 this has elements of both</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>I was experimenting with flash, working like a news photographer, who pauses and instantaneously zeroes in on someone\u2019s life. There is something about the result here that\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/gallery/2015/mar/31/the-best-of-weegees-new-york-street-photography-in-pictures\">evocative of Weegee</a> [Arthur Fellig, famed for his black-and-white photographs of New York crime scenes from the 1930s]. It seems timeless too: I don\u2019t think you could ever guess when it was taken.</p> <p>The image was published in Songbook, my most recent work, but it\u2019s linked to two earlier projects. I shot a series called Niagara, attracted to the area and its motels by the falls \u2013 and the suicides. A more recent project was Broken Manual, which focused on men who run away, attempting to escape from the world and their lives. This cliff-dive is reminiscent of elements in both: fantasies of suicide, fantasies of retreat \u2013 it\u2019s all in there.</p> <p>Maybe that\u2019s depressing, too depressing for a snapshot of summer, but my work is often chilly. To me, seasons are somewhat abstract, but summer is almost mythical in its ability to evoke childhood, unfamiliar places, a moment outside day-to-day life, like a dream. That\u2019s what the picture is: a dream-like moment of total release. <em>(Interview by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/edward-siddons\">Edward Siddons</a>)</em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"c7f85614cb96eb1fd0d59a868854dc38e879716d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c7f85614cb96eb1fd0d59a868854dc38e879716d/0_0_1384_2076/667.jpg\" alt=\"Barn Flip (Red), 2013 by Ryan McGinley\" width=\"667\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Barn Flip (Red), 2013 by Ryan McGinley</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ryan McGinley/Courtesy Team Gallery</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>\u2018They\u2019re like the nudes in the Sistine Chapel\u2019 <br><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2010/apr/13/ryan-mcginley\">Ryan McGinley</a></h2> <p>I love shooting out in nature during the summer because it\u2019s warm and people are comfortable being naked. I can shoot all day and take my time to find the surprises that make an image exceptional. Something about being outside at this time of year seems extra spiritual and serene.<br></p> <p>This shot consists of three friends of mine, all artists: photographer Carlotta Kohl is on the left, painter Christopher Bostwick is in the middle, and film-maker Petra Collins is on the right. The location is deepest <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/west-virginia\">West Virginia</a>. For my shoots, I look for properties to rent that have lots of land to explore, usually farms with unique old structures that I like to include in my shots. When I rent a place like this in the middle of nowhere, they are usually inexpensive, so I am easily able to take my crew of 15 along.</p> <p>This was shot at dusk, a time I like because the sky turns beautiful shades of blue. I set up an airbag for the models to jump on to. When Christopher started doing flips, it reminded me of looking up at the nudes in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/jonathanjonesblog/2014/oct/30/why-vatican-thinks-tourists-idiots-3d-michelangelo-sistine\">the Sistine Chapel</a>. I grew up Roman Catholic and was influenced by Michelangelo\u2019s nudes. Actually, the flying nudes of the Renaissance have been in my DNA from a very early age. One of the reasons I initially cast Petra was because she looked as if she had stepped out of a Renaissance painting.</p> <p>While we were shooting, one of the owner\u2019s friends, a biker, stood there watching us. He was drunk and kind of mumbling things to himself as all the models were jumping out of the barn. I told him to go away, to let the models have their privacy, but he kept coming back. The following morning, at around 3am, he walked into our house and yelled: \u201cWho wants to party?\u201d We were all terrified. That afternoon, the owner told us, he had gotten on his motorcycle at around 7am, driven off, crashed and died. <em>(<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/ben-beaumont-thomas\">Ben Beaumont-Thomas</a>)</em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"371e7f48906117345814958b52551bcb27955f03\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/371e7f48906117345814958b52551bcb27955f03/0_0_2538_1998/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Mont Saint-Michel, Normandy, France 2002 by Nadav Kander\" width=\"1000\" height=\"787\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mont Saint-Michel, Normandy, France 2002 by Nadav Kander</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nadav Kander</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>\u2018This shot only exists in summer\u2019 <br><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/nadav-kander\">Nadav Kander</a></h2> <p>Water has always been important to me. There is something enchanting about its stillness, how it covers everything, how it flows along the path of least resistance and submerges everything in a level way. There\u2019s something starkly beautiful \u2013 and calming \u2013 about it. I think you are either a mountain person or a lake person. I\u2019m a lake person.</p> <p>I took this around <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/mar/22/supertide-mont-saint-michel-france\">Mont Saint-Michel</a> in France, just over the Channel from Cornwall. In autumn, the area turns orange, and in winter it has hardly any colour at all, so summer is the only time that this shot really exists.</p> <p>I found the flatness of the scene captivating. When I made my way through it, all these inlets started to look rather surreal. That\u2019s something I\u2019m always searching for elements of, in among the normal. I never photograph nature in its purity, hence the castle looming in the distance. It\u2019s a symbol of man, whose traces can be detected elsewhere in the landscape. Sheep aren\u2019t native to the area. The sea grass ought to be much longer, but the introduction of livestock means the floodplain is grazed. That\u2019s what gives the picture its clean lines and gently folding greenery.</p> <p>My work always has something to do with man, or at least his mark, whether that is a felled tree, concrete objects or, in this case, a whole fortress built into the sea. Artists in earlier times, especially in England, would be asked to paint a landscape and, even if it was fictitious, they would insert a ruin into a far hillside. It lent reason, the weight of past lives. The castle\u2019s inclusion here tells us that man has lived here, much has come before us, our own life is short.</p> <p>So you could say the shot is more portrait than landscape. Without that building, I think it\u2019s just pictorial and nothing more. The castle adds a history, a layer into time, access to humanity across the years. <em>(ES)</em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"0fbbce263b8eb7c4a5459a13a2a3c76e2b9be023\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0fbbce263b8eb7c4a5459a13a2a3c76e2b9be023/0_0_4200_3387/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ox and Angela, plastic surgeon and wife, Rio, Brazil, October 2002 by Zed Nelson\" width=\"1000\" height=\"806\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ox and Angela, plastic surgeon and wife, Rio, Brazil, October 2002 by Zed Nelson</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Zed Nelson</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>\u2018He\u2019d a gun down the back of his trousers\u2019 <br><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/zed-nelson\">Zed Nelson</a></h2> <p>I spent five years working on my Love Me series, travelling to 17 countries to look at the phenomenon of body obsession and self-image.

I didn\u2019t even know about his wife. She\u2019s a carnival queen: she would dance on floats, something a lot of women in Brazil aspire to.

It turned out to be a good icebreaker. His wife came down in this carnival costume with enormous wings. It was a bit much, so I asked her to take the wings off. Then he scooped the dogs up off the sofa and everything looked perfect.</p> <p>He had done about six or seven operations on her, so she is sort of his creation, his Frankenstein\u2019s monster. At the time, he was having an operating theatre built on the top floor of his apartment. Smiling and posing for the camera has become such a social contrivance that I usually discourage it. But look at her body, look at that pose \u2013 she probably learned how to sit as a child. What a flattering angle it is. And that\u2019s an interesting thing to document.</p> <p>The two hours I spent there were rather surreal. He had a gun tucked down the back of his trousers.

The man in the photo is Syrian. His name is Mohammed Ganom. He avoided the camps due to his disability and his urgent need for medical attention. He was taken to Pikpa [now called the Lesbos Solidarity camp], something of a sanctuary on Lesbos, where pregnant women, the injured, severely ill and dying find some form of respite.

To me, the shot speaks of vulnerability. It demonstrates how easily politics can pose a threat, not only to the human spirit, but to our physical being.</p> <p>There were holidaymakers on the island complaining about being disturbed by the flood of people. Refugees were turned away from hotels, even when they could afford a room. Some locals would rail against newcomers in the middle of the street.

It was 1979 and I was studying at Yale. I wasn\u2019t interested in people of another class per se. I was interested in people who had no interest in photography. The obvious focus is the young girl standing in the paddling pool. The inflatable around her waist is ridiculous. She couldn\u2019t have drowned \u2013 the water was less than a foot deep.</p> <p>Summer is fleeting, just like youth. This shot harks back to that time in your life when standing in 12 inches of water was truly fun. There\u2019s a kind of innocence to it: you would think it was just an innocuous snapshot taken at random \u2013 but it wasn\u2019t. In those days, I didn\u2019t use a handheld. My work all had to be rather deliberate because I was shooting with a tripod.</p> <p>There is a weirdness to the scene, but that\u2019s good. I wanted it to be slightly suspicious.

It was summer when he died, not in our home state of Virginia, but in Italy where he spent his summers and winters. In the spring and fall, he would alight in Lexington, the town in Virginia where we both grew up, and almost as soon as his bags were unpacked he would begin painting.</p> <p>He had been a friend of my parents, to whom he gave his first sculpture. They supported him by buying, out of his arms, a painting he was carrying down the street one day in 1952. Cy had made it with pencil and house paint.</p> <p>He loved our part of the south and his work reflected southerners\u2019 innately contradictory qualities of ambiguity and plain-spokenness, cruelty and kindness, illumination and obscurity. Like all southerners, he was keenly aware of death, but the shadow of mortality failed to darken his brilliance, and the famous slow pace of southern life only reminded Cy how much harder he had to work.</p> <p>And work he did. Considering he was in the fall of his life, his later paintings were extravagant with colour and gesture, import and whimsy. It was the poetic force of his personality that compelled me to take pictures in his studio. These bright colours, these brilliant vestiges, suggest both an absence and a great presence.

In the morning, somebody called me to say an airplane had flown into a skyscraper. Of course, I wanted to go and see it. I took my car out, thinking I would take a shortcut through Brooklyn and go over one of the southern bridges. But the bridges had been closed.</p> <p>As I drove, I heard on the radio that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/september11\">a second plane had crashed</a>. Just by chance, I came to this little spot on the East River that looked directly across the water at what was happening. In front of me was this group of five people chatting. So I pressed the shutter \u2013 just three times \u2013 and moved on. I was still trying to get closer. I\u2019m not sure if I was using my Leica or my Canon, but I was definitely shooting on film.</p> <p>When I got to the Magnum office that afternoon, I saw what my fellow photographers had done. Steve McCurry lives in a high-rise just a kilometre from Ground Zero \u2013 all he\u2019d had to do was go on to his roof to get the most amazing pictures. As the others came in and developed their images in the darkroom, I felt I\u2019d got nothing.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>If I'd asked their permission, it would have spoiled the moment</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>In the days following the attacks, there were all sorts of interesting, horrific and depressing things to photograph. We had so much material, we decided to make a book: New York September 11, by Magnum Photographers. I used very few of my own shots because I thought I\u2019d blown it. Then, five years later, the director of a photography museum in Munich asked to do a retrospective of my work. He was going through my pictures and suddenly came to the 9/11 shots. He said: \u201cThese are incredible \u2013 the contrast of the young people in the sunshine, looking so relaxed, with the smoke and death in the background.\u201d Of course, unconsciously, I might have seen those two trees as a frame to the group, but it was pure instinct. I was there for less than a minute.</p> <p>Later, I found out that the people in the shot got a little upset when they saw the picture. That blonde woman in the centre is a photographer herself, a portraitist, and that\u2019s a very different ballgame. Had I asked if I could take their picture, I would have already spoiled the moment. Or they might have told me to fuck off.</p> <p>It was September, the end of summer \u2013 and the end of naivete, in a way. It was also the beginning of what we are all living with now.

One held a child in her arms. Black cloth had been draped behind them, making it impossible to know where the video was filmed.</p> <p>The fighter in the video, who has not been identified, also had a message for the Chibok parents.</p> <p>\u201cThey should know that their children are still in our hands,\u201d he said, his face wrapped in camouflage cloth.

However, analysts said the girls\u2019 injuries did not seem consistent with airstrikes, but were more similar to machete wounds, suggesting that the footage could have been staged.</p> <p>The fighter\u2019s message to Buhari was that if his troops tried to rescue the girls, Boko Haram would kill them.

In Two Man Show, the women\u2019s nakedness has a matter-of-fact ease, as if nudity is the most natural thing in the world and being happy in your own body is a right.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e6b9e5b94a23308714db5ba01220a7baae8332a4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e6b9e5b94a23308714db5ba01220a7baae8332a4/235_137_4587_2752/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Skilful and hilarious \u2026 Lucy McCormick in Triple Threat.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Skilful and hilarious \u2026 Lucy McCormick in Triple Threat.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tamsin Drury</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Good stuff, but I do wonder about the fact that all these naked female bodies on display are ones of young perfection \u2013 not an ounce of excess flesh, and all <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/jan/19/year-of-the-bush-female-body-hair-cameron-diaz-pubic\">clipped and trimmed</a> to conform to what quite honestly is a male idea of female beauty \u2013 but as Nicole Henriksen observes in her account of working as a stripper, <a href=\"https://tickets.edfringe.com/whats-on/nicole-henriksen-is-makin-it-rain\">Nicole Henriksen is Makin It Rain</a> (Underbelly), there are many daily assumptions made about the female body, and also about women who use their bodies as part of their work. Henriksen\u2019s show highlights the fact that we make <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/jul/03/the-problem-with-being-yourself-self-esteem\">distinctions between the female body exposed in a strip club</a> and the same female body doing exactly the same movements on a stage in Underbelly. Why is it OK in the latter context if it\u2019s a feminist statement, but deemed suspect in the former?</p> <p>It\u2019s these very double-standards, and the idea that the sex worker who gets raped is less deserving of sympathy and justice than \u201cgood girls\u201d who dress demurely, that are under scrutiny in these shows, which speak up loudly about the corrosive effects of shame. They prove that women are angry about the everyday sexism they encounter. And if getting that message across involves flaunting the naked female body then so be it, because \u2013 as the seminal <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Our_Bodies,_Ourselves\">70s feminist handbook of women\u2019s health</a> proclaimed \u2013 these are \u201cOur Bodies, Ourselves\u201d. </p>",
  "<p>It took a little over an hour, and the rasping contribution from the ego leading his team\u2019s line, before Jos\u00e9 Mourinho let the rather snarling facade slip and his true emotions show. The Manchester United manager had watched his new side establish a lead which already seemed insurmountable when Zlatan Ibrahimovic collected possession around 25 yards out and, with Bournemouth\u2019s players still dizzied by Anthony Martial\u2019s sprint, skimmed a shot through Steve Cook, across Artur Boruc and into the far corner.</p> <p>The attempt was invited by the lack of a challenge but executed with pinpoint accuracy, and all from a move the forward had kickstarted deep inside United territory. While Ibrahimovic was mobbed by team-mates out on the turf, the manager sprinted out of the technical area screaming his own celebration with the coaching staff close behind. Maybe Mourinho had simply been eager for a dash of real class to supply gloss to a first Premier League game in charge. Certainly he was convinced it was a goal which confirmed success and a positive start. Regardless, that conversion from distance ensured the scoreline reflected his team\u2019s overall dominance.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2016/aug/14/bournemouth-v-manchester-united-premier-league-live\">Bournemouth 1-3 Manchester United: Premier League \u2013 as it happened</a> </p> </aside>  <p>These remain early days and this side, once Paul Pogba and Henrikh Mkhitaryan have been properly integrated, will become even more efficient in time. The perfectionist in the Portuguese manager will ensure as much. But a new era has still begun in hugely encouraging fashion and Mourinho departed satisfied with plenty he had witnessed on the south coast.</p> <p>Eric Bailly, the \u00a330m addition from Villarreal, was aggressive and authoritative despite having missed training all week with an injury sustained in the Community Shield win. Juan Mata and Ander Herrera offered flashes of incision and invention, Martial contributed from wide, while Ibrahimovic retains the strut that so terrified French club defences last season.</p> <p>He was not always a presence in the penalty area, where he did not muster a touch before the break, but he has now scored on his bows in Serie&#xa0;A, La&#xa0;Liga, Ligue&#xa0;1, the Champions League and Premier League. His scripts continue to be expertly written. \u201cIt is not easy,\u201d the Swede said. \u201cEverything is new for me, from my team-mates to the club, the environment, the new stadiums. But slowly I am getting settled in and I just play my game and make the team win.\u201d</p> <p>The influence he can have on this dressing room can be pivotal and, even if his combination with Wayne Rooney may instinctively appear awkward, they could each point to rewards here and even the odd glimpse of a proper partnership.</p> <p>Yet, in keeping with true Mourinho pragmatism, this was only really about the result in an arena where United had succumbed under Louis van Gaal last season. The satisfaction was born of a rusty initial display eventually yielding a commanding win. Those early exchanges, where opportunities were spurned in overhit passes or scuffed attempts, appeared forgotten once a three-goal advantage was established. \u201cTo control the game without having problems makes this a good victory,\u201d the manager said. He has never lost his first Premier League game of a season and, once his side were ahead, that sequence was never threatened by Bournemouth.</p> <p>Eddie Howe could justifiably bemoan a lack of fortune in that opening concession, which served to puncture local optimism whipped up by 40 minutes of parity. Then, from nothing, Simon Francis\u2019s back-pass was ill-judged, underhit and collected by a galloping Mata. His clipped shot was blocked by an on-rushing Artur Boruc, only for the ball to rebound off the stumbling Francis\u2019s shins and back into the Spaniard\u2019s path. He thumped the ball gleefully into the empty net.</p> <p>Mata had never scored a Premier League goal for Mourinho having featured 13 times for him at Chelsea in 2013\u201114. After the humiliation at Wembley last week, when the substitute was substituted in stoppage time apparently due to a lack of height in the side, this was a more satisfying intervention.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/aug/13/paul-pogba-adnan-januzaj-manchester-united\">Paul Pogba and Adnan Januzaj are two sides of the same coin | Daniel Taylor</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The goal did also perhaps illustrate why Howe is still seeking defensive recruits. The Stoke utility player Marc Wilson is expected to return to the south coast \u2013where he had previously played for Portsmouth \u2013 in a deal worth an initial \u00a32m this week, and Cook was almost exposed as Ibrahimovic\u2019s flick sent Rooney bustling through before Boruc blocked smartly.</p> <p>That proved to be a brief respite. Antonio Valencia was soon barging beyond Charlie Daniels to clip over a cross which was met by a wild attempt from Martial. True to the home side\u2019s ill luck, the mis-hit bounced kindly for Rooney, alone on the edge of the six-yard box, who simply guided his header down and back across the Pole to double the lead.</p> <p>Bournemouth, with Lewis Cook quietly impressive in central midfield, lacked the bite to wound the visitors, their forward players prone to over-elaborate in promising positions. Jordon Ibe, Joshua King and Callum Wilson may be more potent threats on the counter-attack away from home, but the substitutes Lewis Grabban and Benik Afobe at least ruffled United once Ibrahimovic had enjoyed his moment. It was Grabban\u2019s pass which was collected by Adam Smith, the full-back thumping a fine consolation beyond David de Gea. The Spaniard had to save well from Andrew Surman, too, in stoppage time.</p> <p>\u201cWe were well in the game up to that first goal,\u201d Howe said. \u201cIt was out of nothing: it wasn\u2019t like they\u2019d broken our shape and scored an outstanding goal. It was scrappy.\u201d Mourinho will hardly care. There was a punch of the air at the end, apparently aimed towards, and returned by, Ed Woodward up in the stand. His tenure at United is up and running.</p> <p><strong>Man of the match</strong> Eric Bailly (Manchester United)</p>",

United won a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/may/17/manchester-united-bournemouth-premier-league-match-report\">hastily rearranged, poorly attended fixture</a>, sealing their Europa League status but harming Louis van Gaal\u2019s Cup final preparations. It was less than three months ago.</p> <p>A very different Manchester United swagger into Bournemouth today. After three years of post-Ferguson mourning, the Jos\u00e9 Mourinho era has begun with a bang. Old friends Paul Pogba, Attacking Football and Title Chasing are back in town. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/aug/12/paul-pogba-suspended-manchester-united\">Pogba is suspended today</a>, but Henrikh Mkhitaryan and Zlatan Ibrahimovic should feature in a supercharged unit built to consign recent history into distant memory. </p> <p>First in front of the juggernaut are little ol\u2019 Bournemouth, but anyone assuming a formality should study a) the English top flight, 1888-2016, and b) the sides\u2019 other meeting last term, where <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/dec/12/bournemouth-manchester-united-premier-league-match-report\">United were memorably undone</a>. That came just days after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/dec/05/chelsea-bournemouth-premier-league-match-report\">Glenn Murray popped up at Stamford Bridge</a> to earn a special place in Mourinho\u2019s nightmares. </p> <p>Bournemouth have assimilated into the top tier with astonishing ease, and are enjoying a scaled-down reboot of their own, spending \u00a330m on four players this summer. That would have been sheer fantasy not so long ago \u2013 Maxim Demin bought half the club for less than \u00a31m in 2011 \u2013 but this new ambition has barely registered on a long, hot summer of spending led by United.</p> <p>Mourinho has been quick to preach caution early in the season, but will surely want vengeance for the humiliation both he and his new team suffered last season. Both clubs have been extensively editing their history books since May. Let\u2019s see whose new era is in better shape. <strong>Kick off is at 1.30pm; team news to follow.</strong></p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-08-14T11:34:21.156Z\">at 12.34pm BST</time></p>  </div>",
  "<p>The Florida Keys are three months away from a straw poll vote on whether to release millions of genetically modified mosquitoes on an island just east of Key West, and the tourist destination is awash in lawn signs. </p> <p>Alongside the typical signs to vote for court clerk, judge, sheriff or school board are signs that showcase the overhead view of a mosquito and read: \u201cNO CONSENT to release of genetically modified mosquitoes\u201d.</p> <p>For the last five years, the biotechnology company Oxitec has been developing a plan to experimentally release the GMO mosquitoes in the Keys, which scientists hope could eventually impede the spread of the Zika virus. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--supporting\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/maps/embed/aug/2016-08-14T14:09:55.html\" data-alt=\"Key Haven map\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/maps/embed/aug/2016-08-14T14:09:55.html\">Key Haven map</a> </figure>  <p>\u201cIt is the perfect scientific trial site,\u201d said Derric Nimmo, a spokesman for Oxitec and a molecular biologist, about Key Haven. \u201cWouldn\u2019t it be wonderful if the Keys mosquito control district could say, \u2018We don\u2019t have Aedes aegypti here \u2013 you can\u2019t get dengue or Zika?\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Each male mosquito released by Oxitec will carry a gene to prevent his offspring from reaching adulthood. Scientists hope that the genetically modified males will mate with wild females to undercut the population of Aedes aegypti mosquitoes, the type that spread Zika through Brazil. </p> <p>But the prospect of ridding the neighborhood of a disease-carrying pest hasn\u2019t quelled public dissatisfaction. </p> <p>The GM mosquitoes dominate local news in Key West. Mosquito control commissioners up for reelection face multiple opponents. The city of Key West formally opposed the mosquitoes\u2019 introduction in 2012. </p> <p>\u201cWhy are you pushing [sic] down our throats?\u201d asked Mila de Mier, a Spanish transplant to Key West and a real estate agent. She has led the charge against the mosquitoes\u2019 release, collecting nearly <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.change.org/p/say-no-to-genetically-modified-mosquitoes-release-in-the-florida-keys\">170,000 signatures</a> in an online petition against the experiment.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9b8957b5f9c8e9daca932ad00b9d17cec8244aa0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9b8957b5f9c8e9daca932ad00b9d17cec8244aa0/0_137_4067_2440/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Oxitec mosquito larvae are shown.

Globally, <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-03-07/this-biotech-billionaire-says-he-fights-zika-better-than-the-un\">analysts predict</a> Oxitec\u2019s mosquito could bring in up to $400m in annual sales for its parent company, Intrexon. </p> <p>With millions in potential sales at stake, the experiment in the environmentally sensitive, populous area hinges on the fundamental question proposed by opponents: do the people who live where an experiment is to be conducted have a right to decide whether to go forward? </p> <h2>\u2018No consent\u2019</h2> <p>Signs saying \u201cNo consent\u201d are scattered across what looks like about half the front yards in Key Haven, a neighborhood of neat, high-end homes where the streets stretch out into the Gulf of Mexico like fingers. </p> <p>The neighborhood is distinctly, extravagantly Floridian. Corinthian columns stand astride stucco doorways, balancing arches of hurricane-shuttered homes. Large boats park in driveways. Glass front doors reveal infinity pools and Gulf vistas. </p> <p>For some in the neighborhood, the question of Oxitec\u2019s trial is one of convenience. </p> <p>\u201cIt would be so buggy,\u201d said Andrea Spottswood, 62, a prim woman who wears a pressed button-up, pink lipstick and large diamond earrings. The trial \u201cmay be worth a try\u201d, but \u201cwe don\u2019t want to be the lab rats, and they were all going to be dumped down this street.\u201d </p> <p>She, like others in the neighborhood, is skeptical of the company\u2019s basic claims. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"901f4c4160cd20bee78bd5350b367689c824f4ff\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/901f4c4160cd20bee78bd5350b367689c824f4ff/0_78_3872_2323/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Meagan Hull, left, and real estate agent Mila de Mier both oppose genetically modified mosquitoes, and say they\u2019re willing to take the fight all the way.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Meagan Hull, left, and real estate agent Mila de Mier both oppose genetically modified mosquitoes, and say they\u2019re willing to take the fight all the way.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jessica Glenza/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cThey say this mosquito doesn\u2019t bite, but I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m buying it,\u201d Spottswood said. Oxitec\u2019s plan is to mostly release male mosquitoes, which don\u2019t bite. Its application with the FDA says that only one out of every 1,000 mosquitoes would be female. Asked whether the trial could advance science, Spottswood said, \u201cRight. They\u2019re also going to make a lot of money.\u201d</p> <p>Intrexon appears keenly aware of this. </p> <p>Though Nimmo has said Oxitec is running a mainly door-to-door public education-style campaign aimed at Monroe county\u2019s 52,000 voters, Intrexon has intensely lobbied Congress. </p> <p>By April, the large international law firm Sidley Austin LLP estimated Intrexon paid <a href=\"http://soprweb.senate.gov/index.cfm?event=getFilingDetails&amp;filingID=961E9D19-E2D1-4B80-8EA9-171D70909F81&amp;filingTypeID=51\">at least $400,000</a> for the firm to advocate for Oxitec\u2019s mosquitoes, hoping to hurry along approval and secure government funding. </p> <p>Behind another \u201cNo consent\u201d sign lives Joan Lord-Papy, 85, a native islander. Inside her home, daytime TV rambles. For Lord-Papy, memories of mosquito swarms are vivid. </p> <h2>An island divided</h2> <p>Lord-Papy recalls a time, in the 1950s, when mosquitoes were so bad that drivers \u201cpicked up anybody who broke down\u201d on \u201cthe 18-mile stretch\u201d between Florida City to Key Largo out of sympathy for the hundreds of bites they would endure. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/05/florida-genetically-modified-mosquitoes-zika\">Florida cleared to release genetically modified mosquitoes in Zika fight</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Others recounted the lore of motorists who preferred sleeping in their vehicle to changing a flat at dusk, when ambush by bloodsuckers was certain. Lord-Papy herself served on the Florida Keys Mosquito Control Board for 20 years beginning in 1962. </p> <p> Mosquito populations on the island have declined significantly over the decades, with the institution of a robust mosquito control program. </p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m local. I was born and raised here, so I\u2019ve always known mosquitoes and what they do to the community,\u201d she said. But, she admits, \u201cI really don\u2019t know that much about the spray they want to use. I don\u2019t know how it will affect children, really.\u201d </p> <p>Phil Goodman views this sort of opposition as an uninformed electorate standing in the way of science. </p> <p>Goodman is one of the two holdouts on the Keys mosquito control board, and also its chairman, who has refused to abide by the public opinion.<strong> </strong>A former chemist and chemical company owner, Goodman complains that people call Oxitec\u2019s OX513A patented insects \u201cfranken-skeeters\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re in the public health business, not the public opinion business,\u201d he said. The board, he believes, \u201cwill make a better decision than the majority of uninformed people.\u201d </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"b3241712fb2934c8b2f8821c95a3e5c81f43b807\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b3241712fb2934c8b2f8821c95a3e5c81f43b807/0_0_1600_2407/665.png\" alt=\"How Oxitec mosquitoes work to control Aedes aegypti to help prevent the spread of virus.\" width=\"665\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">How Oxitec mosquitoes work to control Aedes aegypti to help prevent the spread of virus.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Oxitec</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Oxitec was, in fact, invited to the island by the county\u2019s mosquito control commissioners, a group once in favor of the experiment, but who are now divided after years of public outcry. The vote on the mosquito release is non-binding, and three of five mosquito control board members have agreed to abide by the outcome.</p> <p>\u201cLet\u2019s have a scientific debate and come to some kind of conclusion,\u201d Goodman said. Goodman fears a slippery slope, where every new insecticide will require public approval.</p> <p>The district has already invested in the experiment. It donated space to Oxitec to build a laboratory in Marathon, in the middle Keys, and expects to donate up to $200,000 in free labor each year the experiment goes forward. </p> <p>Certainly, the current methods employed by mosquito control districts against the Aedes are imperfect.</p> <p>The notoriously difficult-to-control bug was nearly eradicated in the <a href=\"http://www.scielosp.org/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&amp;pid=S1020-49891997000100023\">1950s by governments</a> in Latin America, who undertook a military-style campaign to spray DDT inside homes. Aedes aegypti mosquitoes also spread <a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/dengue/entomologyecology/\">dengue</a>, yellow fever and chikungunya, diseases with potentially life-threatening symptoms. </p> <p>Miami-Dade County began spraying Naled in August, after the first mainland cases of Zika transmitted by local mosquitoes were found in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/10/zika-virus-miami-florida-cases-mosquito-wynwood\">Wynwood neighborhood</a>. About 6m Floridian acres are sprayed each year. But Naled\u2019s effectiveness in Aedes control is widely debated, both for its effectiveness and its adverse impacts. </p> <p>\u201cI got a complaint the other day \u2013 someone found 30 dead bees on the side of the road,\u201d Goodman said. Naled kills just about any flying insect the size of a mosquito aloft when planes spray overhead. </p> <p>Public education can also only go so far. </p> <p>In the Keys, ubiquitous door hangers remind residents to empty standing pools of water. Aedes mosquitoes can breed in pools as tiny as a bottle cap, making every wrinkle of a tarp potential habitat. Goodman suspects some Aedes mosquitoes are breeding in abandoned cisterns on the islands, which used to supply residents\u2019 water. </p> <p>Oxitec\u2019s trial wouldn\u2019t be the first one the company conducts, nor the last. The company has released GMO mosquitoes in <a href=\"http://www.oxitec.com/oxitec-vector-control-solution-in-brazil-attacking-source-of-zika-virus/\">Brazil</a>, <a href=\"http://www.oxitec.com/press-release-oxitecs-genetically-engineered-mosquitoes-in-panama-pilot-achieve-over-90-control-of-the-mosquito-responsible-for-outbreaks-of-dengue-fever-and-chikungunya/\">Panama</a>, <a href=\"http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2011/01/gm-mosquito-release-malaysia-surprises-opponents-and-scientists-again\">Malaysia</a> and recently the Cayman Islands. And it has submitted applications to begin trials in Sri Lanka and India. The longest such trial has been approximately two years, increasing Keys residents\u2019 concerns about unknown long-term consequences. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Opening this Pandora\u2019s box, sometimes you don\u2019t see the impact until five, 10, 15 years down the road</p> <footer> <cite>Mila de Mier</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Most trials have resulted in reduced Aedes populations, Oxitec has said. Nimmo cites a 90% or better rate of reduction in most populations. But the same rate of effectiveness is likely to be significantly lower in locations with more complex geography.</p> <p>Opponents have raised other concerns as well: for every 1,000 mosquitoes released, one will be female, the sort that bite.</p> <p>De Mier and other opponents ask: what happens if a female Oxitec mosquito bites a woman? What if it passes the \u201ckill gene\u201d, as opponents call it, to people? Oxitec scientists analyzed the saliva of roughly six mosquitoes, the gene was not detected, and scientists concluded that humans were unlikely to be exposed. But that hasn\u2019t soothed critics. </p> <p>\u201cOpening this Pandora\u2019s box, sometimes you don\u2019t see the impact until five, 10, 15 years down the road,\u201d De Mier said. </p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not against genetically modified at all,\u201d she said. \u201cSometimes, I don\u2019t know what I put on my table, but that\u2019s the difference \u2013 it\u2019s about choice,\u201d she said, referencing the GMO food supply. \u201cPermission has not been asked or given \u2026 This is only for Oxitec\u2019s benefit.\u201d </p> <p>What about the impact on tourism, de Mier asked? The Keys depend almost solely on visitors to the warm teal waters for income, with the hotel occupancy rates near 100% in February and March, and <a href=\"http://www.keywesttravelguide.com/key-west-tourism-statistics/\">tens of thousands of visitors</a> arriving from around the world in winter months. </p> <p>Meagan Hull, 45, another local opponent, said she decided against a vacation after learning Oxitec would release the mosquitoes on the Cayman Islands. \u201cNow, I don\u2019t want to go to the Caymans. I mean, come on, they\u2019re ruining the world for us!\u201d</p> <p>De Mier said: \u201cYou see how pretty is this place.

They later admitted responsibility and pleaded guilty in the hope of being given a more lenient sentence. </p> <p>The women faced serving six years and eight months in prison, after their plea bargain averted the prospect of a maximum sentence of 15 years.</p> <p>McCollum and Reid had been in Virgen de Fatima prison in Lima, but were moved to Ancon 2 prison in May 2014, where McCollum was reportedly placed in a cell with poor sanitation facilities along with 30 other inmates.</p> <p>She was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/apr/01/michaella-mccollum-british-drug-smuggler-released-peru-prison\">freed at the end of March</a> following legislation on early prison release that came into effect in Peru last year.

In a post on Essafi\u2019s Facebook page in June, the pair rejected criticism of their lifestyle.</p> <p>\u201cWe spend most of our time in the gym. Eating healthy food and making the best of it.

So three months later he bought a fake passport and took a flight to Germany \u2013 or so he hoped. The plane went via Kuala Lumpur, and the border police there detected his false paperwork. He was promptly sent back to Turkey, where he was taken to a detention room, instead of being readmitted.</p> <p>\u201cI thought it would be hours before they would let me back in,\u201d Mansour says, recalling his immediate detention. \u201cPeople said they would send me back [to Malaysia], but I said that\u2019s impossible, I\u2019m Syrian.\u201d</p> <p>But his fellow detainees were right. After a few hours, Turkish border guards told Mansour he was to be sent back to Malaysia. \u201cI said I wanted to apply for asylum. But they said: \u2018We have 2 million Syrians here [in Turkey], and we don\u2019t want any more.\u201d</p> <p>Malaysia didn\u2019t want him either.

Mansour slept in a small room with about 40 other people facing a similar predicament.</p> <p>\u201cThere were no windows and I didn\u2019t see daylight for eight months,\u201d he says. \u201cBut they kept the lights on 24 hours a day. I don\u2019t know how I got out of that room capable of walking. </p> <p>\u201cEven now I can\u2019t walk 300 metres without getting exhausted. You can\u2019t imagine what it\u2019s like to be in a room like that without any space and any natural light.\u201d</p> <p>Worst of all, one of the other detainees, an extremist, took a dislike to him, allegedly attacking Mansour three times. \u201cHe used to make things very hard for me,\u201d says Mansour. \u201cHe used to call me an infidel, and he literally used to say to other people that they should kill me and then they\u2019d go to heaven.\u201d</p> <p>After the third attack, eight months into his limbo, Mansour tried to go to Lebanon. But there he was also stopped at the airport, and sent back to Turkey on the same plane he came by.</p> <p>To sustain himself, Mansour would watch films on his iPad, and he took particular strength from a book by a Syrian activist, Mostafa Khalifa, documenting life inside the prisons of President Bashar al-Assad.

  "<p>It is a shock to realise this is the European professional premiere of a musical by Rodgers and Hammerstein. When it was first seen on Broadway in 1947 they had already written Oklahoma! and Carousel but this show, although it ran for a decent 315 performances, never achieved the same success. Even though it is now staged by <a href=\"http://www.thomsoutherland.co.uk/\">Thom Southerland </a>with his habitual brilliance, it is not hard to see why.</p> <p> Hammerstein\u2019s aim, in his book and lyrics, was to tell the story of an American Everyman using the bare-stage techniques of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Our_Town\">Thornton Wilder\u2019s Our Town</a>. His hero, Joseph Taylor Jr, is the son of a small-town doctor who inherits his dad\u2019s medical idealism and faith in the community. Even in college, Joe yearns to be back home with his childhood sweetheart, Jennie. But Jennie has ambitious plans for Joe and, once they are married, persuades him to take a job in a big Chicago hospital where he finds himself pandering to the whims of the pampered rich. The moral issue revolves around whether Joe will stay true to his original dream or succumb to the rewards of life in the wicked city.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"404b82586f2d70f2e67c3810dcaa9f114f89ab28\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/404b82586f2d70f2e67c3810dcaa9f114f89ab28/0_13_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Gary Tushaw (Joe) and Emily Bull (Jennie) in Allegro\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Childhood sweethearts \u2026 Gary Tushaw (Joe) and Emily Bull (Jennie) in Allegro.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Scott Rylander</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p> The stock objection to the show when it first appeared was that it sentimentalised small-town life and it is perfectly true that Hammerstein\u2019s lyrics sometimes make you wince in their endorsement of domestic virtues: in one number Joe\u2019s mum tells her son that a fellow needs a girl to sit with him in the evening and \u201cagree with the things he\u2019ll say\u201d. But there is nothing inherently wrong with the show\u2019s premise that doctors should put public service before private advancement. What the musical suffers from is its abstraction from political reality. The only reference to outside events comes when Joe\u2019s father-in-law reveals that he was a victim of the 1929 crash: otherwise this is Everyman viewed in isolation from society.</p> <p> Rodgers, inevitably, writes good tunes. So Far, sung by Joe\u2019s campus date, is a real winner. The use of a permanent onstage chorus also reaches fulfilment in the title song, which evokes the fast, frenetic pace of city life where \u201cour music must be galloping and gay\u201d: watching the cast dance till they almost drop in Lee Proud\u2019s choreography is a genuine delight. Anthony Lamble\u2019s design also makes clever use of a pair of stepladders and a portable tower to whisk us through Joe\u2019s life and, as he proved in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2016/jun/08/titanic-review-charing-cross-theatre-london-thom-southerland\">Titanic</a>, Southerland is a master of marshalling large forces in a small space.</p> <p> His cast is highly engaging. Gary Tushaw lends Joe the right sincerity without a hint of smugness, Emily Bull as Jennie blends seeming sweetness with inner steel and, in a 16-strong cast, there is exemplary support from Kate Bernstein as a principled nurse and Dylan Turner as a medical Lothario. To students of the musical, the show is a fascinating collector\u2019s item, but I can\u2019t help feeling it would have been improved if Rodgers and Hammerstein had shown as much interest in the state of America as in a doctor\u2019s personal dilemma.</p> <p>\u2022 At <a href=\"http://southwarkplayhouse.co.uk/show/allegro/\">Southwark Playhouse</a>, London, until 10 September.

It was part Risk, part Monopoly, part Foursquare. But we made games and experiences \u2013 we called them mixed reality and transmedia \u2013 that, honestly, we struggled to explain to people. </p> <p> Fast forward and the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/03/pokemon-go-statue-new-orleans-park-pikachu\">global hit Pok\u00e9mon Go</a> hits the \u201ctransmedia\u201d sweet spot perfectly: a license that combines 90s game nostalgia, Japanese color palettes, full spectrum imagination and friendly competitiveness.</p> <p> I asked my young son why he thinks the game has struck such a chord and he replied that he considered it the manifestation of every Pok\u00e9mon player\u2019s dreams. Perhaps not realizing what he was saying also applied to the game designers, he added: \u201cThe game is basically letting us all do the things we have been imagining for years.\u201d</p> <p> The game focuses on some core mechanics often overlooked by western developers \u2013 collecting, sorting, cataloging \u2013 allowing players to learn complex rules and mechanics driven through the discovery of a brand new world. World-building, 18 races of Pok\u00e9mon, multiple ways to evolve creatures, multiple in-game currencies and running in countries around the world.</p> <p> But to keep Pok\u00e9mon performing at solar levels, there are number of things the developers will need to focus on, including upping the person-to-person experience.</p> <p> </p> <p> At the moment, Pok\u00e9mon Go is a very single-player-focused experience. Collect, wander, leave Pok\u00e9mon in gyms, look through inventory. Games really start to leave footprints on a soul once a person-to-person experience is felt.</p> <p> Trading, sharing and battling Pok\u00e9mon between players is going to be key to the next wave of success. Complementing the discovery of Pok\u00e9mon will be in-the-moment trials and tribulations of connecting with people: in cafes, at the bar, at work, and \u2013 the game launched just in time for summer holidays and long walks \u2013 in the schoolyard.</p> <p> These more in-person connections will demand in-game communication, such as chats, likes, pokes, seeing another person\u2019s profile and person-to-person communication.</p> <p> Once there\u2019s interaction, then we\u2019ll have clans, clubs, and teams, which will lead to leaderboards, competition and collaboration.</p> <p> And as developers get better at layering objects, people and information on to the physical world, they need to build mechanics that are interesting and engaging. </p> <p> It would be similar to what happened with Foursquare. Other companies tried to replicate the social network using similar check-in ideas and brand partnerships because they thought it was a singular phenomenon.</p> <p> But it wasn\u2019t about the specific check-in. It was that Dennis Crowley of Foursquare knew the value of location-based services. Messages that connect to you when it matters \u2013 recommending where to look, suggesting where to go.</p> <p> Commercially, the scene looks ready to include some form of advertising, whether attached to Pok\u00e9stops or connected to points of interest. It is only a matter of time before we see McDonald\u2019s Gyms or Pepsi Stadiums. Generation Z may ignore these \u2013 they\u2019re already used to skipping ads and avoiding in-game promotions, and they are generally immune to display ads. But will the pausing of the Pok\u00e9mon game to watch a mini-game push these players away, or drive advertisers into new spaces?</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/aug/12/pentagon-pokemon-go-restrictions-security-concerns\">Pentagon's Pok\u00e9mon orders: game must go (outside) for security reasons</a> </p> </aside>  <p> And what if Niantic Labs makes the physical world shine brighter in the game?

  "<p>An ambitious, almost fantastical, manifestation of agricultural technology is expected to come to fruition this fall. From the remains of an abandoned steel mill in Newark, New Jersey, the creators of AeroFarms are building what they say will be the largest vertical farm, producing two million pounds of leafy greens a year. </p> <p>Whether it even qualifies as a \u201cfarm\u201d is a matter of taste. The greens will be manufactured using a technology called aeroponics, a technique in which crops are grown in vertical stacks of plant beds, without soil, sunlight or water.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/06/vegetable-garden-submarines-navy-research\">US navy researchers conduct tests to grow vegetables on submarines</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cI ate some of the arugula here,\u201d said New Jersey governor Chris Christie after a recent visit to a smaller AeroFarms facility in the neighborhood. \u201cIt tastes fabulous. No dressing necessary.\u201d</p> <p>The farm, built in the economically depressed New Jersey city promises new jobs, millions of dollars in public-private investment, and an array of locally grown leafy greens for sale. The company has spent some $30m to bring to reality a new breed of \u201cgreen agriculture\u201d that seeks to produce more crops in less space while minimizing environmental damage, even if it means completely divorcing food production from the natural ecosystem.</p> <p>AeroFarms and other companies developing similar controlled growing climates claim to be transforming agriculture. Proponents of vertical farming call it the \u201cthird green revolution\u201d, analogizing the developments to Apple and Tesla. They tout the potential of such technology to address food shortages as the world population continues to grow. </p> <p>AeroFarms touts their products as free of pesticides and fertilizer, an attribute that investors think will attract customers who buy organic produce. \u201cWe definitely see the need for healthy food in the local area and Newark in particular,\u201d said Lata Reddy, vice-president for corporate social responsibility at Prudential Financial, one of the investors in the project. <br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"0df60db9ff2a4798dcfee5b55ba1c64ba4eae4ad\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0df60db9ff2a4798dcfee5b55ba1c64ba4eae4ad/0_103_1440_864/1000.jpg\" alt=\"produce bowls\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Is the arugula edible? Proponents say yes.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Malavika Vyawahare</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But, food that is not grown in soil may not be palatable to many, even those who are opting for organic substitutes. \u201cIf you take the soil out of the system, is it a legitimate organic system?\u201d questioned Carolyn Dimitri, director of the food studies program at New York University. The US Department of Agriculture does not consider the question of organic certification for growing methods that do not use soil, according to AeroFarms\u2019 website.</p> <p>\u201cUrban farming is trendy,\u201d Dimitri said. It remains an open question, she said, whether it will be economically viable. Prudential Financial has invested \u201cpatient capital\u201d in the venture, which is used to finance social impact projects that are unlikely to yield benefits right away. There are no aeroponics projects of this scale but AeroFarms has piloted the technology at Philip\u2019s Academy charter school in Newark, where students are served greens grown at the school.</p> <h2>Seventy times the yield of traditional farms</h2> <p>Marc Oshima, the chief marketing officer at AeroFarms, yanked open a tiny grey door in a back alley in downtown Newark that leads into an old nightclub with vividly painted walls. In 2014, AeroFarms converted the space into a research and development facility. \u201cOut there, in nature, we don\u2019t have control over sunlight, rainfall,\u201d Oshima said, \u201chere, we are giving plants what they need to thrive.\u201d</p> <p>The moist sanitized air that envelops the R&amp;D lab is missing one ingredient: the earthiness that permeates any agricultural operation. </p> <p>At the repurposed sites, AeroFarms is pushing the limits of what David Rosenberg, the company\u2019s CEO, calls \u201cprecision agriculture\u201d. The scheme ditches the romanticized ideal of farming, acres and acres of open fields dotted with men and women toiling in the sun, getting their hands dirty, in favor of enclosed urban spaces where engineers, electricians and harvesters mill about, wearing protective clothing, masks, and gloves.</p> <p>With its multicolored LED lights, computer screens lining the walls, and faithful preservation of club decor, AeroFarms\u2019 research facility could easily pass off as a sci-fi themed club. It makes a befitting setting for a company that is promising to increase crop yields by as much as 70 times compared to traditional field farms, without using any pesticides or fertilizers.</p> <p>The fine print is that the productivity is calculated using square footage occupied and not the vertical space utilized, making comparisons with ground floor-only traditional farms fraught. And critics point out that no traditional farm that size comes with a price tag of over $30m.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"f7bc8b399e4eea336d2783c032dddc763ebb95fd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f7bc8b399e4eea336d2783c032dddc763ebb95fd/24_0_1800_1080/1000.jpg\" alt=\"verfarm3\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The leafy greens nurtured under multicolored LED lights.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Malavika Vyawahare</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Much of the funding is coming from impact investing arms of big-ticket investors like Goldman Sachs and Prudential Financial. AeroFarms has leveraged its social impact goals to attract investments, promising to create jobs in a languishing economy and supplying fresh local produce to the community in Newark.</p> <p>For New Jersey, where unemployment rates have been persistently above the national average, the promise of new jobs and fresh investment has ensured buy-in from the state. Christie, visiting the smaller aeroponics facility in March lavished praise on the \u201cpublic-private\u201d partnership.</p> <p>The New Jersey Economic Development Authority provided nearly $9m in incentives, stretched over 10 years, which includes a $2.2m grant under the Economic Redevelopment and Growth program and $6.5m in tax credits.</p> <p>AeroFarms currently employs close to 100 people, and is promising more jobs in the months to come as the company grows. Like other companies in this space, it is relying on productivity gains to offset high cost of expensive technology and emerge as a successful business.</p> <p>But even growing success isn\u2019t a sure thing, let alone profit margins.</p> <h2>\u2018More like a factory than a farm\u2019</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7ef13a89b6b455fca8e0c8eef7cd7581542284d3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7ef13a89b6b455fca8e0c8eef7cd7581542284d3/0_120_1440_864/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A growing unit under construction in the Newark facility.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A growing unit under construction in the Newark facility.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Malavika Vyawahare</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>AeroFarms has grown over 250 types of leafy greens and sells more than 20 varieties of greens such as arugula, kale and spinach but hopes to expand their offering in the future. The scheme imposes height constraints; as of now, everything grown at vertical farms is a type of short-stemmed leafy green. And while controlled growing allows year-round production and protects these new-age farmers from the vagaries of nature, they still contend with the possibility of crops dying from human error or technological malfunction.</p> <p>Rising from the middle of what used to be a dance floor is a gargantuan growing machine about 20-feet tall. The rectangular apparatus is a stack of growing beds, each about 20-feet long. It resembles a gigantic fridge missing its outer casing, but instead of being used to store greens, they are growing inside. Inhabiting patches on the seven-tier machine, are leafy greens of all ages: seedlings, shoots and fully grown plants. Freshly minted leaves fluttering gently in an artificially conditioned breeze. </p> <p>Above each bed are columns of LED lights, bathing the plants in a sharp white glow. When plants photosynthesize they convert light of certain wavelengths into chemical energy, and store it for future use. This light does not necessarily have to come from the sun, Oshima explained.</p> <p>Under the bright lights the plants appear to be embedded in crumpled soggy blankets. The use of growing mediums other than soil is not unique to aeroponics; planting seeds in cotton has been a popular idea for many a school science project. In recent years a related technology called hydroponics, that uses water as a medium to grow plants, has caught on. But Oshima is quick to distinguish aeroponics from hydroponics emphasizing that their technology is superior. And the key to the technology, is what happens under the microfleece membrane. If peeled it would reveal bare roots enveloped by nutrient-rich mist.</p> <p>Farming in artificially created conditions is itself not an entirely novel idea. Similar techniques are used in extreme environments where growing food the traditional way is not possible, including the <a href=\"http://ceac.arizona.edu/south-pole-growing-chamber\">United States South Pole Station</a>, where researchers live in a isolated hostile conditions for months at a stretch, and the International Space Station has its own space garden deploying a growing system called <a href=\"http://spaceflight101.com/iss/veggie/\">Veggie</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"f3df32f1080158de20894bb2ae9e50dfc650b3ef\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f3df32f1080158de20894bb2ae9e50dfc650b3ef/57_0_919_687/500.jpg\" alt=\"Breaking down the process.\" width=\"500\" height=\"374\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Breaking down the process.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The rationale for using similar methods in places where land has for centuries been tilled to grow food emerged at the turn of the century in response to urbanization and population growth. The world\u2019s population will <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/jul/29/un-world-population-prospects-the-2015-revision-9-7-billion-2050-fertility\">bloat to 9.7 billion by 2050</a> and 70% of people will reside in urban areas, according to the World Health Organisation. Using large swathes of land for growing food will not be an option, supporters of vertical farming argue.</p> <p>Dickson D Despommier, a microbiology professor and a top proponent of vertical farming, sees the agricultural technology not just as a response to food crisis but also as a means of returning land that was previously used for agriculture to its natural state.</p> <p>\u201cWe are just academics, we just sit here and watch these ideas grow,\u201d Despommier said on a podcast he hosts on urban farming, marveling at the scale of the new operation. </p> <p>AeroFarms has built its sales pitch to investors around more pressing and concrete concerns like land and water shortages, meeting the demand for locally grown greens, and climate change.

  "<p>Sadiq Khan, the London mayor, will announce a \u00a33m investment for 100 extra police officers on the night tube to reassure passengers and communities as the capital prepares for the launch of 24-hour underground travel next weekend. </p> <p>While many in London eagerly await all-night trains, which businesses expect to give an immediate <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2016/aug/14/night-time-economy-london-countdown-to-non-stop-city\">boost to bars and the entertainment sector</a>, an internal risk assessment leaked this year suggested that Transport for London was anticipating higher levels of rowdy behaviour and assaults. London Underground bosses said the public should feel confident in the safety and security of the night tube, and said they would be monitoring the service closely.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2016/aug/14/night-time-economy-london-countdown-to-non-stop-city\">Countdown to a non-stop capital: London goes 24-hour</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The phased move into 24-hour operation will start with trains running all night on Fridays and Saturdays on the Central line, the tube\u2019s main east-west artery, and the Victoria line, which runs from Brixton to Walthamstow Central. With trains roughly every 10 minutes through the night, TfL said nocturnal journeys would be 20 minutes quicker on average, with many passengers saving more than an hour.</p> <p>A test run took place over the weekend, with trains in service on the lines, but not carrying passengers. </p> <p>Khan said the night tube would bring great economic benefits for the capital and reinforce his message to the world, following the EU referendum, that London remains open. \u201cWhat better way to illustrate that than the tube running 24 hours a day,\u201d he said.</p> <p>The service would allow many more people to experience the city\u2019s culture, nightlife, theatres and music venues, Khan said.</p> <p>\u201cOver the last eight years we have lost, as a city, 50% of our clubs and 40% of our live music venues, and for the greatest city in the world, that\u2019s not sustainable,\u201d said Khan, suggesting that the night tube could help reverse this trend, while stating his intention to use planning laws to protect live venues and \u201cpreserve the heritage\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m also aware that thousands of Londoners work 24 hours a day: many doctors, porters or security guards take two or three night buses to get home,\u201d he said. </p> <p>In a reference to the delays in launching the night tube under his predecessor, Boris Johnson, Khan said: \u201cI\u2019m aware that the previous mayor set a date and broke his promise three times. By the end, he said we\u2019d survived 150 years without one and could do without it. He\u2019s wrong.\u201d </p> <p>The service\u2019s gestation has been fraught, with its <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/aug/27/london-night-tube-plan-suspended\">launch delayed by almost a year</a>. In what quickly came to be seen as a mistake, the night tube plan was unveiled by Johnson and transport chiefs, while burying accompanying \u201cmodernisation\u201d plans to cut jobs and close ticket offices. Any<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/may/24/tube-engineers-strike-vote-night-service-london-underground\"> union goodwill over rosters and work-life balance</a> quickly evaporated, and an agreed date to launch the night tube was only reached after Johnson\u2019s exit from City Hall.</p> <p>Finn Brennan, the Aslef union\u2019s organiser for tube drivers, said: \u201cHaving the new mayor in place who was clear about wanting to work with staff and unions certainly changed the atmosphere.\u201d </p> <p>Despite the progress, no date has been set for the three major other lines planned to follow in the autumn. Khan said: \u201cThe reason why I\u2019m phasing them in is I\u2019m keen to make sure that we don\u2019t have noise pollution, and that the buses are working in parallel and there are enough police. What\u2019s important is that we get the right processes in place.\u201d </p> <p>He admitted that there were already some problems on late-night weekend services, with more than 500,000 passengers using the tube after 10pm. \u201cObviously with more people using public transport, there\u2019s a legitimate concern over making sure we\u2019ve got enough police,\u201d Khan said.</p> <p>Noise from trains is an issue for residents, particularly those living along the outer reaches of the Central line. The mayor said there had been \u201ca huge amount of preparatory works to ameliorate disturbance,\u201d including upgrading tracks with shock-absorbent fixings to help deaden the sound. Station announcements will also be minimised.</p> <p>Despite the pitfalls and expenditure, with 500 additional staff having been recruited and revenue not expected to cover costs for many years, the economic prize, according to research by business group London First and services company EY, is high. It found that the capital\u2019s night-time economy already supports about one in eight (723,000) jobs and could be worth nearly \u00a330bn a year by 2030.</p> <p>But transport authorities are hoping, paradoxically, that the measure of success for the launch of the night tube is that passengers do not notice it. \u201cIt should be seamless,\u201d said Mark Wild, the managing director of London Underground. </p> <p>While there may be a touch of internal fanfare on the first service, as it pulls out of Brixton station on Friday night, commuters should not see any difference from day to night, with staff working as normal on the platforms. Usual off-peak fares will apply, and journeys starting before 4.30am will be counted as part of the previous day, meaning that many passengers could in effect travel free at night if they have already reached Oyster or contactless card daily caps. </p> <p>The missing five hours from the last train to the first are not a time when the tube sleeps, even now. Wild was speaking from the control room at TfL\u2019s Southwark HQ, which is staffed through the night, watching as maintenance trains run on the tracks, monitoring intersections of the tube and other rail networks, and ensuring that all those who go in come out.</p> <p>From here, on a bank of screens on the wall, every train\u2019s whereabouts can be monitored and every underground platform in central London clearly viewed via CCTV cameras. Police sit alongside and information is rapidly transmitted to anyone who could be affected by an incident or delay. The man at the hot desk is, one operations manager said, the \u201csingle voice of truth\u201d for information screens, news, phone apps and anyone following London transport. </p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ve already got eyes on the whole network and full control here, 24/7,\u201d said Wild. A returning Briton, Wild ran the transport system in Melbourne and helped introduce weekend night services on the city\u2019s tram and train network earlier this year.</p> <p>While the size of the network and the passenger numbers are a fraction of London\u2019s, Wild said the move was transformative for the city and expected a similarly swift take-up of the service in London. TfL is confident of pent-up demand: the number of passengers travelling on the tube after 10pm on Friday and Saturday nights has gone up by 70% in the past 15 years. </p> <p>Even before the additional police were confirmed, Wild said the public should feel very safe and confident using the service. \u201cPeople should feel as comfortable using this at night during the day. I expect it all to be pretty normal,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Without the deadline of the last tube, Wild said, demand should be smoother and the rush avoided, while he played down the possibility of late-night passengers continuing drunken revelling in transit. \u201cEveryone knows the rules. Coming here from different jurisdictions, people here are very well behaved. They should feel safe and secure,\u201d he said.</p>",
  "<p>It\u2019s a commonly held belief among pro-gun advocates that more guns make us safer. On Friday, it came to light that one of the most famous proponents of this belief \u2013 John Lott, author of The War on Guns \u2013 had <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.rawstory.com/2016/08/nras-favorite-academic-john-lott-exposed-as-a-data-fudging-sock-puppeting-fraud/\">fudged his data</a>. This is no surprise to me. I know that, when you are being shot at, your first thought is to run away \u2013 not shoot back. Any claims to the contrary were always bound to be wrong. </p> <p>When I was 18 years old, a dear friend of mine \u2013 we\u2019ll call her Katie \u2013 was in the process of breaking up with an ex-soldier who had been sectioned out of the army and was a bartender at a strip club. One night, while he was at work, she asked me to come help her move the last of her things out of his apartment.<br></p> <p>We were at the end of the task, making the last trips to my battered red Subaru sedan when the boyfriend \u2013 we\u2019ll call him Mike \u2013 unexpectedly came home. He was drunk and angry and had the wild-eyed, blown-out-pupils look of someone who has consumed large amounts of speed or cocaine.</p> <p>\u201cWho the fuck are you?\u201d he demanded of me. He asked if I had been sleeping with his girlfriend.</p> <p>Katie told him to leave us alone and let us get out of there. \u201cI don\u2019t want to call the police and you don\u2019t want me to, either,\u201d she said.</p> <p>They left the room for a moment to argue in the kitchen. I kept putting records into a crate, my heart pounding in my ears and my hands shaking. I was worried he would try to hit one or both of us.</p> <p>Moments later, Katie exploded through the kitchen door, white as a sheet.</p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s got a gun!\u201d she said. \u201cRun!\u201d</p> <p>We ran out of there as fast as we could. I was halfway to the car when I heard the first gunshot. I hit the dirt and frantically scrambled along the ground, crab-walking to the open driver\u2019s side door.</p> <p>\u201cGet in the back seat!\u201d I shouted at Katie rather than having her run around the car to the passenger side and expose herself to more gunfire.</p> <p>CRACK! CRACK! Two more gunshots sounded and two windows on the car parked next to mine blew out.</p> <p>With wildly shaking hands that felt like slick, cold balloons, I jammed the key into the ignition and peeled out of the apartment complex parking lot, leaving a trail of hot tire rubber on the asphalt.</p> <p>Later that night, before the police came, Mike died by suicide. By then, Katie and I had filed a police report, meeting officers at the Denny\u2019s where all of us punk rock and goth kids and other misfits hung out at all hours of the night.</p> <p>I remember sitting and talking to the kind-eyed female police officer, still shaking, my hand wrapped around a boiling-hot mug of Denny\u2019s coffee, but still freezing cold. My voice sounded to me like it was coming through a tinny speaker somewhere far away. My chest ached from where my heart had lurched, then pounded wildly when my brain dumped adrenaline into my system.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>There was no feeling of \u201cexhilaration\u201d \u2013 just a cold, spent-adrenaline state of after-shock, a bitter acid taste in my mouth and the sick realization of how close I had come to dying.</p> <p>Too many people who shouldn\u2019t have guns in this country have not just a sidearm or a hunting rifle, but whole arsenals at their command. This is a fact. Sadly, <a href=\"https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/hicrc/firearms-research/gun-threats-and-self-defense-gun-use-2/\">as the evidence shows</a>, only a tiny fraction of these guns will ever be used for home defense. They are much more likely to be used for suicide or against a family member in a domestic dispute or they will kill or injure someone when they fire accidentally.</p> <p>Sadly, I think too many Americans believe what they see on TV, that when the powder ignites and hot lead begins to fly, everything will slow down into The Matrix-style slow motion and they will be able to magically dodge bullets and shoot fast-moving human targets with a marksman\u2019s precision. Guns are not toys. They are machines designed for the express purpose of killing. And the stories we tell ourselves about them making us safer are just daydreams that have little to no application in a real life-or-death crisis.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p>",
  "<p>\u201cI love polls. I love polls,\u201d Donald Trump told a South Carolina audience in December, while he was still one of many contenders in the Republican primary. But, he hedged, \u201cif they turn negative, I don\u2019t like them.\u201d</p> <p>Sure enough, Trump has been singing a different tune in the general election, during which he\u2019s mostly trailed Democratic rival Hillary Clinton.</p> <p>Even his moment in the spotlight during the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2016/jul/31/hillary-clinton-donald-trump-convention-speeches-america\">Republican national convention in mid-July</a> was cut short by the Democratic convention just one week later. Trump briefly surged to a one-point lead over Clinton soon after the RNC. But Clinton\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/03/trump-clinton-unpopularity-2016-election-prediction-winner\">convention bump</a> \u2013 which put her seven points ahead in polling averages \u2013 not only wiped out Trump\u2019s short-lived lead but built upon her previous dominance.</p> <p>The Guardian analyzed RealClearPolitics polling averages from three previous election cycles to look at what could affect Clinton\u2019s lead. How the candidates fare in the polls before election day may yet defy all expectation; this has been a tumultuous election season to say the least. But if history is any guide, Clinton\u2019s current lead hinges on her performance in upcoming debates, the ability to avoid (any more) scandals, and bigger-picture issues like the economy and national security, which are beyond either candidate\u2019s direct control.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <h2>The convention bump: what does it mean, and will it last?</h2> <p>Looking back at previous election years, it\u2019s not unusual to see both candidates rise in the polls after their conventions. After all, conventions are essentially pep rallies with loads of free press for each party\u2019s candidate.<br></p> <p>\u201cThe candidate is the center of attention and the center of profuse praise for several days,\u201d said Scott Keeter, senior survey adviser at Pew Research Center. Candidates also usually benefit from increased party unity, as infighting left over from the primary race tends to slow by the convention, Keeter said.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>One candidate getting a bigger and longer lasting convention bump is also not unusual. But who comes out with the bigger net gain from conventions doesn\u2019t necessarily predict who will win in November.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4973953ddd50ebb2574f0b90c441fc309de3a2bc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4973953ddd50ebb2574f0b90c441fc309de3a2bc/0_91_3344_2007/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Hillary Clinton at the Democratic national convention.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Hillary Clinton at the Democratic national convention.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Timothy A.

After the Democratic convention, which was first that year, Obama seemed to rise about a point or two in the polls. But a big boost for McCain after the GOP convention the following week gave him about a two-point lead over Obama. In total, McCain got a net gain of about three and a half points but went on to lose to Obama in November.<br></p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/08/07/the-new-postabc-poll-shows-just-how-badly-donald-trump-blew-his-convention/\">nature of Clinton\u2019s gains</a>, combined with Trump\u2019s further stumbles in the past few weeks, could mean that her post-convention rise in the polls marks a <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/06/upshot/why-a-meaningful-shift-in-the-trump-clinton-race-may-be-at-hand.html\">meaningful shift</a> rather than a temporary gain.<br></p> <p>But even if Clinton\u2019s lead holds for the next few weeks, she shouldn\u2019t get too confident. Debates, gaffes, and unpredictable geopolitical events have all taken hits on even the most prolonged convention bumps in previous elections.<br></p> <h2>The candidates\u2019 next chance to shine: the debates</h2> <p>Clinton and Trump will go head to head on 26 September during the first general election debate \u2013 that is, if Trump decides <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/31/nfl-presidential-debates-schedule-donald-trump\">to show up.</a> The debate will be the next big opportunity \u2013 or at least the next planned opportunity \u2013 for the candidates to bask in the national spotlight and gain an edge in the polls.<br></p> <p>In the past, debates have had a big influence on the number of people who say they will vote for a given candidate. After the 2004 and 2012 convention seasons, both George W Bush and Obama were able to hold onto their convention bumps for a few weeks. (For Bush, his post-convention bump lasted about a month. For Obama, his numbers stayed high for two weeks.)<br></p> <p>But, in both cases, the candidates\u2019 poll numbers took a hit after the first debate.<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2016/08/polling-debates/\" data-alt=\"Charts showing poll numbers for Romney and Kerry rising after debate wins.\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2016/08/polling-debates/\">Charts showing poll numbers for Romney and Kerry rising after debate wins.</a> </figure>  <p>Despite trailing Bush in the polls for much of the fall of 2004, a majority of viewers polled thought John Kerry won the first debate. The candidates sparred over the war in Iraq for nearly two-thirds of the debate, and Bush\u2019s defenses appeared weak in the face of Kerry\u2019s persistent criticisms. Bush subsequently lost around five points of his polling lead.<br></p> <p>A similar scene played out again in 2012, between another incumbent, Obama, and Republican challenger Mitt Romney. Despite trailing in the polls, Romney was well prepared for the first debate, and Obama \u2013 often glancing at his notes \u2013 didn\u2019t perform particularly well. More than seven in 10 Americans told Gallup that Romney did a better job, which was reflected in post-debate polls when Obama\u2019s lead decreased by around three points.<br></p> <p>If Clinton\u2019s current lead holds up by the first debate in late September (which would be a very long post-convention bump indeed), her debate performance could once again change the balance of the race.<br></p> <h2>Economic or geopolitical shocks could move the polls</h2> <p>While it\u2019s easier to predict swings in the polls because of planned events such as conventions and debates, it\u2019s more difficult to forecast how unpredictable factors \u2013 including geopolitical shocks or economic slowdown \u2013 could impact the candidates\u2019 chances of victory.</p> <p>McCain\u2019s reaction to the financial crisis and his association with the outgoing president likely contributed to the collapse of his post-convention polling bounce.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2016/08/polling-economics/\" data-alt=\"Chart showing McCain's loss in polls after financial crisis comments.\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2016/08/polling-economics/\">Chart showing McCain's loss in polls after financial crisis comments.</a> </figure>  <p>The morning after Lehman Brothers collapsed, McCain, who was leading in polls at the time, argued that the economy was \u201cfundamentally sound\u201d. The comment caused an uproar. McCain was in the tough position of representing the incumbent party during a financial meltdown and was now on record saying things that further damaged his image. McCain\u2019s poll numbers sank the following week, and he wouldn\u2019t recover his lead again before that year\u2019s election.<br></p> <p>Signs of an economic crisis could particularly hurt Clinton, who has aligned herself closely with Obama\u2019s legacy.</p> <p>Questions of national security \u2013 terrorist attacks or foreign military conflicts \u2013 could throw greater uncertainty into the election, too.<br></p> <p>Security \u2013 and Isis especially \u2013 has been a central issue for both campaigns this year.

  "<p>Can topping the medal table in your chosen sport ever count as disappointment? There has been nervous talk all week at the Lagoa that Britain\u2019s rowers might be underperforming. Five medals does represent quite a step down from the nine Britain\u2019s rowers took in London, nor does it live up to the target of six to eight that was set by UK Sport before the Games began.</p> <p>On the other hand, four Olympic champions and a second place does not seem much reason to kick the cat. It certainly wasn\u2019t bringing down the performance director, David Tanner, who said an hour before the eights competed that if they both won medals, he would be happy with the team\u2019s overall performance.</p> <p>Standing on the pontoon as some members of the victorious men\u2019s eight were still bent over and puffing, he positively gleamed with joy. \u201cIt\u2019s massive,\u201d Tanner said, as he contemplated the achievement of the coach, J\u00fcrgen Grobler, in bringing home both the men\u2019s four and the men\u2019s eight as Olympic champions.</p> <p>\u201cNo other men\u2019s sweep has qualified three boats and we\u2019re one, one, four. It\u2019s exceptional and very tough to do. In rowing, six is always a challenging target. In Athens it was four, Sydney it was three. Nobody had got nine medals as we did in London since 1992. I\u2019ve said very consistently that that would be a very big stretch, with everything going your way. With things outside our control, it hasn\u2019t.\u201d</p> <p>Not one, but two illnesses in the camp have had a deleterious effect on the team. It has emerged that the men\u2019s single <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/12/great-britain-mens-four-olympic-gold\">sculler Alan Campbell</a> has been battling headaches and dizziness for the past two days, which went a long way to explaining his sudden fadeaway in Friday\u2019s semi-final. He was withdrawn from the B final here on doctor\u2019s advice.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"803c780488e2fd6d17cf30a3b5eeaf8ef55167f8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/803c780488e2fd6d17cf30a3b5eeaf8ef55167f8/0_98_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Great Britain wins Olympic gold in men\u2019s eight rowing.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Great Britain wins Olympic gold in men\u2019s eight rowing.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mike Egerton/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Meanwhile the men\u2019s quad, who had been expected to bring home a medal, were thrown into turmoil earlier in the week when Graeme Thomas contracted a nasty virus within 12 hours of landing in Rio and had to be sent immediately home. Jack Beaumont had to be flown out, and the repurposed quad managed only sixth in the A final.<br></p> <p>The team\u2019s bankers \u2013 Heather Stanning and Helen Glover \u2013 brought Britain\u2019s first gold in the women\u2019s pair on Friday, but not every 2012 champion fared so well. Katherine Copeland, who took gold with Sophie Hosking in the lightweight women\u2019s double sculls, failed even to make the final in her new partnership with Charlotte Taylor.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019d rather we had a few more in the A finals and in the medals,\u201d Tanner said, \u201cbut even the lightweights have their self-respect. In the case of the four that was better than they did last year, in the case of the double they\u2019re disappointed but they did a decent job.\u201d</p> <p>And there will have been relief at the medal success of Katherine Grainger and Vicky Thornley after what even Tanner admits has been \u201ca challenging year\u201d. Presumably nothing will have salved their high-profile dropping from the women\u2019s eight, and subsequent spat with the coach Paul Thompson, like the silver that now sits on their bedside tables.</p> <p>\u201cThere were certainly relationships that needed to be re-established,\u201d Tanner said, \u201cand I think hats off to everybody that they\u2019ve been highly professional and worked well together.\u201d</p> <p>Thompson came into these Games still facing a review into claims of bullying made by two former rowers. \u201cThere were comments that were made, you have to deal with it but this is professional sport, working life and he just got on with it and did the job.\u201d</p> <p>The eights\u2019 performances served as proof of just how wide and deep is the field of British rowing \u2013 as Tanner points out, \u201cit takes a lot of athletes to win medals in rowing\u201d \u2013 and there will be pride that all three women\u2019s open boats have now won medals. \u201cThat\u2019s the first time we\u2019ve ever had a women\u2019s eight on the podium, and they did it in style, even if they kept us guessing a bit in the first half,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a fantastic dynamic in the women\u2019s eight, some experience, some newbies, and a total good attitude and very good coaching indeed. James Harris is only 30, and it\u2019s his first Olympics \u2013 he\u2019s an outstanding coach.\u201d</p> <p>As for missing that medal target, it seems unlikely, on this showing, that missing it will have any severe consequences for the sport\u2019s funding.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s a matter for UK Sport to work out with us,\u201d Tanner said, \u201cbut I believe they would want to continue to back us strongly. We\u2019ve demonstrated over the years that we have a robust system. It\u2019s the colour of the medals that is most important. We\u2019re a sport that will prioritise everything to get gold medals if we can.\u201d</p>",

At least they had come away with some metal, even if the three\u2011time Tour de France winner could not surpass the third place he won in London, behind Germany\u2019s Tony Martin and Bradley Wiggins.</p> <p>However, British Cycling has always put more effort into winning indoors than outdoors. There are more medals available and it is much easier to control the variables in a velodrome. There are no idiot <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2016/jul/14/chris-froome-mont-ventoux-tour-de-france-2016\">motorbikes</a> to stop suddenly and crash into, no drunk fans to punch out of the way, next to no risk that a puncture or simple slipped chain will sabotage a solo breakaway. On the track you do not have to worry about freak hailstorms or stray dogs. If your rider is the strongest and is on the best bike with the best kit, you can win. At least that is what British Cycling always hopes.</p> <p>Britain\u2019s track cyclists have not performed brilliantly in the four years since London, particularly the men. At the world championships in March the team sprint trio of Jason Kenny, Philip Hindes and Callum Skinner finished sixth. Their female counterparts, Jess Varnish and Becky James, went only one better, which meant they would not be competing here, having been given fewer chances to race and accrue the necessary qualification points.</p> <p>That performance revealed cracks in British Cycling that threatened to open up a sinkhole-sized problem in what was once known as the medal factory. After failing to qualify for the Olympics Varnish \u2013 and, to a lesser extent, James \u2013 spoke out. \u201cI feel sick,\u201d Varnish said. \u201cWe have been basically playing catch\u2011up through bad decisions and bad luck.

It should be A team, A team, A team. It\u2019s not happened. This is through absolutely no fault of our own.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re fifth in the world, we\u2019ve beaten so many of the teams, this is the best we\u2019ve ever competed and we\u2019re not going to the Olympics.\u201d</p> <p>Shortly afterwards, her contract with British Cycling was not renewed. After brooding for a while, Varnish decided to speak out. After losing her funded place on the podium programme she told the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/apr/23/jess-varnish-british-cyling-shane-sutton-go-and-have-a-baby\">Daily Mail</a> that British Cycling\u2019s technical director, Shane Sutton, was sexist.</p> <p>He denies it, but the 25-year-old sprinter insists Sutton told her to pack in cycling and \u201cgo and have a baby\u201d instead. Her allegations kicked off a domino run of claims against Sutton, including, most damningly, that he called the para-athletes \u201cgimps and wobblies\u201d and referred to a non-white member of the podium programme as a \u201cdirty terrorist\u201d.</p> <p>Sutton resigned but last week said he was <a href=\"http://www.cyclingnews.com/news/shane-sutton-confident-of-clearing-his-name/\">confident</a> that an independent review would totally exonerate him. Whatever the outcome, he has been forced to watch these Games from his Manchester home rather than trackside, where he had stood for 14 years, inspiring and terrifying the national squad in equal measure.</p> <p>Before the Games began, some wondered whether Sutton\u2019s absence would lead to a drop in performance. The first two days of track competition suggested not. First, the men\u2019s team sprint <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/11/great-britain-mens-cycling-team-sprint-rio-2016-olympics\">trio</a>, not thought to be big Sutton fans, clinched gold, followed by another for the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/12/team-gb-bradley-wiggins-olympic-gold-mens-team-pursuit-australia\">team pursuit quartet</a> of Sir Bradley Wiggins (an outspoken Suttonite), Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doull.</p> <p>On Saturday morning Becky James breezed through her qualification round in the madison. Then the team pursuit foursome of Laura Trott, Elinor Barker, Joanna Rowsell-Shand and Katie Archibald broke the world record for the fifth successive time, putting them into to the final. On this evidence, British Cycling looks firmly back on track.</p>",

But it is the details that are most emotionally engaging, as characters cling on to their last vestiges of humanity: the moment, on realising the truth, when \u201cCharmaine\u2019s heart sinks\u201d; the moment her husband\u2019s \u201cheart beats like percussion under her fingertips\u201d; the moment a serial adulterer assures his wife \u201che\u2019s loyal to her in his heart\u201d.</p> <p>This visceral study of desperation and desire journeys into the dark heart of greed, exploitation and brutality, as it portrays a project that is \u201can infringement of individual liberties, an attempt at total social control, an insult to the human spirit\u201d.

  "<p>When Kate Mara was 19 she skipped college \u2013 a place at the highly respected <a href=\"http://tisch.nyu.edu/\">Tisch School of Performing Arts</a> at New York University \u2013 and bought a dog, Bruno, a Boston Terrier with one blue eye. \u201cI knew I would need the company,\u201d she says. \u201cBecause where I was going, I knew literally no one.\u201d</p> <p>Rather than remain at home with her big Irish family in New York, she was headed to Los Angeles to be a star. Fourteen years later, we\u2019re at the Broome Street General Store, a small coffee shop in Silverlake, to talk about her latest movie. But Mara\u2019s is not a sentimental story \u2013 it\u2019s about ambition. She was a painfully shy girl who loathed school and couldn\u2019t bear the thought of college. \u201cI look back and think, wow, that\u2019s how ambitious I was,\u201d she says. \u201cI was prepared to go through all that. But I\u2019m glad I did. It was worth it.\u201d</p> <p>Today, Mara and her arguably better-known actor sister <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/rooney-mara\">Rooney</a> are arm in arm on red carpets, A-listers both. But it was Kate, 33, the elder by two years, who first made the leap. Today, wearing a red sundress, she directs me to a shaded table outside. \u201cI\u2019m Irish,\u201d she says. \u201cI burn.\u201d She doesn\u2019t seem the carefree, sundress type \u2013 there\u2019s a steeliness to her; precise and clear, with an almost clinical intelligence behind the eyes.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWlJqsF_WVw\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/rWlJqsF_WVw?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>Ice queen: Kate Mara in her latest film, Morgan.</figcaption> </figure>   <p>As Zoe Barnes in <em>House of Cards</em>, she shone as the ruthlessly ambitious political reporter who stops at nothing until Kevin Spacey shoves her in front of a train. This part has made her a global name. \u201cI was just in London,\u201d she explains, \u201cand every time I took the tube, people would stare.\u201d In last year\u2019s Oscar contender <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/oct/04/the-martian-review-matt-damon-shines-stranded-astronaut\"><em>The Martian</em></a>, she was a computer expert in a crew of astronauts, a nerd among nerds. In <em>Morgan</em>, her latest project, she is excellently cast as Lee Weathers, an icy executive \u201cfrom corporate\u201d who has been sent to shut down an AI research project that has gone awry. The android (Morgan) has turned violent, and while the scientists who raised \u201cher\u201d (Toby Jones and Rose Leslie) insist that she ought to be given another chance, their heartfelt appeals bounce uselessly off Mara\u2019s pinstriped trouser suit and heels. She\u2019s so tough that, though it seems improbable at first, the petite Mara spends the last third of the movie in a series of brutal fight scenes, getting hurled through windows and suchlike.</p> <p>\u201cI got a lot of bruises,\u201d she grins. \u201cBut it was fun. I think when you have a tense movie like this, and you spend all day in a dark house in life-and-death scenarios, you become delirious. We\u2019d be crying with laughter at the most stupid things.\u201d</p> <p>In person, Mara is a good deal warmer than Weathers. When she learns that I, too, have a Boston Terrier, she coos over photos of the dog on my phone. She\u2019s not a reclusive celebrity. They know her here at the general store; regulars come up to say hello, and she\u2019s often seen walking her dogs with her boyfriend, the British actor Jamie Bell. \u201cIt\u2019s really therapeutic,\u201d she says.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"576f59ee2859c588672a6921de94cf403795f8ed\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/576f59ee2859c588672a6921de94cf403795f8ed/0_86_1392_835/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Young at heart: in Brokeback Mountain (2005).\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Young at heart: in Brokeback Mountain (2005).</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Focus/Everett/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It wasn\u2019t fame that propelled Mara, unlike Bell, to a life of privilege \u2013 she was born that way. Her father and his siblings own the New York Giants (estimated worth $2.1bn), and her mother\u2019s side of the family owns the Pittsburgh Steelers (estimated worth $1bn). With sister Rooney she is one of four siblings who enjoyed an idyllic upbringing of football and church and huge family gatherings \u2013 her father is one of 11, and there are 22 aunts and uncles in all. She tells me they grew up about an hour north of New York city, in a suburb called Bedford \u2013 not to be confused with Bedford-Stuyvesant, where <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2015/jun/18/michael-lavines-best-photograph-biggie-smalls-notorious-big\">Biggie Smalls</a> grew up. \u201cHaha! No, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/martha-stewart\">Martha Stewart </a>lives in Bedford. It\u2019s a bit different,\u201d she says. \u201cMind you, she went to prison too\u2026\u201d Her greatest challenge growing up was remembering the name of the new baby at Thanksgiving. \u201cThere\u2019s always a new baby in our family.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>When you have a tense movie like Morgan, you become delirious, crying with laughter at stupid things</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>When they were young, their mother would regularly take her two daughters to Broadway shows and the movies. At nine years old, Mara decided she would act. \u201cRooney was different,\u201d she explains. \u201cShe explored other interests. Also, she was much better at school than me.\u201d</p> <p>She was successful even as a 14-year-old, with a bit part on <em>Law &amp; Order</em>, one of the tried-and-tested stepping stones for an emerging actor. But she says she learned a valuable lesson as a teenager: that if one door closes, maybe it was meant to be, because another will surely open. \u201cI was up for a part in <em>The Sound of Music</em> on Broadway, and I was completely devastated when I didn\u2019t get it. It was like someone died. And my mum said, \u2018It\u2019s happening for a reason, just wait.\u2019 And soon afterwards I got this part in <em>Random Hearts</em>, a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2008/may/27/obituaries\">Sydney Pollack</a> movie, which was incredible.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e4a4f639d079d92f27145d85ba2446d9cbe24f12\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e4a4f639d079d92f27145d85ba2446d9cbe24f12/58_179_3619_2172/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Picture this: In 127 Hours with James Franco and Amber Tamblyn.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Picture this: In 127 Hours with James Franco and Amber Tamblyn.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: C.Fox Search/Everett/Rex Features</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It stood her in good stead when she moved to LA with Bruno. Her fortunes turned slowly but surely \u2013 when she was 22 she got <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/brokeback-mountain\"><em>Brokeback Mountain</em></a>, playing Heath Ledger\u2019s daughter, a role that changed the course of her career. \u201cAt the audition, I didn\u2019t understand what a big deal it was to read for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/anglee\">Ang [Lee</a>, the director], so there was less pressure,\u201d she remembers. \u201cBut he was so gentle and quiet, it felt like he was rooting for me.\u201d She likens Lee to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/david-fincher\">David Fincher</a>, whom she worked with on <em>House of Cards</em>. \u201cThey\u2019re both very specific directors. Like, don\u2019t blink so much, don\u2019t raise your eyebrows\u2026 I crave that now, but making <em>Brokeback Mountain</em>, I didn\u2019t understand. I just thought I was doing a terrible job and I was going to be fired!\u201d</p> <p>Doors started to open. Movies like <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2009/mar/10/dvd-review-transsiberian\"><em>Transsiberian</em></a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/oct/28/127-hours-danny-boyle-review\"><em>127 Hours</em></a> got her name ever closer to the poster, and then <em>House of Cards </em>changed everything. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/fantastic-four\"><em>Fantastic Four</em></a>, where she met Bell, followed but wasn\u2019t all smooth sailing \u2013 widely panned, it garnered just 9% of positivity on <a href=\"https://www.rottentomatoes.com/\">rottentomatoes.com</a>, a hub of movie criticism.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the career of the other Mara \u2013 Rooney \u2013 was soaring. Twice nominated for an Oscar, she may have entered the business long after Kate, but she has arguably surpassed her in many ways. The rivalry narrative doesn\u2019t wash. \u201cI know conflict is more interesting,\u201d says Mara, \u201cbut honestly, I just feel so grateful that we\u2019re both living our dreams successfully and to be able to share that with someone you grew up with \u2013 it\u2019s really special.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1be9dda8d0caaddb337ea04c51875c74cadcc8df\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1be9dda8d0caaddb337ea04c51875c74cadcc8df/84_105_1747_1048/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sister act: Kate, left, with her sister and fellow actor, Rooney.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sister act: Kate, left, with her sister and fellow actor, Rooney.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Pace/BEI/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>So they\u2019ve never been up for the same job? They are both the same height, they look somewhat similar\u2026 \u201cWe would be the last to know,\u201d she says. \u201cOur agents would never tell us. So I don\u2019t think it\u2019s happened. But maybe there are producers out there laughing, saying, \u2018Haha, it happened yesterday and we hired your sister!\u2019\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s not as though Kate\u2019s phone isn\u2019t ringing. These days, she\u2019s preparing to shoot <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/dec/15/sam-taylor-johnson-chappaquiddick-ted-kennedy-thriller\"><em>Chappaquiddick</em></a>, playing the part of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/aug/26/edward-kennedy-chappaquiddick-kopechne\">Mary Jo Kopechne</a>, the girl who was found dead in Ted Kennedy\u2019s car in a canal after a party in Martha\u2019s Vineyard in 1969. \u201cMore politics after <em>House of Cards</em>,\u201d she says. \u201cBut don\u2019t ask me about actual politics. I hate what\u2019s happening in this country.\u201d</p> <p>She is also producing her first movie, <em>Mercy</em>, with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/ellenpage\">Ellen Page</a>, about the death penalty. \u201cI spend a lot of my time watching really depressing documentaries,\u201d she says. \u201cWhat confuses me is why the death penalty is considered the bigger punishment \u2013 I think being locked in a box for the rest of your life is worse.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2932b1d99e86f7f57fd3a9ecae6787253647e9b6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2932b1d99e86f7f57fd3a9ecae6787253647e9b6/32_131_2255_1353/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Two of a kind: with boyfriend Jamie Bell, whom she met while making the film, Fantastic Four.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Two of a kind: with boyfriend Jamie Bell, whom she met while making the film, Fantastic Four.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Matt Baron/BEI/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In fact, after this interview she might do some more grim capital punishment research. But there are so many other things to get to \u2013 it\u2019s not all about work. A dedicated vegan, she is an outspoken animal welfare advocate, working principally with the Humane Society. Her current campaigns include trying to save chimps in Liberia, putting an end to the dogs of the horrific Yulin dog meat festival in China and protecting the marine life of SeaWorld. \u201cHave you seen <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/mar/08/tilikum-seaworld-orlando-killer-whale-trainer-blackfish\">Blackfish</a>?\u201d she asks. \u201cThat movie destroyed me. I cried for weeks.\u201d</p> <p>And then there are her hobbies. Mara seldom finds a physical pursuit she doesn\u2019t like. For now, she\u2019s busy with ballet and boxing classes \u2013 she had to take them to prepare for <em>Morgan</em>, and now she can\u2019t give up. But she\u2019s also into ice skating. \u201cI don\u2019t want anyone to know!\u201d she laughs. \u201cI\u2019m all about looking for the next thing to be good at. Like, I\u2019d love to be a great tap dancer, too.\u201d</p> <p>That fierce ambition that brought her out to LA has mellowed. Some days, she\u2019ll just work out, read a script and then go to dinner. \u201cI don\u2019t know if I\u2019m getting much done, but I love it. When people ask, \u2018Where do you want to be in 10 years?\u2019 I just say that I hope I\u2019m still acting. Oh and kids, sure. Kids are compulsory in my family, anyway.\u201d</p> <p>She shrugs and gestures to the street, the hills in the background. \u201cI think what\u2019s changed is that I\u2019m home now. It took a while, but I feel like I belong here.\u201d</p> <p>Morgan<em> is released in cinemas on 2 September</em></p>",
  "<h2>Jon Bennie: \u2018There\u2019s a fascination with the hidden world which is much less well studied\u2019</h2> <p><em>Jon Bennie is an associate research fellow at the University of Exeter where he is working on a project to access the ecological effects of night-time light pollution on different plants and animals.</em></p> <p><strong>Could you tell me about what you study?</strong><br>I\u2019ve been working for the last five years on the <a href=\"http://www.exeter.ac.uk/cornwall/news/2014/title_417435_en.html\" title=\"\">Ecolight Project</a>, which is funded by the European Research Council. We started off really trying to look at artificial light and light pollution as a concern for astronomy and for the aesthetic enjoyment of stars, but now we\u2019re trying to find out about the ecological effects on plants and animals and the environment. It\u2019s being driven by the growing awareness of the extent of the problem. In Europe, 60% of&#xa0;people can\u2019t see the Milky Way and 88% of Europe experiences light-polluted skies.</p> <p>Light is critical to all forms of life \u2013 every plant and animal gets information from natural light cycles. Daily cycles control circadian clocks. There are bimonthly lunar cycles \u2013 a lot of animals have a different physiological response to a new moon and a full moon \u2013 and different seasons. Bud-burst in trees in spring and songbird breeding rely on consistent natural light signals which give information about time and location. Dung beetles can orientate by the Milky Way. If it is obscured over large areas, what does that mean for the animals that use it to navigate?</p> <p><strong>Why are you studying it?</strong><br>Humans are active during the day, but that\u2019s pretty unusual for animals; around 70% of mammals are nocturnal. We\u2019ve got 2,000-3,000 moth and butterfly species in the UK but only 60 are active during the day. We tend to think of things in a day-active bubble, but so many interesting processes and interactions happen at night. As we envelop ourselves in this luminous fog at night-time, trying to make the night more like the day, there are implications for a whole range of&#xa0;species. There are two aspects: the direct impact on wildlife in our towns and cities, and then the wider countryside which is affected by sky glow and the effect of fragmentation. We wanted to find out about this.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Seeing the difference in moth activity or owls\u2019 hunting patterns between a new and full moon is amazing</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p><strong>What have been your most important findings so far?</strong><br>The difficulty is trying to pin down the effects of sky glow. We know indirect illumination has effects on both plants and animals, and there is an increasing amount of research being done in this area, but there still aren\u2019t many case studies. We found that predatory ground beetles, spiders and some bat species (pipistrelles) group around streetlights, because they use the artificial illumination to gain an advantage while hunting their prey. We\u2019ve been looking at whether effects can<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/jul/10/sea-otters-global-warming-trophic-cascades-food-chain-kelp\" title=\"\"> cascade up and down food webs</a>. We found a direct effect of low-intensity light on the flowering of a few plants, which in turn reduced aphid numbers, showing that the light-based effects on one species can cascade to the species that feed on them, and we expect they will be able to cascade further than this.</p> <p>The challenge here is finding out at what level of the ecosystem these effects are occurring. We know that if we illuminate an ecosystem it changes, but every time we do an experiment we find a new response that we\u2019ve never thought of before. We\u2019ve been running this experiment for four years and even in the simple systems, unpicking the pathways is difficult.</p> <p><strong>What drew you to studying at night?</strong><br>I started off as an ecologist looking at plants and plant-and-insect interactions. Like most ecologists, I was out doing fieldwork during the day but it suddenly occurred to me that the majority of stuff is going on at dawn and dusk and during the night. There are challenges with studying things at night, but there\u2019s that fascination with the hidden world which is much less well studied. Most of the places people go to watch wildlife, such as African plains, are unusual places, with a lot of animal activity during the day.</p> <p><strong>What\u2019s challenging about working at night?</strong><br>If you want to study what things are doing in the darkness, you have to do it in the dark and that causes problems with simple things like writing notes, running equipment, that sort of thing. There are other issues with doing fieldwork in more urban areas; I\u2019ve had the police come along and ask me what I\u2019m doing a couple of times!</p> <p>We\u2019re dismantling one of our experiments that has been running for five years now, which was more controlled, with net cages. We\u2019re getting the last of the data from that at the moment. Our current study has been going for four years now and we haven\u2019t got any plans to stop at the moment. It sort of depends on whether we\u2019ve got the funding and people. We need a team to conduct the fieldwork and maintenance. We\u2019ve had three of us working full-time on the project, a technician and two researchers, but it can be difficult to get people to work on the project early in the morning and late at night.</p> <p><strong>Is it difficult to stay mentally alert at night, or does the quietness encourage contemplation?</strong><br>I think the stillness really helps me think, but more late at night than if I\u2019ve got up before dusk. I\u2019m more of a night owl than a morning person, so I struggle with the mornings sometimes.</p> <p><strong>Working at night, do you ever feel spooked or lonely?</strong><br>Yeah, absolutely. I think that\u2019s part of the fun of it. I grew up in Devon where I did a lot of camping and walking, and walking back from the pub in the pitch darkness without streetlights, so I\u2019m pretty used to being on my own in the dark. Still, you hear strange noises sometimes and you get spooked. I do feel safer out there in real darkness though, rather than in a lit town. I once had a run-in with a couple of angry badgers in the middle of the night. I was walking along and two of them exploded out of the vegetation near me. It certainly gave me a shock.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/aug/02/academics-brexit-research-peat-fears-eu-funds\">Academics feel blight of Brexit \u2013 from cancer research to peat projects</a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong>Most people are asleep while you\u2019re working. What are we missing out on?</strong><br>Things like the quality of light in the mornings, the stillness. It\u2019s beautiful to hear the dawn chorus out in the open. The amount of wildlife activity that happens during the night is incredible \u2013 bats, owls, badgers, all the nocturnal species. Seeing the difference in moth activity or owls\u2019 hunting patterns between a new and full moon is amazing. You feel like you\u2019re more in tune with nature and can look up at the night sky without all the light pollution near populated areas.</p> <p><strong>What is the end goal of this entire project?</strong><br>We want to be able to find out about the effects of artificial light on species so that we can inform governments about how to lower the impacts of our lighting. Currently, lots of white LEDs are being used for street lighting, but they are actually blue LEDs with a white phosphor coating. This blue light affects a lot of wildlife much more than other types. We really hope to provide an evidence base which supports keeping important ecological areas unlit.</p> <p>The main steps that can be taken are split into four groups: reducing the number of areas that are lit; in those which are lit, reduce the duration of lighting; change the type of light being produced so that it has the lowest ecological effect; change the design of lights (eg shielding them so that they only light a very specific area) to make them more friendly to local species.</p> <p><strong>What could people do with their own outdoor lighting to reduce their effect on local species?</strong><br>People could make shields for their current lights, or buy lights that come with a shield attached. These angle the light downwards to a specific area, preventing it from spreading over foliage and therefore reducing the chance that it will impact creatures near your house.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d4942f742e122a73e3044ef810675f28a0110993\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d4942f742e122a73e3044ef810675f28a0110993/0_0_4368_2912/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Caroline Horton in her DrEAMSLab.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Old memories tend to crop up more often\u2019: Caroline Horton in her DrEAMSLab.<br></span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gary Calton/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Caroline Horton: \u2018The only problem is that sometimes people start dreaming about the lab\u2019</h2> <p><em>Caroline Horton is a senior psychology lecturer at </em><a href=\"http://www.bishopg.ac.uk/staff/Pages/caroline-horton.aspx\" title=\"\"><em>Bishop Grosseteste University</em></a><em> in Lincoln. Her research concerns sleep, dreaming and memory, with a special focus on how dreaming consolidates memories from our waking lives. She has set up a dedicated laboratory for studying dreams, called </em><a href=\"http://www.dreamslab.co.uk/\" title=\"\"><em>DrEAMSLab</em></a><em> (Dreams, Emotions, Associations and Memories in Sleep Laboratory), which launched in February 2016.</em></p> <p><strong>What are you studying?</strong><br>I\u2019m interested in how dreams improve memory. A lot of organising and reshaping happens when we\u2019re asleep. Dreams help consolidate memories by sifting through what happened that day, deciding what we can forget and starting to set things we need to remember into long-term brain structures. Everybody has dreams, whether you remember them or not, so as a psychologist they are fascinating.</p> <p><strong>How do you gather your research?</strong><br>Most of our studies take place in people\u2019s homes. In a recent study, we gave the subjects a Dictaphone and a programmed alarm clock, and asked them to record their dreams at four different points over two nights, to see how dreams changed through the night. But this year we\u2019ve launched the DrEAMSLab, where we can use electrodes to monitor people as they sleep. It\u2019s a small, cosy bedroom with blackout blinds and a computer, as some of our experiments involve asking people to learn something before they go to sleep. The only problem so far is people sometimes start dreaming about the lab, while the home is a more natural environment to collect data in.</p> <p><strong>Why are some dreams so strange?</strong><br>It\u2019s a common misconception that you only dream during rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. In fact, you dream all the time. Sleep is deeper in the first four hours of the night, and dreams in that period are shorter, and more mundane \u2013 you might dream about being at work, for instance. These dreams are reactivating memories from the previous day to see which ones need to be consolidated. During REM sleep, your brain is very active, so dreams become more complex and story-like. They can be bizarre because new memories are put into different contexts, to make them more memorable. Old memories tend to crop up more often \u2013 for example, you might dream about someone you saw on TV that night speaking in an office conference room you used three years ago. And because your brain is almost awake during REM sleep, those dreams are easier to remember.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>As a scientist, it can be tricky explaining our work, as people still associate dreaming with subjective art forms</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p><strong>Why do we have nightmares?</strong><br>People often dream of emotionally intense experiences from waking life, both positive and negative, because they\u2019re important to remember. Sometimes, our brain runs through potentially scary or dangerous situations, so we are better equipped to cope if they happen in real life \u2013 like dreaming about the gear stick jamming when you\u2019re driving, for instance. It\u2019s also about using our past experience to help us in the future. Before exams, people have a lot of dreams about feeling unprepared. And if you wake up feeling unprepared, you\u2019re more likely to get your head in the books.</p> <p><strong>Why do old places or people from childhood crop up in dreams?</strong><br>You\u2019re more likely to dream of life events that happened in your late teens and early 20s, as at that age you\u2019re experiencing a lot of new things \u2013 moving away from home for the first time, or your first relationship. You\u2019re at peak memory health when these are happening, and they can be emotional, so they\u2019re the strongest memories in the system and appear in dreams throughout your adult life, often combined with new memories. Don\u2019t worry, it probably doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re still pining after your first love!</p> <p><strong>Is everything we dream related to memory?</strong><br>The more often you record your dreams, the better you get at identifying which memory each fragment is from. I\u2019ve been recording my own dreams for years and have become very good at it. But some things do come up that seem totally random. If you\u2019re a creative person, like an artist, you\u2019re more likely to have more creative, fanciful dreams, while individuals who experience psychosis have much more disassociated, bizarre dreams.</p> <p><strong>Can we interpret our dreams?</strong><br>We usually dream of things from our everyday lives, and each dream is personal and unique to the dreamer. So I wouldn\u2019t advocate a \u201cdream language\u201d. As a scientist studying dreams, it can sometimes be tricky explaining our work, as people still associate dreaming with subjective, therapeutic art forms. Sometimes the answer is simple \u2013 people who dream about losing teeth a lot are probably just grinding their teeth while they\u2019re asleep. </p> <p><strong>Does cheese give you weird dreams?</strong><br>Yes, we think so. This could be because cheese is very salty and so can make you wake up earlier because you\u2019re thirsty, and so can catch you in the middle of a dream. But we don\u2019t yet know whether it affects dream content and the types of memories that are activated.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"41ee6f479d2db9c52dbff36a9882995ff51411cc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/41ee6f479d2db9c52dbff36a9882995ff51411cc/0_231_5439_3263/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Debra Skene and her integrating sphere in the Clinical Investigation Unit at the University of Surrey.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Debra Skene and her integrating sphere in the Clinical Investigation Unit at the University of Surrey.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sophia Evans/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Debra Skene: \u2018We know the value of sleep, yet we\u2019re often awake at night\u2019</h2> <p><em>Debra Skene is a professor of neuroendocrinology at the </em><a href=\"http://www.surrey.ac.uk/biochemical/People/debra_j_skene/\" title=\"\"><em>University of Surrey</em></a><em>. She studies the human circadian timing system and how it becomes disrupted in blind people, shift workers and older people. Her team\u2019s discovery that blue light from sources such as iPads can alter the timing of this system has important implications for how we&#xa0;sleep. </em></p> <p><strong>What are you studying?</strong><br>I study human circadian rhythms and sleep. Everything in our body is rhythmic, from the release of hormones to our behaviour, and we\u2019ve developed these circadian rhythms because we live on Earth, which has a light-dark cycle and a periodicity of 24&#xa0;hours.</p> <p>We used to think there was just one clock in the brain controlling these rhythms, but we now know that we have clocks in just about every tissue in our body. We are trying to understand how all of these clocks speak to one another and stay&#xa0;in tune, and how they are affected by time cues such as exposure to light or meal&#xa0;times. For instance, when we wake up and open our eyes each morning we get a direct feed of light into our brains, and this resets our internal timing system to be in tune with the natural 24-hour rhythm of earth\u2019s rotation.</p> <p><strong>Why are you studying this?</strong><br>So that we can help people synchronise to new time zones or shift patterns, and have treatment strategies for people whose circadian rhythms are out of sync. For instance, totally blind people can\u2019t synchronise their central body clock with the daily light-dark cycle, and the result is that they\u2019re essentially jetlagged a lot of the time.</p> <p>Also, we need to better understand how light exposure affects our internal clocks to ensure that we get the right amount of light to maintain alertness during the day and good sleep at night.</p> <p><strong>What are you observing?</strong><br>We measure people\u2019s mood, performance, sleepiness, hormones and metabolites [the products of the chemical reactions happening within our bodies] throughout the day and night, in order to understand which rhythms are truly circadian, ie generated by this internal clock timing system. This involves removing all of the external factors that could influence&#xa0;their rhythms, so volunteers are kept in a constant, semi-recumbent posture for 40 hours in dim light and at a constant temperature. They are not allowed to sleep, and instead of breakfast, lunch and supper, we give them small, hourly snacks. We wire them up so we can check their brain activity to see if they are falling asleep and we can wake them up.</p> <p>We also get people into the lab and deprive them of sleep, in order to understand what\u2019s happening in people\u2019s bodies during the first night of night shift work.</p> <p><strong>What do you find fascinating about your&#xa0;subject?</strong><br>All scientists are drawn to what we don\u2019t know. What currently most interests me is the link between the timing of our clocks and metabolism. We know that long-term shift workers have an increased risk of metabolic disorders such as type 2 diabetes and a tendency to be more obese; we\u2019re now trying to work out the mechanisms behind this relationship.</p> <p><strong>What are the challenges you face working at night?</strong><br>One of the biggest obstacles is getting people to stay awake during our experiments. At 4am, people are sleepy, but we can\u2019t go in and overexcite them because that might affect our results. Instead we have to walk in quietly and talk to them about some relatively boring subject. Everything is done in time isolation, so no one has access to what the time is, the internet or the wireless. Volunteers can watch videos, but it has to be from afar, so that the light on the screen isn\u2019t bright enough to affect their bodies.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>One tip is to be in bright light during the early part of your shift, and reduce light exposure near the end</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p><strong>Do you employ any special equipment?</strong><br>Another challenge we face is making sure everyone is at the same baseline when they come into the lab, and they\u2019ve been maintaining a regular sleep-wake cycle in their own homes. This is to minimise the variance between people and ensure that when we measure something, it\u2019s the effect of what we\u2019re testing and not the result of differences in people\u2019s circadian timing. To do this, we use actiwatches \u2013 small accelerometers worn on the wrist that record how much people have moved, which is a proxy for when they\u2019re active and not active \u2013 and ask all our participants to complete sleep diaries. The actiwatches also have light sensors, which tell us how much light they\u2019ve been exposed to and when.</p> <p>Our group is famous for showing that blue wavelength light has the greatest effect on the human circadian system. To do this, we had to put participants\u2019 heads into an integrating sphere \u2013 a reflective dome that bounces light around inside it, so that when you put your head inside it your entire retina is equally illuminated.</p> <p><strong>Is it difficult to stay mentally alert at night?</strong><br>We always work in shifts when we do&#xa0;overnight experiments, so one group works from the evening up until&#xa0;about 2am, and another does from 2am onwards. Generally you are so busy taking blood samples and spinning them down, or asking participants questions about how alert they feel that although you\u2019re tired, you stay awake. The other thing I\u2019ve noticed, which is generally common in shift workers, is that I love eating sugary things, such as&#xa0;biscuits or jam and toast, that I would&#xa0;never normally eat. We think that timing of unhealthy food consumption could be a key factor in the ill-health of chronic shift workers, although exactly why we crave these types of food at night needs more research.</p> <p><strong>Would you describe yourself as a night owl, or an early-morning person?</strong><br>I am a late type, so it is easier for me stay&#xa0;up quite late at night, which helps.&#xa0;One thing we\u2019re trying to do as a field is to identify people\u2019s chronotypes \u2013 their propensity to be alert at different&#xa0;times of day \u2013 and match this to their shift patterns, to see if this makes any difference to their coping with shift work.</p> <p><strong>Are you concerned about the effects of your working hours on your health or wellbeing?</strong><br>We always joke when we go to sleep conferences that we know the value of sleep, and yet we\u2019re often awake at&#xa0;night, so the irony isn\u2019t lost on us. I\u2019m&#xa0;also aware that when I fly across time zones, it isn\u2019t very good for my body either. It is something that you just&#xa0;have&#xa0;to do.</p> <p><strong>Do you have any tips for staying up late/managing the body clock?</strong><br>Try to take a nap before you go on to your shift \u2013 although the problem here is that in normal circumstances, when you\u2019re synchronised with the light-dark cycle, it\u2019s not easy to take a nap in the evening. Another tip is to be in bright light during the early part of your shift if possible, and near the end of the night shift, reduce light exposure. Also, we insist that everyone \u2013 volunteers and staff \u2013 sleeps in the lab and are fully rested before they go home, or they get taken home in taxis, so that there is no risk posed by them driving.</p> <p><strong>Most people are asleep while you\u2019re working. What are the rest of us missing out on?</strong><br>Normally, as a late type, I sleep through the dawn, but one of the great things about being a night worker is becoming much more conscious of it. It\u2019s nice and quiet, you can hear the birds, and that early dawn light \u2013 the sort you get even before you see the sun \u2013 I think that\u2019s a memory that sticks with you.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6dc9acfca8a1e6b0d0c4f6db3b90aa127d1e8554\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6dc9acfca8a1e6b0d0c4f6db3b90aa127d1e8554/0_442_5040_3024/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018They are so cryptic\u2019: Kate Jones at home with her bat- detecting equipment.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018They are so cryptic\u2019: Kate Jones at home with her bat-<br> detecting equipment.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Richard Saker/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Kate Jones: \u2018I\u2019ve been bitten, but never by a vampire bat\u2019</h2> <p><a href=\"https://iris.ucl.ac.uk/iris/browse/profile?upi=KEJON62\" title=\"\"><em>Kate Jones</em></a><em> is a professor of ecology and biodiversity at University College London with a special interest in bat research and conservation.

She lives in London. </em></p> <p><strong>How and why did you get into bats?</strong><br>My first contact was as an undergraduate, checking boxes with one of the professors in the North York&#xa0;Moors. He came down a ladder with a load of bats in his hand. There was one who was asleep and when he placed it in my hand it woke up and looked at me as if to say \u201cWhat do you want?\u201d I just thought that was so badass. That was it for me.</p> <p>I\u2019ve tried to avoid being a bat specialist as that can pigeonhole you. I try to look at the bigger picture, but always with a cunning eye on bats. They do so many weird things and so little is known about them \u2013 that\u2019s what really draws me to them.</p> <p><strong>What makes bats unique?</strong><br>They are so cryptic \u2013 they come out at night, but you don\u2019t see them. They are the only mammal that has proper power of flight. They can live for a really long time \u2013 up to 30-40 years \u2013 in the largest aggregation of mammals on the planet. They also host diseases that transmit to humans \u2013 Ebola, Sars. How do they host them and how do their immune systems cope? How have they evolved such a sophisticated system as echolocation?</p> <p><strong>What are some of the current conservation issues facing bats?</strong><br>Land-use change, such as deforestation&#xa0;and conversion of land for agriculture. Persecution \u2013 many people still view bats as pests or vermin&#xa0;and they lack legal protection in many countries. And introduced species such as snakes or rats. Bats might be slightly better able to cope than some as they can fly away, but they&#xa0;are attached to flyways and migration routes and it takes them a long time to recover from any population crash or disturbance.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I\u2019m not a big sleeper anyway. Sometimes it can drag a bit but lots of exciting things happen at night</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p><strong>How have bats been affected as society has become more 24/7?</strong><br>It\u2019s difficult to say \u2013 some species really don\u2019t like light, it interferes with their hunting. But the most common British species, pipistrelles, are drawn to lights because they attract the insects which the bats eat. Urbanisation could be more sympathetic, with less light pollution and increased habitat for wildlife.</p> <p><strong>Why are bats demonised? Is it because they are nocturnal?</strong><br>I think it\u2019s because maybe they are so secretive and cryptic by nature. There is the vampire thing that has been totally overblown, lots of negative media stories and preconceptions. There are 1,400 species of bat; only three are vampiric and they are in South America. It is a bit crazy.</p> <p><strong>Have you ever been bitten?</strong><br>I have been bitten lots of times, but never by a vampire bat and I do have a rabies jab. But I have been infected by <a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/fungal/diseases/histoplasmosis/\" title=\"\">histoplasmosis</a> \u2013 probably from when I was bat-tracking in Puerto Rico\u2019s hot caves. It\u2019s infection caused by a fungus found in bat guano. It has left a lot of calcified nodules on my lungs.</p> <p><strong>What sort of research do you do at night?</strong><br>Typically we would go out to a region or neighbourhood and train up local groups to use sensors and record the bat species. In Puerto Rico we spent a couple of weeks catching bats in mist nets at night to measure the impact of a recent hurricane. Or we\u2019d head out at dusk to do a walking transect survey, setting detectors and looking for roosts.</p> <p><strong>Do you get scared?</strong><br>I took a BBC team out to Hampstead Heath and they were all freaking out that it was the middle of the night, but for me it was completely normal. There are so many things to see after dark \u2013 bats, hedgehogs, foxes, owls, nightjars, crickets and cicadas.</p> <p><strong>Are you a night owl?</strong><br>I\u2019m not a big sleeper anyway. Sometimes it can drag a bit but lots of exciting things happen at night. When you\u2019re driving around different countries with sensor equipment stuck out the window, you can find yourself in strange situations where people think you\u2019re up to no good. We\u2019ve had guns pointed at us in Romania and Ghana.</p> <p><strong>Any tips for staying up late or managing the body clock?</strong><br>A nice shower in the morning usually sorts me out.</p> <p><strong>How does night-time work affect family and friends?</strong><br>Many are happy to come out for an hour or so. But staying out all night is beyond most people, and hardly anyone wants to come out for the dawn swarm at 3am. That\u2019s the worst part of the night \u2013 too late to be that day but too early to be the&#xa0;next.</p>",

  "<p>If you had to choose a dog breed to tie together themes of mortality, disease, depression and thwarted ambition, it\u2019s unlikely that the first to come to mind would be a smooth-haired dachshund. Chipper little hounds, with an inherently comic waddle, they are too upbeat to fit neatly into this portmanteau picture with its overriding theme of disappointment. And yet director Todd Solondz\u2019s gift for casting clearly extends to animals. The two dogs that combine to play the single central role manage to display exactly the tone of nervy, neurotic uncertainty that you would expect from the lead in a Solondz movie. It\u2019s something about the expressive anxious droop of the ears, combined with a gift for physical comedy that is a birthright if your legs are barely an inch or two long. This hapless canine serves to highlight the failings of the humans around it.</p> <p>Solondz cites as disparate influences <em>Au Hasard Balthazar</em>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2007/oct/10/features.features11\">Robert Bresson\u2019s </a>tale of a long-suffering donkey, and <em>Benji</em>, the tale of a plucky mutt who rescues two kidnapped kids. In its episodic structure, if not in tone, the picture also has something in common with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/jan/15/war-horse-spielberg-review\"><em>War Horse </em></a>\u2013 human lives are touched, albeit briefly, by a noble animal, although Solondz\u2019s approach is decidedly heavier on irony than that of Spielberg.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/jul/24/todd-solondz-interview-wiener-dog\">Todd Solondz: \u2018There may be a line I shouldn\u2019t cross \u2013 I don\u2019t know where it is\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The dog, renamed by each new owner, is the link between the four chapters in the picture. Her first human companion is Remi (Keaton Nigel Cook), a young boy who is recovering from cancer. His father, Danny (Tracy Letts, full of rage and hard edges), bought the dog on a whim. It\u2019s yet anothe r source of conflict between Danny and his wife, Dina (Julie Delpy), in a house that feels like an immaculately furnished war zone. The famous Solondz attention to detail is in evidence in the production design here. This is a home that screams control. Clean, cold surfaces, sharp angles; the way Delpy grimly disembowels the bread she is bullying into a sandwich while Letts spits his words as he deconstructs the concept of \u201chouse-breaking\u201d (house-training, as we say in Britain).</p> <p>Ultimately, it\u2019s the house-breaking, or lack thereof, that proves the undoing of the dog. Debussy\u2019s <em>Clair de lune</em> is one of the most overused pieces of music in cinema, but it\u2019s safe to say it has never before been employed to accompany a tracking shot that takes in the devastating aftermath of a dog\u2019s gastric emergency.</p> <p>The second chapter in the dog\u2019s life comes when she is granted a reprieve from a death sentence and nursed back to health by vet\u2019s assistant Dawn Wiener (Greta Gerwig). Audiences first met Dawn, then played by Heather Matarazzo, in Solondz\u2019s 1995 film <em>Welcome to the Dollhouse</em>. As with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/apr/25/life-during-wartime-review\"><em>Life During Wartime </em></a>(2009), which loosely revisits but recasts the characters from <em>Happiness</em> (1998), Solondz allows the new actors creative leeway in their interpretation of the original roles. But although Gerwig brings an awkward, needy charm to her portrayal of Dawn, there\u2019s not much, apart from the unflattering glasses, that links her to the younger version of the character.</p> <p>Dawn, we gather from her choice of shapeless, washed-out clothes and colourless demeanour, has been going through a rough patch. The dog, whom she rechristens Doody, makes her feel needed, makes her feel alive. And when after a chance meeting with her school boyfriend/bully Brandon (Kieran Culkin takes over the role from Brendan Sexton III) he invites her to come on a road trip, she accepts. Despite, or perhaps because of the quality of Gerwig\u2019s performance, this is the least satisfying chapter of the film. We are not quite ready to leave Dawn when the film does, when the dog is donated to Brandon\u2019s brother, who has Down\u2019s syndrome, to help him get over a tragic piece of news.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8C7OewoxnKI\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/8C7OewoxnKI?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8C7OewoxnKI\">Watch a trailer for Wiener-Dog.</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>Following a cute but slightly redundant intermission sequence, the story continues. The dog is now in the care of a film lecturer and former screenwriter called Dave Schmerz (Danny DeVito). Solondz approaches each story with his distinctive blend of cruelty and compassion, but there\u2019s an added layer of bitterness here that suggests a personal investment in his particular strand. Schmerz takes each student\u2019s screenplay as a personal slight; every success that isn\u2019t his own is salt in the open wound of his failing career. When he finally snaps, his dog is the visual punchline used to vent his frustration on all who fail to recognise his talent.</p> <p>The dog, now renamed Cancer (\u201cIt felt right,\u201d snarls the new owner, played by Ellen Burstyn), ends up as the companion of an elderly woman and plays a peripheral role in one of the most savagely effective scenes in the film. Granddaughter Zoe (Zosia Mamet) comes to visit her nana after a long absence. The unloved trinkets amassed over a lifetime sit in silent judgment, as Zoe stumbles through her repertoire of small talk until she finally gets to the point of asking for money. However great Burstyn is, it\u2019s Mamet who registers here as the dynamic force on the screen. She\u2019s flat-out terrific, and the most memorable element of a film that never quite matches the clarity of approach achieved by the similarly structured <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/mar/29/wild-tales-review-scabrously-satirical-revenge-middle-class-meltdown\"><em>Wild Tales</em></a>.</p>",
  "<p>Late-night radio has a kind of romance about it. We think of the DJ. A single light in a darkened studio. A lone voice into a microphone, musing, wondering, complaining, banging on. Riffing on obscurities, posing questions and unpicking answers. Perhaps playing a few choice tunes. But mostly talking, because talking is what\u2019s needed in the middle of the night. Talking, and someone listening to what\u2019s being said. Although what\u2019s often special about late-night programmes is that it\u2019s the presenter who is doing the listening, the listener, calling in, who speaks.</p> <p>There are a number of stations with a strong tradition of good late-night shows: LBC, BBC Radio London, TalkSport, XFM (now Radio X). Most big cities will have at least one, local, post-10pm programme that attempts to connect with an insomniac audience. But if you listen really late at night \u2013 after midnight \u2013 you\u2019ll find far fewer specialist late-night broadcasts than there were even 15 years ago. Budget cuts mean that local BBC stations can\u2019t afford to employ presenters, producers or engineers between the hours of 1am and 5am. Instead, they broadcast 5 Live or the World Service, or run repeats of programmes that have already been broadcast during the day. Commercial radio often runs shows across the entire network, rather than ones made especially by regional teams. You have to pay people to make them want to give up their sleep.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Late-night programmes can seem almost private. Show hosts will reveal more of themselves</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The internet, too, has changed things. Scheduling is less important than it used to be: a show can be put out in the UK at night, but listened to simultaneously by people in North America or Japan during their daytime.</p> <p>You can catch up with a programme at a time that suits you. Often people choose to listen to podcasts at night. Certain podcasts seem to be made for the small hours, such as <a href=\"http://loveandradio.org/\" title=\"\"><em>Love + Radio</em></a> and the longer-form interview shows. <a href=\"https://www.resonancefm.com/\" title=\"\">Resonance FM</a>\u2019s esoteric broadcasts seem peculiarly designed for after sunset, though almost all of them also go out during daylight hours. (<em>Sleeping Dogs Lie </em>is an exception: \u201cpresented\u201d by Miguel Santos, who doesn\u2019t speak, just plays purely ambient music, designed to get you to sleep.)</p> <p>Audiophile Ed Baxter runs Resonance FM. He says that daytime listening is \u201chalf-listening\u201d; we\u2019re multitasking, checking into a radio programme while doing something more important. But as night closes in, we stop doing so much. \u201cYou\u2019re lying in bed, concentrating on the sound, the intimate nature of the source material,\u201d he says. \u201cWhether or not you feel you\u2019re being directly addressed, it\u2019s always a bit like eavesdropping.\u201d</p> <p>Daytime presenting is a tame beast compared to its night-time counterpart. During the day, shows are geared around the hour, the half-hour; guests are vetted professionals; producers check details. Everything and everyone is on a tight rein. Breakfast shows, especially. Think of the <em>Today</em> programme, of any news-based breakfast show, the feeling that we listeners are being broadcast at, rather than to. There\u2019s a kind of pomp about such shows: if you visit them in real life, they are heavily populated by producers, experts, speakers. Busy, busy, busy. But with a night-time show, there is often only the presenter in the studio, and one other person manning the phones. Sometimes the presenter is completely alone.</p> <p>No wonder there\u2019s more intimacy at night-time. Late-night programmes can seem almost private. Show hosts will reveal more of themselves. Callers will tell all. We\u2019re into the lonely hours. \u201cThere\u2019s a vertigo of urban loneliness that late-night radio addresses,\u201d says Baxter. And the-late night phone-in, especially, seems to help. Regular callers become semi-celebrities, and speech becomes more free, less monitored. You don\u2019t have to have broad knowledge about a topic; you can just phone in because you\u2019re happy or sad or angry and want to tell someone (everyone) about it. We\u2019re listening.</p> <p>Many late-night shows have a pool of devoted followers: taxi drivers, factory workers, bakers, breastfeeding mums. They develop a relationship with their chosen show, whether or not they ever call in or make themselves known. As with podcasts, late-night radio is often listened to on headphones, as people work, or lie awake in bed, staring at the ceiling. The sound of a voice in your ear, telling a sad or dramatic story. Perhaps just being silly, teasing someone else for being daft. Or sympathetic, helping another human through a crisis.</p> <p>And the weirdest thing about listening to radio at this time of night? The constant pull of your mind towards sleep. Gradually, music and speech morph into ambient noise. There\u2019s a point when you\u2019ve stopped paying attention to what\u2019s actually being broadcast and instead you float in the sounds. Late-night radio might start off shouty or clever or crass, but it often lives most vividly on the threshold of our consciousness, looping in and out of our minds, a living dream.</p> <h2>Iain Lee: \u2018It\u2019s for the lost, lonely, battered\u2019</h2> <p><strong>Late Nights With Iain Lee, TalkRadio, 10pm-1am, Mon-Fri</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"164f4b7670a62cda01c5590fa81ea35993027fa1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/164f4b7670a62cda01c5590fa81ea35993027fa1/0_0_6609_4768/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Iain Lee at his desk in the TalkRadio studio\" width=\"1000\" height=\"721\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Iain Lee at his desk in the TalkRadio studio: \u2018I could be mean-spirited.

When Ian Collins was on LBC [he still is], me and Mackenzie Crook would get pissed and we would phone him up. One time, there was this guy who had auditioned to be Ronan Keating on <em>Stars in Your Eyes</em>, and he phoned up all upset because they hadn\u2019t picked him, they\u2019d picked a different Ronan Keating. So I called in and said, I\u2019m the Ronan Keating that was picked, I\u2019m the winning Ronan Keating. And there was me and this guy arguing about who was the best Ronan Keating for about half an hour. Ian Collins let us get on with it. It ended up with us having a sing-off. He sang a Ronan Keating song and then I said, listen to this, and sang a Ronan&#xa0;Keating&#xa0;song. And Ian Collins just said, well that\u2019s obviously much better, even though I was terrible. It&#xa0;was a joy.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Everyone\u2019s welcome on my show. I want to hear real people.

I\u2019d turned the act down to zero and they told me there was still too much personality in it. It broke my heart, to be honest. They had a guest on, a fitness expert, at 3 o\u2019clock in the morning, and I said: \u201cThat guy\u2019s awful, why do you use him?\u201d And they said: \u201cOh, it fills an hour\u2026\u201d</p> <p>My show is from 10pm until 1am and about halfway through we lose the daytime listeners and callers, and get the people on the fringes. I would say losers, because I\u2019m a loser, but it sounds bad. Everyone\u2019s welcome on my show. I want to hear real people having proper phone chats. I don\u2019t want the competent, the media-savvy. There\u2019s a real trend for radio presenters to say: \u201cCan I just bring you back to the question please?\u201d Whatever question they have, for the hour. I don\u2019t want that. I hate it.</p> <p>I asked for the slot I have on TalkRadio. I could have done breakfast or drive, but I didn\u2019t want that structure, the news, travel, the focus. When I do the show, I turn all the lights off. It\u2019s for the insomniacs, the people driving, working all night in factories. It feels different, it\u2019s a different vibe. I do try and create that. It\u2019s about allowing people to stay on for as long as they want, as long as they\u2019re interesting. If someone comes on with horrible views, I\u2019ll engage with&#xa0;them,&#xa0;explain why saying that is wrong and it\u2019s bad, be slightly&#xa0;combative.</p> <p>I used to love Tommy Boyd, Clive Bull, Mike Dickin. I\u2019ve taken stuff from them and from other people. Who do I like now? I sometimes listen to the <a href=\"http://talksport.com/the-two-mikes\" title=\"\">two Mikes</a> [Graham and Parry] on TalkSport even though I hate football; they do make me laugh. I quite like Cristo [Foufas] on LBC through the night, he\u2019s not afraid to have an&#xa0;argument.</p> <p>I give callers a lot of breathing room. We have regulars, perhaps more than most, because we\u2019re not a big show. I like the sense of community. Alan Caddick phones every day. The other night, we had a human moment. I said: \u201cYou don\u2019t sound yourself, Alan, are you OK?\u201d And he said: \u201cMy mum\u2019s ill, she\u2019s gone into hospital.\u201d And my mum has just been in hospital, so we had a moment. When I was on LBC, I used to take the piss out of callers; I could be a bit mean-spirited. I\u2019m more kind now. We have Nigel from Maidstone, he\u2019s legendary, this old guy who is obsessed with Miley Cyrus and Lindsay Lohan and he comes on and sing songs, and if he sings too loud, his mum will come and tell him to shut up.</p> <p>With regulars, it\u2019s a story developing over a period of years. We\u2019re a drop-in centre for the lost, lonely and emotionally battered. Not experts, with well-thought-out reasons. It\u2019s more like chatting at the bus stop or at a coffee shop, which is what I like to do&#xa0;anyway.</p> <h2>Hattie Pearson: \u2018I might be the only voice my listeners hear at work\u2019</h2> <p><strong>Radio X, 1-4am, Mon-Fri</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"98af4830c79674563efad1bd85441f8330bc74cd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/98af4830c79674563efad1bd85441f8330bc74cd/0_0_4368_2912/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Hattie Pearson at Radio X\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018There\u2019s nobody in the studio with me\u2019: Hattie Pearson at Radio X.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gary Calton/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It\u2019s like any radio job \u2013 you have to think about the audience you\u2019re talking to. <a href=\"http://www.radiox.co.uk\" title=\"\">Radio X</a>\u2019s audience at that time are coming back from a night out.

There\u2019s Phil the baker, Sammy the ambulance driver...</p> <p>With talk radio, phone-in radio, you might want to engage people by having a debate, getting them agitated enough to call in, but with me it\u2019s more about what do I want to share? I might talk about going to gigs at the weekend, sharing my experiences of that, talking around music in a way that\u2019s relevant to people listening. My show isn\u2019t a specialist show, it\u2019s play-listed \u2013 I get what I\u2019m given when it comes to music \u2013 but I think about the music we play, how I can engage with that. There\u2019s a different vibe. You can get away with a more eclectic mix. There\u2019s a flexibility at night \u2013 you can push boundaries a bit more. You\u2019re naturally more relaxed and in your own groove as a presenter at night. You\u2019re in control.</p> <p>Social media is instantaneous, so you\u2019re able to engage more because there\u2019s no boss there\u2026 I mention people on air, I reply to tweets. There\u2019s less volume, everyone feels more involved and valued, and I do too. Everyone knows it\u2019s weird to be up at that time. I might be the only voice they hear at work.</p> <p>I don\u2019t have a producer in the studio with me. I work in Manchester, and there\u2019s nobody there with me. I unlock the door, deactivate the alarm and let myself in, and then, when I\u2019ve finished, I set the alarm and go out. I don\u2019t see anyone. Sometimes, when I come over to do the odd show during the day, or some work, I\u2019m like, oh my God, there are people in the office!</p> <p>I get to bed at 5am and I\u2019m up at lunchtime. I used to do 3-7am at the weekends and I found it a lot tougher. You lose your weekend completely. I like working at this time. I get there an hour and a half before the show, and in the afternoons I walk the dog, go to the gym, I have meetings. The only thing is I get that Sunday feeling really early, at Sunday lunchtime. But I get Friday afternoons. Friday\u2019s like a day off for me. I actually think my slot is one of the best.</p> <h2>Pete Price: \u2018I often go mad with people, I\u2019ll cut them off\u2019</h2> <p><strong>Late Night City, Radio City Talk Liverpool, 10pm-1am, Sun-Thurs</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"884853361e8c7d6380b2d9f6ffab3647a595ee0f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/884853361e8c7d6380b2d9f6ffab3647a595ee0f/0_0_4368_2912/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Pete Price\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Pete Price: \u2018I was a standup for years, so I can go with the flow, I can argue back.

I\u2019ve travelled a lot for work, and when you\u2019ve been to other places in the world, you really know how much freedom we have here. I always say: \u201cYou have free speech, use it! Call up, say what\u2019s on your mind!\u201d</p> <p>I\u2019ve had a lot of radio shows in my time. I had a feature in a show that was a dating feature, called Evening Encounters \u2013 one of the first ones ever on radio. People would call up looking for love. There was one guy who called in from the Wirral, he loved his gnomes. \u201cI\u2019ve got 45 of them,\u201d he said. \u201cI love every single one of them. Love me, love my gnomes.\u201d Anyway, I asked him to tell the listeners what he looked like. \u201cI\u2019m five foot,\u201d he said. And I said: \u201cDon\u2019t tell me you\u2019ve got a little red hat and a fishing rod!\u201d and he put the phone down on me. We carried on, and I talked to the next caller. She said: \u201cThat last guy. Do you think he was gnome-osexual?\u201d That\u2019s what I love about radio.</p> <p>I was a standup for years, so I can go with the flow, I can argue back. I often go mad with people, I\u2019ll cut them off. Late-night talk radio is like a confessional and I\u2019m the priest.</p> <p>I\u2019m gay, I\u2019m adopted, my mum died, I\u2019ve had struggles in life, I\u2019ve been through every pain you have except for childbirth. And I\u2019ll talk about it all. I\u2019ll talk about anything on air. Except football. I hate the way football\u2019s changed, how it\u2019s about money now and not passion. And the way it divides people, how abusive they get.</p> <p>I think about the show all day. It\u2019s all planned, but when the mic goes live, anything can happen. We\u2019ll have questions and interviewees. I know a lot of celebs: my autobiography is called <em>Pete Price: Namedropper.</em> I\u2019ll just call them up and have a chat. Sharon Osborne is a mate, Paul O\u2019Grady will often call if he\u2019s in Liverpool. He\u2019ll be feeding the lambs and think, I must ring Pricey. We have the \u201cpeaceful hour\u201d at midnight, but if something breaks on the news, then we have to react. We have to go with it.</p> <p>I know what the show can mean to people because they tell me. Sometimes it\u2019s overwhelming, like with the James Bulger case. People phoning in, saying: \u201cI think I saw them when I was on the bus, I saw them walking along the street, I could have stopped them, I can\u2019t live with myself.\u201d</p> <p>I once walked out in the middle of a show in 2004 because a young lad called Michael phoned in saying he was going to kill himself. He was 12. Off air, I said to him: \u201cIf I come and see you, would you stop what you\u2019re gonna do?\u201d And he said: \u201cYou\u2019d never come.\u201d And I said: \u201cI would.\u201d And I left the studio and I drove to his road. I said to my producer, I\u2019ve got to go, you can\u2019t stop me. I called the police on the way, because I didn\u2019t know if it was a set-up \u2013 I\u2019m a known gay man, he was 12. I saw him and got him in the car. I was driving him to the hospital and one of the police rang to see if he was all right. So I picked up his call and Michael said: \u201cYou know it\u2019s illegal to talk on the phone while you\u2019re driving!\u201d I went, \u201cI\u2019ve just saved your life, you little shit!\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>You can get your problems off your chest, you don\u2019t have to go to bed with them, you can speak to me instead</p> <footer> <cite>Pete Price</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Social media has made phone-ins more difficult. Some people don\u2019t call because they can tweet or text instead. I don\u2019t like texting on my phone. It drives me mad, but we tweet during the show. There\u2019s only me and my producer, we don\u2019t have a big team. People are lazy and it takes two seconds to tweet. When we ring them back to have a chat, they get impatient even though we\u2019re paying for the call. No one wants to wait.</p> <p>There was one lady who called, a bit ago. Her husband died and she was distraught. I talked to her and made her get one of his suits from the wardrobe and sleep next to it. And the next day I got the most beautiful bouquet of flowers from her daughters, and a note saying that I\u2019d saved her life the night before.</p> <p>To anyone reading this, I would say, please don\u2019t waste your opportunity to call in. We are the luckiest people alive, in this country. You can get your problems off your chest, you can talk about them, you don\u2019t have to go to bed with them, you can speak to me instead, share it, whether it\u2019s political, medical, anything. Talk to me. I can\u2019t emphasise it enough, we are so lucky to have freedom of speech. Look at Turkey! We\u2019re so lucky and we shouldn\u2019t take it for granted. It\u2019s the most incredible tool.</p> <h2>Dotun Adebayo: \u2018I\u2019m happy to give out my personal phone number\u2019</h2> <p><strong>Up All Night, BBC Radio 5 Live, 1-5am, Thurs-Sun</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d333447e6ead463e0c8f9851b634b892ac19bcdc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d333447e6ead463e0c8f9851b634b892ac19bcdc/0_368_3840_2304/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Dotun Adebayo\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dotun Adebayo: \u2018Our priority is news.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: BBC/Jon Super</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I\u2019m the default late-night listen, which means we can\u2019t realistically just feature ranting and raving callers. If you\u2019re not watching telly, then we\u2019re what you\u2019re listening to for breaking stories, and we never forget that. The World Service is more on an international scale, we\u2019re the national news. We\u2019re the first point of call, the messenger, we have to get the message across.</p> <p>So our priority is news. We do a world football phone-in on a Friday night and we had to abandon it for two weeks running because of atrocities: first Nice, then Turkey. We have fans all over the world and some of them got it, and some didn\u2019t. We got lots of: \u201cWe\u2019ve got to suffer because of something we can\u2019t control.\u201d</p> <p>We embrace some of that call conversation. I\u2019m happy to give out my personal phone number to certain callers. The other week, I was talking about my daughter\u2019s English A-level. She studied <em>Macbeth</em> and I said to her: \u201cAny question about <em>Macbeth </em>can be answered with this: it\u2019s an argument between existentialism and determinism. Is Macbeth ruled by fate or is he the maker of his own destiny? Does he have to follow what\u2019s determined in advance?\u201d Anyway, we got a lot of texts about it, and they carried on after the programme ended. I replied to them from my phone by text, because I think if you\u2019ve taken the trouble to think about the topic and send in a question, then you\u2019re part of my extended family.</p> <p>I\u2019m a Londoner through and through, but I have to live in Manchester for the show, so I live in the rear end of Salford in a \u00a390-a-week flat. A one-bedroom place. I\u2019m half-Mancunian now. There\u2019s a gym at the bottom of my tower block and I go after the show for two hours.</p> <p>When I started the late-night show, when it was still in London, I thought it was the perfect opportunity. I had two young children and I\u2019d come in to 5&#xa0;Live every night after they went to bed. I come in at 9pm to go on for 1am and then I got home by 5.30am to see them get up. They never missed me. But now they\u2019re older, and so am I, and emotionally it\u2019s much more difficult.</p> <p>When I started there was a production team of five; now it\u2019s a team of two, a senior producer and a broadcast journalist as well as me. You can only do that job if you\u2019re a really excellent journalist. You\u2019re forced to react, to respond in the middle of the night to a press conference from Barack Obama that you thought was a five-minute thing on the economy and turns out to be him announcing: \u201cWe have shot dead Osama bin Laden.\u201d You have to find commentators from all over the world in the middle of the night.</p> <p>Social media has totally changed the job. The traditional advantage that radio has over TV, that we can be more immediate, that we can be on air in 30 seconds\u2026 well, social media is even more immediate. We can be more in-depth than 140 characters, though. Also, for my other show, a black-interest programme on BBC London. The other day we had five guests booked on the subject of Black Lives Matter and not one could make it. All five dropped out with hours to spare. So we went on Twitter and tweeted people who had been tweeting about Black Lives Matter and five people got back and we used three of them. We got new voices.</p> <p>A late-night programme is a unique form of radio. There\u2019s no one anywhere in the country that does what we do. One in five people listening at that time of night are listening to me. We might not get the same figures as breakfast shows, but in terms of market share, we\u2019re the boss.</p>",
  "<p>Soon after my husband and I started homeschooling our three children, it became clear that it wasn\u2019t going to work in the conventional way. There was too much tension between us as the teachers, and them as the learners.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/teacher-network/2016/may/19/extreme-distance-learning-home-schooling-wild\">Extreme distance learning: a look at home-schooling in the wild</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Everything changed when we decided to step back and let them lead the learning process themselves. This was when we began a using a method known as unschooling, which allows the children to be in control while we support them. When we tell people this, the reactions vary from: \u201cWow, that sounds wonderful!\u201d to \u201cHow will your children learn anything?\u201d</p> <p>With our children, it is clear that they do learn \u2013 they just might not do it in the way that people are used to. If they enjoy what they\u2019re doing, they go through big learning curves as they are driven to gather information. Learning happens quickly when there is a need to know something.</p> <h2>Independent learning</h2> <p>Reading is a good example. One of my children really struggled and I initially followed her around, trying to help. One day she politely asked me to leave her alone. </p> <p>I stepped away from helping her when she was about 10, which was hard as I had to have faith that she would learn on her own. But about six months later she was reading. She\u2019s now 13 and reading is an absolute joy for her \u2013 I can\u2019t keep up with the speed at which she gets through novels. She learned to read in her own way. I told her what the words were if she asked me, but other than that it was completely her process. </p> <p>Our children choose what they want to do each day. That could be reading books, cooking, drawing, writing, playing games on the computer, listening to music, watching movies, or learning circus skills.</p> <p>One time, our daughter decided to make a film and worked through the entire process herself. This was a great opportunity to learn about storytelling, writing, filmmaking, props, acting, directing, costume-making and working with actors (albeit small ones). She was able to work with a friend of ours who is a documentary maker and told her all about how to line up good shots. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/apr/12/home-schooling-parents-education-children-england\">DIY schooling on the rise as more parents opt for home education</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Last summer, our son wanted to write and illustrate a book. He dictated it, I typed. He loved doing it and now plans to sell it online. Meanwhile, our twin daughters both like history projects, so they have researched characters from history and dressed up as them \u2013 Emily Earhart, Cleopatra, and Emmeline Pankhurst, to name a few. When researching Georgian make-up, I helped them go on Twitter to talk to a fantastic historian who told them all about how Georgian lipstick was made.</p> <h2>Emotional intelligence</h2> <p>We don\u2019t pressure the children to stay on task if what they are doing is becoming a chore. The enjoyment and engagement has probably gone out of the project by then and therefore they won\u2019t be learning. This is not to say that we shy away from supporting them through the challenges of learning, but they learn things because they want to. It is important to be emotionally intelligent, inventive and able to initiate projects themselves. </p> <p>A common criticism is that this is a lazy approach, but it\u2019s far from it. Being with a child in the learning process requires focus, commitment, energy and faith in their abilities. </p> <p>Another myth is that unschoolers don\u2019t have friends and struggle to socialise. In our case, the children go to circus classes where they meet other young people. We\u2019re also part of an online Skype project which introduces groups of children from small villages in India. They connect with friends and play Minecraft whilst chatting online. What\u2019s more, we arrange for visitors of all ages to come and share their skills with them. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/oct/08/how-i-stayed-normal-when-homeschooled-i-watched-a-lot-of-tv\">How did I stay normal when I was home-schooled?

  "<p>In the same way the statue of Christ the Redeemer dominates the Rio skyline so Michael Phelps now transcends his sport. It did not require one final gold medal in the 4x100 medley relay \u2013 his 23rd gold and 28th Olympic medal \u2013 to reinforce his status as the most decorated Olympian of all time but he delivered it anyway. The outstretched arms of Phelps will encourage swimmers to aim higher for as long as there is water on the surface of the earth.</p> <p>The chances of any other male athlete from any sport eclipsing Phelps\u2019s tally are not so much remote as inconceivable. Maybe the remarkable Katie Ledecky, still only 19, will edge into similarly rarified territory but she will have to dig extraordinarily deep over the next dozen years to do so. The phenomenal Phelps has taken the art of winning to a level beyond the average human imagination.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/14/mack-horton-and-campbell-sisters-miss-out-on-olympic-medals-in-swimming\">Australian swim team finish on relay high after early disappointments</a> </p> </aside>  <p>His 23rd gold medal also took him to a personally significant mark; his great hero Michael Jordan always wore that number for the Chicago Bulls. \u201cTwenty-three is a special number,\u201d he admitted. \u201cIt always has been and now it\u2019ll be even more special. I guess everything happens for a reason. Watching what he did in basketball is something I\u2019ve always dreamed of doing in the sport of swimming.\u201d It made his last competitive Olympic swim all the more satisfying. \u201cIt\u2019s just the perfect way to finish. This is the cherry on the top of the cake that I wanted. I couldn\u2019t be happier with the way things ended.\u201d</p> <p>His long time coach Bob Bowman is already convinced there will never be another swimmer quite like him. \u201cAbsolutely not. I\u2019m not even looking. He\u2019s too special. It\u2019s not even once in a generation. It might be once in 10 generations that someone like Michael comes along. I don\u2019t think you\u2019re going to be seeing another Michael.\u201d</p> <p>It certainly feels surreal to anyone brought up on American swimming greats such as Mark Spitz and Matt Biondi that the retiring champion will depart with more golds than his two closest pursuers combined. Yes, swimming affords plenty of podium opportunities but that should theoretically give his rivals more chances to unseat him in some of his less specialist disciplines. Their inability to do so tells its own recurring story.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/video/2016/aug/14/mo-farah-takes-10000m-gold-video-highlights\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/4qn8g\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2654521\"            data-video-name=\"Farah retains 10,000m title, Phelps wins 23rd Olympic gold \u2013 video highlights\"            data-video-provider=\"BBC\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-57b00ebae4b0178756b5c803\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/ukonly/mainwebsite/2016/08/14/OlympichighlightsSunday3_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/ukonly/webM/2016/08/14/OlympichighlightsSunday3_V6.webm\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/ukonly/HLS/2016/08/14/OlympichighlightsSunday3.m3u8\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/video/2016/aug/14/mo-farah-takes-10000m-gold-video-highlights\">Farah retains 10,000m title, Phelps wins 23rd Olympic gold</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>The last hurrah was typical Phelps: the menacing hoodied, headphoned entry followed by the almost inevitable golden outcome, a shared Olympic record and a familiar podium salute. He was more emotional than usual before the race, however, as his team-mate Ryan Murphy later confirmed; \u201cYou could see the tears in his eyes as we were walking over to the medal ceremony. He was super emotional. If this is the end for him that was a great way to cap off an incredible career. He\u2019s opened a lot of doors for all of us. Whoever you swim for, you\u2019re indebted to Michael Phelps.\u201d</p> <p>The 31-year-old, who has also won the 200m butterfly and 200m individual medley, along with the 4x100m and 4x200m freestyle relays \u2013 he won silver in the 100m butterfly \u2013 has also looked a far more contented athlete in Rio; fatherhood clearly suits him yet his competitive urge remains undimmed. While Great Britain\u2019s James Guy did well to hold him in check during the butterfly leg, there was never much doubt the US would take gold.</p> <p> With the women\u2019s 4x100 medley relay team also winning gold, it was another satisfying night for the American team at the end of another productive week. Amid all the American back-slapping, though, GB\u2019s silver medal effort did contain one remarkable statistic. Adam Peaty\u2019s split time for his 100m breaststroke leg was a staggering 56.59, well under the mythical 57-second barrier and almost half a second quicker than his world record time set earlier this week en route to individual gold.</p> <p>Even Phelps was impressed. \u201cHe was swearing and said \u201856.5 is mad\u2019,\u201d revealed Peaty. \u201cHe was pretty impressed. Looking at the TV as a kid you never think you\u2019d impress Michael Phelps with all those golds round his neck.\u201d</p> <p>It will give the GB team further reason to fly home suitably encouraged about the future. \u201cI was a man on a mission,\u201d said Peaty. \u201cA lot of people have been saying I couldn\u2019t do it but I took over half a second off it. Hopefully that\u2019s a message for the rest of the world in four years time. We\u2019re looking at a very good relay coming together.\u201d</p> <p>It was also an emotional outcome for Chris Walker-Hebborn who has been competing while coping with the recent news that his father, Andy, has been diagnosed with cancer. There was a less soothing outcome for Fran Halsall who finished an agonising fourth in her 50m freestyle final, leaving her just outside the medals for the third Games in succession. Even a season\u2019s best time of 24.13 secs was not quite enough in a desperately tight race, with the Danish winner Pernille Blume clocking 24.07 and Belarus\u2019s Aliaksandra Herasimenia winning bronze in 24.11.</p> <p>Halsall, who was leading halfway down the pool, could not hide her disappointment afterwards. \u201cIt\u2019s disappointing not to come away with the result I wanted but it just didn\u2019t work out on the day. It was a season\u2019s best...my best performance of the whole year, in an Olympic final. You can\u2019t do much more than that really. It\u2019s just that other people on the day were a bit better than me.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>My eye was caught by an interesting \u201cscoop\u201d in last Saturday\u2019s <em>Daily Telegraph</em>: \u201c<a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/08/05/bbc-to-deploy-detection-vans-to-snoop-on-internet-users/\" title=\"\">BBC to deploy detection vans to snoop on internet users</a>,\u201d screamed the headline. \u201cThe BBC is to spy on internet users in their homes,\u201d the report began, \u201cby deploying a new generation of Wi-Fi detection vans to identify those illicitly watching its programmes online. The <em>Telegraph</em> can disclose that from next month, the BBC vans will fan out across the country capturing information from private Wi-Fi networks in homes to \u2018sniff out\u2019 those who have not paid the licence fee.\u201d</p> <p>Scary, eh? Before you reach for your tinfoil hat, though, some background might be helpful. First is the standard health warning: anything written about the BBC in the <em>Telegraph</em>, Murdoch newspapers or the <em>Daily Mail </em>has to be read in the context of those publications\u2019 visceral hatred of the BBC and everything it stands for. Second, the <em>Telegraph</em> story is about the implications of the decision that, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/aug/01/bbc-iplayer-tv-licence-iplayer-loophole\" title=\"\">from September</a>, people using the BBC iPlayer for watching TV programmes will be required \u2013 by law \u2013 to have a \u00a3145.50 TV licence.</p> <p>Given the success of the iPlayer and the way viewing habits have been changing, this is an entirely logical change. And since there is no point in having a law and not enforcing it, there has always been a system for detecting (and punishing) people who try to evade the licence fee. In the old analogue days, that involved the infamous \u201cdetector vans\u201d roaming suburban streets picking up the tell-tale electromagnetic emissions from television sets.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Is the BBC just playing the 've hav ze technology' line to scare us all into compliance?</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>But in a digital era, when people are not watching TV on television sets, how does one detect people who are watching on digital devices \u2013 laptops, tablets and smartphones? The answer, according to the <em>Telegraph</em>, is obvious. The new-generation detector vans that will \u201cfan out\u201d across the country will deploy a sinister digital surveillance technology called \u201cpacket sniffing\u201d. This will \u201clead to fears about invasion of privacy and follows years of concern over the heavy-handed approach of the BBC towards those suspected of not paying the licence fee\u201d.</p> <p>Packet sniffing is possible because most households with a broadband connection fast enough to stream video will have a home Wi-Fi network that can be monitored from outside the building. If you have the right kit, then it\u2019s child\u2019s play to do it. (Google\u2019s Street View cars were <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2010/may/15/google-admits-storing-private-data\" title=\"\">doing it</a> for a while, until they were caught.) As data streams flow across the household network, the sniffer captures each data packet and, if required, can decode its raw data, showing the values of various fields in the packet and analyse its content. In that sense, it\u2019s a <em>very</em> intrusive surveillance technology and if the BBC\u2019s licence-evasion contractor, Capita, were to deploy it then that would indeed be a big story because it would amount to mass surveillance.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/shortcuts/2016/aug/10/teefax-a-nostalgic-return-to-the-days-of-teletext\">Teefax: a nostalgic return to the days of teletext</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The only problem (for the <em>Telegraph</em>, anyway) is that the BBC has categorically denied that it plans to use packet-sniffing technology. \u201cWhile we don\u2019t discuss the details of how detection works for obvious reasons,\u201d it says, \u201cit is wrong to suggest that our technology involves capturing data from private Wi-Fi networks.\u201d</p> <p>On the other hand, the BBC did discuss with the comptroller and auditor general to the House of Commons, Sir Amyas CE Morse, the methods the corporation intends to use. In his <a href=\"https://www.nao.org.uk/\" title=\"\">annual report</a>, Sir Amyas says that \u201cwhere the BBC\u2026 suspects that an occupier is watching live television but not paying for a licence, it can send a detection van to check whether this is the case. Detection vans can identify viewing on a non-TV device in the same way that they can detect viewing on a television set. BBC staff were able to demonstrate this to my staff in controlled conditions sufficient for us to be confident that they could detect viewing on a range of non-TV devices.\u201d</p> <p>What are we to make of this? One possibility is that the BBC has developed non-intrusive technology for detecting iPlayer use. Given the corporation\u2019s technological resources, it\u2019s not an entirely implausible idea; after all, it was the BBC that developed the iPlayer, which is one of the most innovative and disruptive digital technologies of the last 15 years. Or does the key to the mystery lie in the sentence: \u201cWhere the BBC suspects that an occupier is watching live television but not paying for a licence, it can send a detection van to check whether this is the case\u2026\u201d? That\u2019s <em>targeted surveillance</em>, which is deemed acceptable under the <a href=\"http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2000/23/contents\" title=\"\">Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000</a> and related legislation. Or is the BBC just playing the \u201cve hav ze technology\u201d line to scare us all into compliance? We\u2019ll have to wait until the autumn to find out. Meantime, just for the record, this columnist does have a TV licence\u2026</p>",

Four out of five tourists come to London because of our cultural offer, and you can\u2019t have a situation where people are worried about how they get home.\u201d</p> <p>The night tube will provide a valuable boost to London\u2019s night-time economy, and later this year Khan will announce a \u201cnight tsar\u201d, who will champion the importance of the city\u2019s nightlife while balancing the needs of businesses, workers, residents and party-goers.</p> <p>Similar positions exist in Paris, Toulouse and Zurich, but perhaps the most established is former club promoter <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2016/mar/21/night-mayor-amsterdam-holland-mirik-milan-night-time-commission\" title=\"\">Mirik Milan</a>, who has been night mayor of Amsterdam since 2013. Milan believes a vibrant night-time economy benefits a city from social, cultural and economic perspectives: \u201cSocially, it\u2019s about people meeting: we\u2019re looking more at our screens than looking people in the eye, so it\u2019s really important. Culturally, look at the club scene in New York in the 1980s \u2013 it was a home to the LGBT community, where they could express themselves. And economically, if companies are thinking \u2018Where will I place my new headquarters\u2019, they\u2019re looking at schooling, housing, social structures, but also at what there is to do. Not everybody moves to London for the weather. If you want to be competitive, leisure and hospitality is much more important nowadays.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fc1e82888da2852f08c6649974df2023be90e1dc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fc1e82888da2852f08c6649974df2023be90e1dc/0_13_594_356/500.jpg\" alt=\"No sweat: getting home from a night\u2019s clubbing in London will be easier.\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">No sweat: getting home from a night\u2019s clubbing in London will be easier.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PYMCA/UIG via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Policy thinker and writer <a href=\"http://centreforlondon.org/person/ben-rogers/\" title=\"\">Ben Rogers</a>, director of think tank Centre for London, suggests that to maximise efficiency, London\u2019s infrastructure should be put to use throughout the night, for example with night-time deliveries to reduce levels of congestion, or by using space inventively. \u201cYou walk down Oxford Street, arguably the world\u2019s most famous retail street, at 9.30pm, and it\u2019s absolutely dead, there\u2019s no after-hours offer, you can\u2019t get a drink. Why isn\u2019t John Lewis turning its ground floor into a series of pop-up eateries? If we\u2019re going to get serious about this, there\u2019s huge potential to do things in a creative and interesting way.\u201d</p> <p>The night-time economy \u2013 made up of pubs, clubs, bars, restaurants, music venues and so on \u2013 is the UK\u2019s fifth biggest industry: <a href=\"http://www.tbr.co.uk/pages/tbr-observatory/night-time-economy.php\" title=\"\">according to economic research consultancy TBR</a>, it accounts for 1.3m jobs, and has a yearly revenue of \u00a366bn (6% of the UK total). This week <a href=\"http://londonfirst.co.uk/londons-24-hour-economy-could-be-worth-nearly-30bn-annually-by-2030-2/\" title=\"\">a report</a> for independent body London First estimated that London\u2019s night-time economy could be worth nearly \u00a330bn annually by 2030. Khan says: \u201cBearing in mind the jobs it creates and the businesses it supports, a night-time economy is part and parcel of being one of the world\u2019s greatest cities, and that\u2019s why it\u2019s important that we allow it to flourish and thrive rather than be at risk. If we\u2019re not careful, other cities \u2013 from Amsterdam to Paris to Berlin to New York to Tokyo \u2013 will overtake us, which will mean bad news for our economy.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Thousands of Londoners work through the night, and many of them take two or three night buses to get to work</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>In March this year the former London mayor, Boris Johnson, set up the <a href=\"https://www.london.gov.uk/press-releases/mayoral/night-time-commission-for-the-capital\" title=\"\">Night Time Commission</a>, an investigation into how to protect and manage London\u2019s night-time economy, which will report its findings in the autumn. Its members are diverse: local councillors, TfL staff, Home Office representatives, club owners and various creatives, including Undertones vocalist Feargal Sharkey. How does everyone get along? \u201cIt\u2019s taken a bit of time,\u201d says Alan Miller, NTC member and former owner of Vibe Bar in east London. \u201cEveryone had their concerns initially but they\u2019re starting to recognise that it\u2019s bigger than any one of us or our groups. Most of the police recognise that it\u2019s far better to have things lit up, with eyes and ears on the street.\u201d</p> <p>But negotiating something that works for everyone isn\u2019t easy: a balance needs to be found between revellers and residents, who tend to have conflicting needs. Jo Negrini, NTC member and chief executive of Croydon council, says: \u201cThe night tube is going to increase people\u2019s participation at night in London generally, which is a really good thing. But how do you balance that with the big issue of residential amenity? That will be the biggest challenge: wanting people to enjoy the city 24 hours a day but also being clear that it\u2019s a place where people do other things, live, work, enjoy outdoor spaces, use the city in a whole range of different ways.\u201d</p> <p>The NTC is also looking at diversifying nightlife: boutiques, yoga, gyms, cafes, bookshops, poetry nights. More varied activities would attract a range of ages at night, but it also means more people working late. Transport for London <a href=\"https://tfl.gov.uk/campaign/tube-improvements/what-we-are-doing/night-tube?cid=nighttube\" title=\"\">estimates</a> the night tube will support 2,000 additional permanent jobs and boost the economy by \u00a3360m. It will also make commuting easier for Londoners who already work nights. Khan says: \u201cThere are thousands of Londoners who work through the night \u2013 nurses, doctors, bodyguards, porters \u2013 and many of them take two or three night buses to get to work.\u201d</p> <p>Negrini believes that, although it will have an impact for councils in terms of basic services such as street cleaning and waste disposal, the night tube will have positive effects on areas outside of London\u2019s Zone 1. \u201cIt\u2019s about decentralising everything: what you would want is an increase in opportunities for people in terms of employment and generating economies in places like Croydon and at the different ends of the tube lines.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8f5b063f74067fb1c5489aa402ae077f01984e10\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8f5b063f74067fb1c5489aa402ae077f01984e10/0_113_2464_1478/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Thousands have to work at night, and London should be friendlier to them, say campaigners\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Thousands have to work at night, and London should be friendlier to them, say campaigners</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Martin Argles/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Nevertheless, night work comes with its own problems: it has been associated with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2015/oct/28/night-shift-three-million-workers-health-risks-obesity-cancer-diabetes\" title=\"\">health issues</a> including obesity, diabetes and breast cancer, and <a href=\"http://psychcentral.com/lib/shift-work-and-relationships/\" title=\"\">adverse effects</a> on home life and relationships. It is also a source of unhappiness for many who have it thrust upon them: after plans for the night tube were announced, tube drivers were involved in a number of controversial strikes. This, <a href=\"https://www.rmt.org.uk/news/rmt-confirms-new-strike-dates-in-night-tube-dispute/\" title=\"\">said RMT general secretary Mick Cash</a>, was \u201cto protect their work/life balance and not fall into a trap where they will be forced to wreck their home lives in order to [...] plug the staffing&#xa0;gaps&#xa0;in&#xa0;the&#xa0;night tube plans\u201d.</p> <p>Keeping all this in mind, Ben Rogers suggests increasing minimum wage and living wage rates for night work: \u201cI\u2019m all for night-time activity in London but I think it\u2019s important to attend to the welfare of night workers. A higher rate of pay would take into account some of the costs associated with shift work.\u201d</p> <p>Another central concern is safety: with the police <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/dec/08/theresa-may-police-years-budget-cuts-come\" title=\"\">increasingly stretched</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-35773749\" title=\"\">predictions that sex offences will rise</a> on the night tube, keeping Londoners safe will be a challenge. In March, British Transport Police identified <a href=\"http://www.standard.co.uk/news/london/revealed-the-tube-stations-where-crime-could-rise-when-night-tube-starts-a3199961.html\" title=\"\">12 \u201cred stations\u201d</a> at risk of increased crime and antisocial behaviour, which will receive extra patrols, and <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-32896183\" title=\"\">announced</a> that 100 officers would be patrolling the 144 open stations, which will continue to be staffed. \u201cIt\u2019s really important that people feel safe using the night tube,\u201d says Khan. \u201cWe\u2019ll be announcing additional officers in London when full services are under way, with at least as many officers out during the night as would be during the day.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>This is who we are, we go out, we eat, we drink and dance and socialise</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Mirik Milan acknowledges that nightlife has both an upside and a downside but feels that the problems need to be addressed pragmatically. One solution he implemented in Amsterdam was negotiating 24-hour licensing in 10 venues in and around the city: he argues that if you force everyone out of clubs at the same time, they\u2019ll still be full of energy, be annoyed and make noise, while unrestricted opening hours mean people leave gradually, quietly and in their own time. \u201cIt was an amazing, tangible step forward for Amsterdam, and a lot of venues have benefited from it.\u201d</p> <p>After a relaxation of UK licensing laws in 2005, it is theoretically possible to serve alcohol 24 hours a day in Britain, but venues need to follow the regulations set by their local council. As a result, many pubs still stop serving at 11pm. Negrini thinks that London\u2019s local licensing regulations \u201cwill absolutely need to be reviewed. All the local authorities need to be working together on that to make sure that there\u2019s a common approach across the city.\u201d</p> <p>Alan Miller is leading a campaign, <a href=\"http://nightlifematters.com\" title=\"\">#nightlifematters</a>, encouraging local residents who value nightlife to write to their MPs and councillors so that they don\u2019t just hear the complaints side. \u201cIt\u2019s about getting the voice of the silent majority to be heard,\u201d he says. Nightlife is also an important part of individual and national identity, adds Miller: \u201cQuite rightly, when the Bataclan happened, people in France said: \u2018This is who we are, we go out, we eat, we drink and dance and socialise.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>The night tube arrives at a difficult time in Britain\u2019s after-hours scene, with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/aug/11/clubs-closing-nightlife-uk\" title=\"\">45% of UK nightclubs</a> shutting down in the past 10 years and London losing 35% of its grassroots music venues between 2007 and 2015. Khan is planning a policy that protects music venues and nightclubs based on the <a href=\"http://musicvenuetrust.com/2014/09/what-is-agent-of-change-and-why-is-it-important/\" title=\"\">\u201cagent of change\u201d principle</a>: if housing developers are planning to build homes nearby, the cost of the noise insulation will fall to them. He adds: \u201cWe\u2019re also going to make sure that planning law is such that if you want to change a music venue or a nightclub from what it\u2019s currently being used for to luxury flats, you need to have very good reasons.\u201d</p> <p>Expectations for the night tube are high, then, but London\u2019s night-time economy won\u2019t be transformed overnight. \u201cOften people hope that when something changes, it\u2019s like a magic wand,\u201d says Milan. \u201cBut it\u2019s always a slow process: you will only get behavioural change if people invest more in their communities, if they have more sense of belonging. But the night tube is a really good step forward, and I think London has the obligation to do it, to keep it liveable and attractive for young people.\u201d</p> <p>For thousands of Londoners, young and old, Friday will be momentous. Will Khan be there? \u201cYou betcha. The question is whether I\u2019ll be allowed to go in the driver\u2019s cabin or not.\u201d</p> <h2>Night-time economies around the world</h2> <h2>Berlin </h2> <p>As the techno capital of the world, Berlin is famed for its unregulated and never-ending nightlife. By banding together to form a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/jul/03/berlin-clubs-royalties-closure-threat\" title=\"\">club commission</a>, more than 100 club owners have ensured that they speak with one voice and protect their cause. For example, new arrivals to an area cannot complain about noise that predated their move.</p> <h2><strong>Buenos Aires</strong></h2> <p>Evening meals starting at midnight, late-night ice -cream vendors, and 2am cinema screenings are just some of the things that are keeping residents, young and old, from heading home. But the city\u2019s night culture is increasingly under pressure: the Argentinian capital is one of the noisiest places on the planet, and the government is introducing fines for owners emitting noise in excess of&#xa0;90&#xa0;decibels.</p> <h2><strong>Hong Kong </strong><br></h2> <p>Finding bars and clubs open until 4am is not a problem in Hong Kong, one of the least regulated night-time economies on earth. But many licensed venues are struggling because of the competition they face from convenience stores selling cheap alcohol 24 hours a day. Venues are pushing the government to impose greater restrictions.</p> <h2><strong>Sydney </strong><br></h2> <p>Responding to problems with alcohol-fuelled violence, the New South Wales government imposed <a href=\"http://www.nsw.gov.au/newlaws\" title=\"\">a curfew on clubs and bars</a>: no more customers after 1.30am and no alcohol after 3am. The restrictions had mixed results: while street incidents were cut by 40%, footfall in the whole district plummeted by 82% last year, and 40 clubs have closed.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e2e6e601cb665536290b64be5c8517d3f2d9b6ca\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e2e6e601cb665536290b64be5c8517d3f2d9b6ca/0_0_4640_3120/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Clubbing in Tokyo.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"672\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Clubbing in Tokyo.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Yoshikazu Tsuno/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>Tokyo</strong><br></h2> <p>New regulations came into force in June this year, letting clubs apply for a licence to stay open until 5am, and overturning a 67-year-old law forbidding dancing in clubs after midnight.

I let my head get ahead of me and it\u2019s not something I should do and something that I\u2019ve been working on hard to not to, but maybe I\u2019ve still got another four years left in me. It\u2019s always hard, when you\u2019re in form coming into an event, it\u2019s hard not to think about outcomes. I think I just let my imagination run away with me a little bit. This was an Olympic final, I should have stepped up and performed better but that\u2019s the way the chips fell.\u201d</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57afc043e4b062ce4d2231ef\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-08-14T00:51:27.297Z\">1.51am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Just another friendly reminder: if you want to focus on tonight\u2019s Track and Field events, we have a liveblog dedicated to that</strong> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/may/30/fran-halsall-olympics-rio-2016-swimming\">here</a>. </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p> Eight laps to go and the Kenyans are pushing the pace.

From my very unscientific sample of half a dozen people, the most common answer was that tickets are too expensive for most locals. The cheapest Olympics tickets are 40Rs (a little under \u00a310) which are mostly for sports that are little known in Brazil such as hockey and rugby. </p> <p>That is a lot for people earning the minimum wage of 880Rs (about \u00a3200), especially when you add the cost of transport to the mostly distant venues. Other answers were that people were opposed to the Olympics on political grounds or that they were not interested in most of the sports.</p> <p>On the subject of ticket give-aways not happening, this may have something to do with a judge\u2019s ruling earlier this year that the Rio government must not hand out tickets in a municipal election year because it might influence votes. I have been trying to get confirmation from Rio2016 but no response yet.<br></p> <p>Finally, it is important to note that this is not just Brazil\u2019s fault. As my colleague Owen Gibson notes part of the problem is that authorised re-sellers (many of whom are based overseas) have not been able to shift tickets. In that case, the empty seats might be caused by the Zika epidemic, crime and other negative stories about Rio in the run-up to the Games.</p> <p>On a separate note, I\u2019m now watching the last two minutes of a cracking basketball game between regional rivals Brazil and Argentina. Just three points in it. The crowd are going crazy. Can\u2019t see an empty seat.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57af7091e4b0c23bfed89310\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-08-13T19:13:52.572Z\">8.13pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Nadal is cooking in the third set, pushing Del Potro on his serve and geeing up the largely pro-Rafa crowd.

Due to illness, he was drafted into the GB 4x200 metre relay which they duly won.</em></p> <p><em>Perhaps the award for most multiple events would go to the German, Carl Schuhmann, who took part in the 1908 games. Not content with winning team golds in two events at the gymnastics and an individual gold in the vault, he entered and won the wrestling competition. He also too part in the weightlifting, triple-jump, long-jump, and shot putt during the same games.<br><br>The most unusual multi-eventer was probably Walter Winans, (US) who won silver for shooting and gold for sculpture at the 1912 Olympics.\u201d</em></p> <p>Shooting and sculpture: together at last.

  "<p>The stark media question of June is back,<a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/08/business/balance-fairness-and-a-proudly-provocative-presidential-candidate.html\" title=\"\"> demanding answers in August</a>. \u201cIf you\u2019re a working journalist and you believe that Donald J Trump is a demagogue playing to the nation\u2019s worst racist and nationalistic tendencies, that he cosies up to anti-American dictators and that he would be dangerous with control of the United States nuclear codes, how the heck are you supposed to cover him?\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s that fairness-and-balance dilemma that haunted the BBC through Brexit, posed in extreme terms. And Jim Rutenberg, the media correspondent of the <em>New York Times</em>, wriggles to find a response. This is \u201cuncomfortable and uncharted territory for every mainstream, non-opinion journalist I\u2019ve ever known, and, by normal standards, untenable\u201d. It \u201cupsets balance, that idealistic form of journalism with a capital \u2018J\u2019 we\u2019ve been trained to always strive for\u201d. But, \u201clet\u2019s face it: balance has been on vacation since Mr Trump stepped onto his golden Trump Tower escalator last year to announce his candidacy\u201d.</p> <p>Ah! The wriggle room opens into a broader corridor. Because Trump received so much natural coverage early on, because he was a bird of exotic plumage made for TV sofas, so there\u2019s a sort of justice in watching him being taken apart later on, in the more serious part of the campaign. Fate supposedly supplies a fairness that mere reporters can\u2019t manage.</p> <p>Well, perhaps. But that\u2019s pretty damned convenient. And it doesn\u2019t quite measure up to the challenge. The <em>New York Times</em> has hardly been full of judicious articles examining the deeper meaning and validity of Trumpism, but it\u2019s been a paragon compared with a <em>Washington Post</em> stuffed day after day with pieces taking a chainsaw to the Donald. \u201cTrump\u2019s shallowness runs deep\u201d; how \u201cthe Republican party has lost its soul\u201d; see \u201cthe 30-second video that is absolutely devastating for Trump\u201d; why \u201cDonald Trump is suffering from mushroom breath\u201d. And so on and so balefully forth.</p> <p>There\u2019s no pretence of artificial fairness here, more a howl of foreboding as stumble turns to freefall in a hapless row over assassinating Clinton. \u201cWe have not seen a major-party nominee this determined to lie, this personally erratic or this lacking in self-control. A he said/she said account of the race therefore is misleading,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/right-turn/wp/2016/08/08/media-objectivity-should-not-mean-indifference-to-truth/?utm_term=.e2c63a49ad1f\" title=\"\">cries Jennifer Rubin in the <em>Post</em></a>.</p> <p>Examine the \u201cmassive confusion about the demands of \u2018objectivity\u2019\u201d, she says. \u201cFalse balance (Vladimir Putin says Russia is not in Ukraine; the US administration says it is) cannot substitute for presentation of ascertainable fact. (Vladimir Putin falsely claims Russia is not in Ukraine; the administration has identified Russian forces...) Ironically, American conservatives used to be critics of postmodernism, arguing that there are knowable, objective facts. It seems to have escaped notice, however, that this standard is as applicable to politics as it is to other endeavours.\u201d</p> <p>Thus, by fair means denouncing foul conduct, the US press that perennially makes a big, often self-regarding issue of its fairness and balance (in contrast to utterly unbalanced cable news) seems to declare Trump a special case where the rules don\u2019t apply. \u201cIt may not always seem fair to Mr Trump or his supporters,\u201d Rutenberg concludes. \u201cBut journalism shouldn\u2019t measure itself against any one campaign\u2019s definition of fairness. It is journalism\u2019s job to be true to the readers and viewers, and true to the facts, in a way that will stand up to history\u2019s judgment. To do anything less would be untenable.\u201d</p> <p>But the difficulty \u2013 the special British Brexit difficulty \u2013 is that what\u2019s untenable in the States is legally impossible here. Laura Kuenssberg\u2019s BBC paddle round the debris of the UK Brexit campaign last week wasn\u2019t particularly revealing because the big beasts of success and failure (Boris, Gove, Osborne and the PM we used to call Dave) had made an excuse and clammed up. But her tour of rival spin doctors at least brought Matthew Elliott, Leave\u2019s supreme director, to our screens, confirming with a smirk that the supposed \u00a3350m heading to Brussels each week was big on the side of the bus because it stirred up controversy over the cost of the EU rather than representing any kind of objective truth about future NHS funding. Oh! And the battle bus itself was deliberately painted red to confuse Labour voters who didn\u2019t know which side their party was on.</p> <p>Mini-Trumpery, you might say. One monster whopper tossed into a foetid pool of mendacity and Remain exaggeration. But the question of principle here \u2013 the question that has America\u2019s editors in a twist \u2013 can\u2019t be brushed away. The BBC in particular and public service in general has Ofcom holding the statutory fairness ring. That\u2019s she said/he said according to the rulebook. You might offer countervailing facts on your website. You might ask hard questions once the campaign is over. But while referendums or elections are live, the room for manoeuvre over truth and fiction is officially defined and patrolled, with licence-fee menaces just offstage.</p> <p>In short, if Trump were prospective PM here and now, then mandatory fairness and balance would be his greatest friend \u2013 just as it drove the notorious Boris bus. And our legislation deems that this must be so because it expects politicians to tell the truth \u2013 or at least heightened, defensible versions of it. Big lies not included.</p> <p>Of course old Remain supporters should just get over the loss and get on with their lives. But that\u2019s no reason not to recognise whopping holes in the media road \u2013 or not to agonise over mending them \u2013 before the next counterfactual disaster of a crash.</p>",
  "<p>Elizabeth and John Gilbert* were strolling the streets of Athens on a Sunday afternoon when they were ambushed. A knife was held to their throats while the two attackers seized their belongings before fleeing with their money and their mobiles. Unable to call anyone without phones or contact lists, they headed for the nearest police station to report the crime.</p> <p>Early next morning they managed to ring their service provider, Vodafone, to inform it of the theft. A month later a phone bill arrived for \u00a35,789.</p> <p>\u201cIt appears we fell victim not only to theft at knife-point, but also to one of Europe\u2019s fastest-growing crimes, where <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/aug/01/sim-card-flaw-cellphone-hackers-karsten-nohl\" title=\"\">thieves use stolen sim cards to repeatedly dial premium rate numbers</a> set up by gang members who profit from the proceeds,\u201d John Gilbert says. \u201cVodafone insists we should pay this massive sum, without giving any consideration to the circumstances.\u201d</p> <p>Tourists abroad are increasingly being targeted by criminal gangs whose priority is not mobile phone handsets, but the more valuable sim card inside. Few people have any inkling that bills of thousands of pounds can be racked up in just hours when their mobiles are stolen. In a global racket known as international revenue share fraud, gangs target holiday resorts and use the sims from stolen handsets to ring <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2014/may/17/bt-bill-phone-teeing-scam\" title=\"\">international premium rate numbers</a> in countries in Africa and Asia, where the cost of connecting a call is high. The fraudsters are paid a fee by the premium rate number provider for every minute of calls they make.</p> <p>It\u2019s a scam that is rapidly proliferating \u2013 the Communication Fraud Control Association found that $10.7bn (\u00a38.3bn) was lost to revenue sharing scams last year, a 497% increase from 2013. Thanks to new technologies, one phone can be connected to up to six premium rate lines at a time with calls lasting up to an hour, the optimum time after which many providers will terminate a high cost call. Thus sim cards can be milked like debit cards, only \u2013 until recently \u2013 without the \u00a350 cap that banks apply to debts run up when the latter are stolen.</p> <p>It was because of horror stories like the Gilberts\u2019 that in March last year five of Britain\u2019s biggest mobile phone companies bowed to years of government pressure and signed a voluntary code to protect customers from bills racked up by phone thieves.</p> <p>Under the Code of practice on consumer billing, customers\u2019 liability for such charges is capped at \u00a3100 provided the phone is reported lost or stolen within 24 hours. Before the code came into force, customers were responsible for all charges accrued before a theft was reported. Vodafone was the last of the signatories to implement the agreement last September and has capped customers\u2019 liability to \u00a3500 if a stolen phone is flagged up within five days.</p> <p>Unfortunately for the Gilberts, their ordeal in February last year occurred five months before Vodafone\u2019s cap was introduced. And despite the fact that Vodafone acknowledged the importance of the agreement \u201cto improve customers\u2019 experience at what can be an upsetting time\u201d, the company has refused to consider reducing or waiving the bill.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We were in shock \u2026 our first thought was not 'we must find a way to call Vodafone', but to get to a police station</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cWe were in shock \u2026 and our first thought was not \u2018we must find a way to call Vodafone\u2019, but to get to a police station,\u201d the Gilberts say. \u201cAll our contacts were stored on our stolen phones and all our money taken, so it was not feasible to call anyone straight away.\u201d</p> <p>A voluntary code which would have protected the Gilberts was supposed to be in place by spring 2014, but it wasn\u2019t until the following summer that the main signatories introduced limited liability. The favourite excuse of companies was that they did not receive victims\u2019 call records from overseas providers until the following day \u2013 in fact, for the past eight years 90% of the world\u2019s phone operators have been part of an international agreement, the Near Real Time Data Roaming Exchange, which obliges them to share data for fraud analysis within four hours or else accept liability for the cost of all calls after that time.</p> <p>However, according to Colin Yates, a fraud consultant and former head of fraud management at Vodafone, shrinking budgets mean that companies don\u2019t always spot illegal activity when the records are received. \u201cRecords are not always analysed 24/7, so while suspicious calling activity may be reported by the roaming partner within four hours, the notification will not be actioned for a day or so until the home network fraud analysts return to the office,\u201d he says.</p> <p>\u201cIf a customer normally spends, say, \u00a350 per month and makes a couple of international calls, then suddenly over a 24-hour period there are 100 international calls and a \u00a3500 bill, then it is not unreasonable for them to expect their service provider to identify this and take some immediate action.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2016/apr/30/end-bill-shock-eu-mobile-roaming-charges-slashed-phone\">An end to \u2018bill shock\u2019 as EU mobile roaming charges are slashed</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It\u2019s likely, therefore, that over the years many customers have been sent bills that they should not have had to pay.

His provider, Vodafone again, refused to waive the charges until a barrister judged them likely to be invalid and offered to take up&#xa0;his case.</p> <p>A similar intransigence has threatened the credit rating and the stress levels of the Gilberts over the past 18 months. It has also compromised their telecommunications. \u201cWe agreed to keep paying our monthly contract while disputing the bill, but they now keep suspending our connection every couple of weeks, and we need to fight hard to convince them to re-connect us,\u201d they say. Only when <em>the Observer</em> contacted Vodafone and alerted Ofcom did the company back down and write off the debt.</p> <p>Ofcom, which allowed providers to delay the introduction of liability caps since it first required them in 2012, takes a dim view of Vodafone\u2019s behaviour: \u201cWe remain concerned about the length of time it has taken the company to address this dispute,\u201d a spokesperson says. \u201cLast year, we launched a formal investigation into Vodafone\u2019s complaints handling processes, which is ongoing.\u201d</p> <p>Vodafone now says it will apply the cap retrospectively in the Gilberts\u2019 case in belated recognition that \u201ctheir particular circumstances were very difficult and distressing\u201d. \u201cWe are sorry this issue has dragged on for so long,\u201d says a spokesperson who secured the reprieve within three days of media intervention.</p> <p>Meanwhile, critics claim that the new cap on customer liability, while welcome, does not go far enough \u2013 especially since mobile phone providers should themselves be able to flag up suspicious activity rather than waiting to be notified of a theft.</p> <p>\u201cSince the cap was introduced, the number of people coming to us with extortionate bills from stolen mobiles has dropped,\u201d says Gillian Guy, chief executive of Citizens Advice. \u201cThis is positive, but we have always argued that mobile phone companies could go further by getting rid of time limits which give customers only 24 hours to report their phone stolen and trigger the cap. It\u2019s not always possible to report a theft within a day, and abolishing this rule would make the cap fairer.</p> <p>\u201cWe also think \u00a3100 is too much for a victim of crime to pay and are calling for the cap to be cut to \u00a350.\u201d</p> <p><em>*Not their real names</em></p> <h2>How to avoid the shock of a post-holiday bill<br></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"043ccbf5b135b1d24d207673b3be0c0d00e6fa50\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/043ccbf5b135b1d24d207673b3be0c0d00e6fa50/0_120_2200_1320/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Before you go on holiday, register your mobile to help police trace you if it is recovered.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Before you go on holiday, register your mobile to help police trace you if it is recovered.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Edmund Terakopian/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Up to 300,000 phones are reported stolen each year in the UK according to the National Mobile Phone Crime Unit, and many more customers are victims of theft while overseas.</p> <p>To minimise liability when thieves run up large charges, notify your service provider as soon as you discover that your handset is missing.

  "<p>The most dangerous phrase in the English language is \u201cbe a man\u201d. To be a man today, says film-maker Jennifer Siebel Newsom, is to fight for success and sex, to reject empathy, and to never, ever cry. The result is depression, anxiety and violence.</p> <p>Siebel Newsom\u2019s first documentary, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2014/mar/03/feminist-film-maker-taking-on-hollywood\"><em>Miss Representation</em></a>, explored the way the media contributes to the under-representation of women in power, and premiered at the 2011 Sundance Film Festival. When she was touring with the film she was pregnant with her second child, a son. And as she discussed the need for positive female role models, she inevitably heard from audiences asking: \u201cBut what about the boys?\u201d Some $100,000 of Kickstarter donations later, she premiered <em>The Mask You Live In</em>. It has just arrived on Netflix, a fast edit of men talking wearily, and boys confused; an attempt to speak to what she calls the \u201cboy crisis\u201d. As a child, one young contributor says quietly, he used to have a group of close friends. Now he\u2019s a teenager he struggles in \u201cfinding people I can talk to... because I feel like I\u2019m not supposed to get help\u201d. \u201cIf you never cry,\u201d says another, \u201cthen you have all these feelings stuffed up inside you and then you can\u2019t get them out.\u201d In this film, Siebel Newsom calls for a whole new masculinity.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>If you never cry, then you have all these feelings stuffed up inside you</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The day I spoke to her, I passed three boys sitting at a bus stop. One was describing how gorgeous his wife would be when he grew up. \u201cShe\u2019s going to be so hot... and I\u2019m going to cheat on her like crazy.\u201d At 42, Siebel Newsom has recently given birth to her fourth child with husband <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/gavin-newsom\">Gavin</a>, former mayor of San Francisco, current lieutenant governor of California, and the man best known for greenlighting same-sex marriages long before US courts had sanctioned the practice. She deftly juggles our interview with her son\u2019s insistent attempts to pull her away to play \u2013 what this means is she gets to the point. When she started researching, she found boys were more likely than girls to be diagnosed with a behaviour disorder, more likely to be prescribed stimulant medications, more likely to binge drink, more likely to be expelled from school, and more likely to commit a violent crime. At university entry level in the UK, women outnumber men in two-thirds of subjects. Three to four times as many men take their own lives than women; men aged between 20 and 49 are more likely to die from suicide than any other single form of death. \u201cKnowing all this,\u201d says Siebel Newsom, \u201cand being pregnant with a son, I knew that not only did I want to make sure he didn\u2019t become one of those statistics, but that I had to help change this culture for everyone.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7c7d8afeeeaca1fbf93b32eac5cc3ada22f9ad1e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7c7d8afeeeaca1fbf93b32eac5cc3ada22f9ad1e/14_0_1593_956/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Life lessons: educator and youth advocate Ashanti Branch discusses feelings with a group of teenage boys.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Life lessons: educator and youth advocate Ashanti Branch discusses feelings with a group of teenage boys.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy of therepresentationproject-org</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It\u2019ll take more than a film, she admits. Her nonprofit organisation, The Representation Project, works alongside the films, campaigning to challenge stereotypes. The most persuasive element, though, is Siebel Newsom herself who, in her previous life as an actor, was told to remove her Stanford MBA from her CV because it was \u201cthreatening\u201d, but who still has that actorly skill of talking in a way that will make people listen.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Experts link the repression of growing up male with mass shootings and murder</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>In one scene in the documentary, a teacher gives a group of boys each a piece of paper. On one side they write how they are seen by other people, and on the other what they are feeling. Then they scrunch it up and throw it into the circle. On the outside of all the notes were words like \u201ctough\u201d, \u201cfearless\u201d. Inside, \u201clonely\u201d. It\u2019s with awkward agony that one boy rests a hand on his friend\u2019s shoulder as he cries into his fists. The shock comes with the realisation they all feel the same. Experts swiftly link the repression required when growing up male with mass shootings and murder, which makes the film particularly poignant today. But while <em>Miss Representation </em>featured talking heads like Gloria Steinem, Jane Fonda and Condoleezza Rice, there are no recognisable faces in her second film. She pauses when I ask why. \u201cIt was largely because they didn\u2019t exist,\u201d she says. \u201cMen are not speaking publicly about these issues.\u201d The implication is that their silence is part of the problem.</p> <p>Is masculinity really a mask? The film is compelling \u2013 her experts in neuroscience, psychology, sociology, sports, education and media are obviously knowledgeable and passionate \u2013 but the idea that the manliness they discuss is purely cultural isn\u2019t questioned. In <a href=\"http://time.com/2974/masculinity-is-more-than-a-mask/\"><em>Time</em></a> magazine, Christina Hoff Sommers (author of two \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/feb/24/men-women-masculinity-feminism\">meninist</a>\u201d books about boys) worries Siebel Newsom is less concerned with helping boys than with \u201cre-engineering their masculinity according to specifications from some out-of-date gender studies textbook\u201d. She suggests talking about emotions might have less \u201cvalue\u201d for boys, that men\u2019s stoicism is protective. She says the film is misleading, giving the impression that boys are severely depressed, stating contrasting figures showing clinical depression is much lower than in girls. Hoff Sommers\u2019s most persuasive suggestion is that instead of simply critiquing masculinity, Siebel Newsom\u2019s first objective should be to help mental health services to adapt to better meet the needs of men, conditioned or not : to harness that competitiveness, aggression, to reflect the energy back and use them for good. To defeat an enemy, like Captain America with his reflective shield.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"21ba26846aaf10cb559e5cd1b7ce099fad30c31c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/21ba26846aaf10cb559e5cd1b7ce099fad30c31c/0_0_1795_1077/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Reaching across the divide: Siebel Newsom during the production of her documentary.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Reaching across the divide: Siebel Newsom during the production of her documentary.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy of therepresentationproject-org</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But perhaps that\u2019s next \u2013 Siebel Newsom says this is just the beginning. Since premiering the film, she sees the results of the boy crisis everywhere, from misogynist responses to Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign to the recent Stanford University rape case, where the father of an athlete convicted on multiple charges of sexual assault said his son should not have to go to prison for \u201c20 minutes of action\u201d. \u201cThe way the father and the judge protected that young boy showed again how we privilege white males and star athletes,\u201d says Siebel Newsom. \u201cAs a society, we need to take a real look at that and recognise the damage that is being done when we continue to privilege those classes, those communities, and blame the victim.\u201d</p> <p>After screenings, Siebel Newsom says men approach her, crying. \u201cThere were men in their 70s saying, \u2018That was my life.\u2019 Men in their 20s and 30s who\u2019d tell us they no longer feel so alone. And men in their 40s who have children who go, \u2018OK, I\u2019ve got to raise my own sons differently.\u2019\u201d She was moved. \u201cThat is where we have to inspire the good men, the brave men, the courageous men, to stand up to those who are trying to belittle them. We\u2019re not going to move the needle on gender parity, on violence, until we have more men entering the conversation and using their platform to support those of us who are trying to do good.\u201d</p> <p>When making the film, she says she was taken aback. \u201cWhat really surprised me was how pure and gentle and confused boys were,\u201d she says. \u201cHow they felt so much pressure to become someone they felt they weren\u2019t. \u2018I don\u2019t want to date girls, I just want to be friends with them\u2019; \u2018I don\u2019t know why I only have to play football.\u2019 It\u2019s in those school years where they start feeling this need to disconnect, and you see the pain, anxiety, the alienation that results from them denying their true selves. It\u2019s heartbreaking,\u201d she says.</p> <p>I hear her son calling for her again. \u201cBecause, at the end of the day,\u201d she adds, \u201cnobody wins.\u201d</p> <h2>Matthew Ryder: \u2018My dad\u2019s notion of being a man was flexible\u2019<br></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"324d4a77b6f740731f858b8bc196e097be59e2d5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/324d4a77b6f740731f858b8bc196e097be59e2d5/85_29_1403_1403/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Matthew Ryder\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>When I was growing up, my father\u2019s explanation of \u2018being a man\u2019 could be bewildering. \u2018It\u2019s not about what sex you are,\u2019 he would say, before adding even more confusingly, \u2018Your mother can teach you more about being a man than anyone I know.\u2019</p> <p>Eventually I understood. Unlike many fathers in the 1970s, his concept of being a man was not the opposite of being feminine or emotional. It was the opposite of being childish and immature. It meant having the courage to face your fears and responsibilities, but also not being afraid of your emotions or weaknesses. It was about being a trusted friend and an equal partner.</p> <p>He could have just said \u2018be a good person\u2019 rather than \u2018be a man\u2019. But it wouldn\u2019t have had the same effect. He knew that, as a boy, I would one day be interacting with the rest of the world as an adult male \u2013 a man. I was going to have to understand what that meant in my dealings with women, with other men, and with society as a whole. If he did not give me a positive identity of what it was to be man, he knew that one of the many negative ones would quickly fill the vacuum. He was giving me an identity that would prepare me for life.</p> <p>Over the years, that identity grounded me through my successes and failures. It also meant that, despite my youthful love of hip-hop, reggae and sports, I was never really seduced by the cartoonish, misogynistic versions of manhood \u2013black manhood, in particular \u2013 that they often offered. It inoculated me from the worst excesses of testosterone-fuelled nonsense.</p> <p>My father\u2019s notion of being a man was also flexible. As I grew from a child of the 70s to an adult of the 90s, it grew with me. I learned that sometimes a man should back down from a fight; that real men are also feminists; and that not being seen as a \u2018sissy\u2019 is meaningless, while not being homophobic is important.</p> <p>In a modern, gender-fluid world, is the notion of being a man still relevant? Are we not all just people? Yes and no. The philosopher Jerry Cohen wrote: \u2018There is no way of being human, other than a way of being human.\u2019 Being a man is one of those ways.</p> <p>Matthew Ryder is a QC and part-time judge.

I was never happier than when I was sitting on his knee watching westerns like Wagon Train and Rawhide on our tiny black-and-white TV.</p> <p>My father was cowboy mad and so was I. After I said my prayers for all the people I loved, my mother had to wait until I was in bed and fast asleep before she could gently relieve me of my beloved cowboy suit. Cowboys were real men. They were tough and they never cried.</p> <p>But when my mother was killed in a road crash less than a year later, I cried. My father had to be cut from the wreckage and, when he came home, I cried again. In place of my funny, loving, playful dad was a grieving, selfish, violent drunk. He beat the women he lived with and he beat me. I loved him still, but learned to hate him just as much. The care home I was sent to at 11 was full of boys like me. No aspiring train drivers or astronauts among us \u2013 we told each other that, when we grew up, we\u2019d be gangsters and crooks. No crying allowed.</p> <p>My teenage years were punctuated by spells in prisons that lionised toughness and frowned on cry-babies. Lifting weights and being \u2018hard\u2019 was what counted, what got respect. At 20, I should have been a man. Instead, like my father, I\u2019d become a selfish, violent drunk.</p> <p>Self-loathing took me down a dark road, leaving in my wake immeasurable pain and grief. At the end of it, an Old Bailey judge called me \u2018brutal, vicious and callous\u2019 and jailed me for life. Two years in, a prison psychologist told me, \u2018We\u2019re all born lovable.\u2019 I said, \u2018Even me?\u2019 She said, \u2018Even you.\u2019 Contrition almost destroyed me. For the first time in a long time I cried again. I was desperate to be a man. I just wasn\u2019t sure what that meant. In the end, I decided to try to just be a decent human being.

Not in the manner of loving them, for I think I am gentle, too, but in the leaving. Porn, piracy, hijack, honeytrap: in my pursuit of love I have committed and been had by all these. And the frightening thing is, however special I thought I might be, in my teeny ravings, which are ongoing in the male part of my lizard brain, I\u2019m not.

The only official comment was from Greg Clark, the new business, energy and industrial strategy secretary, who welcomed EDF\u2019s approval of the project but added: \u201cThe government will now consider carefully all the component parts of this project and make its decision in the early autumn.\u201d</p> <p>On the face of it, taking time to review such a controversial project is sensible. After all, there are genuine doubts about whether EDF, which is 85% owned by the French government, can build the plant and its European pressurised reactor (EPR) on time, on budget and safely. The National Audit Office has warned that taxpayers could end up paying more than \u00a330bn through a range of subsidies designed to support the project.</p> <p>But the role of China has taken centre stage. The China General Nuclear Power Corporation (CGN) has a 33% stake in Hinkley, with a gentleman\u2019s agreement that it will go on to build its own nuclear plants in Britain. Last week it emerged that CGN and a consultant to the company <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/aug/11/hinkley-point-c-case-against-cgn-has-the-feel-of-a-modern-spy-thriller\" title=\"\">have been charged in the US with conspiring to help the Chinese government develop nuclear material</a>.</p> <p>We now know, thanks to Vince Cable, that May raised security concerns about that while home secretary in the coalition. Her joint chief of staff, Nick Timothy, wrote last year that David Cameron\u2019s government was \u201cselling our national security to China\u201d.</p> <p>No one in May\u2019s new government has done much to move people away from the idea that it is concerned about China\u2019s involvement in Hinkley. That is presumably why China\u2019s ambassador to the UK said last week that Beijing\u2019s relationship with the UK was at a \u201ccrucial historical juncture\u201d.</p> <p>Britain\u2019s relationship with China, the world\u2019s second-biggest economy, is clearly at risk because of the plant. The fact that the Hinkley saga \u2013 which has rumbled on for a decade \u2013 is reaching a climax just weeks after Britain voted to leave the European Union adds another ingredient to the mix.</p> <p>Lord Mandelson, the former business secretary, says Britain must show that it is open for business and \u201ccan\u2019t be too fussy about who we do trade with\u201d. Mandelson\u2019s comments represent the extreme end of one side of the argument, with Timothy\u2019s at the other.</p> <p>Britain must find a way to work with China, a key investor in London Heathrow, Canary Wharf and football clubs. It could also back other key infrastructure projects such as High Speed 2. China has already shown it is keen to invest in Britain, where the legal and regulatory system offer the reassurance of a safe haven for assets.</p> <p>Security, of course, should be a concern. But when Britain agreed to sell British Energy to EDF for \u00a312.5bn in 2008, it became inevitable that foreign investment and expertise would be needed to build new nuclear power stations.</p> <p>The only way, therefore, to develop a home-grown energy policy is to move away from large Hinkley-type projects,&#xa0;either towards forms of renewable energy or towards smaller nuclear&#xa0;power plants, which Rolls-Royce can build.</p> <p>But if the government does decide to scrap Hinkley Point C, the decision should not be about security: it should be because alternatives offer more value, efficiency, and safety. The potential cost to the taxpayer through subsidies to EDF and China, and the question marks about the EPR reactor \u2013 there still isn\u2019t one in service anywhere in the world \u2013 are more pressing concerns than Chinese involvement.</p> <p>If the government does scrap Hinkley Point C, it must outline the alternative route it intends to take \u2013 and then ensure there are no hard feelings in Beijing.</p> <h2>Inheritance tax law needs reform<br></h2> <p>The Dukes of Westminster have had almost as much influence on tax law as they have on the garden squares of Mayfair and Belgravia. The \u00a39bn property fortune now passing to a new generation would probably not exist today without a legal environment moulded over time by the very richest families.</p> <p>The second duke, famous for his four wives and a love affair with Coco Chanel, was more cautious with his finances than his personal life might suggest. In 1936 he won a case in which the judge stated that every man was entitled to arrange his affairs so that the tax owing was \u201cless than it otherwise would be\u201d. The ruling has been a thorn in the revenue\u2019s side ever since.</p> <p>The trust structure from which the 25-year-old Hugh Grosvenor and his sisters will benefit dates from his death in 1953. For the Grosvenors, the 40% death duties incurred by normal estates do not apply. Trusts can last for up to 125 years, with wealth flowing freely from one generation to another.</p> <p>Campaigners are calling for the beneficiaries of family trusts to be named on a public register, and for trusts to publish annual accounts, as private companies do.</p> <p>Lobbyists in the thriving wealth management industry argue that opaqueness provides protection. Research suggests as many as a quarter of the beneficiaries are either children or vulnerable adults. A public register would expose individuals who have access to significant sums.</p> <p>But the secrecy arguments are weak. These vulnerable individuals do not control the money from which they benefit \u2013 that responsibility lies with competent adult trustees.</p> <p>The latest available data shows the number of trusts registered with the tax office has fallen slowly over time, to 160,500 in the financial year ending in March 2013. But their total annual income has risen to \u00a32bn.</p> <p>The degree to which trusts should be taxed is up for discussion, but the argument for transparency has surely been won.</p> <h2>Stop whingeing about apprenticeships<br></h2> <p>Depending on who you listen to, the government\u2019s planned <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/aug/12/apprenticeships-levy-will-go-ahead-next-year-uk-government-confirms\" title=\"\">apprenticeship levy</a> is a desperately needed scheme to address Britain\u2019s chronic skills shortage or a badly designed payroll tax that will drive down the quality of training.</p> <p>Both sides were out in force to make their case on Friday when the government confirmed it was launching the levy next April and ignoring the calls from business for a postponement in the wake of the Brexit vote.</p> <p>Just days earlier, Downing Street had faced down calls from corporate lobbyists to slow the implementation of the national living wage.</p> <p>Critics who say that the design of the apprenticeship levy needs tweaking to get the kind of schemes we need may be proven right. But Theresa May\u2019s government is right to press ahead with an April launch.</p> <p>May said last week that she wants to tackle inequality, and creating more routes into secure jobs with good career prospects is a key part of that.</p>",

And he looks great. Curly helmet feathers, white lacy boot turner-overers (I don\u2019t know the technical terms), scary gun, excellent leather man-bags and a bloody marvellous suede coat.

Not while wearing this outfit. I am interested in the transformative effect of clothes (wearing a white doctor\u2019s coat has been proven to make people perform better in tests), and Thomas\u2019s Civil War outfit is utterly transformative. It might not be for those who view him, who could point to his contemporary-looking beard and say, \u201cNot very (Laughing) Cavalier\u201d. But that\u2019s not the point.

But nothing happens \u2013 in life, in work, in love \u2013 unless you take it seriously, and Thomas\u2019s long years in Civil War re-enactment shows he does exactly this. He has knowledge. He knows what he\u2019s doing.</p> <p>We celebrate OTT computer games and Imax films, but actually, the best events are often sparked by a combination of the real world and our imaginations. At a festival, you imagine you can feel the love when you dance with a group of strangers. At a re-enactment, you imagine the fear when you recreate a battle. And so, for that time, it is real.

  "<p>Gold medals never come easy, but Mo Farah\u2019s third was harder than most. First Farah fell, and then he found himself in a fierce final sprint with Kenya\u2019s Paul Tanui. Farah won in 27min 05.17sec, and by a little less than half a second. Afterwards, of course, we saw that familiar grin, and were treated to the Mobot all over again. But in the press conference that followed the medal ceremony Farah faced a hard question about his association with the Somalian coach Jama Aden, who was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/jun/20/mo-farah-jama-aden-somali-coach-arrest-doping-charges-british-athletics \">arrested by the Spanish police on doping charges</a> last June. At the time British Athletics explained that Aden had worked as an \u201cunofficial facilitator\u201d for Farah in 2015, and that all he had done was \u201chold a stopwatch\u201d. Four years on from the London Olympics, the atmosphere is different now.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"49552e007b1e3ef328d5bd765127eee95c1556a2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/49552e007b1e3ef328d5bd765127eee95c1556a2/0_47_4096_2458/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Mo Farah celebrates on the podium with second placed Paul Kipngetich Tanui (left) of Kenya and third-placed Tamirat Tola of Ethiopia.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mo Farah celebrates on the podium with second placed Paul Kipngetich Tanui (left) of Kenya and third-placed Tamirat Tola of Ethiopia.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Yoan Valat/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>A journalist wanted to know why Farah, as a clean athlete, kept such associations. He asked about a photo of him and Aden together. \u201cObviously it is a small sport,\u201d Farah said. \u201cThere are so many athletes who compete, so getting pictures with someone who asks you to take a picture, you\u2019re not going to say no, are you? It doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019ve trained with him.\u201d </p> <p>Farah continued \u201cObviously I believe in clean sport and we\u2019ve got to do what we can, but at the same time you can only control yourself.\u201d </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/14/jessica-ennis-hill-to-decide-on-future-after-claiming-silver-in-heptathlon\">Jessica Ennis-Hill to decide on future after claiming silver in heptathlon</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It left a sour note, but Farah shouldn\u2019t be immune to interrogation any more than any other athlete. The truth is that a lot of winners here will face their own versions of these questions in the next week. That\u2019s the the sorry state the sport is in.</p> <p>Back to Farah\u2019s achievement, then, on a night when there was no repeat of London\u2019s Super Saturday as Jessica Ennis-Hill and Greg Rutherford couldn\u2019t quite match their 2012 golds, settling for heptathlon silver and long jump bronze respectively. Farah is the sixth man to win two Olympic 10,000m titles, following on from Paavo Nurmi, Emil Z\u00e1topek, Lasse Vir\u00e9n, Haile Gebrselassie and Kenenisa Bekele. If he wasn\u2019t there already, Farah now ranks high in his sport\u2019s hall of fame. If he wins the 5,000m next week, he will be only the second man, after Vir\u00e9n, to win both Olympic titles twice. Vir\u00e9n famously fell too, when he won the 10,000m for the first time in 1972. He got tangled up with Emiel Puttemans, but got back to his feet and hared back into the race. Which is exactly what Farah did, 44 years later.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/video/2016/aug/14/mo-farah-takes-10000m-gold-video-highlights\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/4qn8g\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2654521\"            data-video-name=\"Farah retains 10,000m title, Phelps wins 23rd Olympic gold \u2013 video highlights\"            data-video-provider=\"BBC\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-57b00ebae4b0178756b5c803\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/ukonly/mainwebsite/2016/08/14/OlympichighlightsSunday3_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/ukonly/webM/2016/08/14/OlympichighlightsSunday3_V6.webm\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/ukonly/HLS/2016/08/14/OlympichighlightsSunday3.m3u8\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/video/2016/aug/14/mo-farah-takes-10000m-gold-video-highlights\">Farah retains 10,000m title, Phelps wins 23rd Olympic gold</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>For ten laps, Farah barely seemed to stretch his legs. He waved to his family in the stands as he came around the second bend, then coasted at the very back of the pack right through the first 1,000m, thinking it the safest place to be. Soon after he decided to make a move, and slid past the field so he could lurk behind the frontrunners. The American runner Galen Rupp was just behind him. And that\u2019s when it happened. \u201cThere was a lot of pushing,\u201d said Rupp, \u201cguys slowing down in front of him.\u201d They collided, and Farah tumbled down to the ground as another runner hurdled over him. For an awful moment, it looked like his race was over.</p> <p>Farah rolled, regained his feet, and regathered his pace. \u201cWhen I fell I was just thinking \u2018try and get back as fast as I can\u2019,\u201d Farah said. \u201cI was thinking \u2018don\u2019t panic, don\u2019t panic, don\u2019t panic\u2019.\u201d Rupp helped. \u201cI wanted to make sure that he was OK first and foremost,\u201d Rupp said, so he turned back and shouted out. Farah flashed a thumb up. He was grateful to Rupp, \u201che is a great sportsman\u201d. Rupp then told him \u201cjust get behind me\u201d and they set off again, Farah asking himself \u201cis the race done? Is the race done? No, no, no.\u201d Farah explained that he had promised his daughter Rihanna a medal \u201cand I wasn\u2019t going to let her down\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"01f52bb27e331a514f855b8c1139a44bb91f1d0a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/01f52bb27e331a514f855b8c1139a44bb91f1d0a/0_109_3796_2278/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Farah\u2019s wife Tania Nell and daughter Rihanna celebrate in Rio.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Farah\u2019s wife Tania Nell and daughter Rihanna celebrate in Rio.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Shaun Botterill/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cIf it happened with five laps to go I think the race would have been over,\u201d Farah said. But he had time to recover. And besides, it all happened so quickly that there was hardly time for the other runners up front to realise what had happened. He was desperately worried that they would spot the chance to and accelerate away. \u201cI was hoping the guys didn\u2019t see me fall at the front,\u201d he said. The three Kenyans, Tanui, Bedan Muchri, and Geoffrey Kamworor did hit the front in a bunch, but by then Farah was already up on their heels. They tried to block him off, but eventually split, and Ethiopia\u2019s Yigram Demalesh took the race on into the final few laps.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/13/greg-rutherford-olympic-long-jump-rio-2016\">Greg Rutherford wins long jump bronze but says medal is a bitter pill</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Vir\u00e9n once said that \u201cit is the mental side which can be the deciding factor\u201d in any race. He liked to a Finnish word, sisu, which has no exact translation in English, but which he defined as \u201cthe ability to endure and overcome any pain and challenge through mental strength\u201d. Farah may not know it, but he showed it. His mental strength comes from his faith in his kick over the last 400m, when all the biomechanical work he has done with Alberto Salazar really starts to show. Salazar taught Farah how to increase the number of steps he takes without cutting down his long stride, which eats up two-and-a-quarter metres of track. That gives him an edge over everyone else. He knows it, and so do they.</p> <p>In full flow Farah looks such a natural, but his technique has in fact been calibrated with scientific precision. He lands on the balls of his feet, places his front foot precisely beneath his knee so that he keeps his centre of balance, and quickly whips his trailing leg up towards his back to cut the distance that it has to travel before it\u2019s ready for its next stride. That\u2019s why Farah can fly. Tanui tried to take him on. He took the lead at the bell and kept it for much of the final lap. But Farah pulled up to him and then kicked on again coming around the last bend. He last lost a major championship race at the World Championships in 2011. They\u2019ve been trying to find a way to beat him for five years now, and they still haven\u2019t done it.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 15 August 2016. An earlier version said the Finnish word susi could be defined as \u201cthe ability to endure and overcome any pain and challenge through mental strength\u201d. That word is sisu.</p>",

In the meantime, read how Justin Gatlin impressed in the heats:</em></p> <p>Yet all of a sudden everyone, from Coe to the watching volunteers and the crowd, was smiling. As he pushed his way through the media presence that quadruples every time he appears, Bolt added: \u201cI\u2019m feeling good, I\u2019m happy. Now it\u2019s all about execution and getting it right when it comes to the finals. There are going to be some fast semi-finals.\u201d</p> <p>The fastest qualifier, for what it\u2019s worth at this stage of the competition, was Gatlin. The American, hamfistedly cast as the twice-banned bogeyman to Bolt\u2019s saviour at the Beijing world championships last year where he lost out by a fraction, was also heartily cheered.</p> <p>\u201cIt was easy, man. Controlled the race from the beginning, stayed strong. I feel the best I have all season,\u201d he said after a time of 10.01 in a race in which he was easing down for the last 20 metres.</p> <p>Inevitably, Gatlin was asked again about his USA team-mate <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/10/lilly-king-unrepentant-calling-out-drug-cheats\">Lilly King\u2019s comments </a>last week. In the midst of rising rhetoric about a new sporting cold war in the pool, King hit out not only at Russian rival Yulia Efimova but her own team-mates.</p> <p>\u201cDo I think people who have been caught doping should be on the team? They shouldn\u2019t,\u201d she said. \u201cIt is just something that needs to be set in stone.\u201d</p> <p>A hitherto relaxed Gatlin, who has not reproduced the consistent excellence of last season but still believes he can win here, stiffened slightly.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t even know who Lilly King is. She does swimming and not track and field, so I\u2019m not worried about that. I have confidence in my own policies,\u201d said the twice-banned sprinter, who continues to divide opinion between those who believe he has served his time and those who bristle at his presence.</p> <p>\u201cUsada has done a great job, Wada has done a great job. I\u2019ve come back and done what I need to do. I\u2019ve worked hard just like everyone else,\u201d he added.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/13/olympic-games-rio-athletics-100m-usain-bolt-justin-gatlin\">Usain Bolt arrives to lift the Rio fans but finds Justin Gatlin has the legs</a> </p> </aside> </div>   </div>"
