The Mid-Staffs NHS Foundation Inquiry, known as the Francis Inquiry, in 2013 also recommended a statutory duty of candour with criminal sanctions for professionals and managers who mislead the public. That duty of candour has now been adopted within the NHS.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/12/andy-burnham-hillsborough-law-policing-and-crime-bill\">Andy Burnham to call for 'Hillsborough law' for bereaved families</a> </p> </aside>  <p>A recent report by the Equalities and Human Rights Commission about deaths among detained adults with mental health conditions recommended that a duty of candour similar to the NHS regulations be extended to prisons, police stations and mental health institutions. </p> <p>Pete Weatherby QC, one of the authors of the draft bill, said: \u201cThere was a problem of pervasive institutional defensiveness, a culture of denial [during the inquest].

  "<p>It is illegal to be drunk in a pub, MPs are forbidden from wearing armour in parliament and all beached whales or sturgeons caught in UK waters belong to the crown.</p> <p> A list of the 10 most bizarre British laws has been compiled by a Cambridge researcher to highlight the complexity and antiquity of statutes that remain in force.</p> <p>The ranking of the top 10 \u201cweirdest\u201d laws was assembled by Christopher Sargeant, a PhD student at the University of Cambridge. </p> <p>Some strange prohibitions may be familiar to lawyers or specialists. The ban on importing potatoes from Poland without written notification \u2013 a requirement dating back only to 2004 to combat outbreaks of ring rot \u2013 may only be a surprise to those outside agriculture. </p> <p>The fact that all whales and sturgeons found in the UK belong to the crown is by virtue of the Prerogativa Regis of 1322. The medieval statute is thought to have reflected the desire of King Edward II to control conspicuous consumption. As recently as 2004, the study notes, Robert Davies caught a 9lb sturgeon off the coast of Wales which he offered to the Queen. <br></p> <p>Section 12 of the 1872 Licensing Act declares that \u201cevery person found drunk \u2026 on any licensed premises, shall be liable to a penalty\u201d. It was enacted to reduce consumption of alcohol and to encourage sobriety among the poor. It remains in force within England and Wales as a rule prohibiting public drunkenness.</p> <p>The Metropolitan Police Act 1839 makes it an offence for any person to carry any cask, tub, hoop, wheels, ladders, planks or poles on a footway \u201cexcept for the purpose of loading or unloading any cart or carriage\u201d. It was passed to ensure people could move freely along public thoroughfares without obstruction.</p> <p>MPs are prohibited from wearing armour in parliament by the Bearing of Armour Act which dates back to 1313. It was an attempt by Edward II to prevent nobles from threatening to use force when parliament was called. The Earl of Lancaster, it was reported, still attended parliament carrying weapons until at least 1319. </p> <p> The other five unusual regulations highlighted by Sargeant are: a different part of the 1872 Licensing Act that outlaws being drunk in charge of cattle; the 1986 Salmon Act \u2013 intended to ban poaching \u2013 which makes it illegal to handle salmon in suspicious circumstances; a 19th-century law banning the beating of carpets after 8am on streets in London; Transport for London rules that prevent queue-jumping in tube stations; and a 2005 law that prohibits activating burglar alarms without nominating a key-holder to turn them off.</p> <p>The study was commissioned by an insurance firm, Privilege Home Insurance, which questions whether such obscure laws are necessary and calls for many to be repealed. </p> <p>Sargeant, who is studying at Cambridge University\u2019s faculty of law, said: \u201cGiven its rich and varied legal history, it is inevitable that the UK has had its fair share of weird and wonderful laws. This reflects that even the oldest laws can still serve a key purpose (even if this is not always immediately obvious) or that such rules may be maintained for symbolic reasons.\u201d</p> <p>The Law Commission, responsible for pruning the statute book, does regularly recommend the removal of outdated regulations. The Unlawful Games Act 1541, which required every Englishman aged between 17 and 60 to keep a longbow and practise archery on a regular basis, was repealed in 1960.</p> <p>The Law Commission itself has also collected a <a href=\"http://www.lawcom.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Legal_Oddities.pdf\">list of odd laws and legal myths</a> which includes several of Sargeant\u2019s favourites and points out that the tradition that it is illegal to stand within 100 yards of the monarch without wearing socks is not true.</p>",
  "<p>Online groomers rarely pose as children and can succeed in persuading a child to meet in less than half an hour, according to researchers probing the way in which sexual predators target victims online.</p> <p>The UK-based research team behind the findings say they hope to overturn common misconceptions about how online groomers operate in a bid to help parents protect their children. They suggest the research could also aid the development of better software programmes to catch online predators.</p> <p>\u201cIf we really want to prevent [grooming] and to help children and to keep them safe, we really need to go back to basics and really analyse what is actually going on in online grooming communication,\u201d said Cristina Izura, a psychologist at the University of Swansea, who co-directs the the Online Grooming Communication (OGC) project. </p> <p>Presented at the British Science Festival, the findings come from studies carried out by the OGC, a project that aims to investigate the language that groomers use to trap children into sexually abusive situations. </p> <p>\u201cIt is how the groomers communicate and interact with their victims, with the children that they target, that we are interested in,\u201d said Professor Nuria Lorenzo-Dus, also a director of the OGC project. </p> <p>The researchers examined instant messaging chat logs from US-based organisation <a href=\"http://www.perverted-justice.com/\">Perverted Justice Foundation Inc</a> that involved communications between adults posing as children - typically young teenage girls - and online groomers, who were unaware that they were actually interacting with an adult.</p> <p>The results, the researchers say, dispel a number of misconceptions about online groomers, including the idea that they always pose as children, and that grooming is a lengthy process.</p> <p>From two studies involving a total of more than 250 groomers, none of the predators were found to be masquerading as children. \u201cA huge percentage of them say the age they are,\u201d said Izura. \u201cWe had a range of ages between 18 and 65, the real age, and the [stated] age was between 16 years of age to 61.\u201d</p> <p>Another finding, say the researchers, is that online grooming can be very rapid, with analysis of chat logs revealing that it can take just 18 minutes for some predators to arrange to meet their victim. \u201cThe speed can be alarmingly fast, \u201d said Izura. The fastest, says Lorenzo-Dus used sophisticated, persuasive, language-based strategies to build trust rapidly, including the use of small talk and praise.</p> <p>But, says Lorenzo-Dus, there is not one kind of online groomer, but different profiles that use different ways of grooming children communicatively. Online grooming, she adds, is complex, involving trust-building, isolation and desensitisation towards sexual behaviour. \u201cIn online grooming we are talking about a network of processes and strategies that do not follow always the same order,\u201d she added. \u201c[It] is an entrapment network.\u201d</p> <p>The team behind the OGC project hope the studies will enable the development of better software to detect online groomers, adding that the research could also help parents and carers to protect their children.</p> <p> \u201cIf we don\u2019t understand what the tactics are, we cannot really identify them when children may be implicitly referring to us about the kind of things they get up to when they are interacting online with others,\u201d said Lorenzo-Dus. <br></p> <p>While Lorenzo-Dus says it is unrealistic to stop children using the internet or closely monitor their digital activities, she believes talking about what they do online is important. \u201cIt is not enough to just ask them once what they do online. It is something that should be more frequently brought up in discussions in the family, in school, in any context like that,\u201d she said.</p> <p>A <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/jun/21/internet-used-in-eight-cases-of-child-sex-abuse-every-day-nspcc-finds\">National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children</a> (NSPCC) spokesman said: \u201cChildren are increasingly contacting ChildLine telling us that they are being targeted in this way, so parents need to talk to their children about online safety and take steps such as installing parental controls or limiting the time they spend on the internet.</p> <p>\u201cIn 2015 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/mar/15/police-powerless-grooming-law-child-safety-experts-warn\">a change in the law</a>, as a result of NSPCC campaigning, banned adults from knowingly sending sexual messages to children, as a prelude to carrying out sexual abuse. It\u2019s quite incredible that a year after this new legislation was passed it has still not been implemented, at a time when police are under crushing pressure to tackle this type of crime.</p> <p>\u201cWe hope these insights into how predatory adults groom children online will help educate young people about staying safe, and assist the police in catching offenders.\u201d </p>",

  "<p>Well before Oscar Pistorius was first granted leave by the International Athletics Federation to compete in the Olympics, sports fans had questioned whether disabled athletes would ever outcompete their able-bodied counterparts.</p> <p>At the 2012 Olympics in London, Pistorious became the first double-leg amputee to compete at both the Olympics and Paralympics.&#xa0;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/aug/04/oscar-pistorius-400m-heat-olympics\">Finishing second in his heat</a>, he did, in fact, beat several able-bodied competitors. Other athletes to compete in both the Olympics and the Paralympics include archers, table tennis players, swimmers and equestrians. Nevertheless, no disabled athlete has ever won a medal at&#xa0;both the Olympic and Paralympic games. Consequently, with technology constantly advancing, people continue to wonder how long it will be until disabled competitors will come to dominate a sport.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/06/the-guardian-view-on-the-paralympics-focus-on-ability-not-disability\">The Guardian view on the Paralympics: focus on ability, not disability | Editorial</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Well, wonder no longer, it has been happening for years in athletics distance events. In fact, in every distance race further than 400m, the world record times of wheelchair athletes are faster than their able-bodied counterparts.</p> <p>Times for the marathon present the most stark difference. The men\u2019s able-bodied world-record time is two hours and three minutes compared with the fastest official wheelchair time of one hour 20 minutes. Even over 800m Marcel Hug\u2019s record of one minute 31.12 seconds is almost 10 seconds faster than David Rudisha\u2019s London 2012 world-record winning time of one minute 40.91 seconds. Similar trends hold for the women\u2019s world records, although the differences are less pronounced.</p> <p>In both men\u2019s and women\u2019s events the fastest wheelchair racers are in the&#xa0;<a href=\"https://www.paralympic.org/world-records/athletics\">T54 category</a>. Athletes in T54 have normal arm muscle power and have partial-to-normal trunk control. T54 competitors include Britain\u2019s David Weir, a four-time Paralympic gold medallist at the London 2012 Olympics in distances from 800m up to the marathon. T54 also boasts Hug, the man with the astounding achievement of being world record holder in the 800m, 1,500m, 5,000m and 10,000m. The thought of able-bodied athletes dominating over such a wide range of distances is inconceivable.<br></p> <p>How is it that a single athlete can dominate over such a wide range of race distances? As the distance of a race increases it is reasonable to expect that the average speed at which the racer travels should decrease. This is true for all distances over 200m (in which wheelchair racers are significantly hampered by their slow starts) for both able-bodied and wheelchair racers. However, wheelchair racers&#xa0;<a href=\"http://sport.maths.org/content/wheelchair-racing\">maintain their average speed much better</a>.</p> <p>At 400m the average speed for the world record wheelchair race was 8.88 metres per second (mps). Astonishingly this drops to only 8.77 mps over the 26.22 miles of a marathon. For able-bodied athletes the corresponding drop in speed is from 9.30 mps (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/14/wayde-van-niekerk-olympic-gold-400m-world-record\">Wayde van Niekerk\u2019s Rio 2016 world record</a>) to 5.72 mps (<a href=\"https://www.iaaf.org/news/report/marathon-world-record-dennis-kimetto-berlin\">Dennis Kimetto\u2019s record 2014 Berlin marathon time</a>). It seems, in wheelchair racing, that if you are fast, you can be fast over all distances.</p> <p>This may be the case but why, in these middle to long-distance races, do wheelchair racers enjoy such an advantage over their able-bodied rivals? The answer is largely technological. In the same manner as a bike, a wheelchair is a machine which can help the athlete using it to move faster than an equivalently athletic runner.</p> <p>For elite racers, wheelchairs are&#xa0;<a href=\"http://www.popularmechanics.com/adventure/sports/a5529/wheelchair-racing-boston-marathon/\">customised to the millimetre</a>. Bespoke aluminium frames are constructed to provide narrow profiles which reduce aerodynamic drag in comparison to able bodied runners. Athletes are positioned in the chairs in order to push as efficiently as possible. On flat or downhill sections of races, athletes are able to coast to recover or conserve energy, whereas able bodied runners must keep expending precious energy even on downhill sections.</p> <p>That being said, it\u2019s not all plain sailing for the wheelchair athletes. Track races require them to negotiate two bends every 400m and bunched conditions make overtaking particularly difficult. Road races \u2013 which have fewer bends and are less crowded \u2013 have their own issues.&#xa0;<a href=\"http://bjsm.bmj.com/content/18/4/301.full.pdf\">Camber on a road can cause athletes to head toward the kerb</a>&#xa0;requiring continual correction, placing increased strain on one arm or the other. Uneven or poorly maintained road surfaces also present problems to wheelchair athletes,&#xa0;<a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/other_sports/disability_sport/8634097.stm\">including the possibility of punctures</a>.</p> <p>Although wheelchair competitors may gain some advantage on significantly downhill courses, for a world record to be ratified the course has to have a minimum decrease in elevation. This is why South African Ernst van Dyk\u2019s one hour 18 minute Boston marathon time is not a true world record. As most cyclists know, on significantly undulating \u201clegal\u201d courses, times are&#xa0;<a href=\"http://www.flacyclist.com/content/perf/compare_routes.html\">almost invariably slower</a>&#xa0;than travelling the same distance on the flat. The increase in speed on downhill sections never makes up for the extra energy expended and the extra time spent pushing up hill.</p> <p>Despite these disadvantages, wheelchair Paralympians continue to outperform their able-bodied counterparts. With further advances in wheelchair technology they will continue to do at this Paralympics and for many more to come.</p> <p>This article was originally published on <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/au\">The Conversation</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Counter\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://counter.theconversation.edu.au/content/64826/count.gif&quot; alt=&quot;The Conversation&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>",
  "<p>Today is Equal Pay Day. It marks the amount of extra time since the end of the financial year it has taken women to earn the same amount as men, based on Australia\u2019s gender pay gap of 16.2%. This year it took women an extra 69 days to catch up. </p> <p>As a society we haven\u2019t made much headway in closing the gender pay gap which has hovered between 15% and 19% for decades. It\u2019s been over 30 years since the Sex Discrimination Act 1984<em> </em>made it illegal to pay a woman less than her male counterparts for the same work. </p> <p>Since then, we\u2019ve seen the fall of the Berlin Wall, the end of apartheid and Australia\u2019s first female prime minister. Yet the gender pay gap persists. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/datablog/2016/aug/27/jennifer-lawrence-and-melissa-mccarthy-make-big-money-but-men-still-make-more\">Jennifer Lawrence and Melissa McCarthy make big money \u2013 but men still make more</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The gender pay gap is <a href=\"https://www.wgea.gov.au/addressing-pay-equity/what-gender-pay-gap\">currently 16.2%</a> as calculated by the ABS. That number is based on a comparison of the full time-equivalent earnings of men and women, taking part time work into account. A few factors help to explain it, including a lack of women in senior positions, differences in education and experience and old fashioned discrimination. </p> <p>Geography plays a role: pay is more equal in the ACT, where the pay gap is 10.7%, than in Western Australia, where it\u2019s 23.9%. The pay gap differs between industries as well. For instance, it\u2019s much worse in finance (30%) than in retail (11.5%). </p> <p>A more complex obstacle is the fact that some industries and occupations are simply paid more. Historically, female-dominated industries such as teaching or social assistance have been paid less than male dominated ones like mining or banking. </p> <p>Australia has some of the world\u2019s best data on pay equity, collected by the Workplace Gender Equality Agency (WGEA). That data has already shown that when bonuses, superannuation and other perks are taken into account, the pay gap rises to 24.7%. </p> <p>There is currently little reliable data in Australia about the pay gap for women of colour or women from culturally and linguistically diverse backgrounds. Overseas, evidence suggests the pay gap for those women is much worse. We do know that for Indigenous women, <a href=\"https://www.melbourneinstitute.com/downloads/hilda/Bibliography/Working_Discussion_Research_Papers/2015/Howlett_etal_Unpacking_the_income_Indigenous_non-Indigenous_WorkingPaper99__Gray_Hunter.pdf\">data from 2011</a> shows that the pay gap is around 33%. </p> <p>The University of Queensland Women\u2019s Collective illustrated this earlier this year with their <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/apr/06/the-feminist-cupcake-sale-that-led-us-into-the-darkest-depths-of-gender-inequality\">Feminist Week \u201cgender pay gap\u201d bake sale</a> which charged students differently based on their (statistically) likely future earnings. </p> <p>These issues may seem intractable, but the Greens have a simple proposal to make a start: abolish pay gag clauses. Last week, I reintroduced a bill to make sure workers can\u2019t be punished for talking to each other about their pay. </p> <p>We know that one of the best ways to end inequality is to throw light on it. Our <a href=\"http://larissa-waters.greensmps.org.au/content/blog/fixing-gender-pay-gap-ending-pay-gag-clauses\">bill will ban pay gag clauses</a> and make existing gag clauses unenforceable. </p> <p>It would make sure that workers are allowed to tell their colleagues what they are paid if they wish to, without fear of retaliation from their boss. The proposed new law would not force anyone to discuss their pay but it would make sure that bosses could not pressure their employees to stay quiet.</p> <p>I experienced this first hand in my very first job at a commercial law firm where the guy sitting next to me was earning $5,000 more than I was. We were doing exactly the same job and we had equal experience since we were both fresh out of university \u2013 where I had got better marks than him! I never would have guessed there was any difference in our pay unless he\u2019d let his salary slip in a casual conversation.</p> <p>Evidence has shown that pay secrecy can help hide discrimination, unconscious bias and bad decision making, such as where two people are paid differently for doing the same job. Pay transparency makes sure employers have to justify pay decisions. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2016/sep/07/why-does-womens-rights-movement-marginalise-women-with-disabilities-nidhi-goyal\">Why does the women's rights movement marginalise women with disabilities? | Nidhi Goyal</a> </p> </aside>  <p>When pay is set in secret by individual negotiation, women are at a disadvantage.

In the coming months, a Senate committee will conduct an inquiry into the bill. This is an opportunity for our leaders, and particularly our women leaders, to come together and start to eliminate this inequality.</p> <p>We can and will disagree on other aspects of fixing the gender pay gap \u2013 like the need to increase government funding for higher pay in childcare, aged care and teaching.

  "<p>A former supreme court law clerk turned US senator warned on Wednesday that Republicans are \u201caiding and abetting in the destruction of the United States supreme court and the rule of law\u201d.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.blumenthal.senate.gov/\">Richard Blumenthal</a> delivered an impassioned plea at the steps to the court where a vacancy on the bench remains unfilled. Barack Obama\u2019s nominee, Merrick Garland, has now been waiting 175 days for a Senate hearing, longer than any other supreme court nominee in US history. </p> <p>For Blumenthal, an ex-federal prosecutor and state attorney who has argued cases before the supreme court, the battle is personal. Describing how he passes the court on Capitol Hill every day, the Democratic senator for Connecticut said: \u201cI can\u2019t help but think that its power is based on a very thin thread of credibility. It has no army, it commands no police force, it\u2019s unelected, its members serve for life. What more undemocratic institution could you imagine?</p> <p>\u201cAnd yet the American people are willing to obey its every order because they have that same respect for it, that it is above politics. The Republicans are dragging this institution into the muck and mire of gridlock and partisan paralysis. They are not only diminishing but greatly endangering this court and that is unforgivable.\u201d</p> <p>Blumenthal added: \u201cThe Republican majority in the United States Senate is aiding and abetting in the destruction of the United States supreme court and the rule of law. It\u2019s really that simple and that grave.\u201d</p> <p>The nine-seat court has been one justice short since the death in February of long-serving conservative <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/feb/13/antonin-scalia-dead-us-supreme-court-justice-obituary\">Antonin Scalia</a>. With four liberals and four conservatives now on the bench, several cases have been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2016/may/16/us-supreme-court-merrick-garland-president-obama-contraception-mandate\">deadlocked or delayed</a>.</p> <p>As senators return to work after a seven-week summer recess, Blumenthal and some Democratic colleagues, along with former judicial clerks to Garland and legal scholars, lined up on Wednesday to urge Republicans to act on the nomination before the presidential election on 8 November. But the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/may/18/mock-confirmation-hearing-merrick-garland-senate-supreme-court\">insists that Obama\u2019s successor</a> must make the pick.</p> <p>Praising Garland, whom he has known for many years, Blumenthal added: \u201cThe irony here is that a completely non-political public servant also has been dragged into the muck and mire of political partisanship.\u201d</p> <p>The standoff comes in an election year in which many voters have expressed frustration at congressional inaction and intransigence, allowing candidates such as Donald Trump, Ted Cruz and Bernie Sanders to thrive.<br></p> <p>Senator <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.booker.senate.gov/\">Cory Booker</a> of New Jersey said: \u201cSo many people now are surrendering to cynicism about Washington. So many people are dismissing what goes on in this town often as \u2018politics as usual\u2019, but I want to make it very clear that this is not usual. This is not ordinary. This is not the regular course of events.</p> <p>\u201cWhat this is is an assault on the very foundations and ideals of our country. It is a betrayal of the ideals of both parties represented here in Washington. What we are seeing now is folks who claim to be in line with conservative values betraying those very ideals. Those who say they are in allegiance with the rule of law betraying those very ideals.</p> <p>\u201cThis is an unprecedented moment in American history. We should sound the alarm because the pathway we are heading down now is dark and destructive.\u201d</p> <p>Senator <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.durbin.senate.gov/\">Dick Durbin</a> of Illinois warned that, with the court due to begin a new session in a few weeks, major legal questions are being left in limbo by the Republican agenda. </p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s an agenda that has really been pushed forward by corporate interests, by Wall Street banks and by the Koch brothers. Let\u2019s call it for what it is. Look at the advertising in the Senate races across the United States. Who\u2019s paying for it? Who is trying to stop the new voices who want to come to the Senate and make a difference and fill the vacancy on the supreme court?\u201d</p> <p>The Democratic nominee, Hillary Clinton, has said she supports the Garland nomination but has declined to commit herself to renominating him if she is elected president. Her rival Donald Trump <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.donaldjtrump.com/press-releases/donald-j.-trump-releases-list-of-names-of-potential-united-states-supreme-c\">has issued a list</a> of conservatives he would consider, encouraging some Republicans to shrug off other concerns about him.</p> <p>Wednesday\u2019s press conference, organised by <a href=\"http://weneednine.org/\">We Need Nine</a>, a White House-allied group, was also addressed by former judicial clerks to Garland including Craig Green, 43, from Philadelphia. He said: \u201cI believe failure to hold those hearings is disgraceful and dangerous.</p> <p>\u201cIn partisan times more than ever, we need to believe that the supreme court and American law are more than political footballs. We need to believe that supreme court nominees are more than \u2018hooray for our team\u2019. It is not a partisan issue to demand hearings for a supreme court nominee after 175 days. Only the worst kinds of partisans and cynics would say something like that.\u201d</p> <p>There is little sign of movement, however. McConnell \u201chas been crystal clear for the last seven months\u201d, <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-court-garland-idUSKCN11C2HM\">an aide to the senator told Reuters</a> on Tuesday. \u201cThe next president will select the nominee.\u201d </p>",
  "<p>Got <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/video/2016/sep/07/mike-ashley-pulls-out-wad-50-notes-during-sports-direct-security-check-video\">a spare 50 quid</a>, Mike Ashley? Do you fancy a bet on your prediction that Keith Hellawell will defy the doubters and regain the support of Sports Direct\u2019s outside shareholders at next year\u2019s annual meeting? This column says it won\u2019t happen.</p> <p>Fund managers are timid creatures by nature but, once roused, tend not to back down. Legal &amp; General\u2019s Sacha Sadan, speaking after outsiders\u2019 53% vote against Hellawell, said the chairman should go immediately \u201cat absolute minimum\u201d. L&amp;G is unlikely to be swayed by the plea that the chairman should be judged with fresh eyes in 12 months\u2019 time.</p> <p>Nobody would pretend it is easy to stand up to a forceful character like Ashley, but Hellawell has been chairman since 2009 and has never demonstrated he is even remotely up to the task. The scandal over working conditions had bubbled away for years, ignored or disregarded by the board. An effective chairman would have seen that Ashley\u2019s siege mentality (bizarrely, he was still <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/sep/07/sports-direct-board-turned-down-chairman-keith-hellawell-resignation\">trying to blame the Unite union</a> for the warehouse scandal on Wednesday) was leading to crisis and would have ensured caution. Instead, Hellawell chose to go to war with outside shareholders over the board\u2019s right to give the billionaire boss a \u00a370m bonus scheme.</p> <p>Similarly, Standard Life probably was not impressed by Hellawell\u2019s claim to have engaged regularly with shareholders. Its representative, Euan Stirling, had just told the annual meeting that Standard Life voted its 5.8% stake against the re-election of all the non-executive directors. One reason was the \u201cunconvincing or non-existent\u201d replies by the board to its inquiries over many years. Standard Life does not sound like a floating voter.</p> <p>Even now, at the moment of supposed reform, Hellawell stood squarely behind the arrangement whereby Ashley\u2019s daughter\u2019s 26-year-old boyfriend, Mike Murray, runs the property team on a contract that could be worth millions and where remuneration for overseeing a \u00a3300m budget is \u201cat the board\u2019s discretion\u201d. Hellawell conceded that \u201cwith the benefit of hindsight\u201d a distribution deal involving Ashley\u2019s brother\u2019s company could have been disclosed in financial reports, but that hardly amounts to an apology, let alone an explanation.</p> <p>Hellawell now cuts a feeble figure. He offered to resign at the weekend, but Ashley would not let him. On Wednesday a majority of outside shareholders said they want him out, but again Ashley blocked the exit. Hellawell can limp on for a year with the founder\u2019s backing, but the reinvention of Sports Direct will be unbelievable until a capable and independent chairman is in place.</p> <h2>The Bank can do no more</h2> <p>Mark Carney is feeling comfortable and serene. Judgments made by the Bank of England before the referendum were accurate, says the governor; and the Bank\u2019s actions after the vote for Brexit, including the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/04/bank-of-england-cuts-uk-interest-rates\">cut in interest rates last month</a>, have helped the economy to adjust. Fair comment?</p> <p>Broadly, yes. Carney\u2019s critics were wrong to accuse him of participating in Project Fear. The Bank is charged with policing financial stability and thus was obliged to make a few judgments about what might happen if the leave campaign won. In another age, silence from Threadneedle Street might have been an option, but not in an era of transparency and scrutiny by the Treasury select committee.</p> <p>Carney was careful to stay neutral in the debate. The contentious remarks were the ones about Brexit being the biggest domestic risk to financial stability, bringing the danger of a \u201cmaterial slowdown in growth\u201d. But that was true at the time, and remains so.</p> <p>Yes, some of the latest data say the economy has rebounded since the vote, but these are early days. On a two-year view, which tends to be the Bank\u2019s horizon, the fallout from Brexit remains almost impossible to assess meaningfully. Leaving the EU may be an opportunity for the UK and our exporters (let\u2019s hope so), but if, like the Bank, you\u2019re in the business of identifying risks to stability, you can\u2019t assume fair weather.</p> <p>The current ray of economic sunshine has brought the charge that the Bank was too hasty in cutting rates. On that score, Carney probably overstated matters in taking credit for stabilising markets. A quarter-point cut in rates is a tweak, after all. But a cut was still the right thing to do. It signalled to investors, businesses and consumers that the UK is not powerless in the face of change.</p> <p>That message will be only be useful, however, if it is also heard by politicians. With interest rates at 0.25%, the Bank has almost exhausted its tool kit. It is up to the government to take advantage of cheap money, by issuing infrastructure bonds or whatever. Carney has made that point, too.</p>",

It said it would suspend the notorious \u201csix strikes and you\u2019re out\u201d policy in its warehouse which meant workers could lose their jobs for relatively minor infringements.</p> <p>At the meeting in Shirebrook, Steve Turner, the assistant general secretary of Unite, said he would not be surprised if only a few workers took up the offer of 12 guaranteed hours a week as most were working much longer shifts.</p> <p>His criticism prompted an angry outburst from Ashley, who blamed the Unite union for the company\u2019s problems.</p> <p>Ashley said: \u201cThis is probably your fault we are in this situation because we can\u2019t talk to you in an open manner.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve made a commitment to make a difference and I\u2019m trying so don\u2019t pull me down.

Without wholesale changes to working conditions, Sports Direct risks finding itself back in the dock.\u201d</p> <p>Speaking after the meeting, Hellawell told the Guardian that Sports Direct\u2019s board had not moved to make changes before the Guardian investigation, despite years of criticisms, because they had not been given correct information about working conditions. </p> <p>\u201cWe were acting on the information we had,\u201d he said. \u201cOne of the biggest disappointments is we found that information was not correct.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Jamie Murray and Bruno Soares remained on course for a return to the doubles final of the US Open on day 10 with a grinding win over the large but nimble Australian Chris Guccione and his partner, Andr\u00e9 S\u00e1.</p> <p>The British-Brazilian team prevailed in their quarter-final 7-6, 2-6, 6-3 in two hours and 23 minutes on a warm but not oppressive day on one of the outside show courts, taking the tie-break 11-9.</p> <p>Guccione is an interesting player. In a three-set qualifier for Wimbledon 10 years ago he struck 50 aces but doubles is where he shines. He and Lleyton Hewitt beat Roger Federer and Stan Wawrinka in a Davis Cup match in 2011 and he partnered Carsten Ball (son of Syd), another US-based Australian, to reach this stage here in 2009, losing to the Bryan brothers.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2016/sep/07/andy-murray-kei-nishikori-us-open-mens-quarter-final-live\">Andy Murray v Kei Nishikori: US Open men's quarter-final \u2013 live!</a> </p> </aside>  <p>So Murray and Soares had plenty to beat. Guccione\u2019s bulk \u2013 6ft 7in and just over 14 stones, according to the official statistics, but looking bigger to the naked eye \u2013 belied a twinkle-toed operator at the net and a neat volley took him and S\u00e1 to deuce in the fourth game, but they could not seal the break on Soares\u2019s serve.</p> <p>Each team had plenty of chances in the first half-hour, but they remained locked at four-all. Not even a remarkable Murray around-the-post winner in the ninth game that stretched Guccione could budge the stasis.</p> <p>Sa, the 39-year-old veteran from Brazil who played with Thomaz Bellucci at the Rio Olympics and put the Murray brothers out in the first round, had the ball in hand at five-all, and held comfortably to shift the pressure across the net.</p> <p>Murray, briefly No1 in the world last year, and Soares have gone off the boil a little after a stunning run, but, seeded fourth, they had a great chance against the Australian/Brazilian outsiders to reach the semi-finals.</p> <p>The responsibility landed on Soares\u2019s racket, and he was staring at the second of two set points when he forced S\u00e1 to hit wide on a big second serve for deuce, and they escaped. They went 3-0 down in the tie-break, and fought back to earn three break points but blew them. As did the unfortunate S\u00e1 on set point, off-balance as his volley ballooned the net. \u201cIt was a battle, the first set was probably the longest I\u2019ve ever played. Bruno served out amazing at the end,\u201d Murray said of the 65 minute-long set.</p> <p>The second could not have been more different. Guccione and S\u00e1 raced to a 4-1 lead and threatened to steamroller their opponents. At 1-5 it seemed possible that Murray would be finished on court 17 in time to dash over to Arthur Ashe, where his brother, Andy, was due to go in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2016/sep/07/andy-murray-kei-nishikori-us-open-mens-quarter-final-live\" title=\"\">early-afternoon quarter-final against Kei Nishikori</a> \u2013 but they managed to stretch it out and regain some control.</p> <p>Murray took a break on the changeover to ease a back strain on what looked like a medical skateboard. When they resumed, S\u00e1 slid an unreachable, angled volley past him into empty space and they went to a decider, where the seedings were finally given credence.</p> <p>Again the crucial serving gig fell to Soares at 5-3 and, with Murray cat-like at the net, they wrapped up their place in the semi-finals to love. They will play the French champions who beat them last year, Pierre-Hugues Herbert and Nicolas Mahut, who defeated Aisam-Ul-Haq Qureshi and Robert Lindstedt 6-3, 7-6 (7-4).</p>",
  "<p>Labour MPs this week voted overwhelmingly to restore their power to <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-37281441\" title=\"\">elect the shadow cabinet</a>, a right they held from the party\u2019s early days until Ed Miliband abolished it in 2011. The motion, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/01/jeremy-corbyn-call-bring-back-shadow-cabinet-elections\" title=\"\">proposed by Clive Betts</a>, was passed by 169 votes to 34 on Tuesday night. It requires Labour\u2019s national executive, which meets next week, to put a rule change to the party conference this month. If that happens, the parliamentary Labour party would elect a new shadow cabinet in the autumn. Labour would be wise to adopt Mr&#xa0;Betts\u2019 proposal. The issue may seem arcane. But its implications are profound.</p> <p>Harold Wilson often described Labour as a broad church. He was right. The party has always been a formal and informal coalition of interests and views. In the old industrial Britain in which the Labour representation committee was created in 1900, Labour\u2019s formal coalition was based on trade unions and socialist societies. Over the years, reflecting social and economic changes of many kinds, individual membership took on greater significance. In the last two decades, much of that institutional and cultural texture has been scrapped in favour of the centralisation of power around the party leader. That was a mistake on many grounds. It should now be carefully undone.</p> <p>Labour badly needs to re-energise its own traditions of coalition and pluralism. The surge of support for Jeremy Corbyn is a powerful part of that process. Even Mr Corbyn\u2019s strongest critics need to recognise that. But it is not the only thing that matters. The party needs, as a whole and as a matter of urgency, to live better with inevitable differences of interest and view. It should do that for reasons of liberal principle and of self-interest. No one who remembers or knows about past divisions, notably <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jul/19/the-fight-for-labours-soul-what-the-partys-brutal-1981-split-means-today\" title=\"\">the breakaway of the Social Democratic party in 1981</a>, should want a return to that. Both the 1981 split itself and the culture of internal bitterness that went with it deprived 1980s Britain of an effective opposition. The need to prevent a repetition is very pressing indeed.</p> <p>Labour will not survive as a coherent potential party of government if one group seeks to obliterate the others. The past 12 months have proved that, as the New Labour era also did. Things cannot and must not go on this way. Labour cannot afford a repetition, whatever the result of the leadership contest. Voters who wish the party well or who rely on the prospect of an alternative government deserve better. For Labour to descend into internal wars about candidate selection \u2013 a live danger when new constituency boundary proposals are published next week \u2013 would be a betrayal.</p> <p>The reintroduction of shadow cabinet elections within the PLP will not solve all these problems at a stroke. But it would be a recognition that one of Labour\u2019s priorities must be to live with itself, so that it can begin the process of becoming an effective opposition and a potential party of government again. That, after all, is what the Conservative party factions are trying to do after the referendum. Labour meanwhile is in denial. Mr Betts, who is not a partisan figure, proposed his motion on the basis that it would be part of a process of coming together after the leadership election. Mr Corbyn should now embrace that approach too.</p> <p>There are many reasons why. First, shadow cabinet elections would enable the leader to put together a better team than he has now. Second, it would be a much needed sign that both sides are prepared to do things differently. Third, the leader would still be able to add some shadow picks of his own choice and would retain control of the distribution of briefs. Fourth, it would make Labour a much more convincing force in parliament and beyond. Fifth, it would respond to the desperate wish for unity and effectiveness among Labour\u2019s members. Sixth, it would send a signal to the non-Labour parts of Britain that Labour wishes to be a party of government, not merely an oppositional movement.</p> <p>Many will view the PLP\u2019s proposal as a power grab. Yet all sides need to move away from seeing everything as a zero-sum game. The change might actually help Mr Corbyn as well as calm his MPs. If&#xa0;he is re-elected, the last thing Mr Corbyn should want is to continue battling with a recalcitrant internal opposition. An elected shadow cabinet might mean he had to work with MPs he has clashed with. But it would also be a sign that they were readier to work with him. Labour needs to move on from a destructive struggle for control. This might at&#xa0;least help to give the party a chance.</p>",
  "<p>Mourning the terminal condition of the political left (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/06/does-the-left-have-a-future\" title=\"\">Does the left have a future?</a>, 6 September) has become something of a parlour game for those who once self-identified as proponents of transformative change. While it may be true that socialism\u2019s less reflective adherents remain tied to an analysis rooted in 20th-century conditions, the majority acknowledge the pressing need to reappraise our approach as work, class identity and the mode of capital accumulation mutate around us.</p> <p>In Scotland, the SNP has superficially triangulated leftwards while legislating from the right, and maintains support by filtering the grievances that John Harris rightly identifies through the prism of national identity politics. Meanwhile Jeremy Corbyn, himself a product of 20th-century socialism, quietly pursues a policy framework that, beyond the babble of his antiquated opponents, attempts to formulate policies of regulation, planning, redistribution and workplace rights suitable for modern conditions which more than ever demand such intervention. A four-day week and universal income are only two of the propositions Labour is likely to commit to by 2020. Add a real living wage, PR and far-reaching constitutional change, and it may be that writing off a Corbyn-led Labour party will in retrospect appear to be one of the more complacent assumptions touted by the liberal press.<br><strong>Mike Cowley</strong><br><em>Campaign for Socialism/Momentum Scotland</em></p> <p>\u2022 John Harris, in trying to envisage a future for the left, imbues the past with some dubious characterisations. The \u201cworking man\u201d was always, understandably, grateful for state benefits when he couldn\u2019t work and, just like any Ukipper now, proud to be patriotic to the core. It is no surprise that Ukip has hoovered up so many Labour votes, as many on the left were and are conservative at heart, and even harboured admiration for Margaret Thatcher, despite her being a woman. More difficult for them was the rise of feminism under New Labour, thus threatening jobs and the status in society that their maleness had conferred upon them. Many of the self-declared \u201cgrafters\u201d who voted to leave the EU would never have done the jobs they claimed migrants deprived them of, but it chimed with the nostalgia for imagined glories of old to be reactivated once freed from Europe\u2019s yoke.</p> <p>It is in this that Scotland is instructive. The SNP is a party led by nationalists, the product of \u201cclever branding\u201d yes, but built on a tide of anti-English rhetoric and empty promises. Sound familiar? Think Johnson, Gove, Farage and the infamous <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/27/eu-referendum-reality-check-leave-campaign-promises\" title=\"\">bus of lies</a>. Then think Corbyn and his <a href=\"http://www.jeremyforlabour.com/work\" title=\"\">10&#xa0;pledges</a>. The future? Men may have to start thinking more like women.<br><strong>Carolyn Kirton</strong><br><em>Aberdeen</em></p> <p>\u2022 John Harris\u2019s take on the left is of the glass-half-empty kind. It is certainly true that the traditional parties of social democracy across Europe have declined in support. They promise to temper the red-in-tooth-and-claw activities of market capitalism by reforms. The problem is that the market system is currently doing rather badly, and the scope for reform is limited even if political office is achieved. France, with a Socialist party government, underlines the point.</p> <p>That means that something a little more robust than simply tweaking capitalism is required, and that surely is what Syriza in Greece and Jeremy Corbyn in the Labour party here are about.</p> <p>It is fair enough to note that this hasn\u2019t been successful yet, but that doesn\u2019t mean the attempt isn\u2019t worthwhile.</p> <p>In the meantime, while Harris says union membership is at \u201can all-time low\u201d (more accurately it is a good deal lower than in the 1970s), the trench warfare against exploitative bosses goes on. As the progress made by Unite the Union <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/sep/06/sports-direct-to-ditch-zero-hours-contracts\" title=\"\">on zero-hours contracts at Sports Direct</a> shows, it&#xa0;is still possible to make the world a better place by collective action.<br><strong>Keith Flett</strong><br><em>London</em></p> <p>\u2022 I enjoyed John Harris\u2019s eloquently insightful analysis of why the left has no effective answers to globalisation, the nationalist right or job insecurity. But I searched in vain for any systemic answers to the problems he posed. A good place to start would be Europe, where the single market, with its ruthless enforcement of \u201copen borders\u201d, has resulted in the rapid rise of EU citizens migrating and the social disruption caused by deregulation, privatisation and post-2008 continent-wide austerity cuts. Small wonder this has led to the rise of politically swift-footed, populist rightwing parties, with their anti-EU and in some cases protectionist policies.</p> <p>It is time for disparate leftwing protests against, for example, TTIP, tax dodgers such as Apple, the dumping of Chinese steel exports, and burgeoning foreign ownership of property, to realise that these are all problems that can only be tackled fundamentally by reversing the free flow of goods, capital and services, and putting this on a par with the political number one issue \u2013 the free flow of people. Given the debacle of the present \u201cNo Plan B\u201d Brexit discussions, it is time to initiate a debate in Europe about how to get us out of this mess. For starters a debate should begin about turning the Treaty of Rome into a \u201c<a href=\"http://www.progressiveprotectionism.com/wordpress/Download/Treaty-of-Home_ColinHines.pdf\" title=\"\">Treaty of Home</a>\u201d, to allow appropriate restrictions to the free movement of goods, people, services and capital, to allow regional, national and local economies to prosper.<br><strong>Colin Hines</strong><br><em>East Twickenham, Middlesex </em></p> <p><strong><em>\u2022 Join the debate \u2013 email </em></strong><a href=\"mailto:guardian.letters@theguardian.com\" title=\"\"><strong><em>guardian.letters@theguardian.com</em></strong></a></p>",
  "<p>Professor Colin Green (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/sep/06/pope-should-know-that-resisting-birth-control-is-bad-for-the-environment\" title=\"\">Letters</a>, 7 September) makes a classic first-world myopic error in believing that the rise in human population is mainly responsible for the impending ecological crisis. It is not numbers of people per se damaging the planet, but frenetic consumption in the wealthy world that lies behind anthropogenic climate change. You can curb family sizes in poor countries all you like \u2013 if you have the moral stomach for such gross colonialism and denial of essential human freedoms \u2013 but the ecological crisis will remain as long as we live the way we do in the rich world.</p> <p>As Pope Francis puts it in his ecological teaching document, Laudato Si\u2019: \u201cTo&#xa0;blame population growth instead of extreme and selective consumerism on the part of some, is one way of refusing to face the issues. It is an attempt to legitimise the present model of distribution, where a minority believes that it has the right to consume in a way which can never be universalised, since the planet could not even contain the waste products of such consumption.\u201d</p> <p>He does not, however, deny population is a factor in the environment, noting that \u201cattention needs to be paid to imbalances in population density, on both national and global levels, since a rise in consumption would lead to complex regional situations\u201d. But the general point is clear: you do not heal the damage to the planet by eliminating the poor. As Francis says: \u201ca true ecological approach always becomes a social approach; it must integrate questions of justice in debates on the environment, so as to hear both the cry of the earth and the cry of the poor.\u201d<br><strong>Dr Austen Ivereigh</strong><br><em>Coordinator, Catholic Voices</em></p> <p>\u2022 While I am enthused by Pope Francis\u2019s recent calls for environmental destruction to be classified as a sin (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/01/pope-francis-calls-on-christians-to-embrace-green-agenda\" title=\"\">Report</a>, 1 September), I do wonder if a more nuanced perspective is required. Is it right to classify certain behaviours that cause ecological harm as sin, if there is a lack of knowledge, capacity and choice to take alternative, more environmentally friendly courses of action?</p> <p>For example, is it fair to say I have sinned if I have to&#xa0;drive my gas-guzzling car in the city because of an absence of safe and coordinated cycle infrastructure? Is it fair to say I have sinned if I have to deal with the vast amounts of waste forced upon me by retailers? Or if I depend on oil because alternatives are not provided, or are too expensive? Perhaps the sin lies not with the individual, but instead with the failure by government and policymakers to adequately inform on the issues, and provide structures and incentives for pro-environmental behaviour.<br><strong>Catherine Devitt</strong><br><em>Jesuit Centre for Faith and Justice, Dublin </em></p> <p><strong><em>\u2022 Join the debate \u2013 email </em></strong><a href=\"mailto:guardian.letters@theguardian.com\" title=\"\"><strong><em>guardian.letters@theguardian.com</em></strong></a></p>",

Why did she not bring back selection at 11 years old?</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/06/grammar-schools-social-mobility-theresa-may-early-years\">Grammar schools don\u2019t help social mobility \u2013 we need to start earlier | Melissa Benn</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The answer is that Thatcher was wary of political suicide \u2013 at least until the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/gnm-archive/gallery/2015/mar/28/poll-tax-riots-revisited-in-pictures\" title=\"\">poll tax</a>. When she became education secretary in 1970, she found a poll in her Finchley constituency running at 80% against a return to selection. Plenty of Tories loved grammars, as most had been to them. But since 1944, admission had been by a supposedly objective \u201cintelligence\u201d test, not an academic exam. For the first time, middle-class children were being excluded from their ancestral schools in favour of at least a few \u201cbright\u201d working-class ones.</p> <p>Thatcher\u2019s shadow education predecessor, Edward Boyle, had been roasted at meeting after meeting by furious Tories whose children had \u201cfailed\u201d the 11-plus and found themselves dumped in secondary moderns. Boyle struggled to promise no return to the 11-plus, but it wrecked his career. He was one of Thatcher\u2019s few political friends.</p> <p>The argument was and still is surrounded by mendacious noise. Under selection there is no such thing as parental choice, any more than there could be \u201ca grammar school for all\u201d. But from the 1970s onwards, the politics of state education, at least in the big cities, reflected the striving of some middle-class parents to \u201cget our schools back\u201d.</p> <p>This led ministers of both parties to seek various centrist dodges, from assisted places and city technology colleges to specialist schools, academies and free schools \u2013 all as a means of separating so-called good schools from \u201csink\u201d ones. Each was code for academic and/or social segregation. It was often astronomically expensive. In 2006 Bexley\u2019s new academy was reported to have cost \u00a350m. Michael Gove in 2014 had to raid the school \u201cspecial needs\u201d budget of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/may/10/gove-lunatic-raid-free-schools\" title=\"\">\u00a3400m for his&#xa0;ailing free schools</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"be4730fbb94b36e53255949f8262f276327f873d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/be4730fbb94b36e53255949f8262f276327f873d/0_0_3498_4933/709.jpg\" alt=\"Margaret Thatcher in 1982: \u2018When she became education secretary in 1970, she found a poll in her Barnet constituency running at 80% against a return to selective education.\u2019\" width=\"709\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Margaret Thatcher in 1982: \u2018When she became education secretary in 1970, she found a poll in her Finchley constituency running at 80% against a return to selective education.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bride Lane Library/Popperfoto/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Meanwhile entry to these \u201cWhitehall\u201d schools and the 163 remaining grammars&#xa0;(which Thatcher did save) drifted from the theoretical purity of the old 11-plus. Entry tests were made \u201ccrammable\u201d, boosting parental involvement and seeing a cottage industry in tutoring in selective counties such as Kent. The money was worth it. Middle-class parents in Kent now either get into a local grammar or flee to the private sector. Today\u2019s grammar schools are \u201cfee-paying\u201d by a different name.</p> <p>As for the idea that \u201cjust a few\u201d grammar schools would not harm the system, the chief inspector, Michael Wilshaw, could not be more dismissive. He said last week that setting and streaming were one thing, but returning&#xa0;to institutional segregation at 11, \u201cwhere we only expect some kids to do well\u201d, would be disastrous and retrograde. Every grammar school \u201cmeans three secondary moderns, and no one is queueing to go to them\u201d. As a&#xa0;former head of a London comprehensive, he would also have been \u201cabsolutely furious\u201d to find the best 20% of pupils creamed off.</p> <p>Two decades of that favourite ministerial bloodsport, tearing up school structures, has failed to deliver. Alice Sullivan of London\u2019s Institute of Education declares: \u201cThere is no robust evidence that any particular structure \u2026 is beneficial for improving the performance of poor pupils.\u201d Academies do not outperform local authority schools. Some do, some don\u2019t. What happens in the classroom is what matters, not what happens in governors\u2019 meetings.</p> <p>The argument over selection nowadays applies almost exclusively to urban schools, since out-of-town comprehensives are barely controversial. There is usually just one community secondary. But in cities the debate has bite. This is because most parents naturally want their children to go to school with other children (and parents) like themselves. It is a concern <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2015/sep/10/future-conditional-review-rob-brydon-tamsin-oglesby-education\" title=\"\">well satirised</a> in Tamsin Oglesby\u2019s play, Future Conditional, last year at the Old Vic.</p> <p>While such concern is understandable, there is no evidence that a comprehensive system delivers worse results overall \u2013 and clear evidence that, for poor children, selective systems are worse. The reality is that the top end of British secondary education is not at all bad. It is the bottom that is dire.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/sep/05/michael-wilshaw-ofsted-chief-grammar-schools-theresa-may-poorer-children\">Ofsted chief warns May over 'retrograde step' of grammar schools</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Nor is this a function of the curse of the debate, immigration. The evidence suggests that high-achieving migrants have <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/2016/06/02/schools-with-large-numbers-of-eu-students-perform-better/\" title=\"\">led the recovery</a> in London\u2019s schools in recent years. The only coherent answer is to concentrate not on structure but resources. It is teaching, equipment and, above all, leadership that make a difference to a school.</p> <p>The argument about selection is more about social policy than education. Schools financed by the state should be social integrators, not dividers. Grammars are dividers. Gove may have deserved praise for caring about standards, but his ideological obsession with selective free schools and dodgy academies was a disaster.</p> <p>As for faith schools, seeking to replicate in England the religious divisions of Northern Ireland, with Muslims and Christians instead of Catholics and Protestants, must be reckless. These days, faith-based education should be&#xa0;social anathema. And as for currying favour with the Tory right, merely chipping off a few secondary schools and turning them into de facto adjuncts of the private sector cannot make educational or financial sense.</p> <p>The answer must remain with local control \u2013 if not of schools then at least of their intake. Intake is all, because it is the chief determinant of performance.</p> <p>Theresa May is playing with fire. When last year George Osborne attempted to nationalise every school in&#xa0;the land, it was Tory local councils that rose in fury and stopped him. To whom did he think their schools belonged? In an open society, schools are the melting pots of community tension. Their task should be to mitigate local division, not promote it. In the last century, collective secondary education in Britain was a true social advance, a revolution on a par with the Victorians\u2019 education for all. Going backwards should be unthinkable.</p> <p>The prime minister should let this dream pass. Perhaps she should rehearse a more honest slogan than \u201cBring back the grammars\u201d. She should try, \u201cBring back the secondary moderns\u201d. That should wake things up.</p>",

That is how to approach it.</p> <p>\u201cIt would not be right for me or this government to give a running commentary on negotiations.\u201d</p> <p>Immediately after prime minister\u2019s questions, May made a statement to the Commons on this week\u2019s G20 summit in Hangzhou, China, beginning with an update on the Brexit process.</p> <p>While giving no more details, she promised a specific British variant on non-membership association with the EU, one that would be \u201cambitious and bold\u201d.</p> <p>She said: \u201cIt is not about the Norway model or the Swiss model or any other country\u2019s model \u2013 it is about developing our own British model.</p> <p>\u201cSo we will not take decisions until we are ready. We will not reveal our hand prematurely and we will not provide a running commentary on every twist and turn of the negotiation. And I say that because that is not the best way to conduct a strong and mature negotiation that will deliver the best deal for the people of this country.\u201d</p> <p>In response, Corbyn said it was clear there had been a lack of planning for a Brexit vote. \u201cThe prime minister said she wouldn\u2019t reveal her hand on this subject. Nobody would blame her because she hasn\u2019t revealed her hand or indeed any of the government\u2019s many hands. They\u2019re unclear on what they\u2019re trying to do,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cWe accept the decision taken by the majority of our people but we cannot ignore the fact that the outcome has left this country divided, with rising levels of hate crime, huge uncertainty about what comes next for our country, the extraordinary lack of planning and preparation.\u201d</p> <p>Corbyn said negotiations \u201cmust focus on expanding trade jobs and investments and defending social and environmental protection\u201d.</p> <p>During prime minister\u2019s questions, Corbyn chose not to take the <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/07/jeremy-corbyn-challenge-brexit-plans-pmqs-owen-smith\">advice from his leadership challenger</a>, Owen Smith, to press May on the Brexit deal, instead asking a series of questions on housing, some again submitted by voters.</p> <p>May dealt with the specific queries neutrally, but interspersed her answers with a series of scripted jibes at Corbyn and Labour.</p> <p>After Corbyn mentioned a question put by one voter, May quoted one Twitter response the Labour leader had received to a request for possible subjects, saying that \u201cin a recent poll on who would make a better prime minister, \u2018don\u2019t know\u2019 scored higher than Jeremy Corbyn\u201d.</p> <p>May added: \u201cWhat we do know is that whoever wins the Labour party leadership, we\u2019re not going to let them anywhere near power again.\u201d</p> <p>It later emerged that the Twitter user she was quoting \u2013 Lewis Collins \u2013 had made a series of unpleasant remarks on Twitter, including apparently racist comments about recent attacks on Polish people in Essex.</p> <p>A spokesman for Corbyn\u2019s leadership campaign said: \u201cJeremy was raising a very serious question about the housing crisis and Theresa May chose to respond with a pre-written joke quoting someone who has used racist language on Twitter. If this is the level of research she does for PMQs, it\u2019s no wonder the Tories had no plan for Brexit.\u201d</p> <p>Following another question, May made reference to Corbyn\u2019s much-publicised <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/aug/23/jeremy-corbyn-virgin-trains-disputes-claim-over-lack-of-seats\">disagreement with Virgin Trains</a> over whether or not a service he took to Newcastle was full.</p> <p>\u201cEverything he says just tells us all we need to know about modern Labour,\u201d May said. \u201cThe train has left the station, the seats are all empty, the leader\u2019s on the floor.

And secondly the fact the firm rejected Chairman Dr Keith Hellawell\u2019s resignation. Shareholders have long felt that the firm is held too tightly under Mike Ashley\u2019s grip and Chairman Hellawell has been unable to wield the sufficient power needed to make the radical changes required.

But the document was billed as forming the basis of a supposed new era of candour from the company, before investors were led off to see for themselves.</p> <p>The show, however, was a disappointment. This was not a tour of the huge, bustling, Shirebrook warehouse where Guardian undercover reporters revealed last year how the company had broken the law by paying its workers less than the national minimum wage.</p> <p>Instead, the crowd of about 120 observers, all dressed in bright yellow hi-vis jackets, were shown around Sports Direct\u2019s spacious new facility, gleaming white walls and all. It even smelled new and freshly painted \u2013 meaning it was tempting to conclude that shareholders were actually witnessing a whitewash at the workhouse.</p> <p>Despite the pledges of a new transparency, the spectators barely saw any of Sports Direct\u2019s 4,000 warehouse workers (had they been abolished along with the \u201csix strikes and you\u2019re out\u201d policy?).

  "<p>Build a wall \u2026 A great wall. But will it be high enough, big enough, thick enough? Will it be Trump-size, visible from space? Will it keep out the undesirables ? Will it protect the lorry drivers and nervous holidaymakers? Will it look nice if we put a few plants around it? Are the French going to raze the Jungle to the ground just as they did Sangatte?</p> <p>I do not know whether Robert Goodwill, the immigration minister who announced the grand folly of a \u00a31.9m wall in Calais \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/06/uk-immigration-minister-confirms-work-will-begin-on-big-new-wall-in-calais\">\u201cWe\u2019ve done the fences, now we are doing a wall\u201d</a> \u2013 has a clue what he is talking about but this is part of a \u00a317m security package that \u201cwe\u201d are partaking in with the French to tackle the problem of the camp in Calais. This is the ultimate in closed thinking.</p> <p>Walls, barriers, boundaries, borders, blockades: these are structures that make us feel in control, but in the end remind us only of chaos. This is part of the Brexit mentality, part but not all. There is another part that means opening up to a world beyond Europe and righteous Remainers should be wary of constructing even more walls around their own arguments, which seem to outdo each other in convincing us that everything will be terrible for ever.</p> <p>The result of this on the left \u2013 except among those with a vivid enough imagination to actually envisage Jeremy Corbyn shambling down the G20 red carpet in China \u2013 is political paralysis. No more pessimism of the intellect, optimism of the will, but pessimism about everything. This a truly dangerous place to be. I understand the feeling: the world is going to hell in a handcart, so there is nothing to be done. It is a form of paralysis solved only by moving to places where nothing ever happens: New Zealand, Canada \u2026 Failing that, we make little walls around ourselves. Cosy up as the nights draw in and try not to think. About anything. </p> <p>Strangely, though, the best cure for such a feeling is the opposite. It is getting involved with people who do work to change the lives of others, who make movement possible, whose very work is to pull down barriers not erect them.</p> <p>This was made clear to me by Undocumented, an <a href=\"https://www.doctorsoftheworld.org.uk/blog/entry/undocumented-photo-exhibition-marks-10-years-of-london-clinic\">exhibition celebrating 10 years of a Bethnal Green clinic run by Doctors of the World</a> which is used by migrants locked out of the healthcare system. In reality, everyone in the UK should be able to access healthcare. One of the myths is that this is what people come here for. The reality is that, if you are homeless and don\u2019t have a national insurance number, you can\u2019t access it.</p> <p>Sarah (pictured above) explained this to me. She is from South Africa where she had been <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/africa/crisis-in-south-africa-the-shocking-practice-of-corrective-rape-aimed-at-curing-lesbians-9033224.html\">\u201ccorrectionally\u201d raped</a>. Men, she said, had come to \u201cfix\u201d her because of her sexuality. She became pregnant and HIV positive. She could not get a GP but the clinic helped her. And there she was, beaming in front of photographs of herself despite her horrific story. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"d99349556fb77b56bd4d4dfb462499b9208213d2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d99349556fb77b56bd4d4dfb462499b9208213d2/0_172_1181_709/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ibrahim Doctors of the World\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ibrahim, a former Doctors of the World service user who is now training to practise as UK GP.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Toby Coulson</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>A man, Ibrahim Muyhayer, who was a doctor in the Sudanese army but had to leave because of the political volatility, told me how it had taken him five years to access the system. He was charged \u00a32,000 for an ultrasound scan for his pregnant wife though he was earning \u00a350 a week. Now he volunteers in the clinic and is retraining to practise as a doctor here.</p> <p>This basic ethos of treating medical need, whatever the patient\u2019s immigration status, is what this charity does. This is why it also runs clinics in Calais and works with refugees in Greece.</p> <p>Users of the clinic often carry stories of awful suffering, torture, loss and rape, but this is the only service providing primary healthcare. Tearing down the barriers. It was the same in Calais. Unlike the immigration minister, I have been to the camps. It would take him an hour to get there. It\u2019s incredible that he has not. Anyone who has actually talked to anyone in the Jungle, or worse, in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/feb/28/msf-to-open-first-humanitarian-standard-refugee-camp-near-dunkirk\">Grande-Synthe, the camp in Dunkirk</a>, would smell the desperation. Every night, these people risk getting their hands ripped up, breaking their limbs and getting teargassed trying to get over the fences because they feel that they have no life anyway. They will get around a wall.</p> <p>So this wall is a symbolic gesture to be built with taxpayers\u2019 money. That money could surely be used to fund centres for the processing of asylum claims. But something unforgivable is happening when we cannot even let in the unaccompanied children from the camps. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/sep/05/disgrace-to-europe-former-child-refugee-lord-dubs-calais-camp\">Stella Creasy, MP for Walthamstow, went over with Alf Dubs to try and do something about this.</a> Those kids, with their strange \u201cprotectors\u201d lurking behind them, haunt me. These are traumatised children, left to rot and be exploited. The volunteers do the best they can, but the situation is at breaking point.</p> <p>Nevertheless, to hear the stories of those who have been helped, is to be jolted out of political ennui. Lives can be rebuilt.</p> <p>A wall is sign of a failure of humanity. In 1964, the artist Joseph Beuys satirised the Berlin wall, suggesting it be raised by 5cm to have better proportions. He made his point and we know what happened to that wall. It is good to be reminded that there are those who build walls but there are those who will build ladders over them. That is called hope.</p>",
  "<p>Women are choosing to freeze their eggs to gain time to find the right partner rather than to pursue their careers, new research suggests.</p> <p>Based on interviews with 31 heterosexual women who had frozen their eggs for non-medical reasons, researchers discovered that the greatest motivation was because the women said they had not found the right man to father their child.</p> <p>\u201cWomen weren\u2019t engaging with technology for their career, they didn\u2019t necessarily seek to delay, [or] put off motherhood, but it was very much more about they wanted to pursue motherhood at the right time, in the right way, with this right partner,\u201d said lead researcher Kylie Baldwin, of the Reproduction Research group at the UK\u2019s De Montfort University.</p> <p> \u201cWomen\u2019s use of this technology is often driven by their relationships with men,\u201d said Baldwin. \u201cInstead of it being focused on egg freezing being a women\u2019s concern, I think it needs to be broadened - I think men need to be brought into the picture more and there needs to be a more well-rounded understanding about why women engage with this technology.\u201d</p> <p>Emily Jackson, professor of law at the London School of Economics and a specialist in reproductive issues, said that despite coming from a small sample of women the findings were consistent with reports from the limited number of other studies available.</p> <p>\u201c[The findings don\u2019t] mean [egg freezing] is not entirely unrelated to work, in the sense that the reason why one might find oneself 38 and single might have something to do with what career conditions were like in one\u2019s 20s,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Egg freezing technology has taken off in the past five years or so, with increasing availability of a new approach, called vitrification, that has boosted success rates of conception. </p> <p>Tim Child, the medical director of the Oxford Fertility Unit, said that the findings chimed with his experience. \u201cThe majority of egg freezing requests are because someone wants to preserve their fertility so they feel as though if it is a few years before they meet the person they want to have a child with, and perhaps their fertility has declined to an extent where that might be more difficult to happen, at least they have got some fertility frozen in time,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Child also says that the sample size does not undermine the results. \u201cYou can base such studies on quite small numbers if the studies are conducted to a high standard.\u201d </p> <p>While the proportion of women freezing their eggs is still low, numbers are growing. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/mar/23/number-british-women-freezing-their-eggs-soars-ivf-hfea\">According to</a> the UK\u2019s Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (HFEA), 816 British women underwent treatment to freeze their eggs in 2014, compared to 652 women in 2013. The approximate rate of live births using frozen eggs, based on those thawed in 2013, was 14%. Although, the report notes, \u201cThe success rate is affected by the age of the woman at the time her eggs were frozen and was considerably lower for women in the older age group.\u201d</p> <p>While the HFEA does not record detailed information on why the women chose to freeze their eggs, or the proportion who did so for medical reasons, in 2014 54.1% of those aged over 38 cited having no male partner as a reason, compared to 36.4% of those under the age of 38.</p> <p>To delve into the issue, Baldwin interviewed women from the UK, US and Norway, recruited from advertisements, who said they had undergone egg freezing for non-medical reasons. Aged between 32 and 44 years old, all had been educated to degree level, with almost 40% having a postgraduate degree - a demographic typical of women who undertake such treatment, says Baldwin.</p> <p>Baldwin says her results, which were presented at the British Science Festival on Wednesday, reveal that the primary reason why the women had opted to freeze their eggs was because they had yet to meet Mr Right. </p> <p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t just about finding the right man, it was about finding the right potential father for their child,\u201d she said. \u201cThey very much wanted to parent with their male partner who was committed to parenthood, who was going to perform that role of the hands-on father and would share the role of upbringing, the pleasures and pains of upbringing, equally.\u201d</p> <p>Other reasons, such as job instability or housing-related issues were also mentioned, says Baldwin, with 20% reporting an underlying health condition that contributed to their choice. </p> <p>While several companies, including Apple and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/oct/15/apple-facebook-offer-freeze-eggs-female-employees\">Facebook</a>, offer egg freezing for female employees, Baldwin says she is not convinced by the approach. \u201cSome of that use of egg freezing technology is often trying to solve the problem of older motherhood by not addressing the root cause, and the cause in many cases is this lack of a partner, lack of job security, not the desire to climb the career ladder,\u201d she said. </p> <p>With 37 as the average age of participants, the research reveals that women are leaving it until later in life to freeze their eggs, despite the decline in egg quality with age, says Baldwin. \u201cWomen need to be engaging with this technology for it to be the most effective before the age of 35, or perhaps even earlier,\u201d she said.</p> <p>But as Jackson points out, there are other considerations. Women in their early thirties still have a good chance of a natural pregnancy, she says, meaning that freezing eggs in their twenties could be an unnecessary invasive and expensive procedure. What\u2019s more, in the absence of special circumstances, current legislation only allows eggs to be frozen for a maximum of 10 years. \u201cThe 10 year time limit means that in a sense it is not sensible to freeze them early, even thought that might be clinically sensible, because they won\u2019t be available to you [later],\u201d she said. </p> <p>Baldwin also warns that the idea of egg freezing should not be presented to women as a quick fix. Cheryl Fitzgerald, Consultant in Reproductive Medicine at Old St Mary\u2019s Hospital, Manchester, agrees. \u201cI think seeing egg freezing as an option when it is things like you haven\u2019t got your house or your haven\u2019t got your job sorted is a really, really bad message because the majority of those women will then not end up with a baby,\u201d she said. <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>\u201cEgg freezing is obviously great for those women who have no other option, but I think it shouldn\u2019t be something that women resort to at an early stage. I think society needs to change and facilitate women to have their babies when they are younger.\u201d </p> <p>While Fitzgerald stresses that it is up to individuals to decide whether or not to freeze their eggs, she warns against the idea of viewing the technology as a simple solution.</p> <p>\u201cI think it is quite dangerous to start suggesting that, by medicalising a social problem, we can cure it,\u201d she said. \u201cIf you\u2019ve not met your partner, you\u2019ve not met your partner, but I think it is a really bad message to give out that actually now we can get round this by egg freezing, because the majority of those women will still not have a baby.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>It has been a bad few months for Islamic State (Isis). For the first time since the terror group laid claim to much of Iraq and Syria, it no longer has a direct path to Europe. Black flags are no longer flying over towns and villages near the Turkish border and the militants of the so-called caliphate are on the run. If the decay continues, Isis will soon lose much of its remaining foothold in Syria. Its last bastion will be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/dec/09/life-under-isis-raqqa-mosul-giant-prison-syria-iraq\">Raqqa</a> and the north-eastern deserts, where it all began for the group\u2019s latest incarnation in April 2013, and from where much of its subsequent rampage was plotted.</p> <p>Since mid-July, Isis has been methodically pushed from towns and villages it controlled near the Turkish frontier by the most concerted ground advance of the past two years. The jihadist group now looks to be far less of a threat to the regional order than when its leader, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/abu-bakr-al-baghdadi\">Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi</a>, proclaimed his rule over a swath of eastern Syria and western Iraq in mid-2014.</p> <p>But little about what comes next is clear. The group\u2019s loss of territory has shifted geopolitical ground in ways that could not easily have been predicted. And, in the eyes of many European governments, its danger has metastasised into a global threat that a loss of land won\u2019t mitigate.

It regularly moved men between the two points, using Turkey, not far north, as a supply line for fighters, money and food.

Isis leaders lorded over their gateways such as Manbij and Jarabulus, along the Turkish frontier.

Schools that had been shuttered were soon being swept out and reopened. People started to smoke again. Men cut off their beards.

It spread after Isis realised it was going to lose a significant part of strategic territory. Most of the people, whether pro-Isis or not, withdrew from the city towards Maskanah and al-Tabqa and then to Raqqa.\u201d</p> <p>These areas amount to the last redoubt of Isis in Syria and will be the targets of a push later this year. Who gets to do the fighting is, as yet, unclear. The link to the Iraqi strongholds of al-Bukamal, Ba\u2019ej, Tal Afar and Mosul remains viable for now, but in Iraq, as in Syria, the self-styled caliphate is rapidly contracting.</p> <p>In Iraq, an assault on Mosul, which has previously been deemed too difficult, is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/14/kurdish-peshmerga-forces-fresh-push-recapture-mosul-isis-iraq\">now being seen as a reality</a> for early next year. Iraqi forces that fled as the jihadists advanced have been reconfigured and galvanised. \u201cConfidence has emerged from battlefield gains,\u201d says a Baghdad-based US diplomat. \u201cAnd while the Iraqis are feeling better about themselves, Isis is feeling worse.

Control of territory, so vital in the heady early days, is no longer as important to Baghdadi and his senior leaders as controlling populations beyond the caliphate\u2019s fast-shrinking boundaries. \u201cThey have highly intelligent leaders calling the shots, being prepared to sacrifice thousands of lessers who are far less disciplined about how they get around and communicate,\u201d says one western diplomat.</p> <p>Another Isis observer, a security official, says: \u201cIt\u2019s very clear that they have sent people to Europe. We know that they expect some to be caught and they accept that. They have others on the way, or already in place.\u201d</p> <p>The Paris and Brussels plotters returned to Europe after being trained between al-Bab and Raqqa by an Isis cell that had been tasked with causing chaos in the west.

And while security officials in Europe believe that much of Isis\u2019s original foreign fighter corps has been killed \u2013 they were seen as dispensable by their leaders \u2013 several hundred have returned to Europe, where they are awaiting instructions from inside Syria and Iraq.</p> <p>\u201cThat, in a sense, is the reason why it doesn\u2019t really matter if they lose this land right now,\u201d says the western diplomat. \u201cThey are an even more potent threat than they were a year ago.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a6873218747cc60e0e4476e45a1f685f92c0febc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a6873218747cc60e0e4476e45a1f685f92c0febc/0_137_4096_2458/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Armed police in Paris during terrorist attack\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Could the west be a renewed target after a refocus on terrorist atrocities by Isis?</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Malte Christians/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The calculation by Isis leaders is that acolytes, fired by some sense of divine purpose, will launch their own attacks, without direct instruction or organisation. Such strikes are increasingly valuable, and damaging to the caliphate\u2019s foes. They are relatively easy to commit, and very difficult to detect.</p> <p>Though fast losing ground, and with morale low in many of their embattled communities, Isis leaders continue to believe that the organisation which first rose out of the US invasion of Iraq in 2003 derives considerable potency from Sunni Muslim resentment. The Isis narrative is that Sunnis, the majority Islamic sect, have been stripped of power and influence by western powers who have handed the reins to the minority Shias. They anchor their very contemporary political gripes in an ancient creed, which says that much of this was preordained.</p> <p>An essential sell for Isis leaders to would-be jihadists such as Davis, Kotey and Emwazi is that their generation has the privilege to not only correct recent indignities, but to restore the lost glories of Islam. The withering caliphate is becoming the latest <em>casus belli</em> \u2013 a divine mission to replace the \u201cfalsehood\u201d of the nation state with Islamic rule being stripped away by yet more western aggression.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"df6302a61ba2160e936615f06a6842dce0bfca3e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/df6302a61ba2160e936615f06a6842dce0bfca3e/0_10_2000_1200/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Turkish workers with some of the modular blocks that will form the wall along the Syrian border\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Turkish workers with some of the modular blocks that will form the wall along the Syrian border.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>How that aggression takes shape in the coming months will be pivotal to the direction of the war against the jihadists \u2013 and the overall course of the Syrian war.

Accused of being too slow to react to the threat from Isis, whose ranks were reinforced largely through the then-porous Turkish border, Ankara is now <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jul/23/turkey-syria-border-reinforced-suruc-suicide-attack\">building a wall</a> along much of it.</p> <p>In Iraq, Isis now has just as much trouble securing supply lines outside its strongholds. The border with Syria remains a free-for-all, but offers little to increasingly desperate fighters seeking refuge or escape. The desert frontiers of Saudi Arabia and Jordan are better policed and even more foreboding.</p> <p>\u201cMorale is desperate,\u201d one Isis official tells the Guardian. \u201cEven in Raqqa.

  "<p>Andrew Strauss, the director of England cricket, has conceded he cannot force players to go to Bangladesh but warned that missing the tour would mean risking losing their place in the team in the future.</p> <p>The trip, which features three one-day internationals and two Tests, begins at the end of this month, was given the all-clear by the England and Wales Cricket Board\u2019s security director, Reg Dickason, a fortnight ago but there remains the possibility that individuals, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/sep/06/eoin-morgan-bangladesh-chris-jordan-england-t20-pakistan\" title=\"\">including the limited-overs captain, Eoin Morgan</a>, may opt out.</p> <p>Strauss will meet the players at the ECB\u2019s national academy in Loughborough on Friday and Saturday for a series of one-on-one contract appraisals when he will also look to establish who will be making themselves available for selection before the squad announcement on 16 September.</p> <p>Morgan is not alone in considering whether Bangladesh, where <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/01/dhaka-bangladesh-restaurant-attack-hostages\" title=\"\">20 hostages were killed during a terrorist attack</a> in the capital, Dhaka, on 1 July, is safe to tour, with the opener Alex Hales also also understood to be considering withdrawal. Strauss, who has full faith in Dickason\u2019s report, is hopeful of a full-strength squad.</p> <p>He said: \u201cWe feel it\u2019s safe to go and I genuinely believe that and that is why I\u2019m encouraging every player to use that incredibly detailed and experienced viewpoint from Reg to make a judgment.</p> <p>\u201cI think the reason why it\u2019s a good thing for players to follow the security advice is things remain very black and white, which is: if Reg says it\u2019s safe to go somewhere, it\u2019s safe; and if it isn\u2019t, it isn\u2019t. I think if you\u2019re making your own opinions, based on your own perceptions, then you\u2019re in a bit more of a grey area there.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m urging the players to take Reg\u2019s advice, and follow that advice, and I\u2019m still hopeful players will do that. I can\u2019t force anyone up the steps to the plane and say: \u2018You have to go to Bangladesh.\u2019 People have their own decisions to make. I think, at its most simple level, the big consequence for not going is you are giving someone else an opportunity to step into your shoes and stake a claim for themselves.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s just the same as if someone gets injured; you are out of possession of that spot in the team for a certain period of time and, if someone does really well, then you can\u2019t give any guarantees. But that\u2019s a choice people have to make themselves. Everyone has a different attitude to risk and different thoughts about what their priorities in life are.\u201d</p> <p>The Test captain, Alastair Cook, has, along with a number of players, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/29/alastair-cook-confirms-place-england-tour-bangladesh-security\" title=\"\">already committed to the tour</a> but, were Morgan to withdraw, Strauss would temporarily lose the player he backed to continue as one-day captain after the disastrous 2015 World Cup and whose leadership has overseen a significant upturn in fortunes.</p> <p>Strauss said: \u201cWould I like both our captains to be on that tour? Absolutely. The captain has certain roles and responsibilities that are greater than just looking after themselves. He has a duty to the team \u2013 but they\u2019re still human beings. They have their own thoughts, concerns, issues and views on life and we\u2019ve got to understand that.\u201d</p> <p>Of concern to certain England players, in addition to the July attack, are the reasons behind Australia\u2019s postponement of their tour last October. Officially it was because of a \u201ccredible risk to Australians in Bangladesh\u201d in general. However, recent reports that the team itself was a potential target \u2013 something Cricket Australia has played down but not publicly denied \u2013 have raised anxiety levels.</p> <p>Strauss, who said missing the tour would not necessarily rule a player out of the pre-Christmas trip to India, said: \u201cReg spoke to the players about that issue in the initial meeting and the process Australia went through. He certainly threw that into the mix when he was in Bangladesh and forming his own opinions on whether the risk was mitigated to an acceptable level. We all know the decision he made on that.\u201d</p> <p>The International Cricket Council has shelved plans for the creation of a two-division Test championship following opposition from Zimbabwe, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and, most significantly, India. The proposed two-year league structure, which would have featured promotion and relegation, was considered by the Board of Control for Cricket in India to be potentially damaging for smaller nations outside the top tier.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2016/sep/07/england-v-pakistan-t20-international-live\">England v Pakistan: T20 international \u2013\u00a0live!</a> </p> </aside>",

It was a deliberate act but an act of folly. Now we have the opportunity to right it,\u201d he said.</p> <p>British waters make up a vast swath of European fishing territory outside the 12-mile exclusion zone along the coast of each member state. One argument for Brexit was that it would give the fishing sector sole control of the waters. </p> <p>However, neither fishing federation is seeking this, as fish \u2013 particularly mackerel, herring and cod \u2013 are highly mobile.

(Schwimmer and Travolta are also nominated for Emmys.)

This historical resonance is a boon for the show, but also leaves its mark on Brown, who is originally from Missouri. \u201cWhen <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/mar/04/darren-wilson-federal-criminal-charges-michael-brown-shooting\">the officer who killed Mike Brown wasn\u2019t indicted</a>, I just broke into tears,\u201d he says.

Still, Brown has opinions, and he wants to share them.</p> <p>Musing on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2016/jun/27/justin-timberlake-jesse-williams-bet-speech-response-tweet\">Jesse Williams\u2019s \u201cincredibly eloquent\u201d speech at the BET awards</a>, in which the Grey\u2019s Anatomy actor linked the oppression of African Americans down the centuries to the white plundering of black culture today, Brown tries to articulate his view of his own responsibilities. \u201cImmediately before that, with <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jun/05/the-guardian-view-on-muhammad-ali-a-life-of-bravery\">the loss of Muhammad Ali</a>, it sort of dawned on me that what you do and who you are are not the same thing, and you should not necessarily be placed in a box\u201d \u2013 at least professionally speaking. \u201cMuhammad Ali was the greatest of all time,\u201d he continues. \u201cBut what made him even greater was what he did outside the ring.\u201d It\u2019s in that light that he feels compelled to speak out when he\u2019s asked about current events, especially in the ways they connect to the Simpson trial.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/feb/01/oj-simpson-american-crime-story-fx-espn-tv-shows\">OJ Simpson and the unshakable demons that continue to haunt America</a> </p> </aside>  <p>For example: Brown describes Johnnie Cochran\u2019s tactics during the trial as the \u201cright message with the wrong messenger\u201d. (Simpson took pains to avoid being depicted as a black man and never used his wealth in support of black causes until his race helped him get off for murder.) Brown also takes pains to separate the spectacle of the OJ trial \u2013 which adds a comedic element to The People v OJ \u2013 from the superficially similar spectacle of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/14/videos-police-violence-history\">the seemingly endless body camera videos depicting police killings</a>. \u201cThey\u2019re related in that they\u2019re all for public consumption, but they\u2019re different in terms of the way people were infatuated with the trial.\u201d</p> <p>Still, the spectacle of the trial continues, not least in the renewed public appearances of <a href=\"http://www.vulture.com/2016/03/mark-fuhrman-what-happened-after-oj-simpson-trial.html\">Mark Fuhrman</a>, the Los Angeles police officer whose history of racist remarks became a key argument for the defense in the trial. Brown is only familiar with his talking-head moments in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/jan/24/oj-made-in-america-espn-review\">Made in America</a>, the ESPN documentary about Simpson. \u201cI haven\u2019t seen him in anything else.

Brown plays the defendant, a black man accused of raping a white woman.</p> <p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/reghud?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\">Reginald Hudlin</a>, former president of entertainment at BET and director of Marshall, also wrote Marvel\u2019s Black Panther comic from 2005 to 2008. Brown recalls reading: \u201c\u2018Man, they\u2019re never gonna make a movie about the Black Panther.\u2019 And here we are, I just finished making a movie with the Black Panther ... If I could be a superhero, I\u2019d look forward to that, sincerely.\u201d</p> <p>That\u2019s certainly a plausible outcome, given Brown\u2019s newfound success and Emmy nomination. The hype around The People v OJ has led to some strange offers, including a \u201csort of <a href=\"http://kirkcameron.com/\">Kirk Cameron</a> Christian film\u201d that Brown rejected because it \u201cdidn\u2019t really jive with the way I see God\u201d. Moving gingerly into discussing theology, Brown outlines his differences with the film\u2019s producers: \u201cI do not believe that any particular religion has any monopoly on salvation.\u201d I ask whether that was true of the producers of the movie, and he laughs. \u201cNah.\u201d</p> <p>Brown takes his religious life seriously, even when it brings him into conflict with his own mother. \u201cMy mom, who is a very strong Christian woman, will often ask me how some of the characters I play glorify God,\u201d he says. \u201cHer meaning is that she feels as if every character should be a good Christian character, which is not necessarily my interpretation.\u201d For starters, it would make consistently engaging drama very difficult.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cb6b03677d01213dfd7396b40600176d56888d9f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cb6b03677d01213dfd7396b40600176d56888d9f/0_0_3000_2119/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Susan Kelechi Watson as Beth and Brown as Randall in This is Us.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"706\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Susan Kelechi Watson as Beth and Brown as Randall in This is Us.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ron Batzdorff/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But getting to please his mom is part of why Brown is excited for his forthcoming role on <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.nbc.com/this-is-us?CID=Search%7CThis-is-us&amp;nbc=1\">This is Us</a>, the highly anticipated NBC series from <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/sep/22/crazy-stupid-love-film-review\">Crazy Stupid Love </a>writer Dan Fogelman. His mother, Brown says, is \u201cnot a TV-MA kind of gal ... This is Us is definitely more of her wheelhouse\u201d. Brown plays Randall, a successful businessman who reconnects with his absent biological father. \u201cRandall is probably much more sure of himself,\u201d he says, in contrast to Darden. \u201cHe\u2019s wealthy. I ain\u2019t wealthy.\u201d</p> <p>Brown hasn\u2019t exactly gone for the big bucks in his career. His first theater job was a Philip Glass opera adaptation of Kafka\u2019s short story <a href=\"http://philipglass.com/compositions/in_the_penal_colony/\">In the Penal Colony</a> in which he didn\u2019t sing or speak, just moved. He recounts living in Harlem in a fourth-floor walk-up, riding the bus across 125th Street for the air conditioning, and sleeping naked in a room so hot \u201cthere\u2019d be a sweat imprint of my body on top of the bed\u201d. \u201cAnd I couldn\u2019t have been happier. Because my overhead, to what I had coming in \u2013 the disparity was so great, I was like, \u2018I\u2019m pocketing $270 a week, son, are you kidding me? I\u2019m killing the game!\u2019 And that was the time I felt most financially secure, even though I\u2019ve made infinitely more money since then.\u201d</p> <p>So how will he use his newfound fame? Brown wants to form a \u201crepertory troupe\u201d of actors who could work on projects together. Besides Paulson (his first and most important selection), he lists The Knick\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2015/oct/13/the-knick-andre-holland-interview\">Andre Holland</a>; <a href=\"https://www.thrillist.com/entertainment/nation/atlanta-paper-boi-actor-brian-tyree-henry\">Brian Tyree Henry</a>, who plays rapper Paper Boi in Donald Glover\u2019s new series <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/sep/06/better-things-atlanta-fx-comedy-donald-glover-pamela-adlon\">Atlanta</a>; Vice Principals\u2019 <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2016/08/vice-principals-kimberly-hebert-gregory\">Kimberly Hebert Gregory</a>; and Marshall co-stars Boseman and Gad. (\u201cHashtag ChadGad.\u201d)</p> <p>Though it now seems like a fait accompli that Brown would be nominated for an Emmy, the past few months for him have been a process of slowly accepting the possibility that not only might he be nominated, he might well win. He recoils slightly when asked about the moment he first realized he could be nominated, when the crew responded enthusiastically to a screening of the pilot (that Brown and Paulson both skipped) and favorably compared The People v OJ to Brown\u2019s favorite show, <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/series/fargo-episode-recaps\">Fargo</a>. \u201cThis year, as the nominations were coming, people were telling me, \u2018Yo man, you gon\u2019 got nominated, you gon\u2019 win,\u2019 and I was like, \u2018Thank you, thank you, I appreciate that.\u2019 You never know \u2019til you know.\u201d</p> <p>Has he allowed himself to consider the possibility that he might win? \u201cI allow myself to think about it.\u201d He\u2019s even started thinking about his speech. \u201cI remember before, when I watched the Emmys or the Oscars and people had speeches, I was like, \u2018They knew they was gon\u2019 win.\u2019 But no. You write a speech so that you don\u2019t look like a jackass when you get up there and forget your wife\u2019s name or anything else \u2013 just in case.\u201d How did it turn out? \u201cTalk to me September 19 and I\u2019ll tell you how it went.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>In 2007, a historical footnote about France\u2019s relentless military leader Napoleon Bonaparte gained wide attention: he was a failed novelist. The French publishing house Fayard had released the full version of Napoleon\u2019s novella, <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Clisson-Eug%C3%A9nie-Litt%C3%A9rature-Fran%C3%A7aise-French-ebook/dp/B00TAUOJUI/ref=sr_1_2?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1473184263&amp;sr=1-2&amp;keywords=clisson+et+eug%C3%A9nie#nav-subnav\">Clisson et Eug\u00e9nie</a>, culled from six far-flung, ink-blotted manuscript fragments. That same year, the rediscovery and subsequent sale in France of one of its pages for \u20ac24,000 ($27,000) stimulated yet more interest in the emperor\u2019s literary prose.</p> <p>Now, a substantial section of the manuscript is headed to auction on 21 September at <a href=\"http://www.bonhams.com/auctions/23431/lot/1151/\">Bonhams</a> in New York, where the auction house expects it will reach as much as $250,000. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/jun/03/thomas-keneally-what-really-happened-during-napoleons-exile\">Thomas Keneally: what really happened during Napoleon's exile</a> </p> </aside>  <p>While Napoleon manuscripts and memorabilia are relatively common at auction and can realize staggering sums \u2013 such as <a href=\"http://www.irishtimes.com/news/world/europe/napoleon-s-hat-sold-to-south-korean-bidder-for-1-9m-1.2003063\">\u20ac1.9m for one of his beaver fur bicorne hats in 2014</a> \u2013 collectors typically vie for something emblematic of the man, said Christina Geiger, director of fine books and manuscripts at Bonhams. Which makes this scrap of his creative writing something of an outlier. \u201cNormally, that maybe detracts from the value, but in this case, his character is so fascinating \u2026 It just gets at those psychological contradictions in a way that his military planning documents or something like that wouldn\u2019t as much.\u201d</p> <p>Clisson et Eug\u00e9nie is unabashedly autobiographical. Penned in the autumn of 1795, while Napoleon was still rising in the ranks of the French army, the novel centers around an officer named Clisson, \u201ca man of fervent imagination, with his blazing heart, his uncompromising intellect and his cool head\u201d. The war-weary Clisson decides to quit his position and enjoy the spa baths of central France. There he meets two young women, Am\u00e9lie and Eug\u00e9nie, and falls desperately (and tragically) in love with Eug\u00e9nie. While tender, this romance is also quite tame. The closest the author comes to sex may be: \u201cTheir hearts fused \u2026 the most exquisite voluptuousness flooded the hearts of the two enraptured lovers.\u201d</p> <p>The novella only runs about 22<strong> </strong>scribbled pages, so the plot swiftly progresses from love to marriage to melancholy. </p> <p>Like his protagonist, Napoleon had just turned 26; his great conquests were still ahead of him. And, like his protagonist, Napoleon had also favored a Eug\u00e9nie: Bernardine Eug\u00e9nie D\u00e9sir\u00e9e Clary, to be exact. She was the sister-in-law of Napoleon\u2019s brother Joseph. The two met in the summer of 1794 and carried on a warm epistolary relationship. Many believe they were engaged, but her family blocked the union and the breakup was finalized by September 1795. Napoleon married Jos\u00e9phine de Beauharnais the following March.</p> <p>By then, his sentimental manuscript was presumably tucked away somewhere, safe from prying eyes while he built an empire. Napoleon still had the manuscript when he died in exile in 1821. After that, the unbound pages were scattered, according to Peter Hicks and \u00c9milie Barthet, in an interpretive note published with their <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Clisson-andEug%C3%A9nie-Napoleon-Bonaparte-ebook/dp/B0078XG45M/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1473184263&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=clisson+et+eug%C3%A9nie#nav-subnav\">2009 English translation</a> of the novel.</p> <p>Hicks and Barthet methodically reconstructed Clisson et Eug\u00e9nie from the six known fragments, all in various states of drafting and revision, for the 2007 French publication. The \u201cmost important\u201d and lengthiest piece, referred to as the Kornik manuscript, fills 13 pages and resides at the <a href=\"http://www.bkpan.poznan.pl/english/library/\">Kornik Library of the Polish Academy of Sciences</a>. It was previously published in 1929 and 1955.</p> <p>The next-longest section is the one heading to auction later this month, the content of which is \u201cfairly crucial\u201d, said Geiger. \u201cIt\u2019s four pages and they go from meeting to falling in love to being married for seven years.\u201d According to Geiger, the manuscript arrived in the United States in 1957, after having changed hands among continental booksellers in the early 20th century. It has most recently been in the collection of David Karpeles, the California collector who founded 14 <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.rain.org/~karpeles/\">manuscript libraries</a> around the United States, stocked them with unique historic documents such as a draft of the bill of rights and Mendelssohn\u2019s manuscript of his Wedding March, and opened them to the public for exhibitions and school programs.</p> <p>Then there are four minor fragments, each consisting of a page or two. Two of them are held by the State Historical Museum in Moscow, and two are privately owned.</p> <p>\u201cNapoleon is not often thought of these days as a writer. And if he is, it\u2019s certainly not as an author of fiction,\u201d Hicks told the Guardian. \u201cThat being said, some commentators before 1900 described him as the greatest French writer of the 19th century, thinking most notably about his correspondence.\u201d Indeed, his letters number about 42,000, and the <a href=\"http://en.fondationnapoleon.org/\">Foundation Napoleon</a>, where Hicks is manager of international affairs, is currently publishing the final three volumes of a 15-volume set of Napoleon\u2019s complete correspondence.</p> <p>\u201cWhen you become the ruler of a good part of the known world \u2013 as a result of a military and political acumen that astounded contemporaries \u2013 literary ability ends up being just an \u2018also ran\u2019 accomplishment,\u201d Hicks said.</p>",
  "<p>Whatever people think of Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s supporters, it\u2019s probably fair to say there is an assumption that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jun/27/young-put-jeremy-corbyn-in-now-should-push-him-out\" title=\"\">they are young</a>.

Corbyn has a 61% approval rating among 18- to 24-year-olds, 64% among 25- to 39-year-olds and 63% among 40- to 59-year-olds. Meanwhile, of those who have now joined the Labour campaign group Momentum, only a third of those disclosing their age are millennials. And the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/ng-interactive/2016/jan/13/the-corbyn-effect-thousands-have-flocked-to-the-labour-party-since-may-but-who-are-they\" title=\"\">Guardian\u2019s own research</a>, speaking with 100 Labour officials across Britain in January, showed that those signing up to the party in their thousands were in fact a mix of young and old, first-time members and returnees.</p> <p>So it seems white-haired democratic socialists also attract supporters from Generation X, those aged 35-50: me, that is. Actor Mark Ruffalo also falls into that demographic. Earlier this year, he interviewed \u201cBernie from Brooklyn\u201d, exploring how the politician\u2019s upbringing in this New York borough shaped his policies. One part of this video interview jumps out: \u201cYou know what you make me feel?\u201d the 48-year-old Ruffalo asks Sanders. \u201cThat all of my ideals as a young person can actually grow up with me.\u201d</p> <p>This, in so many ways, encapsulates the appeal of older leftwing politicians to the over-35s. But we, just like the millennials, are dismissed as naive and unrealistic, and derided by political pundits who insist socialism is dead and that only swing-voter-friendly, centrist politics can win elections, <a href=\"http://www.economist.com/news/briefing/21695887-centre-left-sharp-decline-across-europe-rose-thou-art-sick\" title=\"\">even while the centre-left as a political force has collapsed across western Europe, from Spain to Greece to the Netherlands</a>.</p> <p>Overusing words such as sensible and pragmatic, the commentariat insists that only a sort of middle England-friendly, marginal seat-focused compromise can walk into No 10. But Generation X felt the ravaging effects of such centrist compromises during New Labour\u2019s 13 years in office, when stealth-privatisation, via PFI, in the NHS and schools, the embrace of a deregulated free market, the failure to support the manufacturing sector and the perpetuation of Tory-style welfare reforms all sucked the life out of public services, while draining the wealth out of the economy.</p> <p>For my generation, the politics proposed by Corbyn are a long-awaited challenge to the assumption of third-way pragmatism as the natural order of things (even as this natural order leads to financial catastrophe and rampant inequality). Corbyn\u2019s approach also punctures the dominance of marketing and spin \u2013 over policies and substance \u2013 that seem to go hand in hand with these supposedly \u201cpragmatic\u201d politics.</p> <p>Meanwhile, older socialist politicians are living rebuttals to the idea that we \u201cgrow out of\u201d leftwing politics. In reality, there is no truth to this: researchers have been unable to show conclusively that we become more conservative as we age. One workable theory is that older, more conservative cohorts polled on political views today came of age during a period of political conservatism: they are simply holding on to a position, not shifting it.</p> <p>If the patronising complaint hurled at millennials is that they are too young to remember the bad days of the old left, my generation does remember. First, we remember that \u201cleft\u201d is not synonymous with \u201cbad\u201d and that left politics do have popular support (just check the figures in support of renationalisation of utilities, for example, or fairer taxation). Meanwhile, we also recall Corbyn speaking out against apartheid at a time when the current party of government was <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/dec/06/conservative-party-uncomfortable-nelson-mandela\" title=\"\">calling Nelson Mandela a terrorist</a> and doing business with an internationally boycotted South Africa. Like Sanders, Corbyn was opposed to the Iraq war at the time, foreseeing its devastating consequences for the Iraqi people. And it is striking how often this war comes up when speaking with Corbyn supporters. This isn\u2019t purely about remembering the invasion. It\u2019s about wanting politicians to take a different, more credible approach across the Middle East. In this context, the significance of Corbyn\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/jul/06/david-cameron-uk-must-never-repeat-iraq-war-mistakes\" title=\"\">apology for the war</a> on publication of the Chilcot report was vastly overlooked by the British media.</p> <p>It is easy to accuse Corbyn of being stuck in the past, but such throwaway putdowns miss the merits of having consistently held values that \u201cgrow up with you\u201d. At a time when trust in Westminster is so eroded, a politician who has repeatedly, Google-verifiably kept to the same principles is going to appeal across generations.</p>",
  "<p><a href=\"https://home.cern/\">CERN </a>is home to some of the largest and most complex scientific equipment on the planet. Yet back in March, scientists gathered there for a <a href=\"http://www.makery.info/en/2016/03/14/gosh-reunit-le-mouvement-open-science-hardware-au-cern/\">conference about DIY laboratory tools</a>. Scientists in poorly funded labs, particularly in the global south, have <a href=\"https://www.academia.edu/5082651/The_making_of_an_indigenous_Scanning_Tunneling_Microscope_and_Technological_Jugaad_as_a_culture_of_innovation_in_India\">used DIY tools for many years</a>. But well-resourced institutes are increasingly interested in the collaborative possibilities of open labware. Citizen scientists are also using it to build instruments for tasks like <a href=\"https://publiclab.org/\">environmental monitoring</a>, which can then be used to support community demands for justice from polluters.</p> <p>It is not only scientists \u2013 citizen or professional \u2013 who are going DIY. An open hardware movement of hobbyists, activists, geeks, designers, engineers, students and social entrepreneurs is creating ingenious versions of all sorts of technologies, and freely sharing the know-how through social media. Open hardware is also encroaching upon centres of manufacturing. In August, for instance, the <a href=\"http://fab12.fabevent.org/\">global gathering of FabLabs met in Shenzhen</a> (already <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/political-science/2014/apr/24/making-in-china-maker-faire-shenzhen-global-politics-maker-movement\">host</a> to Maker Faires) to review how their network can help to decentralise design and manufacture.</p> <p>The free software movement is cited as both an inspiration and a model for open hardware. Free software practices have transformed our culture by making it easier for people to become involved in producing things from magazines to music, movies to games, communities to services. With advances in digital fabrication making it easier to manipulate materials, some now anticipate an analogous opening up of manufacturing to mass participation.</p> <p>One online community has been developing <a href=\"http://www.diybookscanner.org/\">DIY book scanners</a>. These enable you to build a machine for automatically photographing book pages; and then download free software to process the images into a file. Having digitized your books, you might go further by sharing the files online (taking care to post anonymously to a site relaxed about copyright law).</p> <p>The list of open hardware available to people continues to grow. The <a href=\"http://opensourceecology.org\">Open Source Ecology</a> group is even developing a Global Village Construction Kit of tools for self-sufficiency, from machine tools to housing to tractors and beyond. A \u2018global commons\u2019 of accessible tools is emerging.</p> <p>Open hardware can be serious business too. Take <a href=\"http://reprap.org\">RepRap</a>: a 3D printer community whose open source practices enabled its rapid growth. Its evolution took a controversial turn when members of the Resistor hackerspace in New York decided to commercialize their version of the RepRap, and protected aspects of its design through intellectual property. Their <a href=\"http://www.makerbot.com\">Makerbot</a> business was subsequently bought for $400 million by 3D printer manufacturer Stratosys; a move which provoked fierce <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2014/05/28/makerbot-responds-to-critics-who-claim-it-is-stealing-community-ip/\">criticism</a> from open hardware advocates.</p> <p>Hobbyists have always tinkered with technologies for their own purposes (in early personal computing, for example). And social activists have long advocated the power of giving tools to people. The <a href=\"http://www.wholeearth.com/index.php\">Whole Earth Catalogue</a> was an early proponent of the liberating potential of digital technology. Then there were the dog-eared Appropriate Technology manuals that a generation of aid workers carried into the developing world in the 1970s and 1980s. Other antecedents include Victor Papanek\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.rootsimple.com/2014/02/nomadic-furniture/\">Nomadic Furniture</a> and Walter Segal\u2019s self-build <a href=\"http://www.architecturefoundation.org.uk/programme/2015/walter%E2%80%99s-way-the-anarchist-housing-estate\">housing</a>. We can compare these with their digital heirs at <a href=\"https://www.opendesk.cc\">Open Desk</a> and <a href=\"http://www.wikihouse.cc\">WikiHouse</a>. Open, community-based technology <a href=\"http://peerproduction.net/issues/issue-5-shared-machine-shops/peer-reviewed-articles/technology-networks-for-socially-useful-production/\">workshops</a> are not so new either.</p> <p>So is this just old wine in new bottles? We think not. Open hardware lowers the barriers to participation in rapid prototyping in ways that earlier activists would find astonishing. And with community-workshops popping up in many towns, and online sharing platforms proliferating, the possibilities for doing technology differently are genuinely exciting.</p> <p>Nevertheless, older experiences hold important lessons for the new. Our <a href=\"https://www.routledge.com/Grassroots-Innovation-Movements/Smith-Fressoli-Abrol-Arond-Ely/p/book/9781138901223\">research</a> into grassroots innovation movements, old and new, brings insights that activists today would be wise to consider.</p> <p>The immediacy and connectedness of open hardware does not nullify the need for real skills in technology development. There remains a craft element to even the fleetest of digitally enabled tools. Experienced designers, engineers and machinists know the importance in understanding not just the tools themselves, but also the materials they work with. Practices that respect materials across their whole life cycle become imperative. <a href=\"https://oscedays.org\">Sustainable</a> open hardware shifts the focus to making sufficiently, design for repair and repurposing, upcycling objects, and valuing the craft therein. Just because we can make almost anything, doesn\u2019t mean we should.</p> <p>And the materials involved are not simply physical. They are social too. If open hardware is to be genuinely inclusive, then its practices must actively empower people to become involved. Notionally accessible tools need to become actually available, and people need to feel confident using them. This requires <a href=\"http://steps-centre.org/wp-content/uploads/MC-report_final.pdf\">social skills</a> in community participation, as well as technology skills.</p> <p><a href=\"http://fablabsuk.co.uk/\">FabLabs</a> are fantastic at combining face-to-face developments with online networks. These hybrid spaces contribute important infrastructure for open hardware. But maintaining infrastructure needs investment. Existing institutions, such as schools, museums, local governments, universities, and corporations are helping fund open workshops. </p> <p>These institutional links bring the political dilemmas of open hardware to the surface. Is it really transforming technology development, or simply a refreshing input for business as usual? Education institutions see cool ways to induct people into conventional science, technology and manufacturing jobs. Local governments get excited about the entrepreneurial possibilities. Corporations see a reservoir of design prototypes offered up by the free labour of enthusiasts.</p> <p>It is important to keep sharp open hardware\u2019s more transformational edges, on agendas such as dismantling intellectual property and releasing investment for alternative business models. Only through a mix of craft, politics, and the support of social movements, will open hardware fully realise its potential to democratise technology.</p> <p><em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/smithadrianpaul?lang=en-gb\">Adrian Smith</a> is professor of technology and society at the Science Policy Research Unit (SPRU) and a member of the ESRC STEPS Centre (Social, Technological and Environmental Pathways to Sustainability) at the University of Sussex. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/@mfressoli\">Dr Mariano Fressoli</a> is a researcher at the National Scientific and Technical Research Council (CONICET, Argentina) and STEPS Latin America.

But consternation too, at the Daily Mail and even among some of the English liberal middle classes.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/sep/07/nine-people-charged-black-lives-matter-protest-london-city-airport\">Nine people charged over Black Lives Matter protest at City airport</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cThese people\u201d who had paddled across the docks in Newham, one of the poorest boroughs in London, were supposedly with the group called Black Lives Matter. But \u2013 shock! \u2013 they were all white. And black people, as you know, are not interested in climate change or air pollution anyway. The <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/debate/article-3777065/DAILY-MAIL-COMMENT-MPs-mourn-Mr-Vaz-s-departure.html\" title=\"\">Mail was splenetic</a>, saying claims that air pollution discriminated against minorities were \u201cludicrous\u201d.</p> <p>Well, times have changed. The days when only black people should protest about issues that affect black people \u2013 and when climate and air pollution were separate issues, and people in east London didn\u2019t need to bother about what happens in Africa or the US \u2013 have long gone.</p> <p>It\u2019s time for a catch-up. One of the reasons why the nine paddled over the dock was because City airport, right in the heart of one of the largest cities on Earth, has been allowed to continuously expand. It is a scandal, and would be challenged in nearly every country of the world.</p> <p>Moreover, the number of planes landing at and taking off from the airport has massively grown, the number of passengers has <a href=\"https://www.londoncityairport.com/aboutandcorporate/page/passengerstatistics\" title=\"\">nearly doubled in nine years</a>, and the planes are far bigger now than they were. Flight paths are <a href=\"http://www.airportwatch.org.uk/uk-airports/london-city-airport/london-city-airport-news/\" title=\"\">becoming more concentrated</a> and the result is <a href=\"http://www.neweconomics.org/blog/entry/why-its-time-to-close-london-city-airport\" title=\"\">more noise, more air pollution, more blight and more public anger</a>.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/video/2016/sep/06/black-lives-matter-protesters-lie-in-chains-on-london-city-airport-runway-aerial-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/5xp54\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2695252\"            data-video-name=\"Black Lives Matter protesters lie in chains on London City airport runway \u2013 aerial video\"            data-video-provider=\"guardian.co.uk\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-57ce92e0e4b01f3b278919e4\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/09/06/160906aerialsairport_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/09/06/160906aerialsairport.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/09/06/160906aerialsairport_WebM.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/video/2016/sep/06/black-lives-matter-protesters-lie-in-chains-on-london-city-airport-runway-aerial-video\">Black Lives Matter protesters lie in chains on London City airport runway \u2013 aerial video</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>Yet City airport\u2019s expansion has been shovelled through local and national planning with minimum consultation and without much public debate, even as air pollution in London is known by the government <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/jul/15/nearly-9500-people-die-each-year-in-london-because-of-air-pollution-study\" title=\"\">to be killing 9,500 people a year and breaking the law</a>.</p> <p>But there are other reasons why the nine crossed the pond. East London, with some of the most deprived, blighted and polluted communities in Europe, is targeted by the road-building lobby and Transport for London for not just one more Thames four-lane road bridge or tunnel, <a href=\"https://tfl.gov.uk/corporate/publications-and-reports/new-river-crossings-for-london\" title=\"\">but three</a>.</p> <p>If these are built, Newham and Tower Hamlets boroughs, in the north, and Greenwich and Bexley, south of the river, will each get massive new roads and tens of thousands of extra cars ploughing through them every day. Transport for London claims that the new crossings will bring relief from congestion. The reality, say the experts, is that they will bring extra traffic and pollution.</p> <p>Air pollution in Silvertown, where one tunnel is proposed, is already <a href=\"http://www.newhamrecorder.co.uk/news/environment/air_pollution_expert_brands_silvertown_tunnel_plans_criminal_and_unjust_1_1831084\" title=\"\">more than one-and-a-half times</a> the European legal limit. In parts of Tower Hamlets, where another crossing is planned, it is worse. According to the government, 98 people in Newham alone died from air pollution in 2010.</p> <p>Residents in these boroughs have long been dumped on by governments. They get the sewage works, the concrete works and the pollution, and now they can expect more heart and lung diseases, more pressure on the National health, more costs and more personal heartache. Unsuprisingly, many are pretty furious.</p> <p>Then there\u2019s the climate. As Asad Rehman of Friends of the Earth says, when it comes to climate change, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/mar/31/climate-change-poor-suffer-most-un-report\" title=\"\">those who have done the least to create the climate crisis are the worst affected</a>. Devastating floods, droughts and famine, mainly affecting the lives and livelihoods of millions of poor and black communities in developing countries, is the stark reality of climate change already. This is going to get much worse if rich countries such as the UK don\u2019t do more to cut their emissions faster and deeper, and sign up to the Paris agreement.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Average emissions of business people flying from City are probably way more than the average person living in Newham</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>It\u2019s the same in London. Average emissions of business people flying from City airport are almost certainly way more than those of the average person living in Newham or Tower Hamlet boroughs.</p> <p>Moreover, there is plenty of evidence that black people and ethnic minorities are much more likely to be affected by bad air. Research first <a href=\"http://www.endsreport.com/docs/20090820a.pdf\" title=\"\">by the UK government</a>, and <a href=\"http://www3.imperial.ac.uk/newsandeventspggrp/imperialcollege/newssummary/news_26-1-2015-12-17-52\" title=\"\">recently</a> by Imperial College London and the National Institute for Public Health and the Environment in the Netherlands have shown that the average person identifying as black or black-British African in the UK is exposed to much higher levels of pollutants than the average urban white person.</p> <p>Children, older people, those with asthma and cyclists are all more likely to be affected by poor air quality, as are poorer communities and minority ethnic ones. The study concluded that the most deprived 10% of areas in England are subject to 41% higher concentrations of nitrogen dioxide from transport and industry than the average. The biggest differences in air pollution levels according to socioeconomic status were in London.</p> <p>Agendas and groupings have merged. We know that to reduce climate emissions we need to tackle air pollution as well. It little matters who takes the lead in challenging power or under which banner people choose to act. There is no longer ownership of police atrocities, or pollution or injustice. The only certain things these days in the environment is that racism thrives and that pollution follows the poor.</p>",
  "<p>As the athletes prepare take to the starting line in the Rio Paralympics, they aren\u2019t just facing a physical test but a mental one. <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://fitnessforlife.org/AcuCustom/Sitename/Documents/DocumentItem/01_J3644%20JCSP%205_3_Martin_2011.pdf\">Sports psychologists</a> (pdf) have identified five traits and skills that help Paralympic champions to flourish. But can these be taught? And, if so, could they help our pupils to perform better at school? Here\u2019s what students can learn from the competition:</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/teacher-network/2016/aug/31/great-expectations-how-to-help-your-students-fulfil-their-potential\">Great expectations: how to help your students fulfil their potential</a> </p> </aside>  <h2>Self-regulation</h2> <p>Are Paralympic champions less anxious by nature, or are they better at handling their nerves? Probably a bit of both. Stress and anxiety can hinder concentration, so it takes a lot of self-composure to deliver your best performance when it matters the most.</p> <p>There are lots of strategies for managing emotions, many of which can be adopted by students facing stressful challenges at school. Improving self-talk \u2013 making pupils\u2019 inner monologues more positive \u2013 can be used to boost productivity, and changing their mindsets to see big events as opportunities rather than threats can also help. </p> <p>These skills are known as self-regulation, and experts say they can have a dramatic impact on student performance. <a href=\"https://educationendowmentfoundation.org.uk/evidence/teaching-learning-toolkit/meta-cognition-and-self-regulation/\">The Education Endowment Foundation</a> reports that these kinds of interventions are among the most effective for helping students improve, adding on average eight months of additional progress. </p> <h2>Mental toughness</h2> <p>This means having high levels of motivation, being able to cope with setbacks, and being focused on goals. These skills are vital to Paralympians \u2013 the ability to stay motivated and confident over a long period of time is critical when training for an event that only takes place every four years.</p> <p>The educational equivalent is often known as \u201cgrit\u201d; a concept defined by psychologist Angela Duckworth as a <a href=\"https://www.ted.com/talks/angela_lee_duckworth_grit_the_power_of_passion_and_perseverance\">combination of passion and perseverance for long-term goals</a>. It won\u2019t necessarily have a huge impact on grades \u2013 a <a href=\"https://kclpure.kcl.ac.uk/portal/files/47157228/Rimfeld_et_al_True_Grit_paper.pdf\">recent review</a> found that grit only accounted for 0.5% difference in student\u2019s GCSE results \u2013 but <a href=\"http://thepsychologypodcast.com/angela-duckworth-on-grit-the-power-of-passion-and-perseverance/\">Duckworth says</a> it can help to prevent at-risk students from dropping out of school.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/teacher-network/2016/feb/24/four-neuromyths-still-prevalent-in-schools-debunked\">Four neuromyths that are still prevalent in schools \u2013 debunked</a> </p> </aside>  <h2>Vigour</h2> <p>Vigour means having high levels of energy, effort and drive. Yet this is hard \u2013 if not impossible \u2013 to teach. What teachers can do, however, is build an environment and motivational climate where those with high vigour can flourish, and hopefully inspire others. </p> <p>Teachers can help to nurture students\u2019 internal motivation by creating a clear sense of purpose in the classroom. <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://sdtheory.s3.amazonaws.com/SDT/documents/2002_ReeveJangetal_MOEM.pdf\">In one study</a> (pdf), students were divided into four groups and taught a new foreign language. Each group was given different incentives and motivation. Group one wasn\u2019t given any reason why they were learning the language; group two was told they would be tested at the end of the course; group three was told it was what was expected of them; and group four were told it would help them achieve their future career goals. The results were clear \u2013 the fourth group rated the foreign language lessons as more important and put the most effort into their studies.</p> <p>Creating a sense of purpose needn\u2019t be complicated. Teachers can do this by informing students how doing well in the current task will help them to develop important skills, improve performance in their other subjects and make progress towards future plans. <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <h2>Optimism</h2> <p>Paralympians and Olympians have been found to be <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://fitnessforlife.org/AcuCustom/Sitename/Documents/DocumentItem/01_J3644%20JCSP%205_3_Martin_2011.pdf\">more optimistic than the average person</a>. In psychology, optimism is measured by how someone perceives their successes or failures. They can be temporary or permanent (\u201cToday was a bad day\u201d v \u201cThings will always be bad\u201d), and specific or general (\u201cI am not good at this\u201d v \u201cI am not good at anything\u201d).</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/teacher-network/2016/mar/08/children-mobile-phone-distraction-study-school\">Fomo, stress and sleeplessness: are smartphones bad for students?</a> </p> </aside>  <p><a href=\"http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/03054980902934563\">Optimism</a> has been studied extensively in relation to schools.

Conversely, a pessimistic outlook is seen as a strong predictor of <a href=\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0092656607000207\">high levels of hostility and fear in high school students</a>. </p> <h2>Control</h2> <p>Our brains can struggle with uncertainty \u2013 not knowing what will happen often leads to nervousness or stress. This is why many athletes talk about being \u201cprocess-focused\u201d; they concentrate on what they can control, which usually means their strategies, routines and performance.</p> <p>Students can take a similar approach by focusing their efforts on \u201ccontrolling the controllables\u201d. This can be done by developing a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/teacher-network/2016/may/10/six-ways-students-can-prepare-for-success-on-the-day-of-an-exam\">pre-exam routine</a> or creating <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/teacher-network/2016/jun/08/seven-scientific-ways-beat-panic-exam\">strategies that reduce confusion and doubt</a>.

Does the PM plan to persuade the United States to change its diplomatic priorities, and if so how?</p> <p>Over the last few months a points-based immigration system has been proposed by the Foreign Secretary, the International Trade Secretary, the International Development Secretary, the Environment Secretary and the Transport Secretary. Can the PM confirm that she disagrees with all of them?</p> <p>A points-based immigration system was one of the Leave campaign\u2019s key promises.

  "<p>In October 1998, the New Yorker asked me to photograph a \u201cmajor-league ex-dictator\u201d. I took that to mean <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2003/jul/24/fiction.gilesfoden\">Idi Amin</a>, but in actual fact it was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/pinochet\">Augusto Pinochet</a>. He was renowned for being difficult so I knew it was going to be a tough shoot. That\u2019s why the Dorchester Hotel came up. There was a suite there I was familiar with. I knew that if I pre-lit five rooms, it would be difficult for him to reject them all.</p> <p>Initially, though, I didn\u2019t know who it was and I thought it would be interesting to do the shoot out on the streets of London. When I found out it was Pinochet, I decided against that. I knew a number of Chilean people living in the city and I didn\u2019t like the idea of having him in the street. I wanted to contain the situation.</p> <p>I was also friends with a young photographer who had lost two brothers in Chile\u2019s \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/1999/aug/11/pinochet.chile\">disappearings</a>\u201d. That definitely added a dimension to how I was feeling, yet there isn\u2019t anybody I would refuse to photograph. I was completely aware of what Pinochet stood for, that he was a mass murderer, but that didn\u2019t stop me. Where you stand politically doesn\u2019t sway whether you should photograph somebody.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>He probably won't even acknowledge you</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>However, my friend\u2019s experience left me uneasy about shaking Pinochet\u2019s hand. Jon Lee Anderson, who wrote <a href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1998/10/19/the-dictator\">the article my portrait accompanied</a>, had already done a number of interviews with him. He said that, the whole time, Pinochet had never looked at him directly. \u201cHe probably won\u2019t even acknowledge you,\u201d he said.</p> <p>But when Pinochet walked in, he looked at me directly, and walked towards me, hand outstretched. I was completely unprepared. There\u2019s nothing you can do when somebody puts their hand out to you but shake it, so I did. Once I\u2019d got over that, I took him to the first location: beside a big window, with just natural light. The flame red background was already there, as were the glasses. His hand on the table looked like a claw. I think this shot might even have been the first frame of the shoot. That happens a lot \u2013 the first and the last are the ones that work.</p> <p>I was distinctly aware, all the time, that I was in the presence of a terrible, terrible man \u2013 the charges that were laid against him, the thousands of people who had disappeared. It\u2019s strange going into a shoot where you know the subject\u2019s history: it doesn\u2019t have a bearing on how you photograph, but it does have a bearing on how you feel.</p> <p>He carried himself like a world leader. I\u2019ve photographed a number of people who are presidential, or have been leaders of countries, and he had that same demeanour. There\u2019s an authoritative arrogance about them. It was the same with Blair. I don\u2019t have much respect for those who take on the mantle of power. I\u2019ve met quite a few and they never really impress me.</p> <p></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"9f09a087cfead8238b7eaecb072abefd667422e0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9f09a087cfead8238b7eaecb072abefd667422e0/0_0_1200_1701/705.jpg\" alt=\"Steve Pyke\" width=\"705\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Steve Pyke</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Eamonn McCabe for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Steve Pyke\u2019s CV<br></h2> <p><strong>Born:</strong> Leicester, 1957.</p> <p><strong>Training:</strong> \u201cNo formal training.

  "<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/05/gender-wage-gap-women-pay-raise-men-study\">Women ask for pay increases as often as men but receive them less, study says</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Many believe the stereotype that men and women approach salary negotiations very differently. </p> <p>The conventional wisdom is that after only a few months on the job, men will waltz into their boss\u2019s office unannounced, slam their fist of the table and demand more money. This chutzpah, of course, results in a raise. Meanwhile women who have worked for 10 years at the same company still feel undeserving of a salary top-up. \u201cI don\u2019t want to come across as entitled,\u201d they say to each other wistfully over crantinis. \u201cI still have so much to learn.\u201d</p> <p>Misogynists use the above scenario to illustrate why women themselves are to blame for the pay gap. \u201cChicks earn 21% less than men because they\u2019re afraid to speak up!\u201d they\u2019ll say. Thankfully, a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/05/gender-wage-gap-women-pay-raise-men-study\">recent study</a> that uses data from Australian workers disproves that faulty logic. Researchers from universities in the US and UK found that both genders ask for pay raises with the same frequency. That\u2019s right, women earn less because of good ol\u2019 fashioned discrimination. It\u2019s no surprise, since for most of history work cultures were created by men to help other men advance. The pay gap will only close once companies become environments that cater more to the female sex.</p> <p>In popular culture and actual workplaces, men still hold the majority of powerful positions. Donald Draper. Francis Underwood. Tony Soprano. In corporate America, less than <a href=\"http://money.cnn.com/2015/03/24/investing/female-ceo-pipeline-leadership/\">15%</a> of the top leadership roles are held by women and <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/01/05/the-new-congress-is-80-percent-white-80-percent-male-and-92-percent-christian/\">80% </a>of members in the US Congress members are male. That degree of industry dominance leads to discrimination against women, particularly women of color, that manifests in not-so-subtle ways.</p> <p>Supposed feminine qualities such as collaboration, empathy and self-doubt are seen as weaknesses, despite research that shows <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/friedaklotz/2011/11/08/why-women-make-better-leaders/2/#3c1dc50621f1\">they motivate</a> employees. The result is that many females feel they must act more like powerful men to succeed. <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/angelina-chapin/confidence-gap-women_b_5191293.html\">Around 42%</a> of senior women take on masculine characteristics to \u201cget ahead\u201d, according to UK telecommunications firm O2. Yet the last thing this world needs is more megalomaniacs who think their authoritative demeanour makes them fit to run a country or a company.</p> <p>In addition to behavioural discrimination, there\u2019s a larger structural imbalance that explains why women earn less than men: they are <a href=\"https://thinkprogress.org/even-today-women-still-do-most-of-the-housework-and-childcare-ea8b11e7aee1#.nb8sd1wcc\">still</a> the primary caregivers for children and parents. Even though fewer women are full-time housewives, their home responsibilities have a tangible effect on their careers. In a previous column <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/apr/21/harriet-tubman-20-bill-women-still-earn-fewer-than-men-gender-wage-equality\">I\u2019ve cited the research</a> by economist and Harvard professor Claudia Goldin, who found the best explanation for the pay gap is that a decade into their careers, many women will take less prestigious jobs that allow for more flexible work hours. </p> <p>\u201cWhen women then have children, or again are caring for their own parents or other sick family members who need care, then they need to work differently,\u201d writes scholar Anne-Marie Slaughter in her book titled Unfinished Business. \u201cThey need to work flexibility, and often go part-time.\u201d</p> <p>So rather than become partner at a big criminal law firm, a job that doesn\u2019t easily allow for 4pm daycare pickups, many women self-demote themselves to smaller firms or part-time work. Because of their home life responsibilities, many mothers and caretakers don\u2019t have the luxury of taking the high-paying jobs which would help close the pay gap.</p> <p>The idea that women make less because they are reluctant to ask for more money is an anti-feminist fallacy. Female employees are repeatedly disadvantaged in a workplace that still equates masculinity with competence and a society that expects them to prioritize their families over leadership positions. Companies can help shrink the gap with work-from-home policies and a culture that evaluates staff based on their results, rather than the amount of hours they put in. And more men can take on caregiving duties so their female partners can both be mothers and focus on professional success.</p>",

  "<h2><em>Arizona Cardinals </em></h2> <p>It\u2019s time for the Cardinals to finally win a Super Bowl. After being blown out in last season\u2019s NFC championship game by the Carolina Panthers, the Cardinals have upgraded their weakest position -pass rush- with the addition of Chandler Jones by way of a trade with the New England Patriots. The return to fitness of Tyrann Mathieu, one of the leagues very best defensive players, will ensure the Cardinals defense will match their offense in terms of skill and playmaking ability. Not forgetting the Cardinals have one of the best coaches in the league in Bruce Arians. <strong><em>Tom Marshall </em></strong></p> <p>The most important thing will be to keep quarterback Carson Palmer healthy. He had such a strong regular season last year, but then faltered in the post-season and ultimately cost the team a chance at the Super Bowl with his horrendous performance against the Panthers. </p> <p>The addition of Chandler Jones gives their defence a legit pass-rush threat that they have sorely lacked for a number of years. Keep him healthy and there\u2019s no reason why he can\u2019t notch double-digit sacks this season. Hopefully rookie defensive lineman Robert Nkemdiche also gets in on the act and proves that the Cardinals got a steal with him late in the first round. If these things happen, we may finally get a Lombardi Trophy in Arizona. <strong><em>Tom Donlan </em></strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a5e68aa7e3fc6e6de90088c36958757ce878944e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a5e68aa7e3fc6e6de90088c36958757ce878944e/0_0_4320_3124/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Arizona Cardinals free safety Tyrann Mathieu warms up prior to an NFL pre-season game against the Denver Broncos, Thursday, Sept. 1, 2016, in Glendale, Ariz.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"723\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Arizona Cardinals free safety Tyrann Mathieu warms up prior to an NFL pre-season game against the Denver Broncos, Thursday, Sept. 1, 2016, in Glendale, Ariz.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rick Scuteri/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><em>Atlanta Falcons </em></h2> <p>I watched the Super Bowl for the first time in 1999 with my dad. Despite their 34-19 defeat to Denver Broncos, I wanted to support the underdogs, especially after their amazing season. So I grew to like Atlanta Falcons. That makes it 16 seasons and counting. </p> <p>Last year hurt. We looked incredible after a 5-0 start under head coach Dan Quinn, but we fell to pieces which wasn\u2019t pretty. If quarterback Matt Ryan, Julio Jones, Devonta Freeman and a slightly improved offensive line show their promise this year, I\u2019m expecting a push for the playoffs - probably a wildcard place in NFC South. Hopefully Quinn has fixed up the defence. We need better defensive performances and more creativity if we are to improve this season. <strong><em>Geoff Hunt</em></strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ec3bc9496e81906a8284e003fcb084ef0fb1870d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ec3bc9496e81906a8284e003fcb084ef0fb1870d/0_0_4473_2982/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A lot rests on quarterback Matt Ryan this season if Atlanta Falcons are to have a successful year\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A lot rests on quarterback Matt Ryan this season if Atlanta Falcons are to have a successful year</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dale Zanine/USA Today Sports</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong><em>Baltimore Ravens </em></strong></h2> <p>I have been a fan of the Ravens since 2010. My favourite player of all time has to be Ray Lewis. He was such an emotional leader of his teams as well as such a physical talent. The best season of all time was 2012, when the Ravens beat San Francisco 49ers 34-31 in the Super Bowl. It was Ray Lewis\u2019s final ever NFL game and the perfect way to bow out. We had a disastrously poor season last year, with the Ravens failing to perform all year and not reaching the playoffs. Hopefully this season will be an improvement. </p> <p>This year it would be nice to have a healthy roster and see wide receiver Breshad Perriman have a good season. If we can make it to the playoffs that would be a good season in my books. If our quarterback Joe Flacco can stay fit after his knee problems, then we can do well. We also need to improve our defensive play. That is a cornerstone of good Ravens football and we need to get back to that. <strong><em>Daryl Anderson</em></strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4bad618dcd6003ce42a86972e921eba64ef67396\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4bad618dcd6003ce42a86972e921eba64ef67396/0_0_3863_2575/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Can Baltimore Ravens quarterback Joe Flacco stay fit for the campaign?\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Can Baltimore Ravens quarterback Joe Flacco stay fit for the campaign?</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tommy Gilligan/USA Today Sports</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong><em>Buffalo Bills </em></strong></h2> <p>My hopes are that the Bills finally play up to the talent on the roster. We\u2019ve never had a team this good on paper across all phases, and the real question mark hangs over head coach Rex Ryan. I\u2019ve learned not to expect a 10-6 or playoff season, though it isn\u2019t out of reach. I expect the offence to be explosive and frustrating in equal measure, with a heavy dose of the run game punctuated with big passing plays that play to quarterback Tyrod Taylor\u2019s strengths. It won\u2019t always be pretty but it should be effective. </p> <p>On D I expect a huge improvement on last year (it can\u2019t get much worse!), maybe not the top five Rex promised the world, but a top 10-15 would stop us losing games that we should win. The questions are whether Ryan can get the team playing disciplined football, whether Tyrod Taylor and Sammy Watkins can stay healthy and build on last season, and whether young players like Ronald Derby can continue stepping up. I expect to be entertained and there is definitely cause to be optimistic as there always is in pre-season! <strong><em>Craig Warner</em></strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e9a9750d627b673305afdceedcc1d566590779b3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e9a9750d627b673305afdceedcc1d566590779b3/0_0_4036_3078/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Buffalo Bills quarterback Tyrod Taylor is chased by New York Giants defensive end Olivier Vernon from the pocket during a pre-season game.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"763\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Buffalo Bills quarterback Tyrod Taylor is chased by New York Giants defensive end Olivier Vernon from the pocket during a pre-season game.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kevin Hoffman/USA Today Sports</span> </figcaption> </figure> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2016/aug/31/nfc-south-season-preview-carolina-panthers\">NFC South season preview: were the Panthers a one-year wonder?</a> </p> </aside>  <h2><strong><em>Chicago Bears</em></strong></h2> <p>With an upgraded defence, two genuine quality receivers, a kind looking schedule and coach John Fox in his second season, there\u2019s nothing to say we can\u2019t get to the playoffs. <strong><em>Milan Joshi </em></strong></p> <p>With our decent draft and free agency manoeuvres, I\u2019m hoping for a push towards a playoff place. I trust head coach Fox and think he\u2019s the right man for the job, but fear the job is bigger than he first thought. Jay Cutler will need to rediscover his pre-humungous contract form and to do that Alshon Jeffery will have to maintain his fitness for a full season. Both are big asks and long shots. Jeffery should be motivated in a contract year and Kevin White playing alongside him will hopefully help spread some of the coverage.

I was totally transfixed with the brown and orange colours of the team\u2019s jerseys. Some say it\u2019s not the nicest combination but I think it\u2019s magical. Bernie Kosar is my favourite ever player. Back in the 80s the Browns would challenge the Broncos and Steelers at the very top. The last couple of seasons have been a total living nightmare- we are usually out of the running by October. </p> <p>I\u2019m optimistic about the new coach Hue Jackson and pray he can make us a little bit more competitive. It would be nice if we were still in the running for something by the time Thanksgiving comes around this year. That would be small progress but progress all the same. <strong><em>Paul Tate</em></strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0590451d347dd0893349e631137fb5e0e34976ba\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0590451d347dd0893349e631137fb5e0e34976ba/0_0_3669_2534/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Will wide receiver Josh Gordon and quarterback Robert Griffin III inspire Cleveland Browns to be competitive this season?\" width=\"1000\" height=\"691\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Will wide receiver Josh Gordon and quarterback Robert Griffin III inspire Cleveland Browns to be competitive this season?</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jason Behnken/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong><em>Dallas Cowboys</em></strong></h2> <p>Winning the NFC East is the main hope. After last year a return to a competitive season is a must and a promising rookie season for Ezekiel Elliott would help the Cowboys achieve that. The health of quarterback Tony Romo is key to everything at the AT&amp;T Stadium, so <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/27/cowboys-tony-romo-facing-six-to-10-weeks-out-with-broken-bone-in-back\">news of his injury before the season has even started</a> is a major blow. The defence also needs to gel to offset a lack of top tier talent and a number of injuries and suspensions. <strong><em>Luk</em></strong><strong><em>e Harrison</em></strong></p> <p>We had a great season in 2014, when DeMarco Murray was outstanding. I was so disappointed last season because it started off so well and lack of good backup quarterback hurt us big time. There weren\u2019t many positives around the club, so this season will hopefully be better. If we keep everyone fit, the offence can be the star this season. It\u2019s one of the best in the division, and it always has been. But our defence won\u2019t win the Super Bowl unfortunately. I\u2019d love someone to come through the ranks to give Tony Romo a reliable backup. Could Dak Prescott possibly be that guy? <strong><em>Oli </em></strong><strong><em>Davies</em></strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bc5cdedfd85d52ff0c38b094c5e63d1f74cc424c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bc5cdedfd85d52ff0c38b094c5e63d1f74cc424c/0_0_2965_1977/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Dallas Cowboys quarterback Dak Prescott throws a pass in the second quarter of a pre-season friendly against the Miami Dolphins at AT&amp;T Stadium.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dallas Cowboys quarterback Dak Prescott throws a pass in the second quarter of a pre-season friendly against the Miami Dolphins at AT&amp;T Stadium.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tim Heitman/USA Today Sports</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong><em>Detroit Lions</em></strong></h2> <p>There\u2019s no realistic route to the playoffs this year. I can\u2019t see us getting past strong Packers and Vikings teams, but I\u2019d be happy if I feel things are going in the right direction. Offensive coordinator Jim Bob Cooter must get the best out of quarterback Matt Stafford. I\u2019d also like to see the receiver core not losing too much ground from last year, which is possible if Marvin Jones steps up. It would be nice to actually have a running game of some kind... Going 8-8 without \u201cMegatron\u201d Calvin Johnson, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/mar/08/detroit-lions-receiver-calvin-johnson-retires-nfl\">who announced his retirement earlier this year</a>, would feel like an achievement. <strong><em>Joe </em></strong><strong><em>Sturge</em></strong></p> <p>The Lions\u2019 division will be difficult this year with Green Bay likely to get back to their best, Minnesota a team on the rise and the Bears having made some good free agency moves. I\u2019d hope the Lions can get close to 9-7 and a Wildcard slot. After a disastrous start last year they finished well. It could come down to their ability to close out close games. That\u2019s something they didn\u2019t do enough of last year. The Lions have to find a way to replace the catches, yards and touchdowns of retired Calvin Johnson. He was a great safety blanket for Matt Stafford. We could do with a good second season from Ameer Abdullah. On the other side of the ball the defence needs to help out Ziggy Ansah. He can\u2019t do it all on his own. Hopefully a fully fit DeAndre Levy will help after he missed most of last year. <strong><em>Phil Ashford</em></strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b1f18b6748d48b0a40d16d69c431dfb9e6cd93a0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b1f18b6748d48b0a40d16d69c431dfb9e6cd93a0/0_0_4320_3048/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Detroit Lions wide receiver Jeremy Kerley runs after a catch past Pittsburgh Steelers cornerback Dorian Grant during a pre-season friendly at Heinz Field.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"706\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Detroit Lions wide receiver Jeremy Kerley runs after a catch past Pittsburgh Steelers cornerback Dorian Grant during a pre-season friendly at Heinz Field.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Charles LeClaire/USA Today Sports</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong><em>Denver Broncos </em></strong></h2> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2016/sep/05/afc-west-season-preview-denver-broncos-oakland-raiders-chiefs-chargers\">AFC West season preview: the Broncos could well go from first to worst</a> </p> </aside>  <p>I certainly expect the Broncos to make the playoffs this year. Although it will be tough playing in a division as competitive as the AFC West, where you could honestly make a case that every team could make the playoffs. I think the defence will once again top the league in total defence and I expect that the offence will be powered by the running game. </p> <p>The absolute essential key will be quarterback play. The Broncos don\u2019t need an Aaron Rodgers. All they need is an average quarterback that can move the chains, hand the ball off and most importantly turn the ball over a lot less. That was the big question mark over Mark Sanchez, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/sep/03/mark-sanchez-dallas-cowboys-one-year-contract\">the reason we let him go to Dallas Cowboys</a>. He can make some plays, but he is prone to turning the ball over. If we can get a 10-6 season and make the playoffs, well you never know right? Who picked the Broncos to win the super bowl last year? It\u2019s football anything can happen. <strong><em>Frank Walker</em></strong></p> <p>I almost don\u2019t want this year to start as we still bask in the glow of a Super Bowl victory. This year will be not much different to last year despite Peyton Manning\u2019s departure. I would expect to make the Playoffs despite the AFC West being a much rougher road to travel now then it was 12 months ago. I wouldn\u2019t hold my breath about getting back to the Super Bowl with the Patriots and Steelers looking too strong at this point in the AFC. <strong><em>Matt Beesley</em></strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0f496b74337049347ff66c79c0550c6f9db9f7c1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0f496b74337049347ff66c79c0550c6f9db9f7c1/0_0_3500_2268/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Former Denver Broncos quarterback Peyton Manning waves to the crowd after helping to clinch the 50th Super Bowl against Carolina Panthers\" width=\"1000\" height=\"648\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Former Denver Broncos quarterback Peyton Manning waves to the crowd after helping to clinch the 50th Super Bowl against Carolina Panthers</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Usa Today Sports/USA Today Sports</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong><em>Green Bay Packers </em></strong></h2> <p>I expect the Pack at the very least to make the NFC Championship game, but the hope is to reach another Super Bowl while Aaron Rodgers is in his prime. He\u2019s the best quarterback in the NFL. Last season he struggled with an ever-changing receiving corp, but I believe this will be a strength rather than a weakness going into the new season. </p> <p>Jordy Nelson is back from his ACL injury and thus Randall Cobb can go back to his natural position to recreate what was the most potent WR duo of the 2014 NFL season. Jared Abbrederis and Jeff Janis have shown they can add an extra dimension to the WRs, and Jared Cook will bring some much needed athleticism to the tight-end position. Rodgers should have plenty of targets and, if the O-line, and the slimmed-down Eddie Lacy do their job, the Packers offence could be incredibly difficult to stop. <strong><em>Patrick Clinton-Dix</em></strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"483b3db10315da9d6381d5f12580f37abd6effd8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/483b3db10315da9d6381d5f12580f37abd6effd8/0_0_4674_3236/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Green Bay Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers looks on prior to the 2016 Hall of Fame Game at Tom Benson Hall of Fame Stadium.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"692\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Green Bay Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers looks on prior to the 2016 Hall of Fame Game at Tom Benson Hall of Fame Stadium.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Aaron Doster/USA Today Sports</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong><em>Houston Texans </em></strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"4eb7edb444caffdab2dfc3272543673bb25966f5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4eb7edb444caffdab2dfc3272543673bb25966f5/0_0_768_1024/750.jpg\" alt=\"Graham Henderson - \u2018The Kilted Texan\u2019\" width=\"750\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Graham Henderson - \u2018The Kilted Texan\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Graham Henderson</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Like any fan I hope that my team will win the Super Bowl. And what better incentive for the Texans this year than the fact it will be held in their home stadium. That should be motivation enough to make that dream come true. The sobering truth though is that, although we have improved this off-season, I still think the Super Bowl will be just be out of reach. I do believe we will win the AFC South and I\u2018m also hopeful of a deep playoff run. </p> <p>The key to success for the Texans this year is that our newly bolstered offense can match up to the high standards set by our defence. We went big this off season acquiring what we believe is a highly talented quarterback and a very good running back. A lot of money was spent bringing Brock Osweiler away from the Super Bowl winning Broncos and for good reason. The quarterback position has been a problem for us the last couple of seasons so bringing in a real talent at that position was a must. Lamarr Miller was brought in to replace the ailing Arian Foster and I think that was a clever move. Miami did not use him nearly enough and I think with the workload the Texans are offering he will shine brightly and give the Texans that ground game they had two seasons ago that dominated so much. </p> <p>JJ Watt is looking to play in the season opener so let\u2019s just hope he hasn\u2019t come back too soon. We also need Jadeveon Clowney to be the player we expected him to be when we drafted him first in 2014. If Watt and Clowney are firing on all cylinders, they\u2019ll be fearsome duo and could potentially lead us to that deep playoff run or Super Bowl ring all Texan fans are looking for. <strong><em>Graham Henderson</em></strong> The Kilted Texan<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0ead8cfec3795b80618a5f1eb46438078a65377b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0ead8cfec3795b80618a5f1eb46438078a65377b/0_0_4284_2847/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Joel Heath and Ufomba Kamalu of the Houston Texans celebrate after recovering a fumble against the Arizona Cardinals in the third quarter of a preseason NFL game at NRG Stadium on August 28, 2016 in Houston, Texas.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"665\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Joel Heath and Ufomba Kamalu of the Houston Texans celebrate after recovering a fumble against the Arizona Cardinals in the third quarter of a preseason NFL game at NRG Stadium on August 28, 2016 in Houston, Texas.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Joe Robbins/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong><em>Indianapolis Colts</em></strong><br></h2> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/30/afc-south-preview-andrew-luck-indianapolis-colts-nfl\">AFC South questions for 2016: can Andrew Luck drag the Colts to the postseason?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Last year was a real let down. Having signed Frank Gore and Andre Johnson (already released ahead of this season), as well as quarterback Andrew Luck being on a steady upward curve, I thought we could have gone deep into the playoffs. However, the O-Line was terrible, Luck was injured most of the season and we couldn\u2019t even muster a winning record.</p> <p>Topping the division and making the playoffs this season is still the hope, but with teams in the AFC South all adding depth in free agency it will be tough. A lot of our success will rest on the offensive line\u2019s ability to hold up, allowing quarterback Andrew Luck time in the pocket. The hope is also that Luck stays fit and cuts out interceptions, which he struggled with last year. <strong><em>Declan Maher</em></strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f52c58cf1236600b50eb12b520d2be1ef2f0d2bd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f52c58cf1236600b50eb12b520d2be1ef2f0d2bd/0_0_3600_2384/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Indianapolis Colts quarterback Andrew Luck on the sidelines during pre-season against the Philadelphia Eagles at Lucas Oil Stadium.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"662\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Indianapolis Colts quarterback Andrew Luck on the sidelines during pre-season against the Philadelphia Eagles at Lucas Oil Stadium.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Thomas  J.

Tight end Julius Thomas is finally getting intigrated, and with the addition of running back Chris Ivory to smash in the touchdowns, we look scarily good. The additions at Defense need to have an immediate impact and the whole outfit needs to be tighter so the Offense can have more time to do their thing. <strong><em>Mark</em></strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"11679cf78de0c1cbd01193a073b1dea7c103ceea\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/11679cf78de0c1cbd01193a073b1dea7c103ceea/0_0_3507_2541/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jacksonville Jaguars tight end Julius Thomas attempts to catch a pass against the Buffalo Bills during last season\u2019s NFL International Series game at Wembley Stadium.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"725\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jacksonville Jaguars tight end Julius Thomas attempts to catch a pass against the Buffalo Bills during last season\u2019s NFL International Series game at Wembley Stadium.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kirby Lee-USA TODAY Sports/USA Today Sports</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong><em>Kansas City Chiefs</em></strong></h2> <p>My hope ahead of the season is to win the AFC West for the first time since 2010, get a first round bye and progress to the AFC championship game. The O-line needs to improve in pass protection to allow our quarterback Alex Smith time to throw. Another wide receiver needs to emerge behind WR#2 has to emerge behind Jeremy Maclin and Travis Kelce in the passing game to force opposing defenses to respect the passing game. This would allow running backs Jamaal Charles, Spencer Ware and Charcandrick West to take advantage of a less stacked box in the run game. <strong><em>Alex </em></strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b3e3738acfc7c9b3c0e835ac83942290aa93e81d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b3e3738acfc7c9b3c0e835ac83942290aa93e81d/0_0_3000_1889/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Kansas City Chiefs quarterback Alex Smith calls a play during the first half of last season\u2019s NFL Wildcard playoff football game against the Houston Texans.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"630\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Kansas City Chiefs quarterback Alex Smith calls a play during the first half of last season\u2019s NFL Wildcard playoff football game against the Houston Texans.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: George Bridges/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong><em>Los Angeles Rams</em></strong></h2> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2016/sep/06/nfc-west-preview-seattle-seahawks-los-angeles-rams-jared-goff\">NFC West preview: is No1 pick Jared Goff already a bust for the Rams?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>I\u2019ve been a fan of the Rams since 1986 and am pleased they have moved back to LA. I think we can finally have a winning season and maybe sneak a wildcard spot. I hope that Jared Goff lives up to his lofty draft pick or it could set the franchise back again. The key to success this season is to play great defence led by Aaron Donald, the O Line needs to block for Todd Gurley and Case Keenum has to manage the game. If Goff progresses and is ready to take the field at some point this season, then hopefully it takes us to a playoff spot. <strong><em>Nick Henderson </em></strong></p> <p>I hope the Rams make the playoffs, and that young quarterback Jared Goff continues his development. If we continue to win without him, I would be happy for Goff to sit for the season and learn. We need to improve offensively. The efficiency of quarterback by Case Keenum will be the most important thing for the Rams to make the playoffs. We were only just out of the playoffs with perhaps the worst offence in the league last season, so anything better than that should have us in contention. <strong><em>Zaimondos</em></strong><br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a18563132ecb1bc7432aa5b02bb93adf37647fcb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a18563132ecb1bc7432aa5b02bb93adf37647fcb/0_0_2164_1528/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Will Los Angeles Rams quarterback Case Keenum have an efficient enough season for his side to reach the playoffs this year?\" width=\"1000\" height=\"706\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Will Los Angeles Rams quarterback Case Keenum have an efficient enough season for his side to reach the playoffs this year?</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kirby Lee/USA Today Sports</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong><em>Miami Dolphins</em></strong></h2> <p>After some very meagre seasons in AFL East, expectations are low and optimism is even lower.

The Vikings are becoming a real force in the NFL. With a young and upcoming squad, a quarterback starting to show his potential and a brand-new stadium which holds over 66,000, this season could be very excited for the team and its fans. We look solid in defence and unpredictable pushing forward, the roster is strong and is more than capable of upsetting the odds this season. </p> <p>Unfortunately the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/30/teddy-bridgewater-injury-minnesota-vikings-nfl\">serious pre-season injury</a> suffered by our young and promising quarterback Teddy Bridgewater has rocked the team. He struggled in his first term with the Vikings last season but had impressed so far and he will be a huge loss. The pressure on running back Adrian Peterson just got a whole lot bigger. <strong><em>Nathan Evans</em></strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fdc944c38ac86163a73b79aabbac6b4939b07b23\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fdc944c38ac86163a73b79aabbac6b4939b07b23/0_0_4674_3042/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Minnesota Vikings running back Adrian Peterson will need to have a good season if the Vikings are to fulfill their potential.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"651\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Minnesota Vikings running back Adrian Peterson will need to have a good season if the Vikings are to fulfill their potential.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Butch Dill/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong><em>New England Patriots </em></strong></h2> <p>I hope we see New England in their sixth consecutive AFC Championship game this season.

An awesome attack was time and again let down by a woeful defence. It provided some great entertainment at times - beating the Giants 52-49 and a few very close run games against Panthers. But it felt like all the hard work done by quarterback Drew Brees was for nothing. </p> <p>A new defensive coordinator in Dennis Allen improved the final few games but the bar was set epically low. Even a middling defence coupled with a strong offence should result in perhaps a Wildcard entrance to the playoffs. Carolina Panthers still look the team to beat in the South, but we should rightfully expect to be better than Atlanta Falcons and Tampa Bay Buccaneers. We need a few pieces to stay fit to give Brees\u2019s shoulders a rest, but a 9-7 is within grasp. <strong><em>Liam</em></strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3d104f73d53acc845379088a93beef384c2665d9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3d104f73d53acc845379088a93beef384c2665d9/0_0_2314_1621/1000.jpg\" alt=\"New Orleans Saints quarterback Drew Brees makes a throw in the second quarter of the pre-season game against the Pittsburgh Steelers at the Mercedes-Benz Superdome.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"701\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">New Orleans Saints quarterback Drew Brees makes a throw in the second quarter of the pre-season game against the Pittsburgh Steelers at the Mercedes-Benz Superdome.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Chuck Cook/USA Today Sports</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong><em>New York Giants </em></strong></h2> <p>A lot of fans are saying a playoff run or bust given our expensive offseason, but I\u2019ll settle for steady progress. I\u2019d also like to see us close out games where we\u2019re leading. We blew an awful lot of leads last year. If we can finish above .500 (8-8) and everyone stays healthy (yes Victor Cruz that means you), I\u2019ll be happy. The roster on paper is very talented, if they play they\u2019ll perform. If our wide receiver Odell Beckham Jr. plays 16 games, he\u2019ll top 1,500 receiving yards without a doubt. <strong><em>Ben </em></strong></p> <p>Our weakness since winning the Super Bowl in 2012 has been defence. If some games last season had been 30 seconds shorter, we\u2019d have finished 11-5. In all those instances it was a weak defence that was to blame. We can definitely convert to being a very dangerous team so long as we hold up in the clutch defence moments. In Eli Manning and Odell Beckham Jr. we have a fierce offence pair. If our Secondary holds itself together with the new additions, and if wide receiver Victor Cruz picks up near the ability he had when he last played, there is nothing stopping us making the playoffs or even the Super Bowl itself.<strong><em> Elliot </em></strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"641ed5ac7692cdbd0c29da06c465b0e13f423d17\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/641ed5ac7692cdbd0c29da06c465b0e13f423d17/0_0_5015_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"New York Giants quarterback Eli Manning talks with wide receiver Odell Beckham during a pre-season game against Buffalo Bills at New Era Field.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"689\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">New York Giants quarterback Eli Manning talks with wide receiver Odell Beckham Jr. during a pre-season game against Buffalo Bills at New Era Field.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kevin Hoffman/USA Today Sports</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"a7ccaefdb944e14262aaaa4a41ac7136a1e684c2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a7ccaefdb944e14262aaaa4a41ac7136a1e684c2/0_0_536_536/500.jpg\" alt=\"Greg Smith\" width=\"500\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Greg Smith</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Greg Smith</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong><em>New York Jets</em></strong></h2> <p>After finishing 10-6 last season, and just missing the playoffs, I\u2019m hoping that we pick up where we left off. All the pieces are in place to contend for a wildcard playoff spot come January. It all comes down to quarterback Ryan Fitzpatrick. He broke franchise records last year by throwing for 31 touchdowns. If he can repeat that performance or come close, our defence is strong enough to carry the rest of the team to victory. </p> <p>The Jets are yet to win a Super Bowl in my life time. Having said that I\u2019ve enjoyed every season supporting them, because the teams are all so competitive in the AFC East. Last season was probably the most disappointing as we had all the players to make it to the playoffs. Quarterback Ryan Fitzpatrick had a poor game against Buffalo Bills on the last day of the regular season, and it spiralled out of control from there. <strong><em>Greg Smith </em></strong><br></p> <p>I expect the Jets to make it to the playoffs again at the very least. Their defense is one of the best in the game and feared by all quarterbacks. I\u2019m made up that the Jets found a way to bring back Fitzpatrick this year. He\u2019ll be a very important part of the Jets\u2019 game plan. <strong><em>Haydn </em></strong><strong><em>Gossage</em></strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0c7ce68db9f1faec3e84af9fb8faaca1251819d6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0c7ce68db9f1faec3e84af9fb8faaca1251819d6/0_0_2000_1331/1000.jpg\" alt=\"New York Jets quarterback Ryan Fitzpatrick looks to pass against the Philadelphia Eagles at MetLife Stadium.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"666\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">New York Jets quarterback Ryan Fitzpatrick looks to pass against the Philadelphia Eagles at MetLife Stadium.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Steven Ryan/USA Today Sports</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><em>Oakland Raiders</em></h2> <p>With a promising core of young players on both sides of the ball, and their additions in the offseason, it isn\u2019t unrealistic to think the Raiders could get three more wins and improve to 10-6. The AFC West is going to be so tight this year. I don\u2019t buy the hype that the Broncos are going to implode. Their D will be incredible again. Whoever plays at QB will simply be required to not turn the ball over. The Chiefs are going to be well drilled again and are settled at most key positions. The Chargers simply cannot have the same injury bad luck they had a year ago. I also see their D being much improved with their young linebackers and pass rushers.<br></p> <p>All put together I think Oakland are most likely to improve this year. If they end up 9-7 or 10-6 and miss out on the playoffs I wouldn\u2019t be too disappointed. They will have improved again and the coaching staff will have shown that they are on the right track. The offseason additions need to live up to their names and pay cheques though. There is always the possibility that introducing a lot of new faces can backfire but the Raiders seem to have gone after real pros this off season which gives me reason to be optimistic that this could be a top 10 defence.<strong><em> Tom Kingston</em></strong><br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e3d4cc62292d5ea38368ec0fa5400f22d8d23218\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e3d4cc62292d5ea38368ec0fa5400f22d8d23218/0_0_2611_1855/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Oakland Raiders quarterback Derek Carr greets a young fan before game against the Green Bay Packers at Lambeau Field.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"710\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Oakland Raiders quarterback Derek Carr greets a young fan before game against the Green Bay Packers at Lambeau Field.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Benny Sieu/USA Today Sports</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong><em>Philadelphia Eagles </em></strong></h2> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2016/sep/07/nfc-east-preview-eagles-cowboys-washington-giants\">NFC East preview: do the Eagles and Cowboys have any plausible plans?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Despite the conventional wisdom that teams with new, untested coaches will likely not make an impact in their first year, I am cautiously optimistic that the Eagles will still fight for the top spot in the NFC East under rookie head coach Doug Pederson. We need the defense to be consistent. Strength at the back has been an emerging trademark of the Eagles. We also need to mould another quality quarterback. Our team has struggled mightily with that position for decades and it must be established in this season, whoever stands under center. <strong><em>Edward Marks </em></strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"de765356357183e1f9418d649eb8149a4931a9f7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/de765356357183e1f9418d649eb8149a4931a9f7/0_0_4211_2975/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Philadelphia Eagles head coach Doug Pederson talks to Carson Wentz during a timeout in the pre-season game against Tampa Bay Buccaneers at Lincoln Financial Field.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"706\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Philadelphia Eagles head coach Doug Pederson talks to Carson Wentz during a timeout in the pre-season game against Tampa Bay Buccaneers at Lincoln Financial Field.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mitchell Leff/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong><em>Pittsburgh Steelers </em></strong></h2> <p>For the Steelers the real hope this year is to make it to the 51st Super Bowl. The roster looks really strong and if we stay healthy throughout the season, we won\u2019t be too far away. Steering clear of injuries is the only thing that is a must, but unfortunately this is beyond our control. <strong><em>Tyler</em></strong></p> <p>After the Super Bowl I felt that the Steelers were the favourite to be there in 2017, but no sooner had I looked at the betting odds when Martavis Bryant pushed the limits of fans goodwill by getting his one year ban. Then followed Le\u2019Veon Bell with a three match ban. Add to this the alarming number of players already on the IR list and it just doesn\u2019t feel like the stars are aligning. That said I think we can take the AFC North and then who knows? </p> <p>There has been a lot of criticism about the defence, but by the end of the year we were a top 10 defence in almost every category. If we can build on these improvements and keep the Ben, Brown and Bell fit then at least it will be a entertaining season. I\u2019ll be watching every minute I can. <strong><em>Ted Faulkner</em></strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"473703d7b6d38679c4851f404d2adedcb1ca540e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/473703d7b6d38679c4851f404d2adedcb1ca540e/0_0_4601_3101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Pittsburgh Steelers free safety Mike Mitchell celebrates a play in the second quarter against the New Orleans Saints at the Mercedes-Benz Superdome.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"674\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Pittsburgh Steelers free safety Mike Mitchell celebrates a play in the second quarter against the New Orleans Saints at the Mercedes-Benz Superdome.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Chuck Cook/USA Today Sports</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong><em>San Diego Chargers</em></strong></h2> <p>The Chargers will definitely improve on last year\u2019s terrible season.

They looked so great with Joe Montana and Jerry Rice, and my favourite season as a 49ers fan was when they won the Super Bowl in 1994. Quarterback Steve Young was fantastic that year. My biggest disappointment was probably last season. It\u2019s only been a few years since the 49ers were in the Super Bowl or in the playoffs but to see them be a punchline last season was tough. They didn\u2019t look like they had any plan with all their QB troubles, injuries, and a leaky defence.</p> <p>It\u2019d be nice to think about the playoffs this season, but I think Arizona and Seattle will be too tough to beat. Realistically I\u2019d settle at not being the division\u2019s whipping boys like last year. How head coach Chip Kelly organises the team this year will be a big factor. Can running back Carlos Hyde stay healthy and make an impact? Can wide receiver Torrey Smith make the step up? And the big question is what\u2019s going to happen at QB? There\u2019s a lot of questions about how the 49ers will play under a new coach, but there are reasons to hope the team is heading in the right direction. </p> <p>In terms of the furore surrounding Colin Kaepernick and his refusal to stand for the national anthem, I think it was a brave move. NFL stars are some of the most prominent black figures in the country so when a guy who should really keep his head down and try to get back in the team makes a stand, I think it says something. They need to keep the debate happening as role models and prominent figures. <strong><em>Andy Prentice</em></strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d9072a35822d5d3aee695cd10326864534ee6bd2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d9072a35822d5d3aee695cd10326864534ee6bd2/0_0_4896_3264/1000.jpg\" alt=\"San Francisco 49ers fans cheer during pre-season action against Houston Texans at Levi\u2019s Stadium.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">San Francisco 49ers fans cheer during pre-season action against Houston Texans at Levi\u2019s Stadium.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Cary Edmondson/USA Today Sports</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong><em>Seattle Seahawks </em></strong></h2> <p>So far the Hawks look like a Super Bowl team again this year. They have the talent, depth and the attitude, and the offensive line is starting to gel. There are no serious injuries to key players, and both running back Thomas Rawls and tight end Jimmy Graham are living up to the expectations we have for them. The defense just has to play like they have the last four years. That shouldn\u2019t be a problem. <strong><em>Bob C</em></strong></p> <p>With a mix of exciting fresh faces and healed key players, I\u2019m hoping for at least the playoffs again this season. The protection of quarterback Russell Wilson needs to be stepped up this season. If that pocket stays clear, I can see him passing the ball more like the end of last season. Seahawks are upping their game. Be aware! <strong><em>Robert Collins </em></strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4e6b584ef9467b4e2ea99aecedb55a91c2685763\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4e6b584ef9467b4e2ea99aecedb55a91c2685763/0_0_3384_2154/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Seattle Seahawks running back Thomas Rawls rushes against Pittsburgh Steelers at CenturyLink Field.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"637\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Seattle Seahawks running back Thomas Rawls rushes against Pittsburgh Steelers at CenturyLink Field.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Otto Greule Jr/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong><em>Tampa Bay Buccaneers</em></strong></h2> <p>I\u2019ve been a Tampa Bay fan since a visit to the Raymond James Stadium in 2012, so I have known only the dark times associated with following the Bucs. I would love to say my hopes for the season would be a second Lombardi, but the reality has to be respected and the best this young exciting team can hope for is an NFC Wild Card position. The Carolina Panthers are a sure fire bet to win the NFC South for the fourth successive year. </p> <p>For the first time in their history, the Bucs have a franchise quarterback in Jameis Winston and you should believe the hype. Add in the top tandem of running backs from last year\u2019s NFL in Doug Martin and Charles Sims, along with impressive big wide receivers in experienced Vincent Jackson and the youthful Mike Evans, you can understand why the Bucs ranked 5th overall on Offense last year. As far as Defense is concerned, the Bucs already had some quality pieces in defensive tackle Gerald McCoy and linebackers Lavonte David and Kwon Alexander. They can only get better with the addition of a genuine pass rush, something that has been sorely lacking in Tampa ever Simeon Rice left the building.</p> <p>Of course a new Head Coach in Dirk Koetter,last years offensive co-ordinator, brings a feeling of urgency to the front office and the hire of ex-Atlanta Falcons Head Coach Mike Smith should also bring more dynamic schemes to what is shaping up to be a greatly improved Defense especially against the pass. A Super Bowl in 2016? Maybe not. A Super Bowl before the decade is out? Maybe, Tampa, just maybe. <strong><em>Stuart Anderson </em></strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f7677ed4c29c5414915444331686c3524d5ef540\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f7677ed4c29c5414915444331686c3524d5ef540/0_0_3360_2601/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tampa Bay Buccaneers quarterback Jameis Winston throws a pass against the Cleveland Browns during the first quarter of an NFL football game Friday, Aug. 26, 2016, in Tampa, Fla.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"774\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tampa Bay Buccaneers quarterback Jameis Winston throws a pass against the Cleveland Browns during the first quarter of an NFL football game Friday, Aug. 26, 2016, in Tampa, Fla.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Chris O'Meara/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong><em>Tennessee Titans </em></strong></h2> <p>I\u2019m hoping to avoid a losing record, go 8-8 and finish 3rd in the AFC South, ahead of the Brock Osweiler led Texans. If we succeed we\u2019ll get there on a brutal running game and keeping our franchise quarterback healthy for all 16 games. We need better offense line play than last year. It would be hard to get worse to be honest. A competent receiver to step up and make some plays to reduce the pressure on tight end Delaine Walker and quarterback Marcus Mariota would also be welocme. <strong><em>David</em></strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"289b62a4f75991f23af4d3e29f970310bededdf9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/289b62a4f75991f23af4d3e29f970310bededdf9/0_0_3600_2400/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tennessee Titans quarterback Marcus Mariota during warm up prior to the game against the Carolina Panthers at Nissan Stadium.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tennessee Titans quarterback Marcus Mariota during warm up prior to the game against the Carolina Panthers at Nissan Stadium.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jim Brown/USA Today Sports</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong><em>Washington </em></strong></h2> <p>I expect the NFC East will be a very close division this year. Every team has question marks heading into the season. I think Washington will win the division, but possibly only with a 9-7 record. The key is the running game, which went AWOL last season. It heaped a lot of pressure onto the inexperienced shoulders of quarterback Kirk Cousins who did a superb job under the circumstances. He has some real weapons in the passing game and, if wide receiver Josh Doctson can stay fit, he\u2019ll be seeing a lot of the ball, as opponents tend to focus on DeSean Jackson and Pierre Garcon. They can all turn short receptions into long gains. </p> <p>The defense is certainly better, especially in the secondary, where the addition of Josh Norman is a significant upgrade. With Bashaud Breeland developing into a very good cornerback option, Quinton Dunbar also shaping up nicely, the Redskins should defend the pass much better. They need to defend the run better and, while the loss of linebacker Junior Gallette may yet hurt us, they have some depth which should help alleviate his loss. <strong><em>quicknstraight</em></strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1b3fa7c510316e7ce389293c841f2eb943e6848a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1b3fa7c510316e7ce389293c841f2eb943e6848a/0_0_2778_2012/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Washington quarterback Colt McCoy and wide receiver Rashad Ross celebrate connecting for a touchdown during the first half of an NFL pre-season game against New York Jets.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"724\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Washington quarterback Colt McCoy and wide receiver Rashad Ross celebrate connecting for a touchdown during the first half of an NFL pre-season game against New York Jets.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nick Wass/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>",

He added: \u201cI never experienced something like this, to have three retirements on the road to the semi-finals.\u201d Nor has the tournament.</p> <p>It should be pointed out the world No1 would have won all three matches that either didn\u2019t start or didn\u2019t finish in the regular way. But their curtailment has provided Djokovic with the almost perfect preparation for the final push: minimum exertion over nine sets of tennis in four matches while getting a feel for the court and conditions, especially in his night appearances.</p> <p>The final is scheduled to begin at 4pm local time on Sunday, so the heat of the day will probably be less intense and the ball will move to his liking on Arthur Ashe Court \u2013 especially so if the new roof is drawn across against the elements.</p> <p>All of these factors have to be computed alongside the injury problems that Djokovic has had to cope with since his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/jul/02/novak-djokovic-knocked-out-wimbledon-sam-querrey\" title=\"\">shock early exit from Wimbledon</a>.

The wrist injury arrived during the Olympics in Rio, he said, and Juan Mart\u00edn del Potro took full advantage to put Djokovic out in the first round. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/07/novak-djokovic-rio-2016-juan-martin-del-potro\" title=\"\">The loser wept on court</a>, clearly devastated after committing to the Olympics where others had been less enthusiastic.</p> <p>He then withdrew from the Cincinnati Open and there appeared to be a problem with his right elbow.

He is doing what he does at nearly all slams: growing into his proper stature after a brief period of vulnerability.&#xa0;In normal circumstances, then, Djokovic would be considered a strong favourite to beat the brilliant if erratic Monfils \u2013 except the Frenchman is not playing to stereotype here. He is as crazily athletic as ever, but there is solidity in his game that often has been missing. His game-face is serious and determined, where once there was a playful, carefree mien.</p> <p>Monfils has had a good season, perhaps his best in terms of performance. As Djokovic observed after Monfils <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2016/sep/06/lucas-pouille-gael-monfils-us-open-mens-quarter-final-live\" title=\"\">destroyed his compatriot Lucas Pouille in three sets </a>in the first quarter-final: \u201cHe seems more focused at this time of his career.\u201d</p> <p>But can he beat Djokovic? Logic says the gap of 12 places between them in the rankings is not there by accident. Nor is it wise to ignore the other 12 factor: the number of defeats Djokovic has inflicted on Monfils in their 12 encounters. That is total dominance.</p> <p>Yet, as much as sport is all about the numbers, romance and unpredictability \u2013 qualities with which Monfils has always been associated \u2013 can come into play at any time. Djokovic will be alert to the danger of an upset and Monfils will be committed to it.</p> <p>\u201cI thought that I came out with the right intensity,\u201d Djokovic said of his aborted match against Tsonga. \u201cThe quality of my game and level of performance has raised in the last couple of days, which obviously encourages me prior to the last four.</p> <p>\u201cI put myself in a position again to be one match away from the finals. As the tournament progresses, I feel like I\u2019m getting better. This grand slam is unique for me.\u201d</p> <p>Monfils, who turned 30 last week, is keeping his charisma and his jokes in check for now. \u201cI missed a good chance two years ago against Roger [Federer],\u201d he said of making his first semi-final here. \u201cBut, you know, I just live now, and now I\u2019m happy.

All of these creatures have been updated to critically endangered status this year, yet I suspect this is the first time you will have heard of them. It certainly was for me, writing this article.</p> <p>These are animals worthy of having a look at, surely, so I am delighted to be able to share them with you. Might I encourage you (anyone?) to check out the <a href=\"http://www.iucnredlist.org/details/14870997/0\" title=\"\">epirus dancing grasshopper</a> or the <a href=\"http://www.iucnredlist.org/details/21215168/0\" title=\"\">variable cuckoo bumblebee</a>?

Many of you won\u2019t care about organisms such as these, and that\u2019s OK. Hell, these are organisms so uninspiring (to some) that they have been given interesting names like \u201c<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometric_tortoise\" title=\"\">the geometric tortoise</a>\u201d to gee up the international interest. Yet they are all critically endangered, as of this year.</p> <p>These are animals about which we rarely speak when it comes to conservation. They lack the appeal, somehow. They are less interesting. Less worthy of our concern, maybe. They\u2019re just not mammals.</p> <p>There is a word for what we\u2019re talking about here. It is speciesism. Speciesism like this is by no means a new phenomenon, particularly when it comes to the conservation of invertebrates. In Britain, for instance, we spend far <a href=\"https://www.buglife.org.uk/blog/matt-shardlow-ceo/it-%E2%80%98cos-i-small\" title=\"\">less money on conserving such creatures compared to bony animals</a> and, globally, we spend far less time researching their conservation. It\u2019s no wonder they barely get a look in during coverage of the IUCN\u2019s annual red list updates.</p> <p>So are we human beings committing a form of animal racism when it comes to global conservation? Undeniably, I think the answer is yes. But a different question might be: does a bit of speciesism really matter, when it comes to conservation?</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/sep/04/eastern-gorilla-critically-endangered-illegal-hunting-iucn-red-list\">Eastern gorilla now critically endangered while giant panda situation improves</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The common argument for speciesism is that saving bamboo forests for pandas or saving rainforests for orangutans benefits a whole host of invertebrate species and helps conserve hundreds of overlooked geckos and snakes on the side. (Essentially, the argument goes, saving the A-listers also saves the production staff and the catering crew). This might be true. But the problem with accepting this worldview is that it does little to change attitudes, and this is something that frustrates me immensely as someone with an interest in such creatures.</p> <p>You can roll your eyes at this, of course, but accepting speciesism is short-sighted and damaging in the long-term. It is like marketing a library as a place to read airport novels; it downplays and cheapens the wealth of material there to study and marvel at. Invertebrates and newts and tortoises and fungi offer us new perspectives on the human experience and keep open the windows of potential to learn new things that one day might be good for us, even if they don\u2019t seem much use right now. Biodiversity is about more than just biology. It\u2019s really a story of diversity. Of shared ancestors. Of shared branches.</p> <p>So let\u2019s celebrate, if we can, the conservation of all species and focus our minds further across the tree of life. Fungi, newts, dancing grasshoppers and mountain crayfish \u2013 the unspoken nature of their downward spiral probably says more about what it is to be human than we care to consider. But that doesn\u2019t mean we shouldn\u2019t be ready to change.</p>",

  "<p>On 15 August 1975, the Indian government hosted a lavish party. It had good reason to celebrate: not only was it marking 28 years of independence from British rule, but the prime minister, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/1984/nov/01/india.guardianobituaries\" title=\"\">Indira Gandhi</a>, had declared the date \u201cIndependence from Smallpox Day\u201d. For decades, India was considered the endemic home of the disease, accounting for some 60% of globally reported cases. Yet in the space of just one year, infections had fallen from 188,000 to zero, thanks to a combination of disease surveillance, vaccination and publicity.</p> <p>Yet as <a href=\"http://www.who.int/bulletin/volumes/86/12/08-041208/en/\" title=\"\">Donald Henderson</a>, head of the World Health Organisation\u2019s (WHO) global smallpox eradication programme, who has died aged 87, left the celebrations in order to catch a flight to Bangladesh, he received word that the borders were closed. The Bangladeshi military had staged a coup; the president and his family were dead.</p> <p>It was a pivotal moment in the global effort to eradicate smallpox, a disease that had until recently killed some 2 million people each year. To get this far, Henderson and his team had overcome political resistance, ineffective vaccine stocks, floods, famine and civil war. They had stopped cars in the streets of the former Yugoslavia to vaccinate people, and gone house to house in remote regions of India to nip outbreaks in the bud. Now, eight years into the campaign, Bangladesh was the final refuge for <em>Variola major</em>, the most infectious form of the virus, and the country was threatening to fall apart.</p> <p>Fearing that a tide of refugees might trigger fresh outbreaks, or even reimport the disease to India, Henderson deployed large numbers of health workers to the border to step up surveillance, and vaccinate as required. Fortunately, the predicted influx never arrived. A few weeks later, the borders reopened and WHO\u2019s teams went back to work. In November 1975, Bangladesh reported its final case of smallpox and, two years later, the world\u2019s last case was identified in <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2013/07/31/206947581/last-person-to-get-smallpox-dedicated-his-life-to-ending-polio\" title=\"\">Ali Maow Maalin</a> \u2013 a Somali cook from the port city of Merca. The world was finally declared smallpox-free in 1979.</p> <p>Despite our best efforts, smallpox remains the only human disease to have been completely eradicated from the planet. \u201cIf the Nobel prize in medicine was not so focused on basic science, Henderson and the smallpox team would surely have shared it,\u201d said Chris Beyrer, Desmond Tutu professor of public health and human rights at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health in Baltimore. \u201cThe eradication of that ancient, disfiguring and often fatal viral scourge is surely one of the single greatest triumphs of public health in human history.\u201d</p> <p>Known as \u201cDA\u201d to many, Donald Ainslie Henderson was born in Lakewood, Ohio, the son of David, an engineer, and Eleanor (nee McMillan), a nurse. He graduated from Oberlin College in Ohio in 1950, which is where he met his future wife, Nana Bragg, whom he married the following year. After obtaining a medical degree from the University of Rochester in 1954, Henderson started a residency at a hospital in Cooperstown, New York, but was then required to do two years of military service. Fearing that as a newly qualified physician he would spend his time conducting relatively mundane assessments of new recruits, he instead opted to join the US Epidemic Intelligence Service \u2013 a boots-on-the-ground disease detective unit at the then Center for Communicable Diseases (CDC), responsible for identifying the source of outbreaks and clearing them up.</p> <p>In 1961, Henderson became chief of the surveillance section at the CDC, and established a smallpox surveillance unit in 1962. It was the beginning of a relationship with smallpox that would come to dominate his life.</p> <p>In 1966, the World Health Assembly narrowly voted in favour of undertaking a global eradication campaign for smallpox. When Henderson was approached about leading it, he was initially reluctant: he had only recently been given the green light for a smallpox eradication and measles control programme in west and central Africa which he would lead, and the $2.7m allocated for global eradication was not even enough to buy the required vaccine. The prospects of success seemed doubtful, and many \u2013 including the director general of the World Health Assembly \u2013 expected it to fail.</p> <p>Nevertheless, Henderson accepted the challenge, and moved his family to Geneva to work at WHO headquarters. Having already worked on plans to eradicate smallpox from parts of Africa, Henderson believed that trying to vaccinate everyone against the disease was futile; there wasn\u2019t enough funding nor, as he soon discovered, enough effective vaccine \u2013 quality control tests revealed that just 10% of available vaccine actually protected against smallpox.</p> <p>Instead Henderson focused on surveillance and containment. Understanding that smallpox spreads like wildfire, he asked every health centre and hospital to produce a weekly report; as soon as a case of smallpox was identified, a team was dispatched to identify and vaccinate everyone that that person had been in contact with, and their contacts. He also insisted that everyone regularly rotated through the field, regardless of their seniority. \u201cNo one was allowed to dictate policy from Geneva or Washington who was not out regularly in the field and engaged in the actual work of the effort,\u201d Beyrer recalled.</p> <p>Henderson himself regularly visited smallpox-affected countries and filed detailed progress reports, although he primarily viewed his role as a catalyst: it was the countries themselves that defeated smallpox.</p> <p>Even then, as Henderson often pointed out, they barely succeeded \u2013 and he was sceptical about the potential for ridding the world of other diseases. Three months after the world was declared smallpox-free, Henderson was asked to address a meeting convened to decide which disease should be eradicated next. He said he didn\u2019t think there was any candidate disease. Smallpox was unique in that it was always transmitted person-to-person; you could easily identify who had the disease and who had been successfully vaccinated against it; and there was an effective, heat-stable vaccine that worked even after someone had been exposed to the disease.</p> <p>With smallpox all but gone, Henderson accepted a position as dean of Johns Hopkins School of Hygiene and Public Health (now Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health) in 1977, although his relationship with the virus continued; he later worked to contain stocks of smallpox in laboratories worldwide, and served as director of the US Office of Public Health Emergency Preparedness in the wake of the September 11 attacks, which involved guarding against the possibility of smallpox being used as a biological weapon.</p> <p>However, he considered his greatest achievement to be establishing the base and impetus for the WHO\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.who.int/immunization/programmes_systems/supply_chain/benefits_of_immunization/en/\" title=\"\">expanded programme on immunisation</a>, the goal of which is to provide universal access to all relevant vaccines for all at risk. \u201cI believe that the important, longer-term contribution of smallpox eradication ... was its demonstration of how much could be accomplished with how little in the control of infectious diseases through community-wide vaccination programmes,\u201d he wrote in his autobiography, Smallpox \u2013 the Death of a Disease (2009).</p> <p>Henderson is survived by Nana, their daughter, Leigh, and two sons, David and Douglas.</p> <p>\u2022 Donald Ainslie Henderson, epidemiologist, born 7 September 1928; died 19 August 2016</p>",
  "<h2>1. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMvSSLZPC9w\">Diamond Head \u2013 Am I Evil?</a></h2> <p>If there\u2019s a single song that epitomises the new wave of British heavy metal, it\u2019s this one, even though <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u-HCHCuHMg\">Metallica\u2019s cover</a> is probably better known nowadays than the original (Metallica\u2019s drummer, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/video/2013/oct/09/metallica-drummer-lars-ulrich-film-through-the-never-video\">Lars Ulrich</a>, travelled to London from Denmark to see Diamond Head in 1981; on moving to California, his small ad seeking musicians to form a band cited Diamond Head and Tygers of Pan Tang and Iron Maiden as role models). Diamond Head were once touted as the second coming of Led Zeppelin \u2013 and this song was described as having more riffs than the first four Black Sabbath albums. They should have been huge but failed because of bad timing and bad management, as well as more practical details such as the entire pressing of their \u201cdifficult second album\u201d being unplayable because of manufacturing faults. But this monumental song remains their enduring legacy.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbgv587ooNM\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"345\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/mbgv587ooNM?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <h2>2. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDNnobC49AA\">Tygers of Pan Tang \u2013 Don\u2019t Stop By</a></h2> <p>Metal doesn\u2019t really do difficult second albums (unless you were in Diamond Head) and indeed NWOBHM threw up quite a few bands whose second album was their best. The Tygers of Pan Tang, taking their name from one of Michael Moorcock\u2019s novels, were one such band, bolstered by a change of singer and the addition of guitar wizard John Sykes, later of Thin Lizzy and Whitesnake. This song represents the more commercial side of the band\u2019s much, chosen because of John Sykes\u2019 amazingly fluid solo. It shows why he went on to bigger and better things, and why the band faded away once he left.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2009/jan/02/saxon-rock-music\">Roy Wilkinson on the new wave of British heavy metal 30 years on</a> </p> </aside>  <h2>3. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXH_9707PLc\">Angel Witch \u2013 Angel Witch</a></h2> <p>Angel Witch were perhaps too far ahead of their time in the early 1980s: for years they were best known as the answer to the quiz question: \u201cWhich band has spent the least time on the singles charts?\u201d (Their 1980 single Sweet Danger spent a single week at No 75, the bottom slot). Though they were sometimes dismissed as a poor man\u2019s Black Sabbath, their music hinted at a potential that was never realised. They did, however, foretell the direction metal would take in future decades, especially on songs like <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm6LSTcVL3c\">Angel of Death</a>. But it\u2019s the title track of their eponymous album that\u2019s remembered the best. At Reading festival in 1983, the between-bands DJ had the entire audience singing the chorus. As one of the band later remarked, had that many people had actually bought the record, it would have been far more of a hit than it was.</p> <h2>4. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dg5dkJAGSM\">Def Leppard \u2013 Getcha Rocks Off</a></h2> <p>Nowadays we think of Def Leppard as an AOR band with a sound airbrushed for American radio by Robert John \u201cMutt\u201d Lange on the albums Pyromania and Hysteria. It\u2019s as if they had the same sort of relationship with metal as Blondie had with punk. But they didn\u2019t start out like that, and their debut single on their own label, Bludgeon Riffola, helped kickstart the whole NWOBHM movement. This raucous twin-guitar gallop is an ocean away from <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UIB9Y4OFPs\">Pour Some Sugar on Me</a>, and sounds like the product of working-class Sheffield rather than something out of LA.</p> <h2>5. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5TJuQo2fhk\">Demon \u2013 Father of Time</a></h2> <p>The NWOBHM label covered many different styles within the broad spectrum of hard rock. For every band who hinted at the more aggressive sounds that would come to define metal in later decades, there was another who had evolved from the more melodic sounds of the previous one. Demon fell into the latter category, with the soaring guitars and bluesy vocals of Dave Hill, but their reliance on Hammer Horror occult lyrical themes was more than enough to put them firmly in the metal camp.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLNVnmq9Tpv3r63rRXWoopOVdPARcvdSLC\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"345\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/videoseries?wmode=opaque&list=PLNVnmq9Tpv3r63rRXWoopOVdPARcvdSLC\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>Our New Wave of British Heavy Metal playlist on YouTube</figcaption> </figure>   <h2>6. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h8IuFl3sMhk\">Iron Maiden \u2013 Phantom of the Opera</a></h2> <p>Iron Maiden were one of the few NWOBHM bands who managed to achieve escape velocity by the time the scene faded away in the early 80s, and fill arenas and stadiums around the world to this day. But in the early days, with original singer Paul Di\u2019Anno, they were a different beast from the polished metal machine they are today, with a rawer, almost punky element to their sound (though in the TV series Metal Evolution, band mastermind Steve Harris denied any affinity for punk). If you don\u2019t already know the song, you might recognise the intro from the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBetudbtRto#t=3s\">Lucozade advert</a> featuring Daley Thompson. If there was a punk element to their sound, there was also a prog rock side, too \u2013 which is still present in their music \u2013 as shown by the complex middle section. </p> <h2>7. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYNWo93fPG8\">Girlschool \u2013 C\u2019Mon Let\u2019s Go</a></h2> <p>Nowadays we\u2019re used to women in metal bands, with hordes of Scandinavian symphonic metal bands fronted by opera-trained sopranos. Back in the early 80s, though, an all-girl band playing metal with a punk attitude were pioneers, and metal fans of the day warmly accepted them as part of the gang. Though they are best known for <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYFwN-l46r8\">their link-up with Mot\u00f6rhead</a> for the St Valentine\u2019s Day Massacre EP, they deserve their place here in their own right: they epitomised metal\u2019s ambivalent relationship with punk; taking punk\u2019s aggression and can-do attitude while rejecting the genre\u2019s lack of musicality.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYNWo93fPG8\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"345\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/BYNWo93fPG8?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <h2>8. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCSkjYE5-So\">Samson \u2013 Vice Versa</a></h2> <p>Before he jumped ship and became the voice of Iron Maiden for their imperial phase, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/sep/06/bruce-dickinson-interview-iron-maiden\">Bruce Dickinson</a> used to go by the name of Bruce Bruce and fronted Samson, a band initially known for their masked drummer Thunderstick, who used to <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7I6xfEIqrY\">perform in a cage</a>.

  "<p>\u201cNo one in his right mind,\u201d Joe Sutter told Air &amp; Space magazine in 2007, \u201cwould want to get into this business.\u201d Fortunately for commercial aviation, Sutter, who has died aged 95, was a man afflicted by a particularly beneficial form of wrong-headedness, since he was the aeronautical engineer identified as the \u201cfather\u201d of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jan/23/boeings-747-production-scaled-back-airbus\">Boeing 747</a> jumbo jet. This was the airliner which, from its first flight on 9 February 1969, ushered in the second age of civil jet aviation, focusing on mass transit.</p> <p>\u201cYou bet the company,\u201d Sutter had added, \u201ceach time you do a new project.\u201d This was never more true than with the 747, where the engineer managed the design team \u2013 the \u201cIncredibles\u201d \u2013 who put the project together in 28 months. \u201cIt was,\u201d he <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b03wtnfv\">told the BBC</a> in 2015, \u201ca fight all the way.\u201d</p> <p>It took in the construction of the largest building in the world to house the new aircraft, major cash flow issues and successfully overcoming the Pratt &amp; Whitney JT9D engines\u2019 unfortunate tendency to catch fire. A tough negotiator, Sutter also assumed, wrongly, that he would lose his job in 1967 after successfully resisting demands that he sack 1,000 of his 4,500 engineers. To cap all this, there was also the illusory challenge of the Anglo-French <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/concorde\">Concorde</a>, and the 747\u2019s initial status as the poor relation to the Boeing 2707 Mach 3 airliner, which was finally abandoned in 1971.</p> <p>The 747 was born in 1965 when Juan Trippe, the boss of Pan American, told Boeing that his airline wanted a huge new double-decker passenger aircraft. What he got, and eventually agreed to, was the wide-bodied 747, with its 20ft cabin width and space for 400-plus passengers; earlier jet airliners had peaked with a capacity of fewer than 200.</p> <p>In spring 1966, Trippe made an initial order of 25 aircraft, and on 22 January 1970 the first Pan Am scheduled flight, from New York to London, touched down \u2013 six hours late; the original aircraft had developed engine trouble and a substitute plane had had to be found. The Guardian\u2019s headline was \u201cAnother fit of stumbles for Jumbo\u201d. But the stumbles faded, and the 747, instantly recognisable, went on to redefine air travel, with no comparable rival emerging until the European Airbus A380 in 2005.</p> <p>Before the epic of the 747, Sutter worked on a series of Boeing passenger planes that established the company in a dominant position in commercial aviation from the late 1950s onwards. He was an aerodynamist on the 707, the second jet on the transatlantic route (following fleeting competition from the British Comet 4), and he significantly affected the wing design on the short and medium haul 727 launched in the early 1960s. And he won his first patent on the short and medium haul 737, which first flew in 1967, is still in production now and, with more than 9,000 sales, is the most popular jet airliner in the world.</p> <p>Sutter was born and raised in a Catholic family in Seattle, Washington state. His father, Frank (originally Franc Suhadolc), was a Slovenian immigrant who had come to North America as a Klondike gold prospector and became a meat cutter, while his mother, Rose (nee Plesik) was born in Austria-Hungary. Sutter grew up in the Beacon Hill district of Seattle and was educated at Cleveland high school in the city. A model plane builder in childhood, Sutter found student summer work at the Boeing Plant 2, while an undergraduate at the University of Washington.</p> <p>William Boeing had set up his original company in 1916 and in the immediate period after the first world war it had focused on commercial aviation. But it was the military/civil interplay to come that was key to the company\u2019s success. In the later interwar years, when Sutter was in his teens, Boeing was also developing the B17 four-engined bomber, which would provide the backbone of the US Army Air Forces\u2019 war over Germany. By the end of the 1930s the company was also beginning tentative work on the B29 bomber which, in 1945, launched the two atomic attacks on Japan.</p> <p>In 1943 Sutter graduated with a degree in aeronautical engineering and then did war service on a US Navy destroyer in the Pacific. Demobbed, in 1946 he accepted a job in California with Douglas Aircraft, which then enjoyed a lead in the field of commercial aircraft. Later, back in Seattle, he took on a temporary post at Boeing \u2013 it would last 40 years.

This, in its turn, had been developed from the B29 bomber.

  "<p>The prime minister, Theresa May, has claimed that the government has met a promise to replace properties sold through the right-to-buy scheme on a one-to-one basis.</p> <p>Her claim was made in response to a question from the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, who suggested that only one home was being built for every five sold through the scheme.</p> <p>Right to buy was started by the Conservative government in the early 1980s and allowed tenants in council-owned properties to purchase their home at a discount to the market value. Since then, about 2m properties have moved into the private sector, and the proportion of homes in England that are social housing has fallen from 31% to 17%.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2012/apr/03/cameron-right-to-buy-housing\">In 2012, David Cameron relaunched the scheme</a>, increasing the discounts available to tenants. In London tenants now get discounts of up to \u00a3103,900, while those outside the capital can buy at up to \u00a377,900 below market price. At the same time the government pledged to replace all homes sold under the new policy.</p> <p>Since the relaunch, sales have picked up again. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2016/mar/24/right-to-buy-homes-sold-england-councils\">Between April 2012 and the end of 2015, there were 49,573 right-to-buy sales</a>. </p> <p><strong>Have those homes been replaced?</strong></p> <p>No. Over that same period 4,594 new homes were started on site or acquired by councils. So just one in 10 of the sold-off properties were replaced.</p> <p>Focusing just on the additional homes sold as a result of the reinvigorated policy makes the picture look slightly better for the government \u2013 and May could have been talking about that. But even then, all the extra homes sold have not been replaced or even started.<br></p> <p>The government says that in the first year of the new policy there were 3,054 additional sales out of the total of 5,944. At the same time there were 473 housing starts and acquisitions in England. </p> <p>However, councils are given three years to start replacements. They do not even have to start on the foundations for properties sold last year, meaning it is near impossible to work out if the promise is being met.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/533503/Right_to_Buy_sales_in_England_2015_to_2016_quarter_4.pdf\">In its most recent release on right-to-buy sales, the Department for Communities and Local Government</a> said: \u201cUnder the right-to-buy one-for-one additions policy, local authorities have three years from the date of the sale of each additional home to provide an additional affordable property. </p> <p>\u201cThere were 3,054 additional sales between 2012-13 Q1 and 2012-13 Q4. There have been 5,239 starts and acquisitions delivered by local authorities between 2012-13 Q1 and 2015- 16 Q4, exceeding the target for one-for-one additions.\u201d </p> <p>Added to these are 1,287 starts by other agencies, which gives 6,526 in total the department added. </p> <p>But that means counting three years\u2019 of building against one year of losses. </p> <p>Building has picked up, but does not seem on track to meet the increase in sales since the discounts were added. In a paper published this year, the<a href=\"http://www.insidehousing.co.uk/nao-issues-warning-on-right-to-buy-replacements/7014414.article\"> National Audit Office found that starts on new homes will have to rise five-fold by the end of 2017/18</a> for the 8,512 homes sold off in 2014/15 to be replaced.</p> <p>That seems unlikely: analysis recently published by the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/aug/11/right-to-buy-reform-urged-as-council-leaders-fear-for-social-housing\">Local Government Association showed that the replacement trend was downwards \u2013 building by councils had fallen by more than a quarter in the last financial year.</a></p> <p>So the homes sold have not yet been replaced, and there are warnings that they will not be. </p>",
  "<p>It was my turn to introduce myself. \u201cMy son Alex Henry was wrongfully convicted of murder by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2016/feb/18/joint-enterprise-law-what-why-controversial\" title=\"\">joint enterprise</a>.

When the verdict was announced at the Old Bailey, and we realised that our sons had been found guilty of murder, it was a traumatic shock. Everything sounded muffled; I kept repeating to my <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/feb/18/brother-19-years-jail-joint-enterprise-conviction-law\" title=\"\">daughter Charlotte</a> over and over again: \u201cWhat did they say?\u201d Yet I had heard, because I could hear my own wailing, and feel my pulse in my ears as sobs shook my body. It felt like I was drowning and falling, I could not move, could not breathe . And then I felt the hands of the security guards as they tried to remove me. I could hear screams of agony: \u201cDon\u2019t take my baby, don\u2019t take my baby\u201d as Barbara fell to the ground, the shock so bad that an ambulance had to be called.</p> <p>That was two years ago, and I am still horrified by the injustice. This week campaigners at JENGbA began to see the result of a long, hard fight to reform the doctrine of joint enterprise.</p> <p>The grassroots of JENGbA started with four angry women. We now support 650 Joint Enterprise prisoners aged 13 and up, mostly from black and minority ethnic backgrounds. There are approximately 4,500 men, women and children serving long sentences, usually life, for crimes they didn\u2019t commit, and are languishing in prison with no hope of early parole.</p> <p>In February this year, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2016/feb/18/joint-enterprise-law-wrongly-interpreted-for-30-years-court-rules\" title=\"\">supreme court ruled that</a> for the last 30 years our justice system had got it wrong on joint enterprise. <a href=\"http://www.leicestermercury.co.uk/pair-guilty-murdering-leicestershire-pc-paul-fyfe/story-15654871-detail/story.html\" title=\"\">Ameen Hassan Jogee</a> was convicted of murder even though it was his friend who stabbed the victim, and the supreme court\u2019s decision led to a retrial. Through the sheer determination of his mother and his QC, Jogee was found not guilty of murder earlier this week. A manslaughter convicted was reinstated in its place.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>But will further miscarriages of justice be prevented? The supreme court ruled the evidential bar had been set too low</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>We will see more results of further appeals in due course. But will further miscarriages of justice be prevented? The supreme court ruled that the evidential bar for guilt had been set too low in joint enterprise cases. It had convicted bystanders (secondary offenders) based on whether the jury was convinced that this person \u201cforesaw\u201d that the killer (primary defendant) might commit the act.</p> <p>However, the evidence for the foresight element has always been based on inferences \u2013 that is, friendship and often mere presence. The prosecution could use the friendship between codefendants to insinuate a meeting of minds ,creating a slippery slope from being a witness to having a guilty mind.</p> <p>Now the prosecution must prove that the defendant intentionally assisted or encouraged the person to commit the act. But in the absence of a definition for what constitutes assisting and encouraging, the evidential bar remains low.</p> <p>And so the risk is that joint enterprise remains a dragnet; whether that is for manslaughter rather than murder remains to be seen. It captures the guilty and innocent alike. Not just to criminalise ethnic minorities, but also to rid our streets of young people who are vulnerable, with mental heath problems, developmental and learning disabilities (like Alex, who has autism) and in some cases physical impairments (like <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2016/feb/20/mother-hopes-joint-enterprise-verdict-will-overturn-sons-conviction\" title=\"\">Jordan Cuncliffe, who was imprisoned</a> for a murder committed by someone else when he was aged 15, despite being blind).</p> <p>Unsurprisingly, many prisoners convicted by joint enterprise maintain their innocence and refuse to show remorse for a crime they did not commit. For some, this means they do not progress from category A prisons to category B \u2013 and for many there is the threat of delayed parole.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2016/feb/18/joint-enterprise-law-wrongly-interpreted-for-30-years-court-rules\">Joint enterprise law wrongly interpreted for 30 years, court rules</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The change in the law means we are now faced with the prospect of further injustice as prisoners who are able to appeal under the Jogee judgment may be faced with a dilemma: Accept a charge of manslaughter or continue to maintain your innocence. Prisoners are desperate to return home to their loved ones, but balk at the idea of admitting to something you didn\u2019t do.</p> <p>Alex is 23 now and has been imprisoned for three years. He is a vulnerable adult in a category-A prison; and, of course, he is still my baby. Like people in many other cases, he will be requesting permission to appeal soon, and we hope he will finally get a fair trial. There is more work to be done to ensure justice prevails, as it has for Ameen Jogee, whose mother did not stop fighting for him.

  "<h2>The crisis in America\u2019s public defender system</h2> <p>Ed Monahan, Kentucky\u2019s public advocate and chief defender, describes public defenders as \u201cthe pack mules of the system\u201d. Current statistics are hard to come by, but a 2008 study by the American Bar Association estimated that just 2.5% of the roughly $200bn spent on criminal justice by states and local government every year went on public defenders. Up to 90% of criminal defendants in the US qualify as indigent, and some public defenders are working 150 cases with a budget of just $350 for each. No wonder, then, if the scales of justice tilt against poor peopel. \u201cPack mules can carry a lot. But you put one more box on an overburdened mule, and it won\u2019t be able to function,\u201d says Monahan.

  "<h2>Why is a $25,000 campaign donation Donald Trump made in September 2013 to Pam Bondi, a Republican running for re-election as Florida\u2019s attorney general, now such a big deal?</h2> <p>Trump circumvented Internal Revenue Service (IRS) rules by routing the money through a charitable entity, the Donald J Trump Foundation, which is prohibited by law from making political donations. More controversially, however, Bondi\u2019s office was at the time mulling whether to join a New York state probe into allegations that customers who paid thousands of dollars to Trump University, Trump\u2019s for-profit education company, for a real estate investment course were ripped off. Just days after Trump\u2019s donation arrived, Bondi dropped her investigation into the alleged fraud, citing \u201cinsufficient grounds\u201d to proceed. </p> <h2>The donation was three years ago. Why is the case back in the news now?</h2> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/06/donald-trump-rally-greenville-north-carolina-clinton-attack\">Donald Trump fires up crowd with attack on Clinton's 'disqualifying conduct'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The story gained some traction in June when the <a href=\"http://bigstory.ap.org/article/e16a8223c24048d290883370dc6abe5b/florida-ag-asked-trump-donation-nixing-fraud-case\">Associated Press reported</a> that Bondi had personally solicited the donation from Trump to a political group supporting her re-election campaign. But last week\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2016/09/01/trump-pays-irs-a-penalty-for-his-foundation-violating-rules-with-gift-to-florida-attorney-general/\">Washington Post report</a> that Trump had paid the IRS a $2,500 penalty for the \u201cimproper\u201d contribution sparked renewed scrutiny, quickly followed by a <a href=\"http://talkingpointsmemo.com/livewire/pam-bondi-trump-never-spoke-clarification\">\u201che-said, she-said\u201d disagreement</a> this week over whether Trump and Bondi had ever actually discussed the affair. </p> <h2>So if Trump paid the IRS a penalty, does he admit he did wrong?</h2> <p>Not at all. The fact that Trump\u2019s charity made the unlawful donation instead of Trump himself was \u201cjust an honest mistake\u201d <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2016/09/01/trump-pays-irs-a-penalty-for-his-foundation-violating-rules-with-gift-to-florida-attorney-general/\">according to Jeffrey McConney</a>, senior vice-president of the Trump Organization. So, apparently, was the fact that the Trump Foundation\u2019s tax filing for that year did not record the donation to Bondi\u2019s group, but did claim that a $25,000 gift was made to a charity in Kansas with a similar-sounding name, even though no such donation appears to have been made. In the words of the Washington Post, \u201cthe prohibited gift was, in effect, replaced with an innocent sounding but non-existent donation\u201d.</p> <p>That\u2019s nonsense, insists McConney, who said Trump immediately reimbursed his foundation and filed corrected paperwork with the IRS as soon as the \u201cerrors\u201d were brought to his attention in March by the Post and the watchdog group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington.</p> <h2>And what of Bondi? Is she also contrite?</h2> <p>Despite flak from several Florida newspapers and the suggestion from the Miami Herald that she was <a href=\"http://www.miamiherald.com/opinion/editorials/article82634527.html\">\u201cbought and paid for\u201d</a>, the state\u2019s abrasive attorney general \u2013 who has publicly endorsed Trump for president \u2013 remains defiant. Having always insisted her office never formally investigated Trump University, and found no basis to do so, Bondi was forced on to the defensive on Tuesday after Hillary Clinton <a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/hillary-clinton-pam-bondi-donald-trump-2016-9\">spoke to reporters about the controversy</a>. \u201cI will not be collateral damage in a presidential campaign, nor will I be a woman bullied by Hillary Clinton,\u201d Bondi <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.foxbusiness.com/politics/2016/09/06/florida-ag-bondi-wont-be-bullied-by-hillary-clinton.html\">told Fox Business Network</a>.</p> <h2>So has the scandal run its course?</h2> <p>Unlikely.

The new revelation raises further questions over whether Trump was thanking Bondi, and could weaken his own line of attack against Clinton over the sourcing of her own campaign donations.</p>",

In 2014, the German government paid just under \u20ac1m for a previous \u2013 and much smaller \u2013 Mossack Fonseca leak. This led to a series of raids on those customers of Commerzbank, Germany\u2019s second largest bank, whom the authorities suspected of tax evasion. </p> <p>In 2006-07, Herv\u00e9 Falciani took data from inside HSBC\u2019s Swiss subsidiary. It showed how HSBC helped wealthy customers dodge tax. After fleeing to France, Falciani gave the HSBC files to French authorities. They shared them with other countries, including the UK. In January, British tax authorities <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jan/13/hmrc-admits-to-winding-up-inquiry-into-hsbc-tax-evasion-claims\">admitted they had not prosecuted</a> anybody.</p> <h2>Will other countries buy the data?</h2> <p>Probably. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2016/sep/07/panama-papers-denmark-becomes-first-country-to-buy-leaked-data\">Denmark\u2019s tax minister</a>, Karsten Lauritzen, says another government put him in touch with the anonymous source. This means the source has approached at least one other tax authority. Germany is a likely candidate. In the past, several EU countries, including Belgium, have taken a tough approach to tax offenders. David Cameron did hold an anti-corruption summit in London following the Panama Papers revelations, but the UK has generally been reluctant to pursue offenders or investigate offshore leaks. It has so far not questioned employees at Mossack Fonseca\u2019s UK office. The firm has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/may/28/mossack-fonseca-to-close-offices-in-jersey-gibraltar-and-isle-of-man\">closed branches in Jersey and the Isle of Man</a>. </p>",
  "<p>Former Conservative universities minister Lord Willetts has spoken out against Theresa May\u2019s plan to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/sep/06/grammar-schools-government-will-publish-plan-end-ban-weeks\">lift the ban on new grammar schools</a>, underlining the opposition she is likely to face within her own party.</p> <p>Willetts, who is now the chair of thinktank the Resolution Foundation, said he had not changed his views since the Conservatives were in opposition, and the evidence suggested they failed to help disadvantaged children.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid that was the evidence then and it still is the evidence,\u201d he told the Today programme.</p> <p>May is thought to be preparing to announce an expansion of selective schooling as early as next week, to please Tory grassroots members and set out a clear dividing line with Labour.</p> <p>But the move is also likely to expose divisions within her own party, with Conservative modernisers, many of whom were consigned to the backbenches in the sweeping reshuffle when May arrived in Downing Street, preparing to voice their concerns about the policy.</p> <p>Some details of Whitehall discussions about grammars were revealed on Tuesday when an education department official entered Downing Street with a note that was captured by a watching photographer.</p> <p>It referred to a \u201ccon doc\u201d, or consultation document, which education officials are thought to have been working on over the summer.</p> <p>The new education secretary, Justine Greening, who attended a comprehensive school, was revealed by the note to prefer the expansion of grammars to be one option among several proposed in the paper. Concerns were also raised about the problems of getting legislation on the issue through the House of Lords.</p> <p>When the then education secretary, Nicky Morgan, published a white paper in the spring on proposals for improving education outcomes in underperforming areas \u2013 which led to a row about the expansion of academies \u2013 grammars were not on the list of proposals.</p> <p>Proposals could include forcing any new grammars to boost the number of children they take from deprived backgrounds \u2013 who are often underrepresented within the existing grammar system, a situation which persists in some parts of the UK, including Kent, which has a number of grammar schools.</p> <p>Willetts said: \u201cIf you look overall, not just in Britain but around the world, at those school systems we admire that have got high performance and high standards, from Shanghai to Finland, by and large they don\u2019t put their effort into trying to pick which kids they educate; they put their effort into raising standards for all the kids.\u201d</p> <p>He added: \u201cWhen it comes to the best education policies we should look at the evidence and we\u2019ve got some very good evidence close to home: look at the transformation of schools in London. Those are really tough areas in London where they\u2019re actually achieving higher educational standards than in Kent and without selection.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>War-torn Syria\u2019s water supplies are deteriorating fast, triggering migration and disease and stoking a pollution crisis in neighbouring Lebanon, hydrologists and humanitarian groups have warned.<br></p> <p>\u201cWater security continues to deteriorate for many civilians [in Syria]. Evidence shows that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/jul/02/water-key-conflict-iraq-syria-isis\">control over power and water</a> infrastructure is [being] used as a weapon of warring parties,\u201d said Noosheen Mogadam, a policy adviser with the Norwegian Refugee Council based in Gaziantep on the Turkish-Syrian border. </p> <p>\u201cConflict and protection concerns are the primary drivers for the current displacement trends, [but] a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/dec/27/war-syrian-water-digital-map-boreholes-icrc\">lack of access to water</a> is also cited as a major reason amongst both Syrian refugees and internally displaced people within Syria for fleeing their communities,\u201d she said.</p> <p>According to the UN refugee agency, 6.6 million people have been displaced internally in Syria due to the war and around 4.3 million people have fled to Lebanon, Turkey, Jordan and Europe in the last six years.<br></p> <p>\u201cDamaged [water] infrastructure, a lack of maintenance, and limited power supply has resulted in a 50% reduction in access to safe water [in Syria],\u201d said Mogadam.<br></p> <p>The environmental effects of the war are widely seen in neighbouring Lebanon which has received 1.8 million Syrian refugees in six years, said Nadim Farajalla, a professor of hydrology and water resources at the American University of Beirut. </p> <p>Lebanon, which has many rivers and water sources, is water-rich compared to Jordan, Israel or much of Syria. But the amount of renewable water available in the country has dropped from more than 1,000 cubic metres a year per person \u2013 considered the threshold of water poverty \u2013 to around 700m3 per person since the refugees arrived, Farajalla said.</p> <p>The extra pressure put on Lebanon\u2019s water supplies and sanitation is the equivalent of a sudden 30% increase in population and is now critical, he said. \u201cThis influx of people has had a severely negative impact ... with increasing demand on water, higher generation of sewage that goes untreated and an increase in solid waste that is often disposed of in dumps. All of this has put water resources in Lebanon under severe pressure \u2013 high demand coupled with increasing pollution,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cPeople just don\u2019t realise how critical Lebanon\u2019s water resources is. Refugees arriving when there was already a drought really killed us. The human tragedy is worsening, threatening the lives and the livelihoods of both refugees and their host communities through a resource that is supposed to be the source of life.\u201d </p> <p>\u201cThe [water] situation is getting worse throughout the Middle East region,\u201d said Ashok Swain, director of the International Centre for Water Cooperation, who has co-authored a new book on emerging security threats in the Middle East.</p> <p>\u201cThe Middle East as a whole has the lowest per capita water availability in the world. At the same time it has also one of the highest rates of population growth. Governments have largely focused on water supply management, through desalination. Current co-operation over water resources is minimal. That needs to change,\u201d he said at a water conference in Stockholm.</p> <p>Co-author Dr Anders J\u00e4gerskog, water adviser to the Swedish government in Amman, Jordan, said water was an indirect security threat throughout the Middle East. \u201cMore attention needs to be paid to water, population, food and energy supplies. These are not direct security threats, like the Islamic State, but rather are growing behind the headlines and may contribute to more immediate threats in the years to come. Food availability, water scarcity and large population migration are all challenges that are set to increase in importance.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"277bd67c299963a601fdbb4e9aa35eab674af995\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/277bd67c299963a601fdbb4e9aa35eab674af995/0_0_3771_2592/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Syrian women till the fields in the drought-hit region of Hasaka in northeastern Syria\" width=\"1000\" height=\"687\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Syrian women till the fields in the drought-hit region of Hasaka in northeastern Syria, June 2010.

Water should be seen as one of many areas that can contribute to migration,\u201d said J\u00e4gerskog.</p> <p>Middle-East water researcher Francesca de Ch\u00e2tel said that the roots of the Syrian conflict were to be found in 50 years of Syria\u2019s mismanagement of water, the failure of intensive, irrigated wheat and cotton farming, and growing water scarcity.</p> <p>\u201cThe failure of largescale agricultural development projects from the 1950s onwards undermined farmers\u2019 livelihoods and dislocated rural communities.

  "<p>Japan\u2019s former prime minister <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/jul/01/justinmccurry.theobserver\">Junichiro Koizumi</a> has labelled the country\u2019s current leader, Shinzo Abe, a \u201cliar\u201d for telling the international community that the situation at the wrecked <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/fukushima\">Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant</a> is under control.</p> <p>Koizumi, who became one of Japan\u2019s most popular postwar leaders during his 2001-06 premiership, has used his retirement from frontline politics to become a leading campaigner against nuclear restarts in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/japan\">Japan</a> in defiance of Abe, a fellow conservative Liberal Democratic party (LDP) politician who was once regarded as his natural successor.</p> <p>Abe told members of the International Olympic Committee (IOC) in Buenos Aires in September 2013 that the situation at Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant was \u201cunder control\u201d, shortly before Tokyo was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/sep/07/tokyo-host-2020-olympic-games\">awarded the 2020 Games</a>.</p> <p>IOC officials were concerned by reports about the huge build-up of contaminated water at the Fukushima site, more than two years after the disaster forced the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/sep/08/japan-nuclear-disaster-fukushima-homes\">evacuation of tens of thousands of residents</a>.</p> <p>\u201cWhen [Abe] said the situation was under control, he was lying,\u201d Koizumi told reporters in Tokyo. \u201cIt is not under control,\u201d he added, noting the problems the plant\u2019s operator, Tokyo Electric Power (Tepco), has experienced with a costly subterranean <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/jul/13/doubts-giant-ice-wall-fukushima-nuclear-reactors\">ice wall</a> that is supposed to prevent groundwater from flowing into the basements of the damaged reactors, where it becomes highly contaminated.</p> <p>\u201cThey keep saying they can do it, but they can\u2019t,\u201d Koizumi said. He went on to claim that Abe had been fooled by industry experts who claim that nuclear is the safest, cleanest and cheapest form of energy for resource-poor Japan.</p> <p>\u201cHe believes what he\u2019s being told by nuclear experts,\u201d Koizumi said. \u201cI believed them, too, when I was prime minister. I think Abe understands the arguments on both sides of the debate, but he has chosen to believe the pro-nuclear lobby.\u201d</p> <p>After the Fukushima crisis, Koizumi said he had \u201cstudied the process, reality and history of the introduction of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/nuclearpower\">nuclear power</a>, and became ashamed of myself for believing such lies\u201d.</p> <p>Abe has pushed for the restart of Japan\u2019s nuclear reactors, while the government says it wants nuclear to account for a fifth of Japan\u2019s total energy mix by 2030. Just three of the country\u2019s dozens of nuclear reactors are in operation, and two will be taken offline later this year for maintenance.</p> <p>Koizumi, 74, has also thrown his support behind hundreds of US sailors and marines <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/aug/20/us-navy-sailors-legal-challenge-fukushima-radiation-tepco\">who claim they developed leukaemia and other serious health problems</a> after being exposed to Fukushima radiation plumes while helping with relief operations \u2013 nicknamed Operation Tomodachi (friend) \u2013 following the 11 March 2011 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/japan-earthquake-and-tsunami\">earthquake and tsunami</a>.</p> <p>In 2012 the service personnel launched a lawsuit accusing Tepco of failing to prevent the accident and of lying about the levels of radiation from the stricken reactors, putting US personnel at risk.</p> <p>Most of the 400 plaintiffs were aboard the USS Ronald Reagan, a nuclear-powered aircraft carrier that was anchored off Japan\u2019s north-east coast while helicopters flew emergency supplies to survivors of the tsunami, which killed almost 19,000 people.</p> <p>Medical experts, however, said the sailors would have received only small, non-harmful doses of radiation; a US defence department report published in 2014 said no link had been established between the sailors\u2019 health problems and their exposure to low doses of Fukushima radiation.</p> <p>Koizumi, who met several of the sick servicemen in San Diego in May, plans to raise $1m by the end of next March to help cover the sailors\u2019 medical expenses.</p> <p>\u201cI felt I had to do something to help those who worked so hard for Japan,\u201d he said. \u201cThat won\u2019t be enough money, but at least it will show that Japan is grateful for what they did for us.\u201d</p> <p>Despite his opposition to Abe\u2019s pro-nuclear policies, Koizumi was complimentary about his performance as prime minister during his second time in office in the past decade.</p> <p>\u201cAs far as nuclear power is concerned, we are totally at odds,\u201d Koizumi said. \u201cBut I think he\u2019s reflected on the mistakes he made during his first time as leader and is doing a much better job second time around.\u201d</p> <p>In political longevity terms, Abe\u2019s performance could hardly be worse.

The law is like life \u2013 full of grey areas, disputes, conflict and uncertainty. It does its best to cope with the flux of human interaction, but often fails, and its practitioners prove to be as prone to bad behaviour as everybody else.</p> <p>Literature has a habit of stereotyping lawyers, but some writers look for the lawyers who usurp convention, who don\u2019t fit into our preconceived notions of what they should be and how they should behave. My main character in <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://flackslastshift.com/\">Flack\u2019s Last Shift</a><em tabindex=\"-1\"> </em>is a lawyer who seems to fit the mould, but longs to break it \u2013 rather like many lawyers I know.</p> <p>And much as I like Atticus, the ethically unchallenged defence counsel and hero of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/feb/19/harper-lee\">Harper Lee</a>\u2019s To Kill a Mockingbird, I think literature\u2019s most memorable lawyers are the morally compromised, the guilty-as-charged, the ineffectual and the damned. Here are my top 10, including \u2013 yes, it\u2019s true \u2013 two who are actually quite nice.</p> <p><strong>1. Dr Gonzo in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/nov/08/fear-and-loathing-condensed\">Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas by Hunter S Thompson</a></strong><br></p> <p>One of the high priests of new journalism, Thompson set a lawyer at the heart of this, his most famous book<em>. </em>Dr Gonzo is one of two protagonists in a drug-fuelled mission to report on the Mint 400, a desert race near Las Vegas. Based on Oscar \u201cZeta\u201d Acosta, a well-known American attorney, Dr Gonzo alternately hallucinates, crashes cars and smashes hotel rooms, emerging as \u201chell on wheels in a bar brawl\u201d and capable of ingesting just about every illegal substance known.</p> <p><strong>2. Herr Huld in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/jan/15/john-banville-kafka-trial-rereading\">The Trial by Franz Kafka</a></strong></p> <p>The Trial\u2019s main character, Joseph K, is arrested but never told for what alleged offence. Despite K\u2019s tireless quest for justice, access to \u201cthe law\u201d proves to be impossible, in part because his own lawyer, Herr Huld, is so useless. For all his insistence that courtroom connections are of greater value than drafting K\u2019s defence petition, Huld\u2019s place of work \u2013 his bed \u2013 sums up his indolence. </p> <p><strong>3. Captain Vere in <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/billy-budd-sailor.html\">Billy Budd, Sailor by Herman Melville</a></strong></p> <p>Here\u2019s a curio. Vere, skipper of HMS Bellipotent, is not actually a lawyer. But while on the high seas he is invested with legal authority, and seizes it all too willingly when confronted by Billy\u2019s killing of John Claggart, the ship\u2019s master-at-arms. Vere convenes a court martial and adroitly switches roles, one minute judge, the next prosecutor, then acting for the defence and even appearing as a witness. The morally innocent Billy is executed. Vere\u2019s jurisprudential elasticity plays on his mind until his own death.</p> <p><strong>4. Emma Zunz in Emma Zunz by Jorges Luis Borges </strong></p> <p>OK, this a bit leftfield, but Borges was a great one for writing about what isn\u2019t there \u2013 and while this tale of vengeance leaves the conventional apparatus of the law off the page, justice is nevertheless its key theme. Emma, convinced that her employer is responsible for her father\u2019s death, goes to extraordinary lengths to ensure his demise, even sleeping with a stranger so that she can allege that her boss assaulted her. Her ensuing act of bogus self-defence leaves her vindicated and yet ashamed \u2013 and this strange, slight tale leaves us, as readers, wondering if \u201cjustice\u201d is somehow always compromised. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6943efb091d51dc161ddb218d5269f82c25c206a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6943efb091d51dc161ddb218d5269f82c25c206a/0_0_2054_1366/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Charles Dance as Tulkinghorn in the BBC adaptation of Charles Dickens\u2019s Bleak House.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"665\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Charles Dance as Tulkinghorn in the BBC adaptation of Charles Dickens\u2019s Bleak House.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: BBC/Mike Hogan/BBC</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>5. Tulkinghorn in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/aug/12/charles-dickens-bleak-house-book-that-changed-me\">Bleak House by Charles Dickens</a></strong></p> <p> Back to the law as we know and do not love it. Bleak House gave us the case of Jarndyce v Jarndyce, a byword for legal prolixity: \u201cJarndyce and Jarndyce drones on. This scarecrow of a suit has, in course of time, become so complicated, that no man alive knows what it means.\u201d Dickens\u2019s fictional dispute over an estate \u201cdrags its dreary length before the court, perennially hopeless\u201d until there is nothing of the estate left. The novel\u2019s scheming lawyer, Tulkinghorn, stops at nothing in service of his client, Sir Leicester Dedlock. Bribery, blackmail, even abduction \u2013 all are par for the course, because he is irreducibly evil. No doubt Dickens enjoyed killing him off.</p> <p><strong>6. Quinn in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2006/oct/14/fiction.paulauster\">Travels in the Scriptorium </a>by Paul Auster</strong></p> <p>It\u2019s not one of Auster\u2019s best works but Travels in the Scriptorium is notable for the metamorphosis of Quinn, a character in his superb New York Trilogy, from private detective to lawyer. Mr Blank, a typical Auster figure, sits alone in a room, with not much more than a strange manuscript to keep him company. As if lawyers can help, soon enough he asks to see his attorney. \u201cDon\u2019t you recognise me?\u201d says the lawyer, when he turns up. \u201cI was your first operative. I\u2019m Quinn.\u201d Woe betide anyone whose lawyer says he\u2019s an \u201coperative\u201d.</p> <p><strong>7. Guillaumin in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2002/jul/27/classics.asbyatt\">Madame Bovary by Gustave Flaubert</a></strong></p> <p>Spare a thought for Emma Bovary. Married to the desperately dull Dr Bovary, she relies on the staple source of escape from the quotidian \u2013 the affair. A few affairs, in fact. They lead to her downfall but, worse, when she seeks help from Guillaumin, a lawyer, he is nothing but a shark in wolf\u2019s clothing: he\u2019ll help Emma with her finances, but only in return for sex. Note: if any lawyer ever suggests this, shame them on social media (it\u2019s more effective than a complaint to the Solicitors Regulation Authority).</p> <p><strong>8. Sandor Himmelstein in<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2005/apr/09/saulbellow\"> Herzog by Saul Bellow</a></strong></p> <p>Here\u2019s another tricky customer. Sandor Himmelstein is the lawyer to Moses E Herzog, Bellow\u2019s eponymous protagonist. Herzog is going through a divorce, but staying with Himmelstein doesn\u2019t do him any favours. He\u2019s bullied by the lawyer, who despises Herzog\u2019s emotional response to the world and merrily declares of his profession: \u201cWe\u2019re all whores.\u201d There are various morals in Herzog; one might be to never, ever stay with your lawyer. </p> <p><strong>9. Casi in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/aug/29/naked-singularity-sergio-pava-review\">A Naked Singularity by Sergio De La Pava</a></strong></p> <p> De La Pava\u2019s wild and sprawling depiction of the bewildering work of a New York public defender amassed nearly 90 rejections before <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/jun/27/sergio-de-la-pava-naked-singularity-interview\">the author, himself a lawyer</a>, decided to self-publish. His novel went on to become a publishing sensation. Its lead character is Casi, a young lawyer who wins every case he takes, until he is persuaded by a fellow lawyer to steal some drug money. Even as Casi crosses moral, ethical and legal lines, he can\u2019t stop worrying about his clients and the criminals he\u2019s robbing. His pledge that \u201cnothing detrimental or untoward would ever happen to a client of mine\u201d remains intact; the novel is hysterical, surreal, moving and wonderful. </p> <p><strong>10. Don Sebastiano in <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/day-of-judgement-390536.html\">The Day of Judgment by Salvatore Satta</a></strong></p> <p>This beautiful, elegant and haunting book was published posthumously in 1979. Early 20th-century life in the Sardinian town of Nuoro is seen through the eyes of local lawyer Don Sebastiano. \u201cHis vocation was orderliness, which is the basis of creation,\u201d writes Satta. \u201cAccordingly, when a letter came, he would turn it over in his hands for a long time, gazing at it meditatively; then he would put it away in a file without opening it, because everything had its own time.\u201d </p> <p></p> <ul> <li><em>Flack\u2019s Last Shift by Alex Wade is published by Blue Mark Books for \u00a314.99 and <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/flack-s-last-shift.html\">is available from the Guardian Bookshop for \u00a312.29</a>.</em><br></li> </ul>",

  "<p>Maria Callas stands in a narrow alcove beyond a barrier in a dark and resounding space. A holographic apparition, Callas is a woman in red, played by artist <a href=\"https://www.centrepompidou.fr/cpv/resource/cLboMKK/r4y4qr7\">Dominique Gonzalez-Foerster</a>, lip-synching the diva\u2019s voice as she sings arias from Cherubini\u2019s Medea, Verdi\u2019s La Traviata and Ponchielli\u2019s La Gioconda. </p> <p>We are in a cavernous concrete floor of <a href=\"http://180thestrand.com\">Store</a>, a brutalist office block on London\u2019s Strand, now occupied by the Hayward\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.southbankcentre.co.uk/whatson/infinite-mix-1001731\">The Infinite Mix</a>, an offsite exhibition (the Hayward gallery itself is closed for a two-year refurbishment) devoted to sound and image, video and music. As well as the holographic ghost of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/sep/17/maria-callas-dead-opera-1977\">Maria Callas</a>, Gonzalez-Foerster gives us an aural apparition of the opera house itself, with recorded whispers from the audience and the echoey background noise of an auditorium whose volume is larger than the space we are in. There is a yearning for something always beyond reach in Gonzalez-Foerster\u2019s work that I like very much.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"5438bf0cad17231e78837a4c8947b7fe0b1c78b0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5438bf0cad17231e78837a4c8947b7fe0b1c78b0/0_358_2832_3539/800.jpg\" alt=\"Dominique Gonzalez-Foerster\u2019s Opera.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dominique Gonzalez-Foerster\u2019s Opera.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: \u00a9 DACS, 2016.

The dancing plant-life and trees in his film lurch out at you, waving around to the dub-reggae rhythm of the chorus to Alton Ellis\u2019s 1970 <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VktZlcx6Nr4\">Blackman\u2019s World</a>. \u201cAww-wah, I was born a loser,\u201d Ellis wails, over and over. Gaillard\u2019s film takes us from night-time corners of LA to the Nazi-era Olympiastadion in Berlin, where we go airborne into the heart of a firework display via a drone-operated camera. </p> <p>Oo-err, I say, rather than Ooh-ahhh! Then we find ourselves amid the branches of the oak tree that stands outside the Cleveland high school attended by Olympic gold-medallist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/london-2012-olympics-blog/2011/dec/21/jesse-owens-four-gold-medals\">Jesse Owens</a> (the sapling oak was presented to the runner by the organisers of the 1936 Berlin Olympics). Nightlife is completed by a sample from Ellis\u2019s 1971 cover of his earlier song. \u201cI was born a winner,\u201d he sings. There is a lot to unpack in Gaillard\u2019s film, but all that 3D foliage keeps poking me in the eye.</p> <p>Pumped up from doing synchronised press-ups on an extremely smart living room floor, a group of young black men are distracted by thoughts of sex. One thing leads to another: one minute they\u2019re fingering the cushions and eyeing up an occasional table, the next they\u2019re humping the upholstery and the carpet, and doing it with the three-piece suite. Unaccountably, they\u2019re wearing dust-masks and dog-tags. These scenes from a room in Montgomery, Alabama, shot on mobile phones and camcorders, and transferred to 35mm come with one of Sonic Youth\u2019s more memorable tracks, 2009\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtZmHpHAYDA\">Massage the History</a>. Kim Gordon\u2019s vocal, says film-maker <a href=\"http://www.walkerart.org/collections/artists/cameron-jamie\">Cameron Jamie</a>, made the whole thing more strange than the original hip-hop beat, as if things weren\u2019t already weird enough.</p> <p>There\u2019s more mad dancing in Bom Bom\u2019s Dream, another Jeremy Deller collaboration with Argentinian Cecilia Bengolea. Bom Bom is a Japanese dancer, all big punk hair, rubber knickers and filthy tights, an Alice in Wonderland for our age. Horribly, she reminded me of Toyah Wilcox, except when she gets to dancing, which is very down and dirty in the Jamaican dust. Bom Bom can almost tie her legs in knots, and dances like an all-in wrestler in a voodoo trance, scissor-kicking and squirming and knocking other dancers to the floor. In the end she wins an electric fan \u2013 big up Bom Bom, the dancehall queen! Eventually she gets eaten by the badly patched-in CGI iguana who wanted to marry her. Surely this is piffle. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"15c21741760469fdbc4e69db12ba65b62e41136b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/15c21741760469fdbc4e69db12ba65b62e41136b/0_53_4000_2400/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Stan Douglas\u2019s Luanda-Kinshasa.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Stan Douglas\u2019s Luanda-Kinshasa.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy of the artist.</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><a href=\"https://vimeo.com/81827961\">Martin Creed\u2019s song-length film</a> was shot at a New York intersection. While Creed\u2019s song battles along, people cross the street. A guy with a prosthetic leg crosses like a nimble seaman on a lurching deck. A woman crosses with a bobbing, palsied gait. When she\u2019s gone, a man hops painfully in the other direction, his bandaged foot in a sandal. All the walkers are more or less ambulant till the last, a guy who crosses backwards, on his ass, dragging himself along with his arms. The whole thing is like Creed\u2019s sculptures \u2013 a set of examples, in this case of mobility, persistence and fortitude.</p> <p>Here\u2019s some more examples of types: Afro-haired bass players, studious organists, a wild, female drummer, introverted sax players, jerky, angular guitarists, hepcats all, playing an extended 1970s-style jazz, funk and Afrobeat studio jam that goes on for six hours. No, it is not <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2010/dec/24/miles-davis-bitches-brew\">Miles\u2019s crew from Bitches Brew</a>. There are some fine musicians in Stan Douglas\u2019s <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/94233892\">Luanda-Kinshasa</a>, a 2013 recreation of an imaginary session in a New York Columbia Records studio in the early 1970s. Douglas recorded the musicians at different times and patched the whole thing together to make it look and sound like one long, seamless groove.</p> <p>Rachel Rose\u2019s <a href=\"http://whitney.org/Exhibitions/RachelRose\">Everything and More</a> also has a retro feel, of the sorts of ether, pigment and bubble-bath light-shows that were big in the late 1960s, smearing visual goo over bands in acid-drenched concert. Here, they are used in conjunction with American astronaut David Wolf\u2019s voiceover description of floating in space. Rose\u2019s curdling psychedelic fractals are meant to make you think of galaxies and nebulae, but look like spume on a caramel and passion fruit skinny latte. Rose\u2019s work is projected onto a translucent screen in front of a window looking out over London\u2019s South Bank. I guess we are meant to feel weightless.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"82aed75d8223fc5c19259b73bfcba64602698066\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/82aed75d8223fc5c19259b73bfcba64602698066/0_178_7102_4260/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Rachel Rose\u2019s Everything and More.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rachel Rose\u2019s Everything and More.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Linda Nylind</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Elizabeth Price\u2019s <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/166516474\">multilayered videos</a> are beginning to feel overly mannered, with their PowerPoint-style split screens, montaged clips of old footage and reams of scrolling text. I guess this is deliberate. In K, 2015, country singer <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9lz_yzrGZw\">Crystal Gayle</a> and her backing singers become the Krystals, a group of professional mourners who perform cathartic rituals at funerals and other public and corporate events. Simultaneously, we watch a hi-tech automated loom weaving and package yellow stockings, a mesmeric process that seems to take place in outer space. Price can make the real look like an animation, fiction look like fact.

The territory is familiar from Lamar\u2019s videos, and is synchronised with the same sinewy jump-cuts and melodious rhythms as his music.

  "<p>MPs will debate whether to ban driven grouse shooting after a petition created by a leading conservationist passed the threshold of more than 100,000 signatures.</p> <p>Mark Avery, a campaigner and former head of the RSPB, launched <a href=\"https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/125003\">the petition</a> in March with backing from broadcasters Chris Packham and Bill Oddie, and the League Against Cruel Sports, calling for grouse shooting to be banned because he said it often leads to the illegal killing of birds of prey, which eat red grouse.<br></p> <p>\u201cGrouse shooting is economically, ecologically and socially unnecessary. This is \u2018canned hunting\u2019,\u201d said the petition, which had attracted more than 120,000 signatures by Wednesday. Driven shooting involves shooters in hides and beaters driving out the grouse, compared to \u2018walked-up\u2019 shooting, where shooters walk across the moor and flush out the the grouse themselves.<br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/aug/12/grouse-shootings-rich-influential-backers-join-forces-fire-on-critics\">Grouse shooting's rich, influential backers join forces to fire on critics</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The shooting industry and conservationists clashed last month around the \u2018glorious twelth\u2019 - the traditional start of the shooting season - with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/video/2016/aug/12/chris-packham-and-ian-botham-clash-over-grouse-shooting-ban-audio\">Packham debating with Ian Botham of pro-shooting group You Forgot the Birds over a proposed ban</a>. <br></p> <p>The RSPB has also toughened its stance, after dropping out of a government initiative to save the hen harrier because it says landowners and shoots are failing to stop the birds being illegally poisoned and killed. While stopping short of calling for a blanket ban, it <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/jul/25/rspb-calls-for-grouse-shooting-estates-to-be-licensed\">now says shooting estates should be licensed so that authorities have power to ban them if needed</a>.<br></p> <p>Avery said a ban would be a test of whether Theresa May delivered on her promise to work for more than just a privileged few. \u2018I\u2019m delighted that over 120,000 people have supported this petition and that it will be discussed in parliament. Grouse shooting is underpinned by wildlife crime. Birds of prey, that have been fully protected by law since the Winston Churchill government of 1954, are routinely, systematically and ruthlessly killed because they eat grouse,\u201d he told the Guardian.<br></p> <p>He added: \u201cIt\u2019s a conflict between a sport for the rich and our wildlife. I don\u2019t think a Conservative government will turn round and ban grouse shooting, which is, after all, the Tory party at play, but the government will look hypocritical if it doesn\u2019t take proper measures to enforce the law. Theresa May said her government would work for all of us not just the privileged few \u2013 what her government does about crime on grouse moors will be a test of that.\u201d<br></p> <p>The British Association for Shooting and Conservation (BASC) said that it would robustly fight a ban.</p> <p>Tim Russell, BASC director of conservation, said: \u201cWe welcome this debate because it provides an opportunity to correct some of the misinformation that has been spread by anti-shooting extremists. Grouse shooting makes a significant contribution to the economy, provides jobs and investment in some of the UK\u2019s most remote areas and offers important benefits for wildlife and habitat conservation.\u201d</p> <p>In response to the petition, the environment department said: \u201cWhen carried out according to the law, grouse shooting is a legitimate activity and in addition to its significant economic contribution, providing jobs and investment in some of our most remote areas, it can offer important benefits for wildlife and habitat conservation.\u201d </p>",

Video by Laurence Mathieu-L\u00e9ger</em></li> </ul> <p>In recent years the US has begun to reckon with its role as the world\u2019s biggest jailer, home to a manifestly unequal justice system that disproportionately punishes poor people of color. In diagnosing the causes of this problem much of the focus has centered on sentencing reform, but in a country where <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.cato.org/publications/commentary/devils-bargain-how-plea-agreements-never-contemplated-framers-undermine-justice\">95% of criminal cases are settled by plea deal</a>, little attention has been given to the critical state of indigent defense. Around the US, defenders routinely report an increase in overburdening and underfunding, caused by a variety of structural, political and economic drivers.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Up-to-date figures are scant, but <a href=\"http://www.americanbar.org/content/dam/aba/administrative/legal_aid_indigent_defendants/ls_sclaid_def_expenditures_fy08.authcheckdam.pdf\">according to a 2008 estimate by the American Bar Association</a>, state and county governments spent a total of $5.3bn on indigent defense systems a year, just 2.5% of the roughly $200bn spent on criminal justice by states and local government every year. The depth of crisis varies in each state, indicative of the complex patchwork of defense systems that are funded and administered differently dependent on jurisdiction. </p> <p>In Missouri, for example, where the defender office is funded entirely at the state level, Governor Jay Nixon has <a href=\"http://www.columbiamissourian.com/news/legislature-gives-governor-takes-away-public-defender-system-increase/article_319f5927-f50b-52a8-ab64-b5e607d84667.html\">repeatedly blocked</a> the passage of state legislation to cap defenders\u2019 workloads and increase their funding. Most recently, <a href=\"http://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/less-new-money-for-public-defenders-in-missouri-as-governor/article_3962607e-b4cf-586b-b491-f18d7c6f96a7.html\">in July</a>, Nixon withheld $3.5m of a relief fund approved by the state legislature to hire additional staff. As a result, the Missouri system is chronically overburdened, <a href=\"http://www.americanbar.org/content/dam/aba/events/legal_aid_indigent_defendants/2014/ls_sclaid_5c_the_missouri_project_report.authcheckdam.pdf\">according to a 2014 study</a>, which found the office was in need of 270 more staff to meet increasing caseloads. </p> <p>Instead, said the director of the state\u2019s defender program, Michael Barrett, the office has lost 30 staff members since 2014 due to funding cuts, and is taking on 12% more cases \u2013 now 82,000 a year. Barrett said this meant defenders were often juggling upwards of 150 cases at a time, with an average of $350 available for each client, ranging from minor misdemeanor cases to non-capital murders. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--showcase\"> <blockquote> <p>In Cole County, Missouri, defenders work more than 225% above the recommended caseload limits</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cLet\u2019s put that in context: if you or I were to hire counsel for a simple DUI, it would cost thousands of dollars,\u201d Barrett said. </p> <p>Last month, Barrett took a novel approach to mitigate the crisis. He <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/04/missouri-public-defender-jay-nixon-governor\">attempted to compel Nixon</a>, a former<strong> </strong>attorney general and private-practice lawyer, to represent a 50-year-old illiterate white man in Cole County \u2013 a right Barrett claimed he has under state law.</p> <p>\u201cGiven the extraordinary circumstances that compel me to entertain any and all avenues for relief, it strikes me that I should begin with the one attorney in the state who not only created this problem, but is in a unique position to address it,\u201d Barrett wrote. </p> <p>The case itself was not extraordinary, Barrett said, but the defender\u2019s office in Cole County is one of the most overburdened in the state, where defenders work more than 225% above the recommended caseload limits. </p> <p>At a preliminary hearing weeks later, a judge handed down a single-page ruling which found that Barrett did not have the authority to compel the governor. \u201cI was disappointed but not surprised,\u201d said Barrett, adding that the case has now been assigned to one of his own overloaded attorneys. </p> <p>The situation in Kentucky, another state-funded system, is a little different; funding difficulties are tied to the legislature rather than the governor\u2019s office. Although the defender program was spared from <a href=\"https://thinkprogress.org/kentuckys-governor-dramatically-cut-education-funding-now-he-s-getting-sued-22c46d80f48#.do3rqljga\">sweeping budget cuts across the state</a>, earlier this year the state senate rejected a <a href=\"http://www.wkyt.com/content/news/Ky-Court-Concerns--600-jobs-in-jeopardy-while-millions-in-additional-resources-cut-from-budget-373765891.html\">$6.2m budget increase</a> handed down by a sympathetic Republican governor, Matt Bevin, which would have created 44 new positions in the defender\u2019s office.</p> <p>Kentucky defenders took on average <a href=\"http://dpa.ky.gov/NR/rdonlyres/601051E3-4025-4452-B205-3A69B0612B58/0/AnnualReportFY2015optimized.pdf\">448 cases in the past year</a>, 54% above recommended national standards. Attorneys take on 11% more cases than they did a decade ago, and in areas such as Louisville now take close to double the national standard. The department received $49m last year \u2013 less than 0.5% of the overall state budget. </p> <p>Even in Colorado, a state-funded system where the defender\u2019s office is subject to a number of legislative safeguards that makes it one the most well funded in the country, agency executive Doug Wilson said his department was operating at a 10% staffing deficit. \u201cI\u2019m not telling you we\u2019re fully funded and everything is peachy,\u201d Wilson said. \u201cI\u2019m just telling you, we\u2019re in better shape than most agencies across the country.\u201d</p> <p>In Utah, an estimated 62% of all misdemeanor defendants had no access to counsel at all, and at the very least 35% of public defense attorneys are overloaded with cases. Again, the root causes are different. Indigent defense is funded entirely at the county level, and in all but two counties indigent defense is provided by contracted attorneys \u2013 rather than defender\u2019s offices \u2013 who are subjected to no state oversight and are paid a fixed fee per case. As such, concluded <a href=\"http://sixthamendment.org/6ac/6AC_utahreport.pdf\">a recent study by the Sixth Amendment Center</a>, defense providers in most of Utah are essentially incentivized to work their cases quickly instead of effectively, and are thereby systematically subjected to a conflict of interest. </p> <p>But perhaps nowhere in the US is this crisis felt more acutely than in Louisiana, where Americans are incarcerated at a higher rate than any other state, and where the defender system is already on the brink of meltdown.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--showcase\"> <blockquote> <p>Unlike any other state, Louisiana pays for its defense system primarily through speeding tickets and other local revenue</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p><a href=\"http://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/idsus0812.pdf\">Unlike any other state</a>, Louisiana pays for its indigent defense system primarily through speeding tickets and other locally generated revenue, rather than guaranteeing funds through the budgeting process. As a result, the finances of each defender\u2019s office are subject to an extraordinarily high level of uncertainty, especially in districts without major highways \u2013 and during floods and other emergencies, when the police and courts are doling out fewer tickets.</p> <p>Earlier this year, that unstable system was thrown into further disarray by Louisiana\u2019s worst budget crisis in decades, which came in the wake of a steep drop in oil prices and years of tax-slashing by former governor Bobby Jindal. Around the state, defenders went into triage, putting thousands of their clients on waitlists for a lawyer.<br></p> <p>But national attention on the crisis has waned, in part because conditions have improved in the city that receives no shortage of media coverage, New Orleans. After receiving a small influx of funds, the public defender\u2019s office there ended its hiring freeze while reducing its waitlist to fewer than 40 defendants.<br></p> <p>Out in Louisiana\u2019s 63 other parishes, however, much of this summer\u2019s improvement in the indigent defense system is shallower than it appears. In Caddo Parish, the courts have addressed the public defender\u2019s funding problems by appointing all the lawyers in town \u2013 including tax, real estate and adoption attorneys \u2013 to the cases that were being neglected, which has superficially resolved the waitlist. In Winn Parish, a prosecutor is now working part-time as a defender, another makeshift and constitutionally questionable way of making do in the absence of funding.<br></p> <p>In the 16th judicial district, up to 50 poor defendants are convicted and sentenced \u2013 at once \u2013 for major felonies carrying up to decades in prison, while the single public defender representing all of them struggles to present any of the facts and arguments in their separate cases. And in the 20th district, exactly one lawyer is now employed to run a defender\u2019s office that covers two parishes and more than 900 cases.</p> <p>Over the next two days, the Marshall Project, in collaboration with the Guardian, will focus on the dire state of public defense in Louisiana and the often bizarre coping strategies some parishes have been forced to take.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"b05f26fae394d34b37bdde19c720e677732734ef\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b05f26fae394d34b37bdde19c720e677732734ef/129_0_1898_1139/1000.jpg\" alt=\"piles of legal paperwork\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Louisiana\u2019s funding of public defenders \u2013 primarily through local court fees and traffic tickets \u2013 has left the system on the brink of meltdown.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Laurence Mathieu-L\u00e9ger/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>How bad is the picture around the country? Frustratingly, the scale of the problem remains unknown as dozens of states and jurisdictions produce no reliable data at all on the condition of their public defense systems. </p> <p>The last nationwide survey of public defender offices was carried out almost 10 years ago by the Department of Justice\u2019s bureau of justice statistics (BJS). The findings were stark: <a href=\"http://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/clpdo07.pdf\">73% of county-operated defender systems</a>, utilized in 27 states, were functioning above the maximum recommended caseload level. </p> <p>In the <a href=\"http://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/spdp07.pdf\">22 state centralized defender programs</a>, 15 ran on caseload levels that exceeded the recommended case limit. In a world of meagre measurement and inadequate oversight, many argue the findings were a significant underestimate of the nationwide strain on the system.</p> <p>In 2013, the BJS embarked on a follow-up survey, aiming to examine all forms of indigent defense systems \u2013 not just the defender\u2019s offices examined in 2013. But the process has been arduous. Although the department has had a full response rate among state-administered offices, only 70% of county-based programs have responded, meaning publication of this side of the research may be delayed until spring of next year. </p> <p>Suzanne Strong, the statistician leading the research, described many of the county-based systems as a \u201ccompletely unknown universe\u201d.</p> <p>Despite the urgency of the crisis, recognized by both the US attorney general, <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/opa/speech/attorney-general-loretta-e-lynch-delivers-remarks-white-house-convening-incarceration-and\">Loretta Lynch</a>, and her predecessor, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/eric-holder-defendants-legal-rights-undermined-by-budget-cuts/2013/08/22/efccbec8-06bc-11e3-9259-e2aafe5a5f84_story.html?utm_term=.774ebf342613\">Eric Holder</a>, the issue remains intractable. Congressional bills offering defender\u2019s offices easier access to federal grant money have gone nowhere. </p> <p>And in an election year during which Hillary Clinton has explicitly promised to \u201creform our criminal justice system from end to end\u201d, dealing with the crisis in funding defense of the poorest people coming before the courts does not feature on her platform for change. Donald Trump, who has promised to be \u201cthe law and order candidate\u201d, has a vision for reform that goes no further than a vow to appoint \u201cthe best prosecutors and law enforcement officials in the country\u201d.</p> <p>In Washington, Democratic congressman Ted Deutch introduced in 2013 the <a href=\"https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/113/hr3407\">National Center for the Right to Counsel Act</a>, legislation that would create a private, non-profit centre to provide training, research initiatives and grant funding to defender\u2019s offices around the country. Although the legislation was endorsed by a spectrum of legal groups, including the American Bar Association, it got nowhere in the House and was subsequently reintroduced last year.</p> <p>\u201cThere has been a lot of bipartisan conversation here about criminal justice reforms, but most of that is focused on sentencing reform,\u201d Deutch said. \u201cWe will continue to struggle with mass incarceration if we don\u2019t do something to stop the system from feeding people into our prisons.</p> <p>\u201cIn Washington, it sometimes takes a long time to help people recognize the problem that exists and that we have to grapple with.\u201d</p> <p>A few days spent in the courtrooms of rural Louisiana might be a start.</p> <ul> <li><em>Tomorrow, the ruinous effects of Louisiana\u2019s inadequate public defense funding, leaving real estate and adoption attorneys \u2013 and even prosecutors \u2013 to fill the gaps</em></li> </ul>",

It will be in the plan \u2026 I am not committing to any specific piece of legislation at this stage.\u201d</p> <p>Truss said it was essential that the prison reform programme would work and be deliverable, and implied that there was not yet any detailed Ministry of Justice plan to implement it.</p> <p>\u201cIt is a bit difficult to say at this early stage. I want to lay out a plan. The pace of what is happening on the ground will not slow. The key thing is that it has to be deliverable and we have to do things in the right order. That is what I am looking at,\u201d said Truss.</p> <p>\u201cI am working on a delivery plan at the moment, which we do not currently have.</p> <p>\u201cMy predecessor was specifically focused on reform prisons, which I think are an excellent idea. I am looking at the overall system in which they operate as well \u2026 I am not committing to any specific piece of legislation at this stage. That will be in the plan.\u201d</p> <p>The Conservative chairman of the committee, Bob Neill, expressed astonishment that Truss could not guarantee the centrepiece of the Queen\u2019s speech, asking: \u201cAre we not going to get one? It is surprising that you can\u2019t tell us whether it will happen in this session.\u201d<br></p> <p>Gove promised that a prison reform green paper would be published this autumn and a major prison and courts reform bill introduced early next year. He announced the creation of six \u201creform\u201d prisons, including Wandsworth in London, but the promised autonomy for their governors is severely restricted by current legislation.</p> <p>The decision to pause Gove\u2019s prison plans and test whether they can actually work represents a major departure by May from Gove\u2019s programme, which was strongly endorsed by Cameron in a major speech.</p> <p>In her first appearance before the justice select committee, Truss made clear she would not \u201carbitrarily\u201d cut the current 85,000 prison population to deal with budget pressures. </p> <p>She did commit to opening five new prisons by 2020 but was not able to say how much of the \u00a31.3bn cost of building them would have to come from the capital receipts of selling existing dilapidated inner-city prisons.</p> <p>The justice secretary also declined to give further details of the new specialist \u201cjihadi\u201d units in maximum security jails saying only that they would hold a small number of the most subversive prisoners. But she refused to say how many units were planned or how many they would hold.</p> <p>A Ministry of Justice spokesperson said: \u201cThe government remains totally committed to legislating on prison reform and will come forward with plans in due course.</p> <p> \u201cWe also remain committed to legislating on reform of our court system to provide a better and more efficient service. Again, we will come forward with plans in due course.\u201d </p> <p>Labour\u2019s Jo Stevens, the shadow justice minister, said Truss\u2019s appearance showed Conservative prison policy was in tatters. \u201cUrgent action is long overdue and the prison reform bill was the central piece of this year\u2019s lightweight Queen\u2019s speech, but today she refused to confirm its fate,\u201d Stevens said.</p> <p>\u201cBy failing to tackle the prisons crisis which developed on their watch, the Tories have yet again demonstrated that they have no plan for the challenges this country faces.\u201d</p> <p>Truss also faced criticism from the Liberal Democrats\u2019 justice spokesman, Jonathan Marks, who said the government had \u201cdropped\u201d its prison reform agenda. He said: \u201cIt is a mark of this reckless, divisive and uncaring government that they are pushing full steam ahead with their plans to scrap our Human Rights Act in a bid to fulfil an ill-conceived manifesto promise whilst postponing much needed prison reform.<br></p> <p>\u201cOur prisons are overcrowded and England and Wales continue to have the highest imprisonment in western Europe. This has led to increased violence in our prisons and the highest number of deaths in prison on record. If this government does not look seriously at reducing the prison population there will be a crisis on our hands.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>And now, the end is near. As the world gets twinkly eyed about the Obamas leaving the White House, one fashion truth remains. Since 2009, the family have offered up a masterclass in how to look great as high-profile public figures while also semaphoring wildly with their clothes. Think: Michelle in a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2016/jul/26/stylewatch-michelle-obama-at-the-democratic-convention\">twisty thunder-blue Christian Siriano dress</a> at this year\u2019s Democratic convention or Malia wearing a <a href=\"http://metro.co.uk/2016/09/06/malia-obama-stuck-it-to-the-haters-with-her-smoking-kills-t-shirt-6112027/\">Smoking Kills T-shirt</a> at a Philadelphia festival: statement pieces, in both senses.</p> <p>Barack Obama\u2019s all-black Adidas tracksuit, which has floated back into the public consciousness (it\u2019s from 2009), is part of that family tradition. Currently setting comedy pulses racing on Twitter, according to internet wags he looks like a (delete as appropriate) a rapper from Soundcloud, someone who only texts you after 2am (the \u201869\u2019 in the background was not lost on the commentators), or <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/skepta\">Skepta</a> (whose trademark look is the all-black tracksuit).</p> <p>What makes it wholly Barack\u2019s, though, is that he has worn it with trainers and a T-shirt from Adidas\u2019s arch rival Nike. It could be a subversive stripes with non-matching stripes moment but, let\u2019s be honest, is probably more in keeping with Obama\u2019s trademark dad style. Such mixing of sports brands is very: \u201cHey son, what is a \u2018Snapchat\u2019\u201d?\u201d But it looks great and fits with the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2016/jan/09/ladwear-king-of-the-catwalk-london-collections-men\">current trend</a> where a retro tracksuit is the new smart casual (mixing trackies with a smart jacket is very <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/fashion-blog/2015/jan/10/why-christopher-shannon-is-still-at-the-cutting-edge-of-fashion\">Christopher Shannon</a> and <a href=\"http://www.gq.com/story/obama-tracksuit-meme\">Joseph</a>).<br></p> <p>It is also a poignant reminder of the consistent style the Obamas have brought to their seven-and-a-half years in the White House.

When energy is driven by the needs of people, it will be greener \u2013 because saving the planet is in the interests of everyone.</p> <p>That is why I am today announcing a bold new set of policies which will pioneer a democratic, community-led system of energy supply. Over the course of the next parliament, we will use public investment and legislation to promote the creation of over 200 local energy companies, giving towns, cities and localities the powers they need to drive a clean, locally accountable energy system with public, not-for-profit companies.</p> <p>At the heart of this policy will be a new generation of community energy co-operatives.

We will create a National Home Insulation programme to insulate at least 4m homes to energy efficiency standard B or C. In the private rented sector, we will set compulsory standards at the same level and end the misery of cold rented accommodation.

We will use a \u00a3500bn national investment programme, with a National Investment Bank and a network of regional development banks, to ensure that these jobs and opportunities are created in places where they are most needed \u2013 in coastal towns and areas with high unemployment.</p> <p>Too often, environmental catastrophe is explained in the same terms as an asteroid hitting the earth. But the problems and the solutions are political \u2013 they are about the prioritisation of profit over the needs of people and, at the heart of it all, a lack of democracy in how decisions are made. By democratising our energy supply, and giving people power over their own destinies, we can rebuild and transform Britain so that no one and no community is left behind.</p>",

Nice little package, if you will. Back in 1895, when the northern clubs broke away, to take the train from Hull (the most easterly) to Widnes (the most westerly) would have taken in 21 of 22, with only (I think) Stockport having presented any major deviation. In fact, the clubs were initially meeting at a pub called The Spread Eagle in Manchester, deemed the central point for all 22 members, However, on the date of the meeting at which the Northern clubs broke from the Southern Union, The Spread Eagle was double-booked, presumably for some sort of Victorian-era darts match or shove ha\u2019penny championship, so the honour of the foundation point went to The George Hotel in Huddersfield.

Vlaar, Darius Vassell and Olof Mellberg have all tried since then and ended up wishing they hadn\u2019t. In fact, the only Villa players ever to score for their country in a shootout are David Platt v West Germany in 1990 and Tony Cascarino, who scuffed an effort into the net for the Republic of Ireland against Romania at the 1990 World Cup only three months after becoming Villa\u2019s record signing (incidentally, his tally of 11 goals in 46 matches for Villa means Cascarino could also be in the running as a decent answer to the next question, below). Jean II Makoun scored for Cameroon in their epic 12-11 shootout victory over Ivory Coast at the 2006 Africa Cup of Nations but that, of course, was when the midfielder was at Lille, five years before he became a Villan.</p> <p>As for the English club with the most prolific scorers in international shootouts, that is Arsenal (14), with Chelsea (10) second, although Chelsea players have also been responsible for five misses, more than any other English club \u2013 but not quite as many as AC Milan, whose players have managed to miss 10 times in international tournaments (and only score nine times). The club with the most successful takers, meanwhile, is Barcelona, with 21 successful spot-kicks (and five misses).</p> <p><em>As a quick update to this, we can confirm the record still stands. The closest we can get is Jordan Ayew\u2019s successful kick for Ghana in the 2015 Africa Cup of Nations final against Ivory Coast.

Determined to lay bare what she calls \u201cthe constructions of film-making\u201d, she has in turn constructed a montage of what at first seem unconnected scenes identified only by their locations, which include a farm in Bosnia to which a Muslim family returned after the genocide there, a Brooklyn boxing arena where young contenders do battle, a beleaguered natal unit in a Nigerian hospital and a courtroom in Texas where evidence of a horrific race crime unfolded.</p> <p>As the often raw footage establishes its own dissonant rhythm, it coalesces into a kind of meta-narrative in which the viewer is given a sense of what it means to be the person behind the camera, whether waiting patiently for the light to change on a hillside above a nondescript village or deciding how long to linger on an inconsolable subject\u2019s anger or distress. In the title sequence, Johnson asks us to view the film \u201cas a memoir\u201d, but it is also an artful interrogation of herself and her craft, its contradictions, compromises and betrayals.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"88865c109fc31e1186a132e8983b4a9dc6747446\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/88865c109fc31e1186a132e8983b4a9dc6747446/0_0_3872_2592/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Kirsten Johnson in Darfur: \u2018there are moments of grace even among the moments of compromise and betrayal\u2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"669\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Kirsten Johnson in Darfur: \u2018There are moments of grace even among the moments of compromise and betrayal.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Lindsey Addario/New Frontier Films</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cThere are so many moral and ethical crises involved in trying to make images and edit them,\u201d says Johnson, who is best known as the cinematographer of choice for the radical documentary directors <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/michaelmoore\">Michael Moore </a>and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2016/feb/04/laura-poitras-astro-noise-whitney-the-art-of-surveillance\">Laura Poitras</a>. \u201cMany of the films I have made fall short of all our hopes as film-makers and activists or to make a piece of art that will actually change things politically. In fact, we most often fail completely, but there are moments of grace even among the moments of compromise and betrayal.\u201d</p> <p>There are indeed some moments of grace in Cameraperson, but its cumulative power resides to a great degree in the sequences during which Johnson\u2019s subjects are at their most vulnerable and her approach seems most intrusive. The scenes in which a Nigerian midwife struggles to save the life of a newborn baby in a makeshift clinic are viscerally dramatic and prolonged \u2013 we even hear Johnson gasp from behind her camera at one point, while her questions grow increasingly plaintive in tone as it becomes clear that the baby\u2019s survival is imperiled by the lack of basic medical equipment. (\u201cThe incubator was missing an adaptor plug and I had one in my case back at the hotel,\u201d Johnson tells me quietly. \u201cWhen I found that out, it was just too much to take.\u201d)</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://vimeo.com/158939049\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/158939049\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>The footage of a distraught young boxer just after he has lost an important title fight comes close to a kind of voyeuristic stalking. There is a moment when, through the red mist of his rage, he suddenly becomes aware that he is still being filmed, in which you worry for Johnson\u2019s physical safety. Undaunted, she trails him out of the dressing room and back into the arena, where he runs, sobbing, into the arms of his mother. \u201cThat sequence actually felt like a movie was unfolding in front of me,\u201d she says. \u201cIt was as if he was literally drawing me down the corridor into a movie and I had no agency. I was just following him, lost in the intensity of his emotion. And I kept following after the encounter with his mother until he turned and told me to stop filming.\u201d Had she stopped earlier, the revealingly Freudian climax would have gone unrecorded, but, instead, it lays bare the dynamic of machismo more than all the bravado and staged brutality that has preceded it.</p> <p>Both these intimately observed dramas rely for their raw, emotional intensity on Johnson\u2019s willingness to transgress the usual boundaries of personal privacy, tact and even empathy. She goes the extra mile with her camera so that we can do the same at a safe distance, which is where the viewer\u2019s complicity adds yet another level of complexity to the ethical dilemmas of her kind of edgy documentary film-making. \u201cFor the generation I came from, image-making was a rare and precious thing to do,\u201d says Johnson, who studied cinematography at the French National Film School in the late 1980s. (Her first subject as a director-cinematographer was the philosopher <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2004/oct/11/guardianobituaries.france\">Jacques Derrida</a>, who makes a mischievously fleeting appearance in Cameraperson.) \u201cNow, every person who has a phone can film their experiences or turn a camera on another person in trouble or at risk or emotionally vulnerable. I\u2019m concerned as a film-maker with the lack of context that attends this kind of casual witnessing of events.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://vimeo.com/159213561\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/159213561\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>In Cameraperson, Johnson, too, has disregarded overt context, but this serves the purpose of showing how the same dilemmas recur whether she is filming the families of the victims of mass killings in Kosovo or trailing her Alzheimer\u2019s-afflicted mother as she wanders uncertainly through her own house. Do we look or look away? Are we bearing witness or intruding on private emotions? At what point does our concern shade into voyeurism? The questions she asks of herself are the questions we, as alert viewers, should continuously be asking of ourselves. Yet, for all its self-questioning, Cameraperson is a film that, as Johnson cheerfully acknowledges, cannot break free from the process it exposes: it, too, has been created though a process of selecting, editing and, yes, constructing images.</p> <p>I ask her, in conclusion, if the decision to show glimpses of her mother\u2019s unravelling self was the most difficult one she had to make. (Her mother has since died.) \u201cIt may not be evident to everyone who views it, but, as it pertains to my relationship with my mother, this was a profound act of betrayal,\u201d she replies without hesitation. \u201cI can say for sure she would not have wanted it. My father is fine with it, but some of the people who knew her are not and it has been hard at times to feel the cold force of their anger.\u201d</p> <p>Why, then, did she include it? \u201cThat is a difficult question to answer,\u201d she says, sounding less confident and articulate than she has throughout the interview. \u201cI don\u2019t know if I would have been capable of it had she been around. I think that, in a way, owning that betrayal is an admission of all the betrayals of trust that have happened in the construction of all these stories. It\u2019s as if two conflicting things can be carried in those images of my mother: our love for each other and my betrayal. That gets to the heart of what the film is attempting to lay bare: what it is to be me and what it is to do the job that I do \u2013 and love doing \u2013 even with all the contradictions and betrayals it entails.\u201d</p>",

Here\u2019s what some of our readers said:<br></p> <h2>\u2018I wanted to meet him on my terms, to shift the power balance\u2019</h2> <p>I was abducted and sexually assaulted when I was eight. He was a serial rapist and has been in jail serving his sentence since 1986. <br></p> <p>I have been in a very long relationship with this man that I don\u2019t know. It is strange to be so impacted by and connected to someone you don\u2019t know. I wanted to meet him on my terms, to shift the power balance, but also to humanise him rather than demonise him, as our society would see us do.</p> <p>It is a powerful connection \u2013 a horrible one, but a powerful one. I wanted to give him some things I had been carrying and wanted to let go of, and to take back some things he took from me. I also wanted to show compassion, and to create a connection. After living almost 30 years with feeling such an intense range of emotions \u2013 hatred, anger, guilt, shame, vengeance, depression, etc. \u2013 I needed to shift my experience and live from a lighter place. <br></p> <p>Truthfully, too, I was curious \u2013 what is this man like? Is he as unstable as has been suggested by his behaviour and reports at the parole hearings? The only way to know some things is to go to the source. And he is the source of so very, very much for me and mine. <br></p> <p> Everyone should have the right to restorative justice. Not everyone will want to do it, and people may feel differently about it at different points of their journey. I look forward to a day when it is seamlessly integrated into the system.<br></p> <p><em>Anonymous, Vancouver</em></p> <h2>\u2018I needed my voice to be heard\u2019<br></h2> <p>My 15-year-old died after taking ecstasy. I went through restorative justice with the drug dealer. We wrote to one another for 18 months. It was an incredibly healing experience. <br></p> <p>I needed my voice to be heard. I wanted to find a positive way through what had happened and for questions to be answered by the person who caused the harm. Through our letters, I got to see that the impact of what had happened lay as heavily on him as it did on me. It helped me hear the voice of the boy behind the headlines, and to have a direct dialogue was important as I needed to lay a few things to rest. <br></p> <p>The world would be a better place if everyone had the opportunity to take part in restorative justice. <br></p> <p><em>Anonymous, Oxfordshire</em></p> <h2>\u2018I overthought his answers and questioned his sincerity\u2019</h2> <p>Someone broke into our home and threw a pair of garden shears at my husband. I chose to do restorative justice because it was all we had. The offender didn\u2019t go to prison but was given a community order instead.<br></p> <p>I found this very hard to deal with and I couldn\u2019t cope with the injustice, I still can\u2019t. I didn\u2019t know what to do, I felt ignored and lost. When we were given this opportunity, I wanted to do it as I needed him to become a human being. To me he was a mystical figure, he was a horrible monster with no compassion. <br></p> <p>I didn\u2019t find it helpful though. The meeting itself was good and afterwards I felt very positive. About two hours after the meeting I fell into a pit of despair. I overthought his answers, I berated myself for forgetting to say things and I questioned his sincerity.<br></p> <p>Absolutely people should have access to restorative justice. It didn\u2019t work for me but I can see how it could for other people. I can imagine it being incredibly powerful. It should be an option for people to explore, but it needs to be looked at carefully as I think in some cases it could make things worse. Scenarios of domestic violence in particular are not appropriate for restorative justice, as the victim may feel obliged to accede to an offender\u2019s point of view without speaking up for themselves. <br></p> <p> Access to restorative justice should not be limited to region and should be made available as part of a global strategy to empower victims and rehabilitate offenders. </p> <p><em>Anonymous, South Wales</em> <br></p> <h2>\u2018I began to remember the raw beauty of life\u2019s paradox of love, of loss and of hope\u2019</h2> <p>My father was murdered in Toronto. Thirty years later, the man who put the bullet in his heart emailed me. We met. We spoke. We cried. We shared powerful healing. <br></p> <p>I wanted to come to know about the human who took the life of the human I loved. I wanted to know him, his reasons, his heart, our shared humanity. I wanted him to know me. I needed to have a voice and to hear his. <br></p> <p>I found the process helpful because I began to remember that I did not die when my dad was murdered. I began to remember the raw beauty of life\u2019s paradox of love, of loss, of hope, of compassion for my very self and for the man who pulled the trigger. We were both in hell. Meeting liberated us. We both knew we were loved and loving. Both human. <br></p> <p><em>Margot Van Sluytman, Canada </em></p> <h2>\u2018The system could not manage victims\u2019 anger and desire for restitution\u2019</h2> <p>As a member of the referral order team we would encourage offenders to consider the effects of their actions on the victims, and to respond to those people following the offence.</p> <p>I felt restorative justice would reduce the likelihood of further offending behaviour and give the victims of crime their day in court. It corrected the imbalance arising in the criminal justice system, which encouraged offenders to deny responsibility for their actions.</p> <p>The process, however, was not helpful. The youth offending service was very defensive and unable to really engage with victims. The system could not manage victims\u2019 anger and desire for restitution, leaving them vulnerable to being victimised further.<br></p> <p>Restorative justice is wonderful and should be more widely applied but it is a high-risk approach and victims may feel even more aggrieved if the system does not invest enough resources for the process to be performed effectively.

  "<p>There is a proxy war going on in the New South Wales Liberal party right now. It is about the party rules: who can join, how they join and what they get when they join.</p> <p>It is factional, in that the people generally who support \u201cdemocratisation\u201d of the rules tend to be on the right. The hotbed for this movement is in the Liberal heartland on the north shore and northern beaches of Sydney. </p> <p>Supporters of reform are generally more likely to support Tony Abbott than Malcolm Turnbull. The moderates, closer to the centre and more likely to support the current prime minister, are against the changes given the moderates already control the party\u2019s state executive. </p> <p>The right want to open up branch structures, establish plebiscites to give all members a say in the preselection of the local member and have even considered primary elections. Some support the principles, others think it will give them more power.</p> <p>While this issue does not begin and end with factions, that is the current prism through which it is seen. </p> <p>But the change has already occurred in all but one Liberal state and territory divisions of Australia. The former federal president John Valder called for plebiscites in 1983 and, after the Liberal defeat of John Hewson\u2019s Fightback in 1993, the ACT, Queensland and Tasmania changed their rules in 1994.

On Tuesday, he chose to speak to the Sydney Institute on this topic \u2013 not in a cursory, veiled way but in a strap-on-the-vest kind of way. (As if it had been neatly choreographed, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/sep/07/john-howard-urges-turnbull-and-baird-to-change-rules-of-nsw-liberal-party\">Howard backed in Taylor</a> in his National Press Club speech on Wednesday.) </p> <p>Taylor\u2019s charges against the NSW party include:</p> <ul> <li>people are regularly stopped from joining branches in order for powerbrokers to maintain control;<br></li> <li>people are regularly stopped from establishing branches for the same reason;<br></li> <li>as a result, the Liberal party is in danger of losing future elections and losing a valuable engagement with the community.</li> </ul> <p>He gave a concrete example of trying to establish a Cowra Liberal party branch \u2013 a site he chose because it was far from the \u201cbrutal\u201d internal factional battles of inner city Sydney. The state executive rejected the application, saying there was too much risk of another faction (centre right) coming in to stack the branch, take control of the numbers and thereby increase its power in state council. </p> <p>\u201cWhether you agree with party reform or not, I don\u2019t think anyone can seriously contest the proposition that the effect of all this is discourage some good Liberal supporters from joining the party,\u201d Taylor said.</p> <p>The moderates say that they need to control the party so they can get the best talent up, given ordinary party members tend to be more rightwing than the parliamentary party. This reflects the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2015/jul/23/bill-shorten-optimistic-labor-will-overhaul-longstanding-party-rules\">Labor reform</a> struggle, where the ordinary party membership tends to be more leftwing than the parliamentary party. </p> <p>But if that is the party \u2013 too left or too right \u2013 why not reflect it?

A British record transfer, this is supposed to be \u2026\u201d</p> <p>Clough, he said, starts crawling on his hands and knees to where his prospective new signing is sitting. \u201cAt this point\u201d \u2013 and Saunders makes this next remark in the manner of someone knowingly rolling his eyes \u2013 \u201cI started to work out he <em>might</em> be drunk.\u201d (Both presenters laugh.)</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/video/2016/sep/07/dean-saunders-recounts-version-meeting-brian-clough-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/522ax\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2698300\"            data-video-name=\"Dean Saunders gives his version of a meeting with Brian Clough \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"Talksport\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-57cfe272e4b0b2ee83375dee\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/09/07/160907clough_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/09/07/160907clough.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/09/07/160907clough_WebM.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/video/2016/sep/07/dean-saunders-recounts-version-meeting-brian-clough-video\">Dean Saunders gives his version of a meeting with Brian Clough</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>It turns out, perhaps for the benefit of his after-dinner audiences (Saunders gets \u00a31,000\u2013\u00a32,000 a pop, according to his online promoters at www.comedians.co.uk), Saunders is not just a fine raconteur but a budding impressionist.</p> <p>\u201cHe is crawling on the floor,\u201d he says. \u201cHe stops, looks at the carpet and goes: [Clough impersonation]: \u2018Hilly, I like your carpet, son, where did you get that from?\u2019</p> <p>\u2018Carpetright.\u2019</p> <p>[Clough impersonation]: \u2018How much?\u2019</p> <p>\u2018\u00a312.99 a square yard.\u2019</p> <p>[Clough impersonation]: \u2018My Barbara would love that carpet \u2013 good choice, Hilly, son.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Already, you get the idea that this is no ordinary anecdote. Yet we are only really warming up. \u201cIt goes on ages, this story,\u201d Saunders told us. \u201cIt\u2019s hilarious.\u201d Clough calls the agent \u201cfatso\u201d. He goes into the garden and, according to Saunders, takes one of the flower pots \u2013 \u201cthe best pot you\u2019ve ever seen with flowers spilling out\u201d \u2013 and rips out the entire lot to present to his prospective new signing. Then, one thing leading to another, Clough starts using the flowers as a pretend microphone, persuading Saunders to join him singing Chicago by Frank Sinatra.</p> <p>It is left to Archie Gemmill, according to Saunders, to make Forest\u2019s financial offer, hampered by regular Clough interruptions (strange in itself when Gemmill is only the first-team coach), and when the player finally gets home, head spinning, we get the killer line. Saunders finds his wife inside the door, with her finger to her lips, making a shush gesture. \u201cHe\u2019s only sat in my lounge,\u201d he says, \u201cwith the pot from the garden, and his arm around my mother-in-law. Honest to God \u2026\u201d</p> <p>Everyone in football, especially that era, seems to have a Clough story, but nothing perhaps quite as bonkers as this one \u2013 and I say that as someone who has written a couple of books about the man\u2019s work. It is also, I\u2019m pretty sure, the first time I can remember anyone telling an anecdote this way when it openly references, as a point of humour, the drinking and alcoholism that finished Clough \u2013 an illness some people (among them, TalkSport regular Ray Wilkins, presumably) call it. Sorry to be a dreadful spoilsport \u2013 I\u2019m fully aware I will be told to get a sense of humour, that it\u2019s banter and LOL \u2013 but I\u2019ve started to wonder whether Saunders might be a bit of a pillock.</p> <p>I do have my own drunk-Cloughie story. A year or so after Saunders left Derby (he eventually went to Liverpool), I was in my first job, at the Newark Advertiser, and Clough was invited to plant a tree to mark the opening of a local arts centre.</p> <p>This time, for the record, he was in a suit, not the green sweatshirt. Blotchy cheeks, though. Pissed again. Not exactly Clough in his pomp, with those piercing eyes, the immaculately coiffured hair, the healthy skin and all that precious, peculiar magic from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/oct/10/brian-clough-miracle-nottingham-forest-european-champions-film-jose-mourinho\" title=\"\">the days winning league titles and European Cups</a>.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/oct/10/brian-clough-miracle-nottingham-forest-european-champions-film-jose-mourinho\">Brian Clough and the miracle of Nottingham Forest</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Anyway, the tree. Most people would pop it in the ground, sprinkle a bit of mud on the roots and pat it down with a spade. Not Clough. He was down on his knees, flattening the soil with his bare hands, ruining a good suit. Nobody was laughing, though, and more fool me, perhaps, for not putting on a Clough accent over the years and trying to get some mileage out of it. It\u2019s just there are a thousand stories about this man that don\u2019t refer to him being plastered.</p> <p>He was the guy, remember, who once told a colleague: \u201cSinatra met me, you know,\u201d \u2013 and call me a spoilsport, humourless, whatever you will, those are the stories that make me laugh. Not ones about his blotchy cheeks or making an oaf of himself when he was sliding into alcoholism or maybe already there. Not stories I suspect that might have more topspin than a Roger Federer serve.</p> <p>I\u2019m in the minority, though. It\u2019s clearly fair game to go on the radio and tell jokey anecdotes about someone\u2019s drink problem. All the same I hope the Clough family \u2013 Nigel, Simon and Elizabeth, and their own children \u2013 weren\u2019t tuning in. I know what some of the players from Clough\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/apr/19/nottingham-forest-european-cup-hall-fame-brian-clough\" title=\"\">European Cup-winning teams</a> think about it and I put in a call to Hill this week.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a good after-dinner speech but unfortunately most of it isn\u2019t true,\u201d he told me. \u201cBrian wasn\u2019t drunk, he wasn\u2019t crawling on his hands and knees, he didn\u2019t sit facing a wall, he didn\u2019t mention the carpet once and there was no flowerpot \u2026 it just feels like he [Saunders] has put this story through a very imaginative scriptwriter and this is what they\u2019ve come up with.\u201d</p> <p>All rather awkward, I\u2019m sure you will agree. \u201cBrian liked a drink and we all know he had a situation towards the end but he wasn\u2019t drunk that day at all,\u201d Hill continued. \u201cHe didn\u2019t do the things that have been said and I\u2019ve no idea why he [Saunders] would say them.</p> <p>\u201cBrian arrived with Archie Gemmill. \u2018Hello, Mr Clough,\u2019 Saunders said. \u2018Son, call me Brian,\u2019 he replied. It was all perfectly normal. He didn\u2019t really want to speak to an agent, that\u2019s correct, and we were told it was going to be difficult because Saunders had already agreed a deal with Everton. \u2018It won\u2019t be difficult,\u2019 Brian told him, \u2018we\u2019ll just offer you more money than they have.\u2019 Then off he went up the garden to smell the lavender.</p> <p>\u201cWhen he\u2019d gone, Saunders told me Everton had offered him \u00a38,000. \u2018A month?\u2019 I asked. \u2018No, a week.\u2019 Crikey. I told Brian and his reaction was: \u2018Bloody hell, that\u2019s more than me, our Nigel and Pearcey get together.\u2019 First of all, though, he wanted me to do something. \u2018Smell this flower,\u2019 he said, \u2018it\u2019s beautiful.\u2019</p> <p>\u201cAfter half an hour Saunders said he would talk it through with his wife and went home. Then at 9pm he rang to say Liverpool had matched our offer and he would rather go there because his father used to play for them. So that\u2019s it. Brian wasn\u2019t drunk, and it\u2019s not fair. There are all sorts of different Brian Clough stories \u2013 I tell some myself, but not derogatory ones, not ones like this.\u201d</p> <p>Still, the damage is done. That eight\u2011minute clip \u2013 \u201cthe funniest thing that\u2019s ever happened to me in football\u201d, Saunders concludes \u2013 has gone viral. It is an internet sensation and the Liverpool Echo\u2019s headline on Monday was: \u201cHow a drunken Brian Clough tried to persuade Dean Saunders to turn down Howard Kendall.\u201d Even the Birmingham Evening Mail was running it. \u201cThe following anecdote has nothing to do with our clubs on this patch,\u201d the newspaper explained. \u201cHowever, it is quite possibly one of the best football stories we have heard in the past quarter of a century.\u201d Or, depending who you believe, one of the more ludicrous.</p> <p>Clough had taken his side to the FA Cup final that year, one of six Wembley visits in four seasons. He obviously rated Saunders \u2013 who has been informed that his story is disputed and chosen not to comment \u2013 but, for the most part, he did not need to break transfer records to improve his team. The year before, Clough found Roy Keane playing for Cobh Ramblers and signed him for \u00a347,000.</p> <p>As far as I\u2019m aware, Keane has never told a story, or embellished one, about Clough, with his drink-ravaged face, in that difficult period, 1991 to 1993, when the deterioration set in. Maybe it\u2019s true, as Keane once said, the game is full of bluffers.</p>",
  "<h2><strong>Are Washington now the standard bearer in the NFC East? </strong></h2> <p>There\u2019s nothing that captures the decline of the NFC East quite like pondering whether a Dan Snyder-run franchise is the best in the division. But after being the froth that rose to the top of the NFC East bowl last year at 9-7, Washington have made moves to try to win the division again.</p> <p>They picked up the biggest name in the offseason by signing former Panthers Pro Bowl cornerback and all-world trash talker Josh Norman. He\u2019ll help immensely improve a pass defense that was ranked 25th in the NFL last season, as will free agent safety David Bruton and early-round defensive back draft picks Su\u2019a Cravens and Kendall Fuller. On offense, Washington boast perhaps the division\u2019s most stable quarterback-coach combo in Kirk Cousins and Jay Gruden. Cousins had a breakout year in 2015 and rendered former franchise savior Robert Griffin III expendable, while Gruden went 9-7 and made the playoffs in his second year as a head coach. Compare that to the Eagles with Carson Wentz and Doug Pederson, the Giants with Eli Manning and unknown commodity Ben McAdoo, and the Cowboys with Tony Romo\u2019s carcass/Dak Prescott and Jason Garrett, the answer to the question: \u201cWho would Jeff Fisher be if he had red hair?\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2016/sep/06/nfc-west-preview-seattle-seahawks-los-angeles-rams-jared-goff\">NFC West preview: is No1 pick Jared Goff already a bust for the Rams?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Unless Cousins proves to be the latest Washington QB to have been a one-season wonder, the only thing that could keep Snyder\u2019s creation from the top of NFC East is the much more difficult schedule the team will face in 2016. While Washington got to feast on a last place schedule in 2015, this year they get the Cardinals and Panthers along with the AFC North and NFC North. It will be difficult to improve on 2015\u2019s 9-7 record. But in the NFC East, a repeat of last season could be enough to make Washington the division\u2019s first repeat winner since the Eagles controlled things from 2001 to 2004. And then the Giants, Cowboys and Eagles ownership will have to face the harsh reality of being worse than Snyder.</p> <h2><strong>Is Tony Romo\u2019s injury a blessing in disguise? </strong></h2> <p>The Cowboys entered training camp fancying themselves a Super Bowl contender because that\u2019s what Jerry Jones believes the team he\u2019s built is every year, 20-year periods with just two playoff wins total be damned. But few not wearing blue-tinted, star-framed glasses really saw the Cowboys as a championship threat this year even if Romo miraculously made it the entire year without once grabbing at his back or collarbone while prone on the field. The Cowboys were 4-12 last year, 1-7 at home and had the fourth-worst points differential in the entire NFL. They were not one healthy Romo away from lifting the Lombardi Trophy. And this season, in addition to missing Romo, the Cowboys will open without defensive players DeMarcus Lawrence, Randy Gregory and Rolando McClain due to suspension. Super Bowl favorites they are not. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2016/aug/31/nfc-north-preview-teddy-bridgewater-minnesota-vikings\">NFC North preview: are the Vikings doomed without Teddy Bridgewater?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>So while Romo being out again for six to 10 weeks is no one\u2019s definition of a good thing, the Cowboys could use his latest injury to lay the groundwork to become a good thing. Fourth round pick Dak Prescott showed promise in the preseason and he\u2019ll start the season at quarterback alongside fellow rookie Ezekiel Elliott, the team\u2019s first-round running back selection out of Ohio State. That\u2019s the start of a potentially exciting youth movement. Receivers Dez Bryant and Terrance Williams are still only in their mid-20s, too, meaning the Cowboys may have fallen into an offensive core that could be the face of the franchise for five years or more. Romo will be able to play again in October or November, but the Cowboys will have to decide if playing him is worth delaying a promising future for another run with a disappointing past. </p> <h2><strong>Can Ben McAdoo bring the Giants some consistency? </strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"641ed5ac7692cdbd0c29da06c465b0e13f423d17\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/641ed5ac7692cdbd0c29da06c465b0e13f423d17/0_297_5015_3009/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Eli Manning and Odell Beckham Jr talk tactics\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Eli Manning and Odell Beckham Jr talk tactics.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kevin Hoffman/USA Today Sports</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The Giants finally decided to get off the Tom Coughlin rollercoaster in January. After 12 seasons and two Super Bowl titles surrounded by disappointment and letdowns, the franchise moved on. What we don\u2019t yet know is if the Giants rollercoaster will continue with him gone. Maybe it was Eli Manning and the rest of the Giants veterans who were driving it all along, the true cause of every twist and turn and jaw-dropping fourth quarter defeat. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/30/afc-south-preview-andrew-luck-indianapolis-colts-nfl\">AFC South questions for 2016: can Andrew Luck drag the Colts to the postseason?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Onto the sideline grass Coughlin wore down with his incessant pacing steps Ben McAdoo, the team\u2019s offensive coordinator since 2014. He is credited with bringing some consistency to Manning\u2019s game over the last two years. The NFL\u2019s last remaining Manning had maybe his best overall season in 2015, yet the Giants still finished 6-10 and saw their coach forced out. So while Manning was to blame for some Giants collapses in years past, in 2015 it was the last-ranked defense that seemingly blew a fourth quarter lead in every loss. Here McAdoo chose consistency and retained defensive coordinator Steve Spagnuolo. He\u2019ll try to keep his job with a revamped defensive line featuring free agent acquisitions Olivier Vernon and Damon Harrison and the addition of first-round cornerback selection Eli Apple. The Giants don\u2019t need a worst-to-first performance from their defense; just a worst-to-21st will keep them in the mix in the NFC East. If that doesn\u2019t happen, McAdoo will be <a href=\"http://blacksportsonline.com/home/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/coughlin.jpg\">making Coughlin faces soon enough</a>.</p> <h2><strong>What are the Eagles doing? </strong></h2> <p>The Eagles and Browns are among the group of NFL franchises never to have won a Super Bowl. All ultimate failure is not created equal, however. While the Browns have long been a punchline, the Eagles have been more or less competitive for a generation. But Philadelphia are very much trending towards punchline status over the last year. <br></p> <p>After overreacting to Chip Kelly\u2019s first two semi-successful years on the job and handing him player personnel control, the Eagles overreacted again after the disastrous 2015 season and didn\u2019t simply bust him back to being head coach only, but canned him completely. Then, instead of bringing a young and exciting coach or a proven veteran winner, they decided to try to recreate the Andy Reid years by hiring longtime Reid deputy and former Eagles backup QB Doug Pederson. It was the generic brand vanilla ice cream of coaching hires and Pederson has done absolutely nothing since taking the job to build confidence that he can restore the \u201cglory\u201d of the Reid years or even reach the 10-6 heights that Kelly took the Eagles to twice. <br></p> <p>The journey into the NFL abyss continued at the draft when Philadelphia gave up a ransom to get the No2 overall pick so they could take quarterback Carson Wentz, who is about as far from a sure-thing as Philadelphia is from North Dakota. And now, after a preseason that saw Wentz struggle and get injured, the Eagles have traded Sam Bradford and handed Wentz the starting job \u2013 a job that will put him behind an offensive line without suspended tackle Lane Johnson, and surround him with skill position players lacking a single legitimate star to bail him out.</p> <p>Maybe Wentz has the talent and make-up to develop into a quality NFL quarterback if he\u2019s handled properly at the start of his career. But dropping him into week one with little help around him is putting him on a bust path. That\u2019s if he doesn\u2019t just get broken in half before his first NFL series ends. Unfortunately for Eagles fans, this season won\u2019t end soon enough.</p> <p><strong>Projected records: </strong><br></p> <p>1=) Washington: 9-7<br></p> <p>1=) Giants: 9-7</p> <p>3) Cowboys: 6-10</p> <p>4) Eagles: 3-13</p>",
  "<p>Last February, newspapers reported on the astonishing success of German toy manufacturer Playmobil\u2019s latest plastic figurine: <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Playmobil-6099-Martin-Luther-Reformation/dp/B00TKDX9LU\" title=\"\">a miniature Martin Luther</a> dressed in&#xa0;academic gown and floppy cap, holding a large quill pen and&#xa0;a copy of the Bible he famously translated into the vernacular.

Its stylised features and blank expression reflect the process of mythologisation that has transformed Luther into a symbol of the momentous religious movement that split 16th-century Christendom, at&#xa0;the cost of obscuring the reformer as a living, breathing human being.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.history.ox.ac.uk/faculty/staff/profile/roper\" title=\"\">Lyndal Roper</a>\u2019s new book is a compelling and provocative attempt to restore some flesh and blood to this static icon. It seeks to probe the interior life of a pioneering theologian who challenged the authority of the papacy and forged ideas about conscience and freedom that are still widely held to have set in motion transformations that shaped the modern world. Characterising Luther as a \u201cdifficult hero\u201d, she explores the paradoxes of his personality, and presents him as a fascinating, deeply flawed individual. For Roper, Luther\u2019s energy as a religious revolutionary sprang from his intense, often fractious relationships \u2013 products of the anger and arrogance, envy and hatred, crippling doubt and spiritual anxiety, humility and melancholy she uncovers from his correspondence and writings in German and Latin.</p> <p>Roper tells of a career littered with violent enmities and broken friendships with trusted associates, including Luther\u2019s mentor and confessor <a href=\"http://www.christianity.com/church/church-history/timeline/1501-1600/johann-von-staupitz-luthers-confessor-11629932.html\" title=\"\">Johann von Staupitz</a>, his radical colleague <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/biography/Andreas-Rudolf-Bodenstein-von-Carlstadt\" title=\"\">Andreas von Carlstadt</a>, and even his ally and successor in Wittenberg, <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/biography/Philipp-Melanchthon\" title=\"\">Philipp Melanchthon</a>. No one was immune to the vitriol and bile that poured from his mouth and his pen \u2013 he instantly denounced all those who crossed him as agents of Satan.</p> <p>Roper approaches her task as a feminist scholar, influenced by the social and cultural approaches to the early modern past that have flourished in academia over the past 20 years, and by the lively engagement with psychoanalysis that has been a hallmark of her work since the 1990s. She is conscious, however, of the controversial precedent set by the American psychoanalyst Erik&#xa0;Erikson in <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Young-Man-Luther-Psychoanalysis-Monograph/dp/0393310361\" title=\"\"><em>Young Man Luther</em></a><em> </em>(1958), a&#xa0;work of \u201cpsychohistory\u201d that many have since repudiated as anachronistic and reductionist.</p> <p>Like Erikson before her, she attaches considerable significance to Luther\u2019s troubled relationship with his father, Hans Luder, the metal worker and miner from Mansfeld, against whom he rebelled by entering the Augustinian order in Erfurt in 1505, instead of pursuing the career in law for which he was intended. This act of disobedience entailed \u201ca retreat from manhood into the matriarchal world\u201d of monastic piety, which Luther later rejected in favour of entering a new relationship with God, who alone had the capacity to redeem depraved humanity from the consequences of its original sin.</p> <p>For Roper, the Reformation involved a search for surrogate father figures and a vigorous reassertion of Luther\u2019s own masculinity. Although she insists his mother and siblings were also profoundly important in his intellectual and emotional development, the surviving sources do not allow her to excavate these relationships in the same detail.</p> <p>Her account also effects a notable shift of focus in identifying the core features of Luther\u2019s theology. Neither his startling claim that men and women are saved by faith alone, nor the doctrine of the predominant authority of the scriptures, is as significant in her eyes as his insistence on the real presence of Christ\u2019s body and blood in the Eucharist. This was the tenet to which he clung most fiercely in the face of the challenge presented by those who saw the sacrament as merely a memorial of the Last Supper and accused the Lutherans of defending a form of cannibalism, with the consequence that the embryonic Protestant movement began to fragment and divide fatally from within.</p> <p>Luther\u2019s uncompromising position on this issue, Roper argues, was a function of his renunciation of the asceticism that underpinned the vows he had taken as a monk. He was strikingly at ease with his own and others\u2019 corporeality, and revelled in scatological jokes and crude humour. He had an unusually positive and uninhibited attitude towards his body and to the pleasures of the flesh, above all sex. Paradoxically, this was a consequence of his conviction that human beings were utterly corrupt and addicted to sin: the counter to his gloomy Augustinian anthropology was a remarkably relaxed view of sexuality. It set Luther clearly apart from his contemporaries in ways that Roper perhaps does more to celebrate than to explain.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>He thought of women as 'baby machines' and married a former nun principally to spite his arch-enemy - the devil</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Indeed, Luther emerges from her book as a prophet of sexual liberation, whose flexible views are implicitly compared unfavourably with the \u201crule-bound communitarian moralism\u201d of the Swiss reformers and their heirs, including the puritanical killjoy <a href=\"http://www.christianitytoday.com/history/people/theologians/john-calvin.html\" title=\"\">John Calvin</a>. It may be this that makes Roper less exercised than might be expected about the notorious misogyny of a man whose works are saturated with sexist remarks, who thought of women as \u201cbaby machines\u201d, and who married the&#xa0;former nun, Katharina von Bora, principally to spite his arch-enemy, the&#xa0;devil. Although their relationship is examined in a central chapter that turns on the claim that marital union transformed Luther\u2019s theology, Katharina remains a peripheral figure, overshadowed by the personality of her husband, whose own swelling girth and heavy jowls were captured in portraits by <a href=\"http://lucascranach.org/\" title=\"\">Lucas Cranach</a> and other 16th-century painters.</p> <p>Like previous biographies, Roper\u2019s book dwells on the heady, contentious years between 1517 and 1531, and treats the increasingly bitter conflicts that marked the later part of his life more briefly. But she does not skimp on the subject of his virulent intolerance and his revulsion at the Jews (\u201cfilthy\u201d and \u201cexcremental\u201d). This found expression in some of his most repellent texts, which she quotes as evidence of&#xa0;the \u201cinner fantasies\u201d that propelled him, and of a streak of antisemitism that was integral to his outlook, rather than incidental.

  "<p>If you\u2019re experiencing a mental health issue, one of the people you probably least want to speak to about it is your employer. Disclosing depression or anxiety has long been seen as the last workplace taboo, for fear of repercussions. This is despite the existence of the <a href=\"http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2010/15/contents\" rel=\"nofollow\">Equality Act 2010</a>, which protects employees with physical and mental disabilities from discrimination. </p> <p>But just over a third of workers with a mental health condition discuss it with their employer, according to <a href=\"http://www.pmihealthgroup.co.uk/news/news-releases/only-a-third-of-mental-health-sufferers-talk-to-boss/\" rel=\"nofollow\">a survey of 1,388 employees</a> carried out by Willis PMI Group, one of the UK\u2019s largest providers of employee healthcare and risk management services. The research found that 30% of respondents were concerned that they wouldn\u2019t receive adequate support, 28% believed their employer wouldn\u2019t understand, and 23% feared that disclosing it would lead to management thinking less of them. </p> <p>A culture of fear and silence can have a huge impact on productivity \u2013 the charity Mind <a href=\"https://www.mind.org.uk/media/1690126/weve_got_work_to_do.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">estimates</a> [pdf] that mental ill health costs the economy \u00a370bn a year. The challenge is that seeking help involves taking ownership of the problem, says Mark Brown, development director of social enterprise <a href=\"http://socialspider.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Social Spider</a> and founder of the now defunct mental health and wellbeing magazine One in Four. And finding support online can be a time-consuming and frustrating experience. </p> <p>\u201cJust serving up ever great slabs of information \u2013 the internet is awash with it \u2013 isn\u2019t going to help anyone to know what to do,\u201d says Brown. \u201cWe often confuse the provision of information with the solving of problems. Knowing information is different from knowing how to put that information into action.\u201d</p> <p>Brown believes that bringing together information with public and open data into a single digital space is one way that could innovate how advice is delivered.</p> <p><a href=\"https://plexus.support\" rel=\"nofollow\">Plexus</a> is aiming to achieve just this. Built by the digital studio <a href=\"https://madebyma.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">M/A</a>, with funding from the Open Data Institute, the knowledge base is being used to design resources for people with mental health conditions, their families, and even employers, to find support available in local areas, seek advice on how best to cope with returning to work after a period off and understand employee rights and employer responsibilities. </p> <p>Plexus has pooled data from a couple of dozen organisations including NHS Choices, Department for Work and Pensions, the Office for National Statistics and Citizens Advice. In some cases the information has been pulled from APIs; in other instances it has been scraped using web data platform <a href=\"https://www.import.io/\" rel=\"nofollow\">import.io</a>. </p> <p>The first tool Plexus developed is a chatbot called Grace, which is currently in beta testing. It enables users to record thoughts and feelings anonymously, receive feedback in the form of a newsletter and log in to an online dashboard to see a more detailed analysis, including whether there are any patterns in mood emerging over a period of time. The tool also offers guidance from the various governmental and charity websites under easy-to-navigate sections, such as legal rights and preparing for work.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media-network/2016/aug/19/apps-for-democracy-open-data-and-the-future-of-politics\">Apps for democracy \u2013 open data and the future of politics</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cThrough machine learning, Grace will intuitively know when our users are mostly likely to want to speak with us, be able to see the positive and negative nature of the user\u2019s reply, and adapt the questions to encourage more positive responses,\u201d explains Martin Vowles, creative director and co-founder of M/A. \u201cWe\u2019re hoping this approach will allow us to offer a unique tool to each user which helps them understand and develop their mental wellbeing.\u201d</p> <p>Brown says that the potential for machine learning to tailor information and services is exciting. \u201cIt\u2019s very good at looking at big piles of data for patterns. When we know certain things to be correct from one dataset, it can begin to make guesses about lots of other things based on what the machine is being fed.\u201d</p> <p>The sensitive nature of data being submitted by users on a platform like Grace, though, means many people are likely to be uneasy about their data being made accessible. To get round this, Plexus allows users to decide how their data is shared, with data licences lasting between 13 and 26 weeks. Vowles hopes that \u201cas users become more trusting of Grace and what it can do for them, they\u2019ll become more trusting with [us] using their anonymised personal data.\u201d</p> <p>Plexus aims to release a series of open datasets, including qualitative, quantitative and information on resources accessed by Grace users, to enable NGOs and local authorities to understand the country\u2019s mental health provision. It\u2019s hoped that they\u2019d then use the knowledge to devise new strategies and ensure targets are met and resources and services available in local areas are of an acceptable standard. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media-network/2016/aug/11/open-data-empowers-citizen-know-the-law\">How open data helps citizens to know the law</a> </p> </aside>  <p>There are also plans to make certain data available to employers, but \u201cthis has to be on the employee\u2019s terms\u201d. Vowles imagines that involving employers in the process of receiving support could allow them to get a clearer picture of mental health in the workplace. They could then adapt to make employees feel more comfortable and ensure their business has adequate support in place.</p> <p>The potential to use open data to shape how future mental health support is delivered is an area that has been underexplored. At the end of last year, the Royal Society of Arts launched <a href=\"https://www.thersa.org/action-and-research/rsa-projects/public-services-and-communities-folder/mental-health/long-life.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">an interactive platform</a> with Mind that allows members of the public to find out how well local health providers are looking after people with mental health conditions. The full dataset is available to download and includes data extracted from Public Health England, as well as metrics such as percentage of people with a mental health condition in employment in local areas. Plexus, however, is the first tool to use open data with the aim of providing people with a holistic view of their mental wellbeing. </p> <p>Brown supports the idea of using open datasets and combine them, but stresses that any tool or platform has to benefit users. The data and information must be digestible and it needs to help them understand and take away from it what they need.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s often extremely easy to forget that people with mental health difficulties are people first and foremost \u2013 not objects or problems.\u201d</p> <p><strong><em>To get weekly news analysis, job alerts and event notifications direct to your inbox, </em></strong><a href=\"https://register.theguardian.com/media/\"><strong><em>sign up free for Media &amp; Tech Network membership</em></strong></a><strong><em>.</em></strong><br></p> <p><em>All Guardian Media &amp; Tech Network content is editorially independent except for pieces labelled \u201cPaid for by\u201d \u2013 find out more </em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sponsored-content\"><em>here</em></a><em>.</em></p>",

Kuala Lumpur is 6,611km northwest.</p> <p>According to a report by the <a href=\"http://www.atsb.gov.au/publications/investigation_reports/2015/aair/ao-2015-029/\">Australian Transport Safety Bureau</a> (ATSB) published on Wednesday, the problem occurred when faulty earmuffs prompted the captain and first officer to swap their usual pre-flight checks.</p> <p>Ordinarily, the report said, the captain would conduct an external inspection of the plane while the first officer stayed in the cockpit and, among other tasks, completed the position initialisation and alignment procedures.</p> <p>On this day, however, the captain\u2019s ear protection was not available so he took over the cockpit tasks, which included entering their current coordinates, usually given as the coordinates of the departure gate, into the plane\u2019s internal navigation system. </p> <p>The report said that the captain manually copied the coordinates from a sign outside the cockpit window into the system, and that later analysis showed a \u201cdata entry error\u201d.</p> <p>Instead of entering the longitude as 151\u00b0 9.8\u2019 east, or 15109.8 in the system, he incorrectly entered it as 15\u00b0 19.8\u2019 east, or 01519.8. </p> <p>\u201cThis resulted in a positional error in excess of 11,000km, which adversely affected the aircraft\u2019s navigation systems and some alerting systems,\u201d the ATSB said.</p> <p>The report said the crew had \u201ca number of opportunities to identify and correct the error\u201d but did not notice it until they had become airborne and started to track in the wrong direction.</p> <p>Those opportunities included a flag or message that flashed up on the captain\u2019s screen during crosscheck of the cockpit preparations, which the first officer later told ATSB investigators he had seen but not mentioned because it was \u201ctoo quick to interpret\u201d; and three separate chimes which, because they were not accompanied by a message from the computer, were ignored.</p> <p>A fifth sign that something was wrong came in the form of an alert blaring: \u201cTERRAIN! TERRAIN!\u201d This was not ignored \u2013 both pilots said it had \u201cstartled\u201d them.

  "<p>Politics is not meant to be&#xa0;fun. Convention demands that politicians depict their work as a pious vocation, rewarding only to the extent that public service is its own remuneration. Voters tend towards the opposite view, imagining MPs in a state of constant money-grubbing machination, getting icy thrills from power and corruption.</p> <p>So when Ed Balls describes meeting Dolly Parton as one of the highlights of his career or admits that travel to exotic locations was a perk of ministerial summits, it feels as if he is spilling a&#xa0;banal yet well-kept trade secret: politicians sometimes get a childlike kick out of their jobs because they get to do cool stuff that, as children, they never imagined they might do.</p> <p>And anyone who watched Balls jiggling in a tightly focused frenzy on his <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/gallery/2016/aug/31/ed-balls-strictly-come-dancing-in-pictures\" title=\"\"><em>Strictly Come Dancing </em>debut</a> last weekend could see in that sturdy 49-year-old man the visual echo of a&#xa0;boy. It is the child, equal parts self\u2011conscious and attention-seeking, rattling around in the frame of a heavyweight politician, that makes <em>Speaking Out</em> more intriguing than many political memoirs. We meet him&#xa0;playing football alone, winning imaginary FA Cups in his back garden. There is a glimpse of him at school, weathering taunts about his surname, his skin thickening, his confidence crystallising, shiny but brittle.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/02/ed-balls-interview-speaking-out-memoir-labour-blair-brown\">Ed Balls: \u2018Yvette thought it was easier for me to have a midlife crisis than her\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The book mostly covers the adventures of a more familiar Balls, lieutenant to Gordon Brown in government and bellower of unheard economic arguments at George Osborne in opposition. The story is told not chronologically but as a series of thematic questions, pegged to dilemmas from the author\u2019s 21-year career. The competition between caution and risk-taking, for example, is&#xa0;illuminated by the Brown team\u2019s bungled handling of a snap election that was mooted and aborted in 2007. The question of how to navigate between level-headed calculation and emotional urgency is explored from the desk of a cabinet minister reading the horrific case file of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/baby-p\" title=\"\">Baby P</a>. A recurrent motif is&#xa0;the tension between a politician\u2019s instinct to assume control and the inevitability of its surrender, whether in designing financial regulation or trying&#xa0;to have a family life free from media intrusion.</p> <p>Like all political memoirists, Balls awards himself ample benefit of the doubt when it comes to the big judgments. He owns up to many micro-mistakes, but anyone hoping for&#xa0;a recantation on macroeconomics before or after the financial crisis will be disappointed. He is loyal to Brown. References to his mentor\u2019s notorious temper are euphemistic. Perhaps surprisingly, given the famous feud that consumed so much energy at the height of the New Labour era, Balls also treads delicately around Tony Blair, whose judgment he obviously respects. The same cannot be said of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/aug/29/ed-balls-labour-did-not-deserve-to-win-election-ed-miliband\" title=\"\">Ed Miliband</a>, who is depicted as a weak leader, playing a difficult hand badly.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Balls is not afraid to admit weakness, at least not any more</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>There is humility to compensate for the passages of shifty self-exculpation. Balls is not afraid to admit weakness, at&#xa0;least not any more. He cannot deny that warning signs of financial calamity in the run-up to the great crash were missed. Instead, he uses that lapse as&#xa0;the basis for a rumination on the importance of interrogating received wisdom and the perilous temptation for politicians to dismiss as unthinkable the things that they would rather not think about. That, he argues, is how pro-Europeans missed early warnings of Britain\u2019s march towards <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/eu-referendum\" title=\"\">Brexit</a> and why veterans of New Labour fatally underestimated the appeal of Jeremy Corbyn to their party\u2019s demoralised activist core.</p> <p>Balls is refreshingly ready to use the&#xa0;word \u201cfailure\u201d for a career that ended before reaching his coveted destination. He thought he had a chance of becoming chancellor, until election night in May 2015. The book begins in self-deprecatory mode with Balls in shock, unexpectedly ousted from his <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2015/may/08/ed-balls-loses-seat-morley-outwood-labour-general-election-2015-video\" title=\"\">parliamentary seat</a> that night, toasting the death of his political persona at a mock wake with&#xa0;close aides.</p> <p>The defeat was bereavement, but grief gave way to acceptance. Cynics will see Balls\u2019s sudden reinvention as&#xa0;a&#xa0;TV personality \u2013 cooking on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2015/dec/11/samantha-cameron-and-ed-balls-to-mix-it-up-in-great-british-bake-off-special\" title=\"\"><em>The Great&#xa0;Comic Relief Bake Off</em></a>; donning the <em>Strictly</em> sequins \u2013 as another political campaign, a ruse to pursue the old dogged ambition by other means. Same programme, different channel. But <em>Speaking Out</em> feels much more like the obituary for an old life than a manifesto for a new one.</p> <p>Besides, authenticity is hard to fake and Balls was never much good at spin. He was reputedly a clever economist and crafty behind-the-scenes operator, but even his staunchest allies would concede that he struggled with the performance aspect of politics. His best speeches were noted for analytical rigour, not theatrical flourish. His worst ones, the haranguing responses to Osborne\u2019s autumn statements, are engraved in the annals of parliamentary self-destruction.</p> <p>The root of the problem was an interiorised stammer \u2013 a condition that&#xa0;manifests itself in sudden verbal freezes, inaudible on the outside, but panic-inducing on the inside. The chapter dealing with Balls\u2019s late realisation that his problem even had a name \u2013 he was a cabinet minister before it was diagnosed \u2013 his initial reluctance to get treatment and subsequent decision to go public, is compelling and&#xa0;affecting. Acknowledgment of the&#xa0;stammer begins a narrative thread that reconciles Balls the attack dog of Westminster legend and hate figure for&#xa0;the Tories (and, latterly, Corbyn supporters) with Balls the husband, parent, amateur pianist, fanatical Norwich City supporter, karaoke enthusiast and human being.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Moderates end up cast as soulless automatons. Mavericks and charlatans are lauded for their characterful originality</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>One of the book\u2019s dispiriting conclusions is that the functions of personality and professionalism in modern politics are diverging. Moderates and pragmatists end up cast as soulless, unprincipled automatons. Mavericks, extremists and charlatans \u2013 those who are unconstrained by consideration of what might actually work in government \u2013 are lauded for their characterful originality. That observation sits alongside a drier argument about the need to update and re-energise \u201cthird-way\u201d politics. He urges governments to confront the systemic flaws in a globalised capitalist economy that have fed insurgencies of&#xa0;the nationalist right and Marxist left.&#xa0;Balls\u2019s suggestion that&#xa0;well-run businesses and properly regulated markets should be seen as part of the economic solution, not the problem, is so unfashionable in Labour these days, it feels almost as incongruous as his dance moves.</p> <p>But the point of <em>Speaking Out</em> is not to fit in. Democratic politics are governed by the contradictory duty to do unpopular things and the need to be&#xa0;popular. Political memoirs end up similarly caught between the reader\u2019s appetite for unvarnished truth and the&#xa0;author\u2019s self-censoring reflex. Balls&#xa0;does not entirely escape that conundrum, but he comes closer than&#xa0;many. Much of the dialogue, for&#xa0;example, supposedly recalled verbatim, seems sticky with retrospective varnish. Rather, it is Balls\u2019s frustration at what might have been said but was not \u2013 partly because the words wouldn\u2019t always flow, but more because modern politics can be so unforgiving of candour \u2013 that has the poignant ring of truth.</p> <p>\u2022 To order <em>Speaking Out</em> (Cornerstone, RRP \u00a320) for \u00a316.40 go to <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/speaking-out.html?utm_source=editoriallink&amp;utm_medium=merch&amp;utm_campaign=article\" title=\"\">bookshop.theguardian.com</a> or call 0330 333 6846.

Situated on Waitemata harbour, bordered by golden beaches on either side, with a sub-tropical climate and 2,003 sunshine hours a year.</p> <p>Auckland also attracts New Zealanders wanting to experience a little of the glamour of an international city without having to relocate to Sydney, London or Singapore.<br></p> <p>For minority ethnic groups, Auckland is big enough to have a vibrant and diverse dining, arts and culture scene. It is also the largest Pacific city in the world, and home to the most M\u0101ori in the country.</p> <p>Immigration to New Zealand is also at record highs (69,000 in the year to July) meaning more homes are needed \u2013 fast.<br></p> <h2><strong>So who owns these properties? </strong></h2> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/17/new-zealand-housing-crisis-forces-hundreds-to-live-in-garages-tents-and-cars\">New Zealand housing crisis forces hundreds to live in tents and garages</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Increasingly, not New Zealanders.

NZ$5 for a regular latte in town is standard. A public bus from the central city to South Auckland (a distance of 17km, or 10 just over miles) costs NZ$6-9 one-way, and takes between 45-90 minutes. A commuter ferry that takes 10 minutes to cross the harbour costs NZ$6.20 one way.

  "<p>No matter how successful your small business, no owner has all the answers. But knowing when to look for outside help \u2013 and who from \u2013 is a challenge in itself. We spoke to four business owners whose coaches and mentors gave their business a leg up.<br></p> <h2>Take a step back </h2> <p>\u201cSmall business owners often don\u2019t spend enough time thinking about where their business is going, as opposed to the urgency of the day job,\u201d says Andy Mee, a \u201cbusiness doctor\u201d covering the Oxfordshire area. Entrepreneurs need to spend more time working on their business, not in it, he says.<br></p> <p>This was one of the lessons for Anthony Stiff, a landscape architect who\u2019s been working with Mee for 18 months. \u201cDuring the recession, for maybe five years, we survived but it wasn\u2019t the happiest time. We thought we\u2019ve got to do something positive and grow the business, and this was a way we could do that,\u201d he says. <br></p> <p>One lesson Stiff has taken away from Mee is to make time for the \u201cgolden hour\u201d. \u201cSo on a Monday morning or Friday afternoon you should spend an hour looking at your business and reviewing the week that\u2019s just gone by and planning the week ahead [...] Just being conscious of the goal that you set yourself. It\u2019s very easy to lose sight of that.\u201d<br></p> <h2>Build your confidence </h2> <p>Whether or not you have a team around you, running your own business can be lonely. There is no one to turn to when the chips are down or to reassure you that you are on the right path. <strong><br></strong></p> <p>For Nila Holden, who runs a luxury biscuit wholesaler, a mentor provided reassurance that she was doing the right things for her business. Holden was coached by Jo Densley, founder of Relish Marketing, over several months looking at potential markets, which to launch into and what that required.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/small-business-network/2016/jul/29/funerals-failed-startups-entrepreneurs-rise-ashes\">Funerals for failed startups that allow entrepreneurs to rise from the ashes</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cI have my aspirations for the business; I think about the sorts of places where we should be selling and the partners we should be working with. But I never had the confidence to do those things.\u201d Holden thought her ambitions were just pipe dreams, but having a mentor tell her they were realistic goals gave her the confidence to take the business forward. </p> <p>According to Mee, helping small and medium-sized business owners see where their businesses can go is a big part of consultancy. \u201cWe try and make [business owners] see what the opportunities are for their business. You become pre-conditioned by what\u2019s happened in the past, not what can happen in the future,\u201d he says. </p> <h2>Change your outlook </h2> <p>Like many small business owners, journalist Natasha Courtenay-Smith found herself running a small business by accident. In 2008 she launched an online press agency, Talk to the Press, selling exclusive news stories and real life features to national papers and magazines: \u201cMaybe because my background wasn\u2019t business, I didn\u2019t massively grasp I was running a business,\u201d she says. <strong><br></strong></p> <p>She began working with a mentor after winning a spot at James Caan\u2019s Entrepreneurs\u2019 Business Academy and, for her, the greatest benefit was changing how she thought about her company. \u201cIt completely shifted how I looked at Talk to the Press,\u201d she says. \u201cIt gave me the vocabulary and everything I needed to understand that it was an asset and it had value.\u201d <br></p> <p>Understanding her business\u2019s value quickly led Courtenay-Smith to think about the potential for selling it, which she did in 2014. \u201cI don\u2019t think actually in the process of working with [my mentor] we started packaging it up for sale, I did that myself. But it did give me all the vocabulary and the understanding I needed so that when I came to sale I knew how to make it look really compelling.\u201d <br></p> <h2> Focus your business </h2> <p>From identifying new markets to turning your attention to your most profitable product or customer base, the objective view of a business mentor can be just what\u2019s needed to get your company out of a rut or take it to the next level. <strong><br></strong></p> <p>Nila Holden says her work with mentors was invaluable in turning her kitchen table baking business into a commercial wholesale venture. Through working with a mentor from the Design Trust Holden decided to focus on baking biscuits. \u201cIf you\u2019re creative and you\u2019re online, to have a really good business model you need to have a niche,\u201d she says. \u201cI never really understood that until I did that piece of work.\u201d </p> <p>Not long after she specialised, Holden received an inquiry from Fortnum &amp; Mason for a Valentine\u2019s day range. \u201cIt\u2019s really tempting to want to do anything and everything. But I know now, when biscuits comes up people look us up because that\u2019s what we\u2019ve become known for,\u201d she says. <br></p> <h2>Make marginal gains </h2> <p>Like Team GB\u2019s world-beating track cycling team, success in business is often about making incremental improvements across the board.

Their capability is questioned \u2013 can she cook? can she raise children? \u2013 along with their sexuality and entitlement to equity or rights. If they fail to meet idealised expectations about how a woman\u2019s body should look, they are deemed incapable of providing care. </p> <p>Sadly, this view of women with disabilities being \u201cbroken\u201d or of less value has been adopted by the women\u2019s rights movement, which has been slow to make space for them \u2013 if not actively resistant.</p> <p>This is hard to understand. Women with disabilities could be the fulcrum of the women\u2019s rights movement. The challenges they face surrounding identity, beauty and duty of care are all issues firmly on the women\u2019s rights agenda. </p> <p>A female friend said recently over lunch: \u201cThank God for the technology which screens disabled foetuses \u2013 it is so easy to get rid of them.\u201d When I objected, I was told it is a woman\u2019s choice whether she \u201cwants a disabled kid\u201d. It is interesting how the discourse of choice and agency is perceived when it intertwines with disability.</p> <p>In countries that allow abortion, disability is often deemed justification for the process. This has put women\u2019s and reproductive rights movements at loggerheads with disability rights groups. The former claim women have the right to make a choice. The latter say such abortions are an exercise in eugenics, reasserting the myths and perpetuating stigma surrounding people with disabilities.</p> <p>Instead of working to create structural and systemic support, such as access to education, employment and public spaces, and reducing barriers for disabled people and their families, the approach is to prevent the birth of children with disabilities in the first place. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>If an able-bodied woman were subject to forced abortion or sterilisation, the women\u2019s rights movement would contest it</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Consequently, health and women\u2019s rights activists find it extremely difficult when a virus like Zika surfaces, because we are bombarded with messages about the \u201cdevastating\u201d impact of foetal abnormalities, instead of talking about better support. It is a shame foetuses with disabilities are used by the pro-choice groups to open up discussion about abortion rights, while also being used by pro-life groups to push their agenda of expanding abortion bans \u2013 a political game in which disability rights lose.</p> <p>Unfortunately, women with disabilities are often unable to exercise their bodily, reproductive and childcare rights. In a famous case in India, a woman with a learning disability was raped, became pregnant and wanted to have the baby. But the <a href=\"http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chandigarh/High-court-rules-in-favour-of-abortion/articleshow/4791169.cms\">legal system</a> opposed her right to make that choice. Only disability rights activists fought for her.</p> <p>In Colombia, the <a href=\"http://www.womenenabled.org/pdfs/Columbia%20Press%20Release%20Sterilization%20%20of%20People%20with%20Disabilities%20Eng%20March%2018%202014.docx\">constitutional courts</a> (pdf) ruled that girls with disabilities could be forcibly sterilised, arguing they lacked the mental capacity to make reproductive decisions or protect themselves from unwanted pregnancy arising from sexual abuse.

They will dominate and form the backdrop to many of the speeches and debates at the <a href=\"https://www.england.nhs.uk/expo/\" title=\"\">NHS Expo in Manchester </a>today and tomorrow. From an NHS point of view, they absolutely have to succeed. However, to do so, these microcosms of the <a href=\"https://www.england.nhs.uk/ourwork/futurenhs/\" title=\"\">NHS Five Year Forward View survival masterplan from 2014 </a>must overcome a daunting array of very difficult obstacles.</p> <p>Back in March, the NHS England chief executive, Simon Stevens, outlined the importance of STPs when he declared that: \u201c<a href=\"https://www.england.nhs.uk/2016/03/footprint-areas/\" title=\"\">Now is the time to confront \u2013 not duck \u2013 the big local choices needed to improve health and care across England</a> over the next five years, and STPs are a way of doing this. Their success will largely depend on the extent to which local leaders and communities now come together to tackle deep-seated and longstanding challenges that require shared cross-organisational action.\u201d</p> <p>Six months on, England has been divided into 44 STP \u201cfootprints\u201d. Each is a collaboration between all the statutory bodies in that area involved in health and social care \u2013 such as NHS trusts and clinical commissioning groups, and local councils, which fund social care. NHS England describes them as \u201ccollective discussion forums\u201d and Stevens sees them as evidence of unprecedented cooperation between organisations which historically have done their own thing.</p> <p>In the Lancashire and South Cumbria STP, for example, there are 31 different statutory bodies \u2014 nine clinical commissioning groups (CCGs), six NHS provider trusts, four upper-tier local authorities and 12 district councils. It is led by Dr Amanda Doyle, a GP who is also the chief clinical officer of Blackpool CCG. Its discussions also involve voluntary organisations, four local Healthwatch branches and several local committees, which represent GPs.</p> <p>\u201cWe have three aims. Firstly, to improve the health of the population. On our patch we have some of the poorest health and shortest life expectancy in the country. Secondly, to improve the outcomes of care. Some of those outcomes could be improved if care was delivered in a different way, for example, if more stroke or cancer patients were treated in specialist centres,\u201d says Doyle. \u201cAnd thirdly, to make our bit of the system more financially sustainable. Although we\u2019ve had extra investment, rising demand is outstripping that, so we need to make our population healthier so that we can in some way control the demands they put on the healthcare system.\u201d</p> <p>Doyle, like other STP advocates, is clear that achieving these objectives will involve big changes to the way NHS services are organised, and care delivered. She admits that a reorganisation of hospital services will be part of that. \u201cIt could also mean looking at the number of sites on which we do certain things and rationalising some of that. We are starting to look at all of our services to see if they are in the right place or whether we are duplicating efforts.\u201d The local NHS\u2019s inability to recruit enough staff to work in every department of all four of the STP\u2019s acute hospital trusts \u2013 especially in A&amp;E, dermatology and radiology \u2013 will mean fewer centres in key areas of care, she hints.</p> <p>But will rationalisation necessarily help the NHS make the \u00a322bn of savings it has to deliver by 2020? \u201cThere are concerns that some areas are focusing on plans to reorganise acute hospital services, despite evidence that major reconfigurations of hospital services rarely save money and do not necessarily improve care,\u201d says Chris Ham, chief executive of the King\u2019s Fund thinktank. Plans in some STPs to reduce the number of hospital beds are also unlikely to succeed, he believes. Nigel Edwards, his counterpart at the Nuffield Trust thinktank, says: \u201cI\u2019ve been visiting a lot of STPs and nobody I\u2019ve spoken to is confident they can reduce the financial gap. One insider said to me: \u2018Optimism bias abounds\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>Ham adds: \u201cIt would be a huge shame if a vital opportunity to improve services for patients is derailed by bruising rows about ill-conceived hospital closures.\u201d Colin Crilly, a spokesman for the Keep Our St Helier Hospital campaign group in south-west London, speaks for grassroots NHS campaigners who are profoundly worried by the emerging details of how STPs could affect hospitals. \u201dWith the government\u2019s annual budget [for the NHS] shrinking in real terms, the NHS is facing huge debts. STP is a quick plan to get rid of these debts by getting rid of services, wards or hospitals.\u201d.STPs are odd entities, as Edwards points out. \u201cThey\u2019re not organisations. They\u2019re \u2018footprints\u2019 \u2014 lines on maps. There\u2019s no building with a name on the door.\u201d</p> <p>It is unusal to find what are in effect high-level talking-shops expected to tackle the biggest problems in the NHS and then agree push through changes that no one pretends will be popular. The fact that they are non-statutory bodies and have no formal power \u2013 and, crucially, their reliance on reaching agreement among bodies with sometimes different agendas \u2013 could yet prove a flaw, adds Edwards. What happens if a hospital that is set to lose a much-loved A&amp;E or maternity unit as a result of an STP decides to go to court to thwart it? The cooperation vital to the whole programme would disappear.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/aug/26/the-nhs-secret-is-out-local-communities-wont-like-it\">The NHS secret is out. And local communities won't like it</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Perhaps the biggest risk, though, is that while the NHS has talked for years about building up <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/healthcare-network/2015/oct/15/community-services-must-speak-out-future-nhs\" title=\"\">out-of-hospital services</a>, little progress has been made, as acute hospitals have received an ever-bigger slice of the cake. NHS England say that general practice, mental health and community-based services will get more and more of the cake in coming years. But will it be enough to cope with the planned massive shift of care into places that are as yet undefined and unfunded, and will there be enough staff there, in or closer to people\u2019s homes, to enable that?</p> <p>Doyle admits that, while general practice will need to expand its role, \u201cGPs are already busy, that\u2019s their trouble.\u201d But she points to innovation in out-of-hospital care, such as last year\u2019s introduction on the Fylde coast, in Lancashire, of \u201cwellbeing support workers\u201d, who try to keep frail elderly people as well as possible at home, to reduce their risk of hospital admission. STPs are looking to replicate good ideas like that everywhere.</p> <p>The stakes could not be higher. So will STPs save the NHS?</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s absolutely vital that they succeed. We have to have a sustainable NHS and to do that we have to adapt how we do things,\u201d says Doyle.</p> <p>Jim Mackey, chief executive of the financial regulator NHS Improvement, says there is no option. NHS bodies need \u201cto work together, to think boldly and to work out how change \u2014 no matter how radical \u2014 can best be achieved to meet the major challenges we face,\u201d he says.</p> <p>Despite all the dramatic rhetoric about STPs, Edwards remains sceptical. \u201cThere are a significant number of risks associated with them and the jury is still out as to whether they are going to work or not,\u201d he points out. \u201c It\u2019s too early to say.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>The best mobile game in the world is Tinder. It has a blissfully intuitive control scheme and, if you win, you make an actual emotional connection with a real-life human being, and maybe find happiness for the rest of your life. That\u2019s a pretty strong deal.</p> <p>Aside from the chance of emotional (or maybe purely physical) satisfaction, that simple swiping control scheme is perfect for one-handed mobile operation. It reduces the entirety of the app to a series of simple binary choices on single screens of information. It\u2019s surprising that so few actual games have taken inspiration from it.</p> <p>Reigns aims to change that. The game puts you in the role of a king \u2013 a dynasty of kings, really \u2013 ruling your kingdom with the help of a number of advisors. Each year, one comes to you with a suggestion \u2013 \u201cBuild a church!\u201d, \u201cInvade your neighbours!\u201d, \u201cFeed the starving\u201d, that kind of thing \u2013 and you get the chance to swipe right or left. That\u2019s yes or no, in case you\u2019ve not fooled around on the dating app before.</p> <p>The suggestions affect four metrics by which your success is measured: wealth, military strength, popularity, and\u2026 churchiness? You fail if any of these metrics gets too low or too high. Too much wealth, and you have a huge feast and choke to death; too little churchiness and the clergy tries to have you executed, Faith Militant-style.</p> <p>Death isn\u2019t the end, though. If your king dies, you quickly come back as his heir, and the pattern repeats.</p> <p>As you can imagine from a game about binary choices, there isn\u2019t a huge amount of depth. By and large, you\u2019ll be vaguely picking the choices that look like they\u2019ll keep each value somewhere in the middle of its respective bar.</p> <p>Worryingly, it\u2019s often possible to do fairly well \u2013 measured by your king\u2019s lifespan \u2013 simply by swiping in the same direction a lot. Deliberately trying to balance the values also doesn\u2019t always work, as the randomness of your available options can lead you into no-win situations fairly often.</p> <p>But Reigns isn\u2019t a hardcore strategy game. It\u2019s whimsical and charming, with a sweet sense of humour and nice art direction. If you die, the idea is that you should just get up and carry on.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Reigns game\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://uploads.guim.co.uk/2016/09/06/Reigns.gif&quot; title=&quot;source: Nerial.com&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot;/&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> <figcaption>Swipe left or right and hope for the best.</figcaption> </figure>  <p>Unfortunately, some aspects of the game make it hard to fully revel in that charm. Worst are the times the game simply offers nonsensical choices, where it\u2019s not clear what you are agreeing to or what its effect should be.</p> <p>\u201cA group of fanatics have ransacked the hospital, pretending only God can heal them through your holy touch, My Lord\u201d, reads one card from your Bard, William Writhe.</p> <p>Your available responses are simply \u201cYes\u201d or \u201cNo\u201d, which don\u2019t make any sense in response to the statement. And both responses affect the same three qualities. You quite literally may as well toss a coin, unless you\u2019ve seen the card before and memorised its contents.</p> <p>Feats of memory are perfectly possible, because even though the game promises 400 unique cards, you will see a <em>lot</em> of them multiple times. That\u2019s fine when you\u2019re simply trying to set a high score. But as the game\u2019s story-arc comes into play, featuring a demonic curse passed down through the generations, and an achievement-style system, you\u2019ll find yourself swiping through tens of cards you\u2019ve seen far too often, just waiting for the one card that you need to fulfil some objective.</p> <p>Eventually the game gets too clever for its own good: a subplot featuring a traitorous senator ends in frequent kidnappings where you end up running blindfolded, randomly swiping left or right until you either stumble to safety or fall into a lake and drown. A Monkey Island-style insult-swordfighting mechanic also shows up in around three occasions, except the rules are never really explained and there\u2019s no good reason for ever accepting a fight.</p> <p>Reigns offers a pretty, innovative and charming diversion, then, but don\u2019t let yourself care too deeply about what actually happens, or the charm will give way to frustration fast.</p> <p>Reigns is available for <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.devolver.reigns\">Android</a> (\u00a32.79), <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/reigns/id1114127463\">iOS</a> (\u00a32.29) and <a href=\"http://store.steampowered.com/app/474750/\">Steam</a> (\u00a31.99).</p> <ul> <li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/sep/02/hue-review-a-colourful-experiment-worth-experiencing\">Hue review \u2013 a colourful experiment worth experiencing</a><br></li> <li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/jul/12/pokemon-go-review-it-may-not-be-a-good-game-but-its-a-great-experience\">Pok\u00e9mon Go review: not a good game... but a great experience</a><br></li> <li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/jan/28/my-dream-to-become-pro-gamer-ended-in-utter-failure\">Why my dream of becoming a pro gamer ended in utter failure</a><br></li> </ul>",

India News Network reported that the total number of foreign tourists <a href=\"http://indianewsnetwork.in/over-8500-regular-british-tourists-to-goa-cancel-their-bookings-this-year/\">has fallen 20% compared over the last two years</a>, while The Times of India said <a href=\"http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/Foreign-tourist-arrivals-nosedive-still-further/articleshow/50617949.cms\">57,000 foreign tourists arrived between October and December 2015</a>, compared with the 85,000 in the same period the previous year. Over 20,000 Russians, the demographic Goa recently relied on, have cancelled trips. The collapsing rouble and problems in the eurozone are external factors that partly explain the disappearing foreign tourist, but Goa doesn\u2019t help itself. In an IndyaWire.com social media survey, <a href=\"http://indyawire.com/42-per-cent-former-russian-tourists-to-goa-do-not-want-to-come-back-again-says-indyawire-com-russia-survey/\">42% of Russians who had visited in the last four years said they wouldn\u2019t be coming back</a>: Goa was too expensive, too dirty, the taxi mafia too aggressive, women didn\u2019t feel safe, the police were unco-operative.</p> <p>Anecdotal evidence supports claims of increased harassment of women. A chef friend from Chandigarh, who worked late in a restaurant, had to switch from a scooter to a car because she was being stalked on her way home. An Italian woman here for 10 days stopped travelling alone after a man tried to force her off her bike at night. And a Californian friend who has lived in India for more than 30 years told me about a new bag snatching gang targeting single females travelling alone in the evenings. Little by little, the foreigners who have settled here, the ones who made the parties and the markets come alive, are going elsewhere.</p> <p>But hey \u2026 good riddance? We don\u2019t need you? Domestic tourism will pick up the shortfall \u2013 after all, it rose 35% between 2013 and 2014. Here\u2019s the rub, though: aside from dramatically altering a place that, in the words of one friend, \u201chas been geared toward foreigners for 40 years\u201d, the bulk of this incoming demographic doesn\u2019t bring much money to the local economy. They generally arrive by the jeep- or coach-load, stay in budget hotels or in their own vehicles, cook their own food if they can or eat all-inclusive, generate huge amounts of garbage and leave.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It\u2019s a rush toward low-quality, pack-em-in resorts, at great environmental cost.</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Revenues are falling.

Which is funny, as the Goa government has been talking about high-end tourism for years. It was always its plan: get rid of the hippies and bring in the high-rollers. That\u2019s what the then chief minister Manohar Parrikar told me when I interviewed him in 2004. Well, they got rid of the hippies. And the high-end tourists? Surprise! They\u2019re not coming.

  "<p>Before the last election I shared a train journey with Ed Miliband and some of his advisers on their way to a live television debate. The conversation turned to mugs. Labour had produced a range emblazoned with campaign pledges, and one offering \u201ccontrols on immigration\u201d had <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/mar/29/diane-abbott-labour-immigration-controls-mugs-shameful\" title=\"\">angered the left of the party</a>.</p> <p>Miliband was puzzled and frustrated. The promise to manage the nation\u2019s borders followed logically from the impossibility of fighting an election on a manifesto implying the opposite. Who would advocate uncontrolled immigration? Besides, it was hardly the centrepiece of the campaign. Why get so hung up on one pledge when there were four others that the left should be cheering \u2013 protecting the NHS, for example, and raising living standards? There were mugs for those too.</p> <p>But the problem wasn\u2019t the mug so much as the ease with which an empty political vessel is filled with scepticism. No one who resented Labour for lax border policy in the past was impressed by a slogan of control; and anyone who found that kind of rhetoric distasteful was appalled that Labour should be borrowing it. One side doubted that Miliband meant what he said; the other side hoped he didn\u2019t. He paid the maximum price in perceived inauthenticity, for no return in votes.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/05/the-guardian-view-on-eu-migration-after-brexit-may-must-tell-us-what-she-wants\">The Guardian view on EU migration after Brexit: May must tell us what she wants | Editorial</a> </p> </aside>  <p>With immigration, perhaps more than any other policy area, the credentials of the messenger matter as much as the message. There is more space for consensus than is apparent in a polarised debate. Public attitude surveys find little support for the open-door approach, but also limited interest in raising drawbridges. Most people recognise that migrants make a valuable contribution to British society and always have done, but they also fret about the pressure put on public services \u2013 and, in some sectors, wages \u2013 by new arrivals. Many also find rapid change in the cultural contours of their neighbourhoods disorienting. Those are not unreasonable concerns, and the surest way to provoke mistrust is to conflate them with racist attitudes.</p> <p>The point is made well and with reference to detailed polling in a <a href=\"http://www.britishfuture.org/articles/less-racist-anxious/\" title=\"\">report \u2013 published in 2014</a> but still fresh with insight \u2013 from British Future, a thinktank specialising in matters of migration and identity.

It was designed not to reduce numbers but to increase the population of Australia by importing labour and it succeeded in that aim, as the Brexit bunch knew all along.</p> <p>The \u201cpoints-based system\u201d was always a phoney offer. It was clever shorthand for \u201cnon-racist yet rigorous-sounding alternative to the status quo\u201d, chosen because it seemed meritocratic (points are earned) and culturally digestible (Australia is a friendly, Anglophone cousin country). It was no more viable as a device for containing public anxiety about immigration than Miliband\u2019s mug, albeit with more retail appeal.

He donates large amounts to Australian charities. Just as he rescued Dastyari over his legal bills, he was also there in 2013 to offer a job to the former Labor treasurer <a href=\"http://www.smh.com.au/nsw/controversial-former-treasurer-off-the-rollercoaster-20130509-2jato.html\">Eric Roozendaal when he decided to quit New South Wales politics</a>.

Icac commissioner David Ipp made no finding of corrupt conduct against Roozendaal.</p> <p>Roozendaal went to Yuhu after he decided to leave politics in 2013 with six years to run of his parliamentary term. This allowed Ernest Wong, a prodigious Labor fundraiser, networker and former deputy mayor of Burwood, to be parachuted into his seat in the NSW upper house. </p> <p>At the time, Dastyari, then the general secretary of NSW Labor, said it was a mistake not to have a voice representing the Chinese community in parliament, given the former Chinese member Henry Tsang had resigned in 2009.

Huang also gave $3.5m to the University of Western Sydney to establish the Australia-China Institute of Arts and Culture. </p> <p>Late last year, Fairfax reported that Andrew Stoner, the former deputy premier, leader of the NSW Nationals and state trade minister, had been hired by Yuhu to provide advice on the agribusiness sector. <a href=\"http://www.andrewstoner.net.au/\">Stoner has a consultancy</a>.

On that day $743,000 was given to eight Australian charities including the Children\u2019s Medical Research Institute at Sydney\u2019s Westmead hospital. </p> <p>Huang also looked west to spread his generosity. A week before the Dastyari story broke, Fairfax reported the West Australian Liberal branch had benefited through contacts with Julie Bishop from <a href=\"http://www.smh.com.au/federal-politics/political-news/foreign-minister-julie-bishops-links-to-chinese-political-donors-20160823-gqzauy.html\">$500,000 worth of donations in the past two years</a> from Chinese businessmen, including Huang.</p> <p>All of the above is on the public record. And none of it is to suggest Huang Xiangmo, Minshen Zhu or any other Chinese donor has done anything wrong or illegal. Everyone seeks workers with skills and contacts, in government and outside. The other point to make is Anglo businesses also have networks and links into government that are potentially beneficial. But, without full disclosure, we will <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/sep/06/sam-dastyaris-labor-party-liberal-party-donations\">never know whether benefit is real or imagined</a>.</p> <p>Either way, the whole affair has again sparked a debate which should make everyone with an interest in politics question whether any donation is given to buy influence.

After all, patients, especially in the public health system, don\u2019t always see the same doctor and it\u2019s important to cover or recap important details. </p> <p>I used to greet patients at the door, ensure they were comfortably seated with phone turned off, hearing aid tuned in and notebook ready. I\u2019d exchange a few pleasantries to humanise the interaction. But frankly, I am surprised it has taken me so long to appreciate that no oncology consultation goes far without first relaying the news of \u201cthe test\u201d. \u201cThe test\u201d is an umbrella term encompassing all manner of bloods and x-rays \u2013 haemoglobin, biochemistry, liver function, tumour markers, CT scans, PET scans and the rest. From the moment of their cancer diagnosis, patients are wedded to \u201cthe test\u201d.</p> <p>It\u2019s different for brand new patients who are resigned to repeating their story multiple times to multiple doctors but when long-term patients return for their regular check-up they have one thing on their mind. So I have learnt to get to the point fast.</p> <p>If the news is good, I tell the patient as soon as we\u2019re out of earshot: \u201cYour tests were fine, come and sit down.\u201d Grips loosen, shoulders relax and some days you can feel the hiss of dissipating tension. When the news is bad, I escort the patient to a chair, make eye contact, and say, \u201cI\u2019m afraid the scans found a problem \u2013 we\u2019ll have plenty of time to discuss this.\u201d</p> <p>Everyone does it differently but over time, I have decided this is kinder than, \u201cHow are you? Let\u2019s go over any symptoms before we get to your results.\u201d</p> <p>Every patient has a story about spending sleepless nights and nail-biting days, fearing the worst but praying for a reprieve. When someone cries with relief at a scan that I\u2019d always expected to be normal, I can\u2019t help reflecting on how automatically scribbled test slips have the power to govern people\u2019s lives.</p> <p>\u201cYour bone scan was normal again. There was no sign of cancer in your spine, only arthritis,\u201d I recently reassured an elderly man with prostate cancer. He suffered from chronic back pain but the moment he mentioned it to a new provider, he scored himself another test. This time, a chiropractor had encouraged him to ask his GP for a scan. </p> <p>Tests crowded his life \u2013 he rued that there wasn\u2019t an event in recent times that hadn\u2019t been disrupted by an appointment or a test, from his nephew\u2019s wedding to his sister\u2019s funeral. Knowing that I\u2019d played a part in his misery, I suggested, giving him a break from tests. \u201cThey don\u2019t really help nearly as much as talking to you and seeing how you are doing,\u201d I said. But his wife was quick to squash his glee, \u201cOh no, I\u2019d go mad not knowing! You must do a blood test at least.\u201d</p> <p>As cancer patients are living longer, they are seeing their oncologists more and many visits are accompanied by some sort of test. In the case of breast cancer, but also others such as prostate and colon cancer, blood tumour markers are used to track tumour activity, with changing markers often triggering costly scans. Patients regard painful and inconvenient tests as the cross to bear if they are to stay alive. After all, without tests how will their oncologist know what\u2019s going on inside their body? For oncologists, writing test slips is as routine as breathing.</p> <p>But the evidence suggests that cancer patients who are not receiving chemotherapy and are not enrolled in clinical trials do not need frequent testing. Depending on the disease, professional guidelines have long recommended against so-called \u201croutine\u201d testing in cancer surveillance but patients continue to receive them. Not all tests are ordered by oncologists \u2013 in a fragmented environment, patients see multiple providers. They order a test hoping it will reveal something that a good history won\u2019t but this is seldom the case.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Tumour marker measurements in a range of advanced cancers altered management in a mere 2% of patients.</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Pathology and radiology tests have grown by around 10% each year. <a href=\"http://grattan.edu.au/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/806-costly-care.pdf\">The Grattan Institute estimates the overall cost of wasteful healthcare spending</a> to be as much as a billion dollars.</p> <p>It might seem intuitive that early detection of disease progression through tests might be helpful in instituting or switching therapies, avoiding unnecessary toxicity and guiding therapeutic choices but there is no evidence that a particular test done at a particular interval alone determines a change in course. </p> <p>On the other hand, there is evidence that more tests cause more anxiety. Up to 65% of patients with advanced cancer are said to suffer some form of psychological distress. Undergoing frequent tests, not clearly understanding why and waiting weeks, even months, for results traps them in an unenviable situation. Patients who are preoccupied by test results have been shown to have a worse quality of life. </p> <p>A recent study of more than 2,000 American women with metastatic breast cancer published in the Journal of Clinical Oncology found that more than a third of their providers were \u201cextreme users\u201d of blood tests and scans. (Here, extreme use was defined as more than 12 tumour marker tests and more than four scans per year.) Patients who were cared for by these providers had a 60% higher cost of care, more hospital-based care and later use of palliative care. A previous study found that tumour marker measurements in a range of advanced cancers altered management in a mere 2% of patients.</p> <p>The overuse of pathology and radiology tests is by no means a problem specific to oncology but cancer patients are among the most heavily investigated, with the direct cost of cancer care in Australia reaching over $4.5bn.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/sep/05/hpv-infection-rates-plummet-after-vaccine-with-china-the-next-frontier\">HPV infection rates plummet after vaccine with China the next frontier</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Entrenched physician practice is hard to change through guidelines alone. In one study, over 90% of oncologists reported that repeat tests were ordered by someone simply copying the previous order. Without being constrained by rigid rules, doctors must be accountable for the tests they order. Making doctors aware, individually where possible, of the cost of tests, has been shown to influence practice, at least in the short-term. Awareness of the myriad costs of over-investigation must begin early in a doctor\u2019s career. Good clinical practice means asking with every test ordered, \u201cHow will the results change my management?\u201d</p> <p>Patient expectations play a role in the prescribing habits of doctors. Comparisons in cancer are rife. \u201cMy neighbour with the same cancer gets a test every time, why don\u2019t I?\u201d is a common question posed to oncologists. The answer is not to order the test, rather to educate the patient. Patient surveys show a willingness to understand and avoid the harmful effects of indiscriminate testing. A key motivation for enduring tests is a feeling of security but patients need to understand that a good doctor-patient relationship, where concerns are promptly heeded, is no match for a battery of tests.</p> <p>When I tell patients I\u2019d rather not order tests that don\u2019t provide meaningful results in their clinical context, they often ask what else they can do to look after themselves, as if submitting to tests were a proxy for self-care. I tell them that there is growing evidence that they should maintain a healthy weight, eat everything but in moderation, get some form of regular exercise, stop smoking and nurture good relationships. </p> <p>Frequent testing improves neither quality nor quantity of life but these other recommendations nod to the foremost tenet of medicine, first do no harm.</p>",

He was criticized by Arizona senator Jeff Flake, who called his speech \u201cconfusing\u201d and said it was unrealistic to remove the estimated 11 million people living in the US without documents. </p> <p>In the interview, McCain appeared to disagree with that assessment.</p> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s\u2019 not doable is rounding up 11 million people and putting them across the southern border,\u201d McCain said. \u201cThat\u2019s not doable and, of course, not to mention what it would do in many other aspects.

This arbitrary number was put in place the year after third-party candidate Jesse Ventura won the governorship of Minnesota.

The most memorable scenes are the most graphic ones \u2013 re-enactments of abuse, rape and forced prostitution \u2013 which overpower the sex work success stories, and leave the room reeling. Put together, we\u2019re presented with an industry that either needs to be completely reinvented, or abolished altogether.</p> <p>It\u2019s a huge problem to tackle in 90 minutes, but with simple staging, a dense but whip-smart script, and outstanding performances from Collins and Larkin \u2013 sensitive, generous and strong, managing to somehow inject moments of levity amid the horror \u2013 The Game manages to cover all corners without feeling laboured.</p> <p>The two women aren\u2019t the only ones on stage. Five volunteer men, a different group each performance, answered a callout weeks in advance \u201cto be part of something that redresses misogyny\u201d.</p> <p>These nervous men sit at the back of a stage behind a white bed, ready to stand in for the male clients, pimps, partners and rapists involved in the stories. Collins and Larkin feed the men lines and actions that none look comfortable performing: verbal abuse; sex with a minor; physical violence; gang rape.</p> <p>The roles these men re-enact have been determined by chance, and they have no idea what\u2019s going to happen. It adds another layer of tension to the production but, as we\u2019re shown time and time again, they are being looked after. </p> <p>The volunteer actors are counselled before and after each production, with a touring therapeutic supervisor on standby. They have been given a place to look at the back of the theatre if they need to avert their eyes. They have been taught lines to say if they get too uncomfortable (\u201cI am not enjoying this, but I\u2019ll pretend to enjoy it,\u201d reads one, an echo of a sex worker\u2019s inner world; \u201cThis is not happening to me, it is happening to someone else,\u201d reads another). And if it gets too much, they can simply leave the stage, or tag another man in. </p> <p>Each time they tag out \u2013 and on opening night, almost all do at some point \u2013 we are reminded that leaving these scenes is a privilege. It may be \u201conly an hour\u201d for the audience, the performers and the men, but women like de Faute and Moran \u2013 whose stories unfold in a mounting torrent of trauma \u2013 couldn\u2019t just leave when they wanted to. </p> <p>\u2022 <em>The Game was part of <a href=\"http://www.brisbanefestival.com.au/\">Brisbane festival 2016</a>, which continues until 24 September. </em><em>Guardian Australia was a guest of Brisbane festival</em></p>",

The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/02/world-cup-japan-uae-shock-loss-reaction\">conquerors of Japan in Saitama last Thursday</a> \u2013 and home to more talented players per head of population than any other Asian nation and third-placed at the 2015 Asian Cup \u2013 seemed to fit the bill. All that was needed to forge a beautiful friendship was a hard-fought match, a show of skill from the Whites\u2019 golden generation and no quarter asked or given. It did not quite happen \u2013 and the Socceroos had much to do with that.</p> <p>The hosts had done their bit before the game. Abu Dhabi can be a sleepy football venue but the city pulled out the stops. It opened the gates, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/04/free-tickets-offered-for-socceroos-world-cup-qualifier-against-uae\">giving fans free entry into the Mohammed Bin Zayed Stadium</a>. In they streamed to be told to scream at the warming-up visiting goalkeepers. Prior to kick-off, an impressive tifo spelled out \u201cThe Dream of a Nation\u201d. Three points really would give the team great confidence of returning to the World Cup for the first time since 1990.</p> <p>Australia were not about to oblige even if the early signs were good for the UAE. Mark Milligan seemed to lose his head after suffering an early nutmeg, giving the ball away and scything down Omar Abdulrahman. The bushy-haired playmaker was constantly looking for the ball behind a high defence and sleepy right-back Ryan McGowan offered some early opportunities with Mat Ryan having to come to his rescue. Trent Sainsbury and Matthew Spiranovic also chipped in with vital interceptions and blocks.</p> <p>Yet Australia are Asian champions for a reason. The early passing would not have pleased coach Ange Postecoglou, his white shirt drenched in sweat long before the drinks break that the players enjoyed on the half-hour, yet after 17 minutes Robbie Kruse had the best chance. The Bayer Leverkusen man forced a good save from Khalid Eisa just moments after the goalkeeper had tipped a Spiranovic header over the bar.</p> <p>That\u2019s the way World Cup qualifiers often go, especially in the sweltering Middle East. The coach wants fast and attacking football yet conditions say otherwise. The Socceroos did however improve as the first half progressed and ended fairly comfortable.</p> <p>Abdulrahman tried to do something about that but even talented strikers such as Ahmed Khalil and Ali Mabkhout \u2013 far from their best in this game \u2013 are not always on his wavelength. Still, Abdulrahman\u2019s passing game in the final third is as smooth as ever, even if he is rather more reticent when it comes to work at the other end of the pitch.</p> <p>Despite Abdulrahman\u2019s dislike for defending, UAE stayed compact in a 4-4-2 and didn\u2019t give their guests much space in the middle. The playmaker was active again early in the second half but Australia only looked more and more in control and almost took the lead when Aaron Mooy shook the bar with a shot from the edge of the area. Seconds later, Mabkhout was shooting over from just outside the six-yard box as UAE crafted their best chance.<br></p> <p>There was always a hint of danger from the hosts but never any sense of pressure being built by UAE. Australia, in contrast, increasingly looked like getting the goal that would provide a win that was becoming increasingly deserved. It was almost a clich\u00e9 to say that the game was set up for Tim Cahill to come off the bench and find half a yard and a goal. But it was and so he did with his first touch of the game, getting on the end of a delicious Brad Smith cross. The display was already impressive but combined with the result, it is one of Australia\u2019s best World Cup qualification performances since joining Asia.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/01/socceroos-off-to-winning-start-with-victory-over-iraq-in-world-cup-qualifier\">Socceroos off to winning start with victory over Iraq in World Cup qualifier</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The UAE then do share an Australian experience with Japan then \u2013 falling prey to a winning Cahill cameo from the bench with the mercury high and the punches to the corner flag low. On Tuesday night at least, the west Asians did not seem ready to knock the impressive Asian champions off their perch and be a major barrier to Australia\u2019s fourth successive World Cup appearance. For all their undoubted talent, Mahdi Ali\u2019s men just were not able to put the cool visitors under enough pressure on a sweltering evening.</p> <p>Perhaps Saudi Arabia can stop the Socceroos, especially as Al Hilal fans will never forget the Asian Champions League final loss at the hands of Western Sydney Wanderers in 2014. The Green Falcons came back from a goal down against Iraq to win 2-1 with two late penalties to move level top of the group with Australia. The Saudis have not been impressive so far but they have been a little lucky. The October game in Jeddah will be fascinating.</p> <p>But when it comes to Asian rivals, maybe the Socceroos will be stuck with Japan. The Samurai Blue recovered from their shock home defeat last week to win 2-0 in Thailand, a victory that was more comfortable than the scoreline suggests. Japan are in Australia in November and on this form the Socceroos will fancy their chances.</p>",

There was no degree course when Osborn McCutcheon felt drawn to architecture \u2013 one designed one\u2019s own. His family was not rich but comfortable, part of the tight circle of respectable Methodist Melbourne \u2013 he would later marry his first cousin. He worked in practices in San Francisco and London, and the immaculate line drawings of cathedrals and cottages, wells and windows, were the fruits of a year\u2019s wandering in Europe in 1925. For his first few years at the firm Bates &amp; Peebles, where he had earlier been articled, McCutcheon had a negative income, subsisting on borrowings.</p> <p>That may partly explain the eventual panache of ICI House, its pent-up fullness with ideas. What with Depression and War, there were more bad years than good in McCutcheon\u2019s first two decades\u2019 practice. He designed a number of celebrated Melbourne buildings, including the striped classical <a href=\"http://www.onmydoorstep.com.au/heritage-listing/736/former-amp-building\">AMP Society headquarters</a> (1932), the vivacious Jazz-Moderne <a href=\"https://urban.melbourne/forum/former-buckley-nunn%E2%80%99s-men%E2%80%99s-store\">Buckley &amp; Nunn men\u2019s store</a> (1933), and the Moderne\u2013classical <a href=\"http://www.onmydoorstep.com.au/heritage-listing/2382/second-church-of-christ-scientist\">Second Church of Christ, Scientist</a>, in Camberwell (1937). But much of his work was domestic \u2013 commissions for houses from Melbourne\u2019s well-to-do. More formative were probably two and a half hectic years spent with the American military.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The building swayed slightly. In the fish tank on the executive floor \u2026 the water lapped gently from side to side</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>When the US Army Corps of Engineers (Southwest Pacific Area) was established in February 1942, McCutcheon was recruited to head an architectural section which churned out hundreds of designs for military buildings \u2013 huts and warehouses, hangars and hospitals. Major McCutcheon, as he was, nearly came unstuck in New Guinea, bringing home malaria that turned him a vivid yellow, but also a strong faith in dry construction and prefabrication, which he would loudly defend to a sceptical profession (\u201cI have no time for the view that such an approach to architecture inevitably lowers our standards.\u201d).

But he signified his embrace of modernism mainly by living in it, completing an ingenious \u201cpassive solar house\u201d for his family in Mt Eliza, a rural enclave 30 miles from the city, at Christmas 1950.</p> <p>\u2018Kackeraboite\u2019, named after the local creek, was a long slim rectangle the width of a single room, north wall sheathed in glass, with huge sliding doors and banks of operable glass louvres split by a breezeway, sitting on an asphalted concrete slab that acted as a heat bank. Sun that penetrated to the back wall in winter did not hit the slab in summer, regulating internal temperatures. When McCutcheon\u2019s contemporaries Robin Boyd, Frederick Romberg and Roy Grounds hosted Walter Gropius in May 1954, Kackeraboite was the venue of the reception \u2013 the Bauhaus sage wandered fascinated in the surrounding bushland, looking for koalas.</p> <p>By that stage, McCutcheon had been drawn into one of Australia\u2019s most rancorous aesthetic controversies, architecture\u2019s counterpart of William Dobell\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.artgallery.nsw.gov.au/prizes/archibald/1943/15672/\">Mr Joshua Smith</a> winning the <a href=\"http://www.smh.com.au/good-weekend/the-william-dobell-portrait-that-broke-a-friendship-and-divided-a-nation-20141016-10r84z.html\">Archibald Prize</a>. In January 1952, <a href=\"http://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/18256075\">fire had gutted</a> the great Gothic Revival pile of Wilson Hall at Melbourne University. Opinion was starkly divided about how to replace it.</p> <p>The university council initially agreed to an exact rebuilding. But when it baulked at the expense, McCutcheon proposed a far cheaper modern alternative: a <a href=\"http://www.architecture.com.au/docs/default-source/vic-notable-buildings/wilson-hall-university-of-melbourne.pdf?sfvrsn=0\">concrete-encased, steel-framed rectangular box</a> with glass curtain walls and brick in-fill, and an interior of Swedish birch incorporating an intricate stained-glass screen designed by Douglas Annand and a chancellor\u2019s throne fashioned by Grant Featherston. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"48c318eab8ac1934da5e7c1b9dab74d53b8378d2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/48c318eab8ac1934da5e7c1b9dab74d53b8378d2/0_0_1753_2325/754.jpg\" alt=\"Architect\u2019s drawing ICI House.\" width=\"754\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">An architect\u2019s drawing for ICI House.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Illustration: Bates Smart McCutcheon</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The professoriat rebelled. But for a young colleague, Robert Dunster, it evinced McCutcheon\u2019s leadership and urbanity. \u201cWilson Hall was the first building in Melbourne for decades that wasn\u2019t simple or mundane, a house or a factory. And McCutcheon wanted perfection. He wanted a building to stand for a couple of hundred years. And he was able to inspire colleagues, the university and building workers with that idea.\u201d<br></p> <p>McCutcheon scorned flamboyance, but there was a flair to his purpose. The hour\u2019s morning commute from Kackeraboite to BSM\u2019s St Kilda Road studio was spent planning: by the time he arrived, trailing butter paper and cigarette smoke, he had laid out his daily objectives. Dunster recalls an afternoon standing at his boss\u2019s desk awaiting attention. At length, McCutcheon looked up and said: \u201cThree and a half minutes.\u201d Then he resumed his activities for exactly that time before engaging again.</p> <p>When not filling notebook after notebook with emphatic scrawlings, he would be rotating his pencil in his mouth. The tell-tale mark of pencil lead between his two front teeth was a firm in-joke. He abstained from alcohol \u2013 the sherry decanter on the sideboard at Kackeraboite was for the pleasure of visitors. But he was a peerless networker, especially over luncheon tables at Melbourne\u2019s elite Savage Club, connected among politicians and planners, councillors and builders alike. In the 1930s, for example, he had designed the Ivanhoe mansions of the brothers <a href=\"http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/watts-ernest-alfred-11983\">Ernie and Frank Watts</a>, who ran the city\u2019s biggest construction company. In some respects, their partnership in ICI House was foreordained.</p> <h2>Sweet and lowdown</h2> <p>That, but maybe not much else. A walk round Melbourne\u2019s central business district 60 years ago would have revealed a riot of bluestone, sandstone, brick and stucco, with the occasional flash of marble and granite \u2013 and, compared with today, very much more light. That was because Melbourne, like every Australian city bar Perth, and the vast majority of the world\u2019s bigger metropolises, <a href=\"https://www.scribd.com/document/199510132/The-Limited-City-Building-Height-Regulations-in-the-City-of-Melbourne-1890-1955-by-Peter-Mills-1997\">observed a height limit</a>.</p> <p>Melbourne\u2019s, set in 1916, was 132 feet; Sydney allowed 150 feet. These horizontal slashes across Australian skies irked local architects, who argued that their various rationales, about fire safety and urban congestion, were outdated. But by some standards, the allowances were quite generous: London had only just begun tinkering with its 100-foot limit, while Paris (despite the Eiffel Tower) had ruled itself off at 65 feet. Nor did ICI Australia and New Zealand (ICIANZ), the antipodean arm of Britain\u2019s sprawling Imperial Chemical Industries, seem a prime candidate to scour the sky.</p> <p>ICIANZ straggled over eight sites in Melbourne, including a termite-ridden archive in an old chemical plant in Yarraville presided over by an aged ex-serviceman with a wooden leg; it had only just retired a logo featuring Britannia staring wistfully out to sea. Its parent, meanwhile, was a waddling, paternalistic bureaucracy, whose own London headquarters was a neoclassical low-rise faced in Portland stone and festooned with sculptures: Millbank was known among chafing middle managers as \u2018Millstone\u2019. ICI\u2019s chairman, <a href=\"https://books.google.com.au/books?id=_LogT24DDJ0C&amp;pg=PA21&amp;lpg=PA21&amp;dq=lord+fleck+venerable+bede&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=DjY61r1ts_&amp;sig=eOr7LNrvJxVWXsjlJV6GHlBdCrY&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjKw8nfn-_OAhWGkZQKHVYMA8cQ6AEIMDAD#v=onepage&amp;q=lord%20fleck%20venerable%20bede&amp;f=false\">Sir Alexander Fleck</a>, was a childless widower whose passions were hill climbing, tree felling and the Venerable Bede.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"679a4e7e1c207d18cc0484bc3414d52bc103545f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/679a4e7e1c207d18cc0484bc3414d52bc103545f/0_83_1080_743/1000.jpg\" alt=\"ICI House pictured in 1958.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"688\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">ICI House pictured in 1958.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Wolfgang Sievers</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Something at ICIANZ, however, had recently shifted. A generational change in management had placed two younger men at the top: 50-year-old <a href=\"http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/begg-kenneth-gowan-9472\">Ken Begg</a> as chairman and 40-year-old <a href=\"http://oa.anu.edu.au/obituary/glenn-sir-joseph-robert-archibald-archie-14886\">Archibald Glenn</a> as managing director, who wished to signify their ambitions with a new headquarters. In March 1952, the company had acquired a 2,340-square metre site at one of Melbourne\u2019s highest points, Eastern Hill, where Lonsdale Street protrudes beyond the Hoddle Grid. Aligned with Parliament House and the Treasury Building, it seemed to cry out for a bold, proud building. And McCutcheon was eager to provide it.</p> <p>McCutcheon\u2019s first innovation was a cunning way to meet the spirit of the height limit while defying its letter, proposing a rectangular \u2018tower-type building\u2019 of 203 feet that would occupy only 41% of the block at ground level; the rest of the block would be allotted to a courtyard garden featuring public artwork of the kind with which he had enriched Wilson Hall. McCutcheon soothed the anxieties of the State Building Regulations Committee by persuading them that approval for ICI House need not prelude rampant development: section 214 of the Uniform Planning Regulations entitled the committee to modify rules without amending them. But nobody missed the implications when The Herald<em> </em>foreshadowed the plans in May 1955: \u2018New Skyline for City?\u2019 read the headline.</p> <p>The Metropolitan Fire Brigade was anxious. Not only was the height limit calibrated by the reach of their ladders and water jets, but the 360-degree view of Melbourne they enjoyed from their watchtower, only 200 yards from the site of ICI House, would be disrupted. To placate them, McCutcheon incorporated into his building elaborate fire protection measures, including a pioneering sprinkler system above the fifth floor. Others were also discomfited. The Eastern Hill block was not only home to the Salvation Army, but also several brothels.

In the lineage from the Tower of Babel to the Eiffel Tower, here was a skyscraper worth the name: \u201cThis is a clean, precipitous tower in the best tradition. Elbow room is the first essential for effective skyscraping, and the ICI has that.\u201d ICI had actually obtained even more elbow room than bargained for: having applied for permission to erect to 203 feet, it was approved to build to 230 feet thanks to the transposition of the \u20183\u2019 and the \u20180\u2019 by a Melbourne City Council typist.</p> <p>Yet height was only the most obvious feature of McCutcheon\u2019s design. Externally and internally, it was absolutely <em>au courant.</em> Without, McCutcheon clad ICI House in gleaming glass curtain walls to north and south that would flood the interior with natural light \u2013 a homage to New York\u2019s UN Building and Lever House. Within, he offered vistas of uninterrupted space, a pioneering open plan, by quarantining the building\u2019s services, such as lifts, plumbing and air conditioning, in a discrete 275-foot service tower, initially behind the core tower, then at right angles \u2013 a solution adopted in Chicago\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.embarch.com/chicago-inland-steel-building/\">Inland Steel headquarters</a> (1957) and San Francisco\u2019s <a href=\"http://untappedcities.com/2011/12/09/architecture-spotlight-one-bush-plaza-a-place-of-international-style/\">Crown Zellerbach Building</a> (1959), classic glass curtain wall skyscrapers whose construction was concurrent with ICI House.</p> <p>Perhaps the cleverest feature, meanwhile, was something the public never saw. Drawing on his experiences with the US Army, McCutcheon made extensive use of prefabrication and dry construction: floor units, beam encasements, concrete spandrels, panels of the west and east walls and the synthetic granite panels enclosing the service tower were all fabricated off site.</p> <p>This, then, was a bold experiment. To be on the safe side, McCutcheon trialled several features, including the curtain wall detailing, service tower and reliance on prefabrication, in another smaller building in William Street, a headquarters for brickmaker Humes, whose construction was proceeding just in advance of ICI House. But it would be an underestimate to see Australia\u2019s first skyscraper as a triumph of technology. It was a testament to McCutcheon\u2019s personality, his calm authority, that Begg and Glenn bought into his vision so comprehensively. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t ICI telling McCutcheon it wanted a glass box for its headquarters,\u201d observes heritage architect <a href=\"http://www.lovellchen.com.au/ICIhouse.aspx\">Peter Lovell</a>. \u201cIt was the other way around.\u201d</p> <p>The activity, moreover, formed part of a general building boom, unmatched in Australia since the 1880s. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t simply about modernism,\u201d says Philip Goad, deputy dean of architecture at Melbourne University and author of the history <a href=\"https://www.batessmart.com/bates-smart/studio/recognition/publications/150-years-of-australian-architecture/\">Bates Smart</a> (2004). \u201cIt was about modernisation, a sense that the country now had to get its act together.\u201d After two fallow decades, more than a score of tall office buildings would be completed in Melbourne between 1955 and 1960. It excited rivalry too. The final unveiling of plans in April 1956 was front page news in the Sydney Morning Herald, beneath the shocked headline: \u201cMelbourne to have tallest building.\u201d In due course height limits would stand no chance against the urges of oneupmanship.</p> <p>BSM benefited: the firm was commissioned to design a second ICI House (1957), at 10 storeys, on Circular Quay, and handsome headquarters for Mutual Life and Citizens Assurance (1957-1960) in Sydney, Adelaide, Perth, Brisbane and Hobart. But Melbourne was the place to be. As EA Watts Pty Ltd began to manoeuvre the steel skeleton into place in May 1957, ICI had to erect a viewing platform for the benefit of \u201cpavement superintendents\u201d \u2013 the crowds, sometimes running into hundreds, who gathered round the site each day, including one man who would come every single morning, without exception, for nearly two years.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"bcb18b5463172c44ca3bf843fa2742585445d0ef\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bcb18b5463172c44ca3bf843fa2742585445d0ef/0_0_2745_2004/1000.jpg\" alt=\"ICI House interior in full colour.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"730\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018It wasn\u2019t simply about modernism\u2019: an ICI House interior.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bates Smart McCutcheon</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Watts\u2019 workforce was itself a cross-section of the new postwar Australia: Australians and Englishmen alongside Italians, Greeks, Dutchmen, Americans, Yugoslavs, Poles and Egyptians, building their futures by making up to <strong>\u00a3</strong>50 a week. They worked speedily and harmoniously, completing the framing by Christmas, and the flooring systems within six further months. They paid a price too: three workers died, two in falls from height. Struan Gilfillan, then the most junior architect on the BSM team assisting McCutcheon, and today the last survivor, recalls the headlong rush: \u201cTowards the end I was doing much of my work on the site. You\u2019d design something one day, it would be built the next day, and you\u2019d be inspecting it the day after.\u201d</p> <p>Though ICIANZ\u2019s Begg and Glenn were interested clients, BSM exerted a control over the project that by modern lights seems quite extraordinary, even designing the custom-made furniture, manufactured by Collingwood\u2019s Hunt Son &amp; Oliver, with contributions from Grant Featherston. For browsing architectural eyes, there was much to see. The pilotis harked back to the <a href=\"http://www.villa-savoye.fr/en/\">Villa Savoye</a> (1928) in Pouissy \u2013 the prototype modernist dwelling, designed by Le Corbusier. The landscaped courtyard garden, with its <a href=\"http://www.paulhagon.com/playground/nla/geo/pi/nla.pic-an25110332\">fountain sculpture</a> by Gerald Lewers, was patterned by John Stevens on a similar feature of the <a href=\"http://modern-brazil-architecture.blogspot.com.au/2009/12/ministry-of-education-and-health.html\">Ministry of Education and Health</a> (1936) in Rio \u2013 the original International Style office building, designed by Lucio Costa and Oscar Niemeyer under Le Corbusier\u2019s sway.</p> <p>The entranceway steps, which subtly slow the visitor\u2019s transition from outside to inside, are a Japanese motif. The interior reliance on wood \u2013 warm and easy on the eye \u2013 shows Scandinavian influences. All of it encased in a characteristically American building typology for a British multinational client \u2026 and in an Australian city.</p> <h2>An Australian landmark</h2> <p>Height\u2019s allure could be dark also. Fifty-eight-year-old PMG technician Ben Edwards had not been himself for some days. Since starting a course of blood pressure tablets, he had been forgetting things, feeling panicked. Could he be going out of his mind, he asked his GP. And though assured otherwise, he hesitated to go to work in Flinders Lane on 6 November 1958, before deciding he must. </p> <p>At 1.45pm, having drawn his pay, he asked leave from his superior to sort out some money orders. Two hours later, he became the site\u2019s fourth death, plummeting to the pavement of Albert Street from the roof of the nearly complete ICI House, passing by two window cleaners, who took him for a large bag. The next week his wife received two money orders, although no note, and the coroner returned an open verdict. (The 25-year-old investigating constable who deemed there \u201cno suspicious circumstances\u201d also played back pocket for St Kilda. Allan Jeans went on to be a sainted name in Australian rules \u2013 in Melbourne, you are never far from football).</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"7b44b1a009c11150bf3f36cbcefa7319033101eb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7b44b1a009c11150bf3f36cbcefa7319033101eb/118_62_983_1228/800.jpg\" alt=\"Sir Osborn McCutcheon\u2019s speech notes, written on the back of an old memo.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sir Osborn McCutcheon\u2019s speech notes, written on the back of an old memo.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bates Smart McCutcheon</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>When ICI House was opened a fortnight from Christmas, the fascination it exerted was more obviously wholesome. In his speech to assembled dignatories, British chairman Fleck spoke of \u201can Australian landmark\u201d, \u201ca Commonwealth occasion\u201d, and of the duty borne by companies \u201cto see that the buildings they commission shall be not only appropriate to their needs and efficient, but also aesthetically satisfying\u201d. McCutcheon\u2019s speech notes, dashed off at typical speed on the back of a memo, capitalised the word DIGNITY next to a lower case efficiency. And it is fair to say that of the 20,000 citizens who took the opportunity to tour ICI House during the ensuing Open Week, very few were enticed by its efficiency. On the contrary, the building seemed the last word in worker comfort, from its 100-seat ground floor theatre and Wales banking chamber, to its top floor 400-seat cafeteria with uninterrupted views for 70 miles in each direction and gleaming Gaggia coffee machine.</p> <p>By day the air conditioning system and sealed windows, maintaining a constant 20C and 50% humidity, were a revelatory relief from summer swelter \u2013 not to mention the pampering indulgences like the roof garden, sub-basement recreation rooms and 12th-floor staff lending library. By night, with 5,500 electric lights, ICI House blazed like a Chinese lantern. \u201cProbably no other building project since \u2026 the Exhibition Buildings in 1879 has captured Melbourne\u2019s imagination as much as this glass-house giant,\u201d reported The Herald, whose cartoonist \u2018Weg\u2019 (William Ellis Green) depicted ICI House as a vitreous mountain while a suited businessman ran towards three mischievous cricket-playing boys. \u201cPlease! Kids!\u201d he was exclaiming. \u201cDon\u2019t play here!\u201d</p> <p>Such critics as had existed were disarmed. The ageing artist Norman Lindsay had denounced the glass box as \u201ca final triumph to modernistic art, with its cry of death to all beauty\u201d. As if to head the charge off, ICIANZ began amassing what became <a href=\"http://trove.nla.gov.au/work/34939812?q=ici+australia+art&amp;c=book\">Australia\u2019s most extensive corporate art collection</a>, including works by Arthur Boyd, Arthur Streeton, John Brack, Sidney Nolan and \u2026 Norman Lindsay. The collection complemented a building that was itself a kind of art object.</p> <p>A 20-minute ICI movie, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUG0HLOwwBI\">Skyscraper Story</a>, painted its headquarters in heroic hues. Soaring towards the clouds reflected in its glass, ICI House was the perfect subject for the cool, functionalist, objective photography of Wolfgang Sievers. Arising <a href=\"http://nla.gov.au/nla.obj-140508210/view\">like a mirage</a> beyond the foliage of Parliament Gardens or <a href=\"http://nla.gov.au/nla.obj-140510360/view\">contrasted with the antique</a> Lonsdale Street, ICI House appealed to the alert and discriminating urban eye of Mark Strizic.</p> <p>Particularly reveling in the attention was the company\u2019s public relations manager, Peter Ryan \u2013 later, at Melbourne University Press, one of Australia\u2019s most distinguished publishers. For him, the building was an \u201cunimaginable boon\u201d, redefining what had been a rather dour and inscrutable enterprise: \u201cFor a time, editors and journalists from all over Australia would do almost anything to be invited on a personal tour of inspection, accompanied by lunch in the splendid private dining room.\u201d Through Ryan, Geoffrey Blainey was employed to write a company history of ICIANZ, on which he worked in ICI House for a year. \u201cIt was very handsome from the outside,\u201d he recalls. \u201cIn the low skyline of that era it stood out like a glass trophy.\u201d Like many a worker since he was less enamoured of the open plan, which affirmed a personal preference: \u201cI like rooms with walls.\u201d</p> <h2>Breaking glass</h2> <p>Another significant and sincere admirer also withheld a little of his approbation. Robin Boyd was then embarked on his seminal modernist critique of The Great Australian Ugliness (1960), with its denunciation of the local taste for busy and obtrusive \u201cfeaturism\u201d. He welcomed ICI House, relieved that \u201ceven in a frantically featurist society a non-featurist building can be a success\u201d. Here was \u201cas good a representative of the crystallised mid-century style as can be found anywhere in the world\u201d, particularly ingenious in its \u201cclever separation of service and office areas\u201d, which were \u201cnicely complementary to each other in strength and proportion, like male and female.\u201d At the same time, part of him shrank from its implications: in future corporate design suites, he speculated in The Puzzle of Architecture (1962), there might be \u201cno seat \u2026 for the architect, let alone a throne.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBoyd saw that office building could become a formularised system,\u201d says Melbourne University\u2019s Goad. \u201cWith the standardisation of work spaces, the exterior mattered little in the long run, and architectural aesthetics were unnecessary, which worried him greatly \u2013 because at the other end of the spectrum were the Eero Saarinens and J\u00f8rn Utzons, one-off gymnastic performers. In an architecture of extremes, how do you teach beauty? How do you judge whether the Opera House is spectacular, or just an ugly spiky thing? So although he admired ICI House, it also caused him grief.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c33674cf8566b1fd9409dae2b2fcdf3811804f67\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c33674cf8566b1fd9409dae2b2fcdf3811804f67/0_0_3225_2183/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Melbourne skyline including the old Gas &amp; Fuelbuildings.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"677\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Melbourne skyline including the old Gas &amp; Fuel<br>buildings.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: The Age/Fairfax Media via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>By then, too, grief had come McCutcheon\u2019s way, and more directly. At first, the only problems with ICI House were minor, even amusing. It was found, for example, that the building swayed ever so slightly \u2013 at the top, about \u00be of an inch in a 80mph gale. The only place this was perceptible was in the fish tank on the executive floor, where the water lapped gently from side to side \u2013 BSM\u2019s solution was a thick black line round the top of the tank.</p> <p>Then, just before Christmas 1960, one of the glass panes shattered into tiny fragments. It was such a shock that, at first, a sniper was suspected. But then another shattered, and another. \u201cEveryone hoped that it wasn\u2019t anything major,\u201d recalls Struan Gilfillan. \u201cYou always accept a few breakages. But pretty soon they seemed to start falling like confetti.\u201d Altogether, 71 panes of the Pan-O-Glass from Belgium\u2019s Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Belge d\u2019Exploitations Verri\u00e8res would shatter, and it would be more than a year before any explanation emerged. In the hiatus, timber canopies had to be erected over nearby footpaths.</p> <p>BSM smarted. \u201cOh, we were shocked and horrified,\u201d remembers Gilfillan. \u201cThe criticism from architects at other firms was endless. \u2018Oh, you\u2019re from Bates Smart? You did <em>that</em> building, did you? Well, fancy that.\u2019 We were very relieved when the scientific analysis was done.\u201d Research by ER Ballantyne of the CSIRO\u2019s Building Research Division sheeted the blame to the manufacturer, explaining how the Pan-O-Glass was fatally weakened by nickel sulphide impurities, particles smaller than the head of the pin, as they expanded and contracted in Australian temperatures. That Ballantyne\u2019s paper, <a href=\"http://trove.nla.gov.au/work/21036804?q&amp;versionId=25028407\">Fracture of Toughened Glass Wall Cladding</a>, ICI House, Melbourne (1961), was another world first was little consolation. ICIANZ\u2019s announcement that it was replacing all the panes on the west wall at a cost in excess of \u00a350,000 made for an unwelcome front-page headline in the Herald in March 1962.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Not only can you see out both sides of Orica House, but the views are \u2026 well, they\u2019re to die for</p> <footer> <cite>Philip Goad</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Glass curtain walls would prove problematic in other ways too. ICI House was an expensive building to operate, air conditioning absorbing nearly 40% of the building\u2019s running costs. Others experienced difficulties still more pronounced. In January 1962 the AMP Society clawed back for Sydney the mantle of the location of Australia\u2019s tallest building, opening a 25-storey tower at Sydney Cove, but when the sun got the better of its unsheltered northern curtain wall it became virtually uninhabitable. When its architects, Peddle Thorp, were sought to design a headquarters for Custom Credit on St Kilda Road, the commission specifically referred to \u201ca dignified building \u2026 not a flimsy glass box \u2026 something to reflect the stability of the credit system\u201d. The glass curtain wall lost Australian favour, and was scorned for decades afterwards.</p> <p>In the end, ICI House\u2019s chief legacy became its size, on lists of which it steadily slipped down. Developers, whose ambitions increasingly defined city skylines, used their emancipation from height limits not for aesthetic enrichment but steeper rents; much as Boyd had prophesied, the architect\u2019s role was diminished. Corporate image-making was likewise refined, visible in the contrast between ICI House and <a href=\"http://vhd.heritagecouncil.vic.gov.au/places/4690\">BHP House</a> (1972), the definitive headquarters of the next generation. The former looked as stylish as James Bond\u2019s cigarette lighter; the latter, designed by the mighty American corporate practice Skidmore Owings &amp; Merrill, as darkly cool as a presidential limousine.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"04ffe25b8c1b0f4a8da22fa231be3f0f39de28f8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/04ffe25b8c1b0f4a8da22fa231be3f0f39de28f8/0_49_1331_964/1000.jpg\" alt=\"An office inside ICI House in 1958.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"724\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">An office inside ICI House in 1958.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Wolfgang Sievers</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>And as it transformed city streets into dark and windy canyons, sucked energy, crammed people and flattened textures, the tall office building began courting a critical eye. \u201cSo here we are,\u201d sighed the Sydney Morning Herald\u2019s arch sceptic <a href=\"http://oa.anu.edu.au/obituary/molnar-george-14136\">George Molnar</a>. \u201cOur boxes are not economical. They are functional in a restricted sense only. They fail in the aesthetics they profess. What made us build them? It is an old story. Unnecessary centralisation in the city through real-estate speculation. They are jungle creatures, rising to the sky for light \u2026 It is not just a question of style. We should aim for a saner conception of our cities.\u201d And one who would have nodded approval was Osborn McCutcheon. <br></p> <h2><strong>A fall from fashion</strong></h2> <p>If he never regretted ICI House, McCutcheon grew to share Boyd\u2019s ambivalence about its unintended legacy. Knighted in 1966 and increasingly required to act as a grand old man of architecture, he enjoined audiences to design more humanely. \u201cWe act for communities; for private and public bodies; and not as creators of monuments to directors or to ourselves,\u201d he warned. \u201cThe test of a building is the human responses it evokes, not its size or glamour.\u201d</p> <p>McCutcheon was strongly influenced by The Club of Rome\u2019s sobering world prospectus The Predicament of Mankind<em> </em>(1968), Paul Ehrlich\u2019s Malthusian prophecies in The Population Bomb (1968), and Ian McHarg\u2019s hopes of ecological redemption in Design with Nature (1969). Some of his writings assumed almost a mystical air: \u201cThe simple man, the quiet man, is moved and has deep satisfaction from earthy smells, the sky, wind, tree; by the storm and night murmurings, by the friendship and companionship of birds and animal life, and the power to plant and tend growing things and to human relationships.\u201d</p> <p>Seventy-year-old McCutcheon then founded, as a joint venture between BSM and engineering firm Rankine &amp; Hill, a unique multi-disciplinary planning consultancy to provide more holistic solutions to what were commonly typed building problems. Urban Design and Planning Associates was led by his son Andrew, who had qualified as an architect, sheered away to become a Methodist minister, then studied social planning in the UK on a Churchill Scholarship. UDPA rose and fell, at one with the planning propensities of Whitlamism, at odds with the intellectual apathy of the Fraser years \u2013 although by standing between rapacious developers and recalcitrant protesters in the 1970s, it did much to save what remains today of Sydney\u2019s Rocks. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2016/apr/07/story-cities-17-canberra-capital-australia-walter-griffin-ideal-city\">Story of cities #17: Canberra's vision of the ideal city gets mired in 'mediocrity'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>By the 1980s, ICI House itself looked in peril. Grandiose head offices fell from fashion \u2013 some argued that they were no longer necessary, tied up capital and induced bureaucratic torpor. Some of ICI House\u2019s luxuries, like the lofty cafeteria and roof garden, were sacrificed to economy. When ICIANZ was <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/1997/05/09/business/ici-australia-shares-drop-sharply.html\">granted independence</a> by its restructuring parent company in July 1997, the <a href=\"http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2003/07/14/1058034935481.html\">great art collection was dispersed</a>, and the building itself sold to Macquarie Bank. ICIANZ\u2019s descendant, Orica, now occupies only five levels; the building\u2019s top floor is rented by British engineering consultancy Arup.</p> <p>Fifteen years ago, however, a new tenant looped Orica House back to its origins: BSM, architectural credits now including the likes of Melbourne\u2019s Crown Casino and Federation Square and Sydney\u2019s Mid City and Police Headquarters, moved into the sixth floor of its most significant building. Observing the new fashion for post-industrial bareness, but also as if to admire its original handiwork, it stripped the suspended ceiling system to reveal the prefabricated concrete flooring so revolutionary in its time. And while the face of the city has changed, the tall building of today being the soaring apartment tower, the thrill of gazing on it from elevation abides. \u201cMany big buildings these days are very fat for economic reasons, which is why you end up with big windowless areas,\u201d says Melbourne University\u2019s Goad. \u201cSo while there are some inefficiencies in the slab plan, the amenity advantages are huge \u2013 potential for cross ventilation, visual connection etc. Not only can you see out both sides of Orica House, but the views are \u2026 well, they\u2019re to die for.\u201d</p> <p>Multiple overlapping heritage protections, and nomination as one of eight buildings on the World Register of Significant Twentieth Century Australian Architecture, have further secured that outlook. Sensing that a touch of Mad Men chic might enhance its rental appeal, current owner Charter Hall has recently begun refurbishing its eight lifts, inspired by the original BSM design fished from a microfiche in the firm\u2019s archives, with Aalto-esque curved timber ceilings that roll gently into the rear wall.</p> <p>What once seemed to dwarf human scale today seems tactfully restrained \u2013 refraining from gobbling its whole block, making good on the ground its imposition on the sky. And what once was a vision of Melbourne\u2019s future now offers a powerful sense of communion with the architectural and social past.</p> <p><em>Follow Guardian Cities on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/guardiancities\">Twitter</a> and <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/guardiancities\">Facebook</a> to join the discussion</em></p>"
