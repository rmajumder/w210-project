  "<p>Theresa May is under massive cross-party pressure to grant MPs a vote on any decision to leave or limit UK involvement in the European single market, amid growing outrage at the prospect that parliament could be bypassed over the biggest economic decision in decades.</p> <p>Tory MPs joined forces with former leaders of Labour and the Liberal Democrats, the SNP and Greens to insist that parliament have a say and a vote, pointing out that, while the British people had backed leaving the EU, they had not chosen to leave the biggest trading market in the western world.</p> <p>Former Labour leader Ed Miliband held discussions with pro-EU Tory MPs on Saturday, and was said to be considering tabling an urgent question in the Commons, demanding that May appear before parliament to explain its future role in Brexit decisions, when MPs return on Monday.</p> <p>The SNP and pro-EU Tory MPs Nicky Morgan and Anna Soubry were also considering tabling questions, while former Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg, now the party\u2019s Brexit spokesman, said it would be appalling if detailed terms of Brexit, including the UK\u2019s future relations with the single market, were not voted on by MPs.</p> <p>Miliband told the <em>Observer</em>: \u201cHaving claimed that the referendum was about returning sovereignty to Britain, it would be a complete outrage if May were to determine the terms of Brexit without a mandate from parliament.</p> <p>\u201cThere is no mandate for hard Brexit, and I don\u2019t believe there is a majority in parliament for [it] either. Given the importance of these decisions for the UK economy \u2026 it has to be a matter for MPs.\u201d</p> <p>Clegg said: \u201cMy great worry is that while there will be a vote on repealing the 1972 European Communities Act, which is about the decision to leave the EU, it will be left to the executive alone to decide the terms of Brexit. That would not be remotely acceptable.\u201d</p> <p>The extraordinary cross-party alliance has formed since ministers made a succession of speeches at the Tory party conference in Birmingham last week, which left the clear impression they would <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/02/brexit-theresa-may-prioritises-immigration-curbs-over-free-movement\" title=\"\">press ahead with a hard Brexit</a>. The suggestion was that this would mean leaving the single market if that was the cost of regaining control of the UK\u2019s borders.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"578f5732ec71c22d1e56b4a0ecf4e0502f5523d7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/578f5732ec71c22d1e56b4a0ecf4e0502f5523d7/0_27_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Exterior shot of Houses of Parliament\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Extraordinary cross-party alliance has formed since Tory party conference in Birmingham.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Stefan Rousseau/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Concern has also grown after business leaders, led by the Confederation of British Industry and EEF (formerly the Engineering Employers Federation), wrote an open letter to the prime minister, warning that a hard Brexit that failed to secure a close relationship with the single market should be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/07/business-leaders-urge-theresa-may-to-avoid-hard-brexit\" title=\"\">ruled out \u201cunder any circumstances\u201d</a>.</p> <p>The letter says the terms on which the UK leaves the EU will be critical to the UK economy, jobs and future investment, while resorting to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/29/liam-fox-looks-to-wto-in-hint-at-hard-brexit-stance\" title=\"\">World Trade Organisation (WTO) rules</a> would leave 90% of UK trading in goods subject to new tariffs. This would mean an additional 20% in extra costs for the UK\u2019s food and drink industry and 10% for car producers.</p> <p>\u201cWe respect the result of the referendum, but the government must make sure that the terms of the deal to leave ensure stability, prosperity and improved living standards,\u201d the business groups say.</p> <p>MPs demanding a vote point out that the 2015 Tory manifesto made explicit that, while there would be an in/out referendum, membership of the single market would still be in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/10/uk-membership-european-single-market-worth-4-more-gdp-eu-referendum-economy\" title=\"\">country\u2019s best economic interests</a>. The manifesto said \u201cWe say: \u2018Yes to the single market\u2019\u201d, and that the party would safeguard the country\u2019s interests within it.</p> <p>May has only said there will be a vote on a repeal bill to remove the 1972 act from the statute book, and that parliament will be kept informed when possible on negotiations on the detailed terms. But there is no prospect of a vote on what form Brexit will take, nor the terms.</p> <p>Ministers, including chancellor Philip Hammond, have been at pains to stress that the government will seek the best possible \u201caccess\u201d to the single market.</p> <p>Labour\u2019s former shadow business secretary, Chuka Umunna, said: \u201cWe conclude from the Tory conference that they are waving the white flag on remaining in the single market before negotiations have even begun. If there is any move away from it, there should be consultation in parliament and a vote.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/09/norway-may-block-uk-return-to-european-free-trade-association\" title=\"\">Norway is a member of the single market</a> but not a member of the EU and has to pay into its budget and accept free movement rules.</p> <p>Green party co-leader Caroline Lucas said: \u201cThe assumption that those who voted to leave were also signalling their wish to withdraw from the single market is unfounded. And for a government whose own manifesto commits it to continued membership of the single market, to now seek to overturn that and reinterpret the referendum result, while denying people a say through a vote in parliament, is a constitutional outrage.</p> <p>\u201cOf course, the referendum result must be honoured \u2013 but the vote was to leave the EU, not to inflict the greatest possible damage to our economy and tear apart community cohesion. \u201d</p> <p>David Cameron\u2019s former policy guru condemned May and her government for the direction she is taking the country in over Brexit. Steve Hilton, who broke with the former PM to back Brexit, was scathing about home secretary Amber Rudd\u2019s suggestion to make firms list the number of foreign workers they employ. Ministers might as well announce that \u201cforeign workers will be tattooed with numbers on their forearms\u201d, he wrote in the <em>Sunday Times</em>.</p> <p>At the Tory conference, May said a Great Repeal bill would be put forward in the Queen\u2019s speech next spring and would be voted on in the next session of parliament, coming into force on the day of exit. Ministers insist they cannot give a \u201crunning commentary\u201d on the details of negotiations.</p> <p>A No 10 source said: \u201cAs the prime minister said in her conference speech, we\u2019re getting on with the job of delivering Brexit, and we\u2019re going to make a success of it. Building relationships is absolutely essential in this business and putting in the hard yards in this way means Theresa will be one of the best travelled PMs by the time she meets everyone at her first European council meeting next month.\u201d</p> <p>A source at the Department for Exiting the European Union said: \u201cParliament voted by six to one to give people the final say on EU membership in the referendum held on 23 June. While there can therefore be no attempt to keep Britain in the EU by the back door, we have been clear that parliament will be consulted and engaged throughout the process of exit.</p> <p>\u201cWe will introduce a Great Repeal bill to end the authority of EU law and we have been clear that we will follow all the constitutional and legal precedents that apply to any treaty on a new relationship with the EU.\u201d</p>",

  "<p>Pesky scientists! They\u2019re always causing trouble. Last Tuesday, they were in the newspapers with a report that \u201cbrain-training games\u201d do not make the brain better at anything except playing the games themselves. There\u2019s no evidence of real-world benefits, sharpened memory or improved cognitive function.</p> <p>Is this news? In my experience, scientists never say anything else. I can remember several previous reports that scientists have found brain-training games to be useless.</p> <p>Seven years ago, they were already telling us that such games were of \u201cno practical use to the elderly\u201d; I remember that story because it was illustrated by a photograph of Nicole Kidman. I thought at the time: she must be wondering who to sue to first, the newspaper or her dermatologist.</p> <p>(Kidman had been selected, of course, because <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2007/jun/25/advertising1\" title=\"\">she advertised \u201cbrain-training machines\u201d</a> on TV.)</p> <p>Non-Kidman adverts that got into worse trouble were those for Lumosity, a game that (according to the American Federal Trade Commission\u2019s Bureau of Consumer Protection) \u201cpreyed on consumers\u2019 fears about age-related cognitive decline\u201d by suggesting it could help combat this. According to those busybody scientists, it cannot. In January, makers Lumos Labs were <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/jan/06/lumosity-fined-false-claims-brain-training-online-games-mental-health\" title=\"\">ordered to pay $2m in redress</a>.</p> <p>So, you know. We hear a lot about these games being useless. Researching a little deeper behind the eye-catching headlines of last week, I find that yes: this latest report is actually a <em>study into previous studies</em>. The findings were not just that brain-training games are useless, but that scientists who have already said brain-training games are useless were right! They<em> are</em> useless!</p> <p>I imagine the latest batch of scientists making this announcement with their thumbs on their noses, waggling their fingers at the rest of us: morons, non-scientists, who sit lamely playing our \u201cbrain-training\u201d games in the hope of greater intellectual rigour. Useless! Useless! Can you hear me at the back? You dunce!</p> <p>This week, perhaps we can enjoy another report saying that last week\u2019s study into studies was itself correct. And then maybe they\u2019d like to have a big party, all these bloody scientists, clinking glasses as they make announcement after announcement about how pointless it is for the masses to try to sharpen up our old, soggy, ailing, failing brains. We might just as well sit playing with an old car tyre on a rope.</p> <p>There is a group of affected people here that nobody is thinking about. Not those who are especially worried by cognitive decline (or not that alone), but those who can\u2019t enjoy themselves unless they feel they\u2019re doing something useful.</p> <p>Does that ring a bell? You either are such a person or you\u2019re not. If not, chances are you know someone who is and you find them slightly stressful. It could be your wife. Or your father. (Or, if you\u2019re my husband, both.)</p> <p>I am terrible at doing nothing. I\u2019m not brilliant at doing one thing at a time, either. Ideally, I would fill out my tax return while watching a film; peel potatoes while reading the post; send emails in the bath. You can always recognise my restless peers and me; we are the people whose feet you hear tramping along the pavement at the other end of the phone line because we can only make calls while moving. Ideally, moving towards somewhere gruelling like the dentist\u2019s, the MOT testing station or a cocktail party.</p> <p>They say multitasking is a female trait but it\u2019s not about gender, it\u2019s about personality type. Some of us find \u201crelaxing\u201d to be, in itself, nerve-racking. If we aren\u2019t doing something useful, or at least that seems useful, we feel guilty, impatient and mortal.</p> <p>\u201cCan\u2019t just sit about here, enjoying the sunset!\u201d we think. \u201cNot when I haven\u2019t cleaned the fridge, answered those emails, started a pension, learned Japanese, got a haircut, bought loo paper <em>or</em> written a novel. I can do at least three of those things while appreciating the orange glow at the same time.\u2019</p> <p>People like us need to have tasks as hobbies or at least think of our hobbies as tasks. My husband always used to reflect admiringly on the loving way his mother allows his father to speak of the gardening as a terrible chore.</p> <p>\u201cThat lawn won\u2019t mow itself, Kathy!\u201d sighs my father-in-law, shaking his head as he abandons the sofa. \u201cAnd I suppose <em>someone</em> had better dead-head that cosmos.\u201d</p> <p>There\u2019s been less talk of that from my husband since he realised that he too would be required to cluck sympathetically throughout married life, as I scurry about saying: \u201cWell, if somebody doesn\u2019t make an apple pie then I think we\u2019re going to go hungry! No no, you stay there and enjoy your <em>Maigret</em>. I\u2019ve got to bleed the radiators anyway.\u201d</p> <p>And this conversation will be happening at two o\u2019clock in the morning.</p> <p>That\u2019s how I came to play poker professionally, rather than as an occasional social game: after a year or so, I couldn\u2019t allow myself to play it unless it was a source of income.</p> <p>That\u2019s how younger people turn \u201ccatching up with friends\u201d into \u201cgetting my social media updated\u201d. (<a href=\"http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/children-young-nine-check-mobile-8987171\" title=\"\">A study published last week found that some nine-year-olds are checking their smartphones up to 10 times during the night</a>. I understand those nine-year-olds. I am those nine-year-olds.)</p> <p>And that is why it\u2019s cruel to tell people that brain-training games do not train the brain. If they don\u2019t stave off cognitive decay, sharpen the memory or improve intellectual ability, then we\u2019re just\u2026 why, we\u2019re just sitting here playing sudoku!

Now we have had five, which reflects the rising popularity of these e-cigarettes,\u201d said hospital consultant plastic surgeon Dai Nguyen.</p> <p>Three of the patients treated at the hospital had their e-cigarette devices in their trouser pockets when they exploded. They include a 25-year-old who was paintballing at the time and a factory worker who suffered thigh and groin injuries, as well as burns to his hand, when he tried to extinguish the flames.</p> <p>The patients Nguyen has seen only suffered superficial burns and have made a good recovery, but she said: \u201cI am aware of other cases which have required surgery and skin grafts.</p> <p>\u201cThere have also been reports of e-cigarettes exploding in people\u2019s mouths, which resulted in catastrophic injuries similar to those you would experience if you were shot in the face with a gun.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>The seismic political upheavals triggered by June\u2019s calamitous vote to leave the European Union have greatly intensified in recent days, with the Tories at their conference in Birmingham following Labour and Ukip in a frantic, often divisive and persistently contradictory drive to identify and occupy the elusive \u201cnew centre ground\u201d of British politics.</p> <p>The most striking aspect of this struggle is that, in seeking to capitalise on the post-referendum state of flux, politicians in both main parties are paradoxically moving sharply away from the middle. In doing so, they set at risk fundamental liberal values and the universal, progressive principles that Britain, since the 18th-century Age of the Enlightenment, has been instrumental in spreading around the globe and in which its modern-day democracy and open society are rooted.</p> <p>Theresa May\u2019s first major speech as Conservative prime minister was intriguing for its renunciation of Thatcherism\u2019s pernicious but still pervasive emphasis on individualism and antisocial self-interest. Taken by itself, this public recanting is as welcome as it is overdue. May stressed instead <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/05/theresa-may-consigns-cameron-to-history-in-populist-speech\">her intention to use the power of government</a> to change and improve people\u2019s lives, lauding \u201cthe good the state can do\u201d.</p> <p>But in anointing herself as standard-bearer for the interests of what she patronisingly called \u201cordinary people\u201d, May tottered on the edge of the old Benthamite trap of suggesting she and her ministers know what is best for everyone. They should tread carefully. In a parliamentary democracy, overweening executive authority, convinced of its own moral rightness, is a creature to be feared, not admired, as America\u2019s founding fathers knew full well when they built checks and balances into the US constitution.</p> <p>Even as the Tories dream lazily of ruling in perpetuity, the rational parts of their brains must surely understand that May\u2019s old school, top-down, take-what\u2019s-good-for-you governance is neither desirable, democratic or effective. If May really believes they can become \u201cthe party of the workers, the party of public servants, the party of the NHS\u201d, she must learn to talk to those workers, not down to them \u2013 and listen before leaping on issues such as grammar schools and Hinkley Point.</p> <p>As a matter of respect and basic common sense, May should also heed the cautionary words of <a href=\"http://www.ushistory.org/paine/rights/singlehtml.htm\">Thomas Paine</a>, author of <em>The Rights of Man</em>, who wrote in 1792: \u201cMankind, as it appears to me, are always ripe enough to understand their true interest, provided it be presented clearly to their understanding, and that in a manner not to create suspicion by anything like self-design, nor offend by assuming too much. Where we would wish to reform we must not reproach.\u201d</p> <p>Worryingly, influential figures around May, pushing for a hard Brexit, are in danger of forgetting such wise maxims, assuming they were ever aware of them. What they call reform is unabashed regression and vengeful revisionism. There is a clear tendency, exhibited most brashly by Amber Rudd, the home secretary, and Liam Fox, the international trade secretary, to interpret the referendum result as unambiguous support for a divisive, rightwing agenda far removed from the political centre.</p> <p>It is worth restating that a thumping 48% of those who voted, or 16.1 million people, chose to Remain, while 28% of those eligible to vote expressed no opinion either way. That result places those actively backing Leave in a distinct minority. They should show a little humility. Instead, ignoring Paine and the majority, they assume too much. They dangerously overreach.</p> <p>Brexit did not, for example, provide a mandate for arbitrary restrictions on British-based companies hiring the best and brightest of foreign workers. In the integrated, globalised economy in which Fox claims a post-EU Britain will thrive, how shortsighted is that? Brexit was not a vote for British jobs for British workers, either,<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/oct/04/rudd-announces-crackdown-on-overseas-students-and-new-work-visas\"> despite what Rudd insultingly implied</a>. Many of the jobs in question are low skilled and badly paid; British-born workers simply do not want them. Some are demandingly high skilled, as in the NHS and care sectors, where there are critical shortages. Here, EU nationals perform vital work.</p> <p>Nor was Brexit a vote to trash one of modern Britain\u2019s great success stories \u2013 its internationally admired university sector \u2013 by limiting the numbers of foreign students who study here (and making it uncompetitively expensive for those who do). Already, the future of much joint research funding is in serious doubt. Notwithstanding vague government assurances about future financial support, Rudd\u2019s reckless comments will only compound damaging uncertainty.</p> <p>These and other noisome, ill-thought-out ideas, emanating from senior ministers bearing the seal of government, are as alarming as they are unpleasant. They carry a gross whiff of xenophobia. They convey an inescapable undertone of racism and intolerance. And they are a testament to what looks increasingly like an accelerating retreat from Britain\u2019s liberal, inclusive and open-minded tradition and a return to the narrow, delusional world of Little England.</p> <p>Despite much of what was said last week, Brexit was not a vote to scrap free access to the single market, thereby alienating Japanese and other overseas investors. Does Fox really think China, America or India will helpfully offer Britain, negotiating by itself, the same favourable terms that an EU bloc of 28 countries negotiating collectively has obtained? If he does, he should seek other work.</p> <p>Do these hard Brexiters truly believe our European partners will sit on their hands if Britain sets about demolishing EU founding pillars such as freedom of movement and goods? Do they honestly pretend Britain can continue to trade while rejecting agreed EU rules policed by the European court of justice?</p> <p>Do they somehow think British soldiers who commit war crimes should escape the sanction of European human rights conventions and international law? If they do, then dunderhead must be added to duplicity on the lengthening Brexiter charge sheet.</p> <p>Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, France\u2019s president, is a socialist, but no radical. He faces a fierce challenge from the hard right in next year\u2019s elections. Yet swiftly responding to the messages coming out of Birmingham, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/07/uk-must-pay-price-for-brexit-says-francois-hollande\">Hollande reacted sharply</a> last week. Britain must and will pay if it persists in such gratuitous vandalism, Hollande said.</p> <p>Viewed from the French, German and Italian mainstream, there is less and less to distinguish hard Brexiters from Marine Le Pen\u2019s extremist Front National (which enthusiastically eggs them on) or the similarly xenophobic, nationalist Alternative for Germany. They are wreckers. They are reckless. They are irresponsible. They know only what they do not like. And they have little or no practical idea how they will replace the hard-won principles and institutions they traduce.</p> <p>Whatever these delusional Tories believe, theirs is not the path to Britain\u2019s new centre ground. Yet Labour, too, seems to have wholly lost its way as it struggles with internal divisions and the mortal threat to its working-class heartlands posed by Ukip.</p> <p>Rarely has the country required a purposeful, effective opposition as badly as it does now. Rarely if ever has there been such urgent need of a champion ready to defend workers\u2019 rights, regardless of race or nationality, to fight for the values of tolerance, inclusion and equality embodied in the European treaties and to lead those who feel threatened by mass migration, job insecurity, poverty and globalisation towards a broader understanding of who their real enemies are.</p> <p>Stand up, Jeremy Corbyn, newly re-elected Labour leader. Except, on Europe, the defining issue of our time, Corbyn has consistently failed to stand up, show a lead or demonstrate an appreciation of the wider issues. Yes, more social housing is important. Yes, a higher minimum would be nice. Yes, the railways are a mess. But this is hardly the point.</p> <p>Without a prosperous economy and expanding tax take, such policies will remain as unfunded wishful thinking. And if a hard Brexit takes hold, pushed through arbitrarily from next March onwards while a <a href=\"http://www.economist.com/news/britain/21701333-culpability-jeremy-corbyn\">blinkered Corbyn</a> vainly squabbles with his MPs and parliament is sidelined, much current public spending may be at risk, let alone any new programmes.</p> <p>Corbyn must now demonstrate that he is the man to rise to this pre-eminently urgent national challenge. The line of attack is clear. It is not unpatriotic, as May &amp; co perniciously suggest, to want this country to remain close to the EU and play as full a part as possible within Europe. It is not supercilious or elitist to suggest many Leave voters were egregiously misled about the consequences of Brexit by Nigel Farage, Boris Johnson and Michael Gove. It is only right to be concerned that this new administration is using Brexit as a means to foist a divisive rightwing agenda on the country. It is deeply worrying that, as a result, the Brexit process may be botched and our national interests, and our people, will consequently suffer across the board.</p> <p>On one point, all perhaps can agree: this political crisis is about taking back control. But Brussels is not the enemy. The EU was always a straw man. Nor is the crisis about a loss of community, native culture and traditions, as some maintain. In all respects, these aspects of our national life are thriving, although they are evolving in ways some conservatives do not like.</p> <p>No, this crisis is about reasserting and deepening democratic governance on behalf of all the people while limiting the control and excesses of those who, by one means or another, exercise power over us.</p> <p>Just as in the time of Tom Paine and the American and French revolutions, it is a battle for equality, justice and tolerance, for the proud liberal principles of individual freedom, openness and inclusion. It is a struggle between the forces of reaction, prejudice, ignorance, dogmatism and self-interest and the universal vision of progressive societies in which the rights of all men and women are respected and advanced. It is an ongoing historical contest that everyone who cares about a fairer society must now steel themselves to fight again \u2013 and by all means, win. For here, not on Brexit\u2019s wilder shores, is where Britain\u2019s centre ground truly lies.</p> <ul> <li><em>This article was amended on 22 October 2016 to clarify EU Referendum voting percentages.</em><br></li> </ul>",

Although it is widely accepted that there are traffickers in the camp, only 50 places for asylum-seeking children are available at nearby French centres.</p> <p>Alex Fraser, director of refugee support at the British Red Cross, the largest provider of support to refugees and asylum seekers in the UK, said: \u201cChildren, who could be rebuilding their lives in safety with their only surviving relatives, are being left to fend for themselves in conditions unimaginable to most adults.</p> <p>\u201cWith the forthcoming evictions in Calais, these bureaucratic problems are now more pressing than ever. We need to see urgency from both the UK and French governments. Children with a legal right to be here should be on the Eurostar across the Channel, not being dispersed somewhere else in France.\u201d</p> <p>A Home Office spokesperson said: \u201cIt is wholly false to say that we have not accepted responsibility for asylum applications submitted by the French authorities for unaccompanied children with family members in the UK.

  "<p>In Crieff on Friday morning on the second day of the annual conference of Scotland\u2019s local authorities an otherwise unremarkable panel session took place to discuss local government reform. In the middle of the proceedings, Willie Rennie, the Scottish Lib Dems\u2019 leader who always looks like a small-town bank manager about to admonish an old customer for his prodigal spending habits, threw out a challenge to the audience. \u201cAre there any SNP members here who want to put a question of the government,\u201d he asked.</p> <p>The government was represented on the panel by Derek Mackay, the recently appointed finance minister. To the surprise of no one in the room the silence of the grave rapidly descended. There were plenty of SNP members present but, as everyone in Scottish politics knows, any nationalists who valued a future in the party would rather go dooking for chips in a deep fat fryer than question its financial husbandry. Rennie\u2019s interjection was timely and pertinent. In a Scotland dominated by the SNP on every political level the task of maintaining the daily conduct of democracy, the practice of holding central government to account, falls a little more heavily on the shoulders of those party members who have been elected to office. Rennie\u2019s challenge to the SNP faithful came just a few hours after it had been announced that <a href=\"http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/14787827.SNP_by_election_victory_in_Labour_heartland_signals_power_shift_in_Glasgow/?ref=rl&amp;lp=2\">their party had taken the council ward of Garscadden and Scotstounhill</a> in the north-west of Glasgow.</p> <p>This area, long a Labour stronghold, was furiously contested as each side sensed that the outcome would act as a weathervane pointing to the overall outcome of next May\u2019s local authority elections. The SNP have coveted control of Glasgow city council since they came to power nationally in 2007. At the 2012 local elections the SNP were just beginning to break out the champagne in Glasgow when it was announced that Labour, against all the odds and the prevailing nationalist headwind, had managed to hold on to the most prized of its municipal jewels.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/oct/06/scotland-bans-underground-coal-gasification-ugc\">Scotland bans controversial gas extraction technique</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Since then though, all the indications have suggested that the SNP has virtually annexed the city. In 2014, Glasgow was only one of four Scottish local authority areas to vote Yes in the independence referendum. The following year, every one of the city\u2019s seven Westminster seats fell to the SNP, in the fierce after-shock of the constitutional division. And although Labour recovered a little lost ground in Glasgow in this year\u2019s Holyrood elections, the momentum is firmly with the nationalists. If they do take Glasgow then their writ will effectively run in every important area of Scotland. This is why Rennie\u2019s challenge is such a pertinent one.</p> <p>Tories have made much of their elevation to become the official opposition at Holyrood and there has been much silly talk about the emergence of their leader Ruth Davidson as a credible future first minister. In reality though, Davidson has been a major disappointment at Holyrood. She has failed adequately to distance herself from the hard right, which has annexed the UK Conservative party at Westminster with its sinister anti-immigration views. Her policy programme begins and ends with opposing a second referendum in independence. She charges the SNP with obsessing about independence; in truth though, no one is more obsessed by it than she and it has made her position as leader of the opposition faintly ridiculous.</p> <p>It is virtually certain that the government of Scotland will remain in the hands of the SNP for a generation, yet already this party is beginning to fall into the same bad habits that finally did for Labour in Scotland. They talk a great deal but so far have delivered little. At the local authority conference, Mackay, whose performance was described as lacklustre and predictable, could only say that people had to be prepared to pay more if they wanted improved public services. Not a scintilla of fresh or innovative thinking in funding models, which the much-lauded community empowerment bill might have been expected to open up.</p> <p>Mackay was saying this even as it was being revealed that the NHS 24 computer project has experienced a <a href=\"http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/14787758.Future_of_NHS_24_in_doubt_as_crisis_hit_IT_project_costs_soar_by_73_/\">73% hike in cost to more than \u00a3130m</a>. Elsewhere it was revealed that <a href=\"http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/14787747.Crisis_hit_Scots_NHS_board_has__no_plan__to_deal_with___11_6m_budget_deficit__says_auditor/\">NHS Tayside needs to make \u00a358m of savings</a> following years of government bail-outs. ScotRail, the national rail operator has long been a national disgrace. Last week it was revealed that its Dutch owners Abellio has admitted making <a href=\"http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/14762449.Abellio_making___1_million_profit_a_month_from_ScotRail_franchise/\">so much money from the deal</a> that it can plough the profits back into its Netherlands operation. Despite all of this, the SNP have become politically untouchable. Yet Labour is in no position to land a single blow.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/oct/06/hard-brexit-could-see-scotland-lose-80000-jobs-and-cost-2000-a-head\">Hard Brexit could cost Scotland \u00a32,000 a head and 80,000 jobs</a> </p> </aside>  <p>No matter how you try to crunch the numbers from Thursday\u2019s by election they convey disquietude for Labour. Certainly, the turnout at 24% was ridiculously low and the margin of victory slim, but it still represented a 20% swing to the SNP. In 2012, Labour gained 60% of the city vote. If the SNP do take Glasgow next year it will be less of a testament to its popularity and competence than the utter failure of Scottish Labour to engage at any level with voters. They really ought not to be losing so much ground in Scotland\u2019s biggest city. The SNP\u2019s antipathy to Glasgow is both real and historic.</p> <p>This city, which has suffered disproportionately from re-drawn local authority boundaries and health inequality, continues to drive Scotland\u2019s economy. Yet the SNP annually cuts its Holyrood block grant while throwing a third of Scotland\u2019s overall budget at a failing health service, which excels only at the rate at which it has increased managerialism and secured the financial futures of the children of thousands of NHS executives. Glasgow is lamentably under-represented at cabinet level in the SNP government. The neglect of Glasgow by the SNP should be on every Labour councillor seeking re-election next May.</p> <p>On 10 October, Glasgow will reveal its blueprint for thriving in the face of Brexit uncertainty. The theme of this fightback document will be Glasgow is Open For Business. It\u2019s not dissimilar to London\u2019s response but it doesn\u2019t have the vast riches that make it easier for the English capital. If Glasgow can convey and then maintain a sense of optimism in the face of Brexit and of deploying its gifts for innovation laughing in the face of adversity the SNP threat may yet be put to flight.</p>",
  "<p>Stephen Daldry\u2019s 2000 film <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/billy-elliot\" title=\"\"><em>Billy Elliot</em></a> was a Bafta-winning critical and commercial hit. His 2005 stage musical version of the story about a working-class boy who wants to be a ballet dancer has been seen by 11 million people.

Daldry wants to be more troublesome, less mainstream, than that.</p> <p>Next month he will have another go at rocking the cultural boat. Not content with an esteemed career in the world of film, making <em>The Hours</em> and <em>Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close</em>, or a recent theatrical triumph on both sides of the Atlantic with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2013/mar/05/the-audience-review-helen-mirren\" title=\"\"><em>The Audience</em></a>, the play with Helen Mirren as the Queen, the 56-year-old has now created the most expensive television drama of all time \u2013 and possibly the most ambitious.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/aug/21/different-kind-of-royal-fever-victoria-the-crown-jenna-coleman\" title=\"\"><em>The Crown</em></a>, telling the story of Elizabeth II from 1947 to the present day, will launch on 4 November on Netflix and has already been hailed by critics as the television drama series that will blast through established viewing habits, drawing older audiences away from traditional channels. Awarded five stars by reviewers on the <em>Times</em> and the <em>Telegraph</em>, it is a forensic examination of the politics and personal dramas negotiated by the royal family and, at a rumoured cost of \u00a3100m, marks the American subscription service\u2019s big push into new audiences. \u201cThey are expanding, both in the number of people who are subscribing, and into territories like Australia and India. I assume that is why they responded to our request,\u201d said Daldry. One of the \u201cgreat joys\u201d, he adds, of working for Netflix is the creative freedom. \u201cThere were no anxieties in the area of editorial control, not that we set out to do a hatchet job on the royal family by any stretch of the imagination.\u201d</p> <p>The atmosphere at the production\u2019s Elstree base has been close to a backstage theatrical experience, he says, puffing cigarette smoke enthusiastically over the roof of the Young Vic theatre in London, where he is advising on Isango Ensemble\u2019s new show, <em>A Man of Good Hope</em>. \u201cNetflix have been a fantastic company to work for. I have never been in a more convivial and happy production team.

You might get certain break-out movies, but online streaming of drama has altered the whole thing. You can subscribe and see 40 TV shows, or go out to the cinema for a night for the same money.\u201d</p> <p>Daldry might seem like a creative nomad, moving on from one medium and from one theme to another, but it is possible to spot the social concerns that crop up in his work. Both Priestley\u2019s morality puzzle and <em>The Crown</em> are rooted in postwar Britain. Although the play is set before the first world war, it was first performed in London at the New Theatre, now the No\u00ebl Coward, at the moment the young Princess Elizabeth was preparing for marriage. It is an era the director says he finds hard to view as a \u201cperiod\u201d setting. Instead, he says that both the venerable stage play and his new television series, written by Peter Morgan, strive to represent the real world we live in, rather than a past where \u201cthey do things differently\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cNeither of them are really like costume dramas,\u201d Daldry says. \u201cWith <em>The Crown</em> we are attentive to detail, but it is not one of those dramas where you look at the dresses. I hope it doesn\u2019t feel like one of those.\u201d As with <em>An Inspector Calls</em>, the issues in <em>The Crown</em> feel contemporary, to say nothing of the bad language (the King swears at full throttle in the first five minutes) or of the focus on gritty subjects such as Anthony Eden\u2019s drug addiction.</p> <p>Daldry says he does not watch costume drama. \u201cI don\u2019t know why. I am not knocking it. I haven\u2019t seen ITV\u2019s <em>Victoria</em> yet. I did try to watch <em>Downton</em> on an aeroplane, but it is not really my thing.\u201d</p> <p>What he does find interesting, he says, is the anthropology of class, of royalty and of the church.</p> <p>\u201cPriestley wrote <em>An Inspector Calls</em> as part of that huge shift in postwar consensus, the wakening of a social conscience. He wrote it as political agitation, so people would not go back to Edwardian values, and when we first did it Margaret Thatcher was talking about returning to prewar values. Whenever you watch the play it seems to be politically relevant. It feels urgent in different ways. I first intended the chorus who come on carrying bundles to be the people of 1945, but when we did it in Dartford at the beginning of the year they suddenly looked like dispossessed refugees.\u201d</p> <p>It is odd revisiting a show he directed 24 years ago, Daldry says. \u201cI am now in my late 50s and am wondering whether I would do the audacious risk-taking now.\u201d He wonders if he might have been harder on the royals then: \u201cI have more respect because I know so much more now. Who knew Prince Philip (played by Matt Smith ) was a radical reformer who really did want to modernise them?\u201d</p> <p>Morgan and Daldry\u2019s original idea, born of their work on <em>The Audience</em>, was to \u201ccontinue the study of a family that weren\u2019t born to be the royal family of England and look at all the tensions and trials they go through\u201d. Daldry found it extraordinary just how much of their lives were discussed in cabinet sessions. \u201cOur rule was that the TV show would be about everything that became a constitutional crisis, not just the aborted engagement of Princess Margaret, but it broadened out a bit. We have fantastic researchers on the show, but we have deliberately had no contact with the palace. We always know when we are departing from the absolute truth, and of course no one knows the dialogue, so what you get of course is an imaginative interpretation. Peter describes it as <em>The Sopranos</em> meets <em>The West Wing</em>.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I haven't seen ITV's Victoria yet.

With 10 episodes of the first season of <em>The Crown</em> made, he is working on season two in Hungary, where Budapest will stand in for Germany and viewers will meet Prince Philip\u2019s family (many married to Nazis).</p> <p>Aside from the Young Vic show, and the work with the three new cast members joining <em>An Inspector Calls</em> for the West End run, he is in New York frequently. Not only do his children go to school there, he is working on two high-profile arts building projects, Pier 55 and the new performance centre on the site of Ground Zero. He has also just returned from a UN assembly \u201cglobal exchange\u201d session, which he attended with fellow members of the board of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/mar/19/calais-refugee-camp-theatre-british-playwrights\" title=\"\">Good Chance</a> theatre company, working with people in the Calais refugee camp.</p> <p>Rather than being overstretched, Daldry is, he claims, \u201cthrilled by all the connections\u201d he sees in his varied projects. While the play at the Young Vic deals with the violent reaction to the Somali refugee crisis in South Africa, the director is also working in a climate heavily weighted with reaction to refugees who have flown in the other direction, north to Europe. \u201cAt the moment <em>Billy Elliot</em> is getting an incredible response in Edinburgh when the show talks about the collapse of community or the attack on union rights. People yell out. I love it when <em>An Inspector Calls</em> feels radical too. Sometimes people applaud in unexpected places.\u201d</p> <p>Finding quite such a radical resonance in his next film project, <em>Wicked: The Movie</em>, may be a bigger ask, but Daldry may well try.</p> <h2>THE TOP FIVE</h2> <p><strong>An Inspector Calls 1992</strong><br>Daldry\u2019s production of Priestley\u2019s play for the National Theatre is still going.

For the past 36 years, \u2013 more than a generation \u2013 our prime ministers have been centre-right. We\u2019ve forgotten our centre-left politics. And in case you want to call Tony Blair centre-left, remember the senior Tory who, when asked what was Margaret Thatcher\u2019s greatest legacy, replied: New Labour.</p> <p>As prime minister, Jeremy Corbyn would introduce secure jobs with a living wage, the repeal of the Trade Union Act, greater funding for the NHS and public services, the renationalisation of the railways, national and regional investment banks to finance the regeneration of British industry and commerce, action on tax avoidance and evasion and measures to close the gap between rich and poor.</p> <p>The reason the media feel free to demonise Corbyn as extreme left, a view shared by 172 Labour MPs and, according to the polls, the majority of the British electorate, is that we\u2019ve forgotten the postwar Labour tradition. The above policies would have found favour with Attlee, Wilson and Callaghan. Indeed, one of them featured in Mrs May\u2019s acceptance speech.

  "<p>Words do things to people. And the most potent words, the ones that have a direct line to the emotions, are profanity. Profane words uniquely allow you to express pain or cause it in others. They peerlessly demonstrate frustration, anger or emphasis. But let\u2019s be specific. I mean words such as cocksucker. Or fuck.</p> <p>These are among the taboo words of English that elicit the strongest measurable physiological reactions \u2013 the fastest pulse, the sweatiest palms, the shallowest breath. These words are versatile. Name a feeling and profanity can elicit it. Profanity can increase sexual arousal. It can increase your ability to withstand pain (compare the analgesic effect of yelling \u201cfuck!\u201d when you hammer your thumb with the effect of yelling \u201cduck!\u201d).</p> <p>When deployed appropriately, profanity can cause delight; countless comedians stake their professional lives on the impact of \u201cworking blue\u201d. But when miscalibrated, the use of the very same words can make you seem crude, uneducated or out of control. In their darkest incarnation, profane words can be part of verbal abuse and they can denigrate and disempower people. (See Trump\u2019s \u201cgrab them by the pussy\u201d.) And because these words have such an outsize impact, we ban them. We chastise children for using them and fine or arrest adults who use them around children. Because the words are just too powerful.</p> <p>What makes a word profane? Looking at English as it manifests itself across the world, we see hints of both consistency and variability. English profanity tends to be drawn from four categories of words. The word profanity originally referred to the first group. In Latin, <em>profanus</em> literally means \u201coutside the temple\u201d, denoting words or acts that desecrate the holy.</p> <p>For some people, the use of religious words in secular ways constitutes blasphemy \u2013 a sin against religious doctrine \u2013 and this is the pathway that makes those terms taboo. The names of religious figures, such as Jesus Christ, Jehovah or Muhammad, are easy fodder. So are aspects of religious dogma. In English, we have a few of these, such as holy, hell, God, damn. There are also older English curse words that have fallen out of favour, such as \u201cgadzooks\u201d, from God\u2019s hooks (the nails used in the Crucifixion). The first place English profanity originates is the sacred.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>For contemporary English speakers, the worst words are derogatory terms  based on their ethnicity</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The second is in language relating to sex and sexual acts. This includes the acts themselves, sex organs, people who perform those acts and artefacts and effluvia related to those acts. So the second prong of our profanity principle is sex.</p> <p>Third is language involving other bodily functions \u2013 things that come out of your body, the process of expelling them and the parts of your body they come out of. This includes robust cohorts of words describing faeces, urine and vomit, among others, as well as the associated body parts and the artefacts used in the upkeep of those body parts, such as douchebag.</p> <p>Finally there are the slurs. Among the most offensive words in the Anglophone world are words made offensive by dint of their derogatory reference to people based on a group they\u2019re perceived to belong to, defined in terms of sex, sexual orientation, ethnicity, religion and so on.</p> <p>Looking just at English, you\u2019ll find that nearly all the most profane words in Great Britain, New Zealand and the United States fall into one of these four categories: praying, fornicating, excreting and slurring. Can this pattern be generalised? If it captures something about human nature or about the inevitable evolution of cultural systems, then you\u2019d expect it to apply broadly.</p> <p>Alternatively, English speakers might be a breed apart, uniquely obsessed with religion, copulation, bodily functions and social groups. If you pick your favourite language other than English, how does profanity work? What\u2019s profane in Cantonese? How about Finnish? Pretty well. Most of the profane vocabulary in most languages that have accessible documentation is drawn from one of these four categories. That\u2019s not to say there aren\u2019t local exceptions. One is language about animals \u2013 calling someone a dog in Korea is deeply offensive, for example. Disease often creeps into profanity and a salient example is Dutch, which counts among its strong profanities words for cancer, typhoid and tuberculosis. But for the most part, when a language and culture designate a stable set of words as profane \u2013 where the words themselves are deemed inappropriate and offensive \u2013 these largely fall into the four categories.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6ec4c04546c35ca98b2db4d0fedf7a6cd68ab6ad\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6ec4c04546c35ca98b2db4d0fedf7a6cd68ab6ad/0_88_2316_1389/1000.jpg\" alt=\"In Korea, calling someone a dog is deeply offensive.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">In Korea, calling someone a dog is deeply offensive.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Richard Rayner/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Curiously, though, not all languages hew to the principle in the same proportions. Quebecois French makes heavy use of what it calls <em>sacres</em> (\u201cconsecrations\u201d): strong profanities related to Catholicism and Catholic liturgical concepts. Far stronger than <em>merde</em> (\u201cshit\u201d) or <em>foutre </em>(\u201cfuck\u201d) in Quebec are <em>tabarnack</em> (\u201ctabernacle\u201d), <em>calisse </em>(\u201cchalice\u201d) and <em>calvaire</em> (\u201cCalvary\u201d). This is despite, or due to, the fact that Quebeckers have largely lost their religion. Sexual language is more pervasive. A good example is Cantonese, which uses words for the act of copulation like <em>diu </em>or relevant body parts, as its strongest terms.</p> <p>But not English. The bulk of the words that contemporary native speakers consider worst are derogatory terms for individuals or groups, especially ones based on their ethnicity. In English, these slurs are not only based on ethnicity but also on sexual orientation, immigration status and health condition.</p> <p>Ultimately, two things are clear. First, languages tend to draw from similar domains for their profanity. That suggests that the forces that make words become profane in English may be present across human experience, regardless of native language. And second, despite similarities across languages, cultural idiosyncrasies do play a role in shaping how profanity in a language will work and be distributed. Languages spoken by people with a cultural history of uniform religious practice (for instance, Catholicism) can become populated with holy profanity \u2013words for heaven and hell and saints and demons. If you were clever, you might even say that when it comes to cultural differences in profanity, the devil is in the detail. Or maybe not.</p> <p><em>Benjamin Bergen is professor of cognitive science, University of San Diego, and author of </em>What The F: What Swearing Reveals about Our Language, Our Brains and Ourselves</p>",
  "<p>Around the world, people are looking to the recent meeting in Johannesburg of the <a href=\"https://www.cites.org/\" title=\"\">Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species</a> to help end the elephant and rhino poaching crisis. This hope is misplaced.</p> <p>The convention is, by definition, about legal trade in endangered species. It determines what species of animals and plants can be traded by law-abiding nations and citizens. The poaching crisis, conversely, is about illegal trade and is driven by individuals and entities that are not bothered by the niceties of law, much less relatively toothless international conventions. (This is not to say that Cites is irrelevant to the poaching crisis. Sadly, Cites has an important and unfortunate indirect impact on illegal trade by creating conditions and sending messages to the marketplace that inadvertently help promote a parallel, illegal trade.)</p> <p>This is why there is overwhelming consensus among mainstream, science-based conservation organisations that legal ivory trade should be ended for good. When ivory is not for sale, and when it becomes socially unacceptable to own it, then the potential and the incentive to trade illegal ivory will also disappear.</p> <p>The story of conservation in Africa, typified by the African elephant, has been one of constant retreat. The elephant has ceaselessly been driven into ever-smaller parks and reserves, dwindling to ever-lower populations. In the early 1970s, Africa had an estimated 1.3m elephants. The first great poaching and trafficking crisis at the end of the century saw the \u201ccontinental herd\u201d reduced by more than half to approximately 600,000. The current crisis is on track to halve the population yet again.</p> <p>While it is true that there are a few examples of threatened wildlife species that have begun rebuilding after dramatic declines, namely the white rhino and the mountain gorilla, these rates of rebound can only be considered impressive from a low base \u2013 a mere 200 to 300 individuals at the nadir. Must we really go so close to the edge before humanity acknowledges their potential loss and only then generates the collective will to act?</p> <p>Even after the present crisis, Africa\u2019s wildlife still faces an extremely challenging future. The continent now has the youngest and fastest-growing human population in the world. Cities are expanding. International agencies and companies are seeking a massive expansion in African agriculture.</p> <p>Long overdue infrastructure, including ports, highways and railways, is being built. But all of that comes with a potential conservation price. So is all lost? I don\u2019t believe so. The <a href=\"http://www.awf.org/\" title=\"\">African Wildlife Foundation</a> exists to actively promote and advocate for a future in which large and representative populations of wildlife continue to exist in an increasingly modern and prosperous Africa. We believe that Africa must not become one big game park and that to ensure the future of Africa\u2019s wild places, conservation planning must be managed in a way that benefits Africans themselves.</p> <p>Priority areas must be set aside and vigorously defended against short-term commercial exploitation. African nations, the regional economic blocs and Africa as a whole should establish specific numeric goals to stabilise the \u201ccontinental herd\u201d of elephant and the \u201ccontinental pride\u201d of lion, as well as many other species at reasonable, viable, resilient numbers, which realistically can coexist alongside modern society.</p> <p>With political will, planning and foresight, it should be possible for Africa to have livable modern cities, well-planned infrastructure, productive farmlands, industrial parks for manufacturing and jobs, while retaining the Serengeti, the Okavango delta, the Kalahari desert, the Congo basin forest and other very large natural systems with their resident wildlife.</p> <p>These areas will remain critical for climate change mitigation, water catchment, support for the agricultural economy and both domestic and international tourism.</p> <p>While supporting voices are welcome, the political will to conserve Africa\u2019s natural heritage cannot be generated from London, New York or Hollywood. The new young, tech-savvy, increasingly urban generation of African citizens must value and become the strongest advocates for their continent\u2019s unique wildlife heritage.</p> <p><em>Patrick Bergin is the CEO of the African Wildlife Foundation</em></p>",

Wiggins had received injections of the corticosteroid triamcinolone to combat pollen allergies, taken just before major Tours in 2011, 2012 and 2013, but they were within the rules and British Cycling seemed largely untouched by the questions that had thrown up.</p> <p>Late on Thursday night and into Friday, however, there was a change of pace when it was revealed that UK Anti\u2011Doping had begun an investigation into \u201callegations of wrongdoing in cycling\u201d, and it was later confirmed that two members of Ukad staff attended a meeting with British Cycling on Friday.</p> <p>Ukad was keen to clarify that \u201cat no point have Ukad \u2018raided\u2019 British Cycling or Team Sky\u201d. The meeting, Ukad stated, was with the full cooperation of British&#xa0;Cycling.</p> <p>Wiggins stated early on Saturday through his official spokesman that \u201cI welcome this investigation\u201d although he was not planning on expanding on that. Team Sky followed that up with a statement on Saturday lunchtime that read: \u201cGiven some of the recent headlines we wanted to set out the facts. Team Sky were recently contacted by the <em>Daily Mail</em> regarding an allegation of wrongdoing which we strongly refute. We informed British Cycling and asked them to contact UK Anti-Doping. We understand that Ukad are currently investigating this as you would expect.\u201d</p> <p>The investigation was not directly related to Wiggins\u2019s TUEs, but instead followed the revelation that a package containing \u201ca medical substance\u201d was delivered to Team Sky by a British Cycling coach, Simon Cope \u2013 who is now the director sportif of Wiggins\u2019s eponymous professional team \u2013 at the Crit\u00e9rium du Dauphin\u00e9 stage race in 2011 and that the recipient was the doctor responsible for Wiggins\u2019s TUE applications in 2011, 2012 and 2013, Richard Freeman, who is the British Cycling team doctor. He will not travel to Qatar with the team for the world road race championships.</p> <p>The Ukad investigation caps a period when immense success for British Cycling has been accompanied by massive turbulence, beginning with the allegations of sexism and discrimination against the technical director, Shane Sutton, which culminated in Sutton\u2019s departure. An inquiry into the background to this chain of events is still ongoing, although it is expected to report before the British Cycling National Council meeting at the end of November. There is constant speculation about Sutton\u2019s possible return to the fold.</p> <p>The Sutton debacle was followed by the dramatic news that the world champion Lizzie Armitstead had come close to missing the Rio Olympic Games after registering three \u201cstrikes\u201d on the ADAMS system that monitors a cyclist\u2019s whereabouts for random testing. Armitstead was cleared a few weeks after her third \u201cstrike\u201d when the court of arbitration for sport ruled that the first \u201cstrike\u201d was not valid as doping control officers had not made proper attempts to contact her, but it made for an embarrassing run-in to the Olympic Games.</p> <p>The pendulum swung the other way immediately with Armitstead almost forgotten by the time the British topped the cycling medal table in Rio with twice as many medals as their closest competitor, Holland. On the back of that, HSBC committed to backing the sport for eight years, replacing Sky as BC\u2019s principal&#xa0;sponsor.</p> <p>The mood at the velodrome, insiders say, is one of frustration with the latest run of destabilising events, given that British Cycling has grown spectacularly over the past 20 years, from the point when it was truly in crisis in the mid\u20111990s to its current flagship status with a glut of medals and more than 125,000 members. Up and down the country, local cycling events are booming, even at the bottom end of the competitive spectrum.</p> <p>Given that no one can predict where all this will end, it is hard to speculate about their long\u2011term&#xa0;impact.</p> <p>Next week, Armitstead \u2013 now Lizzie Deignan after her marriage in September \u2013 and other GB team members will be at the world championships. There, on Wednesday, the venue for the 2019 world road titles will be announced, and there is a strong chance that they will be awarded to Yorkshire. In turn, that would be accompanied by a massive investment in racing infrastructure around the country, a game changer according to British Cycling.</p> <p>The contrast between events back home and events far away will be acute given the obvious questions about the sport\u2019s long-term ability to weather what might not be a crisis but something that resembles Callaghan\u2019s mounting&#xa0;chaos.</p>",

  "<p>The difference between the Champions Cup and the old Heineken Cup is revealed by a glance at the pools, now five groups instead of six. There used to be one pool of death but now it is a case of a single pool of life, which tends to be the one that involves the Italian representatives.</p> <p>Wasps are the Premiership club fortunate to have drawn Zebre, who have lost by 54 and 44 points at Ospreys and Munster this season, along with Connacht, who have made a stuttering start to the defence of their Pro12 title, and Toulouse, the most successful club in the history of the European Cup with four titles but who have made the knockout stage only once in the last four seasons.</p> <p>It is one of four pools to contain two former winners. Leicester and Munster are grouped together as are Toulon and Saracens, who meet at Stade F\u00e9lix Mayol on Saturday in probably the most compelling of any opening-round fixture yet.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/oct/06/the-breakdown-australia-argentina-twickenham\">Will northern exposure help southern hemisphere nations cool their losses? | The Breakdown</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Northampton and Leinster, who <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2011/may/21/leinster-northampton-heineken-cup\" title=\"\">in 2011 showed a final need not be a dull</a>, no-risk affair, have a double-header in December.

They were one of three English clubs to make the semi-final stage, along with the Tigers and Wasps, and at a time of Brexit, they are anxious to make Europe a single market.</p> <p>The two previous winners of the tournament, Leinster and Toulon, both retained the trophy at least once, a feat only Leicester had achieved before, but the club that swept all before them last season is making no predictions.</p> <p>\u201cYou cannot go into a tournament like this thinking about retaining the trophy,\u201d says Mark McCall, the Saracens director of rugby.\u201d Your focus is getting out of your pool and you are not looking beyond that. You have to pick up every point you can and you have to fight for everything. We know that, if we get into the play-offs, we will have a chance if we are healthy as a squad but getting there is a tall order.\u201d</p> <p>Toulon, who lost to Racing 92, the team Saracens defeated to win the Champions Cup last May, in the Top 14 final, have made a slow start to the season, losing at Bayonne and at home to Brive to leave the club\u2019s owner, Mourad Boudjellal, wondering aloud whether it was time to get out of rugby and count what was left of his fortune. But they have also recorded some notable victories, at home to the previously unbeaten Clermont and the Challenge Cup holders, Montpellier, after a 32-15 triumph at Toulouse.</p> <p>\u201cTheir squad is a rugby who\u2019s who,\u201d says McCall. \u201cToulon is a brilliant place to play rugby, one of the most atmospheric grounds in Europe. They have never lost at home in the Champions Cup and it will be a hell of a task for us.</p> <p>\u201cLast season was not our only really successful one. We have had a strong seven years and have been very consistent in the last three. We have appeared in five of the last six finals in Europe and the Premiership, which is a considerable achievement, but I do not get the sense that people here are satisfied. They want more; there is a real hunger in the group. Everything, though, is getting harder.\u201d</p> <p>There have been only 11 winners of the tournament as it enters its 22nd year and while a debate now is whether England can enjoy a period of dominance after significant increases in the salary cap in the Premiership. Toulon\u2019s three-year run of success spawned the theory that the riches of the Top 14 would leave the other leagues trailing and before that, as Ireland provided the champions in four out of five seasons, the notion was that the lack of relegation in the Pro12 meant that teams could rest their top players, who would be fresh for Europe and give their sides an advantage over the English and French clubs.</p> <p>History shows the balance of power has been broadly equal. France has supplied eight champions, England seven and the Pro12 six, all Irish. While Zebre\u2019s cause seems hopeless and that of the Scarlets, Wales\u2019s only team this season after Ospreys failed to finish high enough in the Pro12 to qualify, not much rosier after an unimpressive start to the campaign, Ulster, Munster and Leinster look stronger than last season and Glasgow will expect to beat Leicester on the opening night of the tournament at Scotstoun Stadium this Friday.</p> <p>Two of the five top seeds are from the Pro 12, Connacht and Leinster, as well as two of the bottom five, Munster and Zebre. \u201cYou look for the easy games in your pool and when you examine this group you quickly realise that you are the easy game,\u201d says Munster\u2019s director of rugby, Rassie Erasmus, as he contemplated facing Racing \u2013 who last week were forced to defend doping claims against three of their players, including Dan Carter \u2013 Glasgow and Leicester. \u201cWe have to change that perception.\u201d Let the mind games begin.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/oct/07/dan-carter-joe-rokocoko-tue-doping-tests\">Dan Carter and Joe Rokocoko \u2018had TUEs\u2019 for substances found in doping tests</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It is a case of let the games commence for Schalk Burger, the South Africa flanker who joined Saracens this season having watched previous tournaments on television. \u201cQuite a few South Africans have been involved in it in recent years and it is always good to check on your mates,\u201d he says before the reunion in Toulon with Bryan Habana, Duane Vermeulen and the injured Juan Smith. \u201cIt will be a different story when we face each other and I have always thought the tournament to be a phenomenal one.</p> <p>\u201cI like the way it is played in blocks of a couple of weeks, high on intensity. It is different from Super Rugby which has now become such a long season. The best competition I played in was the old Super 12 which was played over three months with the best players in the southern hemisphere condensed into a dozen teams; the quality is diluted now and playing in the Champions Cup has been an ambition of mine for a while having watched it on the TV for so long.</p> <p>\u201cSuper Rugby is about high tempo, dominating the ball, with referees favouring the attacking team, and most matches are played in great conditions. The game in Europe is more attritional with the focus on how you exit, get territory and put teams under pressure. The emphasis in the south is on skill set and skill execution; here there is more of a technical focus.</p> <p>\u201cI am enjoying it at Saracens, a club where there are very high standards and massive expectation. We cannot get ahead of ourselves: no game, or season, is perfect. Each week you try and take a step forward. We will need to do that in the next six days with one big game against Wasps followed by another in Toulon; it will be about how we manage the energy.\u201d</p>",

Attracting foreign students \u2013 and foreign expertise in teaching and research \u2013 is a key source of revenue for British universities.</p> <p>Another well-beaten trail into <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2015/apr/23/are-international-students-getting-a-raw-deal\">British institutions comes from India</a>, where people are now thinking twice about going to the UK, said Falguni Laheru, a solicitor at immigration law firm SmartMove4Visas. \u201c[Indians] have come to expect immigration updates with a mixture of unease and distress,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Jibes at foreigners have already cost Britain jobs, she said, pointing to two of her own clients who have just opted to set up new offices in the Netherlands and Germany respectively, as a direct result of visa restrictions there being unlikely to change.</p> <p>\u201cAll the qualified workers now prefer migrating to Canada, Australia and New Zealand,\u201d she said. \u201cThe feeling of our highly skilled clients is that while the UK needs our skills, we do not feel wanted.\u201d</p> <p>In 2013, when then prime minister David Cameron led a trade delegation to India, he gave a TV interview saying the UK would be \u201cincredibly welcoming\u201d to Indians who wanted to study in the UK. The interview was interpreted as Cameron suggesting conscientious, hardworking Indians were the right kind of immigrant for the UK.</p> <p>Rahul Chatterjee, who has now decided to apply to US universities for his postgraduate degree, said Britain needs highly skilled immigrant labour from India. \u201cIf I were a blue-collar worker, and I saw other people, foreigners, getting jobs, and I wasn\u2019t getting one, I\u2019d be pretty ticked off too. If that is the case. But obviously some people lack the kind of education to understand the economic benefits immigrants bring.</p> <p>\u201cThe US allows students to work anywhere in the country for one year after completing an undergrad degree. So you can see why many students prefer that. Politicians like Amber Rudd and Theresa May know economically that they need foreign guys to drive down prices, but the stuff they say is to appeal to public sentiment.\u201d</p> <p>Ashmita Lucktoo, editor of <em>NRI World</em>, a magazine for expat Indians, said people felt hurt by the rising anti-immigrant talk. \u201cThe UK used to be the golden bird of the world, they used to rule India, and now they\u2019re not on top any more, so there\u2019s an inferiority complex, especially with regard to brown skin,\u201d she said.</p> <p>\u201cEven if you have a degree or skills, you\u2019re forced into menial jobs like working at Burger King or Starbucks. Indians are now under enormous pressure to succeed; if you\u2019re going to the UK, either you have to succeed and make it really big, or you may as well come home and have some dignity.\u201d</p>",

  "<p>Not far from Mosul, a large military force is finalising plans for an advance that has been more than three decades in the making. The troops are Shia militiamen who have fought against the Islamic State, but they have not been given a direct role in the coming attack to free Iraq\u2019s second city from its clutches.</p> <p>Instead, while the Iraqi army attacks Mosul from the south, the militias will take up a blocking position to the west, stopping Isis forces from fleeing towards their last redoubt of Raqqa in Syria. Their absence is aimed at reassuring the Sunni Muslims of Mosul that the imminent recapture of the city is not a sectarian push against them. However, among Iraq\u2019s Shia-dominated army the militia\u2019s decision to remain aloof from the battle of Mosul is being seen as a rebuff.</p> <p>Yet among the militias\u2019 backers in Iran there is little concern. Since their inception, the Shia irregulars have made their name on the battlefields of Iraq, but they have always been central to Tehran\u2019s ambitions elsewhere. By not helping to retake Mosul, the militias are free to drive one of its most coveted projects \u2013 securing an arc of influence across Iraq and Syria that would end at the Mediterranean Sea.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2016/10/tehran-zip/giv-1406XsQMElhEOca5\" data-alt=\"Iran's arc of influence\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2016/10/tehran-zip/giv-1406XsQMElhEOca5\">Iran's arc of influence</a> </figure>  <p>The strip of land to the west of Mosul in which the militias will operate is essential to that goal. After 12 years of conflict in Iraq and an even more savage conflict in Syria, Iran is now closer than ever to securing a land corridor that will anchor it in the region \u2013 and potentially transform the Islamic Republic\u2019s presence on Arab lands. \u201cThey have been working extremely hard on this,\u201d said a European official who has monitored Iran\u2019s role in both wars for the past five years. \u201cThis is a matter of pride for them on one hand and pragmatism on the other. They will be able to move people and supplies between the Mediterranean and Tehran whenever they want, and they will do so along safe routes that are secured by their people, or their proxies.\u201d</p> <p>Interviews during the past four months with regional officials, influential Iraqis and residents of northern Syria have established that the land corridor has slowly taken shape since 2014. It is a complex route that weaves across Arab Iraq, through the Kurdish north, into Kurdish north-eastern Syria and through the battlefields north of Aleppo, where Iran and its allies are prevailing on the ground. It has been assembled under the noses of friend and foe, the latter of which has begun to sound the alarm in recent weeks. Turkey has been especially opposed, fearful of what such a development means for Iran\u2019s relationship with the PKK (the Kurdistan Workers\u2019 party), the restive Kurds in its midst, on whom much of the plan hinges.</p> <p>The plan has been coordinated by senior government and security officials in Tehran, Baghdad and Damascus, all of whom defer to the head of the spearhead of Iran\u2019s foreign policy, the Quds force of the Revolutionary Guards, headed by Major General Qassem Suleimani, who has run Iran\u2019s wars in Syria and Iraq. It involves demographic shifts, which have already taken place in central Iraq and are under way in northern Syria. And it relies heavily on the support of a range of allies, who are not necessarily aware of the entirety of the project but have a developed vested interest in securing separate legs.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e04c9b0d69d42544b5367b45b8fccac33853903c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e04c9b0d69d42544b5367b45b8fccac33853903c/0_96_4669_2802/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Maj Gen Qassem Suleimani\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Maj Gen Qassem Suleimani, head of Iran\u2019s all-powerful Quds force.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: HO/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The corridor starts at the entry points that Iran has used to send supplies and manpower into Iraq over the past 12 years. They are the same routes that were used by the Quds force to run a guerrilla war against US forces when they occupied the country \u2013 a campaign fought by the same Iraqi militias that have since been immersed in the fight against Isis.</p> <p>The groups, Asa\u2019ib ahl al-Haq, Keta\u2019ib Hezbollah and their offshoots, accounted for close to 25% of all US battlefield casualties, senior US officials have said. They have become even more influential since US forces left the country. And in one of modern warfare\u2019s starkest ironies, in the two years since US troops have returned to Iraq to fight Isis they have at times fought under US air cover.</p> <p>The route crosses through Baquba, the capital of Diyala province, around 60 miles north of Baghdad. A mixed Sunni/Shia area for hundreds of years, Diyala became one of the main sectarian flashpoint areas during Iraq\u2019s civil war. Along roads that have been secured by militias, which are known locally as \u201cpopular mobilisation units\u201d, it then moves northwest into areas that were occupied by Isis as recently as several months ago.</p> <p>The town of Shirqat in Salaheddin province is one important area. It was taken by militias along with Iraqi forces on 22 September, delivering another blow to the terrorist group and an important boost to Iran\u2019s ambitions.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/01/observer-view-russian-actions-syria-influence-international-law\">The Observer view on Russia\u2019s actions in Syria and the failure of international law | Observer editorial</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The militias are now present in large numbers in Shirqat and readying to move towards the western edge of Mosul, to a point around 50 miles southeast of Sinjar, which \u2013 at this point \u2013 is the next leg in the corridor. Between the militia forces and Sinjar is the town of Tal Afar, an Isis stronghold, which has been a historical home of both Sunni and Shia Turkmen \u2013 ancestral kin of Turkey.</p> <p>A senior intelligence official said the leg between Tel Afar and Sinjar is essential to the plan. Sinjar is an ancestral home to the Yazidi population, which was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/07/who-yazidi-isis-iraq-religion-ethnicity-mountains\">forced to flee in August 2014</a> after Isis invaded the city, killing all the men it could find and enslaving women.

And ever since PKK forces from across the Syrian border have taken up residence in the city and across the giant monolith, Mt Sinjar, behind it. The PKK fighters are being paid by the Iraqi government and have been incorporated into the popular mobilisation units. Iraqi and western intelligence officials say the move was approved by Iraq\u2019s national security adviser, Falah Fayadh.</p> <p>An influential Iraqi tribal sheikh, Abdulrahim al-Shammari, emerges as a central figure further to the north. He has a power base near the Rabia crossing into Syria, receives support from the popular mobilisation units and is close to the Assad regime in Damascus. \u201cI believe that in our area Iran does not have very much influence,\u201d he told the <em>Observer</em> in Baghdad. \u201cThere is nobody here, no major power that is helping us with weapons. Ideologically speaking, the PKK is affiliated with the Kurds of this area, so there is no problem having them here.\u201d</p> <p>From the Rabia crossing, the mooted route goes past the towns of Qamishli and Kobani towards Irfin, which are all controlled by the Syrian Kurdish YPG militia. Throughout the war the YPG (People\u2019s Protection Units) has hedged its bets, at times allying with the US against Isis, and at other times siding with the Syrian regime. \u201cIran thinks it has them where it wants them now,\u201d said the European source. \u201cI\u2019m not sure it has gauged the Turks correctly, though.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"52a1eea1fda30e13b01d3625055de2ff39d3b2c5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/52a1eea1fda30e13b01d3625055de2ff39d3b2c5/1472_95_2761_3452/800.jpg\" alt=\"A fighter in Sinjar\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A fighter sits on a balcony in Sinjar, Iraq after the town was retaken from Isis by Kurdish-led forces.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Cengiz Yar/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Of all the points between Tehran and the Syrian coast, Aleppo has concentrated Iran\u2019s energies more than anywhere else. Up to 6,000 militia members, mostly from Iraq, have congregated there ahead of a move to take the rebel-held east of the city, which could begin around the same time as the assault on Mosul.</p> <p>Those who have observed Suleimani up close as he inspects the frontlines in Syria and Iraq, or in meetings in Damascus and Baghdad, where he projects his immense power through studied calm, say he has invested everything in Syria \u2013 and in ensuring that Iran emerges from a brutal, expensive war with its ambitions enhanced. \u201cIf we lose Syria, we lose Tehran,\u201d Suleimani told the late Iraqi politician Ahmed Chalabi in 2014. Chalabi told the <em>Observer</em> at the time that Suleimani had added: \u201cWe will turn all this chaos into an opportunity.\u201d</p> <p>Securing Aleppo would be an important leg in the corridor, which would run past two villages to the north that have historically been in Shia hands. From there, a senior Syrian official, and Iraqi officials in Baghdad, said it would run towards the outskirts of Syria\u2019s fourth city, Homs, then move north through the Alawite heartland of Syria, which a year of Russian airpower has again made safe for Assad. Iran\u2019s hard-won road ends at the port of Latakia, which has remained firmly in regime hands throughout the war.</p> <p>Ali Khedery, who advised all US ambassadors to Iraq and four commanders of Centcom in 2003-11 said securing a Mediterranean link would be seen as a strategic triumph in Iran. \u201cIt signifies the consolidation of Iran\u2019s control over Iraq and the Levant, which in turn confirms their hegemonic regional ambitions,\u201d he said. \u201cThat should trouble every western leader and our regional allies because this will further embolden Iran to continue expanding, likely into the Gulf countries next, a goal they have explicitly and repeatedly articulated.

  "<p>To be a champion side requires many attributes \u2013 some of which Wigan have looked shorn of on occasions this year.

That is the thing about the new Super League champions: they just do not know when they are beaten.

Wigan were toiling under the bright lights, errors aplenty creeping into their play as the hour mark and a telling moment approached.</p> <p>Warrington looked as if they were finally about to punish Wigan and strike what would have been a telling blow when Ryan Atkins appeared to have scored, opening up a two-try lead and surely ending Warrington\u2019s winless run at Old Trafford. A knock-on from Atkins, however, saved Wigan and within a minute they were level. Soon after they were ahead.</p> <p>Wigan would not let a winning position slip when it mattered: just like so many times this season.</p> <p>Conversely, it is more Grand Final heartbreak for Warrington after another desperate defeat on the game\u2019s biggest stage. Of the three showpiece finals they have now lost here, this one will be the most frustrating. For large periods they appeared in control. They led at half-time on merit but could not find that decisive play to put Wigan away \u2013 and they were punished. The gamble on Chris Sandow, named on the bench for his first appearance since the Challenge Cup final, which Warrington also lost, backfired.</p> <p>Wigan\u2019s only points in the first half put them into an early 2-0 lead. After back-to-back penalties on the Warrington line, the Warriors opted for the measured approach via the boot of Matty Smith, but from there, it was Warrington who grew stronger as the half wore on.</p> <p>Wigan were the brighter side in the opening 15 minutes but when they had a try ruled out for a forward pass that allowed Josh Charnley to touch down it stunted their momentum.</p> <p>An error from the Warriors on their own line afforded Warrington a chance they would not squander. Declan Patton showed, dummied and darted over for the half\u2019s only try, the Warrington-born half-back converting for a 6-2 lead.</p> <p>The first 40 minutes was bruising, chaotic and, for the most part, breathless viewing. However, the nervous tension inside the stadium was palpable and it was transferring on to the pitch. Mistakes had plagued both sides on a night where conditions were perfect for fast, flowing play and as Wigan began to look increasingly sloppy they looked to have finally been put away.</p> <p>Atkins appeared to touch down in the left corner \u2013 so much so that the referee, Robert Hicks, sent the decision upstairs to the video referee as a try. But the discovery of a knock-on from the centre in the act of scoring meant the decision was overturned and it soon became clear how crucial that was.</p> <p>With 60 seconds Wigan sprung downfield and levelled. A wonderful break from Liam Farrell, awarded the Harry Sunderland Trophy as man of the match, pierced the Warrington defence and he had Oliver Gildart in support to score the 100th try in Grand Final history.</p> <p>With Smith\u2019s conversion going wide, it meant the game remained level at 6-6: but with momentum now on their side once again, it was not long before Wigan went ahead.</p> <p>Dan Sarginson and Charnley, their two departing heroes, had experienced indifferent nights up until now, but when the full-back kicked through for the Sale-bound winger to touch down \u2013 just \u2013 in the corner, it completed a remarkable turnaround.</p> <p>Smith would miss the conversion again, but with Warrington panicking and becoming increasingly desperate, he would not pass up the chance to extend the lead to six in the dying moments with another penalty.</p> <p>Warrington had their chances late on, but they could not break down the Wigan defence.

Admittedly it was only a smattering this time, rather than the mutinous soundtrack that accompanied Roy Hodgson\u2019s last match, but the mixed reaction at the final whistle was a pointed reminder that England will need more than a 2-0 victory against Malta before they have retrieved some credibility.</p> <p>Southgate should probably not take it too personally after being parachuted into the role on an emergency basis, but he could probably be forgiven for wishing that his team had been able to add a few more goals against a Malta side that looked ripe for a good old-fashioned thrashing.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/oct/08/england-malta-2-0-world-cup-qualifier-five-talking-points-waybe-rooney-jesse-lingard-roberto-mancini\">England 2-0 Malta: Five talking points from Wembley | Dominic Fifield</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Roberto Mancini was here as a guest and, though it would be a leap of logic to assume the former Manchester City manager is being primed for the job, he is currently out of work and has talked before about fancying a stab at managing England. Southgate needs his team to impress during his four matches as caretaker manager if he is to be offered the job full-time and, on that basis, he must be disappointed his team had to settle for the first-half goals from Daniel Sturridge and Dele Alli.</p> <p>To put it into context, Malta arrived at Wembley with the grand total of two wins in the last three years, those victories coming against the footballing superpowers of Lithuania and Faroe Islands. Malta\u2019s current position in Fifa\u2019s world rankings, 176th, puts them level with Laos, though just behind Suriname, Vanuatu, Cambodia and Tahiti, and is the lowest they have dropped since the system was devised almost a quarter of a century ago. Scotland have already beaten them 5-1 in this qualifying programme though, in fairness, England could have won even more convincingly had it not been for a splendid performance from Andrew Hogg, Malta\u2019s Surrey-born goalkeeper.</p> <p>England certainly had enough of the ball to reflect that it should have been a much more emphatic scoreline but, equally, the second half also featured a slightly awkward five-minute spell when the crowd started entertaining themselves, flashing up their mobile phones in the way that people used to wave cigarette lighters at Elton John concerts. An attendance not far off 82,000 is mightily impressive given everything England have endured since they were last here, shortly before Euro 2016, but the crowd undeniably wanted more to help the healing process.</p> <p>Southgate\u2019s men knew their own superiority and perhaps that explains why they plodded through long spells while also giving the impression that if they could be bothered to take the occasion a little more seriously they might have scored a hatful. They kept the crowd waiting almost half an hour before Sturridge\u2019s precise header gave them the lead. Alli\u2019s goal came nine minutes later and from that point onwards it was an exercise in damage-limitation for Malta. In truth, it probably always was.</p> <p>When the opposition are this limited, it is certainly difficult to form any lasting conclusions about Wayne Rooney\u2019s capabilities as a midfielder. Jesse Lingard, winning his first cap, should be aware it is not always this easy and Joe Hart must wonder if he will ever have a more straightforward assignment.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/oct/08/england-manager-gareth-southgate-malta-wembley\">England\u2019s not-quite manager Gareth Southgate survives bland audition | Barney Ronay</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Malta managed one shot throughout the entire game and Hart duly ticked off the 36th clean sheet of his international career, moving ahead of Gordon Banks into third in the all-time list of England shut-outs \u2013 four behind David Seaman and 30 adrift of Peter Shilton. Hart spent so long as a spectator he ran 40 yards to check on Ryan Bertrand after the hamstring injury that restricted England\u2019s left-back to only 19 minutes.</p> <p>A better time to judge Southgate\u2019s impact will come after the game in Slovenia on Tuesday, followed by the double-header against Scotland and Spain next month, but what is clear is that he concurs with Sam Allardyce and Hodgson \u2013 though evidently not Jos\u00e9 Mourinho \u2013 that Rooney\u2019s best position is now in a deep-lying role where he can dictate play and decorate games with showy passes to the wide positions.</p> <p>Alli took up the classic No10 role, albeit that being Rooney\u2019s shirt number, with Theo Walcott and Lingard operating on the wings in a 4-2-3-1 system. There was not, however, a great deal of width or penetration. Lingard did reasonably well but it was understandable if the crowd craved Marcus Rashford\u2019s sense of adventure. Rashford replaced Walcott midway through the second half but England continued to play the game at three-quarter pace and Hogg had strong credentials to be recognised as the game\u2019s outstanding performer. Malta\u2019s goalkeeper was a little slow, perhaps, when Sturridge headed in Jordan Henderson\u2019s cross for the first goal but he spared his team on at least half-a-dozen occasions.</p> <p>Henderson was also involved in England\u2019s second goal, breaking through midfield before Alli whipped in a right-footed shot from just inside the penalty area. Hogg saved the first effort but Alli darted forward to stab in the rebound, showing much more determination then the nearest defender, Andrei Agius, to get to the ball first.</p> <p>From that stage, England might have been expected to have a lot more fun at Malta\u2019s expense. Instead, they huffed and puffed to the end, making a comfortable win also feel like a slightly unsatisfactory one, and featuring audible boos for Rooney after one moment of carelessness.</p>",

But it could be the start of a lengthy reign for Gareth Southgate, or it could be simply the first bullet-point in a footballing footnote, as the former Middlesbrough manager joins Howard Wilkinson, Peter Taylor and Stuart Pearce in stopgap corner.</p> <p>Today probably won\u2019t tell us all that much. You know the drill by now. Look back at England\u2019s recent qualifiers against Europe\u2019s minnows at home and you see a fairly clear pattern. There was the the 5-0 win over San Marino in October 2012, the 4-0 win over Moldova in September 2013, the 5-0 win over San Marino in October 2014 and the 4-0 win over Lithuania in March 2015. You can even throw in the 2-0 win over Estonia in October 2015 if you like.</p> <p>It\u2019ll be, history tells us, a generally uninspiring win. But how could it really be anything else? It\u2019s nigh on impossible to look exciting or in any way vivacious in these games but very easy to look a bit uninspired and generally sluggish. So Big Sam\u2019s swift arrival-and-departure has at least added a twang of interest in what would otherwise be routine qualifier-trudge. Scotland\u2019s 5-1 win in Malta last month is probably the benchmark for Southgate\u2019s side.</p> <p>The selection subplots?

  "<p>The shock is that people are shocked. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/08/donald-trump-forced-into-apology-as-sex-boast-tape-horrifies-republicans\">Donald Trump thinks he is entitled to grope women</a>, grab their crotches, to describe sexual assault as some kind of banter. Trump wears his misogyny as proudly as his hair. Feel it, he says, go on see if it\u2019s real. It\u2019s real enough. He is telling it like it is, this is how men are with women. There is no difference between truth and lies. There is only power and its constant neurotic need to reassert itself.</p> <p>His campaign is an anxiety performance. Machismo by its nature is always an exaggeration, an overcompensation. It works for losers precisely because it covers loss. Look, he says to the disempowered, white male, look at me and my phallic boasting. I will make you hard again.</p> <p>His hatred of women, his refusal of their bodily autonomy, whether over sex or reproductive rights, is not suddenly being revealed. This is his lifestyle. Now he has crossed a line apparently. Well, the line is a moveable feast when you can hint at assassinating your opponent, at the black vote being rigged, at interviewers menstruating. Multiple choice offence is his USP. Suck it up, bitches.</p> <p>And they do. Most senior Republicans have not withdrawn their endorsements. They just feel a bit queasy. Mostly because they have wives and daughters and stuff. Potential gropees. Poor men having their property tampered with. What a violation, but it\u2019s not the worst. You think I am joking? I have been to Republican rallies where the stickers read: \u201cMy wife yes, my dog maybe, my gun never.\u201d</p> <p>Hilarious!</p> <p>Now some of these guys think Trump has made unacceptable remarks. They must just mean \u201crecorded\u201d, as if saying <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/27/alicia-machado-miss-universe-weight-shame-trump-speaks-out-clinton\">women are pigs</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jul/02/donald-trump-racist-claims-mexico-rapes\">Mexicans are rapists</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/04/us-military-veterans-donald-trump-petition-john-mccain\">war vets are sissies</a> is just tickety-boo. They must sense and fear that Trump\u2019s strength depends on defining what is weak and negating it. Nothing then is off limits.</p> <p>The good guys are also out in force, telling us they don\u2019t speak about women like this and have never heard anything like it. They are forever respectful. Well respectfully, they should shut up and listen. I have heard men speak like this all my life. The idea that men are suddenly discovering misogyny because of Trump is somewhat strange. Where have they been?</p> <p>Trump is hardly the first entitled politico. Silvio Berlusconi and Dominque Strauss-Kahn bought the bodies of young women. Everyone at the IMF knew no woman could be alone with Strauss-Kahn. Westminster has its share of gropers and grabbers who know not what they do because they are \u201cdepressed\u201d. Men let other men off the hook or, when confronted, say they didn\u2019t realise the full extent of what was happening.</p> <p>So I would rather hear from women and they are all over Twitter telling of the first time they were sexually assaulted, some at eight, 11, 13. A brother\u2019s friend. A neighbour. A man on a bus.</p> <p>The first time is when you realise that your body is up for grabs, that the sexual pleasure taken from it does not belong to you. Sex is something that is done to you, not done by you. And if it hurts, just grow to like the pain. This is the culture I grew up in, it\u2019s the culture my daughters grow up in.</p> <p>This absolute refusal to say misogyny involves all men because it is a system by which the abuse of women acts as a guarantor of masculinity is part of the problem. Women have to modify their behaviour. Walk home that way, don\u2019t wear that, don\u2019t answer back, don\u2019t drink too much, don\u2019t post that selfie, smile before you run for your life. Believe it\u2019s not all men or your life would not be worth living.</p> <p>When one man speaks up applaud him. Here is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/13/robert-de-niro-donald-trump-is-totally-nuts\">Robert De Niro</a> who can\u2019t take it any more. But where are the other guys who have had this tape for a while? Why, as it features Billy Bush, did they not put it out when Jeb Bush was being hammered in the primaries? Why did we need a tape to find Trump abhorrent?</p> <p>Of course some women will continue to collude with these scumbags, they will vote for Trump, they will excuse him. Women are good at excusing men. If we weren\u2019t, the human race would die out. Some women will look away, believing men can\u2019t help it and carry on humouring the \u201cbanter\u201d. You drop something in a restaurant and a guy says: \u201cWhile you are down there love\u2026\u201d and you laugh because if you didn\u2019t you might stick a fork in his eye. And you remember being 14 and being bruised from mere \u201cgroping\u201d but thinking yourself lucky because the worst didn\u2019t happen. You think about how you knew the practice of misogyny long before you heard the theory, so wonder how the good guys are slightly baffled by it.</p> <p>But now with Trump, there is evidence. On a tape. Had they not heard the stories women tell? Yes, America could still elect the man <a href=\"http://blogs.bookforum.com/review/2015/08/05/will-the-real-american-psycho-please-stand-up-why-donald-trump-was-patrick-batemans-hero/\">idolised</a> by Patrick Bateman in <em>American Psycho</em>. For misogyny is not some secret society, a form of freemasonry. It is mainstream. It is endorsed by Trump. It is not simply unacceptable, it is murderous.</p> <p>Kill it dead.</p>",
  "<p>Donald Trump is offering himself as president of a country whose federal income taxes he gives every appearance of dodging. He says he is fit to be commander in chief, after avoiding giving a cent more than he could towards the wages of the troops who must fight for him. He <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2016/07/full-transcript-donald-trump-nomination-acceptance-speech-at-rnc-225974#ixzz4MOJB7oDa\">laments</a> an America where \u201cour roads and bridges are falling apart, our airports are in third world condition and 43 million Americans are on food stamps\u201d, while striving tirelessly to avoid paying for one pothole to be mended or mouth to be filled.</p> <p>Men\u2019s lies reveal more about them than their truths. For years, Trump promoted the bald, racist lie that Barack Obama was born in Kenya and, as an unAmerican, was disqualified from holding the presidency. We should have guessed then. We should have known that Trump\u2019s subconscious was trying to hide the fact that he was barely an American citizen at all.</p> <p>He would not contribute to his country or play his part in its collective endeavours. Like a guest in a hotel who runs off leaving the bill, Trump wanted to enjoy the room service without paying for the room. You should never lose your capacity to be shocked, especially in 2016 when the shocking has become commonplace. The <em>New York Times</em> published a joint <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/07/opinion/the-white-house-rule-no-tax-returns-no-job.html\">piece</a> last week by former White House ethics advisers \u2013 one to George W Bush and one to Barack Obama, so no one could accuse the paper of bias. They were stunned.</p> <p>No president would have nominated Trump for public office, they said. If one had, \u201cexplaining to the senate and to the American people how a billionaire could have a $916m \u2018loss carry-forward\u2019 that potentially allowed him to not pay taxes for perhaps as long as 18 years would have been far too difficult for the White House when many hard-working Americans turn a third or more of their earnings over to the government\u201d.</p> <p>Trump\u2019s bragging about the humiliations he inflicts on women is shocking. Trump\u2019s oxymoronic excuses about his \u201cfiduciary duty\u201d to his businesses to pay as little personal tax as he could are shocking. (No businessman has a corporate \u201cfiduciary duty\u201d to enrich himself rather than his company.) Never let familiarity dilute your contempt.</p> <p>And yet looked at from another angle, Trump is not so shocking. You may be reading this piece online after clicking on a Facebook link. If you are in Britain, the profits from the adverts Facebook hits you with will be logged in Ireland, which required <a href=\"http://www.irishexaminer.com/business/facebook-ireland-pays-34m-corporatetax-on-48bn-of-sales-370278.html\">Facebook to pay a mere \u20ac3.4m in corporate taxes last year on revenues of \u20ac4.83bn</a> . If you are reading on an Apple device, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/sep/01/apple-boss-tim-cook-repatriate-billions-to-us-treasury-next-year\">Apple has booked $214.9bn offshore to avoid $65.4bn in US taxes</a>. They are hardly alone. One recent American <a href=\"http://ctj.org/pdf/offshoreshellgames2016.pdf.\">study</a> found that 367 of the Fortune 500 operate one or more subsidiaries in tax havens.</p> <p>Trump may seem a grotesque and alien figure, but his values are all around you. The Pepsi in your hand, the iPhone in your pocket, the Google search engine you load and the Nike trainers you put on your feet come from a tax-exempt economy, which expects you to pick up the bills.</p> <p>The short answer to Conservatives who say \u201ctheir behaviour is legal\u201d is that it is a scandal that it is legal. The long answer is to invite them to look at the state of societies where Trumpian economics have taken hold. If they live in Britain or America, they should not have to look far.</p> <p>The story liberal capitalism tells itself is heroic. Bloated incumbent businesses are overthrown by daring entrepreneurs. They outwit the complacent and blundering old firms and throw them from their pinnacles. They let creative destruction rip through the economy and bring new products and jobs with it.</p> <p>If that justification for free-market capitalism was ever true, it is not true now. The free market in tax, it turns out, allows firms to move offshore and leave stagnant economies behind. Giant companies are no longer threatened by buccaneering entrepreneurs and innovative small businesses. Indeed, they don\u2019t appear to be threatened by anyone.</p> <p>The share of nominal GDP generated by the Fortune 100 biggest American companies rose from 33% of GDP in 1994 to 46% in 2013, the <em>Economis</em>t <a href=\"http://www.economist.com/news/special-report/21707048-small-group-giant-companiessome-old-some-neware-once-again-dominating-global\">reported</a>. Despite all the fuss about tech entrepreneurship, the number of startups is lower than at any time since the late 1970s. More US companies now die than are born.</p> <p>For how can small firms, which have to pay tax, challenge established giants that move their money offshore? They don\u2019t have lobbyists. They can\u2019t use a small part of their untaxed profits to make the campaign donations <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/dec/18/google-political-donations-congress\">Google and the other monopolistic firms </a>give to keep the politicians onside.</p> <p>John Lewis has asked our government repeatedly how it can be fair to charge the partnership tax while allowing its rival <a href=\"http://www.itv.com/news/2016-01-06/john-lewis-concerned-amazon-tax-problem-is-creating-an-unfair-fight/\">Amazon</a> to run its business through Luxembourg. A more pertinent question is why any government desperate for revenue would want a system that gave tax dodgers a competitive advantage.</p> <p>What applies to businesses applies to individuals. The tax take depends as much on national culture as the threat of punishment, on what economists call \u201ctax morale\u201d.</p> <p>No one likes paying taxes, but in northern European and North American countries most thought that they should pay them. Maybe I have lived a sheltered life, but I have no more heard friends discuss how they cheat the taxman than I have heard them discuss how they masturbate. If they cheat, they keep their dirty secrets to themselves. Let tax morale collapse, let belief in the integrity of the system waver, however, and states become like Greece, where everyone who can evade tax does.</p> <p>The surest way to destroy morale is to make the people who pay taxes believe that the government is taking them for fools by penalising them while sparing the wealthy.</p> <p>Theresa May <a href=\"https://www.moneymarketing.co.uk/may-coming-tax-advisers/\">promised</a> at the Conservative party conference that \u201chowever rich or powerful \u2013 you have a duty to pay your tax\u201d.</p> <p>I would have been more inclined to believe her if she had promised, at this moment of asserting sovereignty, to close the British sovereign tax havens of the Channel Islands, Isle of Man, Bermuda and the British Virgin and Cayman Islands.</p> <p>But let us give the new PM time to prove herself. If she falters, she should consider this. Revenue &amp; Customs can only check 4% of self-assessment tax returns. If the remaining 96% decide that if Trump and his kind can cheat, they can cheat too, she would not be able to stop them.</p>",

LPJ attempts to highlight the often forgotten work of the states \u2013 whether related to shutting down abortion clinics, restrictive voter ID laws or restricting bathroom access to trans people.</p> <p>\u201cMost important legislation is coming out of the states and it\u2019s happening because people don\u2019t know how all this anti-choice legislation is drafted,\u201d said Winstead.</p> <p>State politicians who make these laws \u2013 usually white, cisgender men \u2013 often run in elections with low voter turnout and little public interest, allowing them to slip under the radar. \u201cIt\u2019s not people driven by science, facts, constitutional law or even working knowledge of anatomy that are elected,\u201d noted Winstead.</p> <p>\u201cWomen\u2019s healthcare is compromised in order for Republican officeholders to promote their own agenda,\u201d said Davis, who founded the political organization Deeds Not Words. She noted that the Texas maternal death rate has doubled in the last five years and that women are self-inducing abortions in higher numbers. </p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a whirlwind of misogyny. We see it on full display in this election, but those of us who have been fighting on behalf of gender equality for this country have been seeing it every day on both local, state and national levels,\u201d Davis said.</p> <p>At the Golden Probes, Indiana\u2019s governor, Mike Pence, might have narrowly missed out on the \u201coutstanding underperformance by a politician in a leading role\u201d award (that went to Kentucky Governor Matt Bevin, for claiming that the blood of innocents will need to be spilled if Hillary Clinton is elected president), but several high-profile guests said they\u2019d award their own Golden Probe to Pence\u2019s presidential running mate, Donald Trump.</p> <p>\u201cHe doesn\u2019t say real things.

Martin worked for the same NSA contractor, Booz Allen Hamilton, that employed the whistleblower <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/edward-snowden\">Edward Snowden</a>, but his own motive remains a mystery.</p> <p>Elizabeth Martin, a former police officer who now lives in Australia, told the New York Times in a phone interview: \u201cHe was one of the most patriotic people I knew.</p> <p>\u201cHe brought work home all the time \u2013 he was always on a laptop, always working, always studying,\u201d she said, adding that he had stacks of books and papers everywhere and was \u201ca bit of a hoarder\u201d.</p> <p>Her husband had no interest in politics and was interested mainly in computers, Martin told the paper, describing him as \u201ca genuinely nice guy \u2013 a little eccentric, but not in a bad way\u201d.</p> <p>NSA officials believe Martin had been taking home \u201ca staggering quantity\u201d of highly classified material in various formats since the 1990s, according to the Times report, but have been unable to link him directly to half a dozen leaks that have appeared on the internet over the past three years. Investigators are said to be studying whether his home computers might have been hacked.</p> <p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/JesselynRadack?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\">Jesselyn Radack</a>, a lawyer who represents whistleblowers, responded to the report on Twitter: \u201cSounds like the latest \u2018NSA leaker\u2019 is really a kleptomaniac with a hoarding disorder.\u201d</p> <p>Martin is known to have enlisted in the US navy in 1987 and left the service in 2000. Roy Rada, a retired professor at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County, who mentored him during his early PhD research, told the Times Martin believed he had many of the symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder, possibly a result of his service in Operation Desert Storm in Iraq.</p> <p>Martin is enrolled in the university\u2019s information systems graduate programme. The university partners with the NSA to provide opportunities for jobs, training and scholarship support.</p> <p>His arrest was not made public until Wednesday, when the justice department unsealed a criminal complaint that accused Martin of having been in possession of top secret information that could cause \u201cexceptionally grave danger\u201d to national security.</p> <p>According to an FBI affidavit accompanying the complaint: \u201cMartin at first denied, and later when confronted with specific documents, admitted he took documents and digital files from his work assignment to his residence and vehicle that he knew were classified. Martin stated that he knew what he had done was wrong and that he should not have done it because he knew it was unauthorised.\u201d <br></p> <p>The complaint does not specify which documents Martin is alleged to have taken or when he did so. He was arrested about the same time US officials acknowledged an investigation into a cyber leak of purported hacking tools used by the NSA to tamper with firewalls.</p> <p>Martin appeared in court on 29 August and remains in custody. If convicted, he would face a maximum of 11 years in prison. </p> <p>His lawyers, Jim Wyda and Deborah Boardman, said: \u201cThere is no evidence that Hal Martin intended to betray his country. What we do know is that Hal Martin loves his family and his country. He served honorably in the United States navy as a lieutenant and he has devoted his entire career to protecting his country. We look forward to defending Hal Martin in court.\u201d</p> <p>It is the second such high-profile case in three years, raising fresh questions about internal security at the NSA, particularly its ability to guard against an insider threat.</p> <p>Rajesh De, general counsel for the NSA when Snowden went public in the Guardian in June 2013, revealing the NSA\u2019s bulk collection of millions of Americans\u2019 phone records, told the Associated Press: \u201cOne key thing we don\u2019t have visibility into now is how he was caught, because that would provide some insight into whether the reforms that were put in post-Snowden were effective or not, or their relative efficacy.\u201d<br></p> <p>De added that it was unlikely \u201cyou\u2019re going to be able to stop every incident of somebody taking documents if they\u2019re determined to do so. But the real question is how quickly can you detect it, how quickly can you mitigate the harm of any such incident.\u201d</p> <p>The White House spokesman, Josh Earnest, said the government had reduced the number of people who need security clearances by 17% and enhanced the quality of background checks. A national insider threat taskforce has established government-wide minimum reforms to prevent the theft or unauthorised disclosure of sensitive information. </p> <p>\u201cSo this is certainly something that the administration takes seriously, and there are important lessons that we have learned since the case of Mr Snowden,\u201d Earnest told reporters. </p> <p>\u201cBut I think that this risk is always going to be there as long as there is a desire to share sensitive information across the government. And we know that there is a risk of not sharing that information.\u201d<br></p> <p>Adam Schiff of California, the senior Democrat on the House select committee on intelligence, said: \u201cI applaud the FBI for making an arrest, but it is painfully clear that the intelligence community still has much to do to institutionalise reforms designed to protect in advance the nation\u2019s sources and methods from insider threats.\u201d</p> <p>Defenders of Snowden have argued that he leaked top secret <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/19/washington-post-wrong-edward-snowden-pardon\">documents to journalists on principle</a>, believing the NSA was acting unconstitutionally by engaging in mass surveillance.

  "<p>Business groups are braced for a hard Brexit after an uncompromising Conservative party conference that championed taking control of immigration above the need to stay inside the European Union\u2019s single market and secure tariff-free trade.</p> <p>The markets have reacted by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/04/uk-stock-markets-soar-as-sterling-slumps-to-record-low\" title=\"\">sending the pound plunging to levels not seen since the 1980s</a>. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/07/uk-must-pay-price-for-brexit-says-francois-hollande\" title=\"\">French president Fran\u00e7ois Hollande made it clear last week</a> that his reading of the Birmingham conference was the same. \u201cThe UK has decided to do a Brexit, I believe even a hard Brexit,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Yet while the momentum is towards a full-blown exit, contradictory noises are coming from chancellor Philip Hammond and business secretary Greg Clark, who favour Britain retaining its place inside the single market.</p> <p>Business leaders are increasingly frustrated at the lack of a coherent plan: is it even possible, they ask, for the UK to extract concessions over access to European markets while also taking back control of immigration?</p> <h2><strong>The game plan, version 1</strong></h2> <p>Banks want to stay inside the single market and retain the EU \u201cpassporting rights\u201d that allow them to send vast sums of money across borders. This attaches the equivalent of an EU passport to all transactions, allowing them to take the fast lane through the banking system without any extra checks.</p> <p>Maintaining these rights would require a special deal for the financial services sector. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/06/hammond-acts-to-reassure-city-and-wall-street-on-brexit\" title=\"\">Last week the chancellor jetted to New York to reassure US bankers</a> that their businesses in London \u2013 and the 25,000 people they employ \u2013 were safe.</p> <p>Other sectors, from pharmaceuticals to agriculture, will also be looking for special deals and this could be problematic. Warwick University professor Nigel Driffield says: \u201cIf they all win concessions, we won\u2019t really be leaving the single market.\u201d</p> <p>International trade secretary Liam Fox, foreign secretary Boris Johnson and Brexit minister David Davis are readying themselves for a long game of poker. Each is convinced they have a strong hand.</p> <p>Davis has recruited civil servants from across Whitehall and handed them large files of documents relating to around 50 sectors. He convened meetings with business leaders soon after the 23 June vote to leave the EU to discuss their concerns about Brexit. But these talks served only to highlight the mammoth nature of the task ahead, as, sector by sector, they forecast the potential impact of leaving the single market \u2013 not just increased tariffs, but extra bureaucracy, too.</p> <p>At this stage, the government hinted at a delay in triggering article 50 \u2013 which will kickstart Brexit talks \u2013 possibly of more than a year, to allow time to formulate a negotiating strategy. Then it became clear that all the information-gathering was going to take too long and there was a change of heart. The prime minister told the Tory conference that article 50 would be triggered by the end of March at the latest. Officials agreed that negotiations would need to be an iterative process, with civil servants learning as they go.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0a7df4320c53b6cd35d3f5c41bbecf951c1c4191\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0a7df4320c53b6cd35d3f5c41bbecf951c1c4191/0_376_5644_3387/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Liam Fox wants to walk away from the European single market altogether.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Liam Fox wants to walk away from the European single market altogether.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>The game plan, version 2</strong></h2> <p>Fox has put together a parallel team to Davis\u2019s that insiders say assumes negotiations with the EU about staying in the single market will end in failure. He favours walking away from the single market and embracing the World Trade Organisation. Currently, Britain\u2019s relationship with the WTO is based on its membership of the EU. Operating solo will mean agreeing new tariffs, in particular for agriculture and most manufactured goods. (The WTO has struggled to agree terms for services.)</p> <p>Fox, who recently <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/09/fat-and-lazy-britain-is-ill-prepared-to-secure-future-outside-eu-says-fox\" title=\"\">accused British business leaders of being fat and lazy</a>, is expected to favour cutting tariffs to zero, whatever the EU decides. This free-market option, which has the approval of many Brexit-supporting economists, would end tariffs on things like South African beef and Australian wine, boosting disposable incomes in the UK. The tariff on beef from non-EU countries is a hefty 12.8%, plus between \u20ac1,414 and \u20ac3,041 per tonne. The tariff on wine from outside the EU is 30%. How Fox will secure reciprocal deals across the world to protect or boost UK exports is not known.</p> <h2><strong>Single market versus the customs union</strong></h2> <p>Some pro-Brexit campaigners are confident the Brussels elite will wake up to the damage that playing hardball over access to the single market will cause to their own industries.</p> <p>The car industry is often cited as the key to unlocking EU resistance. German carmakers and their workers are hardly likely to support Angela Merkel if the German premier\u2019s bargaining tactics result in Audi and BMW cars costing UK consumers more than they do now.</p> <p>The German view is important, but maybe not as important as the stance taken by Slovakia. This country of 5.4&#xa0;million people is busy building a sleek, modern car industry and doing very well. It is now the largest per capita producer of cars in the world and looking to extend its lead.</p> <p>It sells few cars in the UK, so high tariff barriers would not lead to a significant loss of trade. But Slovakia could only benefit should the extra costs faced by UK exporters encourage the likes of Nissan to shift production from Sunderland.</p> <p>It is easily forgotten that a Brexit agreement must be signed by the remaining 27 EU members states and in most cases ratified by domestic parliaments. This was underlined in Hollande\u2019s speech last week when he said that the EU, to save itself from breaking apart, must block any move towards concessions for the UK without free movement of labour.</p> <p>As an alternative to being in the single market \u2013 or joining Norway in the European Free Trade Area (Efta), which also involves free movement of labour \u2013 the UK could opt for the same status as Turkey and remain a member of the EU customs union. Turkey was rewarded with access to the EU 28, and through that a separate deal with Efta, after it said full membership of the EU was its goal. That may rule Britain out from the start.</p> <p>But membership of the customs union achieves only a one-dimensional relationship, with agreed tariffs that are possibly lower than those for outsider countries. There is still a hefty amount of bureaucracy, and it doesn\u2019t cover the services sector. Given that the UK has a \u00a316bn surplus with the EU in financial services and a \u00a33bn surplus in business services, maintaining these links will be crucial.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4196376d3503a3bf98abd3745a1b35b6bc62a2ae\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4196376d3503a3bf98abd3745a1b35b6bc62a2ae/0_178_4000_2401/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Nissan has asked the UK government to offer compensation for any new tariffs it might have to face.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Nissan has asked the UK government to offer compensation for any new tariffs it might have to face.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bloomberg</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>Compensation payments for tariffs</strong></h2> <p>The EU imposes tariffs on imports from outside the single market. Chinese steel is subject to a 22% tariff while Russian steel costs 36.1% more. Steel from Port Talbot destined for the EU could face a similar surcharge, which would price it out of vital markets. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/sep/30/nissan-hard-brexit-compensation-new-uk-investment-tariffs\" title=\"\">Nissan has asked for the government to offer compensation for tariffs</a>, whatever they turn out to be.</p> <p>So far ministers have argued that the fall in the pound is compensation enough. But with import prices soaring, the gains for carmakers, which buy 50% of the components in an assembled car from abroad, are limited.</p> <h2><strong>Transitional arrangements</strong></h2> <p>If compensation is ruled out, businesses are keen for ministers to declare that the impact of whatever is agreed will be delayed by a transitional arrangement. This would mean that any deal that, for argument\u2019s sake, leads to a full exit from the single market, is delayed for a transitional period of five of 10 years.</p> <p>Even a deal that offers major British exporters access to the single market will come at a cost, which business leaders say will require a long period of adjustment.</p> <p>And it is the costs in lost business and higher bills for controlling immigration that business leaders want politicians to understand. They complain that the rivalry inside Whitehall means there is no mechanism at the moment to judge the pros and cons of a hard Brexit because the information is sketchy at best.</p> <p>Some businesses complain that they have sat through five or six meetings since July with no idea where the government is going and little feedback. Without some clear guidance by Christmas, investment decisions that have been waiting for a green light since the beginning of the year could be scrapped. The risk is that the much-predicted post-Brexit vote recession is only delayed until 2017.</p>",

Having been out for 14 months after surgery, he will play competitively for the first time since he finished tied for 10th at the Wyndham Championship in 2015 \u2013 his best result of the season \u2013 in the Safeway Open in California (Sky Sports 4, 10pm). The US PGA tour event at Napa is the first of the season and Woods, who made only 11 starts in 2014-15 will be the major draw \u2013 he has 79 tour titles, second only to Sam Snead\u2019s 82. Patrick Reid was the star at Hazeltine but no one puts bums on seats like Tiger.</p> <h2>SHARAPOVA BACK IN PLAY</h2> <p>Maria Sharapova also makes a comeback but one that is likely to illicit less sympathy if not similar interest to Tiger\u2019s.

She plays on Monday, however, in the World Team Tennis competition Smash Hits event in Las Vegas, a charity tournament not covered by ITF regulations. The event splits the players into two teams captained by Billie Jean King and Elton John and proceeds go to the Elton John Aids Foundation. She will play alongside John McEnroe, Andy Roddick, Martina Navratilova, Mardy Fish, Mark Philippoussis and Liezel Huber.</p> <h2>ARMISTEAD IN THE SADDLE</h2> <p>After a difficult summer, when missing drug tests led to a ban before the Olympics, subsequently overturned but then only a fifth place at The Games, Lizzie Armistead has the opportunity to put it behind her at the UCI Road World Championships in Doha, where she could become the first British woman to defend a road race title, having taken it with great ride last year. Mark Cavendish attempts to win for the second at the same event, after victory in 2011 and the course should suit the sprinter (women\u2019s race, Tuesday, 11.05am, mens race: Wednesday, 11.35am, Eurosport).</p> <h2>HOY AT LE MANS</h2> <p>Already proven as a great champion on two wheels, Sir Chris Hoy\u2019s attempt to succeed on four is captured to fascinating effect in<em> Sir Chris Hoy: 200mph at Le Mans</em> (Sunday, BBC2, 9pm).

The interview took place before he announced his retirement on Twitter and then promptly withdrew the statement. He had already pulled out of his rematch with Wladimir Klitschko, having taken the Ukrainian\u2019s title on points last November. If his licence is removed he will be unable to defend his WBO and WBA titles but the interview suggested he was not in a fit state to do so. \u201cI\u2019ve not been in a gym for months,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve not been training.

A street-style star with a distinctive look \u2013 a tattooed bad boy \u2013 and a huge Instagram following, his appointment was based on the assumption that his popularity would translate into sales. The O\u2019Shea-ification of Brioni began when he restyled its flagship shop in Paris into a temple of minimalist chic and changed the label\u2019s font.</p> <p>At Brioni\u2019s Paris couture week presentation, O\u2019Shea went further down his aesthetic rabbit hole. Unlike other fashion houses that nodded to \u201cathleisure\u201d and the hippy movement, O\u2019Shea upped the peacock factor. The collection featured crocodile-skin jackets, chinchilla fur snoods and a calf-length jacket covered in a gun print, as well as O\u2019Shea\u2019s interpretation of the classic Brioni suit. These were slim fitting, nipped in the waist, in white, velvet and pinstripes, suggesting his muse was a high-end criminal, coolly exiting a bank he had just robbed.</p> <p>Some have suggested that O\u2019Shea\u2019s exit from the company is part of an elegy for menswear as we know it. With the collections of Burberry, Balmain, Gucci and Bottega Veneta mixed into the women\u2019s collections, there is a suspicion in some circles that the dedicated men\u2019s fashion week could become a thing of the past. \u201cIt\u2019s been fascinating to see so many of the heritage tailoring brands grappling with how to offer what modern men want to wear, with varying degrees of success,\u201d says Nowill.</p> <p>Brioni will continue, pointedly showing its autumn/winter collection for buyers in its Milan showroom rather than the catwalk. As for O\u2019Shea, he posted a picture of a Brioni-branded coffin on Instagram a day before the news was announced. A prophetic vision for the future of menswear and the suit? We\u2019ll have to wait and see.</p>",

After all, his video apology for the \u201cgroping\u201d tape included the following not-very-apologetic words: \u201cBill Clinton has actually abused women and Hillary has bullied, attacked, shamed and intimidated his victims. We will discuss this more in the coming days. See you at the debate on Sunday.\u201d</p> <p>This is, remember, the candidate who began one primary debate with a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/mar/04/trump-defends-his-manhood-after-rubios-small-hands-comment-video\">reference to the size of his genitalia</a>.

No surprise that the Republican National Committee should declare their man victorious in the vice-presidential debate this week. What did raise eyebrows, however, was the timing: the article was put online a couple of hours before the contest had even begun. </p> <p>Such premature publication is the nightmare of every newspaper obituarist. Twitter erupted and the RNC hastily took the article down, but there was no sign of an apology stating that Pence\u2019s triumph had been greatly exaggerated.</p> <p>As it happens, most watchers did declare Pence the winner once the debate had actually happened. But there was little to suggest that anyone cared.

About 37.2 million people tuned in to the nine television channels that carried it live, according to Nielsen, making this the least-watched VP duel since Dick Cheney v Joe Lieberman in 2000. The first Clinton-Trump debate got around 84 million.</p> <p>But Tuesday night\u2019s TV audience did include Walter Mondale, vice-president under Jimmy Carter. He took part in a live interaction with the New York Times website, headlined <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/05/us/politics/walter-mondale-reaction.html\">\u201cMessaging With Mondale: Real-Time Reactions From an Ex-Vice President\u201d</a>.

As a result of the wager, placed by a 46-year-old woman, William Hill has shortened Clinton\u2019s odds to 1/3 (75% chance) and lengthened Donald Trump\u2019s from 9/4 to 5/2.</p> <h2>\u2022\u2022\u2022</h2> <h2>Gaffe</h2> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>You\u2019ve whipped out that Mexican thing again.</p> </blockquote> <p> \u2013 Mike Pence finally takes the bait during the vice-presidential debate<br></p> <h2>\u2022\u2022\u2022</h2> <h2>Zinger</h2> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>See, I told you his hair wasn\u2019t orange!</p> </blockquote> <p> \u2013 Children in Las Vegas <a href=\"http://bit.ly/2dx5Je5\">react to Trump during his visit</a> to their school<br></p> <h2>\u2022\u2022\u2022</h2> <h2>Tweet</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/Rosie/status/783848742759829510\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/IvankaTrump\">@IvankaTrump</a> in a city of 8 million - we meet face 2 face - i thank u 4 listening - mother 2 mother - on this new years week -  my best 2 u</p>&mdash; Rosie (@Rosie) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Rosie/status/783848742759829510\">October 6, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p></p> <p>Rosie O\u2019Donnell on her chance meeting with arch-enemy Donald Trump\u2019s daughter Ivanka at a Manhattan restaurant.</p> <h2>\u2022\u2022\u2022</h2> <h2>Number</h2> <p><strong>72</strong>: times that Tim Kaine interrupted Mike Pence during the vice-presidential debate, according to a video, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kHqJGgdPe48\">Tim Kaine Interrupts</a>, compiled by the Republican National Committee.</p> <h2>\u2022\u2022\u2022</h2> <h2>Photo of the week</h2> <p>Ted Cruz, runner-up to Donald Trump in the Republican primary election, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/10/06/sad-ted-cruz-phone-banking-for-donald-trump-is-a-pretty-great-meme/\">phone banking</a> for the party and apparently telling whoever will listen: \u201cI coulda been a contender.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2746de7a17128f3925f7b27e498417248e71064e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2746de7a17128f3925f7b27e498417248e71064e/31_0_682_409/500.png\" alt=\"Ted Cruz, manning a Trump phone bank.\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ted Cruz, manning a Trump phone bank.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Twitter/@dallasnews</span> </figcaption> </figure>",
  "<p>It\u2019s going to get worse for Donald Trump and his Republican party. Much worse.</p> <p>Normal candidates might have realized they were bumping along the bottom of their election \u2013 if not, their life \u2013 when video emerged of them bragging, as a newlywed, about forcing themselves on women, genitals and all.</p> <p>But not the man who promises to make America great again. No, Donald Trump\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/08/donald-trump-forced-into-apology-as-sex-boast-tape-horrifies-republicans\">so-called apology video</a> was even more incompetent and incoherent than the rest of his campaign to date. And that\u2019s quite an achievement for a man who has attacked a grieving, Gold Star family.</p> <p>Trump pretended he was a different man. A changed man. A man humbled by meeting real people on the campaign trail.</p> <p>\u201cAnyone who knows me, knows these words don\u2019t reflect who I am,\u201d he said, before dismissing the whole thing as a distraction. But then he dropped the humility and apology shtick for not-so-subtle hint of how he intends to play this.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve said some foolish things, but there\u2019s a big difference between the words and actions of other people,\u201d he said. \u201cBill Clinton has actually abused women, and Hillary has bullied, attacked, shamed and intimidated his victims.\u201d</p> <p>If you think talk of sex is a distraction, you probably shouldn\u2019t make it clear you\u2019re going to continue the conversation at the next TV debate.</p> <p>And you probably shouldn\u2019t attack a wife for her husband\u2019s affairs if you want to win back a couple of women voters. Even if that wife is your opponent. </p> <p>Then again, this is a Republican nominee who urged the world via Twitter to check out the non-existent sex tape of a former Miss Universe who criticized him for demeaning her. This is a presidential candidate who has <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeed.com/andrewkaczynski/donald-trump-appeared-in-a-2000-playboy-softcore-porn?utm_term=.hm3KEJnjd#.yfABzQJr0\">made an appearance in part of</a> a soft porn video. This is a supposed leader who takes political advice from Roger Ailes, who was forced out of Fox News after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/jul/21/roger-ailes-sexual-harassment-accusations-fox-news\">numerous allegations</a> of sexual harassment.</p> <p>This is Donald Trump: a man no longer fit for polite company. His name will be torn off walls just as Ailes\u2019 was. Republican candidates up and down the land will be chased to election day with their previous endorsements and quotes praising the groper-in-chief.</p> <p>Condemning Trump\u2019s words will not be enough to save them. It was just a few days ago that the US senator in New Hampshire, Kelly Ayotte, said \u201cabsolutely\u201d when asked if she would tell kids to look up to Trump. She has <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2016/10/sen-ayotte-trump-absolutely-a-role-model-for-kids-229076\">since said</a> she \u201cmisspoke\u201d. But no amount of regret and criticism will erase that foolish misjudgment.</p> <p>Ayotte\u2019s misjudgment is really shared by an entire party establishment that is now stampeding for the doors. Republican leaders thought they could cutely tiptoe between their Trump-loving base and Trump-disgusted moderates. Just as they have tried to appease the Tea Party, Obama-hating fringe for the last eight years. Now they find themselves consumed by their own compromises.</p> <p>You know it when you see it. That moment when an election turns decisively. Not a blip, not a gaffe, not a bad few days. But instead the point of no return for candidates and undecided voters alike.</p> <p>In 2008 you could sense it in the 24-hour period around the first debate: when John McCain suspended his campaign, then revived it, ahead of his big moment on stage with Barack Obama. Erratic was the rap against McCain, and erratic was how he behaved.</p> <p>Four years later, it came with the 47% video of Mitt Romney talking at a private fundraiser. Out-of-touch elitist was the caricature, and that\u2019s how Romney sounded behind closed doors.</p> <p>Now we have the grotesque video of Donald Trump bragging: \u201cGrab them by the pussy. You can do anything.\u201d With it, Trump showed he is indeed the sum of all the sexist snippets we\u2019ve heard so far.</p> <p>The basket of deplorables just found their Mr Universe.</p> <p>There is no point in pretending that Trump can claw his way back from here. He has now confirmed that he disdains women, and many women voters will surely return the favor.</p> <p>Until now, Trump\u2019s defenders liked to justify his remarks about Rosie O\u2019Donnell and Megyn Kelly by saying that the GOP nominee was just an entertainer. That\u2019s not possible any more. Trump\u2019s disgusting comments were made in private, not as a public performance. And that\u2019s precisely why they are indelible.</p> <p>Trump was hardly in good shape with women voters before he slobbered over the prospect of assaulting them. They have represented the majority for almost 40 years of presidential elections, and this cycle will be no exception.</p> <p>Given his disastrous position with minorities, Trump\u2019s sole hope was to win among white voters. But he was already losing to Clinton among white women: a voting group that Romney won. There simply aren\u2019t enough white voters for Trump to win without sweeping the votes of white women.</p> <p>\u201cI pledge to be a better man tomorrow and will never, ever let you down,\u201d Trump said in his half-baked apology video.</p> <p>Of all the unbelievable words that have come out of his pouting lips, these may be the least credible. Donald Trump will let his party down on Sunday, live on national television. The only remaining question in this election is whether his party can rescue anything of its own reputation even as he flushes his own down the sewer.</p> <p>On the campaign trail John McCain liked to quote the bleak joke from Charles Schulz, the cartoon creator of the perennial loser Charlie Brown: \u201cIt always looks darkest just before it gets totally black.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s time to say good night to the Republican party as we have known it for the last eight years.</p>",
  "<p>There is no good time for party leaders to call the actions of their presidential candidate \u201csickening\u201d, \u201cdespicable\u201d and \u201cvile\u201d, but such a chorus of condemnation 31 days before an election that is already sliding out of view suggests more than just the White House is at stake.<br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/08/donald-trump-forced-into-apology-as-sex-boast-tape-horrifies-republicans\">Donald Trump forced into apology as sex boast tape horrifies Republicans</a> </p> </aside>  <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/08/donald-trump-forced-into-apology-as-sex-boast-tape-horrifies-republicans\">Reaction to hearing Donald Trump boast of molesting women</a>, in a tape reported by the Washington Post, was particularly fierce among Republicans in Congress, who are not only worried about losing control of the Senate but perhaps even the House of Representatives too, with this man at the top of their ticket.</p> <p>To see Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, describing the taped comments as showing \u201cutter lack of respect for women\u201d and the House speaker, Paul Ryan, quickly canceling a planned campaign event was on one level unsurprising.

A lawyer who represents several women to have made unproven allegations against Bill Clinton \u2013 including Juanita Broaddrick, Kathleen Willey, Paula Jones and Dolly Kyle \u2013 claims that her offer to bring one of them to sit in the front row at St Louis was <a href=\"http://pagesix.com/2016/10/05/trump-i-wont-mention-bill-clintons-past-at-next-debate/\">rebuffed by the Trump campaign</a>, because he wanted to \u201ctake the high road\u201d rather than focus on sleaze.</p> <p>The tactics adopted by Trump on Sunday will also be heavily shaped by his choice of advisers. The New Jersey governor, Chris Christie, and former New York mayor Rudy Giuliani are <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2016/09/29/politics/donald-trump-debate-chris-christie/\">thought to have played a much closer role</a> this time around after Roger Stone and Roger Ailes \u2013 two media veterans without extensive political experience, the latter with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/sep/06/fox-news-gretchen-carlson-settlement-roger-ailes\">a sexual harassment scandal of his own</a> \u2013 were blamed for encouraging him to skip lengthy preparations for the first debate.</p> <p>Christie in particular has proved a highly effective and pugnacious debater in the past, helping to destroy the 2016 presidential hopes of Marco Rubio in a primary debate when he mocked the Florida senator\u2019s habit of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/feb/07/republican-debate-new-hampshire-marco-rubio-chris-christie-donald-trump-ted-cruz\">repeating fixed talking points</a>.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/07/billy-bush-donald-trump-lewd-comments-tape-arianne-zucker\">Who is Billy Bush: the man egging on Trump in tape about groping women</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Yet fears that the Trump campaign is in freefall were exacerbated on Friday before the release of the taped remarks, by reports that it had canceled planned television advertising in key target states \u2013 a sign perhaps of cash shortages or that he is dialling back expectations of actually winning and wants instead to minimise the humiliation.</p> <p>A separate leak of a Trump tax return revealing he may have avoided paying income tax for nearly two decades by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/02/donald-trump-federal-income-tax-new-york-times\">booking a loss of $916m</a> has further dented his reputation for business acumen and empathy for hard-working taxpayers.</p> <p>Clinton, meanwhile, has continued her habit of extensive preparation, though not using a stand-in for Trump as she did before the first debate.</p> <p>\u201cHillary did a lot of town hall debates and a lot of town halls during the course of the primaries and into the general,\u201d her campaign chairman, John Podesta, told reporters on Wednesday, after five hours of policy rehearsal over strawberries at the family home in Washington.</p> <p>\u201cShe\u2019s very used to the format.

  "<p>One year ago this week, I was sitting in a cramped hotel room with 15 other staffers in Las Vegas for Bernie Sanders\u2019 first debate for the presidential nomination. The question came from CNN: \u201cWhat is the greatest national security threat?\u201d Pundits <a href=\"http://www.factcheck.org/2015/11/sanders-on-climate-link-to-terrorism/\">criticized and mocked</a> him for weeks after he answered \u201cclimate change\u201d. But he was right.</p> <p>And it\u2019s not just Sanders pointing out the imminent threat posed by climate change to global and national security. CIA analysts and our nation\u2019s military strategists are rightfully naming it as a contributor to refugee flows, the spread of disease, and conflicts over basic resources like food and water.</p> <p>In 2014, <a href=\"http://www.ips-dc.org/report-combat-vs-climate/\">17.5 million people were displaced</a> by climate-related disasters. Those numbers will continue to rise dramatically in the coming decades, according to climate displacement program manager Alice Thomas of Refugees International.</p> <p>Our nation\u2019s defense officials know <a href=\"http://www.acq.osd.mil/ie/download/CCARprint_wForeword_c.pdf\">global warming\u2019s destructive forces could undermine fragile governments</a> in unstable regions of the world where extremist ideologies can take root. Yet mainstream Republican avoidance of reality on the science of climate change impedes the necessary reassignment of resources to meet the challenges posed.</p> <p>Now <a href=\"http://www.ips-dc.org/report-combat-vs-climate/\">a new report from the Institute of Policy Studies</a> provides the most accurate calculation of government spending on climate security to date. The picture isn\u2019t pretty. We\u2019re spending 28 times as much on military security than climate security. A public sector investment of $55bn per year is required to meet the challenge, according to the study. With $21bn in the 2017 budget, a shortfall of $34bn is left.</p> <p>That may seem like an insurmountable hill to climb. It\u2019s not! As the IPS report points out, plenty of money lies untouched in the nation\u2019s bloated military budget.</p> <p>The F-35 fighter plane program is a prime candidate for big cuts. It\u2019s the most expensive weapon ever designed, complete with massive cost overruns. The sad cherry on top: the military admits that <a href=\"http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2016/03/17/military-admits-billion-dollar-war-toy-f-35-is-f-ked.html\">this plane just doesn\u2019t work</a>. If we turned back now, IPS says we could build enough offshore wind farms to power 320,000 homes for millions of people.</p> <p>Savings from gutting a Navy program designed to build close-to-shore combat ships would provide enough funds to retrain more than 150,000 coal industry workers. The ships have been <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2016/09/12/politics/us-navy-littoral-combat-ship-overhaul/\">plagued with mechanical errors</a>. Our own Government Accountability Office says the \u201cactual lethality and survivability performance of LCS is still largely unproven through realistic testing\u201d. <a href=\"http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/12/22/Has-Navy-Wasted-Billions-Its-New-Combat-Ship\">Others have called</a> the ships an outright \u201cwaste\u201d. Retraining and redistributing our fossil-fuel workforce to green jobs would be a welcome reprioritization.</p> <p>Congress could harness additional savings by reducing service contracting and canceling other wasteful or unnecessary weapons programs. But one party largely stands in the way. Republicans are hell-bent on leading our country down an unforgivable road with grave consequences. Their party\u2019s nominee for president <a href=\"http://www.motherjones.com/environment/2016/09/trump-global-warming-hoax\">believes</a> that global warming is a hoax engineered by the Chinese. That would be comical if it weren\u2019t so dangerous.</p> <p>Rich Americans justify inaction by dismissing climate change as a far off problem that will affect others. But climate change is here and now. And while the sharpest edge of its destructive forces will sadly hurt people of color and lower-income the hardest, we\u2019re all in deep trouble.</p> <p>In an <a href=\"http://theweek.com/speedreads/653587/hurricane-matthew-kill-weather-channel-warns-unusually-blunt-psa\">unusually forceful public service announcement</a>, The Weather Channel this week warned Floridians that Hurricane Matthew would lead to a heartbreaking loss of life. Florida governor Rick Scott said: \u201cThis storm will kill you.\u201d These un-natural weather occurrences are becoming more and more frequent.</p> <p>My home state of California <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/04/09/doing-something-about-the-drought_n_7000126.html\">faces its worst drought in 1,200 years</a>. When I traveled home for the holidays two years ago, I saw the devastating impact of climate change firsthand. Where boats once sat docked in my hometown marina, <a href=\"http://www.upi.com/Science_News/2014/12/05/Californias-drought-worst-in-1200-years/7271417805105/\">only dust remained</a>. Climate scientists are telling us that the United States is not immune to the instability and infighting that will occur when populations are forced to fight over food and water. They need only look to California for confirmation, where northerners and southerners <a href=\"http://sacramento.cbslocal.com/2015/07/28/is-southern-california-sucking-northern-water-supply-dry-during-drought/\">argue fiercely over water access</a>.</p> <p>The only practical solution to curb unrest, suffering and death here and abroad is a massive redistribution of government money.

  "<p>India\u2019s supreme court has granted a divorce to a man on the grounds of \u201ccruelty\u201d after his wife refused to share a home with her in-laws, effectively ruling that a married woman must live with her husband\u2019s family.</p> <p>Justice Anil R Dave, one of the the most senior judges in India, said the wife\u2019s desire to leave her in-laws\u2019 home was inspired by \u201cwestern thought\u201d and violated traditional values of Indian Hindus.</p> <p>\u201cIn normal circumstances, a wife is expected to be with the family of the husband after the marriage,\u201d stated the <a href=\"http://www.thehindu.com/multimedia/archive/03037/Hindu_son_can_divo_3037056a.pdf\">supreme court ruling</a>, which also dismissed the wife\u2019s attempt to kill herself as a plot to \u201ctorture\u201d her husband and his relatives.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2016/aug/10/india-all-female-newspaper-khabar-lahariya-gender-taboos-old-news\">India\u2019s all-female paper goes digital to make gender taboos old news</a> </p> </aside>  <p>There is no legal obligation for men to live with their parents, so the ruling still allows couples to live independently if men choose to set up a separate home. But the case had been seen as a test, pitting the rights of women against traditional Hindu values.</p> <p>Activists said the ruling left millions of women who were in unhappy marriages or with abusive husbands even more vulnerable.</p> <p>\u201cIf you look at the language the court has used, it\u2019s very regressive,\u201d said Tenzing Chusang, from the <a href=\"http://www.lawyerscollective.org/wri\">Women\u2019s Rights Initiative</a>, a lawyers\u2019 collective. \u201cIf you make the grounds of divorce very lenient for men, it makes the woman very vulnerable.\u201d</p> <p>Divorce in India carries a huge stigma: there are few financial provisions for divorced women, and little legal support.</p> <p>Chusang said: \u201cIn India there\u2019s no such thing as shared matrimonial property or equal division of assets. All she gets if the husband divorces her, and that too after years of litigation, is a minimal maintenance payment. What can she do? She has to stay.\u201d</p> <p>The judge said the wife\u2019s claims that her husband was having an affair were fabricated, and that her suicide attempt was a devious attempt to manipulate her husband\u2019s family.</p> <p>He focused on the \u201ctremendous stress\u201d the husband might have faced if she had succeeded in killing herself. \u201cOne can imagine how a poor husband would get entangled into the clutches of law [after a suicide], which would virtually ruin his sanity, peace of mind, career and probably his entire life,\u201d the judgment said. <br></p> <p>It said a suicide attempt alone was grounds for ending a marriage. \u201cIn our opinion, only this one event was sufficient for the appellant husband to get a decree of divorce on the ground of cruelty,\u201d it said.</p> <p>The case, which has been moving through the glacially slow Indian justice system for more than two decades, was brought by a man from the southern Indian state of Karnataka. He wanted to divorce his wife after she insisted on leaving her in-laws\u2019 home, but had been denied a divorce by the high court.</p> <p>In India, women are expected to move in with the relatives of their husbands, follow the rules and customs of their home, and ideally, blend in seamlessly as a new daughter. <br></p> <p>But in reality forced or quickly arranged marriages mean many young women marry into a life of near slavery, being responsible for all household chores and expected to obey their in-laws\u2019 every demand. Often, they are barred from taking paid work, and have little control of the family purse. In rural areas, many women are prohibited from wearing western clothing, meeting friends after dark or leaving the house.</p> <p>Some women have been pushing back against these restrictions, as the wife in this case tried to do. But the judge ruled that the \u201cpious obligation\u201d of Hindu men to look after their parents took precedence over her wishes.</p> <p> \u201cIt is not a common practice or desirable culture for a Hindu son in India to get separated from his parents on getting married at the instance of the wife, especially when the son is the only earning member in the family,\u201d the ruling said.</p> <p>It is the latest blow for women\u2019s rights in a country where sexual violence and trafficking is common, marital rape is not a crime, and discrimination is endemic.</p> <p>In a 2012 poll of gender specialists around the world, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jul/23/why-india-bad-for-women\">India was voted the worst G20 country in which to be a woman</a>. It was ranked worse than Saudi Arabia, where women can\u2019t legally drive and were only allowed to vote for the first time in 2015. <br></p> <p>The ruling also risks entrenching a dangerously imbalanced sex ratio, by endorsing parental preference for sons, who are seen as being more likely to support their parents in old age. The 2011 census found that for every 1,000 boys, there were only 918 girls. Sex-selective abortion was believed to account for much of the gap.</p> <p>\u201cThe court is emphasising that it\u2019s the son\u2019s duty to look after his parents,\u201d said Chusang. \u201cSo basically it\u2019s saying that [a daughter] is not really part of the family. She\u2019s going to leave, she\u2019s never going to look after her parents in old age, and therefore she has no value.\u201d</p> <p><em>\u2022 In India, suicide hotlines <a href=\"http://www.suicide.org/hotlines/international/india-suicide-hotlines.html\">can be found here</a>.

We said it was nicely poised at half-time but I don\u2019t know that many saw that second half coming.</p> <p>Sydney arguably shaded the first half, but the Wanderers were not without their chances. As the match wore on though the combination of Bobo and Holosko really came to the fore. The Slovak in particular did brilliantly, first for his goal, but then especially for his role in the second. </p> <p>David Carney too was incredibly impressive, but there really wasn\u2019t anyone in a blue shirt who disappointed. It\u2019s a result that sends shudders across the league \u2013 teams will need to watch the tape closely to find cracks in this XI, they were reliable at the back, tenacious in midfield and dangerous up front.</p> <p>For Tony Popovic some very early headaches \u2013 for the second time this season his side have looked decidedly off the pace of key league rivals.</p> <p>Jumpei was a rare bright spot, and Martinez showed his potential in a brief cameo. But this looks a side still struggling to replace that host of quality players they lost in the off-season. Hamill tried hard but the loss of Scott Jamieson was keenly felt, and whereas Nichols and Bulut combined well in patches, you\u2019d imagine the Wanderers will need far more creativity in the front third if they\u2019re to pick apart rival defences.</p> <p>All in all though, a stunning display of attacking football in front of a giant crowd of 61,880. What a brilliant way to start the A-League 2016-17 season.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-10-08T11:20:42.382Z\">at 12.20pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57f8cf62e4b03258bcac599a\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-08T10:51:54.902Z\">11.51am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Full-time: Western Sydney Wanderers 0-4 Sydney FC</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>90 min: </strong>Jared Gillett\u2019s seen enough and he sinks his big green needle into the flailing neck of Western Sydney Wanderers.</p> <p>Brosque punches the air \u2013 the Sydney FC players raise their hands aloft, and it\u2019s a very grim close up of Tony Popovic on the touchline.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57f8cf0be4b05c2f1e953527\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-08T10:49:58.809Z\">11.49am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>90 min: </strong>Well, horrible reading this, if you\u2019re a Wanderers fan.

There\u2019s talk of a record regular season crowd coming through the turnstiles at ANZ Stadium (with Wanderers\u2019 normal home ground at Parramatta currently under renovation). And if that wasn\u2019t enough motivation, Sydney FC captain Alex Brosque lit the touch paper with some, well, frankly over the top comments midweek, in which he stated of the Wanderers players: \u201cWe hate every single one of them\u201d.</p> <p>Both the Wanderers and Sydney FC have had a huge turnover during the off-season. Graham Arnold presumably due to the incredibly disappointing season his chargers had last year. He\u2019d never coached a team that didn\u2019t make the finals; until then. In comes a raft of experienced faces, Socceroos Alex Wilkinson and Michael Zullo, as well as veteran shot-shopper Danny Vukovic to sure up defence. Their problems were up front though with last season\u2019s goal return a whopping goal-a-game less than Melbourne City across the regular season.</p> <p>In comes the delightfully named Bobo, who will be expected to lead the line, as well as re-engage the at times disappointing Filip Holosko.</p> <p>For Tony Popovic it was perhaps a case of being victims of their own success \u2013 key first team players Scott Jamieson, Mark Bridge and Dario Vidosic all saw moves overseas, while Spanish duo Andreu and Alberto as well as livewire winger Romeo Castelen presumably wanted too much more coin to stick around. It\u2019s a host of new faces therefore for the Wanderers, and while players like Jumpei Kusukami and Nicholas Martinez could prove tremendous players it\u2019s made for a disjointed pre-season for Western Sydney; no more evident then during their 4-1 FFA Cup mauling at the hands (or feet) of Melbourne City.</p> <p>Incidentally, no Nikolai Topor-Stanley for this key clash \u2013 he pays a heavy price for his needless dismissal in that game.</p> <p>History suggests Sydney FC have the wood over Wanderers in recent seasons, but you\u2019d imagine with so many new faces that\u2019s essentially moot. It could turn into a goal-laden end-to-end thriller, or a turgid, badly-natured arm-wrestle.</p> <p>Guess you\u2019ll just have to stick around to see which!</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57f89cb4e4b03258bcac58dd\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-08T07:15:45.194Z\">8.15am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Richard will be here shortly to take you through the eagerly anticipated first Sydney derby of 2016-17, but in the interim here\u2019s David Squires\u2019 A-League season preview.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/picture/2016/oct/06/david-squires-on-the-beginning-of-the-2016-17-a-league-season\">David Squires on ... the beginning of the 2016-17 A-League season</a> </p> </aside> </div>   </div>",

Certain<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGsUcPdPWBg\"> rock songs</a>, when played backward on a turntable, were said to pay tribute to the devil.

Stephen King, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/oct/06/clown-sightings-stephen-king-it-pennywise\">who has spoken out against the clown panic</a>, contributed a lot to the lore with his 1986 novel It. There was the menacing clown doll in Poltergeist, Heath Ledger\u2019s scary Joker, Juggalos and so much more. Put all of this together, add the internet and voila! A clown panic that is causing school closings and letters from principals and cops and the <a href=\"http://pix11.com/2016/10/05/police-schools-ban-clown-costumes-for-halloween-amid-creepy-sightings/\">banning of clownwear</a>. It has apparently even spread to a few other nations.</p> <p>I have no doubt that if I were walking down the street and noticed a clown in my peripheral vision, then confirmed it with a turn of my head, I would scream. Because the clown doesn\u2019t belong there. Because the clown is out of context. Because there\u2019s a clown panic going on and the clown\u2019s only reason for existing is spreading fear and dread. </p> <p>But what do the creepy clowns <em>mean</em>, wring a million hands. Perhaps it\u2019s just for fun. Perhaps it\u2019s anxiety over \u2026 the economy? Global warming? Social media?</p> <p>Bear with me \u2013 this is kind of a stretch \u2013 but could it be that a very big creepy clown is actually showing up and menacing us in our streets, woods and schools? That the fear he inspires is spreading, and it\u2019s unclear what is true and what is not? This clown\u2019s mask is a horror show in itself, he wears a terrible wig and, although it is said that he kids a lot, is never funny. </p> <p>One of the reasons that people cite for disliking clowns is the notion of the \u201cnearly human\u201d or uncanny valley, where you will find chill-inducing things like clowns, marionettes, monkeys, masks, mannequins, certain robots, scarecrows. In the 1980s, a time when nuclear war was very much on the minds of the people, we had a president who was uncanny, too. I remember getting a bag of Republican jellybeans with an elephant on the package when trick-or-treating on 31 October 1980. Reagan was famously fond of them. And holding the bag and thinking \u201cthis elephant is cute but I heard someone say he didn\u2019t want to die if Reagan was elected, because Reagan was going to start a nuclear war.\u201d </p> <p>Ronald Reagan, with his strange, molded, too-dark hair and rouged cheeks and permanent smile, was everything horrifying about the phrase \u201cAll-American\u201d. So twinkly and grandfatherly he was, but he also scared the hell out of many children who feared that nuking the Russians was going to happen if you said the wrong thing in front of Grandpa. And then the Russians would nuke back and next thing you know the skies are gray with fallout.</p> <p>Americans bought Reagan\u2019s act, though he was as creepy as they come, a poor simulation of humanity, a bona fide authoritarian wrapped in the cozy trappings of grandpa, sort of like the sadistic child-stalking Santa Claus. </p> <p>Of course, Reagan is the very soul of humanity compared with Great Killer Clown Donald J Trump, but most people are. I\u2019ve heard a few people say, \u201cHe makes me nostalgic for George Bush.\u201d </p> <p>I think this \u201cclown epidemic\u201d is a form of real-time trauma play. Right now, in this nation, on this planet, a bona fide human-like sociopath is very close to grabbing the One Ring of Power. Or the Former One Ring of Power that is Still Pretty Powerful. </p> <p>China may be the Coke of today and we may just be the Pepsi, which may partially explain the second-rate, rinky-dink two-bit hustler who has fooled millions of people into thinking he somehow cares about them, courting steelworkers as he loads his buildings with Chinese steel, pretending to care about small business owners while notoriously stiffing them for decades. </p> <p>Somewhere in their heads they must understand that they are not acting in their best interest, and this gigantic killer clown is using their despair and hopelessness against them by masterfully pulling their anger strings, turning them, too into ugly, disjointed residents of his angry uncanny valley. </p> <p>And Trump\u2019s dark undertow is pulling other killer clowns out of the shadows. Emboldened, they walk the streets, bearing the possibility that we, as a nation, may be stepping off a cliff of denial into a valley of hatred, fear and fascism.</p> <p>Obviously, it\u2019s time to panic over imaginary clowns.</p>",
  "<p>At breakfast in Vancouver just before her adopted sister disappears forever from her life, 11-year-old Marie, AKA Ma-li, forlornly submits to being consoled with a wordgame. She discovers that the Chinese ideogram for the verb \u201cto arrive\u201d <strong>\u6765 </strong>is made up of the radical for \u201ctree\u201d <strong>\u6728 </strong>and the word \u201cnot yet\u201d <strong>\u672a</strong>: \u201cArrival is a tree that is still to come.\u201d</p> <p>There are many translation games in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/jul/14/do-not-say-we-have-nothing-by-madeleine-thien-review-chinas-20th-century-tragedy\"><em>Do Not Say We Have Nothing</em></a><em>, </em>Madeleine Thien\u2019s powerful Man Booker-shortlisted novel: the difference between a world that is settled and secure and one that is constantly imperilled is enshrined in such fine conceptual differences of written language. In Thien\u2019s China, the thing that should have arrived is always still to come, whether it involves a missing person, a secret message or a better future.</p> <p>The games start with the title of the novel which is, Thien explains, the English transliteration of a line from the anthem of the Communist party of China, which was translated via Russian from the French socialist anthem \u201cThe Internationale\u201d.</p> <p>Thien is on her way to speak at the Edinburgh International book festival when we meet. The novel is just out and she is feeling \u201cbefuddled and amazed\u201d by her appearance on the Man Booker list. Though virtually unknown in the UK, the 42-year-old writer has won awards in her native Canada for a small but scorching oeuvre dealing with some of the toughest history of the modern age. Before this latest novel \u2013 described by Guardian reviewer Isabel Hilton as \u201ca moving and extraordinary evocation of the 20th-century tragedy of China\u201d \u2013 came <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/feb/15/dogs-perimeter-madeleine-thien-review\"><em>Dogs at the Perimeter</em></a>, which dealt with another great tragedy, the Cambodian genocide of the 1970s.</p> <p><em>Do Not Say We Have Nothing</em> opens in 1990 in the home of Marie, who disarmingly informs us that her Chinese nickname means \u201ccharming mineral\u201d. It was given to her by Ai-Ming, the daughter of mysteriously connected friends of her father, who has been adopted by her mother after fleeing the repercussions of the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests.</p> <p>Ai-Ming\u2019s arrival in Canada opens the door on 60 years of catastrophic history involving the families of two talented Chinese musicians, one of whom \u2013 Marie\u2019s father \u2013 defected to the west, while the other stayed in China. Both men are now dead, leaving their daughters to piece together their story.</p> <p>Like Marie, Thien is a child of several cultures who grew up in Canada. Her mother was a Cantonese speaker from Hong Kong while her father is Hakka, ethnically Chinese but born in a part of Malaysia that was once the British protectorate of north Borneo.</p> <p>Her parents met as students in Australia then settled in Malaysia until the region became dangerously unstable. They emigrated to Vancouver in 1974 with two small children and a plan to open a Chinese-Canadian diner, \u201cwhich would serve chop suey plus bacon and egg sandwiches\u201d. Thien was born two months later and the diner failed, which, she says, was just as well as she was diagnosed with a life-threatening kidney condition which kept her in hospital for six months, with her parents keeping vigil at her bedside.</p> <p>After that, \u201cit was a very typical immigrant story in the sense that they struggled for a long time and my mum had three jobs. I remember not seeing her. My dad was the one who was at home with us, but we did, as kids, spend a lot of time alone,\u201d she says.</p> <p>As the sole member of her family who was born in the west, Thien is the only one whose mother tongue is English. She has no Mandarin, but learned Cantonese as a child, and has \u201cthe writing age of an eight-year-old\u201d. As for speaking: \u201cMy mother used to say that my tones are all crooked: it\u2019s like hearing a song sung out of tune.\u201d</p> <p>The perspective of a child who is both insider and outsider is central to <em>Do Not Say We Have Nothing</em>. It makes Marie into a historical sleuth whose observations drill down through layer after layer of difference.</p> <p>In an early scene, she watches her mother using a dictionary to decipher a letter announcing Ai-Ming\u2019s imminent arrival, then responding by telephone, \u201c[speaking] in her mother tongue, Cantonese, with brief interjections of Mandarin\u201d. The reason Marie\u2019s trilingual mother has to read with a dictionary is because she is not fluent in the simplified Chinese script imposed by Mao.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2016/sep/15/the-man-booker-prize-2016-shortlist-a-judges-view\">The Man Booker prize 2016 shortlist \u2013 a judge\u2019s view</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The novel takes us back from the \u201c1989 generation\u201d who were caught up in Tiananmen Square to the \u201c1966 generation\u201d, who went through the Cultural Revolution. It turns out that Marie\u2019s father, Jiang Kai, was a concert pianist who was tutored at the Shanghai Conservatory by Ai-Ming\u2019s father, Sparrow, a talented composer. The closure of the conservatory in 1966 drove the two musicians into different versions of artistic exile. While Jiang Kai flees first to Beijing and later to Canada, Sparrow is thrown into a no-man\u2019s land of creative silence.</p> <p>One of the more bizarre facts of the Cultural Revolution was that while western music was being destroyed all over China, Mao had a symphony orchestra in Beijing. Thien builds this paradox into the fabric of the novel: it is structured as theme and variations, taking its cue from Sparrow\u2019s obsession with Bach\u2019s <em>Goldberg Variations</em>, as performed over several decades by the Canadian pianist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/glenn-gould\">Glenn Gould</a>.</p> <p>Thien was an idealistic 14-year-old Vancouver schoolgirl when the 1989 demonstrations began. \u201cIt was the first time I saw events outside unfolding in real time on CNN, and it was a parallel world. For a long time it looked as if it was going to turn out very differently: there was so much joy, as if people were finally going to have a say in what Chinese modernity would look like and in directing their country. Instead, a more authoritarian system became entrenched, and that\u2019s very shocking 27 years on.\u201d In the novel, Marie is too young to understand what is happening, but her incomprehension about her family\u2019s plight attaches itself to \u201cthose chaotic, frightening images of people and tanks, and my mother in front of the screen\u201d.</p> <p>Brusque but loving mothers recur through the novel. Thien\u2019s own was the eldest of 12 children. \u201cMy parents are quite reserved in English but funny and boisterous in their mother tongues,\u201d she says. \u201cSome of my best memories are of my mum sitting with her sisters and laughing and talking all night: that light emanating from her.\u201d</p> <p>As a solitary child, whose siblings \u201cwere older and didn\u2019t necessarily want to talk to me\u201d, she spent long hours on her own, walking to and from school through \u201cquite rough neighbourhoods\u201d, clutching \u201cthese magical things, books, that made an imaginative space other people could inhabit\u201d.</p> <p>She was a talented dancer, winning a scholarship to study contemporary dance and ballet at university, which she lost after becoming distracted by words. \u201cI came from quite a poor neighbourhood and didn\u2019t have access to ideas, so I did this silly thing. I was taking all these fourth year philosophy courses and it was a leap too great.\u201d</p> <p>Unable to support herself without the scholarship, she abandoned the course, and it was a while before she found a way of financing herself on the new journey of a literature degree. She emerged, aged 23, with \u201ca few short stories\u201d and took a clerical job at an academic press \u2013 \u201cthe perfect set of circumstances because the job was just the job and I could keep all that creative energy for trying to learn the art of short fiction\u201d.</p> <p>Then came the offer of a scholarship to do a master\u2019s degree in creative writing, \u201cand that was life changing\u201d. Thrift was one of the habits she is grateful to have learned from her mother: \u201cI wouldn\u2019t have gone into debt. Having enough money is important to me.\u201d She spent the first year working on the seven stories that would become her first book, <em>Simple Recipes</em>, devising a writing system that involved repeatedly abandoning and rewriting whole drafts.</p> <p>But a system that worked for a short stories caused problems when she set about her debut novel. \u201cThe trouble with that process of throwing it all out is that you lose some of the propulsion of the first draft. I was always retreating and losing the \u2018underdrawing\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>Her debut novel,<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2007/mar/17/featuresreviews.guardianreview20\"> <em>Certainty</em></a>, published in 2006, won two prizes in Canada but left her feeling dissatisfied. She had tried to tell the story of her father\u2019s Malaysian background, and says now, \u201cI felt I knew more than I did. It\u2019s a daughter\u2019s book: one I almost had to write so I could move on.\u201d</p> <p>The place she moved on to was Pol Pot\u2019s Cambodia, and a period of history from which few had emerged alive to tell the tale. Research for <em>Dogs at the Perimeter</em> involved travelling around the country for months. To her knowledge only the third novel ever to tackle the genocide of \u201cYear Zero\u201d, it carried a heavy burden of historical conscience, posing a question that has become central to her literary project: \u201cIf a person erases him or herself in order to survive, how can they find that self again? Can survival bring them peace, or is it only madness to remember?\u201d</p> <p><em>Do Not Say We Have Nothing</em> makes the surprising suggestion that part of the solution might lie in the act of copying. The different generations of Marie and Ai-Ming\u2019s families are connected by the manuscript of a novel, \u201cThe Book of Records\u201d, chapters of which have been carefully copied out, hidden in walls and beneath floorboards, and passed from hand to hand.<em> \u201c</em>The Book of Records\u201d is precious because it represents a narrative that doesn\u2019t conform to the approved version of Chinese history, Thien explains. \u201cIt\u2019s a book with no beginning, no middle and no end, in which the characters are seeing an alternative China where they recognise mirrors of themselves and which they write themselves into.\u201d</p> <p>She is speaking literally as well as metaphorically. \u201cThe act of copying is different in China because part of the art of calligraphy is that you learn to write as the masters did. It\u2019s a lot about breath and pressure and line. You\u2019re almost learning to breathe in the same line as the masters, and when you\u2019ve learned, you find your own expression. It\u2019s metaphorically powerful because it\u2019s how we all learn. I have some of my mother\u2019s gestures. My handwriting is the same as hers.\u201d</p> <p>Her mother\u2019s death, just after Thien\u2019s first book was published, was the spur to leave Vancouver.

  "<p>When Uber chose to test its robot-driven taxis in Pittsburgh, some may have wondered why the tech company had chosen America\u2019s former capital of steel for its road test into the future.

The city is now in a position to capitalize on the infrastructure of the past in ways that could not have been anticipated at the depths of its post-industrial depression two decades ago, when the city\u2019s population was half its industry peak and the unemployment rate was worse than in Detroit.</p> <p>Last week, the city hosted Thrival, a three-day showcase of panel discussions and exhibitions designed to show off the city\u2019s post-industrial charms. From robotics to biotech, performing arts to healthcare, the city\u2019s premier boosters \u2013 many locals or returning natives \u2013 sought to describe the city\u2019s upswing. </p> <p>The twin keys to the city\u2019s current success, says the festival\u2019s executive producer, Dan Law, are education and medicine \u2013 eds and meds \u2013 that helped bridge the gap between old industrial Pittsburgh and a new Pittsburgh that\u2019s about innovation and technology. Now, instead of leaving, students from Pittsburgh\u2019s tech university departments have more options to stay.</p> <p>\u201cEds and meds are the bedrock of the economic transition,\u201d says Law. \u201cUPMC \u2013 University of Pittsburgh Medical Center \u2013 alone is a $13bn health system and there are dozens of ancillary industries that began to innovate. So young people started to get jobs here and economic growing around the core economic pillars.\u201d</p> <p>Correspondingly, the city\u2019s arts and culture are thriving. \u201cThe City of Bridges is in the throes of a full-on nose-to-tail, barrel-aged, small-plates culinary renaissance,\u201d according to <a href=\"http://www.bonappetit.com/restaurants-travel/navigator/article/pittsburgh-navigator\">Bon Appetit </a>magazine.

At least three towns in the hills and coast of Haiti\u2019s fertile western tip reported dozens of people killed, including the farming village of Chantal where the mayor said 86 people died, mostly when trees crushed houses. Food was scarce in Haiti and at least seven people died of cholera, likely because of flood water mixing with sewage. The Mesa Verde, a US Navy amphibious transport dock ship, was heading for Haiti to support relief efforts. </p> <p>Matthew has also triggered mass evacuations along the US coast from Florida through Georgia and into South Carolina and North Carolina.

The geometry changes over the next 24h (beginning Friday evening) because the coastline of Georgia, South Carolina, and North Carolina bends back to the northeast. </p> <p>Although the storm may also start bending more to the northeast, that probably won\u2019t happen until the storm center draws nearer to the coastline. The storm may actually make a brief landfall in South Carolina on Friday as a category 1 or 2 hurricane. The storm did not make landfall in Florida which was a great relief because that kept the strongest winds just offshore.</p> <p>Although the most intense winds stayed offshore, bands of moderately strong winds and intense rains are hundreds of miles across and have produced heavy rain and large storm surges along the coast. That will continue into Georgia and the Carolinas tonight and tomorrow. <br></p> <p>So Georgia, South Carolina, and maybe southeastern North Carolina are likely to see some coastal flooding.

In a category 3 hurricane, winds of up to 129mph are expected, homes are likely to be damaged, and trees will be uprooted, blocking roads. Power and water outages are also likely and could last \u201cseveral days to weeks after the storm passes\u201d.</p> <p>Pretty much the only comfort to be had is the fact that Matthew is no longer expected to be a category 4 hurricane \u2013 these are classed as causing \u201ccatastrophic\u201d damage, with roofs ripped off houses and walls blown down in winds of up to 156mph, leaving residential areas cut off by fallen trees and power poles, and the area \u201cuninhabitable for weeks or months\u201d.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-10-07T09:03:38.057Z\">at 10.03am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57f745cee4b05c2f1e952ead\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-07T07:07:53.799Z\">8.07am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>If you\u2019re in the region, you can share your experiences of what it\u2019s like where you are by filling in the form below, or by clicking on the blue \u2018Contribute\u2019 button at the top of this article.

And as many Floridians heeded calls to evacuate, both candidates began the delicate and difficult task of pursuing votes during a crisis. </p> <p>Clinton\u2019s campaign asked the state for more time to register voters a request Florida governor Rick Scott rejected and the Trump team pulled its negative TV ads. </p> <p>\u201cIt looks like it\u2019s a big one and it\u2019s going to be a bad one,\u201d said Trump at a town hall in New Hampshire. \u201cPlease know that we are praying for you and everyone in the path: You\u2019ve got to take care of yourself, you\u2019ve got to get out of the area, you\u2019ve got to listen.\u201d </p> <p>The hurricane is expected to hit Trump\u2019s prized Mar-a-Lago resort in Palm Beach. Campaign spokeswoman Hope Hicks said, \u201cMr. Trump spoke with employees yesterday to ensure they are safe and following instructions from local officials.\u201d </p> <p>Clinton tweeted: \u201cHurricane Matthew is a major storm. ... Stay safe Florida.\u201d </p> <p>Both stayed far away, preparing for their second debate, a town hall-style faceoff on Sunday in St. Louis. Trump was holding a dry run town hall in Sandown, New Hampshire, while Clinton was speaking at fundraisers in New York. </p> <p>Along the Southeast coast, Matthew was expected to bring dangerous conditions to Georgia, South Carolina and, possibly, North Carolina. But it was the impact on vote-rich Florida, a must-win state for Trump, that had the campaigns on high alert. The hurricane closed in just as both sides ramped up their early-vote push and just days before a voter registration deadline. </p> <p>Vote-by-mail ballots are being sent to voters across the state this week, leaving the potential for ballots to arrive just as voters temporarily abandon their homes. So far, a record 2.5 million people nearly one-third of those who voted in 2012 have made requests for the early ballots. </p> <p><strong>Scott said Thursday evening that he would not consider extending the 11 October voter registration deadline. </strong></p> <p>\u201cEveryone has had a lot of time to register,\u201d Scott said, adding, \u201cI don\u2019t intend to make any changes.\u201d </p> <p>Scott, a Republican, is a strong supporter of GOP nominee Donald Trump and chairman of a Super PAC running Clinton-bashing television ads. </p> <p>Disruptions in Florida campaigning were immediate. In Palm Beach County, local Republican Chairman Michael Barnett said Matthew already had forced cancellations, including phone-banking operations and an event where Ivanka Trump was the headliner.

  "<p>It was another torrid summer. During southern California\u2019s Del Mar meet, which ran from July through September, 17 horses were died during training of a morning or racing of an afternoon. On the other side of the country, 10 horses died during training or racing during Saratoga\u2019s 40-day meet in New York. This follows a similar scenario in 2014, when both tracks endured double-digit fatalities.</p> <p>Criticism has been harsh and intense. At Del Mar, as the number of deaths grew, protesters <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/events/620376118127850/\">picketed</a> the entrance to the track, carrying placards with slogans like \u201cRacing to the Grave\u201d and \u201cRaced to Death at Del Mar.\u201d Tensions spilled over at an August California Horse Racing Board meeting, when one animal rights advocate after another publicly denounced the deaths, some of them calling for the immediate closure of the track.</p> <p>What makes these figures so glaring is that they run counter to an overall decline in fatal race-day injuries. Between 2014 and 2015, <a href=\"http://jockeyclub.com/default.asp?section=Advocacy&amp;area=10\">fatalities decreased</a> by 14%, with the 2015 national average standing at 1.62 fatalities per 1,000 starts. At Del Mar and Saratoga this year, fatality rates were 2.42 and 1.81 per 1,000 starts respectively.</p> <p>That both racecourses have taken a number of major steps in recent years to reduce fatalities has caused further soul-searching. Officials have sought accreditation with the <a href=\"https://www.ntra.com/safety-integrity-alliance/\">National Thoroughbred Racing Association\u2019s Safety &amp; Integrity Alliance</a>, for one, and have tightened pre-race examination procedures. But as two of the nation\u2019s highest profile meets continue to court all the wrong kind of attention, the need for answers is becoming critical.</p> <p>***</p> <p>The problem is, these answers aren\u2019t always easy to come by. At a <a href=\"http://courses.grayson-jockeyclub.org/courses/WSS/WSS_V/story.html\">Jockey Club Welfare and Safety of the Racehorse summit</a> meeting only a couple of years ago, Dr Lisa Hanelt, a veterinarian at the Finger Lakes Racetrack in New York, ticked off a laundry list of possible variables behind any one racehorse fatality: how every racetrack is different, predisposing horses to slightly different injuries. How horses pitted into races above their class can expose them to heightened duress during a race. And how horses trained for too many consecutive months can exacerbate physical wear and tear.</p> <p>Over the years, a variety of track officials and organizations have collected catastrophic-injury data to better understand these causes. The most extensive database is in California, where a record of racehorse deaths has been kept since 1990. From this database, Dr Rick Arthur, the CHRB\u2019s equine medical director, has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/aug/03/drugs-dead-horses-us-racing-peta-video\">found</a> that between 85% and 90% of all fatal musculoskeletal injuries have pre-existing pathology at the site of the fatal injury.</p> <p>Which leads to the use and misuse of drugs in the sport, and the potential for medications to mask potentially catastrophic injuries. Jeff Blea, a racetrack veterinarian in southern California who worked and treated horses at Del Mar this summer, believes that the tougher medications rules implemented in California over the past few years make it \u201cunlikely\u201d that the abuse of medications played a factor in any of the fatalities.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not the medication, even though it\u2019s the lightning rod,\u201d he said. \u201cThe lines have been pushed so far back, it\u2019s actually now a better mechanism for the welfare of the horse.\u201d Still, for many others, the issue of drugs is a hard one to dismiss.</p> <p>A <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/apr/28/horse-racing-corticosteroid-joint-injections-drug-debate-issue\">Guardian</a> investigation earlier this year found that intra-articular corticosteroids continue to be \u201cmisused\u201d by some within the industry, despite significant efforts to curb their prevalence. This past weekend alone, Hall of Fame jockey Chris McCarron spoke at a <a href=\"http://www.paulickreport.com/news/people/mccarron-drugs-dont-kill-horses-people-kill-horses/\">Thoroughbred Club of America</a> event about the multitude of reasons why fatal breakdowns happen, saying that \u201cthe number one reason is discretion: what to do with a horse that\u2019s infirm, what to do with a horse that needs rest instead of therapy.\u201d</p> <p>As the cache of information on fatalities keeps growing, experts have been able to identify types of horses at greater risk of fatal injury. At a 2011 <a href=\"http://www.jockeyclub.com/default.asp?section=RT&amp;year=2011&amp;area=3\">Jockey Club Round Table Conference</a>, leading veterinarian Dr Tim Parkin identified eight different factors associated with an increased risk of catastrophic lower limb fracture during a race. These factors include horses that have not raced in the past 15-30 days, horses that had their first start in the last nine months, and horses with numerous starts in the past one to six months. Thirteen of the 21 horses fatally injured at <a href=\"http://www.governor.ny.gov/sites/governor.ny.gov/files/archive/assets/documents/Report.pdf\">Aqueduct</a> during the fall and winter of 2011 and 2012 had six or more of these factors present.</p> <p>So, are there any identifiable trends among the fatalities this summer at Del Mar and Saratoga? It should be noted that not all of the horses fatally injured during a race suffered lower limb fractures. But using the eight factors identified by Parkin, one of the six horses fatally injured during racing at Saratoga had six or more of the risk factors present. Of the seven horses fatally injured at Del Mar during a race, none had six or more of the risk factors present.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ve looked at the facts, and there is no trend there,\u201d said the CHRB executive director, Rick Baedeker. \u201cThe only one that is identifiable is that a number of horses, I think it was six, had significant gaps in training during the last 12 or 18 months. In a sense, that\u2019s helpful, because we can address that.\u201d</p> <p>Using necropsy, veterinary, training and race records, a review panel in New York is working on a report similar to the <a href=\"https://www.gaming.ny.gov/pdf/11.09.15.Saratoga2014Report.pdf\">one</a> put together in response to the fatalities that occurred during the summer of 2014. The latest report is expected out soon. In California, the necropsy findings are similarly unavailable as yet.</p> <p>During the wait for these results here in California, criticism among many trainers, jockeys, owners and exercise riders has circled the Del Mar racetrack surface, with fingers pointed at the racetrack\u2019s consistency and moisture levels \u2013 components integral to a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/sep/23/racing-racetrack-surfaces-horse-deaths\">safe racing surface</a>. And they feel that the sheer volume of horses training and racing on the track during the short meet has only magnified this problem.</p> <p>Hovering in the background is Del Mar\u2019s switch last year from a synthetic surface back to dirt \u2013 a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/sep/23/racing-racetrack-surfaces-horse-deaths\">statistically</a> more dangerous surface than a synthetic one. According to <a href=\"http://jockeyclub.com/pdfs/eid_7_year_tables.pdf\">Jockey Club</a> findings, between 2009-2015, 1.22 horses per 1000 starts were fatally injured in races on a synthetic surface. Switch that to dirt, and 2.04 horses per 1,000 starts were fatally injured.</p> <p>This summer, as the number of fatalities began to rise, management at both venues recruited Dr Mick Peterson \u2013 an expert in the field of racetrack surfaces \u2013 to evaluate the quality of each track.</p> <p>Both racecourses participate in the <a href=\"http://bioappeng.us/track/mqsdemo.php?v=OEPgHAeo\">Maintenance Quality System</a> program, where a series of daily measurements \u2013 moisture, cushion depth and other measures of track consistency, in addition to surface composition and mechanical testing \u2013 are taken and added to an online database. Peterson and racetrack officials correlated this data with what information was available about the fatalities, and scrutinized the combined findings for patterns or anomalies.</p> <p>\u201cThe challenge with this is that nothing stood out,\u201d said Peterson, who did additional soil testing at both tracks. \u201cThe success is, as soon as there were questions, we knew exactly what we had to do, and wanted to do.\u201d</p> <p>With no concrete answers emerging, some are speculating. Jim Cassidy, the president of California Thoroughbred Trainers, believes that \u201cboutique\u201d meets like Saratoga and Del Mar \u2013 short high-profile meets with large purses that are extremely popular with owners and race-goers \u2013 can create a perfect storm, where all the variables that factor into any one fatal injury are exacerbated by the hyper-competitive nature of the racing product.</p> <p>\u201cI know some people who feel as though they have no choice, and in that situation it\u2019s sad,\u201d said Cassidy, about trainers who he feels are pressured by owners to run horses that perhaps shouldn\u2019t compete, and ordinarily wouldn\u2019t. \u201cIn those cases, owners need to realize those horses aren\u2019t going to get them anything anyway, just a place in the starting gate.\u201d</p> <p>Before the end of the meet at Del Mar, the CHRB held individual private \u201cstakeholder\u201d meetings with trainers, jockeys, veterinarians, and track management, for their thoughts on the high number of fatalities the high number of fatalities, as well as to propose possible fixes to the problem.</p> <p>\u201cConcern for the industry is shared by all,\u201d said Baedeker. \u201cI think people realize that something needs to be done. That\u2019s probably the easy part. What to do is the challenge.\u201d</p> <p>Next year, Del Mar will open a week early to give horses extra time to acclimatize to the surface, and track management slightly more wriggle room to get things right. Other ideas floated at the stakeholder meetings included greater medical scrutiny of horses returning to the track after a significant lay-off. A CHRB member <a href=\"http://www.bloodhorse.com/horse-racing/articles/214504/chrb-member-calls-for-trainer-profiling\">recently called</a> for heightened trainer \u201cprofiling.\u201d</p> <p>Many are supportive of these possible changes, however small. At the same time, however, others push for more drastic changes to be made if the industry is to repair its damaged public image \u2013 a tension that mirrors the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/sep/16/standard-issue-drug-testing-far-from-uniform-in-american-horse-racing\">industry\u2019s divided approach</a> to the far from unrelated issue of drug reform, where some advocate for the continued incremental state-by-state implementation of the National Uniform Medication Program, while others push for legislation like the Barr-Tonko bill that would enact wholesale drug reform at the federal level.</p> <p>\u201cIf major changes aren\u2019t made, racing will be fazed out. It\u2019s not a question of if, it\u2019s when,\u201d said Dan Blacker, a young trainer based in southern California. Blacker proposed a number of short-term and long-term solutions, from mandatory x-rays of horses\u2019 joints before they run, to the closure of racetracks as training centers and an increase in private training facilities, significantly lessening the general wear and tear racetracks suffer.</p> <p>\u201cThis is an opportunity to change things for the better,\u201d Blacker said. \u201cWe\u2019re at a turning point in California whereby we\u2019re able to be leaders on this subject.\u201d</p>",

A local tells me that when the livestock market was in its heyday (it closed in 2002), this was where well-to-do farmers enjoyed steak-and-kidney pudding served on white tablecloths, while their farmhands caroused at the <a href=\"http://www.thegreendragonbeverley.co.uk/\">Green Dragon</a> across the square.</p> <p>A revamp last year underlines the cut-above feel: the bar was moved and enlarged, so a drinks menu that includes craft ales (of course) and well-priced wines could be widened to house a cocktail station. I find it hard to choose between Gin &amp; Juice \u2013 with elderflower cordial, lemon and apple juice and blackberries \u2013 and Bison Berry \u2013 vodka, Tuaca, blackcurrant liqueur, cranberry juice, vanilla and lemon (both \u00a36.95). There\u2019s a Josper grill for cooking well-bred, well-aged beef from a farm near Leeds, and a wood-fired pizza oven.</p> <p>Our bedroom reinforces my feelings of design inadequacy, with its clever mix of steampunk and industrial chic: oversized houndstooth-check carpet, vintage film spotlight, huge gilt mirror leaning against a wall, and metal pendant lights instead of bedside lamps. Husband isn\u2019t sure about the big white-feather ceiling globe, but I like this bonkers touch. We\u2019ve a freestanding bath and a separate shower in herringbone brick. I won\u2019t copy any of this at home, but it\u2019s a fun space.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"572bc17538bc23e0cddbdf5fa28ce6e42b6b5208\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/572bc17538bc23e0cddbdf5fa28ce6e42b6b5208/0_187_5610_3366/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The bar at The King\u2019s Head, Beverley\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>The King\u2019s Head may be one up from a boozer, but can still get noisy on Saturdays \u2013 overnight guests are offered earplugs. We\u2019re there on a peaceful Sunday, though, and sit for ages at a bay-window table downstairs, watching comings and goings on Saturday Market, the town\u2019s main square (Wednesday Market is to the south, near the Minster).</p> <p>The menu, when we get round to ordering, is not as eclectic as the decor: steaks (from \u00a315.95), burgers and pizzas (one with confit garlic, smoked mackerel and prawns does sound unusual, however), and starters of the chicken wings, sweet potato falafel, glazed mini sausages variety. But, as our wise local said, there are fine-dining options elsewhere in Beverley. We enjoy mains of spatchcocked piri-piri chicken (\u00a310.95) and fish and chips (\u00a39.50 \u2013 fish, usually haddock, is always a good bet near the Yorkshire coast), and the triple-cooked chips are moreish. A shared cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e is as good as any we\u2019ve had in France.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ce6d0ecf9e49aaf56f5a7af52994b13be0450040\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ce6d0ecf9e49aaf56f5a7af52994b13be0450040/0_192_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Dining room at the King\u2019s Head, Beverley\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>We\u2019re still feeling well-fed when we go to breakfast next morning, but anyone hoping for a sumptuous spread would be disappointed. My smoked salmon and cream cheese muffin is fine, and the bacon I pinch from husband\u2019s full English is delicious, but there\u2019s little to go before or after it, just boxed cereals and a basket of oranges and tasteless apples. A place that can craft a killer cocktail could surely run to granola, compote and croissants.</p> <p>But no one could be disappointed with the service: breakfast staff are as delightful as those who welcomed us the previous day and went out of their way to help us bag a space in the car park and a good table (they\u2019re like this with everyone, I\u2019m assured). If only they could offer someone to come and sprinkle some design magic on our dining room at home. <br>\u2022 <em>Accommodation was provided by the King\u2019s Head, Beverley, 01482 868103, </em><a href=\"http://kingsheadpubbeverley.com/\"><em>kingsheadpubbeverley.com</em></a><em>, doubles from \u00a380 B&amp;B</em></p> <h2><strong>Ask a local</strong><br></h2> <p><strong>Julian Minshall, editor, </strong><a href=\"http://justbeverley.co.uk/magazine\"><strong>Just Beverley</strong></a><strong> magazine</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9e0e10cf737181747a5851931431c5b4217faa04\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9e0e10cf737181747a5851931431c5b4217faa04/0_0_4676_3104/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Tour de Yorkshire rides past Beverley Minster.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"664\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Tour de Yorkshire rides past Beverley Minster.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bryn Lennon/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u2022 <strong>Drink</strong><br>The White Horse (22 Hengate), known as <strong>Nellie\u2019s</strong>, after an elderly barmaid, is a warren of stone-floored rooms with gaslights, lumpy seats, open fires and local characters sipping pints of Sam Smith\u2019s mild.</p> <p>\u2022 <strong>Culture</strong><br>Walk from the Minster on the south side of town (begun in 1220 AD) and head through the Georgian Quarter to <strong>Saint Mary\u2019s</strong> church and the <strong>North Bar</strong>, Britain\u2019s only surviving brick-built town gate.

  "<h2><strong>Collect seedheads</strong></h2> <p>Don\u2019t be too hasty to tidy up the garden: leaving browning plant stems standing over winter provides vital habitats for wildlife. But keep an eye out for the particularly attractive seedheads of poppies, alliums, nigella, agapanthus, teasels and the like. Cut these, keeping long stems intact, place them inside a paper bag and hang upside down somewhere airy indoors to dry. Any ripe seeds should fall into the bag and can be set aside for sowing. Once bone dry, arrange the seedheads in a vase or put them aside to be sprayed silver or gold come Christmas.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"25a5e721ce4521511c6bea7d748b469de584b8a1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/25a5e721ce4521511c6bea7d748b469de584b8a1/0_912_2989_1794/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Collect attractive seedheads.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Collect attractive seedheads.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Likewise, leave the leaves: most of us can only dream of owning ranks of chicken wire cages for collecting autumn leaves to make into leaf mould. In the real world, leaves that fall on flowerbeds can be left in situ; they\u2019ll break down quickly enough and be incorporated into the soil by worms. Leaves on lawns can be raked on to beds, or run over with a mower, which not only collects them effortlessly, it also kickstarts decomposition. Add the blitzed leaves to beds as a mulch, add them to compost heaps or place in plastic sacks punctured with a few holes and stuffed somewhere out of the way for a year or two until they turn into leaf mould.</p> <p>If your compost heap is overflowing, it\u2019s time to harvest some \u201cblack gold\u201d. I shovel the un-rotted top layer into a rubble sack until I reach compost that\u2019s dark, crumbly and mostly free of worms (a sure sign compost is ready). The finished product goes on to flower and veg beds as a mulch and top-dresses shrubs and herbs in pots. And the contents of the rubble sack? This goes back in the composter in layers a few centimetres thick, consisting of grass cuttings, kitchen waste, leaves and other autumn debris. Invest in a <a href=\"http://www.garden-gear.co.uk/garden-hand-tools/gadgets/darlac-compost-aerator.htm\">Darlac compost aerator</a> (\u00a314 from Garden Gear). Use it regularly and you\u2019ll find the heap goes down much more quickly.</p> <h2><strong>Divide perennials</strong></h2> <p>A few years after putting it in the ground you may find your favourite plant is starting to look lacklustre; good growth on the outer edges of the clump, but dying off in the middle. Hostas, day lilies, astrantias, hardy geraniums, sedums and many other clump-forming hardy perennials can be divided now to reinvigorate the plants, and make more for other parts of the garden. Dig up the root ball of the plant, shake off excess soil and lay it out on a piece of plastic sheeting for some surgery \u2013 some can be unravelled by hand while others will need back-to-back forks or even a pruning saw to prise them apart. (While you\u2019re at it, check for and squish <a href=\"https://www.rhs.org.uk/advice/profile?PID=234\">vine weevil</a>; small white C-shaped grubs that feast on plant roots.) Each newly formed clump should have a few healthy-looking roots and shoots. You can either replant them in the garden or pot up to pass on to a gardening friend. Keep them well watered until established.</p> <h2><strong>Spruce up garden furniture</strong></h2> <p>Wooden and metal furniture can start to look pretty ropey after a few seasons of British weather. But a splash of colour can transform it, and protect it through the winter months \u2013 particularly useful if you don\u2019t have anywhere to store it under cover. <a href=\"https://www.cuprinol.co.uk/products/garden_shades.jsp\">Cuprinol garden shades</a> can be used on all exterior wood; <a href=\"http://ronseal.co.uk/garden/colour/garden-paint/\">Ronseal garden paint</a> works on wood, brick, terracotta and metal.

  "<p>The first person to spot a clown, the patient zero in the current <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/31/us/creepy-clown-sightings-in-south-carolina-cause-a-frenzy.html\">epidemic</a> of threatening clowns sightings spreading across the US, was a little boy at a low-income apartment complex in Greenville, South Carolina.<br></p> <p>He ran to his mother, Donna Arnold, and told her what he had seen: two clowns in the woods, both brightly dressed and made up. One with a red fright wig and the other with a black star painted on his face. They whispered something to the boy. </p> <p>\u201cThey were trying to lure him to the house,\u201d his mother told me, pointing toward the woods.</p> <p>A path into the woods led down into a shaded hollow, at the bottom of which was a small pond. Beside it sat a house that seemed abandoned. Someone had boarded up the windows, and the balcony sagged. New bags of potting soil sat near the basement door, though. And a modern security system looked recently installed.</p> <p>After sunset a car approached the house; a gleaming white, new-model Mercedes that looked as out of place as any clown car. The driver stepped out and said she had recently bought the old house as an investment because it sits on five acres in an otherwise densely populated area. \u201cYou think it looks bad now, you should have seen it before I came in,\u201d she said.</p> <p>While we talked she wore an in-ear headset, so it wasn\u2019t always clear whether she was speaking to me or someone on her phone. </p> <p>No, she didn\u2019t want to give her name, she said. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed element--supporting\" data-alt=\"Scary clown sightings are getting out of hand\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.facebook.com/plugins/video.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Ftheguardian%2Fvideos%2F571461509708283%2F&show_text=0&width=400\" width=\"400\" height=\"400\" style=\u201dmax-width:400px;max-height:400px\u201d frameborder=\"0\" allowTransparency=\"true\" allowFullScreen=\"true\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>Yes, she had heard about the clown sightings. </p> <p>She gestured toward the apartment complex through the trees. \u201cEvery one of them has a phone, and can work it better than I can,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd yet there\u2019s not a single video of a clown?\u201d</p> <p>I followed the path back to deliver the good news to Donna Arnold. The clowns weren\u2019t real. </p> <p>\u201cHa!\u201d she said. One sharp stab of laughter. \u201cCome around to the back.\u201d</p> <p>Her apartment backed up to the same patch of overgrown woods where the clowns had appeared. Arnold pointed to a dented spot in her door where the paint had recently been chipped away. \u201cThe clowns hit it with a chain,\u201d she said, with complete conviction. \u201cI saw them. They hit it and ran off into the woods just as I came out. They\u2019re trying to scare us.\u201d</p> <p>From this patch of woods, the word of prowling clowns began to spread. On the other side of Greenville, first. Then down in South Carolina\u2019s low country. Then North Carolina. Florida. Kentucky. Beyond the south to Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, New York. </p> <p>And, finally, my little girl\u2019s school. </p> <h2>\u2022\u2022\u2022</h2> <p>Nobody laughs at clowns any more.</p> <p>Maybe antiquated proto-clowns did make people smile. But the legendary Chinese jester Yu Sze and the imperial Roman<em> stupidus </em>would be unrecognizable to us today. </p> <p>The first clown who fits our description \u2013 painted face, frilly collar \u2013 was Joseph Grimaldi, who entertained Londoners in the 19th century but had a decidedly dark side. \u201cI am Grim-all-day,\u201d he told people.</p> <p>A young Charles Dickens ghost-wrote Grimaldi\u2019s memoirs, a saga of abuse, addiction and agony. \u201cA tale of unmitigated suffering, even when that suffering be mental, possesses but few attractions for the reader; but when, as in this case, a large portion of it is physical,\u201d Dickens wrote, it \u201cgrows absolutely distasteful\u201d.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Clowns hold up a mirror on society \u2026 to be afraid of them is ultimately to be afraid of yourself</p> <footer> <cite>David Kiser, Ringling Bros</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Dickens recognized, even with the very first modern clown, that what fascinates us is not the exaggerated painted face, or the dull face of a man underneath. It\u2019s the tension between the two. The dissonance between what is and what appears to be. </p> <p>That conflict plucks at some ancient strand of human genetic code. </p> <p>\u201cSince caveman days, people would smear ashes on their faces to make each other laugh,\u201d said David Kiser, a talent recruiter for Ringling Bros circus company. \u201cOther times they would smear ashes on their faces to scare each other.\u201d</p> <h2>\u2022\u2022\u2022</h2> <p>I recently received an automated call from my daughter\u2019s school, in Fairhope, Alabama. It was intended to calm parents, but the missing details spoke more sharply than the ones included.</p> <p>\u201cHi, this is Fairhope middle school calling with an important message,\u201d the cheerful voice began. \u201cPlease rest assured that your students are safe and the school is taking necessary precautions due to rumored activity.

YOU are from the Pits of Hell!\u201d a local woman wrote on Flomo\u2019s page. \u201cEveryone let us pray as believers over this act of evil against us.\u201d She immediately followed through by writing a lengthy, heartfelt, terrified Facebook prayer.</p> <p>Some people appealed to heaven. Some speculated on the best ammunition to bring down a clown. Some advocated restraint \u2013 maybe just paint balls? \u2013 and others reached for .45-caliber pistols.</p> <p>All of it might seem silly but something about the arched eyebrows and garish smile skipped a signal right to the base of people\u2019s brains. </p> <p>They had lost all capacity for critical thought.</p> <h2>\u2022\u2022\u2022</h2> <p>People in Flomaton don\u2019t go in for subtext. Their town sits on the Florida-Alabama state line, so they named it after \u201cFlorida\u201d and \u201cAlabama\u201d and \u201ctown\u201d.</p> <p>Long ago it served as a railroad hub for timber, but its population has since dwindled to 1,400 people who work at Flomaton high school, Wadkins autos or the old train museum. People are polite. Most attend one of several churches.

Police in Virginia arrested two teens for wearing clown outfits and chasing children. Meanwhile police in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, arrested a man for falsely claiming he had seen a clown trying to lure children and chased it into the woods.

  "<p>Inevitably the NHS reform drive got caught up in the party conference crossfire. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/diane-abbott\">Diane Abbott</a>, in her last few days as shadow health secretary, attempted to rebrand sustainability and transformation plans (STPs) as \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/27/labour-save-nhs-privatisation-cuts\">secret Tory plans</a>\u201d, while prime minister Theresa May made the ludicrous assertion that the government had given the NHS \u201cmore than its leaders asked for\u201d, conjuring up an image of NHS England trying to work out what to do with all the extra cash.</p> <p>But clinicians as well as politicians are becoming increasingly vocal on the current round of reform. The Royal College of GPs is getting angry over the obsessive focus on sorting out hospital deficits rather than transforming care. At their <a href=\"http://www.rcgpac.org.uk/\">annual conference</a> this week, college chair Maureen Baker accurately pointed out that if there is insufficient investment in general practice, system transformation simply won\u2019t happen, and the whole process will have been in vain.</p> <p>NHS England has expressed concern about the lack of clinical involvement in drawing up local plans. At the recent NHS Expo, chief nursing officer Professor Jane Cummings revealed that she had had \u201c<a href=\"http://www.nationalhealthexecutive.com/Interviews/nurses-must-have-day-in-day-out-involvement-in-stps-\">mixed responses</a>\u201d when pushing for nurses to have a greater role in STPs, and urged healthcare professionals to make their voices heard.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/healthcare-network/2016/sep/15/health-care-deliver-changes-keep-public-on-side\">Can health and care deliver changes and keep the public on side?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The RCN backs the drive for patients to increasingly manage their own care, but <a href=\"https://www.rcn.org.uk/news-and-events/news/nhs-finances-at-risk-of-further-cuts\">has warned</a> that the only way to do that effectively is to listen to patients and clinicians. In many areas this did not happen before the plans were submitted to NHS England.</p> <p>The extraordinary speed with which the plans are being put together is causing concern. Last week Julia Simon, who has just finished as the head of commissioning policy at NHS England, went so far as <a href=\"http://www.gponline.com/shameful-pace-stp-rollout-risks-financial-meltdown-warns-former-nhs-commissioning-chief/article/1410546\">to claim</a> there were \u201ca lot of lies in the system about the \u2026 benefits that will be delivered; it\u2019s just a construct, not a reality\u201d. She described the speed as \u201cmad\u201d and \u201cshameful\u201d.</p> <p>NHS England is rushing the process for a reason. As NHS Improvement chief executive Jim Mackey made clear from his first days in the job, it would be a calamitous failure for the NHS to push the Department of Health over its parliamentary spending limit. The possible consequences are far greater than simply NHS England chief executive Simon Stevens losing his job; it could lead to a fundamental change in the relationship between frontline health services and government.</p> <p>Despite Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt\u2019s determination to keep a personal grip on the health service, and despite the numerous weaknesses in the current structure, the NHS does at least have a meaningful degree of autonomy from direct Whitehall control. Busting the spending limit runs the serious risk that this would be reversed, to the detriment of the whole system.</p> <p>But NHS England and NHS improvement need to balance the need for quick action to stabilise the finances with acceptance that the only way to deliver the transformation they seek is for it to be led by clinicians as much as managers.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/healthcare-network/2016/sep/09/lethal-combination-secrecy-jargon-overshadowed-nhs-plans\">A lethal combination of secrecy and jargon has overshadowed NHS plans</a> </p> </aside>  <p>STPs are focused on structures and process, but as thousands of pages of visions and plans that have come to little over the years demonstrate, documents like these are ultimately worthless without clinical buy-in and leadership, because they all depend on clinicians taking different decisions with their patients on the best way forward.</p> <p>The frenetic pace of the STP process gives the erroneous impression that, at least for the most advanced areas, it will all be over by Christmas. In reality, this is just the beginning of many years of work to change the culture of the entire health and care system.</p> <p>Once the immediate panic over getting financial plans in place has subsided, the NHS leadership needs to focus relentlessly on giving staff a powerful voice in system change. Clinicians need to be empowered and supported in making the improvements that they know are needed, while also being challenged to develop their thinking around crucial areas such as building services around the needs of the patients rather than the institution. </p> <p>Either clinicians start to lead this, or it will fail.</p> <p><strong><a href=\"https://register.theguardian.com/healthcare-professionals/?CMP=dis-166\">Join the Healthcare Professionals Network</a> to read more pieces like this.

  "<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/karl-lagerfeld\" title=\"\">Karl Lagerfeld</a> is a man who has found fame and fortune because he is very good at providing wealthy women with clothing and accessories that proclaim their wealth. So why on earth does he feel he can tell a wealthy woman with clothing and accessories that proclaim her wealth <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/10/04/karl-lagerfeld-kim-kardashian-cannot-display-wealth-then-be-surp/\" title=\"\">that it was her own silly fault she found herself tied up and dumped in a bath</a> while armed robbers divested her of her jewellery?</p> <p>Lagerfeld, the chief designer at Chanel, Fendi and his own label, declares that \u201cyou cannot display your wealth then be surprised\u201d when you are robbed. So that\u2019s him out of three jobs. Perhaps he can become an armed robber himself. I\u2019ve always felt that you can\u2019t be an armed robber then be surprised when everyone thinks you\u2019re the scum of the earth. I\u2019m clearly out of kilter with the spirit of the times, which seems united in its belief that it\u2019s OK for five armed robbers to like diamonds, but not for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/kim-kardashian\" title=\"\">Kim Kardashian</a> to. What next? Will people start believing that a woman in a short skirt is asking to be raped?</p> <p>Kardashian, however, appears to agree with her critics. She is said to have accepted that it <em>was</em> foolish to flaunt her&#xa0;lifestyle in the media, especially social media. Except, isn\u2019t a lot of Kardashian\u2019s wealth actually the consequence of her willingness to flaunt it in the media, especially social media? The essential view is that folk such as Kardashian are going to attract psychopathic attention, and she\u2019s an idiot for getting all freaked out because one part of her job turns out to be a bit less pleasant than other parts of her job. Who do we think these guys are? Gentlemen highwaymen?</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>A political party that insists refugees should be driven out, not helped, has set Britain against its neighbours</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>I hold no brief for Kim Kardashian, nor for the people who sustain her by consuming the media in which she so lucratively appears. I don\u2019t, however, believe that Lagerfeld\u2019s version of the same deal is so very much more elevated. In his more established iteration of the same formula, the respectful masses admire the Chanel suits in Vogue, and feel they own their own small fragment of the specialness in the form of a Chanel eye pencil.</p> <p>The key word here is \u201crespect\u201d. Kardashian has notoriety, rather than fame. She attracts contempt rather than admiration. She is vulnerable because everyone knows who she is, and no one actually respects her. Those who respect her so little that they hold a gun to her head, terrify her, leave her in fear for her life: they have more in common with the Lagerfelds of this world than Kardashian and her fans do. (Those who do respect Kardashian are widely considered to be as ghastly as she is.)</p> <p>The chilling thing about Kardashian\u2019s violation, and the world\u2019s reaction to it,&#xa0;is that it affords her no respect at all, not even respect for another human being who was subjected to an awful ordeal. Worse, not only is there no respect. There\u2019s not even any kindness. On the contrary, there\u2019s a note of arrogant pride in the gusto with which lack of empathy for Kardashian\u2019s suffering is vocalised.</p> <p>I guess this wouldn\u2019t be so important if it were confined to wealthy self-advertisers living their weird and ill-advised dream and getting robbed for their pains. But it\u2019s not. A narcissistic bully is admired so much that he\u2019s within spitting distance of being president of the US. A political party that insists refugees should be driven out, not helped, has achieved its fantasy of setting Britain against its neighbours. The bullies who blame and denigrate are in the ascendancy, and people seem to like it. I don\u2019t think any of this bodes well for the political and social future of humanity.</p> <p>But the most distressing thing is to consider how this adult revelling in lack of empathy might be affecting our children. There are a whole bunch of reasons why suicides among children have now reached a 17-year high, not least the political and institutional lack of kindness that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/jul/04/nhs-child-mental-health-services-anxiety-depression\" title=\"\">starves children\u2019s mental health services of resources</a>.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/oct/01/cyberbullying-what-if-its-your-child-at-fault\">Cyberbullying \u2013 what if it\u2019s your child at fault?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It\u2019s easy to blame social media, but it\u2019s easy to make a connection too.

Despite all his tweeting, he seems cut off from modern life. In 1902, the unpleasant English satirist TWH Crosland wrote that \u201cHoo are ye the noo?\u201d was the conventional greeting in newspaper offices, Scots figuring disproportionately in a profession \u201cinto which you can crawl without inquiry as to your qualifications, and \u2026 in which the most middling talent will take you a long way\u201d. But the Scottish domination of London journalism ended long ago, even before the disappearance of blue pencils and copy boys.

What persists still, in Scotland as a diminished fact and elsewhere as a pejorative, is the tenement.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d633ee123e424b8e21a93192aa07f19c23cf6a08\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d633ee123e424b8e21a93192aa07f19c23cf6a08/0_506_3614_2169/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A tenement block in the Gorbals before demolition in the early 60s.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A tenement block in the Gorbals before demolition in the early 60s.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Albert McCabe/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The word comes from the medieval Latin <em>tenementum,</em> meaning a property held by tenure; a house divided into separate, rented homes became known a tenement house. In the walled cities of medieval France and Italy, separate dwellings arranged over several floors of the same building were a vertical solution to the problem of limited space. Edinburgh built some spectacular examples in the 17th century \u2013 at 12 storeys, they were among the tallest buildings in Europe \u2013 but it was Victorian Glasgow that made them its own. Tenements became the defining feature of the townscape, shaping the nature of the city and the lives of the people in it more than any other single&#xa0;factor, diet apart.</p> <p>They had a modest start, arriving with Glasgow\u2019s first manufacturing industry, cotton, as brick-built barracks for mill workers, but landlords were quick to adopt their basic form \u2013 two or more storeys divided into flats, reached by a common entrance or close and a common stair \u2013 as the easiest solution to the housing needs of the thousands of migrants who moved to the city from Ireland and the Highlands to find jobs in shipyards and engineering works. Glasgow\u2019s population was <a href=\"http://www.understandingglasgow.com/indicators/population/trends/historic_population_trend\" title=\"\">77,000 in 1801 </a>and 762,000 a hundred years later; it had swollen by a factor of 10. Families crowded into apartments of one room (\u201cthe single end\u201d) or two (\u201cthe room-and-kitchen\u201d), which were the two most common types of accommodation.</p> <p>Between 1872 and 1876, boom years for the Glasgow economy, the city authorised the building of more than 21,000 tenement houses. Long canyons of four-storey terraces created new working-class suburbs of yellow sandstone that were soon turned black by factory and household smoke. This was the period that created what you might call \u201cpeak Glasgow\u201d \u2013 the Glasgow of popular memory and imagination that suffered little wartime damage to its fabric and lasted more or less unchanged until the last tram ran in the 1960s. But in all that time the tenement\u2019s reputation had grown more soiled and squalid, so that there was little opposition when plans were made for the demolition of entire neighbourhoods to make way for tower blocks and a motorway.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"19c4a30889b7d44a204a018f09636afa3e7270db\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/19c4a30889b7d44a204a018f09636afa3e7270db/28_265_4052_2431/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Victorian tenements in Edinburgh\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Victorian tenements in Edinburgh.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Murdo Macleod/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The reputation was in part unfair. Many solid and spacious homes had been built on the tenement principle until, in 1910, new legislation bit into the profits from building them. There was an informal league table of desirable tenement types. At the top stood those built of red sandstone with decorative tiles in their closes and grass flourishing in their backyards, and at the bottom those with blackened yellow stone and an infrequently whitewashed close.There were several gradations in between, but below them all lay the abyss of single ends and room-and-kitchens, with their curtained-off beds and communal WCs accessed from the common stair.</p> <p>Externally, even these tenements could have a kind of nobility: according to the architectural historian <a href=\"http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/12697499.Frank_Worsdall/\" title=\"\">Frank Worsdall</a>, the inspiration for many early tenement elevations lay in the Renaissance palaces of Rome and northern Italy. But even the Corinthian pilasters of the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palazzo_della_Cancelleria\" title=\"\">Palazzo della Cancelleria</a> could scarcely compensate for the poor health, disease and early death that came with bad sanitation and a 14ft by 12ft room that catered for the waking and sleeping needs of a family of six.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Even the Corinthian pilasters couldn't compensate for the poor health, disease and death that came with bad sanitation</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>By the mid-19th century, bad housing had become Scotland\u2019s most notorious social problem: two thirds of the population lived in homes of not more than two rooms and many one-room homes had no access to natural light. England did better. The <a href=\"http://www.ukcensusonline.com/census/1911.php\" title=\"\">census of 1911</a> showed that 45% of Scots lived at a density of more than two people per room, while the figure in England was only 9%. Two thirds of Glasgow\u2019s population lived in one or two rooms, but only a third of London\u2019s.</p> <p>Come the Bolshevik revolution, this had consequences. Outbreaks of popular unrest in Glasgow \u2013 \u201cthe red Clyde\u201d \u2013 made Britain and America anxious about the future. According to the writer <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Bolitho_Ryall\" title=\"\">William Bolitho</a>, sent on assignment to Glasgow in 1924 by <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/topic/New-York-World\" title=\"\">New York World</a>, \u201cthe smouldering danger \u2026 had ceased to be a local anxiety, and become an interest and alarm to the whole civilised world\u201d. There was \u201csomething deeply wrong with the Clyde; the whole middle-class of England knows it, though hardly in detail\u201d. What was this wrong thing? Bolitho decided that the root grievance was housing \u2026 \u201ca simple term for a cancerous condition which, starting from the lack of space and light in the homes of the workers \u2026 has developed into a political movement, quite apart from Marxianism [sic], which threatens to harden into almost as rigorous an extremism as Leninism itself\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/oct/06/hard-brexit-could-see-scotland-lose-80000-jobs-and-cost-2000-a-head\">Hard Brexit could cost Scotland \u00a32,000 a head and 80,000 jobs</a> </p> </aside>  <p>As it turned out, the tenement\u2019s legacy was less straightforward. It began to feature in newspapers as the home of the criminal rather than the political. In No Mean City, the notorious 1935 novel about razor gangs, the action moves in and out of decrepit Gorbals tenements. The protagonist\u2019s family of 11 shares a room and kitchen, and in the opening scene he rises from his cavity bed to have a pee in the kitchen sink. Before the novel appeared, the Gorbals was unknown beyond Glasgow. After it, the Gorbals and Glasgow were synonymous.</p> <p>\u201cBorn in a tenement in Gorbals Cross&#xa0;/ Of all the teddy boys he was the&#xa0;boss,\u201d we sang in 1956 to the tune of&#xa0;Davy Crockett. To those who knew no better, the word had come to mean slum \u2013 a meaning that Cleese expanded to include the suggestion that&#xa0;ignorance&#xa0;and servility were common in the Scottish population as a whole, not excluding the Spectator\u2019s editor, who grew up in the tenement-free Highlands and went, like Cleese, to&#xa0;a private school.</p> <p>But we know who the ignorant one is in this case. Long ago \u2013 perhaps it was the same year as Davy Crockett \u2013 I woke up in a tenement for the first time. I lay in the recess bed in the kitchen and watched the activity around me. A fire was already burning in what my aunt called \u201cthe range\u201d, a large and complicated piece of black ironwork with hinged doors and hotplates. My uncle was getting ready to leave for work. My aunt and two cousins sat at the kitchen table drinking tea and eating morning rolls. Sun streamed through the window. Looking back at this scene, I conclude that the tenement\u2019s reputation has been badly traduced, but&#xa0;of course not included in the picture&#xa0;but invaluably there just out of shot are a sitting room, two bedrooms and a long narrow bathroom \u2013 here was&#xa0;a tenement fit for a king.</p>",
  "<p>A number of competing bars have been built into the outer bulwark of the National Theatre in London, and when she emerges from rehearsals one night in September the Australian actor <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/elizabeth-debicki\">Elizabeth Debicki</a> \u2013 animated, adamant, 6ft 3in \u2013 hesitates. Which bar? We circle the building together, scouting options, dismissing one place for being too quiet, another too busy.

She chews gum and fiddles constantly with her short, bleached hair, now tugging it upright, now flattening it sideways. Her exuberance might be amplified by the fact that she\u2019s only just been let loose from a rehearsal room after nine hours\u2019 work on a new play, but Debicki says she\u2019s always had \u201can ingrained intensity, a little bit of madness\u201d, and she puts this down to her ancestry: Polish on her father\u2019s side, Irish on her mother\u2019s. When I ask about the most tiring part of rehearsing, Debicki flattens her hair to one side and says, \u201cIt\u2019s a David Hare play.

I ask if she can give me a little preview of her New England accent. \u201cNo. Noooo. No way.\u201d The hair gets dragged into clown-like puffs. \u201c<em>No</em>.\u201d Debicki has signed a number of non-disclosure agreements recently, she explains, mostly related to her work on Guardians Of The Galaxy, and this has made her paranoid about saying anything about anything. \u201cYou start to worry there are snipers on the tops of nearby buildings.\u201d</p> <p>We talk instead about The Night Manager, safely in the can, safely broadcast, safely praised and garlanded. Overnight, while Debicki was asleep in her rented place in London, many of the cast and crew came together in Los Angeles.

Over its six episodes, there was a good deal of betrayal and sex and murder, as well as a lot of checking in and out of swanky hotels. There were clunky moments (Debicki\u2019s character to Hiddleston\u2019s: \u201cEveryone\u2019s attracted to you: <em>who are you</em>?\u201d), but even so it became that show \u2013 the one you\u2019d better watch, as a matter of national imperative, in order not to be left out of conversations the whole time.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I love the idea that everyone was sitting down on a couch in front of it on a Sunday</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cI love the idea that everyone was sitting down on a couch in front of it on a Sunday,\u201d Debicki says. \u201cThat\u2019s old-fashioned entertainment, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Her commutes to and from the theatre have been interesting, post-Night Manager.

On the set of The Night Manager, \u201cwe used to fight a lot about how sexy Jed had to be\u201d; Debicki thought less, Bier thought more. A shower scene from episode two had to be tried a few times because, as Debicki remembers, \u201cSusanne thought I was drying myself off like a football player in a locker room. She wanted Jed to be, not an object, but very feminine.\u201d Bier helped her to understand the difference.</p> <p>Most importantly, Debicki says, she responded to Bier\u2019s refusal to praise her just for showing up. \u201cSometimes you work with directors who are very vocal, very complimentary. And I probably looked to Susanne for that, at first, like a deer in the headlights.\u201d What happened? Debicki does an impersonation of the way the director spoke to her \u2013 eyes rolling, Scandinavian accent set to full-stun sarcasm: \u201cYou\u2019re <em>wonderful</em>, you\u2019re <em>amazing</em>, you\u2019re the <em>best</em> actress in the <em>world</em>.\u2019\u201d She grimaces and mangles her hair. \u201cIt was freeing, to be made terrible fun of. I stopped looking for her approval.\u201d</p> <p>Debicki was born in France, the oldest of three children. Her parents were ballet dancers who met in Paris while performing in a show together. They relocated to the suburbs of Melbourne when Debicki was five. At her new school, \u201cI remember desperately wanting to assimilate. It was probably the beginning of my acting career.\u201d She spoke fluent French. \u201cBut kids are sensitive, right? I decided I wanted to fit in and I wouldn\u2019t speak the language any more. My parents were appalled. Can you imagine?

When her parents\u2019 dancing careers timed out, Debicki\u2019s father took a job working backstage at a theatre. She remembers \u201cit was all a big relief\u201d when she won a scholarship to an otherwise pricey school. Somewhere under Debicki\u2019s quippy top layer there\u2019s something firmer, and I get a sense of this when I ask an incautious question about how she won her scholarship: a recital, a dance? \u201cSat an exam,\u201d she says, flatly. \u201cI can write, too.\u201d Debicki explains: \u201cWhen your parents are ballet dancers, they teach you to be really fucking tough.\u201d Physically? \u201cThey deal with a lot of physical pain, but no. Dancers are the toughest people I\u2019ve met on a psychological level. It is so much more brutal than acting. Your expiration date is more definite, you work so much harder for your place along that barre or in that chorus line or whatever. My parents \u2013 who were very good at what they did, and had a sneaking suspicion early on that they were going to raise at least one child who would turn out to be a thespian \u2013 they really instilled a lot of toughness in us.\u201d She remembers being told, often: chin up.</p> <p>But she ever so slightly broke their hearts, Debicki says, when at the age of 17 she got into law school (\u201cThey were overjoyed\u201d) and chose instead to take up a place to study drama. At the University of Melbourne, Debicki\u2019s training was almost exclusively theatrical. \u201cWe had one week of film and TV classes. I remember having to hold up fake bottles and say: \u2018Buy this Coke!\u2019 I never expected to work on screen.\u201d Her first job as a graduate was on the stage, playing a bereaved mother in a drama with <a href=\"http://www.mtc.com.au\">the Melbourne Theatre Company</a>: \u201cI had to cry a lot.\u201d</p> <p>This was an odd time in her life. Just as the weepy play was about to start rehearsing, Debicki went to a screen test in a Melbourne hotel, where an agent was assembling tapes of unknown Australian actors for <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0525303/bio?ref_=nm_ov_bio_sm\">Baz Luhrmann\u2019s</a> perusal, on the off-chance the director might want them in his new adaptation of The Great Gatsby. Debicki\u2019s tape caught Luhrmann\u2019s eye. \u201cI got an email that said, \u2018Baz liked your test.\u2019 It was incomprehensible.\u201d She was flown to Los Angeles, a 36-hour trip, where she did another test. Back in Melbourne, she didn\u2019t hear anything for a month. \u201cI started to assume I\u2019d been hit by a bus and dreamed the whole thing.\u201d Then she was walking to rehearsals one day when Luhrmann called her mobile and said, \u201cWould you like to be part of our little play?\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>People often say I seem very confident. I wonder if it\u2019s from having been different from a young age</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>In Gatsby, which was filmed in Sydney in late 2011, Debicki played Jordan Baker, a glamorous society cynic, vaguely catalytic in the doomed affair between <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/leonardodicaprio\">Leonardo DiCaprio</a>\u2019s Jay Gatsby and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/carey-mulligan\">Carey Mulligan</a>\u2019s Daisy Buchanan. Of her state of mind during the shoot, Debicki says, \u201cI had just finished school. I felt about 12 years old.\u201d She was good in the movie, though: lofty, composed, holding her own as the notably unfamous one in a cast composed of established or rising stars. Debicki knows that Luhrmann (\u201cmy fairy godmother\u201d) took a chance on her. \u201cHe casts on instinct. And I guess with this he decided, \u2018I have big actors in it already.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>She was working in another play by the time Gatsby premiered at Cannes in 2013. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/australia-culture-blog/2013/jun/09/the-maids-review-stc-blanchett\">The Maids</a>, starring <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/cate-blanchett\">Cate Blanchett</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/isabelle-huppert\">Isabelle Huppert</a>, had Debicki as a wealthy woman who visits her frustrations on her servants. After a run in Melbourne, the play transferred to Broadway, where Debicki was singled out for praise (<a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/10/theater/cate-blanchett-and-isabelle-huppert-in-the-maids.html?_r=0\">the New York Times called her \u201csmashing\u201d</a>; <a href=\"http://time.com/3111617/the-maids-review-cate-blanchett/\">Time magazine found her \u201ctall and delicious\u201d</a>).

She leans forward and seizes my knee: \u201cThere is probably someone from Marvel \u2013 wearing a tweed cap \u2013 pretending to be an audience member at the National \u2013 spying on me <em>right now</em>.\u201d</p> <p>She adopts a roughly similar policy of banterish deflection when prodded, mildly, to talk about her romantic life. \u201cHave I got a boyfriend-slash-girlfriend? That\u2019s very liberal of you. I don\u2019t want to say anything. I\u2019m really private.\u201d What she will say is that it can be unnerving, hopping from job to job, rental to rental, and that she\u2019s glad her parents trained her in the tradition of iron, ballet-dancer toughness. \u201cAs an actor, you\u2019re nomadic. You never settle. And that can be very trying on the sense of self, when who you feel you are shifts all the time. It drove me nuts as a kid, all that \u2018Chin up\u2019 stuff, but now I\u2019m grateful for it.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fd8e2796679ea32859f9c5a661b078869a498a28\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fd8e2796679ea32859f9c5a661b078869a498a28/10_70_3281_4101/800.jpg\" alt=\"Elizabeth Debicki\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jacket, by Valentino, from harrods.com.

On the set of The Night Manager, she\u2019s reminded, Hiddleston used to quiz her about the meaning of Australian slang words such as \u201cdag\u201d and \u201cdaggy\u201d; she points a thumb at her backpack, a cumbersome, canvas thing: \u201cThis is daggy.\u201d</p> <p>We set off together, heading for the same station. Like Debicki, I\u2019m tall (I have a couple of inches on her 6ft 3in) and we probably make a bit of a sight, striding along the river. Oncomers take a good look, then look away. I know from experience that it\u2019s hard, if not impossible, to engage someone in interesting conversation about being tall, though every day people try. I\u2019m not eager to bring up the subject unless she does.</p> <p>\u201cI can\u2019t remember the last time I met someone who was taller than me,\u201d she says.</p> <p>We compare notes. Has she had that one where an old lady in the supermarket asks for something off the top shelf? (Yes.) The one where an overwhelmed young child bursts out crying, spontaneously, at the sight of her? (Not yet.) Debicki says she\u2019s come to think her height might be the source of some of her unusual energy. \u201cPeople often say I seem very confident. If I have to present an award, or it\u2019s the first day of work somewhere, I have this veneer of being totally au fait. I wonder if it\u2019s from having been different from a young age. I was always aware that people were aware of me. Maybe I tried to overcompensate.\u201d</p> <p>She\u2019s too sarky and self-aware not to point out, while saying this, that nobody is about to start \u201cplaying the violin\u201d for a \u201ctall-y\u201d. And she can hardly blame strangers for being attentive to physical distinction, because \u201crare\u2019s rare, you know?\u201d Even so, height is something you don\u2019t get any choice about and can\u2019t switch off; it\u2019s a strange and unrepresentative thing to be defined by. So don\u2019t make the whole article about me being tall, Debicki suggests, before we shake hands goodbye. I tell her I\u2019ll put it in somewhere at the end.</p> <p>\u2022 <a href=\"https://www.nationaltheatre.org.uk/shows/red-barn\">The Red Barn</a> is at the Lyttelton Theatre, London SE1, until 17 January</p> <p>\u2022 Styling: Melanie Wilkinson.

  "<p>The bright yellow <a href=\"https://thebiglemon.com/\">Big Lemon</a> buses are a familiar sight \u2013 and smell \u2013 on the roads of Brighton and Hove. For nine years the Community Interest Company has run all its vehicles on waste cooking oil from local restaurants, recycled into biodiesel, but now it wants to go one step further.</p> <p>The Big Lemon wants to install solar panels on the roof of its east Brighton depot, storing the energy in batteries and charging buses overnight. It is working with the <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.brightonenergy.org.uk/\">Brighton Energy Cooperative</a> (BEC) towards a vision of zero emissions bus services in every UK community by 2030, using Brighton as a pilot.</p> <p>The Big Lemon eventually wants to replace its 10 biodiesel buses, which are not suitable for conversion, and has already raised \u00a3250,000 of investment in a bond issue to do this, exceeding the original target of \u00a3100,000.</p> <p>The company has also been shortlisted for the <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.mandsenergyfund.com/\">M&amp;S Energy Community Energy Fund</a>, which could bring up to \u00a325,000 through a public vote and pledged donations from voters \u2013 the cost of the solar panel installation at the depot. The project is <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.mandsenergyfund.com/projects/the-big-lemon-solar-bus-project\">currently</a> leading votes in the south and more than \u00a39,490 has been pledged.</p> <h2>UK\u2019s first solar buses</h2> <p>Although this is the first UK initiative of its kind, there are examples of electric buses across the country, including in <a href=\"http://www.standard.co.uk/news/transport/first-electric-buses-in-central-london-by-end-of-year-as-two-routes-announced-a3341251.html\">London</a> and <a href=\"http://www.harrogateadvertiser.co.uk/news/business/harrogate-transport-to-be-transformed-with-new-greener-electric-bus-fleet-1-8039631\">Harrogate</a>. The government has put <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/government-awards-30-million-funding-for-cleaner-greener-bus-journeys\">\u00a330m</a> of funding towards helping bus operators and local authorities in England run more low-emission buses.</p> <p>\u201cElectric bus technology has progressed quite far. We wanted to try that and embrace it,\u201d says Tom Druitt, managing director of The Big Lemon. Biodiesel has a low carbon footprint but there are still emissions from the buses. Using electricity means almost no emissions.</p> <p>The key thing about The Big Lemon idea is that the energy will be generated on site. \u201cIf we run on mains electricity then we still have a large carbon footprint,\u201d says Druitt, who is also a Green party councillor.</p> <p>The Big Lemon has decided to convert diesel buses to run on electric, instead of buying brand new electric buses. Work has begun on the first buses which were purchased for \u00a320,000 each. With conversion costs of \u00a3140,000 each, Druitt says this approach is still cost effective as, depending on the brand, a new electric bus would cost between \u00a3250,000 and \u00a3500,000. Conversion also allows the company to have more say in the bus\u2019s specifications.</p> <p>Druitt estimates that The Big Lemon will save around \u00a320,000 a year in fuel costs, as well as a reduction in maintenance costs. \u201cWe\u2019ve estimated that there\u2019s a six-year payback on these buses and we\u2019re calculating for an eight-year life span, so essentially we get two years free,\u201d he explains.</p> <p>The panels for the initial project will generate 30,000kWh of electricity and will power the whole of the 52 route between Woodingdean and Brighton city centre. The Big Lemon wants to power all five of its routes this way eventually while its coach fleet, used for longer distances, will continue to use waste cooking oil due to a lack of available technology.</p> <h2>Can it be replicated?</h2> <p>How easy will this idea be to replicate elsewhere? Chris Jardine, technical director of solar energy experts <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.jojusolar.co.uk/\">Joju Solar</a>, says that in theory it should be easy. \u201cI think the intricacies will be in whether you can get enough energy from the solar to fully power the fleet,\u201d he says. \u201cIt may be easy in summer, while in the middle of winter you might be getting five times less electricity out of your solar panels.</p> <p>\u201cBy not putting it into the grid it makes it a bit more difficult as you come across this commonly found issue with renewables, that they\u2019re intermittent,\u201d says Will Cottrell, chairman of BEC. \u201cYou need to think quite hard about how it works technically,\u201d he adds, explaining that getting the right size battery and overall system is key to providing the right level of supply.</p> <p>\u201cBut this is the way it\u2019s got to be,\u201d he says. \u201cTo move us away from a centralised energy system we need to move away from a centralised grid as well, so we need to understand the technology that is going to enable us to do that.\u201d</p> <p>The plan for The Big Lemon is to produce enough energy in the winter, and an excess in summer but it will have a mains backup if needed. The team can then use any excess energy in the summer to give energy to the building. </p> <p>\u201cI think our independence, background and philosophy generally makes it easier for us to try these things,\u201d says Druitt. \u201cThat\u2019s what all our stakeholders signed up for really, we don\u2019t have an angry mob in an AGM.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Britain and the EU appear more bitterly divided over Brexit than at any time since the referendum, with European leaders ramping up their rhetoric after Theresa May signalled she would seek a clean break with the bloc.</p> <p>The prime minister\u2019s Conservative conference speech, in which she indicated Britain would prioritise immigration control and restore the primacy of UK law to become an \u201cindependent, sovereign nation\u201d without full access to the single market, drew a sharp response from continental capitals.</p> <p>In Paris, Fran\u00e7ois Hollande said Britain must suffer the consequences of its decision. \u201cThe UK has decided to do a Brexit.

won\u2019t be put under pressure constantly via European industry associations to eventually allow full access to the internal market even if all freedoms aren\u2019t respected,\u201d she said.</p> <p>The British government has yet to confirm what kind of future relationship it will seek with the EU, but the conditions set down in May\u2019s speech \u2013 in particular migration controls on EU citizens and the insistence that Britain will no longer be under the jurisdiction of the European court of justice \u2013 effectively rule out membership of the single market.</p> <p>That will be hard

the prime minister of Malta, which will hold the EU\u2019s rotating presidency when Britain triggers article 50 early next year, said the four freedoms \u2013 the movement of goods, capital, services

well-publicised divisions, the EU 27 have shown consistent unity on Brexit. Charles Grant of the Centre for European Reform thinktank <a href=\"https://www.cer.org.uk/insights/why-27-are-taking-hard-line-brexit\">said in a research paper last week </a>that this was partly because of a rising fear of Eurosceptic populism. </p> <p>\u201cA lot of British politicians believe that the hard line of the 27 is merely an opening stance,\u201d Grant said. \u201cRather more Britons assume that, in the end, Angela Merkel will look after the UK. But for Merkel, the interests of the EU come first. She believes that maintaining the institutional integrity of the EU, and the link between the four freedoms, is in Europe\u2019s interest and therefore Germany\u2019s.\u201d</p> <p>He said many British politicians were over-optimistic about the kind of deal they might achieve because they failed to understand the continental debate on migration. \u201cThey tend to assume that because the British dislike EU migration, other Europeans must think similarly,\u201d he said. </p> <p>\u201cIn most EU countries the big issue is inflows of people from outside, not inside the EU. In Germany, for example, mainstream politicians do not see intra-EU migration as a big problem. So the 27 are not going to allow the British to combine single-market membership with controls on EU migration.\u201d</p>",

  "<p>Rodrigo Duterte\u2019s first 100 days in office as president of the Philippines have been a busy time. With more than 16m votes in May\u2019s election, nearly 39% of the total vote and 6.6m more than his rival Mar Roxas, Duterte secured a landslide victory that saw him sworn into office a month later at the presidential residence, Malaca\u00f1ang<em> </em>Palace.</p> <p>Over the past three months he has followed through his election promise to tackle the drug trade in the country; a campaign that has seen <a href=\"http://time.com/4478954/philippines-rodrigo-duterte-drug-war-vigilante-killing-deaths/\">more than 2,400 people killed</a> and thousands more turn themselves in to the authorities.

Chili Sal, a 44-year-old banker living in Manila, thinks Duterte is unfit for the job. \u201cHe has and continues to exhibit appalling, unstatesmanlike behaviour when faced with criticisms of his policy in addressing the war on drugs. His blabbering blustering machismo attitude clearly shows he is inept.</p> <p>\u201cWhat is more worrying is his attitude that he is beyond reproach, thereby seemingly encouraging a somewhat culture of impunity amongst the ranks fighting his drug war for him.

Opening the gates in July, the agrarian reform secretary, Rafael Mariano, one of Duterte\u2019s cabinet ministers, said he hoped to <a href=\"http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/794277/no-more-dar-barricade-welded-gates-now-open\">break down walls</a>. \u201cThis symbolises that DAR, on all levels, will maintain open.

The <em>tanim bala</em> (bullet planting) scam saw staff insert bullets into the luggage of passengers as a means to extort them for money. Other developments have included a proposed <a href=\"http://www.rappler.com/nation/141831-bill-karaoke-sound-systems-ban\">nationwide ban on karaoke</a> sound systems after 10pm, the <a href=\"http://www.mb.com.ph/workplace-age-discrimination-bill-passed-in-senate/\">removal of age limit requirements for job seekers</a>, as well as the assurance that <a href=\"http://www.gov.ph/2016/09/29/duterte-assures-full-protection-of-ofws-from-abuses-%E2%80%A9%E2%80%A9/\">overseas Filipino workers (OFWs) will be protected from corruption and abuse</a> abroad.</p> <p>It is these changes that persuade people like Nique, from Baguio, that Duterte is the right president for the Philippines. \u201cI think he has his hits and misses but more so on the hits. He did warn us that the war against drugs would be bloody, and here it is happening. Foreigners expect that a president should be prim and proper but he was voted by the majority of the Filipinos despite knowing his reputation as then-mayor of Davao.\u201d<br></p> <p>For 47-year-old driver and father of two LeeMar, however, people seem disillusioned by Duterte. \u201cMany Filipinos seem to be under a spell. They have become fanatical and smug in defending Duterte from any criticism, and have become intolerant towards others who dare to speak against him. I am deeply troubled of what I am seeing. I see a people with their good values slowly being destroyed.\u201d</p> <p>Duterte also prompted an international backlash after calling both <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/06/son-of-a-whore-was-not-meant-to-be-personal-duterte-tells-obama\">Barack Obama</a> and <a href=\"http://time.com/4328906/rodrigo-duterte-pope-francis-philippine-president-son-whore/\">Pope Francis</a> a \u201cson of a whore\u201d.

Wag tayo masyadong literal [Let\u2019s not be too literal].\u201d</p> <p>Father Joey Evangelista, a Roman Catholic priest based in Mindanao, says Duterte\u2019s way of simplifying things is his major flaw. \u201cHe is unable to perceive nuances in many delicate issues.

That was a misunderstanding of Tagalog vernacular. I also think the international media are ignoring the fact that he is outspoken about the control the United States has on the Philippines for their failure to answer for the abuses they committed during their occupation of our country.</p> <p>\u201cAs a nationalist, I absolutely agree with him that the US has been abusing its relationship with the Philippines to gain unfair strategic military advantage in south-east Asia.\u201d</p> <p>Randal, who originally voted for Grace Poe but now supports Duterte, said: \u201cHis implementation is coming in fast. He did more for our country in just three months compared to other past presidents. I believe he is the right kind of leader in this point in our nation\u2019s history. I believe he will wipe out crime and corruption more than anyone can, and will also bring order and discipline which we desperately need. He is a wonderful president but needs to shut up sometimes.\u201d<br></p> <p>But for an anonymous 28-year-old government employee, Duterte\u2019s performance so far has been dismal. \u201cHe is singlehandedly destroying democracy and decency in our country. If there is any move to kick him out of office, count me in.\u201d</p> <p>According to a survey by leading Philippine public opinion polling body <a href=\"http://www.sws.org.ph/swsmain/home/\">Social Weather Stations</a>, Duterte\u2019s first 100 days as president have been <a href=\"http://www.rappler.com/nation/148359-duterte-very-good-rating-sws-survey-100-days\">\u201cvery good\u201d</a>, with 76% of the 1,200 respondents saying they were satisfied with his performance. Filipinos may be divided in what they think of their president, but for the majority of the population he is seen as someone fighting for the dignity of the country and doing so with a can-do attitude. But what about what the rest of the world think? Father Joey Evangelista said: \u201cThe world did not care about the Philippines before. Why is it, all of a sudden, concerned about the Philippines now?\u201d</p>",
  "<p>I dropped out of Birmingham University in the Easter of my first year. The course wasn\u2019t what I expected, and I was so unhappy. I moved back in with my mum at our council house in Lincoln and got a part-time job as a cleaner. I was getting more and more down. My mum had started going to this roller derby thing and dragged me along. I hadn\u2019t roller-skated since I was eight, but I loved it.</p> <p>Roller derby is a team sport, played on an oval track about the length of four badminton courts. On the track at any one time are four blockers and one jammer from each team. It\u2019s a point-scoring sport, and the jammer is effectively the ball. The basic premise is to get your jammer out of the pack of blockers and around the track, while preventing the opposition jammer from doing the same.</p> <p>It\u2019s a full-contact sport and knocks happen, but we try to be as safe as possible. We wear helmets, mouth guards, knee, elbow and wrist pads; you can\u2019t target the neck, head or anywhere below the knee. It\u2019s physical, but not aggressive. The roller derby community is great and everybody hugs and high-fives at the end of a game.</p> <p>It requires a unique type of fitness. Bouts are 60 minutes long and you\u2019re repeatedly knocked to the floor. It\u2019s intense. I\u2019m stronger than I\u2019ve ever been as a result and I feel more at home in my body. I\u2019ve always been aware that I have hips and a bum, and I used to be very shy about it. Now, I definitely own the space I\u2019m in.</p> <p>Joining the sport at 18, I had my eyes opened to a lot of strong, empowering women. They made me realise I didn\u2019t need to put so much pressure on myself to follow a particular path. A few months after I started playing, I applied to the University of Lincoln. I got in, completed my degree and now live and work in London. Without a doubt, roller derby had a big impact on where I am now.</p> <h2><strong>My weekend workout</strong></h2> <p><strong>How often do you train? </strong>Three times a week with my team and twice a week at the gym.<br><strong>Number of bouts? </strong>Nine in the last year (we won seven).<br><strong>Proudest achievement? </strong>Getting accepted into Europe\u2019s number one league, <a href=\"http://londonrollergirls.com/\">London Rollergirls</a>.<br><strong>Favourite soundtrack to skate to?</strong> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KWZGAExj-es\">Elastic Heart by Sia</a> \u2013 it has a really nice beat.</p> <h2><strong>Five ways to get started: roller derby</strong></h2> <p>1<strong> </strong>Don\u2019t worry if you can\u2019t roller-skate. All clubs run programmes for newbies. It can take up to a year to feel confident enough to play competitively, so be patient.</p> <p>2<strong> </strong>You can never be low enough in roller derby. Practise skating with knees bent and your weight in your heels. This is a strong position with a low centre of gravity and gives you more control. If you stand upright, you\u2019re like a pendulum, very unbalanced.</p> <p>3 Don\u2019t be scared of falling over. One of the first things you learn is how to fall safely, which tends to be on to your knee pads. You\u2019ll be skating around, someone will blow a whistle and you all have to fall on your knees. It\u2019s a real laugh.</p> <p>4<strong> </strong>Roller derby\u2019s not just for girls. The men\u2019s sport has grown a lot, though the teams are more spread out because there isn\u2019t the same level of uptake. Some leagues even have co-ed games.</p> <p>5<strong> </strong>There are hundreds of teams all over Europe. Just type \u201croller derby\u201d and the name of your nearest city into Google to find your local league. Then keep an eye out for their next new intake.</p> <h2><strong>Essential kit</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"484de24683b30e49bc68eded1269f0d09c2c08d7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/484de24683b30e49bc68eded1269f0d09c2c08d7/149_82_2238_1343/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Composite Roller Derby Smith Scabs Elite II knee pads Bont Quadstar skates Constellations leggings\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><a href=\"http://www.doublethreatskates.co.uk/collections/roller-derby-knee-pads/products/smiths-scabs-elite-knee-pads-1\">Smith Scabs Elite II knee pads</a>, \u00a365.95, doublethreatskates.co.uk<br> <a href=\"http://www.doublethreatskates.co.uk/collections/roller-derby-skate-packages/products/bont-quadstar-skate-package\">Bont Quadstar skates</a>, \u00a3229.95, doublethreatskates.co.uk<br><a href=\"http://www.thepowerofgreyskull.com/collections/leggings/products/constellations\">Constellations leggings</a>, \u00a340, thepowerofgreyskull.com</p> <p><strong>\u2022 </strong>Do you have a passion for exercise?

And last month, crowds gathered to support refugees. All worthwhile, important causes. But about the Syrian conflict? Almost nothing. Certainly nothing comparable to those crowds.</p> <p>The same applies to Paris, Berlin, Madrid, Rome. To be fair, in Brussels, on Tuesday,<a href=\"https://syria.liveuamap.com/en/2016/4-october-aleppo-protest-outside-the-european-commission\" title=\"\"> some people did demonstrate</a>, holding \u201cSave Aleppo\u201d placards: there were a hundred or so demonstrators on Schuman Square. But street protests denouncing Aleppo\u2019s plight are confined to small groups \u2013 often exiled Syrians and human rights activists. There is none of the grassroots mobilisation that other wars \u2013 Iraq in 2003, or the Gaza conflict \u2013 have triggered. Nor have artists, trade union leaders, intellectuals or politicians, who have in the past been prompt to organise anti-war movements, shown any determination to get the crowds out to call for an end to the slaughter in Syria.</p> <p>It may be that we have become numb to the constant stream of horrifying news, including the <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/01/world/middleeast/aleppo-syria-civilians.html?_r=0\" title=\"\">more than 100 children killed last week</a> in Aleppo by airstrikes. It may be that Syria seems too complex an issue. But what is complex about saying civilians should be protected? What is complex about denouncing those who are currently dropping untold amounts of ordnance on neighbourhoods and hospitals?</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The carpet bombing of Grozny was aimed at emptying the city, either by killing its people or making them refugees</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Yes, it\u2019s true western governments criticise Russia and Bashar al-Assad. It\u2019s also true that at the UN, diplomats have compared Aleppo to Guernica and Srebrenica. But do official statements make any show of public anger redundant? Aren\u2019t basic human values worth standing up for in the face of atrocities \u2013 if only to show solidarity?</p> <p>Or could it be that we are wallowing in an ocean of \u201cpost-truth\u201d politics, where Russian and Syrian government propaganda has made us doubt they are breaking international law? Have we started to believe carpet-bombing can be understood as anti-terrorism? Have we started thinking it would be best for Aleppo to be captured swiftly?

  "<p><strong>Is broadband as bad as Theresa May\u2019s party conference speech implied?</strong></p> <p>Nearly. Her complaint that \u201chalf of people living in rural areas, and so many small businesses, can\u2019t get a decent broadband connection\u201d is probably based on a <a href=\"https://www.ofcom.org.uk/research-and-data/infrastructure-research/connected-nations-2015\">report produced by the regulator Ofcom</a> last year, which is now a little out of date. Ofcom found 1.5m rural premises \u2013 about half of the total \u2013 could not get the basic speed needed to watch video and support multiple devices such as tablets, phones and smart TVs. The regulator said it would be another three years before all these premises get the 10 megabits per second (Mbps) it considers a minimum for modern users. Things have improved since then, thanks to the taxpayer-funded BDUK scheme to wire up the countryside. The total suffering from slow connections has fallen to 25% across all rural areas, though half of those living in hamlets are still below 10Mbps. Business parks have also complained of being left out. Ofcom said last year that only 68% of small and medium-sized businesses have superfast, with some 400,000 still waiting. The problem is not confined to rural areas. BT\u2019s superfast broadband roll-out, which has now reached 90% of all homes and businesses, is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/apr/06/wealthy-stranded-digital-expensive-properties-lack-fast-internet-uk\">bypassing those living in tall buildings</a> \u2013 from council tower blocks to highrise luxury flats.</p> <p><strong>How is the UK doing compared to other countries?</strong></p> <p>Not too badly \u2013 for now. The average customer can download at a rate of 15Mbps, which means the UK ranks 20th in the <a href=\"https://www.akamai.com/us/en/multimedia/documents/state-of-the-internet/akamai-state-of-the-internet-connectivity-report-q2-2016.pdf\">global speed league</a>. But much smaller economies such as Bulgaria, Romania and Belgium are already faster. South Korea is at the top of the pile, with 27Mbps, and Norway is in second place with 20Mbps. The concern is that, having finished the bulk of its superfast upgrade, BT does not have sufficiently ambitious plans for the future. Homes are still connected to street cabinets by copper wires. The company plans to extend fibre-optic cables closer to its customers\u2019 doorsteps, using a technology called G.Fast, but copper will still be used for the final stretch. BT claims G.Fast will deliver speeds of up to 300Mbps, which is more than most users need for now. But experts say the only future-proof network is one that uses fibre cables only, all the way from the exchange to the premises. Fibre to the premises, or FTTP in telecoms jargon, is at least three times as fast and would ensure no fall in speeds at peak times. BT and Virgin Media, the two biggest network operators, plan to connect a mere 3m premises between them using FTTP. To be fair, BT says it will fill the gaps in its superfast roll-out by focusing on tall buildings, business parks and high streets. But other countries, including China, France, Portugal and New Zealand, have much bigger plans.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"71fe59080e0a1418211127212bcc558616bd9327\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/71fe59080e0a1418211127212bcc558616bd9327/543_730_3847_2308/1000.jpg\" alt=\"BT boss Gavin Patterson is prepared to take on the government with legal action and a halt to investment if structural separation is forced through.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">BT boss Gavin Patterson is prepared to take on the government with legal action and a halt to investment if structural separation is forced through.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Michel Euler/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>What would improve broadband?</strong></p> <p>Rivals say BT needs to split off its infrastructure division, Openreach, into a separate company.

In July, MPs concluded that BT was <a href=\"https://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=3&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi49_va8MbPAhWJtBoKHXZ9AOAQFggqMAI&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.publications.parliament.uk%2Fpa%2Fcm201617%2Fcmselect%2Fcmcumeds%2F147%2F147.pdf&amp;usg=AFQjCNGMfAPkfTWe2tGP4_u-IoXd5TnvPg&amp;sig2=Z2N4kpEtqpplLNYKPCbvKA\">\u201csignificantly under-investing\u201d</a> in Openreach, to the tune of hundreds of millions of pounds a year. Funds that should be going into broadband were instead being spent on football rights designed to boost the newly launched BT Sports channels. A top-class TV service is part of BT\u2019s strategy to stop its customers defecting to other providers. Since <a href=\"http://%20https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/feb/10/premier-league-tv-rights-sky-bt\">BT started competing with Sky</a> for live football, the amount collected by clubs each season has rocketed from \u00a3594m to \u00a31.7bn. BT counters that it spends less on football than on fibre \u2013 this year it will invest \u00a31.4bn in its network, and last year it spent \u00a3544m on sports rights.</p> <p><strong>What are the practical hurdles?</strong></p> <p>BT chief executive Gavin Patterson has threatened 10 years of litigation and a halt on network investment if the government forces through structural separation. The BT pension scheme is a big obstacle. The largest occupational scheme in the country, its deficit stands at almost \u00a310bn. Splitting the commitment would be a complicated and expensive business. Ofcom is proposing a middle way: legal separation. Openreach would get a board of its own, with control over budget, ownership of the network and a directly employed workforce. If this still doesn\u2019t work, Ofcom boss Sharon White says \u201cwe would return to the option of full separation\u201d.</p> <p><strong>Is Theresa May serious about sorting rural broadband?</strong></p> <p>Time will tell. Ofcom\u2019s proposals for legal separation were published at the end of July, just a couple of weeks after the new Conservative leader moved into 10 Downing Street. The prime minister has not had a chance to put her own stamp on the strategy, but her keynote gave no clue as to whether she will push for a stronger remedy.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jul/25/bt-willing-to-give-broadband-division-more-independence\">BT willing to give broadband division more independence</a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong>Is infrastructure spending the answer and will it happen?</strong></p> <p>Labour thinks so. It has promised to raise \u00a3500bn for investment in infrastructure, including broadband. The chancellor, Philip Hammond, last week made a more cautious case, for \u201cvery carefully for targeted, high-value investment in our economic infrastructure\u201d. Other governments are spending in this area. Singapore has already connected every home to fibre, although in a 720<sup> sq km</sup> city state, this was a fairly straightforward task.</p> <p>In Australia, the job of wiring vast expanses of outback required special measures. Structural separation was forced on the Telstra network in a negotiation that took five years. The government committed A$30bn to fitting FTTP to 93% of homes. Initiated under a Labour administration, the project has since been scaled back. <a href=\"https://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjzzoWx8MbPAhVLHxoKHZMYBrsQFggcMAA&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nesta.org.uk%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fexploring_the_costs_and_benefits_of_ftth_in_the_uk_v7.pdf&amp;v6u=https%3A%2F%2Fs-v6exp1-ds.metric.gstatic.com%2Fgen_204%3Fip%3D77.91.250.206%26ts%3D1475780912296952%26auth%3Dndatah6i3624ptoywrzyg3qaupv52oyy%26rndm%3D0.381090010381282&amp;v6s=2&amp;v6t=21359&amp;usg=AFQjCNFtU4LwIlc4wWS5lOYL6owWgOwZZQ&amp;sig2=f4EMJlQFVoceVJ3-_E7s0A&amp;bvm=bv.134495766,d.d2s&amp;cad=rja\">Estimates for the cost of a national all-fibre network</a> in the UK vary from \u00a325bn to more than \u00a350bn. That kind of money could probably not come from the private sector alone. Campaigners argue that splitting BT would not only allow government investment, but could unlock private-sector spending, too. An independent Openreach would be a FTSE 100 company in its own right, with \u00a35bn a year in revenues and plenty of muscle with which to raise funds.</p>",

I came of age during the 1980s when there was no work and no sense of a future. I worked as a waitress and then went to university. I got a grant, albeit a small one, but still had to work. Sometimes I had to choose between heating and eating, which is no joke in Glasgow where I was studying. But I did quite well and moved into academia in the New Labour years when academic wages shot up, and finally got some economic stability.<br></p> <p>I bought my first flat in 2004 for \u00a3150,000 \u2013 it was above a shop in West Norwood, south London. It was a complete dump. I sold that and bought another in Haringey for \u00a3289,000. We were both working and earning good money. We sold it during the financial crash because it wasn\u2019t great for bringing up a small child, and bought a tiny house in Walthamstow in 2010 for \u00a3270,000. We benefited from gentrification, because our house earned more than we did. We sold it recently for \u00a3575,000 and moved to North Essex, massively reducing our mortgage.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I wish that all the promises made after the second world war were kept.

Just when I began to settle into having secure employment from 36-41 the screws were tightening in the higher education sector and I had a baby, which wasn\u2019t a great mix, and I went freelance. But because of the London property market, and the fact I bought flats and worked on them, I feel quite asset rich, which is a joke really \u2013 I\u2019m not compared with many people who are more solidly middle class.</p> <p>Owning your home is certainly a lot better than renting in London. That said, private ownership makes me very angry and I think house prices have totally messed up the economy. Everyone should have a decent place to live. I\u2019d like our society to be more communal, more lived in the streets than the home. Spending all your money on housing encourages social isolation and an obsession with status, like who has the best kitchen \u2013 while some people can\u2019t feed their children.</p> <p>I wish that all the promises made after the second world war were kept. But successive generations have suffered the consequences. Not equally, of course. I can remember being on a student demonstration outside a Tory party conference and delegates went in the hall waving their wallets at us. They knew what that was about, that we had nothing, and they thought it was funny. I\u2019ll never forget that image. They\u2019re still doing it, aren\u2019t they?\u201d</p> <h2>\u2018We were lucky \u2013 we couldn\u2019t afford it today\u2019</h2> <p><em><strong>Mike Tizard, </strong></em><em><strong>51, is married with two children</strong></em></p> <p><strong>\u201c</strong>We bought our first flat in 1995, at the age of 30, almost by accident. Despite having no money we were about to get married, and had just seen a terrible place to rent in Oval, south London. We saw a queue of people outside an old hospital. We went over thinking it was an art exhibition \u2013 45 minutes later we\u2019d put down a \u00a3100 refundable deposit on a one-bed \u00a360,000 flat in the basement. It turned out to be the best decision we ever made.</p> <p>At the time the London market was on its knees, and our endowment mortgage was just 0.99% for the first year.

Our Oval flat had almost doubled in value to \u00a3109,000, and we paid \u00a3137,000 for our two-bed flat upgrade. A spell in the west country and abroad for three years saw us rent the flat out, covering our mortgage. When we returned to south London in 2004, with two small children in tow, houses were already unaffordable, so reluctantly we moved to Hertfordshire. The Herne Hill flat sold for \u00a3310,000, and our four-bed house cost \u00a3390,000, which seemed like a fortune.

It was relatively easy and we had a good choice of lenders and rates. I now own the flat with my husband, who bought my ex\u2019s share. The equity on it enabled us to buy in Bristol, where we moved when I set up <a href=\"http://thebathmassagecompany.com/\">The Bath Massage Company</a>, which is thriving.

That said, I think that it is so much harder to be financially stable now.

Yet the books from which they derive are closely connected. Hawkins\u2019s novel is one recent, hugely successful incarnation of a type of fiction that Collins invented. We call it the \u201cpsychological thriller\u201d.</p> <p>Collins is simply one of the most influential of all English novelists. In the 1860s he published his four great \u201csensation novels\u201d (as they were dubbed by contemporary reviewers): <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2009/nov/26/woman-in-white-150-years-sensation\"><em>The Woman in White</em></a>, <em>No Name</em>, <em>Armadale</em> and <em>The Moonstone</em>. Wildly popular for a time, his books were largely scorned as melodramatic crowd-pleasers after his death in 1889, but began to be reassessed in the late 20th century (now almost all of them are in print as \u201cclassic\u201d editions). Look closely at his most powerful books and it is extraordinary how many of the features of the modern psychological thriller he foresaw.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/video/2016/sep/29/emily-blunt-the-girl-on-the-train-video-interview\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/553hc\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2758278\"            data-video-name=\"Emily Blunt on The Girl on the Train: 'The vomit was not my own' \u2013\u00a0video interview\"            data-video-provider=\"guardian.co.uk\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-57ebf399e4b01b56deffc51c\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/09/29/160929GirlonTrainJunketV2_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/09/29/160929GirlonTrainJunketV2.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/09/29/160929GirlonTrainJunketV2_WebM.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/video/2016/sep/29/emily-blunt-the-girl-on-the-train-video-interview\">Emily Blunt on The Girl on the Train: \u2018The vomit was not my own\u2019 \u2013 video interview</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p><em>The Moonstone</em> is the story of a crime within a family. In the first instance, a famous diamond is stolen during a weekend house party at a country home. In trying to discover what has happened to the jewel, the novel\u2019s characters, including the falsely accused hero Franklin Blake, begin stumbling on the dark secrets at the heart of their respectable social circle. What began as the story of a theft eventually takes in obsessive sexual passion, suicide, embezzlement and murder. Sergeant Cuff, the great detective who is dispatched from London, fails to find the thief but is the catalyst for the uncovering of these secrets. Collins elaborates his plot entirely through the accounts of witnesses and participants. The reader must piece it all together.</p> <p>Calling a thriller \u201cpsychological\u201d credits it with a kind of literary complexity. The very first recorded use of the term \u201cpsychological thriller\u201d was in an admiring review of Somerset Maugham\u2019s <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/painted-veil.html\"><em>The Painted Veil</em></a> in 1925. Most dictionaries of literary terms lack an entry for this genre, as if it were a figment of reviewers\u2019 or publishers\u2019 imaginations. A cynical interpretation would be that it is a thriller that an intelligent person is happy to be seen reading. Hawkins\u2019s novel gained a place on Barack Obama\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2016/aug/19/all-the-presidents-reading-lists\">summer reading list</a>, thereby endorsed as the thinking person\u2019s page-turner. A couple of years ago it was Gillian Flynn\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/gone-girl\"><em>Gone Girl</em></a>, also made into a glossy and violent film, that successfully filled this niche.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>In this genre, the killer is not a dedicated monster, but someone close to us, someone familiar</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>It is where genre fiction and literary fiction overlap. One of the books on this year\u2019s Man Booker shortlist, Ottessa Moshfegh\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/aug/20/eileen-by-ottessa-moshfegh-review-bell-jar\"><em>Eileen</em></a>, is declared to be a \u201ctaut psychological thriller\u201d in a quotation from an admiring reviewer blazoned on its cover. Certainly it displays some of the key features of the psychological thriller. It has a first-person narrator on whom we rely, yet whose view of the world sometimes seems warped. <em>Eileen</em> works as an administrator in a prison for young offenders, whom she likes to study. \u201cThe best was when I could see the hard face of a cold-hearted killer breaking through the chubby cheeks and callow softness of youth. That thrilled me.\u201d Like those of a character in a novel by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/ruth-rendell\">Ruth Rendell</a> (the British doyenne of the psychological thriller), her thought processes are at once logical and twisted. <em>Eileen</em> has a narrative that, we know with delicious apprehension, is heading towards a nasty, probably violent, conclusion. There is already talk of a film adaptation of Moshfegh\u2019s novel. This is hardly surprising: \u201cpsychological thriller\u201d has long been a description applied equally to novels, on the one hand, and film or TV dramas, on the other.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"b191b4ebe69633554690ed9960ec37750c5e5929\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b191b4ebe69633554690ed9960ec37750c5e5929/0_322_2760_3449/800.jpg\" alt=\"Sarah Hadland and John Thomson in the BBC\u2019s The Moonstone\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sarah Hadland and John Thomson in the BBC\u2019s The Moonstone.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ray Burmiston/BBC/King Bert/Ray Burmiston</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In one way these stories are the opposite of the serial killer fantasies with which we have been diverting ourselves for several decades. In the psychological thriller the killer is not a dedicated monster, it is someone close to us, someone familiar. The genre thrives in domestic settings. Tell Amazon that you like \u201cpsychological thrillers\u201d and you will be offered novels with titles such as <em>The Woman Next Door</em> by Cass Green, <em>Follow You Home</em> by Mark Edwards or <em>Behind Closed Doors</em> by BA Paris. It is no accident that the settings of both <em>Gone Girl</em> and <em>The Girl on the Train</em> are banal. <em>Gone Girl</em> is mostly located in a numbingly ordinary Missouri town where Nick and Amy move after their careers in New York falter. <em>The Girl on the Train</em> takes place in a fictional commuter town on the rail line from Euston.</p> <p>Each novel concerns itself with the mysteries within marriages. Indeed, both rely on the unsettling, fascinating idea that a man or a woman might not really know the person to whom he or she is married. They are tales of shocking marital discoveries, seen from within. The trick of Flynn\u2019s novel is to set the husband\u2019s and the wife\u2019s narratives alongside each other. For a long while it looks as though Nick has the secrets and knows better than Amy \u2013 but slowly you begin to understand that the reverse is the case. And indeed, that Nick has little idea of the full force of his wife\u2019s insight and willpower.</p> <p>This discovery of what might thrill us in domestic circumstances should also be credited to Collins. It was Henry James who famously saw his originality in these terms. \u201cTo Mr Collins belongs the credit of having introduced into fiction those most mysterious of mysteries, the mysteries which are at our own doors.\u201d The bourgeois household is his stage: no wonder his mysteries turn so often on the testimonies of servants. Terrible things happen in familiar places. In <em>The Woman in White</em> the most frightening location is a comfortable family home in Hampshire, within a few minutes\u2019 walk of a railway station.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fcb22334443769a37b4f2c24c130816341980cd1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fcb22334443769a37b4f2c24c130816341980cd1/0_224_3508_2105/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ben Affleck and Rosamunde Pike in the film version of Gone Girl.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ben Affleck and Rosamunde Pike in the film version of Gone Girl.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/New Regency Pictures</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In his great novels of the 1860s, Collins invented a series of narrative tricks and peculiar plot elements that thriller writers still draw on. <em>The Girl on the Train</em> depends on the fact that one of its narrators, Rachel, suffers from alcohol-induced memory loss. She struggles through the book to recover the memories that might explain a woman\u2019s mysterious disappearance. She even wonders whether she might somehow be responsible. It was Collins who introduced to the English novel this strangest of possibilities: that a person might not know what they know \u2013 might not even know what they have done. In <em>The Moonstone</em> opium removes some characters from conscious control over their actions. In <em>Armadale</em> Lydia Gwilt, the beguiling villainess, swears by it. \u201cWho was the man who invented laudanum? I thank him from the bottom of my heart.\u201d (Laudanum was opium steeped in alcohol.) Collins\u2019s close friend <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/charlesdickens\">Charles Dickens</a> was so intrigued by the fictional possibilities of opium addiction that he put it at the heart of his own, unfinished psychological thriller, <em>The Mystery of Edwin Drood</em>, in which the frighteningly obsessive choirmaster John Jasper is wedded to the drug.</p> <p>One returns to Collins\u2019s novels with the thrill of recognition. Even some of his unaccountable quirks have become conventions of thriller writing, though modern practitioners will have been unaware that they were following a pattern set by this unconventional Victorian. So, for instance, Collins liked to use physical disabilities in his mystery stories. The heroine of <em tabindex=\"-1\">Hide and Seek</em> (1854) is deaf. It was followed by <em tabindex=\"-1\">The Dead Secret</em> (1857), in which the heroine, Rosamond Treverton, marries a blind man. His later novel <em tabindex=\"-1\">Poor Miss Finch</em> (1872) features a blind heroine. This exploration of radically restricted perceptions seems to be another version of his interest in altered states of consciousness.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"fda810dec59148fcf9cb768e3f9143ccdaeb37f5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fda810dec59148fcf9cb768e3f9143ccdaeb37f5/201_178_2477_3096/800.jpg\" alt=\"Wilkie Collins (1870).\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Wilkie Collins (1870).</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Hulton Archive/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Some of this interest was rooted in experience. Collins himself had become an opium addict as a result of taking large doses of laudanum to relieve his rheumatism. He knew all about the narcotically induced trances of which he wrote. Indeed, it is hard to imagine that his stories could carry such conviction if he had not himself led such an unconventional life. The son of a painter, he came from a bohemian background and remained a sworn enemy to bourgeois conformity. He liked to dress idiosyncratically and he flaunted his Francophilia. He loved French cooking and approved of liberal French attitudes to sexual mores. He never married but had long-term relationships with two women. The first was Caroline Graves, a widow with whom he lived for almost three decades and whose daughter he adopted. The second was Martha Rudd, a servant he met on a holiday in Norfolk, by whom he had three children and whom he maintained in comfort in a separate London household. All were acknowledged and provided for in his will.</p> <p>Though Collins was the pioneer, there were, of course, other sensation novelists. Writers like Mary Elizabeth Braddon, Charles Reade and Mrs Henry Wood thrilled the Victorian reading public with their tales of bigamy, fraud and sexual passion. Yet Collins was singular not just because he was the first, or because his plots remain the most intriguing, but because he was formally adventurous. Above all, he pioneered the use of multiple narrators. His preface to <em>The Woman in White</em> declared, \u201cAn experiment is attempted in this novel, which has not (so far as I know) been hitherto tried in fiction. The story of the book is told throughout by the characters of the book.\u201d Collins made it possible that a narrator might even be a culprit. He showed how to extract thrills from narrative unease. In <em>The Moonstone</em> the characters are like witnesses in a courtroom. They include the garrulous steward, Gabriel Betteredge, the heroine Rachel Verinder\u2019s absurdly moralistic cousin, Miss Clack, and the opium addict Ezra Jennings. Often they have misunderstood what they have seen. No Godlike narrator presides.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/video/2014/oct/03/gone-girl-you-night-draft-day-life-after-beth-video-reviews\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/42599\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2169027\"            data-video-name=\"Gone Girl, You and the Night, Draft Day and Life After Beth: the Guardian film show \u2013 video reviews\"            data-video-provider=\"guardian.co.uk\"            data-video-poster=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2014/10/2/1412269710341/Ben-Affleck-in-Gone-Girl-021.jpg\"> <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-448756809\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2014/10/2/1412269710341/Ben-Affleck-in-Gone-Girl-021.jpg\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2014/10/02/141002TGFSGoneGirl2-16x9.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2014/10/02/141002TGFSGoneGirl2_3gpSml16x9.3gp\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2014/10/02/141002TGFSGoneGirl2/141002TGFSGoneGirl2.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2014/10/02/141002TGFSGoneGirl2.webm\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2014/10/02/141002TGFSGoneGirl2_3gpLg16x9.3gp\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/video/2014/oct/03/gone-girl-you-night-draft-day-life-after-beth-video-reviews\">Gone Girl, You and the Night, Draft Day and Life After Beth: the Guardian film show</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>Multiple narration is common in the modern psychological thriller. <em>The Girl on the Train</em> has three alternating narrators. <em>Gone Girl</em> shifts back and forth between the narratives of Nick and of Amy. No one can quite be trusted. \u201cI\u2019m a big fan of the lie of omission,\u201d Nick tells us in <em>Gone Girl</em>. A candid admission of deceitfulness, it is the novel\u2019s way of alerting the reader to the need for suspicion. We are a third of the way through Flynn\u2019s novel before Nick happens to mention that he has been conducting a torrid affair with one of his students for the previous year (though the intermittent call alerts of his disposable mobile phone have already made us aware that his narrative was not complete). \u201cNow is the part where I have to tell you I have a mistress and you stop liking me \u2026 I have a pretty, young, very young mistress, and her name is Andie. I know. It\u2019s bad.\u201d (Worse in the film, where her age is reduced from 23 to 20.) \u201cMy vote for unreliable narrator of the year,\u201d declares one reviewer of <em>The Girl on the Train</em> in a quote reproduced on the cover of the British edition of the novel. A phrase \u2013 \u201cunreliable narrator\u201d \u2013 coined in the early 1960s by a little known American prof, Wayne C Booth, in a densely academic book, <em>The Rhetoric of Fiction</em>, has become a standard term in book reviews and publishers\u2019 puffs.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Collins\u2019s febrile states often surface in today\u2019s thrillers as characters question their own fears and memories</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Collins liked to experiment with different narrators. His longest and most complicated novel, <em>Armadale</em>, begins as a conventional third-person narrative, but then expands to include letters and first-person testimonies, and finally, grippingly, a diary written by the villain Lydia Gwilt, a formidably intelligent, red-haired governess, a murderer and a blackmailer, who uses her sexual allure to trick men. (One contemporary reviewer called her \u201cLydia Guilt\u201d by mistake). She is fond of quoting Byron\u2019s poetry and for relaxation plays Beethoven sonatas on the piano. Though ruthless, she finds herself falling in love with one of her intended victims. Eventually, her love for him prevents her gaining the fortune she seeks. She schemes to cheat the novel\u2019s hero out of his inheritance, finally deceiving him into spending the night in a private asylum in Hampstead, where, with the assistance of the corrupt alienist Dr Downward, she attempts to murder him with poison gas as he sleeps. All this would be so much melodrama if we did not have her own account, and in particular the journal in which she records her mental torments as well as her infernal plotting.</p> <p>The documents that make up Collins\u2019s narratives are not inert records: they become part of the story. In <em>The Woman in White</em>, in a coup de theatre that would be called postmodern if it happened in a novel of the early 21st century, the diary written by the novel\u2019s wonderfully resourceful heroine, Marian Halcombe, which we have been reading for more than a hundred pages, is suddenly interrupted by a \u201cPostscript by a Sincere Friend\u201d. With a chill we realise that the new narrator is the ingenious villain Count Fosco himself, relishing the \u201cunexpected intellectual pleasure\u201d he has taken from reading the journal of the woman who has been trying to frustrate his nefarious schemes against her sister, Laura. Marian has fallen ill and he has purloined her narrative, joining the disconcerted reader in praising her talents and her courage. \u201cYes! These pages are amazing\u201d, and increase his admiration of \u201cthis sublime creature\u201d. \u201cThe presentation of my own character is masterly in the extreme.\u201d How he regrets that he and she are foes. \u201cI condole with her on the inevitable failure of every plan that she has formed for her sister\u2019s benefit.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"17ff3e92308b3dcb229cfd3c0af0a8197899fb0a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/17ff3e92308b3dcb229cfd3c0af0a8197899fb0a/0_83_3504_2102/1000.jpg\" alt=\"James Mcavoy in the film adaptation of Atonement (2007).\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">James Mcavoy in the film adaptation of Atonement (2007).

In <em>Gone Girl</em> \u2013 in a narrative twist that the film version of the story found hard to replicate \u2013 the apparently ingenuous diary being written by Amy turns out to be her device. \u201cThe diary, yes! We\u2019ll get to my brilliant diary.\u201d We are more than halfway through the book before we discover \u2013 one of those overturnings of expectations that Collins relished \u2013 that this diary, one of the narrative threads that we have been following, is a fiction Amy is using to incriminate her husband. It has become a familiar trick of literary fiction (Ian McEwan uses it in both <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/atonement.html\"><em>Atonement</em></a> and <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/sweet-tooth.html\"><em>Sweet Tooth</em></a>), but is peculiarly suited to the psychological thriller. The firm narrative ground disappears from under our feet. Collins\u2019s interest in unsettling our confidence in a narrative is what makes him seem so modern. One of the first reviewers of <em>Armadale</em> noted shrewdly, \u201cIf it were the object of art to make one\u2019s audience uncomfortable, without letting them know why, Mr Wilkie Collins would be beyond all doubt a consummate artist.\u201d</p> <p>Collins turned the apprehensions of his characters into the stuff of his fiction. \u201cNervous\u201d is one of his favourite adjectives: characters suffer \u201cnervous restlessness\u201d or \u201cnervous dread\u201d or \u201cviolent nervous agitation\u201d. Often their \u201cnerves\u201d are \u201cshaken\u201d; sometimes they are \u201cshattered\u201d. They are sensitised to the terrors of the plots in which they find themselves entangled. Their febrile states still often surface in psychological thrillers, as characters question their own fears and perceptions. Rachel, the main narrator in <em>The Girl on the Train</em>, descends from Collins. A partially recovering alcoholic, she struggles to tell the difference between her memory and her imagination. She is not sure what she saw on the night that a woman disappeared. Much of Hawkins\u2019s novel is narrated in the present tense, enacting the feverishness of its main characters.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c6aa6c483da58b43c767ea36a924aba5a5b49fae\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c6aa6c483da58b43c767ea36a924aba5a5b49fae/0_0_3504_2103/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Rachel Watson in the film adaptation of The Girl on the Train.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Emily Blunt as Rachel Watson in the film adaptation of The Girl on the Train. Photograph: Allstar/Dreamworks SKG</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/Dreamworks SKG</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>All of these are women and it has frequently been noted that contemporary psychological thrillers often feature \u201cdifficult\u201d female protagonists. (In an article in the London Review of Books, critic <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/jacquelinerose\">Jacqueline Rose</a> arraigned both Flynn and Hawkins for producing post-feminist fiction that in fact encouraged \u201chatred of women\u201d.) Collins invariably put women \u2013 usually unconventional, difficult women \u2013 at the centre of his novels. In <em>No Name</em>, the resourceful Magdalen Vanstone uses disguise and elaborate deceit to try to win back her rightful inheritance. In <em>Armadale</em> the notional protagonist, Alan Armadale, is an impetuous, good\u2011hearted bore, but the villainess, Gwilt, is constantly surprising and intriguing. Collins felt and wrote passionately about the injustices that women suffered as a result of illiberal marriage and divorce laws, and intolerant attitudes to \u201cfallen women\u201d. After <em>The Moonstone</em> he started using his novels rather too bluntly to campaign on such issues. But he had shown later novelists how to combine narrative suspense with psychological complexity.</p> <p>His novels have their Victorian preoccupations, naturally. They always depend on arcane legal issues, usually to do with the conditions of wills and rights of inheritance, about which Collins took detailed advice from lawyer friends. He had had a legal training, though he never practised as a lawyer, and was an avid reader of accounts of trials. Each of his novels also satisfied his first readers by achieving something like poetic justice at its conclusion. He knew that the Victorian public demanded happy endings. Yet his readers were also invited to glimpse the possibility that crimes could go unpunished. In a memorable exchange in <em>The Woman in White</em>, Count Fosco undermines the confidence expressed by Marian and Laura that \u201ccrimes cause their own detection\u201d. Only if the criminal is a fool, he retorts. The Count strokes his pet mice and laughs \u201cinwardly and silently\u201d at the pious thought that criminal deeds bring retribution. \u201cAsk Coroners who sit at inquests in large towns if that is true, Lady Glyde. Ask secretaries of life-assurance companies if that is true, Miss Halcombe. Read your own public journals.\u201d All around them crimes take place that are not even identified as such \u2013 \u201cbodies that are not found\u201d and \u201cwise criminals who escape\u201d. Those crimes are still there for novelists to uncover.</p> <ul> <li><em>The Moonstone</em> begins on 30 October on BBC1.<br></li> </ul>",

Because the operator was trying to save money, the group of pilgrims were told to leave the hotel at midnight, forcing the coach party to head to the airport several hours early.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"8fa778c5de2a65ff465da8000f979faf069ccb9c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8fa778c5de2a65ff465da8000f979faf069ccb9c/0_41_1200_1500/800.jpg\" alt=\"Bathroom facilities that one family from Rochdale had to endure.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bathroom facilities that one family from Rochdale had to endure.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: None</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cWe were waiting three hours in the Jeddah streets in the coach with no water or food, and nowhere to do the prayers,\u201d Minhas says. \u201cOur flights home included a 17-hour stopover in Beirut, for which we had been promised hotel rooms. But when we arrived they didn\u2019t exist. We were forced to just wait in the airport where the shops would only take US dollars, and we had none, and no way of getting any.

The number of complainants that do come forward are part of a large number.

  "<p>It is a scary time to be raising daughters. According to a study from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/sep/29/self-harm-ptsd-and-mental-illness-soaring-among-young-women-in-england-survey\">NHS England last week</a>, more than one in four women aged 16-24 now have a mental health condition. They are the most at-risk group for psychological problems, with three times more young women than men reporting symptoms of depression and anxiety. And in 2014, self-harming among young women was three times more common than it had been in 2007.</p> <p>So what can we do to help ensure the mental wellbeing of girls? Here are 10 ideas from our team of experts.</p> <p><strong>1. Don\u2019t add to the pressure school places on them</strong></p> <p>\u201cSchools are under tremendous pressure to meet targets, and a lot of that has been passed on to parents,\u201d says Sarah Kendrick of <a href=\"https://www.place2be.org.uk/\">Place2Be</a>, a charity that provides emotional support to pupils in schools. \u201cAnd, of course, it\u2019s important as parents to have expectations for our children. But home should be a safe place, a haven where children know they are valued for much more than their academic ability.\u201d</p> <p><strong>2. Decide jointly on rules for phone and computer use</strong></p> <p>Instead of stressing about your daughter\u2019s use of her mobile, think about how you use your own phone. \u201cGirls sometimes describe how they\u2019re trying to tell their mum something, and she\u2019s not really listening because she\u2019s checking emails on her phone \u2013 or it keeps buzzing the whole time with new messages,\u201d says Jane Lunnon, head of Wimbledon High School for girls. \u201cWe have to role-model how to use technology in our own lives.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Take on new challenges; show your daughter how to be adventurous</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Parents need to lead the way by putting their devices to one side during conversations and at mealtimes. Have some rules on technology, but decide on them together, says Lunnon. \u201cTalk to your children about what they think would work. That way, you\u2019ll nail down rules they have a vested interest in and will want to keep.\u201d</p> <p><strong>3. Take time out yourself</strong></p> <p>Remember to look after yourself and your own mental health. \u201cMake sure you\u2019re not living a totally stressed-out life,\u201d says Mumsnet founder Justine Roberts, herself the mother of 17-year-old twin girls. \u201cDaughters need to see their mums taking time out for themselves, getting enough sleep, and not spending the whole time in a frantic panic. And try not to go on about diets and food fads. It\u2019s not good for teenage girls to see their mum preoccupied with all this \u2013 it will make them anxious about their own diet, which is the last thing any of us wants.\u201d</p> <p><strong>4. Show them it\u2019s OK to fail</strong></p> <p>Don\u2019t forget to show them that failure is OK. Girls need to know that it\u2019s fine to fail, that we all fail at times in our lives, and that what matters is not so much failure, but how you deal with it. \u201cYou don\u2019t want failure to be this terrible thing that can\u2019t happen,\u201d says Roberts. \u201cTake on new challenges; show your daughter how to be adventurous. And when something doesn\u2019t work out \u2013 because not everything can \u2013 she can see you pick yourself up and carry on. It\u2019s all about building resilience, which is the really important thing for our daughters.\u201d</p> <p><strong>5. Hang out with them</strong></p> <p>Do nothing, and do it together. \u201cThe precious commodity of unpressurised time is the best thing you can give them,\u201d says Roberts. \u201cYou\u2019re letting them know that you\u2019re hanging out with them just because you want to be with them. We\u2019re all guilty of scheduling time and checking our watch, or trying to do two things at once, but there\u2019s nothing that matters more than that time when you\u2019re just together, without an agenda.\u201d</p> <p><strong>6. Sit down together at meals</strong></p> <p>Try to make sure you all put away your phones and laptops and sit down together for a meal at least a few times a week to chat. If you can\u2019t eat together, sit down and talk over a cup of tea. As Lunnon says, \u201cThe thing about social media isn\u2019t just what they\u2019re doing while they\u2019re on it, it\u2019s about what they\u2019re <em>not </em>doing when they\u2019re on it. And that includes time when they\u2019re not chatting with their parents and their siblings, which they need to do.\u201d</p> <p><strong>7. Listen carefully</strong></p> <p>Don\u2019t let girls fend you off. \u201cSometimes, they will try to push you away or say they are not interested in talking about something, but you shouldn\u2019t necessarily leave it at that,\u201d says Dr Caroline Schuster, a chartered psychologist who works with children aged 11 to 18. \u201cYou need to get into a conversation with them about what the problem is. It\u2019s important to listen carefully \u2013 this isn\u2019t about you telling them how to cope, it\u2019s about you listening to whatever the problem is from their point of view. Of course, you can put things into perspective, and that can be very helpful, but always remember to listen first.\u201d</p> <p>No problem, says Kendrick, is ever too small or too big to talk about. And whatever it is that\u2019s troubling your daughter, don\u2019t dismiss it as unimportant: if it\u2019s important in her life, it\u2019s important.</p> <p><strong>8. Muscle in on their media</strong></p> <p>Tune into their world, and raise questions about it. Go to see a film of their choice; browse the websites they are visiting; sit down to watch their favourite TV show with them.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/oct/04/girls-as-young-as-7-feel-pressure-to-be-pretty-body-confidence-girlguiding-study-reveals\">Girls as young as 7 feel pressure to be pretty \u2013 body confidence study</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cThe important thing is to get a sense of the images, programmes and media they\u2019re seeing, so you can start a conversation,\u201d says Schuster. \u201cIt\u2019s the conversation that\u2019s important.\u201d Be careful not to just dismiss everything they\u2019re consuming: get them to think about the messages behind what they are watching. Why do the women in adverts, or on TV reality shows, look the way they do? Does it reflect real life? Guard against sexting disasters by talking about what\u2019s acceptable to send.</p> <p>\u201cTell your daughter, \u2018Before you hit post, imagine everyone in your whole school is seeing this,\u2019\u201d says Roberts. Talk, too, about her right to privacy, and about the fact that she should never feel pressured to behave in a certain way or to interact in a certain way. Make sure she knows she can come to you and that there\u2019s nothing you won\u2019t be willing to discuss.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Withdrawal is the big thing to be wary of</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Lunnon recommends being \u201cquite draconian\u201d on tech issues. \u201cRemind your daughter that you pay for her mobile. If the boat hasn\u2019t already sailed, before you buy her first smartphone, lay down ground rules: access in bedrooms won\u2019t be unlimited, and parents must be allowed to check phones on occasion.\u201d</p> <p>Counter the heavily sexualised and pornography-influenced culture by injecting a bit of realism into their lives. \u201cPromote really positive, non-physical, female role models,\u201d suggests Lunnon.</p> <p><strong>9. Watch for signs of mental health problems</strong></p> <p>Look out for the warning signs of mental health problems. \u201cWithdrawal is the big thing to be wary of, especially if a teenage girl is withdrawing from events that involve her friends,\u201d says Schuster. \u201cIt\u2019s normal for teenagers not to want to go to family events, but at that age their friends feel like the most important people in their lives, so if they\u2019re not taking up invitations to go out to meet them, it\u2019s a warning sign.\u201d</p> <p>So too, she says, are repeated stomach problems, as well as changes in appetite, behaviour, energy levels, sleep and academic performance. Several of these symptoms together can signal depression. If you have worries about your child\u2019s psychological health, take them seriously.</p> <p><strong>10. Life should be fun</strong></p> <p>\u201cWe all need to remember that life is essentially fun, or should be,\u201d says Lunnon. \u201cGirls need reminding of that. Savour opportunities to laugh with them, and don\u2019t take yourself too seriously \u2013 encouraging girls to laugh at themselves is important.\u201d Doing fun stuff together as a family is brilliant for girls; it helps nurture the idea of the family unit, our little band against the world, and that\u2019s important for their sense of identity.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/video/2016/oct/06/teenage-girls-talk-about-anxiety-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/56xb3\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2776332\"            data-video-name=\"Teenage girls talk about anxiety: 'It's always linked to failure' \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"guardian.co.uk\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-57f3cc8be4b0d3973ef5f8d0\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/10/05/161005anxietyCHANGED2_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/10/05/161005anxietyCHANGED2.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/10/05/161005anxietyCHANGED2_WebM.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/video/2016/oct/06/teenage-girls-talk-about-anxiety-video\">Teenage girls talk about anxiety: \u2018It\u2019s always linked to failure\u2019</a></figcaption> </figure>   <h2>Useful resources</h2> <p>\u2022 Young Minds, a charity committed to improving the health and wellbeing of young people, parents\u2019 helpline: 0808 802 5544.</p> <p>\u2022 The Mix, an online support guide for under-25s: <a href=\"http://www.themix.org.uk/\">themix.org.uk</a></p> <p>\u2022 Beat, a charity supporting people with eating disorders, b-eat.co.uk</p> <p>\u2022 <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/what-i-told-my-daughter.html\">What I told My Daughter</a>: Lessons from Leaders on Raising the Next Feneration of Empowered Women, by Nina Tassler, Cynthia Littleton, published by Simon &amp; Schuster.</p> <p>\u2022 So Sexy So Soon: The New Sexualised Childhood and What Parents Can Do to Protect their Kids, by Diane E Levin and Jean Killbourne (Ballantine Books).</p> <p>\u2022 Cinderella Ate my Daughter: Dispatches from the Front Lines of the New Girlie-Girl Culture by Peggy Orenstein (Harpercollins).</p> <p>\u2022 <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/living-dolls.html\">Living Dolls: The Return of Sexism</a> by Natasha Walter (Virago).</p> <p>\u2022 <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/steve-biddulph-s-raising-girls.html\">Raising Girls</a> by Steve Biddulph (Harpercollins).</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/aug/24/teenage-girls-mental-health-overlooked-parents-survey\">Teenage girls' mental health overlooked by parents, survey finds</a> </p> </aside>  <h2>Sexual pressure: How to keep your child safe online<br></h2> <p>Parents trying to protect their daughters from sexual pressures often don\u2019t know where to start, especially as so many are totally unaware of the social media platforms their children are using.

Its <a href=\"https://www.nspcc.org.uk/preventing-abuse/keeping-children-safe/share-aware/\">Share Aware campaign</a> is an ideal way for parents to find out about different types of social media and to start talking to their children about sexual pressures from an early age. Two NSPCC films \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sch_WMjd6go\">I Saw Your Willy</a> and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwcL-VP3FYc\">Lucy and the Boy</a> \u2013 are highly entertaining and, while produced for younger children, are also a great icebreaker with teenagers and can help to start much more serious conversations.</p> <p>The Scottish national youth information service <a href=\"http://www.young.scot\">Young Scot</a> is also extremely useful for parents. It is highly aware of the role that social media can play with peer pressure and staying safe, and it covers everything from sexting to revenge pornography. A live Snapchat movie, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHF3TC0KCjU\">Bad Romance</a>, which is aimed at educating young people on the signs of exploitation, is equally helpful to parents.</p> <p>Brook, the leading UK sexual health and wellbeing charity for young people, believes it is vital for parents to build a trusting relationship with their children and keep an open-door policy so that children feel comfortable enough to approach them as soon as they have any concerns. However, because young people are often too embarrassed to speak to their parents about sex, they should be encouraged to speak to another trusted adult if needed.

Use Wi-Fi security settings and do your homework on sexting, pornography and staying safe online.

  "<p>You captivated me when we first met. You were fiercely attractive and hugely independent, and you burned brighter than anybody else in the room. I had never encountered a woman like you. I feel it only fair to remind you that I also shone in those days, able to silence a room with a ballad sung from the heart or to regale people with a&#xa0;humorous story. I was handsome, fit, funny and successful. (I believe I still am.) We had lots in common \u2013 theatre, music and an appreciation of good food. We shared the same values and a sense of what was right and wrong. And in those early days, we enjoyed each other.</p> <p>A year after meeting, we moved in together. Three months later, we got engaged. Around this time I began to lose you. Whatever the reason, we began to talk less. Little silences at first, that grew into days, then weeks. When I asked if everything was OK between us, the answer was always the same \u2013 you were tired, we would talk about it some other time. We never did. And in the silence, your anger grew.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>When you did speak to me, shouting became your normal mode of communication and it continues to this day</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>We married. Had our beautiful children. Built our dream home in the countryside. And in the 13 years that followed, I lost you completely.</p> <p>Months would pass without you even looking at me, never mind speaking. You began to treat me not just as a stranger, but also as an enemy. When you did speak to me, shouting became your normal mode of communication and it continues to this day. When I arrive home in the evening, I sit in my car and listen to you shout&#xa0;at our children.</p> <p>In company, you talk across me, shutting me down. It is clear that I am of no interest to you. You isolate me by keeping day-to-day family happenings from me (how many times have family or friends seen a puzzled look on my face when an upcoming family event is mentioned?). This is how you exert your power, your control. But worst of all was when you started trying to enlist our children as soldiers in our private, pointless war. I\u2019m not sure I&#xa0;can ever forgive this act.</p> <p>Every night when the house quietens, you follow me to bed. In silence, you get under the bedclothes, always turn your back to me and switch off the light. No goodnight. Just an aching silence. In this moment, I believe I can physically touch loneliness. Every night for 13 years I\u2019ve imagined you turning to me. You touch my arm and ask how I am. \u201cIs everything OK?\u201d In that moment I feel wanted. It never happens. I don\u2019t reach out to you any more. Experience has taught me not to.</p> <p>Three years ago, I convinced you to see a marriage counsellor with me. At one stage, I was asked what I wanted most from you. I said I simply wanted kindness. You just rolled your eyes. The counselling sessions ceased soon after. We never got to identify the source of your anger or of our difficulties.</p> <p>So here I am, 47 years old. The reality is, I will never leave you because of our children, whom I love more than anything in&#xa0;this world. Maybe when they are older and have left home, we will part naturally.</p> <p>Despite everything, sometimes I can still glimpse the beautiful woman I fell in love with all those years ago. I know that we are still both good people. We are just not good for each other.&#xa0;</p> <p>At my relatively young age, I believe I deserve some hope of happiness. I have always taken a somewhat jaundiced view of people who have affairs, believing their flings were usually the product of a casual physical desire, with little care for the consequences. But on my journey through life so far, I&#xa0;have come to understand that many physical connections made outside of marriage are as a result of deep, basic human need \u2013 everyone wants to feel wanted. And sometimes the person closest to you just can\u2019t give you that. <em>Anonymous</em></p> <p><em>\u2022 We will pay \u00a325 for every Letter to we publish.

  "<p>F<em>resh Fruit Crumble</em>, <em>Ice Cream</em> and <em>A Glass of Red</em> are three of the prints by Howard Hodgkin on show at the new premises of the Alan Cristea Gallery in London. Luscious, edible colours make the subject matter of the otherwise abstract images absolutely clear. Food has been one of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2014/sep/26/howard-hodgkin-witty-glittery-proust-painters\">Hodgkin\u2019s subjects over the years</a>. Other prints take places and the weather for their subjects: <em>Blue Evening</em>, <em>Dark Rainbow</em>, and <em>Foreign Garden</em>. Others still unspecified experiences: <em>Surprise Surprise</em>, <em>Absolutely</em> and <em>Outspoken</em>.</p> <p>All have the sensuous immediacy familiar from Hodgkin\u2019s work over the decades. He once described his paintings (ostensibly abstract) as representational images of emotional situations. His prints, which he has been making for more than six decades, aim for a different directness: getting right up close to the experience of things, whetting the appetite, lulling you with beauty, bringing back the smell of rain or old leaves. Each image is a moment of visual intoxication.</p> <p>It was Alan Cristea who convinced Hodgkin that his 1995 series of Venice prints should not be his last, and has cajoled him to return to the difficult and demanding medium. For a painter used to working alone in the studio, producing unique pieces, often over a number of years, the collaborative effort of making prints requires some mental adjustment. Cristea has gently fuelled Hodgkin\u2019s ambition over the past 30 years, and in 2012 the artist made two prints, titled <em>As Time Goes By</em> which, at more than six metres long, are the largest etchings ever made. When asked by an interviewer why he had made such large prints, Hodgkin replied: \u201cTo show that I could\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9c3ea185a0bcefd2a4ac9d0704ba8472aef13ed4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9c3ea185a0bcefd2a4ac9d0704ba8472aef13ed4/0_0_2500_2153/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Surprise Surprise.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"861\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Surprise Surprise.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy Howard Hodgkin and Alan Cristea Gallery, London</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Hodgkin came into his stride as a printmaker in the late 1970s. It was at this moment that, through the use of new techniques, the prints began to become equivalents, or \u201csurrogates\u201d, as Hodgkin once put it, for his paintings; things in their own right. One of the earliest prints in the current exhibition, from 1977, shows a dark mass against a sodden light blue background and is titled <em>A Storm</em>. It was made in New York after hearing of terrible storms in Oklahoma, where Hodgkin had recently travelled, which reminded him of the stormy skies in the paintings of <a href=\"http://mentalfloss.com/article/77438/15-things-you-might-not-know-about-thomas-hart-benton\">Thomas Hart Benton</a>.</p> <p>A few years later Hodgkin began using carborundum, a sticky, lava-like substance, which is applied direct to the printing plate using brush or fingers. (The process had been invented 20 years earlier by Henri Goetz, a printmaker who worked with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/gallery/2012/feb/08/antoni-tapies-art-in-pictures\">Antoni T\u00e0pies</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2011/mar/20/joan-miro-life-ladder-escape-tate\">Joan Mir\u00f3</a>.) The rich, textured mark it produces was a perfect answer to Hodgkin\u2019s desire to get away from the fussiness of traditional printmaking, and the reliance on the drawn, rather than painted mark. The four <em>Venetian Views </em>from 1995, combinations of etching, aquatint and carborundum (one is on view in the new show), which came out of an aborted project to illustrate Thomas Mann\u2019s <em>Death in Venice</em>, were intended to defy the physical limits of printmaking and immerse the viewer in colours and forms.</p> <p>Above all it is through hand-colouring that Hodgkin achieves his immersive effect. He didn\u2019t invent the technique, which has been used for centuries as a way of adding colour by hand to brighten up a monochrome prints, but he has made it his own.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2ee200ef25cd05f41d3cfe2c7e93f6ec9a314c3f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2ee200ef25cd05f41d3cfe2c7e93f6ec9a314c3f/0_0_2500_1718/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ice Cream.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"687\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ice Cream.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy Howard Hodgkin and Alan Cristea Gallery, London</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>No artist has used it with such consistency, and to such great effect. Each of the 30 prints in the edition of <em>Ice Cream</em>, for example, were made in this way; Hodgkin paints an artist\u2019s proof, noting the type of brush used, and the exact mix of paint. A master printmaker, in this case Andrew Smith, who has been hand-colouring Hodgkin\u2019s prints for a number of years, then reproduces Hodgkin\u2019s brushstrokes with fiendish accuracy, using exactly the same brushes and colours, mimicking also the direction and angle of application, the pressure and small movements of the hand that make the marks distinctive.</p> <p>At first Hodgkin provided the person doing the hand-colouring with evocative instructions on how to apply the colour: \u201clike a silk stocking\u201d, for example, or \u201ctoo much is just enough\u201d or, more controversially, \u201cjust like hitting a baby\u201d (an old English expression, Hodgkin explains). They sound a bit like Eric Satie\u2019s directions on his musical scores, all the more direct for being so strangely allusive: \u201clight as an egg\u201d, \u201cfrom the top of your back teeth\u201d and, most memorably, \u201clike a nightingale with a toothache\u201d. Smith has become so adept at reproducing Hodgkin\u2019s marks that he no longer needs instructions, or even to watch the original mark being made, but can tell exactly how any brushstroke was made simply by looking at it, and feeling the weight of personality behind it.</p> <p>Are the prints any less original for having not been touched by the artist\u2019s hand? Nowadays you can go into most successful artists\u2019 studios and find a small team of assistants completing the paintings to order. But replicating, by hand, a highly complex and expressive mark is something else, a matter both of technical skill and empathy \u2013 or a combination of \u201csensitivity and politesse\u201d, as Hodgkin says of Smith. It\u2019s a uniquely personal approach to an impersonal technique. Andy Warhol (who once invited Hodgkin to make a print celebrating the 1984 Winter Olympics) would surely have been jealous.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"48ca7667d4bb21a2d9173d87fbc1a56100d6709b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/48ca7667d4bb21a2d9173d87fbc1a56100d6709b/0_0_2500_1901/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Absolutely.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"760\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Absolutely.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy Howard Hodgkin and Alan Cristea Gallery, London</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Hodgkin\u2019s ability to come up with such concise visual symbols for experience is also remarkable. <em>Dark Rainbow</em> shows two arcs of inky blue on a red swoosh, on a yellow ochre background. Whatever a dark rainbow is, this sums it up very well. <em>Autumn Sky</em> is made up from a yellow and blue strokes that mingle with black and white \u2013 not particularly autumnal colours, but the season is unmistakeable, just as it is with <em>Springtime</em>, even though enclosed by a thick black frame. <em>A Glass of Red</em> brings to mind the late Patrick Caulfield, Hodgkin\u2019s great friend, whose bare images of ordinary moments had a poetic intensity of their own. But Caulfield would never have produced an image so free and symbolic, like a hieroglyph, so visually unlike but then so utterly \u201cof\u201d a glass of red wine.</p> <p>It is often said that Hodgkin creates images based on memories, an act of Proustian recollection \u2013 an easy thought, but a lazy one. One also flatly contradicted by his prints, where he does not draw on experience, but creates it anew. Rather than being a sentimental painter, he is a realist, with all the pathos and comedy of that genre. Forget Proust\u2019s dainty madeleine; think rather of Flaubert\u2019s carp, in <em>Madame Bovary</em>, gasping for air on the kitchen table, a symbol of unquenchable desire \u2013 that\u2019s at least what the large print <em>Big Sister</em> brings to mind, a flurry of dark brushstrokes against a yellow ochre frame. And everything else on the kitchen table is right there in front of you: good enough to eat.</p> <p><em>Howard Hodgkin: After All </em>is at Alan Cristea Gallery, London SW1 until 18 November. <a href=\"http://www.alancristea.com/schedule.php\">alancristea.com</a></p>",

  "<p>How big is an anchovy? It\u2019s a question I\u2019ve asked myself several times this week. More often than not those 30g tins of fillets in oil are the smallest things in my shopping basket and yet for something so small, they loom large in my kitchen. Fully grown, they measure about 30cm longer than the tiny fillets I melt in a pan each time I\u2019ve a soup to make or some pasta that needs an extra oomph flavour-wise.</p> <p>Much like the salt they\u2019ve historically been used to substitute, anchovies have that quality of being equally at home in the limelight \u2013 the flourish on a pissaladi\u00e8re \u2013 or milling around in the background, in say, a nasi goreng. They can add depth of flavour without the slightest whiff of anything fishy. Anchovies may be fish, but that\u2019s not all they are. \u201cThey\u2019re magic,\u201d a friend said, with her first spoonful of these winning tomatoes.</p> <h2><strong>Slow-roasted tomatoes with anchovy and seaweed butter</strong></h2> <p>Sometimes, it\u2019s the little things. The toasted nori flecks and speckles of lemon zest in an anchovy butter is such a good idea, <a href=\"http://detoutcoeurlimousin.blogspot.co.uk/\"><em>DetoutcoeurLimousin</em></a>, I\u2019m struggling to think of something savoury that would not welcome a dollop of this.<br></p> <p><strong>Serves 4</strong><br>500g tomatoes \u2013 sliced in half if large, or left whole if small</p> <p> <strong>For the butter</strong><br>125g butter<br>5g nori sheets, roasted <br>4 whole tinned anchovies in oil<br>1 dried red chilli or 1 tsp red chilli flakes<br>Zest of 1 lemon<br>1 large garlic clove</p> <p>1 Set the oven to 180C/350F/gas mark 4. Add all the anchovy and seaweed butter ingredients to a food processor and blend until smooth and well mixed.</p> <p>2 Put the tomatoes in a roasting dish. Add 2-3 tsp of the butter and roast in the preheated oven for 30-45 minutes, or until the tomatoes have softened.</p> <p>3 Serve the tomatoes and their juices hot, stirred through pasta, dolloped on to bowls of rice or grains, or spread on slices of toast. And do pretty much the same with the remaining butter \u2013 spread on hot toast, mix into hot pasta, dot over roasted veg or baked potatoes.</p> <h2><strong>Anchovy cream</strong></h2> <p><a href=\"https://witness.theguardian.com/user/midwintersnow\"><em>Midwintersnow</em></a> sent in a Swedish childhood fave \u2013 a fishy cream to spread on toast or fill a jacket potato.

They\u2019re as sweet-salty as their Mediterranean counterparts but they\u2019re not anchovies, despite what it says on the very pretty pink tin. They\u2019re sprats. And with cream, they\u2019re also wonderful.<br></p> <p><strong>Makes a big bowlful </strong><br>300ml whipping cream<br>125g tin of Swedish anchovies<br>A sprig of dill, finely chopped (optional)</p> <p>1 Whip the cream and set aside.</p> <p>2 Mash up the anchovies with a fork, then mix into the cream with all the juices from the tin and the dill.</p> <p>3 Either use on toast or jacket potatoes, or as a dip with roast veg, or freeze in portions for future baked-potato emergencies.</p> <h2><strong>Anchovy and mozzarella baguette</strong></h2> <p>Another mum special, which <a href=\"https://witness.theguardian.com/user/arianz\"><em>Arianz</em></a> and his family ate on lazy Sunday nights, in front of Happy Days. I made these for several consecutive breakfasts, which were just as happy \u2013 everyone loved them.</p> <p><strong>Serves 4</strong><br>2 x day-old baguettes <br>50g tin of anchovies, drained of their oil<br>Milk<br>2 mozzarella balls, thickly sliced</p> <p>1 Preheat the oven to 180C/350F/gas mark 4. Cut the baguettes in half, then slice at regular intervals on the diagonal, taking care not to cut all the way through the loaf \u2013 as you would when making garlic bread.</p> <p>2 Put the half loaves in rectangles of tin foil on a baking tray, and drizzle with milk. Set aside for 8-10 minutes, or until the milk has been absorbed.</p> <p>3 Stuff each cut with an anchovy and a mozzarella slice. Wrap in the foil.</p> <p>4 Bake for 15 minutes, or until the bread is golden and the mozzarella has melted, then serve.</p> <h2><strong>Pissaladi\u00e8re Siciliano</strong></h2> <p><em>Faye Cooke </em>AKA<em> @borrowedbread</em>\u2019s tart is a mash-up of two anchovy staples: the puttanesca pasta sauce and the ni\u00e7ois pizza-lookalike.
