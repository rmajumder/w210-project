  "<p>It was a soil bacteria course in New Zealand that convinced Reggie Davis to change his farming methods.</p> <p>The fourth-generation Victorian dairy farmer had become increasingly concerned by the costs, chemicals and time involved in the use of nitrate fertilisers to maintain \u2013 what was considered to be \u2013 high-quality pasture for his dairy herd.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve always regarded myself as a progressive farmer, open to new ideas,\u201d he says.</p> <p>So when his dairy herd nutritionist mentioned that the US biological farming advocate <a href=\"http://www.farmingsecrets.com/experts/arden-andersen/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Dr Arden Andersen</a> was running a soil management course in New Zealand, Davis decided to go. He asked around to see if any neighbours might be interested. Within weeks, 40 other dairy farmers from Victoria\u2019s south-west had signed up for Andersen\u2019s course. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2016/apr/19/crowdfunding-internet-raising-money-farm-finance\">Herdfunding: how the internet is raising money for farms</a> </p> </aside>  <p>That collegiate interest in investigating new farming methods is reflected in figures published by the Australian Dairy Industry Council in its <a href=\"http://www.dairyaustralia.com.au/Industry-information/Sustainability/Industry-sustainability.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\">annual sustainability performance review</a>.</p> <p>According to the 2015 report, 75% of Australia\u2019s dairy farmers recycle water, 60% have sustainable farm management plans and 45% have invested in biodiversity management and conservation planning.</p> <p>Dairy farmers have also set a national target to reduce industry greenhouse emissions by 30% by 2020, and have already cut emissions by 15% \u2013 largely through energy audits of dairy machinery and farm equipment.</p> <p>The report says dairy farmers want to create \u201ca carbon-confident industry\u201d and various software has been created to help to calculate and reduce farm emissions. These include the <a href=\"http://www.dairyclimatetoolkit.com.au/\" rel=\"nofollow\">dairy climate toolkit</a> and the <a href=\"http://www.piccc.org.au/resource/360\" rel=\"nofollow\">dairy greenhouse abatement strategies calculator</a>.</p> <p>There are some industry leaders. Bega Cheese, one of Australia\u2019s biggest dairy product manufacturers, launched a sustainability program in 2014, which led to a $50m investment in environmental initiatives. The company offers climate change adaptation advice for farmers, supporting programs to plant trees for shade and shelter. </p> <p>Similarly Burra Foods, a dairy processor and exporter in Victoria\u2019s south Gippsland region, has recovered 60m litres of water a year from the evaporating process used to produce powdered milk. It has also cut its town water consumption by 20% and expects to make a further 25% reduction by 2017.</p> <p>There are dozens of similar stories across Australia\u2019s dairy industry, which is the country\u2019s third biggest rural industry after beef and wheat. It\u2019s a $13.8bn industry that employs more than 39,000 people on farms and in manufacturing, and an additional 100,000 in related occupations such as dairy research and veterinary services. So if dairy takes a hard hit, regional economies will certainly feel it.</p> <p>The current dairy crisis is taking its toll. In April the processing giants Murray Goulburn and Fonterra announced <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/may/25/barnaby-joyce-announces-dairy-assistance-package-after-cuts-to-milk-price\">cuts to farmgate prices paid to dairy farmers for milk</a>. Murray Goulburn announced the cuts would be retrospective, which meant famers will be forced to pay back about $200m over the next three years. For most farmers, that will average $300,000.</p> <p>Both the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission and the Australian Securities and Investments Commission are investigating Murray Goulburn but many farmers face financial ruin or the possibility of years of debt. It seems a particularly cruel blow for an industry in which the majority of farmers have been prepared to commit to sustainable farming practices.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2016/apr/15/uk-farmers-to-test-hi-tech-beans-that-could-prevent-food-waste\">UK farmers to test hi-tech beans that could prevent food waste</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Reggie Davis is a good example. One of the reasons he decided to take a closer look at biological farming methods was to avoid using chemical sprays to control pasture pests. He\u2019d noticed the lush growth produced by nitrate fertilisers attracted insects such as red-legged earth mite.</p> <p>These are a devastating pest, and controlling an infestation is costly. As well as the price of sprays, and possibly hiring a professional spray crew, farmers may have to buy supplementary fodder for their cows while the affected pasture is treated. The CSIRO estimates the mites, which were introduced from South Africa in the early 1900s, cost Australia\u2019s farmers more than $500m a year in lost production.</p> <p>The Davis family run 600 Friesian cows on their 570-hectare property near Camperdown in south-west Victoria. They\u2019re one of five farming families in the region who have formed a group called the Green Pastures Movement to practice and promote sustainable farming.</p> <p>The famers worked with a local company, Camperdown Compost, to set up a system of compost rows to turn straw, sawdust and cow manure into natural farm fertiliser. It\u2019s a big operation that requires a heavy-duty mechanical compost turner, towed by a tractor, to periodically turn the compost windrows.</p> <p>The Davis farm produces about 2,000 tonnes of compost each year, and this is applied to pasture in autumn at a rate of about one tonne to the acre (or half a hectare). \u201cWe\u2019ve seen a lot of positive changes with our soil health and our cows,\u201d Davis says. \u201cAnd people tell us that our milk tastes better.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/jun/04/transforming-the-bush-robots-drones-and-cows-that-milk-themselves\">Transforming the bush: robots, drones and cows that milk themselves | Paul Daley</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In November 2013, the group of farmers launched their own milk brand, Green Pastures, and negotiated a deal with Coles supermarkets to stock it.</p> <p>The group produces 22m litres of milk annually for the commercial market, and only 1.5m is used for its premium price brand.</p> <p> \u201cIf we could get more sales, that figure would go up, but it\u2019s a hard slog getting the milk on to the shelves,\u201d says Davis.</p> <p>He says the impact of farmgate milk price cuts has been \u201cdevastating, just terrible\u201d for farmers across his region, and has resulted in \u201chundreds of cows being killed as people are forced to destock\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cSo the choice that people make when they are buying milk really does matter,\u201d he says.</p>",

Those who traveled to Boston received their prizes from Nobel laureates: chemist Dudley Herschbach, economist Eric Maskin, Dr Rich Roberts and physicist Roy Glauber.</p> <p>As in past years, the tone of the awards show vacillated from gleeful absurdism to satire to genuine wonder at the lengths to which scientists will let their curiosity lead them.</p> <p>Egyptian urologist Ahmed Shafik, for instance, wanted to know the toll that trousers might take on male rats. He made murine trousers \u2013 covering the animals\u2019 hind legs with a hole for the tail \u2013 in various cloths: 100% polyester, 50/50% polyester/cotton, all cotton and all wool.</p> <p>Rats that wore polyester showed \u201csignificantly lower\u201d rates of sexual activity, Shafik found, perhaps because of the electrostatic charges created by the material. Cotton- and wool-wearing rats were relatively normal.</p> <p>Mark Avis, Sarah Forbes and Shelagh Ferguson, a team from New Zealand and the UK, won the prize in economics for a study of the personalities of rocks. The trio studied a concept called \u201cbrand personality\u201d, or the \u201cset of human characteristics associated with the brand\u201d \u2013 for example wholesomeness, youth, intelligence and sophistication \u2013 by putting pictures of rocks in front of 225 Kiwi students.</p> <p>The students then decided which of 42 traits, 15 facets and five factors to apply to the rocks in question. One, Rock G, was variously described as \u201ca big New York type businessman, rich, smooth, maybe a little shady\u201d and \u201ccarries a black brief case, slick hair, quick thinker and quicker talker.

Living as an urban fox, he scavenged through trash and slept in gardens. As a goat, Thwaites infiltrated a herd in the Swiss Alps and spent three days eating grass, bleating and stumbling over rocks.</p> <p>Foster and Thwaites wrote books about their experiments, respectively Being a Beast and GoatMan.</p> <p>A coalition from the US, Canada, Germany, Belgium and the Netherlands won the psychology award, for asking 1,000 liars how often they had lied over the course of their life, and rating how well they lied.</p> <p>People gradually lied more as they aged out of childhood, the study found, peaking during adolescence, and as adults lied on average twice a day. Lying decreased with age, although some prolific liars may have skewed results. The researchers also acknowledged that the liars might have been lying to them all along.</p> <p>The peace prize went to a gang of philosophers from Canada and the US who published a paper titled On the Reception and Detection of Pseudo-Profound Bullshit.</p> <p>The researchers studied how people understand gibberish that has been framed as if it means something, by creating random but grammatical sentences of buzzwords that sounded like vaguely meditative posters meant to inspire office drones or distract dental patients from the drill.

Who is most likely to fall prey to bullshit and why?\u201d</p> <p>The philosophers asked 280 students at the University of Waterloo to rate the \u201cprofoundness\u201d of real and invented statements on a scale of one to five, and to search for meaning in those statements. Those students most \u201creceptive to bullshit\u201d, they found, were \u201cless reflective, lower in cognitive ability\u201d and more likely \u201cto hold religious and paranormal beliefs\u201d.</p> <p>The researchers admitted their study had limitations, writing: \u201cAlthough this manuscript may not be truly profound, it is indeed meaningful.\u201d</p> <p>A medicine prize was given to German scientists who found that if you have an itch on your left side, you can look into a mirror and scratch your right to relieve it. A perception prize was handed to two Japanese researchers who tried to learn whether bending over and looking at things between your legs changes how things appear.</p> <p>Physics awards were given to researchers from Hungary, Spain, Sweden and Switzerland, who found that white horses attract fewer horseflies and that dragonflies are fatally attracted to black tombstones. The award for literature went to a Swedish author, Fredrik Sjoberg, who wrote a trilogy about collecting flies.</p> <p>The most surprising winner was for chemistry: the automaker Volkswagen, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/sep/09/volkswagen-engineer-pleads-guilty-conspiracy-emissions-scandal-\">caught for violating US emissions law</a>, was granted a nearly worthless Zimbabwean bill to help pay for its massive legal costs.

Naffa attributed the shift partly to the replacement of the controversial \u201cone-person, one-vote\u201d system with proportional representation, as a result of which women have become \u201can asset\u201d, she said. <br></p> <p>Under the <a href=\"http://iec.jo/sites/default/files/2ParliamentaryElectionLawMay2016EN.docx%20%281%29_0.pdf\">new electoral law</a>, passed last year, Jordan has been divided into 23 districts. Citizens select from competing lists in their constituency and vote for individual candidates from the same ticket. There is a minimum quota of 15 female members of parliament, at least one from each governorate.<br></p> <p>The changes, designed to strengthen political parties and discourage a tradition of voting based on tribal allegiance rather than policy platforms, benefited female candidates on several levels, said Dr Amer Bani Amer, director of Al-Hayat Center, a civil society group that monitors elections through its <a href=\"http://www.hayatcenter.org/programs/accountability-governance-and-participation-%E2%80%93-rased-the-observer/\">RASED programme</a>. </p> <p>\u201cFor the first time, we had a large number of female candidates, [with] men and women running together in partnership,\u201d said Amer. </p> <p>Women appeared in all but six of the 226 party lists, including those of Islamist groups. The increased number of female candidates was accompanied by a vital shift in the perception of women. In the buildup to the election, coalitions anxious to tap into the female vote scrambled to incorporate a woman on their lists. Several all-male groups, slower to recognise the increased advantage of aligning with women, returned after the first day of registration to add a female face.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a sign of growing acceptance among the public,\u201d said <a href=\"http://www.whoisshe-women.jo/expert-profile/asma-khader\">Asma Khader</a>, a former minister in Jordan\u2019s government and chairwoman of the <a href=\"https://sigi.org/\">Sisterhood is Global Institute</a> (Sigi), which monitored the election from a gender perspective. \u201cPeople are now ready to see women\u2019s names and photographs on political campaign posters around the country.\u201d<br></p> <p>There were still six lists on which the image of the female candidate was conspicuously absent \u2013 replaced by a picture of flowers or animals in deference to conservative sensitivities.<br></p> <p>Elsewhere, a more progressive stance was epitomised by two national lists composed solely of women. \u201cI wanted to make the point that women can match men in politics; that we have a vital role to play in determining this country\u2019s future,\u201d said Dr Noor Zaza, who formed a three-woman list in the country\u2019s capital, Amman. </p> <p>The strong performance of high-profile female MPs in the previous parliament has contributed to a belief in \u201cwomen\u2019s ability to do good\u201d and effect change, said Naffa. While some female MPs have simply been \u201cmouthpieces\u201d for the tribes they represent, a few, such as <a href=\"http://www.jordanpolitics.org/en/lower-house-member/146/wafa-saed-bani-mustafa/2\">Wafa Bani Mustafa</a>, have taken up pressing causes, including the campaign to overturn the notorious Article 308 of the Penal Code, which grants rapists clemency if they marry their victims.<br></p> <p>\u201cMen are not going to raise these issues,\u201d added Naffa, who emphasised the need for more women in the political arena to confront the inequalities women face in Jordan\u2019s justice system.<br></p> <p>A campaign to increase the female quota to 23 seats, in line with the re-division of districts under the new law, failed earlier this year. Across Jordan, the <a href=\"http://www.entikhabat.jo/en/content/2016\">allocation</a> for quota seats remains disproportionate, with competition significantly stiffer in certain governorates.</p> <p>In Amman, Rula al-Hroub, a prominent former MP, lost her seat. A strong voice against corruption and widely known as a fearless critic of the government, al-Hroub made three thwarted attempts to form lists before securing running mates just 24 hours before registration closed.</p> <p>\u201cNone of the men wanted to run with me \u2013 they saw me as a threat to their chances of winning the seat,\u201d she said, claiming that strong female candidates are at a disadvantage under the new system.<br></p> <p>While the new law is \u201ca good step\u201d, the system needs \u201cfurther editing\u201d to place women on an equal footing with men, said Dr Amer, citing the <a href=\"http://www.quotaproject.org/country/tunisia\">example of Tunisia</a>, where lists are required to be gender-equal.<br></p> <p>In terms of female representation in parliament, Jordan still lags behind other countries in the region, ranking 13th in the Arab world and 141st globally, according to research conducted by Sigi.<br></p> <p>\u201cThis is not something that one election can solve,\u201d said Asma Khader, prescribing a \u201clong process of activism\u201d and greater \u201cinvolvement of women in public and political life.\u201d</p> <p><br></p> <p><br></p> <p><br></p> <p><br></p> <p><br></p> <p><br></p> <p><br></p> <p><br></p> <p><br></p> <p><br></p> <p><br></p> <p><br></p> <p><br></p> <p><br></p> <p><br></p> <p><br></p> <p><br></p>",

  "<p>A meeting of Snapchat evangelists held in the heart of London\u2019s hipster Silicon Roundabout district could have been ripe for mockery.

It\u2019s a generational shift, Kubbernus said. \u201cOur parents lived in the generation of the cold war, a generation of surveillance, and communism was lurking.

When you produce content on a mobile, you start thinking about that.\u201d</p> <p>Social media encourages more positive stories, Omar said. \u201cGood news is driving traffic infinitely more.

  "<p>There are some startling and eerie moments in this YA-style horror thriller, adapted by Mike Carey from his 2014 bestseller \u2013 but some uncomfortable zombie cliches and uneven performances. </p> <p>In a post-apocalyptic Britain, an army camp is encircled by \u201chungries\u201d, who have to be kept at bay with automatic fire or flame-throwers. Meanwhile, within the compound, a group of special children \u2013 junior hungries with distinct mental abilities and zombie-ism under control \u2013 are being taught by liaison officer Helen Justineau (Gemma Arterton) in a special class, where they are held in restraints. They are studied by sinister scientist Dr Caroline Caldwell (Glenn Close) and supervised with military discipline by Sergeant Eddie Parks (Paddy Considine). But against all instructions, Helen is beginning to have indulgent feelings for her children, especially Melanie, played by newcomer Sennia Nanua. </p> <p>We get some nicely creepy scenes from Close and some impressive digitally confected panoramas of a wrecked London. But as ever with zombie films, the infected ones \u2013 both extras and speaking roles \u2013 are required to do a lot of silly, unscary am-dram gurning. The way children are represented is uncertain, particularly an Artful Dodger-type crew of hungries who have to be fended off. There are substantial talents involved in this film, but it doesn\u2019t come together.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjGkB_oWTe0\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/HjGkB_oWTe0?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>",

It\u2019s also not a new issue for American women.</p> <p>The notion that women are fundamentally untrustworthy snakes through almost every area of our lives. Managers distrust women who <a href=\"https://www.shrm.org/ResourcesAndTools/hr-topics/behavioral-competencies/global-and-cultural-effectiveness/Pages/Managers-Distrust-Women-Flextime.aspx\">ask for flextime</a>; women who <a href=\"https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/fulfillment-any-age/201511/why-dont-we-trust-angry-women\">show anger</a> are less trusted than their male counterparts; and people think the <a href=\"http://www.latintimes.com/wearing-lot-makeup-make-women-look-competent-attractive-untrustworthy-study-finds-132086\">more makeup a woman wears</a>, the less trustworthy she is. (In fact, there is a trove of \u201cdon\u2019t trust women\u201d memes inspired by before-and-after pictures of women with makeup.)</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/20/hating-trump-hillary-clinton-rules-stop-treating-democratic-candidate-literal-white-supremacist\">Hating Donald Trump isn\u2019t enough \u2013 we need to talk about why Hillary Clinton rules | Lindy West</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Republican policies and conservative thought, too, rely on this belief. Legislators have tried to pass laws that would mandate women get <a href=\"http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2014/12/republican-wants-women-get-permission-father-having-abortion\">written permission from men</a> before obtaining abortions, or have suggested that rape and incest exceptions would give way to <a href=\"http://www.newser.com/story/115351/indiana-rep-women-will-lie-about-rape-to-get-abortions.html\">women lying about abuse</a>. There is a reason that one of the phrases most often used by the pro-choice community is \u201ctrust women\u201d.</p> <p>When it comes to sexual assault or domestic violence, victims \u2013 the vast majority of whom are women \u2013 are still widely disbelieved. When Amber Heard brought charges against her then-husband Johnny Depp, she was accused of fabricating the allegations to <a href=\"http://www.breitbart.com/big-hollywood/2016/05/29/johnny-depp-amber-heard-inventing-domestic-violence-allegations-win-millions-divorce/\">extort him in their divorce settlement</a>. Only when a video of Depp appearing to behave aggressively was released and Heard donated millions from the settlement to a charity did the scrutiny slow. There are literally dozens of women who have accused Bill Cosby of rape, and still there are people who believe every single one of them is making it up, something I find barely credible. The way that the police doubt sexual assault victims has even been shown to be part of the reason we have such a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/sep/14/why-police-ignored-80000-kits\">backlog of untested rape kits</a>: officers treat women shoddily and they don\u2019t want to come back to pursue charges.</p> <p>When we don\u2019t trust women, when we disbelieve them even in the face of thoroughly convincing evidence, everyone suffers.</p> <p>Clinton has been deemed untrustworthy by the public long before Trump came into the political picture, it\u2019s true. And like most politicians, she\u2019s given the public reasons to question her. But it\u2019s impossible to divorce the way that voters view her from the misogyny she\u2019s faced over decades. She\u2019s considered \u201cguarded\u201d \u2013 but how could she not be after years of sexist smears and slights? Trump, on the other hand, is lauded for \u201ctelling it like it is\u201d even as so much of what he says is shown to be untrue.</p> <p>The act of trusting women shouldn\u2019t be a radical act, and women shouldn\u2019t have to jump through hoops to be considered credible. No matter your politics, the double standard here is hard to ignore.<br></p>",
  "<p>Just three matches remain in the 2016 season as the best finals series in living memory hurtles towards its conclusion. Another engrossing weekend is in prospect with two contrasting match-ups showcasing the best this rollercoaster of a season has to offer.<br></p> <p>The subplot to both matches is the impact of the pre-finals bye week, meaning Geelong and GWS have both played only once in three weeks. Will they be rested and cherry ripe, or underdone and cold?</p> <h2><strong>Geelong vs Sydney</strong></h2> <p>Nearing the end of an unpredictable year there\u2019s something reassuring about knowing Geelong or Sydney will make the grand final. Both are blue chip stocks, the kind investors squirrel away and forget about, only to nod sagely when they\u2019re reminded how they\u2019ve increased in value, again, ahead of schedule. </p> <p>It\u2019s five years since Geelong\u2019s last premiership, four for Sydney, and both line-ups reflect the hybrid nature of their list development. Eight Cats and seven Swans will bring flag-winning experience to bear on Friday night, while Sydney have named eight men and Geelong five with fewer than 50 games of league football under their belts. </p> <p>With home state advantage, one match in the calendar month, and an almost entirely fit squad, the Cats will start nominal favourites. If there is a concern it could be the growing feeling among the league that the Cats\u2019 defence is vulnerable at ground level, and Sydney have no shortage of small forwards to exploit this perceived weakness. At the other end the absence of Daniel Menzel with an adductor injury is both heartbreaking and significant. The intelligent mid-sized forward is a vital link in Geelong\u2019s attacking chain and his composure and vision will be hard to replace. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/sep/20/from-the-footy-almanac-vault-barry-dickins-remembers-mud\">From the Footy Almanac vault: Barry Dickins remembers mud</a> </p> </aside>  <p>John Longmire\u2019s biggest distraction is the fitness of his troops after two gruelling finals and a succession of injuries. Coming off a six-day break there\u2019s no doubt the Swans will be playing sore, but will it be an impediment significant enough to prevent them going toe to toe with the Cats for four quarters? Thursday\u2019s team sheets revealed Jarrad McVeigh and Callum Mills have not been named but Kurt Tippett, Zak Jones and Gary Rohan all have. Expect the Cats to put plenty of bodywork into all three early on and attempt to emulate the success of GWS two weeks ago. </p> <p>There\u2019s not a wealth of incidental material to draw upon to help better predict this outcome. Sydney have won three of the last four between these teams, including their only meeting this season at Simonds Stadium. The MCG could be a factor. The Swans have only played there twice this season, and not since round nine. The Cats have played there five times, winning on four occasions, and this season moved into a new training facility at <a href=\"https://www.deakin.edu.au/about-deakin/media-releases/articles/deakin-welcomes-cats-as-mcg-blockbuster-looms\">Deakin University</a> fitted with an MCG-sized oval.</p> <p>All indicators point to a cliffhanger. Only percentage separated the two sides on the ladder, and there\u2019s little margin between them in most of the key statistical categories. One area that does stand out is Geelong\u2019s comparative dominance of centre clearances. The Cats showed against Hawthorn that when Patrick Dangerfield and Joel Selwood get on a centre clearance roll they can generate considerable momentum. </p> <p><strong>Talking Point:</strong> If you\u2019re following Friday\u2019s action somewhere other than the MCG and you\u2019re looking for a drinking game guaranteed to make you wake up on Saturday cursing the world, try taking a sip every time you\u2019re reminded of NIck Davis\u2019 2005 heroics, and Anthony Hudson\u2019s despairing, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvH5yPHOaVg\">\u201cI see it, but I don\u2019t believe it\u201d</a>.</p> <h2><strong>Greater Western Sydney vs Western Bulldogs</strong></h2> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/13/usain-bolt-olympics-rio-sunshine\">Bolt vs Gatlin</a>, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBIhlie2rJI\">Gilmore vs McGavin</a>, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abO0lm6L4T0\">POWs vs Nazis</a>; sport is always more entertaining when there\u2019s a clear good versus evil storyline. Not that it\u2019s fair to say the Greater Western Sydney Giants are that monstrous quite yet, more that they\u2019re a necessary evil in the AFL\u2019s empire-building masterplan (although <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Thomo_Grant/status/778167606830301184\">some</a> <a href=\"http://www.smh.com.au/afl/greater-western-sydney-giants/the-greater-western-sydney-giants-are-the-afls-team-not-sydneys-20160919-grk007.html\">reports</a> would lead you to believe they\u2019re jamming at the crossroads with Robert Johnson). </p> <p>Fortunately our tale has a team of heroes primed to derail the expansionist juggernaut. Appropriately styled in red white and blue, and motivated by a scrappy backstory full of hard luck and pathos, the Western Bulldogs are becoming Australia\u2019s most loved neutral\u2019s choice since <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9BTV7lgNJM\">Shannon Noll</a>. </p> <p>But unlike the safe redemptive world of fiction, in real life the good guys don\u2019t always finish first. And the Bulldogs will be hard pressed to overcome GWS at Spotless Stadium on Saturday evening. The Giants won six of eight at home in 2016, accounting for Hawthorn, Sydney and the Bulldogs along the way. That round nine defeat is the only time the Doggies have top-level experience at the Giants\u2019 home.</p> <p>The Victorians will be carrying plenty of historical baggage into the contest. A record of only one win in ten previous preliminary finals is a significant albatross around the club\u2019s neck. Especially when that record, and the solitary premiership 62 years ago, could be matched in less than a fortnight by a club in only its fifth season.</p> <p>The Giants, rested, confident, and with an enviable array of options, will start as favourites. Their midfield is one of the few that stacks up against the Dogs, and their mix of dangerous talls and smalls at both ends of the ground pose awkward questions for Luke Beveridge. Jeremy Cameron kicked five when these teams last met, and his combination with Jonathon Patton and Rory Lobb doesn\u2019t look a natural fit for the Bulldogs defence, although Matt Suckling\u2019s injury has opened the door for Fletcher Roberts to line up on one of those tall targets. </p> <p>The Bulldogs showed their template for success against Hawthorn: bodies committed to every contest, clean hands, and waves of fast ball movement forward. If their combative midfield group can control the tempo, as they did in their previous two upset final wins, a third could be on the cards.</p> <p>I hope they do it, but I can\u2019t tip them to. The GWS kids were born for this stage. They have the skills and the swagger, and enough senior bodies to shepherd them through, even without the suspended Steve Johnson\u2019s mongrel.</p> <p><strong>Talking Point: </strong>The venue for this preliminary final has been a hotly debated issue but ticket sales suggest the 24,000 capacity Spotless Stadium is spot on. It\u2019s easy to wander into discussions about fairness when it comes to choices like this, but the reality is they\u2019re always going to be business decisions - based around stadium contracts, best-fit, and maximising revenue for the AFL. That doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re always right, of course, but any perceived interference should be presumed a commercial reality, not administrative favouritism.</p> <h2><strong>Photograph of the week</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"aa16941dd36393fb426f5015c760839c6ee05f8f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/aa16941dd36393fb426f5015c760839c6ee05f8f/0_0_1337_1598/837.jpg\" alt=\"A footballer marking the ball\" width=\"837\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Marcus Bontempelli of the Bulldogs marks over Luke Hodge of the Hawks during last weekend\u2019s semi-final.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Michael Willson/AFL Media/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The most emphatic moment of the Bulldogs\u2019 victory over Hawthorn last week was Marcus Bontempelli shoving Luke Hodge to the ground in a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/sep/19/young-bulldogs-come-of-age-bontempelli-bump\">second quarter marking contest</a>.

A reference to Hillary Clinton\u2019s use of a private email server while secretary of state, it was blocked by Democrats.</p> <p>Trump\u2019s reluctance to make public his tax returns has nonetheless drawn scrutiny from both political parties. Mitch McConnell and Paul Ryan, the Republican leaders in the Senate and the House, have both said Trump should release the returns, pointing to longstanding precedent.</p> <p>Clinton has <a href=\"https://www.hillaryclinton.com/page/tax-returns\">released personal tax returns</a> covering 2007 to 2014; her family\u2019s tax returns from 2000 to 2006 were made public during her 2008 presidential run. She and her husband Bill Clinton\u2019s records <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2015/07/hillary-clinton-releases-eight-years-of-tax-returns-120882\">dating back to 1977</a> are now available to the public. Last month, Clinton disclosed her federal income tax return for 2015. Her running mate, Tim Kaine, and his wife Anne Holton released 10 years of their own returns. <br></p> <p>Trump, whose running mate, Mike Pence, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/09/mike-pence-tax-returns-trump-campaign\">has released 10 years of tax returns</a>, is the <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/punditfact/statements/2016/may/18/chris-wallace/most-gop-nominees-1970s-have-released-their-tax-re/\">first major-party nominee</a> to withhold his tax records since Gerald Ford, who assumed the presidency following the resignation of Richard Nixon in 1974. Ford released a summary of data from eight years of tax returns but never disclosed the full documents. Nixon released his tax returns in 1973 <a href=\"http://money.cnn.com/2016/05/11/pf/taxes/nixon-trump-tax-returns/\">while they were under audit</a>.<br></p> <p>Romney has also called upon Trump to release his returns, calling the failure to do so \u201cdisqualifying\u201d. In 2012, Trump urged Romney to release his tax returns after the former Massachusetts governor was reluctant to do so. Romney eventually put out <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/21/romney-releases-tax-return-summaries\">limited information on his taxes</a> after the Republican convention. </p> <p>In their Thursday press conference, Democrats said Trump was \u201cafraid\u201d of what his returns would reveal about his business practices, charitable giving and ties to foreign governments.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s likely those tax returns will show major income for Trump and his family from Russia \u2013 from Russian business interests, from Russian oligarchs,\u201d said Chris Murphy, a senator from Connecticut.</p> <p>\u201cIt will show that the decisions he will make on whether to turn on or off sanctions against Russia could have a multimillion-dollar impact on his wealth.

While the extent of Trump\u2019s investments in Russia is not fully known, there is evidence that Trump businesses have received substantial funding from Russian investors.</p> <p>His charitable foundation has also emerged as a point of contention, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-used-258000-from-his-charity-to-settle-legal-problems/2016/09/20/adc88f9c-7d11-11e6-ac8e-cf8e0dd91dc7_story.html?tid=pm_pop_b\">the Washington Post</a> reporting this week that Trump used $250,000 from his family charity to settle legal problems involving his own for-profit businesses.

  "<p>This sappy, in every sense, based-on-a-true story drama tells the story of how <a href=\"http://marymary.ie/\">Irish landscape designer Mary Reynolds</a> (played by Emma Greenwell) came to compete at the 2002 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/chelseaflowershow\">Chelsea flower show</a>. Reynolds\u2019 entry was a Celtic-themed space made with mature hawthorn trees, weathered stone, wildflowers and lots of waffle about the sanctity of untamed nature. The underlying eco-message is laudable, and the filmmakers deserve respect for getting a movie about garden design financed at all, but they do lay the sentiment on thick with a bulldozer, smothering the good bits with a dense compost of mawkishness and cliche. Consequently, Reynolds comes across here not just as an iconoclastic outsider but as a hippie sprite with Timotei-advert hair who must go to battle with the punctilious tweed-suited upper-class twits who control the Chelsea floor show. Meanwhile, her romantic entanglement with garden builder and part-time fiddle-player Christy Collard (Tom Hughes) becomes an Out of Africa-style love across continents.

He said assuming that the proposal cleared Labor\u2019s internal deliberations, he would invite all parliamentarians to sign on.</p> <p>Labor\u2019s move follows Hanson\u2019s declaration in her first speech in the Senate that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/sep/14/pauline-hanson-first-speech-senate-calls-for-immigration-ban\">Australia was in danger of being \u201cswamped\u201d by Muslims</a>.

I wouldn\u2019t want to see it deteriorate.</p> <p>\u201cAnd here we need to think about the effect it\u2019s going to have on our daily lives. When you see or hear hostility being vented against Muslims in our political debate that\u2019s going to affect how the young Muslim schoolboy or schoolgirl is going to experience life in the schoolyard. Having that kind of exclusion is no recipe for societal cohesion.\u201d</p> <p>The race discrimination commissioner said people who want to remove the words offend and insult from the Racial Discrimination Act often failed to point out that the legislation was not some broad-ranging prohibition, but a specific form of protection. The commissioner said section 18C of the act was about nipping racial hatred in the bud, and preventing it escalating into actual violence.<br></p> <p>\u201cThe Racial Discrimination Act covers acts which offend, insult, humiliate or intimidate on the basis of race,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is a very different thing to offending or insulting on the basis of the football team you support.</p> <p>\u201cPogroms have never been organised, as far as I know, on the basis of the football teams you support. But pogroms have been organised against people on the basis of race and their background.\u201d</p> <p>He also responded to the Essential poll that found 49% support for banning Muslim immigration. \u201cI was surprised and very concerned \u2026 because we\u2019ve had a non-discriminatory immigration policy for many years.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/01/the-debate-about-18c-doesnt-have-to-be-a-left-right-slanging-match\">The debate about 18C doesn't have to be a left-right slanging match | Gay Alcorn</a> </p> </aside>  <p>He said the poll was out of sync with other field evidence which confirmed there was broad-ranging community support for a non-discriminatory immigration policy.</p> <p>\u201cThe numbers may reflect where the debate is at the moment. We have seen about two months of blanket coverage of Ms Hanson, not a week goes by when you don\u2019t see or hear her views about immigration and Islam, and there\u2019s a real danger that we are normalising what might otherwise be unacceptable ideas, beyond the bounds of a liberal democracy.\u201d</p> <p>Again, Soutphommasane urged people to focus on the practical consequences flowing from their statements.</p> <p>\u201cConsider what the full implications of discriminating on the basis of religion will mean. If this is carried out, our immigration officials at our airports and ports are going to have to make calls about who is going to pass and who isn\u2019t.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSound familiar? Well this is what we did during the white Australia policy.\u201d<br></p>",

His is a controversial and unpopular position because the country is viewed as a key partner in the Middle East, but it\u2019s one that\u2019s growing in popularity among politicians in Congress and the Senate.</p> <p>In an interview with the Guardian, Senator Murphy explained that, while he believes the United States\u2019 relationship with Saudi is a vital one, the Gulf state\u2019s activities in Yemen are out of line with US national security interests. </p> <p>\u201cThere has been little to no debate in the US Congress about this country\u2019s participation in civil war in Yemen that\u2019s greatly harming US national security,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Saudis are not immune from criticism.\u201d </p> <p>\u201cMy hope is that while so far it doesn\u2019t seem they\u2019ve made any meaningful changes in the way that they conduct their airstrikes, maybe in the wake of this debate, with bipartisan concern shown for the results for aerial targeting, that they\u2019ll change their way.\u201d</p> <p>Murphy has been willing to question America\u2019s \u201cspecial relationship\u201d with Saudi Arabia for some time but he laid out his stance most definitively <a href=\"http://www.cfr.org/middle-east-and-north-africa/chris-murphy-roots-radical-extremism/p37471\">during a speech</a> at the Council on Foreign Relations in January. </p> <p>In that speech, Murphy said Saudi Arabia\u2019s Wahhabi<strong> </strong>branch of Islam had an insidious effect in many majority Muslim countries, and it was exported using a \u201ctsunami of money\u201d, which more moderate forms of the religion could not compete with.</p> <p>\u201cWhy has Saudi Arabia been largely immune from direct public criticism from political leaders simply because they are a few degrees separated from the terrorists who are often inspired by the ideology their money helps to spread?\u201d Murphy said at the time. \u201cThere\u2019s growing evidence that our support for Saudi-led military campaigns in places like Yemen are prolonging humanitarian misery and aiding extremism.\u201d</p> <p>Saudi Arabia and a coalition of Arab states began an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/mar/26/saudi-arabia-begins-airstrikes-against-houthi-in-yemen\">aerial bombardment</a> of Yemen in March last year to reinstate President Abd-Rabbuh Mansour Hadi, a Saudi ally, after he was pushed out by Houthi rebels. The Saudis consider the Houthis a client of Iran and therefore a threat on their border. </p> <p>What was intended to be a short-lived campaign, has now entered its 18th month and has spiralled into a humanitarian disaster. <a href=\"http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2016/08/10000-killed-yemen-conflict-160830173324902.html\">Ten thousand civilians have died</a>, food and water shortages have led to <a href=\"http://reliefweb.int/report/yemen/yemen-humanitarian-bulletin-issue-15-31-august-2016\">more than a million malnourished children</a>, and aid groups\u2019s access to the country has been blocked. </p> <p>The US has provided military assistance to the Saudi-led coalition in Yemen through intelligence, and help refueling planes while they carry out airstrikes.

Sir Alex Ferguson and Valeriy Lobanovskyi are obvious exceptions who skew the perception, but very few managers have success at the very highest level for more than a decade. It is a difficult, tiring job that requires constant re-evaluation and evolution. The will becomes diminished. It is far too early to suggest that Mourinho is finished at the top, but the doubts are growing.</p> <p>In a world in which pressing, at the top end of club football at least, has become the dominant mode, Mourinho\u2019s preference for reactive football in big games is an outlier. It is too simple to say the game has moved on, but equally he can no longer be said to be at the cutting edge. That contributes to a general crisis of image and that impinges on his capacity to mould others to his will.</p> <p>We\u2019ve got used to him. His attacks on rivals, directors, referees and the authorities once provoked shock; now his every utterance is filtered through the recognition that he likes to play games. That is confusing because there have been times recently when he clearly has lost control of himself only for his outbursts of emotion to be treated as part of some strategy of manipulation. Either way, the impact of his public statements has been diminished; Mourinho no longer commands the narrative as he once did.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5f801e799fee0a4473b1cf1d5ecd7ca57671c209\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5f801e799fee0a4473b1cf1d5ecd7ca57671c209/722_182_1598_959/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jose Mourinho\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Mourinho is not the swaggering young gunslinger radiating vigour and upsetting the established order any more.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Matt West/BPI/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>At the same time, a case can be made that he no longer commands players as he once&#xa0;did.

What\u2019s clear is that there is important work to be done in communities all across the country to build trust and strengthen relationships between individual law enforcement agencies and the communities they\u2019re sworn to serve and protect.\u201d</p> <p>Obama has made this work a priority, Earnest added. \u201cThis is a particularly complex set of issues, in part because we know the vast majority of men and women who work in law enforcement are genuine public servants who work to keep their communities safe.</p> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s also true is that there are legitimate concerns that have been raised about inequities in our criminal justice system, inequities that break down in many cases along racial lines, and those are difficult questions that must be confronted. They cannot be ignored.\u201d</p> <p>He said Obama had spoken publicly about such issues on numerous occasions and convened a 21st century policing taskforce to offer suggestions for law enforcement agencies across the country to build trust. The federal government has shared \u201cbest practices\u201d, helping some communities to make important progress, and would welcome additional resources from Congress.</p> <p>Asked about Donald Trump\u2019s proposal to increase stop-and-frisk, Earnest replied: \u201cI\u2019m not going to respond to comments by a Republican nominee on the campaign trail.\u201d</p> <p>Referring to the police taskforce, he added: \u201cExpanding and doubling down on stop-and-frisk policies is not among the suggestions, for rather obvious reasons.\u201d<br></p> <p>The press secretary also denied that Obama could have done more to address the persistent tensions across the country. \u201cThe president has spoken more about these issues all across the country over the last couple of years than any other public official that comes to my mind. Part of that is because he\u2019s got a responsibility as president of the United States, part of that is because of his strongly held personal views on that topic, part of that is the president\u2019s strong commitment to doing something about it ...

  "<p>The half-truth as you quote Tim Farron as saying about paying for the NHS is that the money has to come out of people\u2019s pockets (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/20/the-guardian-view-on-tim-farrons-health-tax-pledge-its-not-enough-to-love-the-nhs\">Editorial</a>, 21 September). This is not as difficult as it may sound at first if we work out the value to the community of the services provided by the NHS and compare it with the costs. The consistent increase in longevity since 1948 must owe a great deal to its existence, and the addition to the national income year by year must run into billions of pounds if we put a proper value on such things as enabling people to return to work after injury or illness after a shorter absence, or even at all. Reduction in pain and anxiety runs into many more billions, as well as the benefits from improved drugs, new and simpler methods of surgery, treating conditions in outpatients departments, or regular visits to GP surgeries (instead of hospitalisation).</p> <p>If a monetary value were to be put on these and many other of the NHS\u2019s activities, this would produce a \u201cprofit\u201d, year by year. Part of this could then be ploughed back into the service in a similar way to part of commercial and industrial profits being used to finance expansion. It is time to stop nit-picking on the cost side of the NHS and get down to working out just how much we owe it.<br><strong>Harvey Cole</strong><br><em>Winchester, Hampshire</em></p> <p>\u2022 Raising sufficient revenue to finance our currently strained NHS shouldn\u2019t be a problem economically. When a private company employs more people to produce more goods or services that people clearly need and demand, an appropriate price has to be levied to pay wages and other costs, reimburse lenders and reward shareholders. A private insurance company has to levy premiums on its new customers. In no case is such pricing felt to be an undue imposition with adverse economic effects. Indeed, economists generally consider any such move to have positive multiplier effects on the rest of the economy, as the initial new workers increase demand for general consumer goods.</p> <p>The same logic surely applies in the case of public services. Provided people really need and demand the services (obviously very much the case) and more service is indeed given (which should be the case if quality workers are employed), then raising revenue through tax or social insurance should have unambiguously good effects. And we can both safely expand essential services and employ good people in well-paid professional and semi-professional public jobs providing these services, more or less to the point that public need and demand is met. If so, this is a massively important (hitherto insufficiently recognised) point that all political parties need to take on board.<br><strong>Bernard Cummings</strong><br><em>Erith, Greater London</em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"47cf00ac6866b8aa83fbf024abc6292ed3c9884c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/47cf00ac6866b8aa83fbf024abc6292ed3c9884c/0_892_4105_2463/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Operating table and lamp\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">State pensioners should make NI contributions according to their ability to pay, writes Alan Baker.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Henrik Sorensen/Getty</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u2022 I stopped paying national insurance contributions when I reached the state pension age 12 years ago. Since then I have needed to make increasing use of the NHS. I have two suggestions for increasing funding for the NHS.</p> <p>First, require state pensioners to make NI contributions according to their ability to pay. If abolition of the exemption were to be considered ill-advised by political parties fearful that such a measure would lose them votes, then NI contributions could instead be phased out and merged into the income tax system. This approach, less damaging politically, would enable pensioners to contribute to the funding of state pensions and benefits and the NHS fairly, according to their means.</p> <p>Second, the public need to be better informed about the costs of the NHS, so that we might be more willing to pay for its services. The real cost of a \u201cfree\u201d visit to a GP and of \u201cfree\u201d common operations such as hip replacements, cataract removals and heart bypasses should be displayed boldly in surgeries and in pharmacies. More of us might then recognise that the NHS provides excellent value for our money \u2013 and needs more to meet its understandably rising costs.<br><strong>Alan Baker</strong><br><em>Cambridge</em></p> <p>\u2022 The Labour leadership have not been as forthcoming as they might about their views on the NHS.

If it were passed into law, \u00a310bn more annually would become available without any increase in taxation, because the current marketised system costs that much more in administration than did the public service model NHS which preceded it (admin costs are now over 14% of the NHS budget instead of the previous 5%).<br><strong>Jeanne Warren</strong><br><em>Oxford</em></p> <p>\u2022 Your editorial suggests that Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s campaign has failed to provide detail on how he would finance an expanded NHS.

It seems fairly clear in which direction he expects the traffic on those bridges to move.</p> <p>The two men were speaking on Wednesday evening at a reception for German and British businesspeople in the swanky surroundings of the Serpentine Sackler Gallery in London\u2019s Hyde Park. Over glasses of riesling from the Rheingau region near Frankfurt, the Anglo-German business community talked of little else but the opportunity for growth at London\u2019s expense, albeit with scrupulous respect for their host city.</p> <p>Michael Mellinghoff is the managing director of the financial technology firm TechFluence, which helps match startup businesses with investors. \u201cIt [Brexit] is a chance to catch up for Frankfurt because London is so far ahead,\u201d he admitted. \u201cLondon is the world capital of fintech [financial technology] and that\u2019s clearly at risk.\u201d</p> <p>He said companies were making early inquiries about possible alternatives to London while they waited for the detail of what exactly Brexit means \u2013 beyond, of course, Brexit.</p> <p>\u201cThe phones are ringing in Berlin and Frankfurt, they\u2019re ringing in Dublin, they\u2019re ringing in Luxembourg. People are exploring their options already, of course. If you ask me, Britain has shot itself in the foot \u2013 from a logical angle there are not many pros.</p> <p>\u201cMost people are very disappointed about the decision because it brings the UK further away from Germany and the EU. But if it is happening, it is a chance for cities like Frankfurt to take advantage.\u201d</p> <p>Andrea Metz, a lawyer with Luther, a large German business law firm with an office in London, said Frankfurt had the space to accommodate those disillusioned by the Brexit vote and the right conditions to help them prosper. \u201cThere is a lot of office space unused,\u201d she explained. \u201cCompanies in the financial sector also need to save money, so if they relocate to a less expensive city it can be good for the staff and good for them.\u201d</p> <p>There\u2019s no doubt that Frankfurt, while not on a par with London as a truly global city, boasts comparable history and culture as a trade centre. It has been a hub for European mercantilism since the 12th century, while the Frankfurt Messe \u2013 or trade fair \u2013 has endured for half a millennium.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8e16a05bf9784204cf2d30211eafe3ee6aaaa10b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8e16a05bf9784204cf2d30211eafe3ee6aaaa10b/0_4_2592_1555/1000.jpg\" alt=\"City of London\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Boston Consulting Group estimated London could lose 20% of its financial services jobs.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Amer Ghazzal/Rex</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It can call on nearby university cities such as Heidelberg for innovation, hosts more tech start-ups than San Francisco and can market products to 40 millions customers within a 200km (124 mile) radius.</p> <p>Automotive giants such as General Motors, Honda and Mazda have major operations in the region, and about 10% of goods with a Made in Germany stamp on them come from the FrankfurtRheinMain region.</p> <p>Menges insisted that these were not advantages that Frankfurt has over London, but advantages it has over rival cities vying for post-Brexit business. \u201cWe\u2019re here to make it clear that if a businesses decide they have to go elsewhere, we want to be the first port of call.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re not competing against London, we\u2019re competing against other locations for business that might decide to go elsewhere. I think in terms of financial sector it\u2019s clearly Paris and Dublin.\u201d</p> <p>A <a href=\"http://frankfurt-main-finance.com/en/bcg-study-frankfurt-most-attractive-destination-for-londons-bankers/\">recent study by Boston Consulting Group</a> thinks Frankfurt is in the lead.</p> <p>Based on the views of 360 leading bankers, <a href=\"http://www.bcg.de/media/PressReleaseDetails.aspx?id=tcm:89-211080\">it concluded that London could lose</a> 20% of its financial services jobs, with Frankfurt best placed to hoover them up. To make sure it steals a march on its competitors, FrankfurtRheinMain GmbH is even setting up an office in London to extoll the virtues of the \u201cfinancial centre of the Eurozone\u201d and home city of the European Central Bank.</p> <p>That\u2019s a measure of the fact that in some ways, Frankfurt was better prepared for Brexit than the UK was. \u201cWe visited London many times in the lead-up to it. The closer it came, the more we said we needed to prepare for this,\u201d Menges recalls.</p> <p>The early-bird attitude, so often the stereotype about Germans, is already yielding results. Nobody has yet pressed the button on a move to Frankfurt, says Menges, but they are certainly casing the joint.</p> <p>\u201cPeople have to prepare their strategy so we get a lot of calls gathering information. We get calls from law firms saying, \u2018We have a client who requires information.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Ultimately, the upside for Frankfurt will depend on which version of Brexit the UK eventually opts for, with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/22/switzerland-votes-for-compromise-to-preserve-relations-with-eu\">freedom of movement</a> for EU workers and the single market the key issues. \u201cOne would assume that the harder the exit, the bigger the opportunity.\u201d</p> <p>Dublin and Paris haven\u2019t hit the ground at quite the same sprinting pace as Frankfurt, but are also keen to show off their credentials to London bankers.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s a realisation we can\u2019t win all the business, no city can,\u201d said a spokesperson for the Dublin Chamber of Commerce. \u201cBut Dublin has some fantastic attributes that will help it pick up some business from Brexit. Financial services have been well-flagged as an area of potential. The fact we\u2019re so close to London helps \u2013 it\u2019s just an hour away \u2013 and then there\u2019s the language thing as well, while some of our systems and laws are fairly similar. <br></p> <p>In Paris, they are also talking a good game. Arnaud Bresson, managing director of Paris-Europlace, said: \u201cThe big advantage of Paris compared to Frankfurt is that it is much more a business centre for the international banks and Paris is much more capital market-minded, closer to London.\u201d</p> <p>He points out that Paris is also taking concrete measures, setting up a \u201cwelcome office\u201d in the city to help new arrivals fit in and tweaking the rules of \u201cinpatriate status\u201d \u2013 France\u2019s answer to non-dom status \u2013 by extending tax advantages for high-earners from five years to eight years.</p> <p>France\u2019s prime minister, Manuel Valls, also insists that Paris can be the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/06/france-strong-bid-banking-business-poised-to-leave-london-paris-brexit-manuel-valls\">\u201cfinancial capital of the future\u201d</a>.<br></p> <p>Perhaps.

By contrast to Peter Blake\u2019s vivid artwork for the Beatles\u2019 previous album, Sgt Pepper\u2019s, it was a plain white sleeve with the band name just embossed, almost invisible. There was a stamped number, which made each one unique. My parents had it first, but I thought it looked boring until I studied art. Once you understand the context, it gets really interesting. We think of design as for the present moment, but while music doesn\u2019t change, people\u2019s feelings and relations to it do. So the sleeve becomes a reflection of that. It placed an avant-garde idea into the mainstream \u2013 the cover is a blank space on which you can project your fantasies. A few years ago, this guy had a record shop selling nothing but old copies of the White Album. People had drawn on them, made coffee cup rings on them or whatever and each one was different, because it had lived a life. On <a href=\"http://store.davidbowie.com/blackstar-vinyl-lp.html\">the vinyl edition of Blackstar</a>, you can see the record and, over time, watch it decay.

The future seemed right around the corner. At the same time, there was this incredible psychedelic movement going on. It felt as if everything could be different. The musicians were making new worlds. I was obsessed with designing the future, but the graphic designers of the day were hardwiring it into our existing culture with their decades-old design and fonts. That\u2019s why <a href=\"http://www.myraltis.co.uk/rickgriffin/\">Rick Griffin</a>\u2019s cover had such a powerful effect on me, and is still my favourite sleeve. He had changed the use of lettering completely but it was still legible. The painting looks as if it comes from a completely other world. It seemed to be saying to me that the rules were bullshit, that we could do anything we wanted. As an art student, this was like being given the keys to a prison door. I didn\u2019t copy it, but it allowed me to do my own thing. The album is OK, but the cover is blisteringly amazing. When I look at it, I see freedom.</p> <h2>Kraftwerk \u2013 Autobahn (1974)</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ef5bc5a36630f901879e34b5aeae19611648665c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ef5bc5a36630f901879e34b5aeae19611648665c/89_74_2543_2542/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Kraftwerk \u2013 Autobahn.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><em>Chosen by </em><strong><em>Peter Saville</em></strong><em>, famed for his work with New Order, Joy Division and Factory Records</em></p> <p>Autobahn was the first album I ever bought, after I heard the single on the radio. In 1974, as a teenager who had never been abroad, listening to the full 22-minute title track while staring at the autobahn symbol on the sleeve felt like being taken on a journey. I was on a European highway, in a soundscape crafted by classically trained musicians, seeing cathedrals and power stations, villages and skyscrapers, ancient and modern, in time as well as distance. It was a continental tour \u2013 from gothic to postmodern, from the dark ages to Brigitte Bardot \u2013 with the pulsebeat of a speeding vehicle. All defined in a simple symbol. As a fledgling visual artist, this was my first lesson in semiotics. I realised that visual codes acted as keys to unlock the huge range of potential awareness in an audience. Four years later, when I was asked to do <a href=\"http://www.2welve.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/the-factory-poster.jpg\">the poster for the first night of the Factory club</a>, I noticed an industrial warning sign on a workshop door at art college: \u201cUse hearing protection.\u201d I\u2019d been thinking \u201cFactory ... new music ... industrial city\u201d and realised: \u201cThat\u2019s it!\u201d My Autobahn moment.</p> <h2>Hawkwind \u2013 In Search of Space (1971)</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"06f27c06b78ab430e57d5e6eb41c21f608288624\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/06f27c06b78ab430e57d5e6eb41c21f608288624/10_0_1479_1479/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Hawkwind \u2013 In Search of Space.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><em>Chosen by </em><strong><em>Malcolm Garrett</em></strong><em> AKA Assorted Images, designer of classic artwork for Buzzcocks, Magazine, Duran Duran and Simple Minds</em></p> <p>At my grammar school, you displayed your allegiances via the album you carried under your arm: Deep Purple in Rock, Genesis\u2019s Nursery Cryme and so on. The longhairs were outsiders, but to be ever more apart, you carried Hawkwind. The designer, <a href=\"http://www.johncoulthart.com/feuilleton/2007/01/20/barney-bubbles-artist-and-designer/\">Barney Bubbles</a>, was a genius. This wasn\u2019t just a square of card. It <a href=\"https://pathwaygroupstoke.files.wordpress.com/2013/06/hawkwindisoslog2.jpg\">unfolded out to a rough hawk shape</a>. On the front, there was this post-psychedelic, pre-electro, sci-fi mandala. On the back, there were no track titles, just a completely blurred picture of them playing live (which seemed to replicate the Hawkwind live experience) and the words: \u201cTechnicians of spaceship Earth, this is your captain speaking, your captain is dead.\u201d Coming with a booklet of countercultural images and texts, it really broke convention for album packaging. It inspired me graphically, with its geometric shapes and fluorescent colours, and I became immersed in an \u201calternative\u201d lifestyle and took psychedelic drugs. On one trip in Scotland, I was convinced I could see aliens landing, I experienced synaesthesia and distinctly remember listening to this album through my teeth. When the Sex Pistols came along, I realised this outsider attitude applied equally to another counterculture, punk.</p> <h2>Iggy Pop \u2013 Lust for Life (1977)</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5e301930510af6afc0a46e73c904d891ec3495d3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5e301930510af6afc0a46e73c904d891ec3495d3/101_134_2375_2375/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Iggy Pop \u2013 Lust For Life.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><em>Chosen by </em><strong><em>Vaughan Oliver</em></strong><em>, who defined the visual aesthetic of the </em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/oct/10/4ad-label-behind-pixies-cocteau-twins\"><em>4AD label in the 80s</em></a></p> <p>I wanted to design record sleeves from the moment I went to see a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/gallery/2015/oct/21/roger-dean-somewhere-near-here-prog-rock-album-covers-in-pictures\">Roger Dean</a> lecture in Durham when I was 15. His sleeves weren\u2019t about how the band looked, but the use of imagination. In my work, I\u2019m keen on the ambiguous and the mysterious. This sleeve is the complete antithesis of my philosophy, but I like its innocence and directness. I\u2019m not a fan of the graphics, but this image \u2013 given what Iggy was going through in 1977 with heroin addiction \u2013 is just extraordinary. Andy Kent\u2019s photograph isn\u2019t the depiction of a wasted rock\u2019n\u2019roller one might expect. Iggy\u2019s a beautiful man, aged 30, but it\u2019s like a high-school photograph and totally fits the words Lust for Life. I bought it when I was at Newcastle Polytechnic, probably because of David Bowie\u2019s involvement. The sleeve seemed confrontational and unexpected. Iggy looks like a children\u2019s TV presenter or someone about to present the weather forecast, but the record inside is raw and harrowing. It\u2019s the absolute opposite of everything conjured up by the sleeve. I love that.</p> <h2>Pixies \u2013 Doolittle (1989)</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f891db45b3249b2c50dd470752d44f15500cdd36\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f891db45b3249b2c50dd470752d44f15500cdd36/181_310_2378_2378/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Pixies \u2013 Doolittle.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><em>Chosen by </em><strong><em>Tash Willcocks</em></strong><em>, Manchester-based illustrator behind sleeves such as </em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2001/may/04/shopping.culture\"><em>Elbow\u2019s Asleep in the Back</em></a></p> <p>I was brought up in a house in Cornwall where no one listened to music. When I was a teenager, my friends bought this album and showed me it. In 1989, I had never seen anything like it. The combination of Simon Larbalestier\u2019s photography and <a href=\"http://www.hardformat.org/designers/vaughan-oliver-designer/\">Vaughan Oliver</a>\u2019s design and typography was the most beautiful thing I had ever seen. I thought: \u201cWhatever that is, that\u2019s what I want to do.\u201d I had always been a messy person, but suddenly everything made sense. I realised that in art and design, you can get your hands dirty, make mistakes and embrace them. Before this, to me, a record cover meant a boyband on a sleeve, which made me want to puke, but here was something I could emotionally engage with. It gave me no answers, only a million questions. Why are the letters like this? Why is the print over the top of everything? I can\u2019t even remember playing it, just staring at it and it taking over my brain. It gave me permission to be me, which has influenced everything in my life.</p> <h2>Rammellzee Vs K-Rob \u2013 Beat Bop (1983)</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e3ecbae19190182e92a238979e33f8c25dd83b82\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e3ecbae19190182e92a238979e33f8c25dd83b82/0_0_1589_1600/993.jpg\" alt=\"Rammellzee versus K-Rob - Beat Bop.\" width=\"993\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><em>Chosen by </em><strong><em>Tony Hung</em></strong><em>, artist behind Blur\u2019s The Magic Whip </em></p> <p><a href=\"http://basquiat.com/\">Jean-Michel Basquiat</a>\u2019s artwork brought this great hip-hop 12in from 1983 to my attention in a record shop in Manchester. The cover is typically Basquiat. In the context of a record sleeve, he brings something unconventional, bold, playful, thought-provoking, raw and engaging while maintaining an unlaboured feel. All the surfaces \u2013 including the record labels \u2013 are something to behold, and perfectly suit the music within. Despite being 33 years old, this work feels more potent than ever, when much of our daily eyeline is bombarded with overstylised, computer-perfected, market-led noise. Armed with just a paint stick, Basquiat effortlessly cuts through it all. It\u2019s life-affirming. It reminds me I am a human being and to be a human being, to be instinctive, and that with just primitive tools, we can still make joyful and fulfilling work.</p> <h2>Joy Division \u2013 Unknown Pleasures (1979)</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f179418bc7b556a3b081289f04e484c324f8cbd1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f179418bc7b556a3b081289f04e484c324f8cbd1/0_0_1448_1449/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Joy Division \u2013 Unknown Pleasures.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><em>Chosen by </em><strong><em>Dan Hillier</em></strong><em>, winner of the 2014 Best Art Vinyl award for the cover of Royal Blood\u2019s debut album</em></p> <p>I was five or six when this came out in 1979, and didn\u2019t know anything about Joy Division, but it\u2019s one of those images that has always been about. When I was younger, I didn\u2019t know what it was or understand it, but something about the graphic always appealed. I later found out that Peter Saville\u2019s sleeve design <a href=\"http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/sa-visual/pop-culture-pulsar-origin-story-of-joy-division-s-unknown-pleasures-album-cover-video/\">depicts a frequency wave from the first known pulsar</a>, but it could equally be a landscape or depict musical frequencies. My experience of the music on records has always been influenced to some degree by the cover art, and this is dark and bleak and jagged, which is perfect for that album. After Royal Blood used my <a href=\"https://www.danhillier.com/artwork/pachamama----screen-print\">Pachamama image for their album</a>, their manager and I agreed we would have preferred not to have words on the cover. On the front of Unknown Pleasures, there\u2019s no band name or text, so no marketing or conventional enticement. It has something akin to the monolith in 2001: A Space Odyssey about it, like a communication from somewhere unknown. It\u2019s mysterious, dark and self-contained.</p> <h2>Led Zeppelin \u2013 Houses of the Holy (1973)<br></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"59f2d5ccb6ec68e9559c032db7275eee2a067004\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/59f2d5ccb6ec68e9559c032db7275eee2a067004/186_170_1995_1995/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Led Zeppelin \u2013 Houses of the Holy.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><em>Chosen by </em><strong><em>Carson Ellis</em></strong><em>, award-winning illustrator and sleeve designer for the Decemberists, Weezer and Laura Veirs</em></p> <p>This has been my favourite album cover for as long as I can remember. <a href=\"http://www.hipgnosiscovers.com/\">Hipgnosis</a> did lots of the great 70s sleeves and this is weird, timeless and iconic. I recently did a cover for an album of Zeppelin covers called From the Land of Ice and Snow and <a href=\"http://www.jealousbutcher.com/products/various\">redrew the Houses of the Holy image in my own style</a>. So I\u2019ve spent a lot of time with it. It\u2019s a photo collage image of nymph-like, mermaid-like, naked children \u2013 actually a brother and sister \u2013 climbing Giant\u2019s Causeway, in County Antrim, Northern Ireland. Zeppelin combine blues with fantasy and JRR Tolkien, and all that is on the cover. It seems to signify otherworldliness, something primal and social taboos. There\u2019s something vaguely sexualised about the children, but whatever sexuality it\u2019s alluding to is subtle enough that you can shrug it off. On <a href=\"http://decemberistsshop.com/products/what-a-terrible-world-what-a-beautiful-world-cd\">the cover of the Decemberists\u2019 What a Terrible World, What a Beautiful World</a>, I drew a stylised, flat depiction of a naked woman, with tiny pink dots for nipples. I was told that big stores wouldn\u2019t stock it. They were the most benign, non-sexual nipples that anyone ever had.</p> <h2>Miles Davis \u2013 Tutu (1986)</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3f05c46184bfe042b49e6c33f7493eaa273c9d75\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3f05c46184bfe042b49e6c33f7493eaa273c9d75/0_0_1620_1425/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Miles Davis - Tutu.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"880\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><em>Chosen by </em><a href=\"http://ceyadams.com/\"><strong><em>Cey Adams</em></strong></a><em>, designer of Def Jam Recordings sleeves from the Beastie Boys, Public Enemy and Jay Z</em></p> <p>This is one of Miles Davis\u2019s last recordings, in his avant-garde period \u2013 it\u2019s named after Archbishop Desmond Tutu. It\u2019s just a stark photograph by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2009/oct/08/irving-penn-obituary\">Irving Penn</a> of Miles looking straight on, and the edges are faded black [the cover was designed by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2012/jan/29/eiko-ishioka\">Eiko Ishioka</a>]. I was taken by the fact that an artist could have a cover without his name on it, and Miles Davis was obviously so popular that he could do that. Miles always had very powerful features, and the texture and detail in his face shows the journey of his career and how much he put into it. I was drawn to the album by that intense, beautiful stare. I modelled my career on Miles in terms of wanting to push boundaries. For example, Public Enemy\u2019s <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fear_of_a_Black_Planet#/media/File:Fear_of_a_Black_Planet.jpg\">Fear of a Black Planet</a> was conceptual art, which no one had done in hip-hop before. However, I was so moved by the Tutu cover that when the time came to do LL Cool J\u2019s greatest hits album, All World, I <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_World:_Greatest_Hits#/media/File:All_World_-_LL_Cool_J.jpg\">applied the same idea to an Albert Watson photograph of LL</a>. There was type on the front, but it was on a shinkwrap that peeled off. It was my homage to Tutu.</p> <h2>Parliament \u2013 Motor Booty Affair (1978)</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2c674e1a77eed3a51e3c91ca3d03b962d77940c9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2c674e1a77eed3a51e3c91ca3d03b962d77940c9/0_0_1092_1082/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Parliament \u2013 Motor Booty Affair.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"991\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><em>Chosen by </em><a href=\"http://josephbuckingham.com/\"><strong><em>Joe Buckingham</em></strong></a><em>, designer of various De La Soul sleeves including De La Soul Is Dead</em></p> <p>I\u2019ve always liked album sleeves that double as construction kits. I had a Jefferson Airplane album that you could take apart and build into a fully three-dimensional cigar box. The inner sleeve was an image of marijuana, and that sat in the box, so it looked as if it was filled with grass. In this field, though, this Parliament cover is king and is still my all-time favourite sleeve. It was a gatefold with a pop-up element. If you laid the album flat, this fantasy castle popped up along with various characters you could cut out and stand up in the castle. There were tons of illustrations, and the cover featured a giant bird coming down on the album\u2019s Sir Nose character. There was just so much to look at in <a href=\"http://overvision.com/\">Overton Loyd</a>\u2019s artwork. It really piqued my imagination. I think subconsciously the starkness and simplicity of the cover image against a white background seeped into how I designed <a href=\"http://typo-graphical.com/de-la-soul-is-dead/\">De La Soul Is Dead</a>.</p> <h2>Marvin Gaye \u2013 Here, My Dear (1978)</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0df8e872e3e7a8024a1cebf7a4b823cb289a914e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0df8e872e3e7a8024a1cebf7a4b823cb289a914e/0_0_1024_1024/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Marvin Gaye \u2013 Here, My Dear.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><em>Chosen by </em><a href=\"http://mrscottdesign.com/\"><strong><em>Scott Sandler</em></strong></a><em>, Grammy-nominated designer of artwork for everyone from Def Jam to Lil Wayne to the Rolling Stones </em></p> <p>I love this because of the story behind it and the way the cover works with the music. In the mid-70s, Marvin Gaye had had two enormous albums in What\u2019s Going On and Let\u2019s Get It On, but was going through an acrimonious divorce from Anna Gordy. They agreed a deal whereby she wouldn\u2019t get any money, but would get all the proceeds of his next album, which looked guaranteed to be the biggest record ever. Instead, he sabotaged the deal by making a wilfully uncommercial album, full of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQ74DQ-HWxQ\">songs about their relationship</a>, although it\u2019s now seen as another classic. Gaye gave Michael Bryan, the artist, very specific instructions, so the cover features the singer looking like a Greek god. The artwork includes the words \u201clove and marriage\u201d and \u201cjudgment\u201d and it unfolds to a picture of him handing her this itsy-bitsy, teeny-tiny record. That\u2019s dark, but mostly a record just features a photo of the band. This is a total concept, a snapshot of his state of mind and an amazing art piece.</p> <h2>U2 \u2013 Boy (1980)</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"09b2e0fe7044ce6da1c7a9ea73e897be2f7403df\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/09b2e0fe7044ce6da1c7a9ea73e897be2f7403df/0_0_1398_1380/1000.jpg\" alt=\"U2 \u2013 Boy.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"987\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><em>Chosen by </em><strong><em>Alison Fielding</em></strong><em>, Beggars Banquet Group creative director, who has designed for the Prodigy, the Specials and the Horrors</em></p> <p>When I was about 13, I heard <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2BqLlVHlWA\">I Will Follow</a> when I was listening to the John Peel show on headphones. I thought it was amazing, and immediately went to this little local shop that sold TVs as well as records, and ordered it. At that point, I had no idea what it would look like. When I got it, I just thought it was so beautiful, I stared at it for hours. I don\u2019t care much for the graphics, but it\u2019s very evocative of a time in my life that shaped my love of music, and there\u2019s something almost Mona Lisa-like about the photograph on the sleeve. Does it capture innocence, or something darker? They <a href=\"http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/music-arts/child-appeared-u2-album-covers-boy-war-grown-31-years-article-1.964294\">used the same boy two albums later for War</a>, by which point he has a split lip. So there\u2019s a narrative developing. When I was about 13 or 14, I had this big blue Adidas bag for school, and I wrote \u201cU2\u201d on it in really big lettering in ballpoint pen, but messily and badly. That was my first attempt at graphics.</p> <h2>Bj\u00f6rk \u2013 Homogenic (1997)</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0464af4f6342187a7c71647e7ca405f79f818b81\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0464af4f6342187a7c71647e7ca405f79f818b81/0_0_1404_1404/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Bjork - Homogenic.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><em>Chosen by </em><strong><em>Rochelle Nembhard</em></strong><em>, who worked on the acclaimed cover for Petite Noir\u2019s La Vie Est Belle</em></p> <p>I like covers that relate directly to the musician, more than abstract images. I like some abstract images, but those covers could be anyone. Homogenic is a piece of art, and the fact that she used Alexander McQueen to design it was amazing. It\u2019s a fusion between African and Asian \u2013 the African necklaces and the Asian dress \u2013 that stands the test of time. I love all Bj\u00f6rk\u2019s covers for that reason \u2013 they all show an aspect of her. The visual aspect of music, the album cover, is important, because it is a picture of the music, depicting the sound. It should be so much more than just a one-dimensional image \u2013 it has to be the face of the music. That\u2019s what I was trying to do <a href=\"http://cdn4.pitchfork.com/albums/22275/306b06ea.jpg\">with Petite Noir, working with the artist Lina Viktor</a>. I knew she had the type of imagery that would translate into his music and stand the test of time.</p> <h2>Scritti Politti \u2013 Work in Progress EP (1979)</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"771081b9179d29bc579fc0ac68f6d9af5741c9fd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/771081b9179d29bc579fc0ac68f6d9af5741c9fd/0_0_2402_2329/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Scritti Politti \u2013 Work in Progress.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"970\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><em>Chosen by </em><strong><em>Matthew Cooper</em></strong><em>, </em><em>designer for Arctic Monkeys, Franz Ferdinand, Hot Chip and many more</em></p> <p>I love the DIY aesthetic of the <a href=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/5/51/Elvispresleydebutalbum.jpeg\">first edition of Elvis Presley\u2019s first album</a>, later homaged by <a href=\"http://www.raylowry.com/\">Ray Lowry for the Clash\u2019s London Calling</a> sleeve. The wonky type looks like it has been cut out and stuck on by hand. There\u2019s another musician awkwardly cropped in the photo of Elvis. Nowadays, the record company would ask you to Photoshop him out. The immediacy of the image and graphics make a statement of intent: \u201cHere I am.\u201d Many years and genres after that was released, the same aesthetic inspired me when I came across this EP of Scritti Politti\u2019s second John Peel session in Chick-A-Boom Records in Sutton Market, some years after it came out in 1979 on Rough Trade Records. The sleeve was just a plastic bag with two bits of photocopied paper in it. One of them listed the entire costs of making the record, including \u00a365 for 5,000 plastic covers. The other photocopy was of a bag of crisps, a badge and some sugar. It demystified the entire process and I realised that I could do something similar at the local library. So I took loads of stuff down and started photocopying it.</p> <ul> <li>This piece was amended on 23 September to correct the spelling of Malcolm Garrett\u2019s name.</li> </ul>",
  "<p>If there is one thing clear about the current NBA, it is that it is no longer the league of David Stern. As a businessman, the league\u2019s former commissioner was a visionary, building a booming operation that now reaches around the globe. But on social issues he stumbled, creating policies that almost seemed designed to make a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_and_ethnicity_in_the_NBA\">league of mostly African American players</a> appear palatable to a white audience.</p> <p>It was Stern, after all, who 11 years ago created professional sports\u2019 first&#xa0;<a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nba/news/story?id=2195141\">sideline dress code</a>&#xa0;that he called \u201cbusiness casual\u201d. It came at a time when a phrase thrown around the league was \u201cmiddle-class values,\u201d which was basically code for \u201cwhite values\u201d. And while many of those using these words would never consider themselves to be tone deaf to the struggles of people of color, their zeal to keep the money machine going clouded a deeper social understanding.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/sep/20/colin-kaepernick-death-threats-national-anthem-protest-nfl\">Colin Kaepernick on death threats: if I'm killed 'you've proved my point'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Who knows how Stern would have handled <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2016/sep/16/colin-kaepernick-protest-racial-iniquity-nfl-american-football\">today\u2019s climate of athlete activism</a>.&#xa0;Perhaps he would have embraced <a href=\"http://fortune.com/2016/07/14/espys-gun-violence-lebron-james/\">the actions</a> of players such as Carmelo Anthony, LeBron James, Dwyane Wade and Chris Paul. Times are different and Black Lives Matter has given many sports stars a voice they lacked a decade ago. But the current commissioner, Adam Silver, does appear to understand his players. The culture that he is creating around the NBA is one of tolerance and openness rather than catering to white corporate interests. A glimpse into his thinking came early in his tenure when he moved quickly to force out Los Angeles Clippers owner Donald Sterling after Sterling was recorded making racist comments. There was&#xa0;<a href=\"http://sports.yahoo.com/news/how-nba-could-deliver-knockout-blow-to-donald-sterling-093958859.html\">a strong sense around the NBA</a>&#xa0;that Stern would not have done the same.</p> <p>Now the first sports league to introduce business casual has become the first pro sports league to open a conversation with their players about issues such as police shootings and racial inequality. On Wednesday the NBA and NBA Players Association&#xa0;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/MarcJSpearsESPN/status/778783820405354496\">sent a letter&#xa0;</a>to their players saying they want a discussion about the problems raised by Anthony, James, Wade <a href=\"http://fortune.com/2016/07/14/espys-gun-violence-lebron-james/\">at the ESPYs this summer</a>.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/sep/21/nfl-players-reactions-national-anthem-protest-richard-sherman-colin-kaepernick\">Richard Sherman on anthem protests: 'People are still missing the point'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cThe league and players association, working together have begun developing substantive ways for us to come together and take meaningful action,\u201d the letter signed by Silver and players association president Michele Roberts said. \u201cThese ideas are based on the actions many of you have already taken or supported, including convening community conversations in NBA markets to engage young people, parents, community leaders and law enforcement in a candid dialogue, using our game to bring people together and build bonds of trust in our communities; and supporting mentoring and career development programs that help bring economic opportunity to young people of color.\u201d</p> <p>Rather than passively tolerate the protests of their players the way the NFL has done with the movement started by Colin Kaepernick, or condemning them as US Soccer <a href=\"http://www.oregonlive.com/fifa-world-cup/index.ssf/2016/09/us_soccer_disapproves_of_megan.html#incart_river_index\">has done with Megan Rapinoe</a>, the NBA is welcoming the discussion. And while the league\u2019s decision is undoubtedly influenced by the fact that many of the NBA\u2019s players will favor some form of dissent during the anthem, Silver is drawing a blueprint for other commissioners and association heads to follow.</p> <p>For too long the leaders of sports leagues have run from the uncomfortable voice of protest, fearful of upsetting advertisers. Harebrained edicts like business casual and <a href=\"http://www.drcarlhart.com/unsportsmanlike-conduct-nfls-pot-policy-is-out-of-line/\">the NFL player conduct policy</a> were born from the terror that non-white players were out-of-control and therefore alarming sponsors. Instead of hiding from a revolution Silver is searching for ways his league can be part of the solution to real problems.</p> <p>Last week, <a href=\"http://aaas.duke.edu/people?Gurl=%2Faas%2FAAAS&amp;Uid=3851&amp;subpage=profile\">Mark Anthony Neal</a>, a professor of African and African American studies at Duke University, told the Guardian that <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/college-football/story/_/id/14078494/missouri-tigers-football-players-strike-embattled-tim-wolfe-resigns\">last year\u2019s strike by Missouri football players</a> \u2013 which resulted in the resignation of the school\u2019s president \u2013 has given athletes a new power. They realize they can make change with their celebrity. Why wouldn\u2019t a sports league want to aid their players in raising awareness? US sports organizations should be leaping at the opportunity to showcase their athletes as intelligent, caring people and not just magnificently-conditioned robots carrying out their coaches\u2019 game plan.</p> <p>Back when he invented business casual, Stern mocked the players who objected, directing an especially-pointed dig at the Denver Nuggets Marcus Camby, who had suggested that if the commissioner wanted his players dressed a certain way the league should provide a clothing stipend.</p> <p>\u201cWe don\u2019t know where the cutoff is \u2013 maybe if you earn less than $8m you\u2019ll get a scholarship from the commissioner,\u201d <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nba/news/story?id=2195141\">Stern said at the time.</a></p> <p>The NBA has moved a long way in 11 years.

  "<p>This week, <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-nottinghamshire-36775398\">Nottingham Women\u2019s Centre and Nottinghamshire Police held an event</a> to share some of the outcomes of their much-discussed new policy of recording misogyny as a hate crime. The event was packed with 150 attendees, including representatives from 16 police forces across the UK \u2013 testament to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/sep/10/misogyny-hate-crime-nottingham-police-crackdown\">huge interest surrounding the scheme</a> and the appetite to consider rolling it out further afield. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.nottinghamshire.police.uk/profile/susannah-fish\">Sue Fish</a>, chief constable of Nottinghamshire Police, and Melanie Jeffs, manager of the Nottingham Women\u2019s Centre, shared some early results, as well as highlighting the valuable lessons learned about the problem itself and the best practice for tackling it. Here are some of the insights they revealed.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/sep/10/misogyny-hate-crime-nottingham-police-crackdown\">Police in England and Wales consider making misogyny a hate crime</a> </p> </aside>  <h2>Women aren\u2019t clamouring to report wolf-whistles</h2> <p>Contrary to some rather reactionary early headlines, the decision to record misogyny as a hate crime did not lead to a frenzy of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jul/14/wolf-whistling-hate-crime-misogyny-nottinghamshire-police\">women calling for men to be locked up for a single wolf-whistle</a>. In reality, the 30 misogynistic hate crimes recorded by police since the new category was introduced ranged from public order offences to physical assault, indecent assault and even kidnapping. Nor were the police inundated with thousands of reports. \u201cSadly,\u201d Fish explained, \u201cas with so much hate crime, we only get the tip of the iceberg reported to us.\u201d</p> <h2>Serious crimes are seen as \u2018normal\u2019 and so go unreported</h2> <p>Recording misogyny as a hate crime doesn\u2019t change what is already a crime under UK law, but it does seem to have a major impact on women\u2019s perceptions of what they can report. <a href=\"http://www.endviolenceagainstwomen.org.uk/news/234/85-of-younger-women-in-uk-have-been-sexually-harassed-in-public\">A YouGov poll</a> in March this year revealed that more than a third of women had experienced \u201cunwanted sexual touching\u201d in public spaces, but many feel unable to report such experiences. </p> <p>Nottingham women whose video testimonies were played at the event said the new hate crime category gave them confidence the problem was finally being taken seriously. Many might not have come forward before, even to report a serious offence, because it is so normalised. One woman initially told Jeffs: \u201cThere must be a different number to call [than the standard police numbers], because this isn\u2019t a crime.\u201d</p> <h2>The problem is intersectional</h2> <p>Many of those local women\u2019s experiences revealed the intersection of misogyny with other forms of prejudice, notably Islamophobia, with one woman being told by a man in the street that she\u2019d look much better \u201cwithout that thing on your head\u201d. The crimes recorded by the police during the initial reporting period also revealed these intersections; they included women\u2019s experiences of \u201cracially or religiously aggravated public fear, alarm or distress\u201d.</p> <h2>The backlash is brutal (and proves the importance of the work)</h2> <p>Intense international media coverage of the new policy came as something of a surprise, with headlines from as far afield as China, the Middle East and the US, including some more colourful than others. (\u201c<a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.thefrisky.com/2016-09-14/british-county-names-street-harassment-a-hate-crime-in-tough-blow-to-local-perverts\">British county names street harassment a hate crime in tough blow to local perverts</a>.\u201d) But while they had expected some negative responses, nothing prepared the women who spearheaded the initiative for the <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-nottinghamshire-36943676\">deluge of social media abuse</a>, ironically, from those angered by the idea that misogyny should be considered a hate crime. </p> <p>Fish advised that any similar future work should include built-in strategies from the beginning to provide support in dealing with online abuse.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"b8b0b9b46bac3a013300068d3af0084dfea95ef0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b8b0b9b46bac3a013300068d3af0084dfea95ef0/1069_631_2036_2036/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A female police officer on the street\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">All frontline staff need training to help deal with reports of harassment.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bloomberg via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p></p> <h2>Thorough training is vital</h2> <p>Any successful scheme must acknowledge the negative experiences many, in particular black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) women and LGBTQ people, have had with reporting to the police. This comes on top of the societal normalisation that makes many reluctant to report sexual harassment for fear of being mocked, dismissed or disbelieved. Women \u201cthought they\u2019d be laughed at when they phoned up to report\u201d, said Fish. So training for all frontline staff, from despatch operators to responding officers, is vital before any public-facing work begins, in order to guarantee a respectful, appropriate response to every report.</p> <h2>Community co-operation is vital</h2> <p>A key feature of Nottingham\u2019s approach was close collaboration between the police and the local women\u2019s centre. This also facilitated the provision of support to victims after they had come forward. Jeffs spoke of the cooperation that had been fostered with local communities, schools, churches, mosques and other organisations such as mental health charities. In order to be successful, she said, a whole-community approach is important. </p> <p>Ultimately she stressed that the aim is to change attitudes, challenge the normalisation of misogynistic abuse, and enable women to move freely around their city without being intimidated, abused or harassed. \u201cYou can\u2019t measure the success of this by the number of calls, but by the number of women who\u2019ve said they feel like they\u2019re walking taller \u2013 just to know it\u2019s there.\u201d</p> <p>Finally, the work can\u2019t simply be a one-off push \u2013 it must be sustainable and ongoing. As Fish said: \u201cIt\u2019s not a pilot or an initiative or a trial. We\u2019ve listened to women and we\u2019re doing it.\u201d </p>",

Chris Wright replaced Barker from the Pavilion End and, in a match littered with lbws and bowleds, produced a rare caught behind when Karl Brown feathered one. Haseeb Hameed has looked pretty unflustered at the other end from the carnage and will resume on 11 in the morning alongside Simon Kerrigan. </p> <p>Meanwhile, at Lord\u2019s, Middlesex are 53 for 2, having been 2 for 2 at one stage, but still trail Yorkshire by 67.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57e4051ae4b052c716b30e03\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/paulweaver\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-22T16:22:59.560Z\">5.22pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Hampshire have lost two more wickets.

Their batsmen have shown urgency, rattling along at five an over or so. But unfortunately they have also lost wickets.

But rather than play it out he tried to hit the spinner out of the ground, missed, and was promptly given out lbw by the umpire Nick Cook.</p> <p>A sheepish looking Rushworth darted off to the pavilion. Richardson, who had played superbly, waved his arm in anger and frustration. Then, instead of leaving the crease and following all the other players back to the dressing room, he remained there, in stupefied disbelief. The Hampshire players had to go back to the pitch to congratulate him. Very funny. Rushworth\u2019s stroke was one of the daftest I have ever seen. Maybe Richardson will report him to his father, Dave Richardson, the chief executive of the International Cricket Council, in the hope that some special punishment might be found.

Bell, who had been so fluent before the interval, got bogged down a bit and perished for 31, playing his late cut, with the otherwise costly Jordan Clark the man to bowl him. Hain in contrast had looked to be continuing the form from the first innings that brought him the solitary half-century of the match so far, stroking six fours.

But Carney\u2019s comments in a speech in Berlin offer little enlightenment on that subject, being more concerned with green financing. Katie Allen reports:</p> <blockquote> <p>Bank of England governor Mark Carney has thrown his weight behind taking the fledgling market in green investments mainstream to help cut carbon emissions and boost global economic growth at the same time.</p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p>Carney used a speech in Berlin on Thursday to highlight green finance as an opportunity to boost financial stability while also tackling climate change.</p> <p>He made no reference to the Bank\u2019s current stance on interest rates in the UK, which were cut to a record low last month to shore up the post-referendum economy. But Carney did discuss the global picture of low interest rates and how more investment in green technologies and and projects to cut emissions could help raise interest rates.</p> <p>\u201cThe Bank of England has long stressed that central bank policies are not the cause of low rates but responses to them. We are actors in a play written by others,\u201d Carney said in his Arthur Burns memorial lecture in the German capital.</p> <p>That was because the level at which interest rates must ultimately settle to ensure steady inflation \u2013 the \u201cequilibrium\u201d interest rate - was determined by fundamental factors driving savings and investment in the global economy, he said. Those factors included technology, demographics and inequality.</p> <p>Reprising his own recent comments and those of other central bankers, Carney stressed that monetary policy alone could not address the world\u2019s economic problems.</p> <p>\u201cLong-run prosperity was never in the gift of monetary policy makers. As the 10th anniversary of the start of the crisis approaches, a consensus is growing that escaping this low-growth low-inflation trap will require a rebalancing between monetary, fiscal and structural policies,\u201d Carney said.</p> </blockquote> <p><em>On that note, it\u2019s time to close for the day.

The cuts, part of reforms demanded by international lenders, have been branded \u201ctotally illegal\u201d by seamen who are likely to continue the industrial action in the months ahead. </p> <p>The walk-out came as anarchists also turned up the heat on the leftist-led government, rowdily occupying the offices of public transport ticket inspectors at the transport ministry.

  "<p>The horrors of a haunted house usually end once you push open the final set of black, saloon-hinged doors and step back in the fairground.

Creative Time\u2019s artistic director, <a href=\"http://creativetime.org/about/staff/nato-thompson/\">Nato Thompson</a>, describes the venture as \u201cHieronymus Bosch meets Fox News.

Nevertheless the artist \u2013 who has previously staged a fine-art version of <a href=\"http://camstl.org/about-pedro-reyes-and-sanatorium/\">a psychiatric sanatorium at different galleries around the world</a> and overseen <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/2014/01/25/265794611/artist-transforms-guns-to-make-music-literally\">a programme to repurpose firearms as musical instruments</a> \u2013 is deeply serious in his examination of fear within today\u2019s political landscape.</p> <p>\u201cThese days, politicians are trying to create fear in order to take power,\u201d Reyes says, \u201cso it\u2019s quite an experiment to be dealing with the production of fear and its political uses.\u201d</p> <p>He is also highly respectful of the funhouse trope, partly because it is so familiar to people who might not necessarily be avid gallery goers.</p> <p>\u201cPretty much everyone can picture a horror house,\u201d he says. \u201cIt will, if you forgive the paradox, deal with political issues in a very democratic way. Everyone can engage with the form.\u201d</p> <p>Reyes and Thompson are keen to ensure Doomocracy keeps pace with events and have been writing and rewriting the dramatic scenarios to reflect the changing nature of the electoral race.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ve been workshopping the scripts today,\u201d says Thompson. \u201cIt\u2019s a fluid process. The ground is moving fast this election, it\u2019s hard to keep up.\u201d</p> <p>Reyes, who visited both commercial haunted houses and guerrilla theatre groups in preparation for the show, also says Doomocracy reflects a general hopelessness within contemporary politics, both in the US and elsewhere.</p> <p>\u201cWhy do people vote against their own interests?\u201d Reyes says. \u201cIs it that we have brainwashed people to make the wrong decisions? There\u2019s a feeling in the US that it\u2019s a downer to have to choose between the [presidential] options. But it\u2019s elsewhere too; it can be said of Mexico and many other places around the world. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/eu-referendum\">Brexit</a> was almost like a democratic, rightwing coup d\u2019\u00e9tat.\u201d</p> <p>Despite this gloomy view, Doomocracy is still able to engage with some of the norms of campaign fundraising. Its <a href=\"https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/2026016011/doomocracy-a-haunted-house-with-pedro-reyes-and-cr\">Kickstarter page</a> looks set to reach its goal of $80,000 by its deadline of 29 September, offering suitably doom-laden swag for its pledgers, including Doomocracy pennants and buttons, and \u201cYes We Can\u2019t\u201d bumper stickers.</p> <p>With all this left-leaning pessimism, Reyes\u2019 haunted house looks unlikely to attract many Trump voters. However, Creative Time\u2019s executive director, Katie Hollander, argues that the work doesn\u2019t favour either side. \u201cIt\u2019s not a commentary on the candidates, more a commentary on the issues,\u201d she says.</p> <p>Indeed, Reyes hopes to take in wider political issues unlikely to be addressed by either party this election year. \u201cIt will deal with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/may/27/-sp-americas-mental-health-care-system-crisis\">mental health</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2014/feb/03/us-war-on-drugs-impact-in-latin-american\">excessive criminalisation of drug use</a>, and the increasing role of the medical industry as a kind of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/cifamerica/2011/jun/20/healthcare-drugspolicy\">white-collar drug dealer</a>,\u201d the artist says. \u201cThere\u2019ll be stuff on the food industry too, and equity or the lack of social mobility \u2013 those universal issues, that are experienced in every part of the world.\u201d</p> <p>While this all may sound nihilistic, Reyes hopes Doomocracy could be liberating too. \u201cUsually my art is more about hope, but on this occasion it is a dark project, and offers more of a space for catharsis,\u201d he says. \u201cAfter all, Halloween is a moment to go crazy. That is the role of carnival.\u201d</p> <p>Yet, does he genuinely expect Doomocracy to actually change any visitors\u2019 minds about the issues examined? Won\u2019t most already agree with his position on, say, pharmaceuticals and gun crime?</p> <p>\u201cThere will be people who love it, people who hate it, people who feel empowered, and people who feel offended,\u201d says Reyes. \u201cMaking art is one way to elaborate and engage with reality.\u201d</p> <p>And this autumn, at a time when truth seems if not stranger, then at least as spooky as fiction, one route for meaningful political engagement appears to lie through Doomocracy\u2019s funhouse doors.</p>",
  "<p>Instagram is one of those modern day inventions that nobody knew they wanted until it was there.

  "<p>On this day in 1930, the Mother Superior of the <a href=\"http://www.ssnd.org/\">School Sisters of Notre Dame</a> in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, sent a letter asking every member of the sisterhood to write an autobiography. She offered few further instructions, and so left it up to each member of the<strong> </strong>order to decide how to describe the most important episodes of their lives. Some nuns chose to insert emotional details about how their experiences had affected them. Others recounted only bald facts.</p> <p>Seven decades later, researchers at the University of Kentucky found that these differences were strong predictors of how long the 180 nuns <a href=\"http://www.apa.org/pubs/journals/releases/psp805804.pdf\">in their study</a> lived. The more the sisters couched their accounts of personal responses to major life events in positivity, the greater their longevity.</p> <p>The great benefit of studying nuns is that on all the common lifestyle factors that tend to affect longevity \u2013 living conditions, access to health care, marriage (or lack of it) \u2013 nuns live virtually identical lives to one another. The autobiographies were written when the Notre Dame sisters were around 22 years old. So this study suggests that enduring tendencies and coping mechanisms, when extended throughout our adult lives, matter substantially for health and lifespan.</p> <p>These days, psychologists have reached a consensus on a more thorough way to measure personality than merely degree of positivity: they score individuals along five dimensions.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/sep/20/chromium-6-erin-brockovich-chemical-threatens-two-thirds-of-americans-erin-brockovich\">Chromium-6: 'Erin Brockovich' chemical threatens two-thirds of Americans</a> </p> </aside>  <p>These dimensions, known as the Big Five, are each continuums: from pure introversion to exaggerated extraversion, for example, or neurotic nervousness to complete confidence. Together the Big Five compose the acronym Ocean \u2013openness to experience, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness and neuroticism (or emotional stability) \u2013 and are typically assessed using a <a href=\"http://www.truity.com/test/big-five-personality-test\">questionnaire</a>. Over time, researchers have come to realize that personality is at least as good at predicting longevity as <a href=\"http://projects.ori.org/lrg/PDFs_papers/Roberts_etal_2007_Power_of_personality_PPS.pdf\">socioeconomic status</a>.</p> <p>That may sound implausible, but records of 1,500 Hawaiian students illustrate how personality types can play out. In the early 1960s, some elementary school teachers in Hawaii were asked to assess each member of their young class for the Big Five dimensions.</p> <p>Forty years down the line, early childhood scores for a few of these dimensions <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16448298\">correlated strongly</a> with a roster of risk factors for chronic illness: smoking, alcohol consumption, and excessive body mass among them.</p> <p>For both sexes, the more conscientious elementary schoolers were the ones who grew into healthy adults at middle age.</p> <p>For women only, smoking in one\u2019s 40s was associated with low agreeableness (or conformity) scores in elementary school \u2013 perhaps, the study authors suggest, because these women became hooked on nicotine when smoking was considered a more rebellious behavior for women than it was for men.</p> <p>Conscientiousness is undoubtedly the personality trait that matters most for longevity. It is also a remarkably <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21859226\">stable</a> trait across whole lifetimes. The direct health benefits of being an orderly, goal-directed person, able to control your impulses, are intuitive: not only do they mean you are psychologically equipped to resist a second slice of cake, but also that you do a good job of adhering to a doctor\u2019s advice when you get sick.</p> <p>Conscientiousness is what separates <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20109519\">Sardinians</a> with lots of \u201cgood cholesterol\u201d from those with too much \u201cbad cholesterol\u201d; it is what predicts which patients with poorly functioning <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12090673\">kidneys</a> are going to snuff it first.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/sep/07/microfiber-pollution-ocean-advocacy-groups-alliance\">Leading ocean advocacy groups join forces to tackle microfiber pollution</a> </p> </aside>  <p>There are indirect advantages to conscientiousness, too. It is an excellent predictor of college GPA, even when the influence of high school SAT scores is <a href=\"http://psychology.okstate.edu/faculty/jgrice/psyc4333/FiveFactor_GPA_JPSP.pdf\">removed using statistics</a>. As a result, the conscientious tend to get better jobs, and in turn, better healthcare. The overall medical advantages that stem from conscientiousness are so substantial that possible methods to instill the trait have been put forward as <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23106844\">public health policies</a>, and medical researchers have called for measures of conscientiousness to be included in patient records.</p> <p>For the remaining Big Five, the relationship with lifespan is less straightforward. Neuroticism implies never waiting long to see a doctor about a niggling medical worry, although \u2013 and unlike the long-lived nuns \u2013 a tendency towards low mood and poor ability to manage life\u2019s stressors. Extroverts are probably good at seeking support when they need it, but they can be drawn into risky behaviors.</p> <p>For agreeable people, the world is a more trustworthy place, and so they often enjoy high quality personal relationships. Yet in their obedience, the agreeable can do things they may later regret. (For example, agreeable people were especially willing to deliver a high-voltage electric shock in a <a href=\"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jopy.12104/abstract\">Milgram-like experiment</a>.) The fifth member of the Big Five, openness (aka creativity), can also be good or bad for health, depending on what exactly it is that an open person seeks to explore.</p> <p>To clarify the health impacts of these conflicting influences, groups of Big Five researchers<strong> </strong>have mushroomed all over the world, with the intention of figuring out the common personality traits among longevity\u2019s high achievers: the world\u2019s centenarians. These scholars have accessed of personalities of people over 100 years of age living in <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3259156/\">Tokyo</a>, Sweden, and the southern state of <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3259159/\">Georgia</a>, among other places. In <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25108617\">Australia</a>, researchers used one-hundredth birthday letters from Queen Elizabeth II as proof of age.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/aug/31/new-york-city-deaths-chief-medical-examiner-job\">Brains and bone saws: a day with the chief medical examiner of New York City</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Although not all centenarian studies have found the same results, generally, people who make it to very old age are predominantly emotional stable (ie non-neurotic) extroverts \u2013 in addition to being highly conscientious. In Baltimore, researchers studying the elderly calculated exactly how much this combination of traits contributed to survival. Having scores for extraversion and conscientiousness one standard deviation above average, and a score for neuroticism one standard deviation below average, adds two or three more years of life, they <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2505356/\">report</a>.</p> <p>Like the sisters of Notre Dame \u2013 many of whom wrote their autobiographies from a convent in Baltimore \u2013 these retirees were blessed with the intrinsic skills to navigate what life threw at them with aplomb. Their lesson to the unconscientious, to the natural introverts and hypochondriac wallowers out there, is to recognize how your own behavioral tendencies could be impacting your health, and take steps to address them. One day, your life may depend on it.</p>",
  "<p>When a cable or streaming show is widely lauded for innovation, it\u2019s a fair bet that broadcast network imitators won\u2019t be far behind: for every Mad Men, the TV development process will produce three derivative Pan Ams. Fall 2016 has taken that trend to its natural conclusion, revivifying the corpses of old film and TV franchises and turning them into the least-wanted zombies since Fear the Walking Dead. </p> <p>TV is no stranger to adaptation, of course, from Syfy\u2019s The Magicians to FX\u2019s Fargo but the biggest shock of the fall is that these shows aren\u2019t half bad. Take Fox\u2019s The Exorcist, a pilot that takes the viewer\u2019s uneasy feelings about an Exorcist TV show and incorporates them into its generally effective mood of discomfort and creeping horror. Like the little-watched, uninspired Omen series <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2016/mar/08/lucifer-damien-a-and-e-tv-devil\">Damien</a>, The Exorcist takes its cues from the idea of legacy, rather than a straight-up reboot, The Exorcist is a sequel of sorts. (Series protagonist Father Tomas, ably played by Sense8\u2019s Alfonso Herrera, encounters news clippings describing the events of the film.) But where Damien is almost entirely about its relationship to The Omen and suffers accordingly, The Exorcist uses its forebear to establish the ground rules of its world without too much fanfare: there are demons here, and it will cost something to send them away.</p> <p>The notion of cost is anathema to Fox\u2019s other surprisingly successful adaptation of a beloved film: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/sep/21/lethal-weapon-remake-loud-ludicrous-loveable\">Lethal Weapon</a>. Against all odds, this show is incredibly endearing, and even if it\u2019s not going to make many hardcore fans, it still seems likely to prove consistently entertaining. Lethal Weapon, for all its obvious stupidity (and it\u2019s pretty obvious \u2013 in the pilot alone, Murtaugh and Riggs foil a bank robbery with pizza, blow up a car, and practically skip chasing mobsters around a shady warehouse), is very fun, like something that would have been on USA before the gloominess of Mr Robot. Beyond the fun, easy chemistry between Clayne Crawford\u2019s demented Riggs and Damon Wayans\u2019 not-yet-too-old-for-this-shit Murtaugh, Lethal Weapon is good because it\u2019s a loving self parody: these characters don\u2019t have the fate of the world in their hands, they just want to goof around and solve some crimes.</p> <p>CBS\u2019s reboot of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/jul/07/macgyver-all-american-hero-assassin\">MacGyver</a> is, in some places, shooting for the same vibe as Lethal Weapon, particularly in the helpful pieces of text that show up to label things like \u201celectronics\u201d that Angus needs to use to construct gadgets. Sadly, MacGyver is atrociously bad, a disaster that is all the more tragic for how uninteresting it is. There are several moments of attempted updates to the premise (including extremely poor attempts to integrate a disjointed group of operatives into the global security apparatus), but MacGyver remains steadfastly traditional in its revolting attitude toward women, first appearing to fridge a character before turning her into the demonic embodiment of womanly charms.</p> <p>MacGyver\u2019s casual male chauvinism is worth noting primarily because it\u2019s basically the only thing about the show that raises an interesting question about the current crop of TV remakes. What does it mean to repurpose an older property that was designed to exist in a cultural moment that was far less aware of the ghosts of sexism, racism and all other forms of systemic injustice haunting writers\u2019 rooms \u2013 especially now, when a TV show\u2019s expression of values comes, almost inevitably, under <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/apr/19/unbreakable-kimmy-schmidt-pc-culture-tina-fey-south-park\">intense scrutiny</a>?</p> <p>The Exorcist and Lethal Weapon succeed, in large part, by actively ignoring these questions \u2013 or, more specifically, explicitly creating a space where they don\u2019t need to be asked. The pleasures of each show are visceral and generic, almost by design. Herrera is charmingly naive as Father Tomas, and though Ben Daniels doesn\u2019t get a ton to do as the tortured older priest Father Marcus, the two have enough chemistry to suggest that watching them fight demons will, in fact, be fun. Likewise, Lethal Weapon\u2019s new Murtaugh and Riggs exist purely to please an audience, bouncing off their captain, played by Kevin Rahm (Mad Men\u2019s Ted Chaough). </p> <p>The falsest notes in these series are, unsurprisingly, the ones that feel the most like network notes on an \u201cupdated\u201d version of a beloved property: Murtaugh has an Apple watch that tracks his heart rate, and he and Riggs deploy goofy detective methods that wouldn\u2019t be out of place in the \u201czoom and enhance\u201d lab on CSI. But they exist as purely cosmetic changes, allowing The Exorcist and Lethal Weapon to understand what made their originals successful (disturbing horror and a strong buddy cop dynamic, respectively). The important thing for this kind of remake, then, is \u2013 surprise! \u2013 basic storytelling, and a good storyteller knows how to avoid distracting the audience with, say, bland characters and unnecessary sexism. Even in 2016, narrative competence is the ultimate Lethal Weapon.</p>",
  "<p>Meet the Issawis. They are from Falluja. </p> <p>At least, they were.<br></p> <p>Once, it was a peaceful city, home to close-knit families, government employees and businessmen, dusty in the summer, cool in winter, unremarkable in many ways with its date palms and fruit tree groves, many mosques and low-rise homes.</p> <p>\u201cLife was easy and beautiful,\u201d recalls Reema al-Issawi, one of an extended family of at least 40 people \u2013 brothers and sisters, aunts and uncles, cousins and grandparents \u2013 who lived for generations in the city 40 miles (65km) west of Baghdad. </p> <p>Locals would sit on the banks of the Habbaniyah lake or lose themselves in the groves and plantations, settled lives for the 300,000-odd people living on the doorstep of one of the Arab world\u2019s great capitals.</p> <p>\u201cI had many houses to move between, my uncles\u2019 and aunts\u2019 houses; they were built close to each other,\u201d says Reema. \u201cThere was not any worry about income or security, and if any problem took place, the sheikhs would meet to sort it out quickly.\u201d </p> <p>All that changed, as so much does, with war. Despite strong competition, there is perhaps no other Iraqi city that has become as synonymous with the catastrophe of conflict as Falluja.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"df8b59ca6f4b04aea8accddb53dd77903461c626\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/df8b59ca6f4b04aea8accddb53dd77903461c626/0_0_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Damage in Falluja\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Damage in Falluja, known as the \u2018city of mosques\u2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Staff/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Since 2004, the Issawis have abandoned their homes not once, but on at least five occasions, during which the enemy was first the Americans, then the Iraqi government and then Islamic State (Isis) before the militants were finally driven from the city this summer. <br></p> <p>Issawi men have been shot, killed in air attacks or forcefully disappeared. The women \u2013 three generations of them \u2013 have become used to the dusty drag with its dangerous checkpoints that leads to Baghdad. </p> <p>And the children? They have grown up knowing peace to be a fleeting concept that can vanish overnight, along with their home, and the people in it. </p> <p>\u201cThe children are confused and they ask about their dads most of the time,\u201d says Reema. \u201cThe game they always play after paying a visit to their dad\u2019s grave is how to stretch your body on the floor like a dead man.\u201d</p> <p>Now, with locals starting to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/19/iraq-families-return-falluja-isis-free\">drift back to their obliterated city</a>, the Issawis (those that are left) are facing a choice: return to ruined houses and risk another frantic exodus further down the road. Or forget their city forever.</p> <h2>1991<br></h2> <p>Coalition bombs are raining down on the \u201ccity of mosques\u201d. <br></p> <p>Its proximity to the Iraqi capital means Falluja and its predominantly Sunni population are hit hard as US-led forces slap down Saddam Hussein\u2019s invasion of Kuwait in the first Gulf war. About 200 civilians are killed when bombs targeted at the city\u2019s bridge over the Euphrates fall on crowded marketplaces.</p> <p>For Reema at least, there is something to be happy about: she is getting married. And escaping.</p> <p>Her husband-to-be, Ibrahim, a cousin on her mother\u2019s side, lives in a big house in Baghdad with his family. The distance between the two cities is small, but the change in Reema\u2019s life is great. She leaves behind her home \u2013 its clean streets, its generous inhabitants, its shops laden with cheap, locally grown vegetables \u2013 for the capital.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2016/09/iraq_map/giv-31075V4678LRJOei3/\" data-alt=\"Falluja map\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2016/09/iraq_map/giv-31075V4678LRJOei3/\">Falluja map</a> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--supporting\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2016/09/falluja_map/giv-31075z6FcDPGYiSrp/\" data-alt=\"Iraq map\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2016/09/falluja_map/giv-31075z6FcDPGYiSrp/\">Iraq map</a> </figure>  <p>Even now, more than 25 years later, she can remember exactly what she loved about Falluja then, and about a life that was once \u201ceasy and beautiful\u201d and has now been lost.</p> <p>\u201cThe Euphrates in Falluja shimmers like silver when it is stirred by the wind and fills fishermen\u2019s nets with the most flavoursome fish in Iraq,\u201d she recalls. \u201cThe dense groves of Falluja with their narrow paths were full of pomegranates, apples and oranges.</p> <p>\u201cThere was no stranger in Falluja. People knew each other and were proud that there was no poor family in the city, thanks to almsgiving that most were happy to distribute among families of low income,\u201d Reema adds. \u201cGenerosity was the stamp of the city. The restaurants were different in Falluja to any other part of Iraq; generous with food and not charging much.</p> <p>\u201cThe locals believed that every newcomer was their guest.\u201d<br></p> <p>As 17-year-old Reema moved out of Falluja, she left behind a mother and father, two brothers, five sisters, three uncles, their wives and children, little thinking that many of them would be living together again, this time in much darker circumstances a decade later.</p> <h2>April-Nov 2004</h2> <p>After the US-led invasion in 2003, Baghdad was clearly the prize and Basra the challenge \u2013 but Falluja quickly emerged as the thorn in the side. </p> <p>When US troops killed protesters in Falluja in April 2003, resistance intensified in the city and it rapidly embodied the kind of defiance that American forces wanted to vanquish.</p> <p>In April 2004, a series of airstrikes sent at least half the city fleeing. Reema\u2019s family was no exception. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4b59dadb3f94e2e1d6d8291d23401fa0c07858e2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4b59dadb3f94e2e1d6d8291d23401fa0c07858e2/0_160_2400_1440/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A US tank pounds a building during a firefight in Falluja.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A US tank pounds a building during a firefight in Falluja.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>More than 20 adults and 10 children fled to her family home in Baghdad, where she lived with Ibrahim and their five (later six) children. It was a large house but still a squeeze for so many people. Beds and blankets came from a nearby mosque. After 25 days a truce was agreed in Falluja and the family went back.<br></p> <p>It was only a temporary respite. By November the Americans were back and this time it was brutal. Falluja was becoming a magnet for the resistance, with hundreds of armed fighters hiding among ordinary families. The US military faced its heaviest urban combat since Vietnam. More than 100 coalition troops died and more than 600 were injured. </p> <p>On this occasion, the Issawis disagreed over whether to leave or not. Many of the women and children left for Amiriyat Falluja about 12 miles to the south. Some uncles and cousins moved to Baghdad. As much as 90% of the population fled before the onslaught.</p> <p>But Reema\u2019s father, Ali Jassim, and brothers Ziyad and Muneer stayed on. The brothers ran a meat stall in one of Falluja\u2019s markets. They believed they could always dash for the suburbs if things got really bad.

Reema was pregnant with her sixth child when Shia militiamen wearing police uniforms stormed into her Baghdad home hunting her husband and brother.</p> <p>\u201cThere were lots of men armed with rifles, one of them was wearing a mask, I think he was nothing but an informant,\u201d she recalls. \u201cHe said, \u2018There should be three men in this house\u2019. I explained, \u2018My brother in law and his son are not at home, only my spouse\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>Reema was asked where her husband was from. Falluja, she replied. In that moment, his fate was sealed. It was dark except for the flickering lights of torches held by the armed men who ran up the stairs into the bedroom. They seized Ibrahim. Reema gave chase but a gunman turned to her and said: \u201cIf you keep following us, I will shoot you right now.\u201d</p> <p>That night, a dozen Sunni men were taken from the district. Some of their bodies were found the next day, dumped in a remote part of eastern Baghdad. Reema has not been able to find her husband\u2019s body to this day.<br></p> <p>This time it was not war that prompted her family to leave Falluja, but grief. Her family came to Baghdad to mourn Ibrahim\u2019s death with Reema. She would soon find herself homeless after her husband\u2019s family sold the house. Only the generosity of relatives and neighbours enabled Reema to pay for new lodgings with her six children. She has been eking out a modest living ever since, baking meat pies for her daughters\u2019 school for about \u00a350 a week, or doing odd jobs for neighbours.</p> <p>\u201cSome of the relatives and neighbours offered to pay the rent for the small house I found in the same neighbourhood for a month or two, then I had to find a job to earn my family living,\u201d Reema says.</p> <p>A year later, her family finally received compensation for the destruction wrought in 2004 and were able to rebuild their Falluja home. For several years, an uneasy hiatus persisted. Female family members came to see Reema again in 2007 when her brother-in-law was murdered and she was briefly homeless. Menfolk stayed behind as Baghdad was deadly for men during the sectarian war.</p> <p>The \u201csurge\u201d of US troops through 2007 put a lid on violence, but with the US military exit in 2010 and the transition of power to Iraqi authorities, a new insurgency began to bubble up in the so-called Sunni triangle.</p> <h2>2014</h2> <p> It was early in the morning when a car with three women and four children arrived at Reema\u2019s house in Baghdad. Isis had stormed through Iraq to take Mosul earlier in summer, and was advancing south-west towards Ramadi province and Falluja. Fear of more upheaval in the city was driving locals to flee.</p> <p>Reema\u2019s mother, Zahra, and two of her sisters were among the exodus, along with their five children. Her two brothers Ziyad and Muneer and their children stayed in Falluja.</p> <p>\u201cI felt sorry for my sister Reema, that she had to host 17 relatives in her tiny house at this time,\u201d says Samer, one of the sisters who had abandoned her home. \u201cBut I couldn\u2019t afford renting a house for my three kids. Not only that, being Falluja resident, it is not easy to rent a house in Baghdad.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe situation here is awful; you have to wait for hours to have a shower given the large number of the people who live in the house,\u201d she adds. \u201cBut what can we do? Our house in Falluja has been taken over by Isis.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e126e55bf75b9045ea6a109600389188d289e797\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e126e55bf75b9045ea6a109600389188d289e797/0_0_5152_3552/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Some internally displaced Iraqis have made the decision to return to Fallujah,\" width=\"1000\" height=\"689\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Some internally displaced Iraqis have made the decision to return to Fallujah,</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Khalid Mohammed/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Reema\u2019s mother kept in constant contact with her two sons in Falluja to make sure they were safe. As the war intensified, she desperately begged her sons to come to Baghdad. The two brothers were running a butcher\u2019s shop and sharing the family house with their nine children. They would flee to the suburbs of Baghdad whenever the aerial bombing became too much.</p> <p>\u201cIsis militants began to arrest men of Falluja who were in the security forces despite the fact that they have declared their repentance,\u201d says Hana Hassan, one of Reema\u2019s sisters-in-law, married to brother Muneer. \u201cSeveral people disappeared, then, their bodies were found at the edge of the city. As a woman, it became increasingly awkward to go for shopping in Falluja. Isis <em>hisba</em> (religious police) would be shouting in my face, \u2018Why aren\u2019t you wearing socks? Why aren\u2019t you wearing a veil?\u2019 though the weather was boiling and I always wear hijab.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"44357431fd91155eb2e03d0c634c27c4e81d177b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/44357431fd91155eb2e03d0c634c27c4e81d177b/0_0_2000_1200/1000.jpg\" alt=\"US marines train in an abandoned primary school outside Falluja in 2004 as they prepare for a major assault on the city.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">US marines train in an abandoned primary school outside Falluja in 2004 as they prepare for a major assault on the city.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Anja Niedringhaus/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Bombing raids escalated. They would start at 11pm and continue through the night, Iraqi warplanes dropped barrel bombs, followed by US missile attacks. \u201cMost of the victims were civilians as Isis militants and their families live in the most densely populated areas in Falluja,\u201d says Hana. \u201cLots of people left the city to escape the shooting. Only young men of Falluja admired Isis\u2019s doctrine of jihad. Tempted by money, they joined the fight for \u00a3275 a month.\u201d </p> <p>Reema\u2019s mother sent \u00a3300 for her two sons to pay for transport to Baghdad. They still needed permission to get through checkpoints, having been turned back by Isis on several occasions. \u201cIsis were warning families against going to the \u2018land of infidels\u2019, meaning Baghdad,\u201d says Hana.</p> <p>Reema\u2019s youngest brother got a medical report for his youngest son stating that he needed an eye operation in Baghdad. Soon, the two brothers packed their belongings and took the road leading to the Bazbaz bridge to cross the Euphrates river to Baghdad. At a checkpoint, an Isis official stopped their car and ordered them to step down.</p> <p>\u201cThe Isis militant handcuffed my husband and his brother,\u201d says Hana. \u201cThey suspected them of being collaborators with the Iraqi police. They said whenever you come to this checkpoint, the warplanes come to attack the site. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"de79f245d32331fcc286beda7a7232f09544c1f1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/de79f245d32331fcc286beda7a7232f09544c1f1/0_85_2464_1478/1000.jpg\" alt=\"An Iraqi man stands amid rubble of his destroyed house in Falluja\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">An Iraqi man stands amid rubble of his destroyed house in Falluja following fighting between US forces and insurgents in April 2004.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Karim Sahib/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cAll of a sudden US warplanes started to bomb the place and Isis militants dispersed. A lorry offered to take us all with him.

The officer checked our IDs and said women and children could cross the bridge, but he would keep the men to check a few details.\u201d</p> <p>And so it was that when her nine grandsons ran into Reema\u2019s house with Hana and Samer, the men were not among them. They will come soon after they finish with the police, Hana said to her mother-in-law.</p> <p>But they didn\u2019t. Reema and her mother began to worry. They contacted all the people they thought might know the whereabouts of the two brothers. They engaged a solicitor, whose early searches in detention centres in Baghdad proved fruitless.</p> <p>\u201cWe were distressed but we thought they were held by the police because they were from Falluja,\u201d says Reema.<br></p> <p>Eventually the solicitor called.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve found your two brothers, but I\u2019m sorry to tell you that your eldest brother had died under torture in the detention centre,\u201d he said.

She only regained her focus when she was taken to check the body.</p> <p>\u201cI was almost too afraid to get into the morgue,\u201d she says. \u201cI choked when my eyes fell on my brother\u2019s body, I passed my hand on his black hair and was struck by the big wound on the head blanketed by clotted blood, bruises were all over the body.

  "<h2>Above us only sky</h2> <p>You start off trying to change the world for the better. Along the way there are distractions, complications, and at some point there\u2019s a discussion about becoming living gods or whatever. Then, before you know it, you\u2019re planning to kill hundreds of people in an explosion. It\u2019s a story as old as time.</p> <p>And it\u2019s the story we were being told in the second season of Mr Robot, which wrapped up this week in an episode full of answers but short on satisfaction.</p> <p>The first answer was to the biggest question: what is Stage Two? Very similar to stage one, it turns out, though instead of hacking E Corp to destroy its information, the plan was to blow it up. This plan was concocted by Elliot Alderson (or at least the aspect of his personality known as Mr Robot) and Tyrell Wellick, a former executive of E Corp who was very much not killed by Elliot in the run-up to stage one.</p> <p>Elliot had believed that Tyrell was dead. I believed it too. But we were both just a couple of rubes because Tyrell was alive and in possession of a gun which fired a bullet into Elliot\u2019s gut. Elliot blacked out, which caused Mr Robot to fritz out too, but our hero isn\u2019t dead.</p> <p>We know this because the first thing Tyrell did was call Angela Moss, who seemed thoroughly unflustered by the news. This caused me some disquiet. It was obviously a shock to find the closest thing Elliot has to a love interest being involved in an apparent plot to wound him. But not only did I find this dramatic leap difficult to process, it also sent me scrambling backwards thinking: so there was a plan about what to do should Elliot resist stage two? And Angela was key to it? But she only met Whiterose in the last episode? And when did <em>she</em> learn that Tyrell wasn\u2019t dead?</p> <p>There\u2019s also the further complication that I had been coming to believe that E Corp were in on the hack, and that causing chaos was all part of Philip Price\u2019s greater game. If so, why try to rebuild the business through the accumulation of paper records?

And he did, to an extent. Not only do we know what Stage Two is, we know for sure Tyrell is alive, who was sending the messages to Joanna Wellick (that\u2019s bereaved E Corp CTO Scott Knowles), where Trenton and Mobley are hiding out (in California, at a fast food company) and who killed Romero (a neighbour, by accident).</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"84608db650f17ed90be4743c66eb3af996b1edff\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/84608db650f17ed90be4743c66eb3af996b1edff/0_0_1147_688/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Finally, we know how Leon got out of prison.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Finally, we know how Leon got out of prison.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Amazon</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Each answer turns out to be partial though, and in turn beg many more questions. I\u2019ve listed those about Angela, but there are also questions about where Tyrell has been, why Joanna cares so much about framing Knowles, what this magic Stage One control-z Trenton has managed to uncover is, and how Leon got out of prison and found them in the first place.</p> <p>Of Angela, Esmail tells Variety that:</p> <blockquote> <p>\u201cYou can just never quite read her. [Portia Doubleday] does it in such an exquisite fashion that we played up the notion where she\u2019s a character that\u2019s riding down the middle. On the one hand, you could feel that she\u2019s flipped and turned to E Corp, and on the other hand, no, she\u2019s trying to bring them down. We played with that the whole season. We thought that was so fascinating. We\u2019re double-downing. Our assumption by the end of the season was that she\u2019s siding with the Dark Army. As we move forward to the next season, it\u2019ll be interesting to play that dynamic. Is she really with them or is she not? It\u2019s just something with Angela\u2019s journey, we can always keep people off balance in terms of what directions she\u2019s actually going in.\u201d</p> </blockquote> <p>I don\u2019t think anyone could argue that Angela has not been as Esmail describes. The question is more how much the audience enjoys being thrown around in its perceptions like this. The uncertainty over E Corp I liked; if she was working with them it was to put some kind of mental block on her grief. If she was working against them, it was an effective ruse. But to now set up the same dilemma with another antagonist (only less motivation) I\u2019m inclined to find the whole thing a bit wilful.</p> <p>Whatever happens, I\u2019ll always have Dom DiPierro. The FBI agent interviewed Darlene this week and tried to bring her onside in the ongoing investigation against f.soc and the Dark Army, \u201cone of the biggest events in world history\u201d. Darlene is, to put it mildly, disinclined to engage. \u201cGo suck a dick\u201d is how she puts it. But a late introduction to Dom\u2019s spider diagram of crime suggests that maybe the lady <em>is</em> for turning. Stay tuned for a bad-ass double act in season three.</p> <h2>The remaining questions</h2> <p>What is WhiteRose\u2019s endgame? What is going on at the Washington Plant? What happened to Angela and Elliot\u2019s parents? Can Trenton make the world whole again?Will Mr Robot wake up when Elliot does?</p> <h2>Note to the reader</h2> <p>It\u2019s been great to do these recaps with you this season.

  "<p>Canada regularly detains hundreds of children who have run afoul of the country\u2019s immigration laws \u2013 including some who are held in correctional facilities and even in solitary confinement, according to a new report calling for sweeping reforms to the practice.<br></p> <p>Between 2010 and 2014, an average of 242 children were detained across Canada over immigration violations, according to the International Human Rights Program at the University of Toronto. Their report, released on Thursday, sheds light on these detentions, which range in length from days to several months, and calls for urgent reform to a Canadian practice that has attracted consistent criticism from the United Nations. </p> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s happening with children in detention really runs counter to the narrative of Canada as a global human rights promoter,\u201d said Samer Muscati, the report\u2019s editor. \u201cCanada has signed international agreements, including the Convention on the Rights of the Child, which clearly states that any detention has to be done as a last resort and for the least amount of time possible.\u201d</p> <p>The practice of regularly detaining children is among the many issues that plague Canada\u2019s immigration detention system. Across the country, the Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) has the power to detain non-citizens deemed to be a flight risk, who pose a threat to public safety or whose identities cannot be confirmed. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/17/canada-immigration-detention-deaths-border-services-agency\">Immigrant deaths expose 'legal black hole' of Canada's detention system</a> </p> </aside>  <p>A lack of transparency and oversight mars the system, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/17/canada-immigration-detention-deaths-border-services-agency\">resulting in what critics have described as a \u201clegal black hole\u201d.</a> Since 2000, at least 15 people have died in the custody of the CBSA, including five who are thought to have died from natural causes and three by suicide. Six deaths remain attributed to unknown causes. </p> <p>Thursday\u2019s report focuses on the children \u2013 ranging from newborns to teenagers \u2013 ensnared in the same system. Some are formally detained. Others are Canadian citizens who are forced to choose between separating from parents who have been detained by immigration authorities or living in detention with their parents as de facto detainees. Those who stay with their parents still face family separation, in that they are held with their mother and have limited visits during the day with their father. </p> <p>The figures in the report probably underestimate the scale of the issue, said Muscati, as the data mostly reflects children who are formally detained. \u201cWe still don\u2019t have an accurate number or idea of how many children are informally detained.\u201d</p> <p>Those detained hail from around the world with children from sub-Saharan Africa making up the largest group, at 23% of the children detained. The average length of detention is 10 days for children who are formally detained. For those who are held informally with their parents, the average length of the detention stretches to nearly 30 days. \u201cBecause under the law they\u2019re invisible, their interests aren\u2019t identified and represented,\u201d said Muscati. \u201cSo they actually languish in these facilities for longer periods of time than formally detained children.\u201d </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bb82298697c714a08d2c9ef6e287a29557a7dfc4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bb82298697c714a08d2c9ef6e287a29557a7dfc4/0_98_2843_1705/1000.jpg\" alt=\"the Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA)\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Across the country, the Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) has the power to detain non-citizens deemed to be a flight risk.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Most children are held in medium-security immigration holding centres. But a small number have wound up in correctional facilities or police stations across the country. </p> <p>The report also flagged what Muscati called \u201ca whole other, really horrible scenario\u201d, referring to findings on the use of solitary confinement for two, unaccompanied 16-year-old boys. One of them \u2013 a Syrian boy who had attempted to claim refugee status after entering Canada from the US \u2013 was left in isolation for three weeks. Loath to put the young males in the women\u2019s section and worried that they may be at risk in the men\u2019s section, authorities chose to place them in solitary confinement. </p> <p>Even just a few days in detention can cause serious and long-lasting psychological harm to children. Studies have shown children who are detained experience increased symptoms of post-traumatic stress, anxiety and depression, and are more likely to contemplate suicide. These symptoms often persist long after the children are released. </p> <p>As less than 2% of those detained are considered a threat to public safety, the report highlights alternatives, such as those used in Sweden and Hong Kong, which allow children to reside with their families in the community through the use of reporting obligations, financial deposits and guarantees, or electronic monitoring. </p> <p>Responding to the report, the CBSA said it was aware of the issue and said \u201ctangible steps\u201d are in the works to address the situation. The agency said it has been working to \u201creset the immigration detention program\u201d to increase the use of alternatives and eliminate the detention of minors, except in the most limited and exceptional circumstances.</p> <p>The agency falls under the portfolio of Canada\u2019s public safety ministry. In a statement to the Guardian, the office of Ralph Goodale, Canada\u2019s public safety minister, noted that the minister has been clear about wanting to try to avoid housing children in detention facilities, \u201cas much as humanly possible.\u201d</p> <p>The agency plans to expand alternatives to detention and will begin publishing statistics on immigration detention in the near future. \u201cAs well, additional mental health training for staff at Immigration Holding Centres has already begun.\u201d <br></p> <p>Their efforts were noted by those behind the report, who said that recent months have seen a decline in the number of children taken into custody. </p> <p>\u201cAfter years of silence and inaction, the Canadian government and CBSA are taking serious steps that will hopefully bring us closer to ending child detention and family separation,\u201d said Hanna Gros, one of the report\u2019s co-authors. \u201cBut Ottawa needs to move quickly and deliberately to end the needless suffering of children and their parents.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Six days after Terence Crutcher was fatally shot by a Tulsa police officer, and despite the release of video and audio, key details remain disputed. Did the 40-year-old have his hands up at the moment Betty Shelby opened fire? Was he reaching towards the inside of his SUV, and was the window open or shut? Were police influenced by his race? Was he behaving erratically, as if on drugs \u2013 and even if that was the case, could it provide any sort of justification for killing him?</p> <p>What cannot be challenged, based on clear video evidence from a squad car\u2019s dashcam of the encounter last Friday evening, is that after Crutcher had been shot once in the chest, tased by another officer and sank to the ground, lying still and bleeding profusely, the officers near him did not immediately provide medical assistance. In fact, they backed away tentatively in tandem, weapons still drawn, as more colleagues arrived.</p> <p>It is not until almost two minutes later that an officer approaches Crutcher \u2013 to examine his clothes, evidently to check if he is armed. Finally, about 30 seconds later, an effort is made to administer first aid.</p> <p>In addition to anger at the death of an unarmed man whose interaction with police began merely because his car appeared to have broken down in the middle of the road, some activists are outraged at what they argue was a lack of urgency as Crutcher lay on the ground. </p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/sep/20/tulsa-shooting-helicopter-footage-shows-victim-unarmed-and-walking-away-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/53zbm\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2734069\"            data-video-name=\"Tulsa shooting: helicopter footage shows victim unarmed and walking away \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"AP\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-57e0dbe5e4b02fcdee725df4\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/09/20/160920TulsaShooting1_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/09/20/160920TulsaShooting1.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/09/20/160920TulsaShooting1_WebM.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/sep/20/tulsa-shooting-helicopter-footage-shows-victim-unarmed-and-walking-away-video\">Tulsa shooting: helicopter footage shows victim unarmed and walking away</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>They accused police of callous indifference towards his fate. \u201cThey just sat there and let him bleed out. That is disregard for humanity, in itself,\u201d said Marq Lewis, a local community organiser.</p> <p>Ryan Kiesel, executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Oklahoma, said the police\u2019s actions were \u201creprehensible and indefensible\u201d and compounded the tragedy. \u201cThey dehumanised him even further in death by allowing him to bleed out, failing to render any sort of immediate aid and even casually milling about the scene. There is on the video no sense of urgency among any of the police officers about trying to save this man\u2019s life,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Shelby has basic training as an emergency medical responder, but her attorney said that her colleagues told her not to help the man she had just shot. \u201cI know Officer Shelby, after she was taken to the back of her car, you can see that on the video, said \u2018please let me get my EMT bag and let me go work on this man\u2019. The officers there thought it best that in her state of mind that she not go back up there, but I do know Officer Shelby wanted to,\u201d Scott Wood said.</p> <p>Amid the ongoing nationwide focus on fatal encounters between police and African American people, departments around the country have drawn criticism for not rendering aid promptly in high-profile incidents captured on video.</p> <p>Last year, following the failure of officers in Cleveland to help Tamir Rice, a 12-year-old boy they fatally shot in 2014, the city <a href=\"http://www.cleveland.com/metro/index.ssf/2015/05/clevelands_settlement_with_the.html\">agreed to changes</a> in its use of force policy that include a requirement to provide emergency first aid.</p> <p>It was several minutes after he was shot inside a car in July before police in Minnesota began administering first aid to Philando Castile. He died in hospital about 20 minutes after sustaining multiple gunshot wounds.</p> <p>As with many aspects of police training, medical standards and expectations vary widely across the country. Boston, for example, has a <a href=\"http://static1.squarespace.com/static/5086f19ce4b0ad16ff15598d/t/52af5ed8e4b0dbce9d22a784/1387224792153/Rule+203.pdf\">detailed policy</a> requiring officers to give first aid while waiting for an ambulance.</p> <p>When Houston police fatally shot Alva Braziel in a street last July, body camera footage shows officers were more focused on ensuring the scene was safe and talking with witnesses than on attempting life-saving measures.</p> <p>An officer leans over Braziel\u2019s body and pries what appears to be a gun from his right hand, as another stands nearby, weapon drawn \u2013 but <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mZQgdlWjwk\">the footage</a> does not indicate that anyone tried to administer first aid. An officer is heard saying an ambulance has been called; it arrives about six minutes after the shooting.</p> <p>A Houston police spokesman declined to discuss the incident because it is still under internal investigation. Generally, he said: \u201cWe do not have medical training at HPD, we leave that up to the fire department and the paramedics \u2026 Some officers are trained and have use of tourniquets but not all 5,200.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBest practice is that after the shooting occurs and as soon as the officers are assured that they are safe, and that the scene is stable, the officers need to shift from being in enforcement mode to being life-savers and trying to provide what may be life-saving medical assistance,\u201d said Jim Bueermann, a former police chief in California who is president of the Police Foundation, a national police thinktank based in Washington. \u201cBut it\u2019s this matter of making sure the scene is stable. Using Tulsa as the example, they had to first make sure that there was no one else in the vehicle.</p> <p>\u201cSomeone who is wounded by the police can still be capable of shooting them. There are examples where police have shot and wounded a guy and he was able to shoot them. A gun concealed in a waistband; or there are examples of someone being arrested and put in a police car and they missed that he had a gun in his pocket and then he shoots them,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cBut there is a huge problem \u2013 this is a huge issue, it\u2019s the number one issue, this issue of the police use of force and shooting people of colour and how it affects community trust and confidence in the police. On a national level, this is THE issue.\u201d</p> <p>The Tulsa officers cannot be accused of failing to follow the department\u2019s medical protocols \u2013 because there aren\u2019t any. \u201cWe do not currently have a policy regarding rendering medical aid,\u201d said Jeanne MacKenzie, a spokeswoman.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/21/terence-crutcher-wasnt-bad-dude-just-black-man-in-america\">Terence Crutcher wasn't a 'bad dude' \u2013\u00a0just a black man in America | Michael Twitty</a> </p> </aside>  <p>She said Oklahoma state standards require eight hours of CPR and basic first aid training, which the Tulsa force supplements with another eight hours of \u201ctactical medical training\u201d, which focuses on \u201cproviding a student with training more specific to battlefield trauma. So we focus more on stopping heavy bleeds, clearing blocked airways and treating penetrating chest injuries.\u201d</p> <p>A decision by the local district attorney on whether Shelby will face criminal charges is not expected before next week.</p> <p>Peaceful protests and vigils have been held each day since police made the footage public on Monday.

Despite how often moviegoers have seen Batman\u2019s parents gunned down in an alley, no shortage of films and TV shows choose to dramatise it yet again. But long before capes and masks were dominating cinemas, the film industry was giving audiences another kind of myth: the presidential origin story, of which Barack Obama films <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/jan/25/southside-with-you-review-obamas-first-date-is-before-sunset-sans-subtlety\">Southside With You</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/sep/15/barry-review-this-years-second-young-obama-movie-boasts-hope-and-audacity\">Barry</a> are the latest entries in the genre.</p> <p>Americans love a good presidential biopic, even ones for those commanders-in-chief who might not immediately jump to mind as worthy of the treatment.

John Ford\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJKWguqabUU\">Young Mr Lincoln</a> \u2013 like Wilson, released by Fox, though five years earlier \u2013 is a lightly factual origin story about Abraham Lincoln. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PT_109_(film)\">PT 109</a> \u2013 which hit cinemas five months before the assassination of its real-life inspiration, John F Kennedy \u2013 took inspiration from <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motor_Torpedo_Boat_PT-109\">JFK\u2019s command of a navy boat</a> during the second world war. In both cases, these films seek to build a throughline from the lessons learned in an early conflict to the rise to power. JFK discovers how to lead men through crisis.

Barry, directed by <a href=\"http://www.hbo.com/vice\">Vice on HBO</a> host and documentarian <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vikram_Gandhi\">Vikram Gandhi</a>, depicts Barack\u2019s struggles to adapt to living in New York City in the early 1980s.</p> <p>Southside director Richard Tanne attempted to make a film that was both about Barack and Michelle Obama, but also a film that could stand on its own as a romance. \u201cMy job was just to build a credible love story, but the dramatic irony of the film is we all know what they went on to accomplish, the history that they made, however not everybody feels the same way about them,\u201d he explains over the phone.</p> <p>Southside covers only a single day in the life of these two people, rather than the biographical sprawl of Oliver Stone\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/jun/03/nixon-oliver-stone-reel-history\">Nixon</a> or <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2008/nov/12/reel-history-george-bush-w-biopic-josh-brolin\">W</a>, works that are significantly more critical of their subjects than the average film about a president. The film begins before the date, as Michelle Robinson and Barack Obama \u2013 colleagues at a law firm in Chicago \u2013 get ready, chat with their parents and express trepidation over the upcoming rendezvous. Is it a date? Michelle is convinced it isn\u2019t. Barack\u2019s mother asks if the new girl is white. She isn\u2019t. Tanne plays up the initial friction, casting some doubt on the relationship, even if the outcome is predetermined.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"14dcbbbd62ce9b38264831757307ec04b19b97ec\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/14dcbbbd62ce9b38264831757307ec04b19b97ec/0_185_1724_1034/1000.jpg\" alt=\"President as war hero ...

She skipped second and third grade and was already a second-year associate at the biggest firm in Chicago after graduating Harvard Law.\u201d Michelle\u2019s prodigious talent, her success to that point in her career, and her keen understanding of the unsavoury aspects of office politics make her initial scepticism over dating a subordinate understandable. \u201cShe was well ahead of where Barack was professionally at that time,\u201d Tanne says.</p> <p>Michelle is played by Tika Sumpter, who has popped up in a variety of high-profile projects \u2013 from a Madea movie and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/jan/13/ride-along-2-review-ice-cube-kevin-hart\">Ride Along 2</a> to the James Brown biopic <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/aug/01/get-on-up-review-james-brown-biopic\">Get On Up</a>. She was the first actor cast and is also a producer on Southside. The search for Barack was far more complicated. \u201cWe read about 30 Los Angeles-based actors and we got tapes sent in from elsewhere around the country,\u201d Tanne says. \u201cEveryone we read was a terrific actor, but they weren\u2019t quite Obama. They couldn\u2019t get the president out of their minds. I just needed them to be a guy trying to get a girl.\u201d</p> <p>The role eventually went to newcomer Parker Sawyers, who does a remarkable job capturing the essence of one of the most famous men in the world. \u201cI did the audition, but it was a straight-on impersonation. It was not nuanced, it wasn\u2019t even very good acting,\u201d says Sawyers. \u201cI didn\u2019t hear anything back, and then it came back around in April 2015. I spoke to Rich for 20 minutes. He says: \u2018Dude, drop the impersonation. Just play yourself. Just be you. No Barack.\u2019\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"483950f86af83ea05557edd6a1b0a72697663c6a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/483950f86af83ea05557edd6a1b0a72697663c6a/0_0_1787_1072/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Oliver Stone\u2019s Nixon, starring Anthony Hopkins, left, is considerably more critical of its subject than most presidential biopics.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Oliver Stone\u2019s Nixon, starring Anthony Hopkins (left) is considerably more critical of its subject than most presidential biopics.

They are fundamentally not the same person that they are today \u2013 less aware of people watching them, unaffected by the spotlight and significantly less performative. Sawyers and Sumpter don\u2019t really tip their hats to the Obamas\u2019 future role in American history until key moments in the film\u2019s final act, but even then, it\u2019s all quite subtle and never distracts from Tanne\u2019s \u201ccredible love story\u201d.</p> <p>The most curious aspect of both Barry (which is to be released globally by Netflix) and Southside is that they are both coming out while Obama is still in office, which gives them another thing in common with PT 109. I tell Tanne that I was initially put off by the idea of a film about the Obamas coming so soon after they ascended to the White House. The history is too recent, I say. Of course, it\u2019s not that recent, as the first date was over 20 years ago. Stripped of any political or historical significance, the film is simply a clever way to tell one of the most common stories there is: the initial spark of love between two interesting people.</p> <p>\u201cBack in 2007, I was really taken by them as a couple, the way they looked at each other, the way they flirted,\u201d Tanne says. \u201cIt\u2019s a very authentic, sexy, and vibrant connection between them. I find that to be rare in people that you meet, everyday folks, and even rarer in public figures.\u201d How difficult it would be to pull off this movie about most other recent presidents. The Obamas are unique in that their affection pops off the screen whenever they share a stage.</p> <p>I ask Tanne how Obama\u2019s final presidential legacy might affect the way his movie is perceived in the future. Will it be a Young Mr Lincoln-esque work that spawns an enduring myth? Or will it be viewed with a sceptical eye, the way something like Wilson is consumed, as the public begins to sour on the Obama era? He pauses. Real history, he thinks, \u201cshades the movie. As the legacy evolves, I can imagine that audiences will see the film differently, as the pendulum swings one way and then the other way, there\u2019s going to be constantly changing perceptions of the movie as relates to his legacy.\u201d What can never be undone is the barrier Barack and Michelle broke, and the impact that will have on the US, for decades to come.</p> <p>\u2022 <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=erpUF2ToUls\">Southside With You</a> is released in the UK on 30 September</p>",

Because all you can rely on is what you walk on to that stage with.</p> <p>I have moderated two presidential debates (in 1988 and 1992), but back then there were three questioners and one moderator keeping time. This new style with one moderator puts an incredible amount of pressure on him or her to do both the breadth and the depth needed for a general election debate.

I would not only go back and look at exactly what each candidate said on the important issues but also where they later changed their tune even slightly \u2013 because you can\u2019t allow a candidate to wiggle out of discrepancies and flip flops.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/21/green-party-jill-stein-presidential-debates-hofstra-new-york\">Green party may try to \u2018escort\u2019 Jill Stein into the presidential debates</a> </p> </aside>  <p>A good question allows the candidate to reveal more about an issue or a leadership characteristic than the audience previously knew. Just repeating campaign platform positions on issues is a debate that has not served its purpose. It\u2019s all about illuminating information that the American voter didn\u2019t know before the debate started. Ninety percent of the debate no one will remember, but people will remember how the candidate handled the tough questions. </p> <p>Every moderator will hit a moment when he knows the question is not being answered, or that the factual answer being given is wrong. And in every single case, the moderator has to decide \u2013 how hard to I push? Do I move on? Or do I allow the other candidate an opening to correct the factual record? In a perfect world, if I were asking Hillary Clinton a question, I would give Trump an opportunity to call her out. But sometimes the timing doesn\u2019t work that way, and you can\u2019t stay on a question forever. Two follow-ups is about as far as you can go. Every moderator knows there is a danger that you will look up and find that you\u2019ve done 15 minutes on something you wanted to do only five on. After two, you have to leave it there. The audience understands. This person is not answering the question.</p> <p>The most advice for the moderator: don\u2019t over eat and use the bathroom before you get out there. You\u2019ve got 90 minutes without a break. Ninety minutes of sitting there. That\u2019s a long time \u2013 and you\u2019ve got to be at your sharpest. </p> <p>\u2013<em> <a href=\"http://iop.harvard.edu/fellows/ann-compton\">Ann Compton</a> is a veteran White House correspondent for ABC News (1973-2014) and current fellow at Harvard Institute of Policitcs.</em></p> <h2>\u2018People go to a baseball game to watch the game, not the umpire\u2019</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"62fe9d9dd44deed0447192211d988194c5f5ef9f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/62fe9d9dd44deed0447192211d988194c5f5ef9f/921_13_1397_1398/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Bob Schieffer.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bob Schieffer.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jason Reed/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>If I was walking into a debate with Trump and Clinton, I\u2019d make sure to have a lot of questions.

When I did my first debate in 2004, I had this dream that I got to my last question and looked at the clock and there was still 20 minutes left. I was terrified. I woke up in a cold sweat!

I had 300 questions ready!</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The important thing for the moderator to remember is that people go to a baseball game to watch the game, not the umpire. We\u2019re not electing the moderator. We\u2019re electing the president of the United States. You want each person to answer the question, yes, but you have to let the other candidate be the first fact-checker first. If the audience hears a lie, they first want to see if the opponent has picked up on it. If he doesn\u2019t, then I think you can step in. But people wanna hear from the other guy more than they want to hear from you. If the moderator understands there\u2019s been an egregious statement of fact or totally contradicted what they\u2019ve said earlier, he or she should say so. You don\u2019t say: \u201cYou\u2019re absolutely wrong.\u201d You bring up the evidence, and say something like: \u201cYou said the opposite three weeks ago.\u201d It\u2019s your obligation to point that out. But it\u2019s hard. You\u2019re doing this in real-time.</p> <p>What you try to do as a moderator is act as a guiding hand. You give each person a chance to show their best \u2013 and if their worst shows up well, that\u2019s part of the story too. And when it comes to making sure they answer a question, or don\u2019t give the stock responses they\u2019ve been so well trained to do, I\u2019ve always tried to be as specific as I can with my questioning. For example \u201cLast week, you said X\u201d or \u201cWhat do you mean by that?\u201d or \u201cHow would that play out?\u201d so that they can\u2019t fall back into the pablum kind of answers that we get so often from politicians .

You have 10,000 people in a confined space and tensions are getting worse, and the children are more vulnerable.\u201d<br></p> <p>A census carried out by the charity<a href=\"http://www.helprefugees.org.uk/\"> Help Refugees </a>estimated this week that the camp population has increased to around 10,188, a 12% increase on last month, with 1,179 minors, of whom 87% are traveling alone; the youngest unaccompanied child is eight years old. </p> <p>Almost a third of the children are from Afghanistan, a quarter from Sudan and a quarter from Eritrea. Police clashed with camp residents on Wednesday, using teargas grenades, and violent incidents are increasing.<br></p> <p>The current emergency provision of just 45 beds for refugee children in Saint Omer was completely inadequate, Roger said. Two further emergency centres, one with 70 beds and one with 75 places, will be opened in November and early 2017, but these are also likely to be insufficient to house the rising numbers, he said. Children eventually move into foster care or more permanent housing, but they often need to stay in the emergency shelter for weeks, while their application to remain is processed.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/19/theresa-may-refugees-welfare-migrant\">Theresa May isn\u2019t interested in refugees\u2019 welfare.

  "<p>What most of us remember from our early childhoods are fleeting images that leave faint trails, later to be recaptured by smells or sounds. For Andrew Solomon, there was one extremely vivid early memory, and it formed him. He was in a car, aged about seven, when his Jewish father told him about the Holocaust. The small boy gradually made sense of it, then two thoughts came to him: he decided that he would never allow himself to be \u201chelpless, dependent or credulous\u201d; and that, since the Jews had not escaped their persecutors in time, he would seek safety in leaving \u201cbefore the borders were closed\u201d. Since some Jews had been saved by non-Jewish friends, he would also make it his business to have \u201cbroad affections\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/sep/16/against-the-wall-mexico-calais-division\">Against the wall: from Mexico to Calais, why the idea of division is taking hold</a> </p> </aside>  <p>So begins the introduction to <em>Far &amp; Away</em>, a collection of Solomon\u2019s articles, written during almost 30 years of wandering \u2013 he has visited 83 of the world\u2019s 196 countries \u2013 looking, listening, trying to understand. Not for nothing did he subtitle <em>The Reckoning</em>, his book on the shooting at Sandy Hook elementary school, \u201csearching for meaning\u201d. That is what Solomon does: he looks for meaning.</p> <p>The idea of a foreign refuge was attractive to the anxious boy, fearful, as he endearingly explains, of everything from scuffles in the school playground to a nuclear attack, and he was fortunate in having a mother who not only loved to travel but insisted on going well prepared. It developed in him a keen curiosity and a profound interest in the nature of travel itself, in \u201cdifference\u201d, and in dealing with strangers. As a reporter, he taught himself to move slowly, take time to get to know the people he met and to look at their worlds without haste or prejudice. \u201cTravel,\u201d he writes, \u201cmakes you modest.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Solomon is an engaging guide \u2013 keen-eyed, self-reflective, shrewd, humane \u2013 and these articles have a pleasing passion</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Many of these 30 collected pieces \u2013 for which he provides explanatory notes and updates \u2013 reflect the central concerns of his life: art, mental health, gay rights and countries in momentous times (many appeared first in the New Yorker). Solomon calls himself a \u201cgeneralist, a collector of experiences, and an eccentric one at that\u201d.</p> <p>The article that opens the collection was written for Harpers &amp; Queen in 1988, and is the story of a visit to Moscow to attend the first auction by Sotheby\u2019s of contemporary Russian art, when increasing liberalisation suddenly made popular a number of long-ostracised avant garde artists, bringing them fame and untold money. \u201cThe Winter Palettes\u201d is one of a number of pieces on Soviet art, and later grew into the first of his bestselling, award-winning books, <em>The Irony Tower</em>. Other pieces explore similar territory: South Africa\u2019s art world before the end of apartheid; art in China in the 1990s; and Taiwan\u2019s neglected painters.</p> <p>Fascination with countries at moments of transition, whether crumbling or acquiring new direction, has taken Solomon to Libya, in the closing years of Gaddafi\u2019s reign; to Afghanistan, soon after the fall of the Taliban; to Myanmar, faltering towards democracy; and to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/riodejaneiro\">Rio de Janeiro</a>, when the city was trying to confront organised crime before the 2014 World Cup. He is an engaging guide \u2013 keen-eyed, self-reflective, shrewd, humane \u2013 and these articles have a pleasing passion. Other pieces are lighter \u2013 describing scuba diving off the Barrier Reef, and learning to paint on the coast of Turkey. Solomon is an assiduous collector of facts and an often humorous stylist. In Mongolia, listening to camels at night, he notes that they howl like \u201cthe spirits of purgatory crying out\u201d and that when thirsty their humps \u201cdroop like ageing bosoms\u201d.</p> <p>There is also an enjoyable account \u2013 which featured in his excellent book on depression, <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/noonday-demon.html\"><em>The Noonday Demon</em></a> \u2013 of a visit to a shamanistic healer in Senegal, where he was put into bed with a dead ram, covered, while naked, with its blood, tied to a tree with its intestines and spat at by women, before dancing and eating the barbecued ram. It left him \u201cup! I felt up!\u201d, he writes, and prompted him, as a long-term depressive, to consider the nature of depression as an illness.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/apr/22/literature-about-medicine-may-be-all-that-can-save-us\">\u2018Literature about medicine may be all that can save us\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The last article, written in 2015, touches once again on himself as a small boy, this time being reproved by his mother for not being adventurous enough and resolving to become so through sheer will. These loosely autobiographical travel pieces, \u201cpsychological studies rather than political ones\u201d, are eloquent proof of how successful he has been at becoming bold. Over the years, Solomon has also come to believe that travel itself may be as important as school attendance and environmental awareness in forming good citizens. Travel, he writes, \u201cis a set of corrective lenses that helps focus the planet\u2019s blurred reality\u201d. Without going to places there is no real understanding of \u201cotherness\u201d, and otherness in all its forms, social, political, mental and sexual is what Solomon has spent his life exploring.</p> <p>\u2022 To order <em>Far &amp; Away: Reporting from the Brink of Change: Seven Continents, Twenty-Five Years </em>for \u00a320.50 (Scribner RRP \u00a325) go to <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/far-and-away-422137.html?utm_source=editoriallink&amp;utm_medium=merch&amp;utm_campaign=article\">bookshop.theguardian.com</a> or call 0330 333 6846.

  "<p>Richard Sherman, the Seattle Seahawks cornerback, says \u201cpeople are missing the point\u201d of Colin Kaepernick\u2019s national anthem protest, as NFL players continue to wrestle with the debate that has made headlines around the league over the past few weeks.</p> <p>Sherman, who declined to take questions at a news conference on Wednesday, said the protest\u2019s aim was to bring people together to forge a better America, and that critics were mistaken if they thought Kaepernick and others were being unpatriotic. \u201cThe reason these guys are kneeling, the reason we\u2019re locking arms, is to bring people together to make people aware that this is not right. It\u2019s not right for people to get killed in the street,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cWhen a guy takes a knee, you can ignore it, you can say he\u2019s not being patriotic, he\u2019s not honoring the flag. I\u2019m doing none of those things. I\u2019m saying it straight up: this is wrong, and we need to do something.\u201d</p> <p>More NFL players spoke about the protests on Wednesday. Miami Dolphins safety Michael Thomas and linebacker Jelani Jenkins said they had received death threats on social media following their protest, but that they were committed to push for better race relations.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s great a lot of people in our community, including our law enforcement, have the mindset of yes, there is something wrong,\u201d Thomas said. \u201cSomething needs to change, and we\u2019re just looking for solutions and working together to find them.\u201d</p> <p>Thomas, Jenkins, Arian Foster and Kenny Stills knelt together during the anthem at the Dolphins\u2019 opener. Reaction to the gesture by the four black players was mixed and sometimes ugly.</p> <p>\u201cRacism is alive and well \u2026 \u2018You should go back to Africa,\u2019 or the N-word,\u201d Thomas said. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t matter. I know what I\u2019m standing for is right.\u201d</p> <p>Kaepernick, the San Francisco 49ers quarterback, began the anthem protest that other NFL players have since joined.

We want to reach out and get into the community with police officers and youth and do everything we can to create a great environment in our community.\u201d</p> <p>Thomas said: \u201cIt\u2019s time to find solutions. People aren\u2019t crying wolf \u2013 this is our reality. People feel their lives are worth less than those who aren\u2019t of color.\u201d<br></p> <p>Sherman, who grew up in Compton and went to college at Stanford, ended his press availablity on Wednesday without taking any questions, but read a lengthy statement instead.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to answer any questions today and it\u2019s no offense to you guys, but I think the state of the things in the world today is very interesting.</p> <p>\u201cYou have players that are trying to take a stand and trying to be aware of social issues and trying to make a stand and put a spotlight on it, and they\u2019re being ignored. Whether they\u2019re taking a knee or whether they\u2019re locking arms, they\u2019re trying to bring people together and unite them for a cause, and I think that the last couple of days a couple of more guys have gotten shot and killed in the middle of the street, and more videos have come out of guys getting killed.</p> <p>\u201cWhen you tell a kid, \u2018When you\u2019re dealing with police, just put your hands up and comply with everything,\u2019 and there\u2019s still a chance of them getting shot and no repercussions for anyone, that\u2019s an unfortunate time to be living,\u201d Sherman said. \u201cIt\u2019s an unfortunate place to be in.

More than a dozen police officers were injured during the protest. There also was vandalism.</p> <p>Newton said that while he doesn\u2019t see things through a \u201cblack-white lens,\u201d he does realize that people view him as a spokesman for black people because of his stature in the NFL.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m an African American and I\u2019m not happy how the justice has been dealt with over the years, and the state of oppression in our community, but we also as black people have to do right by ourselves,\u201d Newton said. \u201cWe can\u2019t be hypocrites.\u201d</p> <p>Newton went on to say: \u201cFrom being a black person, there is a lot of black people that don\u2019t do right by black people, so you can\u2019t be a hypocrite and just say \u2018Oh a white man or a white police officer killed a black man.\u2019 Now that\u2019s still messed up and I\u2019m not sitting up here and saying that\u2019s OK.</p> <p>\u201cI am saying we have to have a clear eye vision on both sides and starts with everyone holding each other accountable and policing yourselves.\u201d</p> <p>Newton is unsure if his teammates plan to join Kaepernick in a silent protest before Carolina\u2019s home Sunday against Minnesota. He did praise Kaepernick\u2019s stance, which includes calling for responsible parties to be held accountable.</p> <p>\u201cI salute Colin Kaepernick for what he stands for, but at the end of day I can make a stand in my own right,\u201d Newton said. \u201cThat is why I have a foundation and I have been trying to do anything and everything to bring the city of Charlotte, or wherever I am around, and impact it in a positive way.

  "<p>The commissioner of the Metropolitan police has said that the force should have been more sensitive about the introduction of spit hoods, after plans to use them in London were met with an outcry. </p> <p>However, Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe told the London assembly\u2019s police and crime committee that he did not think that the use of the hoods, already in place across 18 British police forces and approved by the National Police Chiefs\u2019 Council, was particularly contentious. </p> <p>Sadiq Khan, the mayor of London, earlier this month <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/sep/06/met-police-pause-plan-to-introduce-spit-hoods\">ordered a pause in the plan to introduce the use of spit hoods</a> in the capital\u2019s custody suites, which had been approved by the Met without his knowledge.<br></p> <p>Responding to questions as to whether there ought to have been more engagement with the public, Hogan-Howe said: \u201cProbably we should have been more sensitive to what you\u2019ve described and we take that on the chin and accept it. </p> <p>\u201cThe dilemma that we have is we have significant number of officers bitten or spit at each year. I think over the last three years we\u2019ve had 264 officers spit at, I think another one last night who was spit at as they arrested someone for a firearms offence, and then we\u2019ve had \u2026 498 incidents over the past five years of biting.\u201d</p> <p>Hogan-Howe said the decision to introduce the mesh hoods, which cover the whole of a suspect\u2019s head, making it impossible for them to spit at or bite officers, was not taken lightly and was discussed five times at the Met\u2019s policy forum. </p> <p>\u201cWe thought in the end that it wasn\u2019t too intrusive a tactic and the way of mitigating any concerns that people may have was to make sure it was in a very controlled environment,\u201d he said, referring to the decision to restrict their use to custody suites. </p> <p>He added: \u201cPerhaps we didn\u2019t anticipate the emotional response and the proper interest that people have.\u201d </p> <p>The use of spit hoods by British police was highlighted in July, after witnesses filmed four British Transport Police officers <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/jul/28/man-complains-after-police-place-spit-hood-over-head-during-arrest-london-bridge\">pinning a 20-year-old man to the ground at London Bridge station and pulling a hood over his head</a>. He was later released after accepting a caution for an offence under section five of the Public Order Act. The incident is being investigated by the Independent Police Complaints Commission.</p> <p>Freedom of information requests by the Guardian later revealed that <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2016/aug/29/uk-police-forces-under-pressure-to-stop-using-spit-hoods\">the practice had been used more than 500 times since last year</a>, and on children as young as 13, mostly by a handful of provincial police forces.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Scotland Yard\u2019s plan to begin using the tactic at 32 police station custody suites was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/sep/06/met-police-to-start-using-spit-hoods-on-suspects-within-weeks\">revealed only after questions to the force</a>, prompting Khan, who was unaware of the plan, to ask them to postpone the pilot.<br></p> <p>Hogan-Howe said teething problems surrounding the handover from the previous mayoral administration had left Khan and his team unaware of the plan. \u201cThis was our decision prior to the mayor and deputy mayor arriving,\u201d he said. </p> <p>\u201cWe didn\u2019t raise it with the new mayor or deputy mayor. I\u2019ve already acknowledged that probably, with retrospect, we didn\u2019t anticipate the response because we didn\u2019t think it was such a big issue. But clearly for people it has been.\u201d</p> <p>Martha Spurrier, the director of Liberty, earlier this month described spit hoods as \u201cprimitive, cruel and degrading\u201d tools. \u201cSpit hoods belong in horror stories, not on the streets of a civilised society. We urge the Met police to think again,\u201d she said.</p>",
  "<p>There are very few issues in Washington that can enthusiastically unite a Republican congressman like Jason Chaffetz and a Democratic one like Elijah Cummings. But this week, one woman <a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/mylan-ceo-heather-bresch-house-oversight-committee-hearing-epipen-2016-9\">has managed</a> to get them both on the same page: Heather Bresch, the CEO of Mylan, maker of the EpiPen, a life-saving drug for those who have severe allergies. Both lawmakers questioned the ethics of Mylan\u2019s pricing and dismissed Bresch\u2019s attempts to defend the company.</p> <p>Bresch, who made $18.9m in 2015, is weathering some justifiably sharp scrutiny right now due to the fact that her company hiked the cost of EpiPens to $608 a pack, or almost 600%, in a few short years. This despite the fact the product has been on the market for decades and contains an active ingredient that costs about $1. The consequences of the price hikes are very real, restricting access to lifesaving medicine for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/25/epipen-price-increase-mylan\">families like mine</a>, who have a child with a life-threatening allergy. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/29/epipen-price-drug-monopolies-mylan\">Who is to blame for the EpiPen hike? Drug monopolies \u2013 not evil CEOs | Colin Holtz</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Public officials were aghast at learning of the extent of Mylan\u2019s greed. Many blushed at Bresch\u2019s audacity in recent weeks as she refused to lower the inflated price by even a dollar and dared to go straight to the corporate crisis playbook of muddying the waters and claiming that outraged consumers were simply \u201cconfused\u201d. As the parent of a child who relies on this lifesaving medication, I would like to assure Ms Bresch that I understand the situation quite clearly.</p> <p>Lawmakers responded by calling for Bresch to testify to explain her company\u2019s actions, which <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/sep/21/epipen-price-hike-mylan-ceo-congress-heather-bresch\">she did</a> Wednesday afternoon before the House oversight and government reform committee. <br></p> <p>She began her defense by asserting her company\u2019s right to make a profit, which is not in dispute. She is resolute that Mylan is elegantly threading a needle of corporate responsibility, <a href=\"http://bigstory.ap.org/article/adc4ba3d8d9f4228b7f9faa6e0625d8f/mylan-ceo-set-defend-epipen-prices-amid-public-outcry\">saying</a>: \u201cPrice and access exist in a balance, and we believe we have struck that balance.\u201d</p> <p>I\u2019m not sure the American families reliant on the EpiPen feel that way. After the news of EpiPen\u2019s price inflation hit last month, many parents shared their families\u2019 stories of straining to meet the growing cost of their child\u2019s essential medication. Some said that they send their children to school with expired syringes, hoping that the medication is still effective, a practice one parent compared to playing \u201c<a href=\"http://www.wsj.com/articles/mylans-epipen-price-increases-highlight-its-grip-on-the-market-1472154769\">Russian roulette</a>\u201d with her child\u2019s health. Others told of making the difficult decision about whether to pay the <a href=\"http://www.pbs.org/newshour/rundown/as-epipen-prices-skyrocket-consumers-and-emts-resort-to-syringes-for-life-threatening-allergies/\">mortgage</a> or for their child\u2019s EpiPen. Mylan\u2019s version of \u201cbalance\u201d has nearly knocked many families off their feet.<br></p> <p>Bresch went on to suggest that her company, which has full discretion and autonomy to make any pricing decision it wants, is raising the cost of EpiPens because of forces out of its control. \u201cThe irony is the system incentivizes high prices,\u201d <a href=\"http://www.wsj.com/articles/mylans-epipen-price-increases-highlight-its-grip-on-the-market-1472154769\">she said</a>, blaming insurance companies and drug benefit managers. This is a bogus defense, considering drug price hikes like the ones she has presided over are very much part of the equation that raises the costs in the entire health sector for consumers. </p> <p>For instance, even if the point-of-purchase price is subsidized by insurance providers, those companies do not simply eat the cost in an act of charity. They pass it on to consumers in the form of higher premiums or copays. Bresch can throw up her hands if she wants, but actions like hers are exactly what makes the American healthcare system so distorted. </p> <p>Bresch has also tried minimizing the gains made from selling the EpiPen, saying that her company only makes $50 a syringe. That may be the case, but the profits are still obscene, unfettered by the coupons the company makes available to some consumers or their plan to suddenly innovate a generic version of the drug. Mylan produces hundreds of products, but EpiPen drives a full <a href=\"http://www.wsj.com/articles/epipen-maker-mylan-tied-executive-pay-to-aggressive-profit-targets-1472722204\">10% of the company\u2019s profits</a>. </p> <p>Some of the largest swings in price have occurred since Mylan was given the gift of a monopoly over the market when Sanofi was recently forced to pull its alternative from market shelves. This is clearly not a company doing what\u2019s necessary to keep its doors open while it recoups the cost of research and development. The company did not even create the EpiPen and expects to reap <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-09-23/how-marketing-turned-the-epipen-into-a-billion-dollar-business\">$1.1bn</a> in profits in 2016.</p> <p>I called our pharmacist before the start of school this year, to see if my kindergartener could use an alternative product to one made by Mylan. I was told that none were available. So I hung up the phone, defeated, along with countless other parents across the country who have our backs against the wall as we continue to line Bresch\u2019s pockets to keep our children safe.</p>",

What does &quot;can't afford to live independently from their parents&quot; mean? I'm not questioning that it might be true, but I would be interested in seeing that statement unpicked. Does it mean can't in fact afford the rent, fuel and food bills to live independently from their parents, or does it mean can't afford to live at the standard they are used to living at independently from their parents? My home comfort level dropped when I left home many years ago. The places in which I rented a share were invariably cold, cramped and a walk from transport because that made them cheaper. I had no money left over at the end of the month after paying out for basics and for many years few possessions, which made packing easier when moving on to the next rental. I accepted this as the price I paid for independence. Do young people now accept or not accept that there is a price to be paid for independence?</p></div> </div> </div>  </figure>  <p>However, I would say that nowadays it\u2019s easy to feel trapped and I think that\u2019s the difference. Maybe back in the day you would pay a certain price for independence but eventually you would be able to afford something nicer, as you progressed in your career. The challenge now is that people live in awful conditions for much of their 30s even, and affording a house is literally an impossible dream, so actually it\u2019s much easier to move back home and save, making that sacrifice to ensure that you might one day be able to live truly independently. I would like to hear what other people think about this question though.<br></p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-09-22T12:04:44.663Z\">at 1.04pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57e3c1aee4b05d653ca5f95b\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/james-walsh\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-22T11:39:25.137Z\">12.39pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Have this generation had it considerably tougher than that of their parents?

  "<h2> New violence hits Charlotte</h2> <p>A second night of unrest has spread across Charlotte, North Carolina, following the fatal police shooting of Keith Scott, a 43-year-old black man. A man was critically wounded during last night\u2019s unrest in what authorities called a \u201ccivilian on civilian\u201d confrontation.

Protesters held signs that read \u201crelease the tape\u201d, referring to police video of the shooting that started the protests.

  "<p>Claudia Rankine, whose award-winning poetry collection Citizen explores the stories of black Americans encountering everyday racism, has been awarded a MacArthur \u201cgenius grant\u201d worth $625,000 (\u00a3475,000).</p> <p>Praised as \u201ca critical voice in current conversations about racial violence\u201d, Rankine is one of 23 people chosen by the MacArthur Foundation as a 2016 fellow. The fellowships come with a stipend of $625,000, paid out over the next five years, and are intended to allow the recipients to \u201cexercise their own creative instincts for the benefit of human society\u201d.</p> <p>In an interview with the MacArthur foundation, Rankine said that Citizen \u201cbegan as a response to events happening in American culture\u201d, with the first piece written immediately after Hurricane Katrina. \u201cI recorded all of the CNN coverage and was fascinated by how racism coloured the reporting. After that, I began to respond to events that caught the public imagination \u2013 mostly things like police shooting of unarmed black men and other pieces of blatant injustice that clearly were tied to racism,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Rankine told <a href=\"http://time.com/4503473/claudia-rankine-MacArthur-fellow\">Time magazine</a> that she intended to use the grant to set up a \u201cRacial Imaginary Institute\u201d, which would enable creative thinkers \u201cto come together in a kind of laboratory environment to talk about the making of art and culture and \u2026 the dismantling of white dominance\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cWhat seemed, before the MacArthur, like this thing that we wanted to do but which seemed more abstract, suddenly has come more into focus,\u201d she said.</p> <p>\u201cWhat we know is that for many white people, black people are coupled with criminality in their imagination. That\u2019s an equation for the white imagination. And they can\u2019t get beyond it. And part of the reason I believe they can\u2019t get beyond it is because they don\u2019t see the construction of it. I think we are in need of an institute that does the work of investigating and bringing forward those things that have been made absent or erased inside the culture around white dominance.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/jun/29/poet-claudia-rankine-invisibility-black-women-everyday-racism-citizen\">Poet Claudia Rankine: \u2018The invisibility of black women is astounding\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Alongside a sculptor and a human rights lawyer, a microbiologist and a jewellery maker, the MacArthur Foundation also chose the writer Maggie Nelson to be a recipient of its grant this year.

At just 31, the Princeton-educated Jacobs-Jenkins has made a name for himself as an inventive, fresh theatre writer. Two of his works tied for Obie Awards for Best American Play and his play An Octoroon was a finalist for The Edward M Kennedy Prize for Drama Inspired by American History.

The Conservatives, in one way or another, have now been in power for six years. Their results are not that bad. The Lib Dems are making some progress, and in a number of byelections significant progress. But for the main opposition party in England to be losing seats net is pretty bad.</p> </blockquote> <p>Travers also said the Lib Dems were doing very well in some seats.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>They are not doing that well in the opinion polls, but they are doing surprisingly well, or certainly surprisingly, compared to the 2015 general election debacle at the local level. Not in every seat, but in a number of seats, and particularly against Labour, it must be said. They are getting swings of 10, 20 even 30% from one party to the other. So I think they can realistically say, although these are straws in the wind, that there are some straws.</p> </blockquote> <p>Asked if the Lib Dem local council byelection performance provided the basis for a fightback, Travers said it was \u201cthe basis for a basis\u201d. In the past the Lib Dems had won parliamentary seats by building up their strength at council level, he said.

Corbyn has filled the leader\u2019s office with people strongly committed to his brand of politics, but most staff at Labour HQ are not seen as committed Corbynistas.</p> <p>Staff working for the party are represented by GMB and Unite and their convenors, Jim Harvey and Tim Waters, wrote to Corbyn on Monday this week asking him to \u201cpledge your support for unionised Labour Party workers\u201d. Interestingly, they cited Theresa May\u2019s commitment to putting workers on company boards as a reason why Labour staff should be represented on the NEC.</p> <p>Here\u2019s an extract from the letter:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It is disappointing that while the Tory prime minister has promised worker representation on company boards that Labour Party workers are currently unrepresented on their own executive. It is therefore only right that the Labour party should lead by example and ensure worker representation on the NEC. </p> <p>It would be deeply hypocritical of the party to espouse the importance of staff representation in other organisations and companies and not to act itself to put into practice the demands it places on others.</p> <p>According to the BBC, the Labour staff are demanding two seats on the NEC, in addition to the seat already taken by the party\u2019s general secretary Iain McNicol. </p> </blockquote> <p>In reply <strong>Jeremy Corbyn</strong> said that he was \u201cfully committed to open and transparent consultation with trade unions on all matters relating to members of staff\u201d and that no staff changes were currently being proposed. He said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>As a lifelong and committed trade unionist myself, and as leader of the Labour party, I want to make it absolutely clear that I, and my senior management team, are not supportive of any compulsory redundancies. </p> <p>At this stage, no changes to staff have been proposed and nor would they ever be outside of the context of a properly structured change management programme will full trade union engagement. </p> <p>I would ask that you please disregard any anonymous or unsourced press briefings which suggest otherwise.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57e3a759e4b080d3ee88b41c\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-22T09:44:09.172Z\">10.44am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Bank of England warns of 'challenging period of uncertainty' after Brexit</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The <strong>Bank of England</strong> has warned over a \u201cchallenging\u201d outlook for financial stability in the UK as the nation faces \u201cuncertainty and adjustment\u201d following the Brexit vote, the Press Association reports.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The Bank\u2019s financial policy committee (FPC) said that while the financial system has been resilient since the decision to quit the EU, there were concerns over the impact on the UK\u2019s public finances, commercial property and over-indebted borrowers. </p> <p>But it said bank capital standards will not be relaxed following Brexit, telling lenders they could expect rules \u201cat least as great as that currently planned\u201d. </p> <p>The FPC also dashed the prospect of the Help to Buy mortgage scheme being extended, saying its closure as planned at the end of the year would not cause lending to dry up. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/Pages/news/2016/033.aspx\">In minutes of the FPC\u2019s meeting earlier this week</a>, it cautioned: \u201cAlthough financial stability has been maintained in the UK through a period of volatility, and a number of economic indicators have picked up from their post-referendum low points, the UK faces a challenging period of uncertainty and adjustment.\u201d </p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57e3a437e4b05d653ca5f8b9\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-22T09:39:24.195Z\">10.39am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>A source in the Owen Smith camp has described John Mann\u2019s claim about Smith plotting a leadership bid at the start of the year as \u201cnonsense\u201d.

Here are the key points.</p> <ul> <li><strong>Mann accuses Owen Smith of running a terrible campaign against Jeremy Corbyn.</strong></li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Wrong man, wrong time, wrong policies. Owen Smith\u2019s leadership campaigned boiled down to one key message: I am not him. Never has a Labour leadership candidate hit so many bum notes in one campaign. Yet it was so predictable.</p> </blockquote> <p>Mann also claims that Smith was plotting a leadership challenge at the start of the year. \u201cI was approached at the beginning of 2016 by a senior figure promoting his candidature,\u201d Mann writes. This appears to contradict Smith\u2019s claim that he only decided to run against Corbyn when Angela Eagle launched a leadership challenge, although it is possible that Smith was planning a leadership challenge at the start of the year expecting it to happen much later. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/sep/19/corbyn-labour-leadership-says-huge-turnout-at-his-rallies-shows-he-can-win-an-election-politics-live?page=with:block-57dfd77be4b09322c33b7c4a#block-57dfd77be4b09322c33b7c4a\">He told the Guardian recently that Corbyn should have been given longer before being challenged.</a></p> <ul> <li><strong>He describes Corbyn as \u201cthe ultimate Westminster insider\u201d and says his real weakness is his \u201cstatism\u201d.</strong></li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The real weakness of Jeremy\u2019s politics is its statism. Jeremy is for the state, preferably run by people like him, doing good things for people. The antidote to this is for a party that embraces the enabling state, where people are empowered to take responsibility themselves and markets are free and open. The mirror opposite of Venezuela in other words.</p> <p>Those whose experience of life is that of the special advisor have never, in their own bubble, succeeded in comprehending this and it lends further credence to Jeremy who can pose as the outsider. However, it\u2019s also Jeremy\u2019s big dilemma, for he knows that he is the ultimate Westminster insider and has been as uncomfortable embracing a real diversity of views and experiences as his opponents have been.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>Mann says Labour is out of touch with the working class.</strong></li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Labour loves staying inside its comfort zone, battling for irrelevant positions, talking to itself, sympathising with those living in poverty, articulating outrage. But it is terrified of the working class because it might say things they don\u2019t want to hear.</p> </blockquote> <p>A leave supporter, Mann also says he does not accept the claim that most Labour voters backed remain in the EU referendum.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>When Jeremy, citing one poll by Lord Ashcroft, wrongly claims that two thirds of Labour voters supported Remain, his supporters and opponents gleefully nod in harmony. Nothing unites Labour more than false comfort about the electorate.</p> <p>Any mathematician can quickly work out that in fact Labour areas were the strongest to vote Leave and any well organised party, sampling ballot boxes, will know that in Labour areas it was the Tory voters who tended to vote Remain and it was large blocks of Labour trade unionists who voted Leave.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>He tips Chuka Umunna, Dan Jarvis and Lisa Nandy as potential future leaders.</strong></li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The next contest will probably be after the next election. Whatever he says now, Jeremy will not stay on if he loses. Only three current MPs have the potential to embrace this wider world. Chuka Umunna, if he can tame his Euro fanaticism; Dan Jarvis, if he can stop acting as a traditional politician; and Lisa Nandy, if she can stay in touch with her constituents.

It then fashions an explanation: that the compromise is based on bad motives. It then develops a theory: that the trajectory of our country has been unchanged by Labour government since the Thatcher years. It then creates a new version of history: there is no difference between Labour and Tory governments. This is the sectarianism that leads to the dead end of permanent opposition.</p> </blockquote> <p>In his article Miliband does not offer a specific programme for what Labour should do to regain power.

The Commons is in recess, and the main political parties are getting ready for their party conferences. Labour\u2019s starts at the weekend and, to mark it, the New Statesman has published a special edition, leading with <a href=\"http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/uk/2016/09/new-times-david-miliband-why-left-needs-move-forward-not-back\">an article by <strong>David Miliband,</strong> the former Labour foreign secretary,</a> despairing at what has happened to his party. Like the Ode to Autumn (which an academic on Today said was partially <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2008/jan/11/isnttoautumnaboutautumn\">influenced by the aftermath of the Peterloo massacre)</a>, Miliband\u2019s article laments loss. But, unlike the Ode, it\u2019s not great poetry, and it\u2019s much more specific.</p> <p>Miliband makes the routine claim (for people from his wing of the party) that Jeremy Corbyn is \u201cunelectable\u201d, but he gives the argument a new twist. Rather than claiming that Corbyn\u2019s policy objectives are fine, but that Corbyn is just the wrong person to be able to implement them (which broadly was Owen Smith\u2019s argument in the leadership contest, with some exceptions), Miliband says that Corbyn has the wrong policies.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The party has ended up pre-New Labour in policy and culture, when we need to be post-New Labour. This year\u2019s leadership election has spent a lot of time debating how to \u201cbring back\u201d various lost icons, such as nationalised railways, rather than focusing on new ideas for the future. </p> <p>The main charge against Jeremy Corbyn is not just that his strategy is undesirable because it makes the party unelectable. That is only half the story. The real issue is that his strategy makes the party unelectable because it is in many aspects undesirable.</p> <p>This is true most egregiously with regard to foreign policy. The half-hearted message about Europe is a betrayal of millions of working people. The equivocation on Nato in the face of Russia\u2019s intimidation of nations in her former sphere of influence is dangerous and throws away progressive values.</p> <p>But the electorate can see through the domestic policy, too. Nationalisation cannot be the answer to everything; anti-austerity speeches cannot explain everything; corporate taxation cannot pay for everything. It doesn\u2019t add up. It wouldn\u2019t work. People are not stupid.</p> </blockquote> <p>I will post more from the interview shortly.</p> <p>As usual, I will be covering the breaking political news as it happens, as well as bringing you the best reaction, comment and analysis from the web.

  "<p>Food, clothing, electrical goods, energy \u2013 everything we consume has a hidden water footprint.

Here\u2019s what we learned.</p> <h2>1 Recognise the value of water</h2> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>[There] is a lack of appreciation of the value of water \u2013 or it is taken for granted \u2013 and the scarce resource is then being wasted.</p> </blockquote> <p>When this happens, says Andr\u00e9 Fourie, head of water security and environmental value at SABMiller, it leads to an underinvestment in water infrastructure and services, especially those dealing with wastewater and pollution.</p> <h2>2 Measure it</h2> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>If you don\u2019t measure, you can\u2019t manage.</p> </blockquote> <p>This point was made by Dexter Galvin, head of the supply chain programme at CDP. Galvin admits it may sound obvious, but the basics of water accounting \u2013 from withdrawals, to usage, to discharge \u2013 are key for companies. </p> <p>While water auditing and monitoring are essential first steps when identifying water use, it\u2019s vital to distinguish between direct and indirect water use. Direct water use can be simply and efficiently measured in-house. Indirect water usage is harder since it extends beyond the company fences.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2016/sep/13/water-global-shortages-gdp-agriculture-factories-textiles-investors\">How can we better value water as global shortages start to threaten economies?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The experts recommend using existing tools to help with this, such as <a href=\"http://www.wrap.org.uk/content/rippleffect\" rel=\"nofollow\">the WRAP Rippleffect programme</a>. In addition, Galvin says the very process of gathering data from suppliers, through a global standard like CDP, leads to better management.</p> <h2>3 Engage suppliers on water management</h2> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Getting farmers engaged was key for our Spanish strawberry project. Without their involvement we had nothing \u2013 no access to data and no farms to trial new practices. </p> </blockquote> <p>These are the words of Jessica Sansom, head of sustainability at Innocent Drinks.

It was crucial that Innocent addressed the wider impact of water reduction on the strawberry farmers\u2019 livelihoods, which meant they had to consider how to reduce water consumption in a way that was low cost, and that also retained the same yields and quality. </p> <p>The panel also discussed financial incentives and educational support as other ways to help engage suppliers. </p> <h2>4 Use new technology</h2> <p>Aaron Burton, the director of projects and programmes at Waterwise, predicts that adopting new technologies will be key to helping companies reduce water consumption: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>smart metering and big data can help organisations from SMEs to large corporations better understand and manage water use.</p> </blockquote> <p>Water companies can play a role in trialling and demonstrating innovative technologies, says Burton. For example, a Thames Water <a href=\"http://http//www.watefnetwork.co.uk/files/default/resources/Conference2016/Session_Four/48-TUCKER.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">trial</a> (pdf) at its offices in Reading saw the company replace its duel-flush toilets, taps and urinals with water efficient equivalents, enabling an 83% reduction in water use. The company calculated that were all the bathrooms in the office block refurbished in the same way, it could save 4.8m litres of water and \u00a39,950 in water costs per year. </p> <h2>5 Ensure internal buy-in</h2> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Unless the top level management in any business sees the business case to act, it is not going to happen.</p> </blockquote> <p>Understanding water related risk is key to ensuring internal buy-in, says Ashok Chapagain, science director of the Water Footprint Network. </p> <p>There are three kinds: the physical risk of not getting the quality or quantity of water required for current operations or for future expansion; the regulatory risk arising from changes in legislation in the region; and the reputational risk arising from not managing water use responsibly.</p> <h2>6 Collaborate</h2> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>A collaborative approach is key.</p> </blockquote> <p>A company can take steps to reduce its water use in a specific watershed, says Eliza Roberts, manager of the water programme of Ceres, but if it doesn\u2019t work collaboratively with other companies and stakeholders then it may not succeed in mitigating the risks it is exposed to in that watershed</p> <p>Sansom agrees: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Partnership is absolutely key.

Better to legalise it | Simon Jenkins</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Over 140,000 of Africa\u2019s savannah elephants were killed between 2007 and 2014, wiping out almost a third of their population, according to a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/aug/31/poaching-drives-huge-30-decline-in-africas-savannah-elephants\">major survey published in August</a>. Just 350,000 remain, with poaching continuing today and an elephant being killed every 15 minutes on average.</p> <p>The letter\u2019s signatories include Richard Leakey, Joaquin Phoenix, Tim Farron, Caroline Lucas, Ed Miliband and Richard Dawkins, plus 19 more MPs from across the parties. The letter was coordinated by <a href=\"http://actionforelephantsuk.org/\">Action for Elephants UK</a> before the government announced its ban on modern ivory sales and ahead of <a href=\"http://march4elephantsandrhinos.org/\">protest marches in the UK and around the world</a> on Saturday.</p> <p>In an addendum to the letter, Maria Mossman from Action for Elephants UK, said: \u201cThe crackdown on ivory sales announced by the government does not represent the total ban we are calling for. It simply tightens controls on the documentation of ivory for sale, however no mechanisms could ever ensure that such controls were met and enforced for every single piece of ivory sold in the UK. As long as a legal ivory trade is allowed to continue, illegal ivory will find its way on to the market \u2013 and the scourge of poaching will continue.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe are dismayed that the government has chosen this route rather than announcing a complete ban and demonstrating the kind of leadership so urgently needed for a global ban on ivory,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Environment secretary, Andrea Leadsom, who announced the ban on UK sales of post-1947 ivory items, said on Wednesday: \u201cElephants are some of our world\u2019s most iconic animals and it will take truly global action to stop the insidious criminals who selfishly prosper from the ivory trade. This [UK] ban will send the message that the ivory trade is a thing of the past.\u201d It was already illegal in the UK to trade in raw tusks or unworked ivory of any age.</p> <p>A coalition of conservation groups, including the Zoological Society of London (ZSL), Tusk, Environmental Investigation Agency, Wildlife Conservation Society and WildAid, have also criticised the new restrictions on the UK ivory trade as inadequate.</p> <p>\u201cThe announcement is welcome but falls short of what is needed,\u201d said the groups in a joint statement. \u201cBy focusing on \u2018modern day ivory\u2019, the government has overlooked the huge problem of worked ivory dated prior to 1947, which makes up the vast majority of the market. The government must recognise that a near-total ban would be the most effective step the UK can take to protect the future of elephants. Failure to do so will mean the UK neither meets its international commitments nor represents public opinion.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMaintaining domestic ivory markets helps fuel the illegal killing of thousands of elephants,\u201d said Prof Jonathan Baillie, director of conservation programmes at the ZSL. The US implemented a ban on ivory sales in July, following France\u2019s in April, while China, the major market for ivory, has imposed a three-year ban on ivory imports.</p> <p>In a statement to be read at Saturday\u2019s marches, the foreign secretary Boris Johnson, said: \u201cThe elephant is perhaps the single greatest glory of the animal kingdom. It is utterly heartbreaking that their numbers are falling so far and so fast.

  "<p>British manufacturers have enjoyed rising output and a steady flow of new orders over the past three months, according to a survey that will buoy hopes that the Brexit vote did not deliver an immediate blow to businesses.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.cbi.org.uk/news/manufacturing-output-continues-expanding-at-healthy-pace/\">The CBI\u2019s monthly check on the factory sector</a>also found that manufacturers\u2019 expectations for the next three months had picked up sharply despite a dip in export orders. </p> <p>The survey of 481 manufacturers echoed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/sep/21/post-referendum-gloom-fears-confounded-economic-evidence\">the upbeat tone of other recent indicators</a> suggesting activity had rebounded from an initial slump after the 23 June referendum. </p> <p>The CBI said output growth continued \u201cat the same brisk pace\u201d in the three months to September as seen in August, driven predominantly by the food and drink sector. Over the three months to December, manufacturers expect the rate of production to accelerate rapidly. </p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s good to see that manufacturers are enjoying a lingering summer with output running at a strong pace and manufacturers\u2019 order books remaining solid, particularly amongst the food, drink and motor vehicles sectors,\u201d said the CBI\u2019s chief economist, Rain Newton-Smith.</p> <p>\u201cBut there are plenty of challenges ahead for manufacturers as we adjust to a new relationship with the EU and the rest of the world.\u201d</p> <p>She urged the chancellor, Philip Hammond, to help manufacturers by promoting investment and innovation in his <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/08/philip-hammond-announces-autumn-budget-statement-for-23-november\">autumn statement in November</a>, when he will set out how the government will use tax and spending measures to shore up the post-referendum economy. </p> <p>The group\u2019s latest report on manufacturing described total order books as \u201ccomfortably above their long-run average\u201d. Export order books declined, but similarly remained historically high. <br></p> <p>The survey uses balances to convey manufacturers\u2019 mood, order books and output. It showed 18% of businesses reported total orders to be above normal and 22% below normal, giving a rounded balance of -5%. That was in line with the consensus forecast in a Reuters poll of economists and unchanged from August\u2019s survey.</p> <p>The output balance for the last three months held at +11%, while the balance of output expectations for the coming three months jumped to +22% from +11%.</p> <p>As the Bank of England watches for signs of inflation picking up as a result of the weak pound and <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/04/bank-of-england-cuts-uk-interest-rates\">record low interest rates</a>, the survey showed firms\u2019 expectations for selling price inflation were reined in marginally from an 18-month high. Seventy-five per cent of respondents expect no change over the next three months. </p> <p>The CBI said there were signs that the weaker pound, which fell sharply after the Brexit vote, was helping exporters. \u201cOur members tell us and our surveys show that the fall in sterling has boosted international competitiveness for many businesses, with export order books remaining well above average in September, despite weakening slightly,\u201d said Newton-Smith.</p> <p>Chemical firms experienced the sharpest drop in overseas demand, while the motor vehicle and transport sector reported the greatest improvement. </p>",

This teaser would be much improved if the guy had turned to camera and carefully contextualised the moment for us, explaining who he is and why he just shot a meal in full view of the public.

  "<p>As darkness descends over the imposing green mountains on the outskirts of Mexico City, Luz Reality, a 32-year-old rapper, steps under a faded orange tarp and through a metal security door into the underground venue. Though a veteran of the city\u2019s hip-hop scene, she admits she still gets unnerved by the constant threat of assault in the areas around Ecatepec\u2019s clandestine concert venues.</p> <p>In recent months, this <em>barrio</em> has been plagued by a grisly series of abductions and murders. In one case, a woman was found burned on an empty patch of grass. The victim somehow survived the brutal attack and was still alive when police found her, but died later from her injuries.</p> <p>As is almost always the case in Ecatepec, the murder went unsolved. People here know better than to expect investigations and arrests \u2013 but lately the neighbourhood has been on edge. Frustrated with the violence, residents have banded together to beat and publicly shame alleged criminals on several occasions.</p> <p>Tonight, Luz couldn\u2019t even find a taxi driver willing to drop her off at the venue for her show: an empty Ecatepec lot. She had to walk from the main avenue down desolate streets where kidnappings can happen unnoticed.</p> <p>The neighbourhood has become regarded as Mexico\u2019s \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/27/mexico-city-plastic-whistles-sexual-assault\">capital of violence against women</a>\u201d. Luz knows the stories about women disappearing, but tries not to let fear limit her life. Since 2012, on average more than one woman has been killed every week in Ecatepec, and last year this violence escalated.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>The dynamic is similar to what happened in in the northern border city of Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez, just south of the Texas border, in the early 1990s. Earlier this month a Spanish woman was kidnapped from a wealthy area of the city, killed and dumped in a canal in the state of Mexico. Between 2005 and 2015, no fewer than 3,604 women were killed in the state of Mexico, where Ecatepec is located. It\u2019s an alarming trend \u2013 yet each individual murder is just another statistic that barely gets mentioned in the capital\u2019s biggest newspapers.</p> <p>Not formally part of Mexico City, Ecatepec is a residential area that has grown in fits and bursts. A generation of people from the countryside came to settle here in the 1980s and 90s, trying to carve a niche for themselves on the fringe of Mexico\u2019s rapidly transforming, globalised economy.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"66360feec6dda01418fd07722231d41d5fcdc263\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/66360feec6dda01418fd07722231d41d5fcdc263/123_80_3137_1883/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A man hangs up a banner showing photographs of missing and dead women in Ecatepec.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A man hangs a banner showing photographs of missing and dead women in Ecatepec.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Henry Romero/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The streets surrounding the venue hosting Luz and her friends tonight are a shabby agglomeration of dull-grey cinderblock buildings, most of which were improvised one storey at a time. In contrast, the rappers look like fireworks of fluorescent pink and purple, their gold watches and neon attire shimmering over the sea of cement. </p> <p>With the bass beat thumping, Luz psyches herself up for her performance. She eyes a cadre of teenagers in t-shirts holding plastic cups of beer and Buchanan\u2019s whisky (the local favourite), who form a semi-circle in front of the small, second-storey stage. The crowd is young and riled up. In the back corner, a few scruffy men cut up lines of cocaine on a cell-phone. Inside the cement-block walls, the thumping music creates a warm refuge from the world outside.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I was proud of Ecatepec.

As she steps out to join her three rapper friends in the centre of the second-floor stage, Alix Toxik (Luz\u2019s skinny, ebullient group-mate) grabs the microphone and shouts: \u201cLadies In Tha Hood in the <em>casa</em>!\u201d<br></p> <p>Alix\u2019s beet-red hair and gold chains dance as if they are pulsating with an electric current. Then Luz steps out towards the edge of the stage and shouts: \u201cIn Mexico there are a lot of <em>femicidios</em> so this song is called For My Girls.\u201d</p> <p>As a manic, minimalist beat streams out of the DJ\u2019s speakers, Maya La Insana, Luz\u2019s heavyset partner in rhyme, bobs her head and unleashes a rapid-fire volley of lyrics: \u201cI don\u2019t deal with fiction, just the truth. We listen and we stay quiet. It\u2019s better to run your mouth \u2026 Where are the people who want to criticise me? [The people] who want to finish me off?\u201d <br></p> <p>In the crowd, a menacing, broad-shouldered man in black clothes and sun-glasses holds up his smart phone to take video, while a group of teenage boys rises from their refuge along the cement wall to watch the performance.<br></p> <p>To the side of the stage, Luz and Alix dance frenetically to the energetic beat, jumping up to rap in unison for the song\u2019s chorus: \u201cI still help my girls in the street; I still help my girls on the stage!\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"8ea03b50d3ef4131f98b766acda6ab9c526ab5f1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8ea03b50d3ef4131f98b766acda6ab9c526ab5f1/0_0_3100_1860/1000.jpg\" alt=\"High heel shoes are seen in front of a cross outside the Municipal Palace of Ecatepec during a protest against femicides.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">High heel shoes are seen in front of a cross outside the Municipal Palace of Ecatepec during a protest against the murders of women.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Anadolu Agency/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Even with a few technical difficulties, the show is a welcome respite from what has been a difficult period in Ecatepec. A few weeks earlier, an entire family was dismembered and stuffed into bags in the railyard that runs through the neighbourhood. In another incident, two policemen were killed during their lunch break.</p> <p>For 20 years, though, rap has helped Luz process the world around her. She first heard about it as a teen in the early 1990s. Her friends\u2019 families came from different parts of Mexico, so hip-hop became the common chord that tied them together.</p> <p>****</p> <p>Ecatepec exploded as a byproduct of Mexico\u2019s shift from a corrupt, state-led development strategy based on protectionism and nepotism to the current paradigm of neoliberal economic policy and export promotion. Subsidies that had supported small-time agriculture were dismantled, so poor, rural residents flooded down from the mountains into the valley in Mexico City.</p> <p>As Mexico\u2019s economy dipped into crisis and nearly collapsed, the newcomers found themselves in a precarious position. Families built small shacks using found materials and the neighbourhood expanded up into the hills. In 1995 Mexico\u2019s economy imploded, leaving hundreds of thousands of workers competing for jobs in the informal economy \u2013 hawking sodas at stoplights, selling tacos from carts or working as foot soldiers in Mexico City\u2019s expanding criminal enterprises. As kidnappings surged to unprecedented levels and every day was marked by multiple homicides, it became known as the world\u2019s most dangerous city.</p> <p>In this environment, Luz and her friends learned to navigate the streets, shopping for hip-hop cassettes at open-air markets called <em>tianguis</em> and finding solace in the bravado of early-90s gangster rap. Cypress Hill were Luz\u2019s favourite group; the lyrics helped her take ownership over a difficult environment.</p> <p><em>Where I\u2019m from, the [guns] be smoking / I\u2019ll be damned if you think I\u2019m jokin\u2019 / Know that I\u2019ll come with the static, erratic, .45 automatic</em>. It\u2019s is a Cypress Hill verse that was written about LA, but also reflected the mentality in Ecatepec. Luz was inspired; she started penning her own raps to Cypress Hill beats, but tried to find a way to forge her own version. \u201cWe\u2019re not <em>chicanas</em> [Mexican-Americans],\u201d she explains.</p> <p>As the decades passed, families have replaced cardboard and sheet metal with sturdy cement bricks and added multiple storeys to their homes. In a parallel trend, Mexico City has seen a boom of real-estate investment and a new wave of renovation. Now the city centre is filled with the hulking skeletons of new skyscrapers, and upper-middle class neighbourhoods are enjoying a surge of new construction and rehabilitation.</p> <p>As infrastructure and security have improved, Mexico City has become recognised as a major hub of cultural activity. The New York Times <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/01/07/travel/places-to-visit.html?_r=0\">named the capital</a> as the top place to visit in 2016. </p> <p>The situation on the periphery of the city, however, is less stable.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"de1087b6eb6d9d35656f26f2dd10525a60d4b4b5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/de1087b6eb6d9d35656f26f2dd10525a60d4b4b5/0_0_5184_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Luz Reality stands next to graffiti on the outskirts of Mexico City.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Luz Reality stands next to graffiti on the outskirts of Mexico City.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nathaniel Parish Flannery</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cNow in the parks there are drug addicts, robberies,\u201d Luz explains. \u201cMost people go to Mexico City to work; they don\u2019t work here.\u201d</p> <p> The US Chamber of Commerce in Mexico ranks Ecatepec as the second most challenging security environment for businesses in the country. According to this analysis, the suburb trails only Reynosa, Tamaulipas \u2013 the border city that serves as a base for the notorious Zeta cartel \u2013 in terms of security problems.</p> <p>Ecatepec has evolved since the early 90s, but in many ways it hasn\u2019t improved. \u201cEven though there are malls now, they don\u2019t help. It\u2019s ugly and violent, and is no place to raise kids,\u201d Luz says. <br></p> <p>\u201cI was proud of Ecatepec. [But now,] if I had the chance to leave, I would. I don\u2019t see a future here,\u201d she says.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>After 7pm you don\u2019t go out. Not in car, walking, or in taxi</p> <footer> <cite>Luz Reality</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>A number of multinational companies have built new factories in Ecatepec, but Luz has never worked at any of them. \u201cThe shifts are long and pay is low. To work you have to go to Mexico City or find self-employment selling things at the markets,\u201d she says.<br></p> <p>After she saw a female colleague get kidnapped, Luz left a job teaching kindergarten for a post at a small stationery store near the main plaza. While she has friends who have found jobs in IT and marketing departments in the steel and glass skyscrapers downtown, Luz herself \u2013 like nearly 60% of the women in Ecaptepec \u2013 works in the sprawling, informal economy, in a job that doesn\u2019t include benefits.</p> <p>Ecatepec is now home to 1.6 million people, more than half of whom live below the poverty line. Too many aspects of life here still feel improvised and incomplete. There may police patrols on the wide throughways, but on the side streets security is scarce.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"f025b4494b85af32953c53c0d830bcc00cd06584\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f025b4494b85af32953c53c0d830bcc00cd06584/0_173_5184_3110/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Luz pulls on a pair of headphones while recording a rap video in the main plaza in Ecatepec.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Luz pulls on a pair of headphones while recording a rap video in the main plaza in Ecatepec.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nathaniel Parish Flannery</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>A few weeks after the concert, Luz meets up with bandmates Alix and Maya at a pizza place. The women have broken their self-imposed curfew to have a celebratory dinner to mark the end of a successful day recording a video.</p> <p>In the afternoon, they revel in the activity in the bustling square, rapping to the camera in the golden afternoon light. The plaza brings together old men who have spent decades working in the fields with young parents taking their toddlers to watch the clowns, with teens on BMX bikes and skateboards. As is the case in small towns in the mountains, Ecatepec\u2019s main plaza is the centre of community life: \u201cIt\u2019s representative of Ecaptec\u2019s culture. You\u2019ve got the skaters, the rappers, the B-boys,\u201d Luz explains.</p> <p>As night sets in, Luz and her band-mates bounce in front of big graffiti murals down the street from Luz\u2019s house, using a friend\u2019s car headlights to illuminate the last few shots of the day. With the camera off, the swagger subsides quickly.<br></p> <p>The pizza restaurant\u2019s windows and doors are made of heavy steel bars that look strong enough to stop a truck from crashing through. Although a few people gather at a nearby taco restaurant and a food truck still stands down the road, mostly the streets are empty.</p> <p></p> <p>Luz ties Ecatepec\u2019s hip-hop culture to the <em>cholo</em> culture popularised by Mexican-Americans in early-90s California, Cypress Hill among them. She and the rest of her generation are still wedded to these traditions of DJing, rapping, graffiti art, and breakdancing. </p> <p>But she fears the neighbourhood\u2019s younger generation is more tuned in rapping as a form of aggression \u2013 notably in rap battles \u2013 and, worse, as an ancillary activity to drug dealing. The younger rappers are less interested in painting murals or organising dance competitions and far keener to embrace criminal culture. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7ed905213a4b0bcab81c02fe390b17f5bad0ccac\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7ed905213a4b0bcab81c02fe390b17f5bad0ccac/0_346_5184_3110/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A grey graffiti mural in the Ecatepec naighbourhood.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A grey graffiti mural in the Ecatepec neighbourhood.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nathaniel Parish Flannery</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Waiting for her pizza to arrive, Luz explains: \u201cWhat I want is young people to know me. I think there are fewer rappers, fewer graffiti artists now.\u201d She sees her neighbourhood\u2019s <em>cholo</em> culture fading away. \u201cIt\u2019s dying,\u201d she says.</p> <p>The hard-edged bravado of the new generation may be more in tune with the current reality of Ecatepec, where drug gangs recruit teens and local mob bosses have turned the neighbourhood into a depot for the retail narco trade. The crime wave has overrun the local police and created a new environment of violence and impunity.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s changed a lot. Before it was safe, now it\u2019s the most dangerous municipality in Mexico state. It\u2019s the worst place in Mexico for <em>femicidios</em>,\u201d Luz explains. On 7 August, the body of a young woman was found near a canal in the nearby town of Zumpango. The victim had been raped and tortured. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of gender-based violence. I think it\u2019s getting worse,\u201d Luz says.<br></p> <p>****</p> <p>The pizza parlour is empty and playing loud <em>banda</em> music, but Alix, usually so exuberant, lowers her voice: \u201cAs a woman, when I have to go to the R\u00edo de los Remedios neighbourhood, I\u2019m scared. I have <em>amigas</em> who live there. They say that girls coming out of the subway there get kidnapped and taken away in cars. They disappear.\u201d</p> <p>The subway stop is next to a highway and few tarp-covered stands selling bootleg CDs. From the stairs that lead down from the train tracks, visitors can see a long expanse of cement buildings and only a few patches of green in the distance.<br></p> <p>\u201cIt takes a lot of risk to go on the road,\u201d says Luz softly. \u201cThey\u2019ve taken a lot of women.\u201d </p> <p>The attacks on women have been well documented by the local tabloids. In December 2015, police discovered the body of a 20-year-old, raped, and beaten to death in an empty lot in Ecatepec. In March, 2016 one of Ecatepec\u2019s own police officers fled town after torturing and killing his own girlfriend.<br></p> <p>Taking a moment to cut and serve slices of pizza, Luz says: \u201cI think it\u2019s worse than ever.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"6fa087b3f1a1c8b3aad1cd03b6cd5c5bb7c3cf9b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6fa087b3f1a1c8b3aad1cd03b6cd5c5bb7c3cf9b/0_43_5184_3110/1000.jpg\" alt=\"An activist wearing rubbish bags and rope, to replicate the way many female murder victims are found, takes part in a protest on the banks of the Remedios River, where corpses regularly wash up.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">An activist wearing rubbish bags and rope, to replicate the way female murder victims are found, takes part in a protest on the banks of the Remedios River, where corpses often wash up.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nathaniel Parish Flannery</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>She lives in a gated community with a guard who watches through a heavy metal gate. Inside, residents have built fences to separate their houses from the street, some girded with razor wire. Outside of her neighbourhood, Luz feels unsafe: \u201cAfter 7pm you don\u2019t go out. Not in car, walking, or in taxi,\u201d she says. \u201cYou can go to the supermarket and the taxi driver will rob you.\u201d</p> <p>Her brother was carjacked right in front of the security post at the entrance to her neighbourhood. \u201cThey put a gun on him and took everything he had, even his gum,\u201d Luz explains.<br></p> <p>But she continues to grind, penning lyrics and recording videos. One of her new songs, I\u2019m Still On My Feet, sums up her attitude. Over a bouncing, bass-driven beat she raps: \u201cAfter everything I\u2019ve been through, I\u2019m still on my feet. I don\u2019t let myself get beaten.\u201d</p> <p>She tries to stay positive but the situation in Ecatepec is heart-breaking: \u201c[Now] it\u2019s worse. There are more<em> femicidios</em> than Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez, more kidnappings.\u201d.</p> <p>In some cases, the violence is meted out by partners and ex-partners. In others it\u2019s organised crime, kidnapping women to force them to work in the sex trade. Other times random assaults are carried out by gangsters in a realm of impunity.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2015/nov/10/hope-in-the-heart-of-apache-territory-mexico-citys-deportivo-chavos-banda\">Hope in the heart of apache territory: Mexico City's Deportivo Chavos Banda</a> </p> </aside>  <p>On 4 September, infuriated residents banded together and cornered two thieves, beating them severely before police arrived.

It\u2019s like love-hate: I was born here, but I\u2019d like to leave.

A few weeks earlier, a group of activists had staged a demonstration by the murky Remedios River that cuts through the neighbourhood. </p> <p>Wearing trash bags around their bodies and rope around their arms (the accoutrements routinely found tied to corpses that wash up on the river\u2019s shore), they shouted in protest: \u201cThe river has become a watery grave!\u201d \u201cWomen are kidnapped and left here in trash bags!\u201d \u201cEcatepec is a tomb!\u201d</p> <p>Meanwhile the traffic zoomed by on the freeway next to the canal, truck drivers honking as they passed, drowning out the women\u2019s voices. Then a police car stopped on the side of the highway. An officer walked up to the demonstration, took a few pictures on his cell phone, and walked back down the hill to his car.</p> <p>\u201cThere are thousands of women who have disappeared. We are asking for justice!\u201d a woman shouted. The officer didn\u2019t respond. </p> <p><em>Follow Guardian Cities on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/guardiancities\">Twitter</a> and <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/guardiancities\">Facebook</a> to join the discussion</em></p>",
  "<p>Like all art, gaming is full of copycats. First-person shooters used to be known as \u201cDoom clones\u201d. There are probably as many match-3 games as there are planets in No Man\u2019s Sky. But some games are less copied than others, even when they impress critics and inspire a cult following. So it\u2019s good to see a new game that\u2019s unabashedly inspired by Blendo Games\u2019 Thirty Flights of Loving.</p> <p>Virginia may be longer than Thirty Flights, clocking in at about the length of a film, but it\u2019s similar in form. It\u2019s played in first-person, though the first scene begins with the player character in front of a mirror so you can see that she\u2019s a woman of colour: Anne Tarver, newly appointed to the FBI. You play through a week in her life in the early 90s, as she and her partner Maria Halperin investigate the case of a missing child, in a series of short scenes.</p> <p>As in Thirty Flights, you progress the narrative by exploring small environments to find something to interact with, after which the game cuts to a new scene. With the strict control the game often has over the player\u2019s perspective, these cuts are a gentler but perhaps more relevant way for games to mimic cinema than through exploding helicopters. We see Tarver\u2019s reflection in pyjamas, click to open the mirrored cabinet, and she closes it again to reveal she is dressed for work. We see a man filling the frame as he proffers coffee, click to take the cup, and when he walks away it reveals Halperin with a cold compress held to her head. Some cuts are more effective than others, but they all serve to keep up the pace.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"51c10cc061b113a59ef234c04cfe1845ccaec36a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/51c10cc061b113a59ef234c04cfe1845ccaec36a/40_0_1200_720/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Virginia screengrab: landscape\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Players progress the narrative by exploring small environments to find something to interact with.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Of course, the art style is very different. Where Thirty Flights is colourful and its characters cuboid, Virginia has a muted, painterly palette: objects are shaded in a few blocks of colour, picture frames appear empty and everyone\u2019s eyes are black. It\u2019s pretty but occasionally obtuse: I was initially confused about the story because of the visual similarity between two characters. But within these limits much meaning is still conveyed. You might not be able to see any detail on Tarver\u2019s computer screen, but you can see the empty takeout containers pile up on her kitchen counter as the week progresses. And even with those black eyes the characters make many expressive glances, which is helpful given the total lack of dialogue.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/sep/20/how-walking-sim-first-person-shooter-dear-esther\">How walking sims became as important as the first-person shooter</a> </p> </aside>  <p>While Thirty Flights featured no understandable speech, it did make use of crowd sounds. But Virginia has a much quieter mood. The small town of Kingdom is unfriendly, Tarver\u2019s boss is aloof and Halperin is withdrawn. Often the wordlessness feels appropriate to the moment, but sometimes it jars. More than once I had Tarver approach a character, her footsteps filling the silence, only for the other person not to notice; and she\u2019ll wave her hand in front of someone\u2019s face or point at things when it would\u2019ve made sense to speak.</p> <p>Still, at least the lack of talking diverts more attention to Lyndon Holland\u2019s wonderful score, which precisely matches the mood. Many players will inevitably continue to listen to it long after they\u2019ve finished the game. Performed by the City of Prague Philharmonic Orchestra, it sounds like a film score but responds to player action, rising and falling, perhaps mulling over a phrase until you make the discovery that triggers the crescendo.</p> <p>Of course, it\u2019s easier to match music to action when your game keeps such tight control on the player. Where Blendo Games\u2019 Brendon Chung says in the developer commentary for Thirty Flights of Loving that he was reluctant to disable player interaction even temporarily, Virginia is far more restrictive. The description on Steam says that \u201cyou will make decisions which irrevocably shape the course of Anne\u2019s and agent Halperin\u2019s lives\u201d, but that\u2019s only true for a very limited definition of the word \u201cdecisions\u201d. You\u2019re brought into a scene, sometimes you can walk around and sometimes you\u2019re restricted to looking at what Tarver can see from where she\u2019s sitting/standing, you search for what is usually the only thing you can click on (usefully highlighted by a change in mouse cursor), you click, an animation plays, and it cuts to the next scene. Rinse and repeat.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"756981efd123d02f669cf10b3159779d288d67c6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/756981efd123d02f669cf10b3159779d288d67c6/10_0_1200_720/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Virginia screengrab: police officer\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Virginia\u2019s cinematic aspirations are let down by a crime-focused plot that isn\u2019t particularly groundbreaking.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Fortunately those animations, mostly produced by Variable State co-founder Terry Kenny but with additional help from animation specialist Pink Kong Studios, are the best part of the game. When you have control, the camera follows the cursor like a swaying drunk, but these movements \u2013 some big, but mostly small \u2013 are smooth. And without words, they carry the story: Tarver\u2019s boss throwing a brief across his desk, a hand placed on an empty bed, a lipstick raised almost to the lips and then thrown in the bin instead. It\u2019s refreshing too to see some of these animations used to demonstrate the kinds of micro-aggressions women experience: the male co-worker who looks her up and down in the lift, the man who approaches her as she sits alone in a bar and only leaves when she shows him a wedding ring.</p> <p>Given the impact of these mundane moments, it\u2019s a shame that the game so heavily relies on the opposite: unrelatable and abstract imagery. Dream sequences abound and often offer little more than confusion. They feel like padding that distances you from the characters, perhaps intentionally. While it\u2019s enjoyable to work out what\u2019s happening without words, the plot itself isn\u2019t particularly groundbreaking.</p> <p>Sadly, games that aspire to be cinematic will inevitably draw comparisons with film, and Virginia is a narrative game without a memorable narrative. But its goals were admirable and hopefully other developers will experiment further with this format. </p> <p>Virginia might not be the next big indie favourite, but at only \u00a37 those interested in the different ways that games can tell stories should check it out anyway. And everyone else should buy it for the soundtrack alone.</p>",

Here are five simple activities that you can use to bring their personalities to the surface and create a happy, harmonious form group.</p> <h2>Where do you overlap?</h2> <p>Divide students into pairs and give them a large sheet of paper with two overlapping circles \u2013 your standard <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venn_diagram\">Venn diagram</a>. Ask students to fill the appropriate spaces with the things they do and don\u2019t have in common. Suggest they include things like shoe size, hair colour, the primary schools they attended, favourites colours, pets, achievements, places they have visited, things they find difficult. Let each pair tell the class a few of the things they found they had in common.</p> <h2>How well do we know you?</h2> <p>Prepare a selection of multiple-choice questions and answers that reveal something about your students\u2019 likes and dislikes. For example:</p> <p> Which of the following would scare you the most?<br>\u2022 a parachute jump<br>\u2022 holding a tarantula<br>\u2022 walking in a graveyard at night<br>\u2022 swimming in shark-infested waters<br></p> <p>You can turn this into a game show-style quiz where one student has to guess the answers given by another.</p> <h2>Can you negotiate?</h2> <p>Start by asking every student in the class to think what their favourite flavour crisp is. Next, ask them to find a partner and share this information. Then tell the pairs of students that they need to decide which flavour they could both eat if they had to agree on just one flavour.</p> <p>For example: if one student chose cheese and onion and the other chose prawn cocktail, they need to find out if either of those flavours would be palatable to both of them, or if they had to find a third flavour they both liked. </p> <p>Having agreed on the flavour, they need to join another pair of pupils and agree on a taste that would be acceptable to all four of them. Continue until the class is split into just two groups. Finally, see if the group can agree on one final flavour.</p> <h2>Here\u2019s the answer \u2013 what\u2019s the question?</h2> <p>Spread large sheets of paper around the room. On each sheet is an answer. The students need to come up with a question that would make the answer true for them personally.</p> <p>For example, the paper might say: \u201cNo, I hate them.\u201d The question for one student might be: \u201cDo you like brussel sprouts?\u201d For another, it might be: \u201cDo you enjoy maths lessons?\u201d Encourage them not to duplicate questions.</p> <p>Answers you might like to use include: \u201cEvery now and then\u201d, \u201cAt the weekends\u201d, \u201cIt always makes me laugh\u201d and \u201cYes, I have three\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/teacher-network/teacher-blog/2014/sep/04/tips-new-school-class-getting-to-know-each-other\">How to help students in your new class get to know each other</a> </p> </aside>  <h2>Choose a secret best friend</h2> <p>Put the names of all of your students into a hat, and invite each one to pick a name (check they haven\u2019t got themselves).</p> <p>The person they\u2019ve selected has become their \u201csecret best friend\u201d and they need to do at least one kind thing for them this week without letting them know who did it. </p> <p>Give examples of the kind of things students could do: get another student to deliver a small gift to your \u201cfriend\u201d, have someone open the door for them and see them to their seat, have a drink delivered to the person at lunch time, make something for them.</p> <p>At the end of the week, ask students to share what happened \u2013 and see if they can guess who did a nice thing for them. </p> <p><em>Molly Potter is the author of <a href=\"http://www.bloomsbury.com/uk/100-ideas-for-secondary-teachers-tutor-time-9781472925022/\">100 Ideas for Secondary Tutor Time</a></em></p> <h2><strong>Follow us on Twitter via <a href=\"https://twitter.com/GuardianTeach\">@GuardianTeach</a>.

We fitted ourselves with earmuffs, and one of the men, who\u2019d built a number of the guns himself and kept a home arsenal of at least 60 firearms, carefully showed me and the boys the safety features of each gun: touch here, never here.

When bored teens go hunting with their cousins and neighbors, they stay out of trouble. Speaking as a member of a queer household, I can say that although anti-LGBT sentiment is less coded here than it is in more affluent circles, the community is ultimately more accepting of difference: if you have to spend your lives together, you find a way to work it out.

Addressing the audience at a recent conference in San Francisco on <a href=\"http://digitalkidssummit.com/\">digital technology for children</a>, she said Smarty is designed for kids aged between five and 12. It will answer their questions, remind them when homework assignments are due, wake them in the morning, control their bedroom lighting, and stream music and audio books. Parents can monitor the child\u2019s activity through a web-accessible dashboard. \u201cIt is something a child can use from the moment they wake up to the moment they go to bed,\u201d Sparks says.</p> <p>Annual smart-toy sales worldwide are expected to grow from about $2.8bn in 2015 to $11.3bn by 2020, according to UK-based analyst firms <a href=\"http://www.juniperresearch.com/press/press-releases/smart-toy-revenues-to-hit-$2-8bn-this-year\">Juniper Research</a>. Digital toys and internet-connected devices for children, such as Smarty, are a rapidly growing part of that, along with intelligent building blocks, smart racing cars and drones, robots that teach kids how to code, and even a smart rubber duck aimed at the very young.

He welcomes the crossover between toys and screens, saying that when the technology becomes less visible, play comes to the fore. \u201cWe can begin talking about the quality of play and child development and not just whether screens are good or bad,\u201d he says.</p> <p>But while physical toys certainly have appeal, swapping screens for connected toys doesn\u2019t necessarily mean better experiences for children. Stuart Brown, an expert on play and founder of the not-for-profit <a href=\"http://www.nifplay.org/\">National Institute for Play</a> based in Carmel Valley, California, says that kids need real, authentic play \u2013 activity done for no purpose other than its own sake and where the outcome is secondary to the experience. </p> <p>Pure play with a side effect of learning is key to creating balanced people in life, he argues. And authentic play experiences with technology are possible if the technology is designed properly, he says.</p> <p>Mark Schlichting is a children\u2019s design specialist, CEO of <a href=\"http://www.noodleworks.com/\">NoodleWorks Interactive</a> and author of the forthcoming book Understanding Kids, Play and Interactive Design: How to Create Games Children Love. The hit screen-based games Minecraft and Pok\u00e9mon Go show that technology can enable pure play, he argues, engaging kids using classic, hard-wired \u201cplay patterns\u201d. Minecraft appeals to the builder-creator instinct, while Pok\u00e9mon Go appeals to children\u2019s collector spirit \u2013 and both involve social play. These play patterns help to keep children engaged beyond the initial novelty of a device or game. But Schlichting warns that most connected toys aren\u2019t there yet, and that \u201cwe are only at the beginning\u201d of designing them for authentic play.</p> <p>Schlichting reminds parents of the importance of choosing age-appropriate toys that match the age and stage of children (too hard is frustrating, too easy is boring) and put them in control; he says young minds open up when empowered.

She explains how if a child is given a stuffed animal he or she can use their imagination to talk to it, give it a name and use a voice for it. If the toy already comes with a voice and personality there is less room for a child to be creative and make up the story themselves. \u201cIt takes away the child\u2019s contribution,\u201d Singer says.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/aug/24/teens-online-cellphones-cyberbullying-parents\">US parents largely unaware of what their children do online, research finds</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Both Schlichting and Brown would like to see parents less concentrated on making their kids digital diets too full of overtly educational content.

Secondly to those who have indicated that I am devastated, I am very well thank you. This crafted conversation isn&#39;t distressing.

  "<p>I distinctly remember the first time I ate steak. I had just moved to a sixth-form in a posh area and a new schoolmate had offered me the pink, Waitrose-bought meat in between two slices of bread. Having been more used to processed-meat fillings, I was shocked to learn that people actually put something as luxe as a steak in a sandwich. Learning how the other half ate was one of many lessons I picked up from attending school with people who were wealthier than any I\u2019d previously come across.</p> <p>It\u2019s a silly example, but it was one of many social benefits of going to a socially mixed school.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/sep/13/grammar-schools-gamble-young-peoples-futures-social-mobility-london\">Grammar schools are yet another gamble with the futures of young people | Lewis Iwu</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Which is why I find Theresa May\u2019s plans to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/sep/09/theresa-may-to-end-ban-on-new-grammar-schools\" title=\"\">bring back grammar schools</a> so alarming. Repeating the myth that grammar schools increase social mobility, the prime minister insisted last week that new grammars would improve life chances for 1.25 million children in schools that were failing or in need of improvement. At best this policy is nostalgia for a time when things were very different; at worst it is a <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-37311018\" title=\"\">frank disregard for the evidence</a>. Only <a href=\"http://www.suttontrust.com/researcharchive/poor-grammar-entry-grammar-schools-disadvantaged-pupils-england\" title=\"\">3% of students</a> at grammar schools are entitled to free school meals \u2013 compared to 18% in a normal state comprehensive. Any new grammar schools will simply provide another mechanism alongside private schooling to further segregate students depending on how much money their parents have.</p> <p>This segregation is not beneficial for pupils. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/apr/19/increasing-social-mix-schools-improve-performance\" title=\"\">consistently pointed out</a> that increasing the social mix in schools improves the attainment of more disadvantaged students, without affecting the performance of their more wealthy counterparts. I can attest to this. Before I went to my posh (comprehensive) sixth-form in north London\u2019s Hampstead, I\u2019d only picked up a newspaper to scan the lonely hearts columns for my future husband. But being at school with middle-class mates whose arguments were backed up by opinion pieces in broadsheets, I adapted to keep up. And here I am writing one.</p> <p>But the idea that middle-class kids might actually have something to learn from their working-class mates is rarely mentioned. And this belief that social mixing is of no benefit to the better off could be key to the fact that May and her supporters are less than keen on encouraging it.</p> <p>I would like to think that my schoolmates learned a thing or two from me and the other people at our school who weren\u2019t middle-class. Rewind to a politics class where we debated the notion of a welfare state so thin it would only protect against starvation and destitution. Housed in temporary accommodation at the time and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/jan/19/cambridge-benefits-cut-welfare-under-25s-education\" title=\"\">living on benefits</a>, I was a passionate advocate on their behalf. Our classroom hosted a fierce debate with contributions from both those who had and hadn\u2019t benefited from the welfare state. It provided an invaluable intersection between theory and reality in the shape of an angry sixth-former with a point to prove.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/sep/12/theresa-may-grammar-schools-maidenhead\">Dear Theresa May, here\u2019s what grammar schools did to my family | John O\u2019Farrell</a> </p> </aside>  <p>At university, years later, we would debate evidence that kids who played instruments and went to museums tended to have higher IQs. It was in these areas that my middle-class peers often fell down. They couldn\u2019t view information like that outside of their own narrow experiences. These people genuinely thought their success was because their parents were smart and had made good choices. Being around students who hadn\u2019t been as lucky as they had introduced the notion that sometimes correlation does not equal causation.</p> <p>This seemed common sense to me, having grown up around tons of bright kids who were often held back academically by other factors. At university I met many of the opposite: those who should have been flung off the ladder early on, but who were aided by private tuition and schooling that allowed them to keep climbing it.</p> <p>I also remember informing a friend that teaching at a state school doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re that likely to get stabbed. He had aspirations to run the country one day, and, having gone to Cambridge, he may well do. I am glad that by going to university with me he has had the opportunity to socialise with those he someday wishes to represent.</p> <p>Whatever your background, school can provide a vital lesson in learning about those not like you, and becoming a more rounded person. If the government wants to reintroduce an education system that benefits wealthier children academically, it\u2019s worth remembering that it is not just the poor who are losing out.</p>",

  "<p>No one cares about the gifts. So what that the Astros gave David Ortiz a cowboy hat and the Royals some barbecue sauce and the Twins some peanut butter and the Mariners 34lbs of salmon. Ortiz shouldn\u2019t not come back because he\u2019s worried the Padres will be upset they bought him a surfboard as a retirement gift and then he didn\u2019t retire. They probably still have the receipt. </p> <p>\u201cI thought a lot about it,\u201d Ortiz said in November 2015, announcing this would be his final season after back-to-back last place finishes. \u201cEvery single one of us, athletes-wise, we run out of time at some point. Life is based on different chapters and I think I\u2019m ready to experience the next one in my life.\u201d Ortiz said all that on his 40th birthday, undoubtedly assuming that his skills would begin to noticeably erode in his age 40 season. </p> <p>But they haven\u2019t. In fact, Ortiz is having a career year and the best season in baseball history for a 40-year old. Name the stat \u2013 batting average, OBP, OPS, home runs, RBI \u2013 and it\u2019s well above Ortiz\u2019s career average. Meanwhile, the Red Sox have the second-best record in the American League and are a lock for the postseason. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/sep/21/house-of-david-baseball-religious-sect\">The religious sect that became baseball's answer to the Harlem Globetrotters</a> </p> </aside>  <p>There are zero reasons for Ortiz to retire after this season. Or at least zero good reasons. The farewell tour was a bad idea from the start, as Ortiz admitted himself back in June. If he ultimately decides to return for 2017, maybe his change of heart will put an end to these forced gift-giving tours for good. That alone would deserve a Hall of Fame nod.</p> <p>That leaves the notion that Ortiz should retire so he can \u201cgo out on top.\u201d Blecch. Going out on top is overrated. Sandy Koufax was forced to end his career because of arthritis after going 27-9 with a 1.73 ERA in 1966. Jim Brown and Barry Sanders cut their careers short in football while still among the best in their sports. Every discussion of the careers of Koufax, Brown and Sanders is hit with questions of \u201cWhat if?\u201d What if they had kept playing? What else could they have done? What records could they have broken? No one says: \u201cWasn\u2019t it awesome how we didn\u2019t get to watch them play as long as we could have?\u201d </p> <p>Ortiz was supposedly done in 2009 after back-to-back subpar seasons. Now, seven years later, he\u2019ll get MVP votes. If he\u2019s hitting like this at 40, why can\u2019t he do it at 41 or 42 or 45? It\u2019s not like the role he has on the Red Sox is a physically taxing one. He stands up to hit four times a game and occasionally has to run full-speed on a double. In between it\u2019s massages and hot tubs and first class flights and five-star hotels. He doesn\u2019t have to endure pounding on his knees like a position player, or on his arm like a pitcher, or on his brain like a football player. If 40 is the new 30 for everyone else, it\u2019s 25 for career-long designated hitters. So what\u2019s the point of retiring? DH and pro golfer are the only two jobs in sports where playing at the highest level is not too far off from being retired. </p> <p>Keep the surfboard and cowboy hat and 34lbs of salmon, Big Papi. Or give them back. It doesn\u2019t matter. Just please come back. No one will be upset. Well, no one except the Yankees, Rays, Blue Jays and Orioles. </p> <h2>Video of the week</h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENkKJG4e06o\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ENkKJG4e06o?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>Giancarlo Stanton has been a bit of a disappointment since signing his 13-year, $325m contract two years ago. Repeated injuries have kept him from reproducing the kind of numbers he put up in 2014 that spurred the deal. But if the Marlins ever regret paying him all that money \u2013 and team owner Jeffrey Loria most definitely regrets every dollar he has ever paid to someone other than Jeffrey Loria \u2013 they can pass a hat at every stadium they visit to help cover the cost. Fans will happily pay, because when Stanton is healthy and connects, there\u2019s no one else with his power in baseball right now and maybe ever. (Or at least not until Tim Tebow arrived in the sport, right?)<br><br></p> <h2>Quote of the week</h2> <p><br>\u201cPeople say to me: \u2018What are you going to do [in retirement]? What are you going to do?\u2019 And I say the same thing. You know if, you retire at the age of 65, the chances are you\u2019re going to have 20 more years. And so \u2018what are you going to do\u2019 is important to fill 20 years. When you retire at 89, the only answer to \u2018What are you going to do?\u2019 is \u2018Try to live.\u2019\u201d - <em>Vin Scully</em><br><br><br>Feel free to take a few minutes away from the rest of the column to sob uncontrollably and then pick up from here. <br><br></p> <h2>Who\u2019s closer to victory: Donald Trump or the Cubs? </h2> <p><br>It has been argued in this space before that Donald Trump has a much easier path to victory because he only has to beat one opponent, while the Cubs will have to through three rounds to win it all. And that\u2019s true. But in the divisional round, the Cubs will get to play the winner of the National League wildcard game. Have you seen the teams currently fighting for the wildcard spots? They are a true <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2016/09/09/politics/hillary-clinton-donald-trump-basket-of-deplorables/\">basket of deplorables</a>. Advantage: Cubs. <br><br></p> <h2>How did the kids piss off Goose Gossage this week? </h2> <p><br>While many of today\u2019s whippersnappers undoubtedly enrage the man named Goose with their carefree approach to life, he can find solace in the knowledge that prominent players like Madison Bumgarner still want to enforce the olds ways. After retiring Yasiel Puig of the rival Dodgers on Monday night, Bumgarner said \u201cDon\u2019t look at me!\u201d to the outfielder as he walked off the field. Then, per the unwritten rules of baseball, Bumgarner strategically positioned himself behind a team-mate and proceeded to pretend he was being held back from <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-5BRNhkKaY\">giving Puig the whooping he so deserved</a>. This is a man who can shoot and field dress a coyote, but can\u2019t handle another man looking at him? That makes no sense at all. Which means it makes perfect sense for baseball\u2019s code. </p> <h2>Nine things in order</h2> <p><br>1) Some in baseball remain very bitter that Tebow is <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jp_crawford/status/778363473860317184\">getting a look from the Mets</a>. \u201cHe\u2019s taking a spot from a deserving player,\u201d the argument usually goes. It\u2019s a bad argument and one that really doesn\u2019t deserve to be addressed, but let\u2019s do it anyway. Yes, it\u2019s true Tebow is taking someone else\u2019s spot, but he\u2019s taking the spot of the absolute worst player at the lowest-level of the organization. If Tebow didn\u2019t take it, that person was going to lose his spot tomorrow due to his lack of skill and the arrival of absolutely anyone else who might not be as bad. The Mets aren\u2019t cutting the next David Wright for an old quarterback. <br><br>2) There is zero downside for baseball with Tebow. The best-case scenario is that Tebow earns a ton of media attention for the game while failing out of the minors, thereby reminding everyone that hitting is an incredibly difficult skill a select few humans can master. The other option is that Tebow proves to be a capable player, makes it to the majors and ... generates exponentially more publicity for the sport. There is no worst-case scenario. To borrow a Tebowian phrase, baseball is \u201cblessed.\u201d <br><br>3) While the rest of the United States votes on whether to become an international joke on 8 November, the residents of Arlington, Texas, will also be determining if they want to build a new, retractable roof stadium for the Rangers to replace the 22-year old Globe Life Park. Commissioner Rob Manfred appeared in town this week to push for the new stadium, saying the current one puts the Rangers at a \u201ccompetitive disadvantage\u201d and the heat in an open-air stadium in Texas \u201cmakes it harder getting players to play there.\u201d That is some Trump-level bullshit from the commissioner. </p> <p>As for being \u201ccompetitive,\u201d the Rangers are set to win the AL West and make the playoffs for fifth time in seven years. They also made the playoffs three times in the first six years the stadium opened. And if it\u2019s hard for the Rangers to get players to play in the Texas heat, why did Prince Fielder waive his no-trade clause to get there from frigid Detroit? Why did Cole Hamels do the same to come from Philadelphia? Or Carlos Beltran from New York? Why did Yu Darvish sign there? Why did Adrian Beltre sign a six-year contract to leave Boston and play there? Is the Texas heat appreciably worse for someone who grew up in the Dominican Republic? The Rangers have the eighth-highest payroll in baseball, so perhaps players are OK with the heat. Or maybe they\u2019ve decided they can handle a bit of sweating in exchange for zero state taxes. Either way, the Rangers \u201ccompetitive disadvantage\u201d hasn\u2019t prevented the organization from being valued at $1.225bn by Forbes, <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/mlb-valuations/list/#tab:overall\">11th highest in all of baseball</a>.</p> <p>But, yes, let\u2019s get the Rangers a new stadium. One with a retractable roof. One to rival Jerry Jones\u2019 monstrosity. By the way, that Cowboys stadium has been open for more than seven years now, right? And Dallas haven\u2019t won anything. The Cowboys are at an obvious competitive disadvantage. Time to replace it.<br><br>4) Cubs second baseman Ben Zobrist rode his bike to Wrigley Field on Saturday in full uniform save for a pair of PF Flyers. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-instagram\"> <blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" data-instgrm-captioned data-instgrm-version=\"7\" style=\" background:#FFF; border:0; border-radius:3px; box-shadow:0 0 1px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.5),0 1px 10px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.15); margin: 1px; max-width:658px; padding:0; width:99.375%; width:-webkit-calc(100% - 2px); width:calc(100% - 2px);\"><div style=\"padding:8px;\"> <div style=\" background:#F8F8F8; line-height:0; margin-top:40px; padding:62.4305555556% 0; text-align:center; width:100%;\"> <div style=\" background:url(data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAACwAAAAsCAMAAAApWqozAAAABGdBTUEAALGPC/xhBQAAAAFzUkdCAK7OHOkAAAAMUExURczMzPf399fX1+bm5mzY9AMAAADiSURBVDjLvZXbEsMgCES5/P8/t9FuRVCRmU73JWlzosgSIIZURCjo/ad+EQJJB4Hv8BFt+IDpQoCx1wjOSBFhh2XssxEIYn3ulI/6MNReE07UIWJEv8UEOWDS88LY97kqyTliJKKtuYBbruAyVh5wOHiXmpi5we58Ek028czwyuQdLKPG1Bkb4NnM+VeAnfHqn1k4+GPT6uGQcvu2h2OVuIf/gWUFyy8OWEpdyZSa3aVCqpVoVvzZZ2VTnn2wU8qzVjDDetO90GSy9mVLqtgYSy231MxrY6I2gGqjrTY0L8fxCxfCBbhWrsYYAAAAAElFTkSuQmCC); display:block; height:44px; margin:0 auto -44px; position:relative; top:-22px; width:44px;\"></div></div> <p style=\" margin:8px 0 0 0; padding:0 4px;\"> <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BKdz1dTjGV9/\" style=\" color:#000; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; line-height:17px; text-decoration:none; word-wrap:break-word;\" target=\"_blank\">My man is an old soul who plays old school baseball.  @cubs</a></p> <p style=\" color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px; margin-bottom:0; margin-top:8px; overflow:hidden; padding:8px 0 7px; text-align:center; text-overflow:ellipsis; white-space:nowrap;\">A video posted by Julianna Zobrist (@juliannazobrist) on <time style=\" font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px;\" datetime=\"2016-09-17T17:41:06+00:00\">Sep 17, 2016 at 10:41am PDT</time></p></div></blockquote> <script async defer src=\"//platform.instagram.com/en_US/embeds.js\"></script> </figure>  <p>It\u2019s come to this.

Although I\u2019d still pick the Cubs in seven. <br><br>5) The red-hot Cardinals are now the favorites for the top NL wildcard spot.

(Disrespectful to Mets superstar Tim Tebow, in my opinion. How many jerseys are you selling, Syndergaard?)<br><br>While Derek Jeter was the last baseball player to appear on the cover in 2014, the Mets are really the team for the magazine. The Mets are identified with New York City and they are a joke that a lot of people don\u2019t get. The Mets are essentially a New Yorker cartoon brought to life.<br><br>8) No one saw San Francisco\u2019s collapse coming. After all, this is an even year so the World Series title was theirs, right? But even without that odd historical coincidence, the Giants had the most wins in the majors at the All-Star break. But in the second half of the season they\u2019re tied for the fewest wins in baseball and are in danger of failing to even grab a wildcard spot. The inability to score runs and the struggles of the bullpen are the obvious reasons for San Francisco\u2019s downfall, but there\u2019s something else out there that can be blamed by a sports columnist desperate enough for page-views. Yep, you guessed it: San Francisco has obviously been distracted by Colin Kaepernick. <br><br>9) It\u2019s not quite the 1998 home run chase as far as excitement goes, but the 2016 MLB season is on pace to set the all-time record for strikeouts. You can look at this as an accomplishment for pitchers or a failure by hitters or just the logical outcome of the destigmatization of the strikeout in Major League Baseball. Look at it any way you like. Just don\u2019t look at Madison Bumgarner. </p>",

For those who walk on the sunny side of the street, this was an assured film directed by Laverne &amp; Shirley\u2019s Penny Marshall which brought America up to speed on an untold sports story from the second world war. The travails of the Rockford Peaches, managed by Tom Hanks playing the role of weather-beaten former player Jimmy Dugan, manages to pack in storylines about shifting gender roles at the mid-point of the American century, feminist solidarity and the intensely violent Pacific campaign fought towards the end of the second world war.

The film swept the board at the 2005 Oscars and saw Hillary Swank win best actress for her role as down-and-out waitress Maggie Fitzgerald, who believes her last chance lies in the ring but weather-beaten throwback trainer Frankie Dunn (Clint Eastwood) \u201cdoesn\u2019t train girls\u201d. Except of course he does, otherwise this film wouldn\u2019t exist. Despite the film\u2019s flaws \u2013 Eastwood hogs much of the screen time, the other female boxers include a rather un-nuanced German ex-prostitute \u2013 Swank\u2019s portrayal is still one of the most compelling of any female athlete on the big or small screen. </p> <h2>Whip It</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c90ebed1ae1347e92bcbb425f440d3cd97e61e76\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c90ebed1ae1347e92bcbb425f440d3cd97e61e76/0_84_3120_1872/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Drew Barrymore, Ellen Page and Kristen Wiig in Whip It.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Drew Barrymore, Ellen Page and Kristen Wiig in Whip It.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sportsphoto Ltd./Allstar</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Unlike most other films in the subgenre, Whip It doesn\u2019t deal with a woman trying to thrive in a field typically dominated by men. In Drew Barrymore\u2019s energetic directorial debut, the sport of roller derby is filled with nothing <em>but </em>women, marking this out as something of a greased-up unicorn. The grungy world was one that ultimately proved a bit too niche for audiences (the film crashed with $16m worldwide) but critics agreed that it was fertile and untapped ground for an updated tale of against all odds achievement, as Ellen Page\u2019s spunky teen swapped her pageant crown for a pair of skates. Sexism was still on the agenda but rather than a bitter male contingent, it came from Marcia Gay Harden\u2019s small-town mother who wanted her daughter to embrace a more traditional concept of femininity.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <h2>Love &amp; Basketball</h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWwvDxo-O48\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/wWwvDxo-O48?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>A muted release back in 2000 might not have been the slam-dunk that producer Spike Lee had hoped for, but this romantic drama has developed a curiously large cult following ever since. It\u2019s easy to see why, given writer/director Gina Prince-Bythewood\u2019s unique and authentically realized story of a couple (Sanaa Lathan and Omar Epps) falling in and out of love while trying to reach their separate dreams of basketball stardom. Up until that point, women shooting hoops on the big screen was unheard of (it\u2019s been equally unexplored ever since) and it remains refreshing to see a sports movie playing out from a woman\u2019s point of view and especially one that refuses to indulge our more traditionalist view of the genre, focusing on the long game rather than the easy win.</p> <h2>Hang Time </h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cafaf5a38dfa2bbb6330a9d9fc0a64419c1c4f12\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cafaf5a38dfa2bbb6330a9d9fc0a64419c1c4f12/0_76_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The cast of Hang Time.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The cast of Hang Time.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: NBC/NBC via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Hang Time was not a particularly sophisticated show but in the barren wasteland of fictional female characters playing sports on the small screen, it stands out as an important one nonetheless. It was a Saturday morning comedy that ran on NBC from 1995 to 2000 and focused on Julie Connor (played by Daniella Deutscher), who moves to Deering high school in Indiana from Chicago. She wants to join the basketball team and of course the boys have a major problem with that \u2013 so their coach and real-life former NBA player (played by Reggie Theus) has to convince them all that Julie is talented enough to join. Because this was essentially a show for kids, she manages to make the team in the very first episode. It\u2019s a crude oversimplification of what would be an incredibly difficult process but it helped to show the captive young female audience that they could be something other than cheerleaders. Given that there are still so few examples of women as successful athletes on screen now, Hang Time deserves applause for attempting to change the game in 1995.</p> <h2>Bend it Like Beckham</h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dk5SrjFVQIM\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Dk5SrjFVQIM?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>Released during a period in British cinema when most comedies came with the word romantic attached, Gurinder Chadha\u2019s breakout hit played out on a very different field. While protagonist Jess (played by Parminder Nagra) does have a very dashing love interest (played by Jonathan Rhys Meyers), her biggest passion is soccer, against her traditional Indian family\u2019s wishes. It\u2019s notable that her camaraderie with fellow team-mate Jules (played by Keira Knightley) is also what shines brighter than her romance. They don\u2019t fall prey to a catty competitiveness that so often plagues women portrayed onscreen. They provide support and stability when outside characters are doing everything to break that. They are both actually good at soccer and integral to the team. Admittedly, there is a dramatic argument over a man but it\u2019s swiftly resolved and the ultimate satisfaction at watching two young women excel on the soccer field is worth the odd quibble.</p>",

  "<p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p><em>For some time now, I have been receiving from five to 20 unwanted \u201cadult\u201d emails per day. I followed Yahoo\u2019s advice on how to block these emails, but I still am receiving them. I contacted Yahoo again, but within the blink of an eye, I received a standard response email stating that my case was closed. I have also emailed the CEO of Yahoo UK, and I am angry with the complete indifference that Yahoo has shown.</em></p> <p><em>How can I stop these emails? I was thinking of sending them back to the sender, but I\u2019m wondering if it will have any impact.</em> <strong>Ruth</strong></p> <p>Adult emails are spam \u2013 and you can\u2019t stop spam. Anybody who has your home or office address can send you letters and anybody who has your email address can send you spam. You don\u2019t get much junk mail because it costs a lot to send. You will get lots of junk email because it costs nothing to send.</p> <p>Email service providers such as Yahoo, Google and Microsoft filter out billions of spam emails per day. Only a few get through, and five to 20 per day is not an unusual number.</p> <p>However, the ones that get through should arrive in your spam folder. If you are seeing obvious adult spam emails in your inbox then either the filtering is turned off \u2013 <a href=\"https://c-command.com/spamsieve/help/turning-off-the-yahoo-m\">which isn\u2019t easy to do in Yahoo Mail</a> \u2013 or the filters are failing.</p> <p>Unfortunately, spam filtering is a tricky business. If the filters are loose, you will see a few spam emails in your inbox. If the filters are too fierce, then legitimate emails will end up in your spam box.</p> <p>A few services offer better control. Plus.net, for example, lets you <a href=\"https://www.plus.net/help/email-guides/spam-protection-guide/\">select the aggressiveness of the spam filter</a> on a scale from 1 to 5. I haven\u2019t seen this option on free email services such as Google\u2019s Gmail, Microsoft\u2019s Outlook and Yahoo Mail.</p> <p>In my experience, Yahoo\u2019s filtering is a little loose, while Gmail is so fierce that it produces a lot of false positives. Which you prefer is a matter of taste, but if you want aggressive spam filtering, you could switch to Gmail. The drawback is that you may have to look in your spam folder every day or two or you could miss some important emails.</p> <p>Switching to an alternative free email service such as Gmail or Outlook has an obvious disadvantage: you will have to tell all your contacts to use a different email address. However, both Gmail and Outlook will collect all your old emails from Yahoo, so switching is not as difficult as it sounds.</p> <p>The main drawback with Gmail is the miserly amount of free storage space. I am using 98% of Gmail\u2019s 15GB but only 1.6% of Yahoo Mail\u2019s free 1TB (ie 16GB). Outlook free storage just expands as you use it.</p> <h2><strong>Spam filtering</strong></h2> <p>All email filters need some training, and it takes a while to build up a profile. This will be based, to some extent, on the emails you mark as spam. You should therefore keep reporting all the adult emails that reach your inbox.</p> <p>However, never open these emails to see what\u2019s in them. Spam emails may contain invisible \u201c<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_beacon\">web beacons</a>\u201d that tell the sender you have opened the email, so this is an active account. The result will be more spam. By contrast, the correct way to handle unwanted but legitimate emails \u2013 newsletters, marketing offers etc \u2013 is to open the email and click the \u201cunsubscribe\u201d or \u201cchange preferences\u201d link. Don\u2019t just put them in the spam folder.</p> <p>You can also set up your own filters to block emails from particular senders or about specific topics. In Yahoo\u2019s case, select an email in the inbox or spam folder then click on the down arrow next to the word \u201cmore\u201d. The drop-down menu should \u2013 but does not always \u2013 include the option to \u201cFilter emails like this ... \u201d Selecting this option pops up a dialog box with entries such as From, Subject and Body. You could, for example, filter out all emails that include words such as Viagra, Cialis and porn in the body of the email.</p> <p>Sadly, there\u2019s no point in trying to block specific email senders. Spammers use millions of From addresses, which are ridiculously easy to fake.</p> <h2><strong>Other matters</strong></h2> <p>You may be inadvertently opening spam emails. If your email system has a \u201cpreview pane\u201d, every email will be opened automatically when you select it or even scroll through it.</p> <p>To turn off Yahoo Mail\u2019s preview pane, click the cogwheel in the top right corner, and select Settings. When the page opens, select \u201cviewing email\u201d and look down the middle column for \u201cpreview pane\u201d. Set the option to \u201cnone\u201d.</p> <p>Note also that spam blocking doesn\u2019t actually delete spam emails. When the service filters spam emails, and when you report them as spam, they are moved to the Spam or Junk mail folder. If you check that for legitimate emails, you will see them there.</p> <p>If you go through the often-cumbersome process to auto-delete spam emails when they arrive, they\u2019ll be diverted to the bin or trash folder. You\u2019re unlikely to see them, but again, they\u2019re still there. They will only be deleted when you empty the trash folder, which your email service provider will do on a regular basis.</p> <p>Otherwise, don\u2019t bother trying to send spam emails back to their source, or retaliate against the sender. As mentioned, the From addresses may well be spoofed, and it would take some effort reading the headers to work out their actual source. And if the spammers have used a real person\u2019s email address, you\u2019ll just be adding to the burden inflicted on some hapless bystander.</p> <h2><strong>Support problems</strong></h2> <p>There\u2019s no point in getting upset about Yahoo\u2019s perceived lack of support. First, the company is trying to stop spam. If it\u2019s failing in one particular area, you can help by reporting the spam emails that get through. However, remember its spam filters have to work for hundreds of millions of people, not just for you.</p> <p>Second, Yahoo Mail is a free service, and it\u2019s uneconomic to provide human support to millions of people. This is also true for Google, Microsoft and other high-volume online service providers. The cost of an average \u201csupport incident\u201d probably starts at around \u00a325 for phone support and maybe \u00a310 for email support. The only viable option is online help pages that you have to figure out for yourself.</p> <p>If you want personal support, you should sign up for a paid service, such as <a href=\"https://www.fastmail.com/\">FastMail</a>. This starts at $3 per month or $30 per year with only 2GB or storage. The mainstream service provides 25GB of storage for $5 per month or $50 per year, and is cheap at that price.</p> <p>For other tips, see my earlier answer: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/askjack/2016/feb/18/how-can-i-stop-spam-emails\">How can I stop spam emails?</a></p> <p><strong>Have you got another question for Jack?

I\u2019m fed up with reading nagging articles about the risks of delaying pregnancy that fail to acknowledge structural factors shaping women\u2019s options. At the age of 26 I\u2019ve begun to think about starting a family. Though I don\u2019t want kids quite yet, in an ideal world I\u2019d hope to be ready within the next five or so years. Unfortunately, it\u2019s hard to know how realistic that is. I manage to scrape together just enough to meet my own living costs \u2013 something that\u2019s made significantly trickier by extortionate London housing costs. Being freelance also means I have no entitlement to maternity or sick pay. If I\u2019m not working, I\u2019m not earning.</p> <p>The worst thing is that my situation is still comparatively privileged. Though it\u2019s a challenge sometimes, at least I\u2019m managing to make rent. Low pay and a lack of job opportunities have forced many young people to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/aug/17/half-of-graduates-who-paid-9000-tuition-fees-live-with-parents\" title=\"\">move back in with their parents</a>, making them feel as though they\u2019re in a state of suspended adulthood. My income streams might be unreliable, but the hourly rate I earn for writing is higher than for many other jobs. For lots of people my age, things are significantly bleaker. Income insecurity isn\u2019t only a problem for the self-employed;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/16/zero-hours-banned-new-zealand-unite-union-mcdonalds-sports-direct-hermens-deliveroo\" title=\"\"> zero-hours contracts</a> are increasingly the norm in many industries. Almost a third of young people report that they\u2019ve been offered work on a zero-hours basis. Roughly the same number say they don\u2019t get the hours they need to cover their living costs. Even more shockingly, 22% say they\u2019ve been paid less than the legal minimum wage.

There\u2019s also a noticeable gender gap: 39% of young women say it\u2019s a struggle to make their money last until the end of the month, compared with 27% of young men.

Changes to the benefit system made by the Conservative government have made it even harder to bring up children alone. There\u2019s also an issue of income disparity. Though the overall gender pay gap is actually reversed for people in their 20s, with women earning slightly more than men, this effect doesn\u2019t hold across the class spectrum. Traditionally female-dominated roles such as childcare and beauty therapy are lower paid, on average, than disproportionately male fields such as plumbing and construction.</p> <p>It\u2019s frustrating to see older commentators go on about the alleged entitlement of feckless \u201cmillennials\u201d when the reality for many is poverty, desperation and crushing despair.

As people at the start of our careers, we\u2019re most vulnerable to the impact of automation. In the midst of a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/housing-matters/2016/sep/21/homelessness-cathy-come-home-private-rented\" title=\"\">housing crisis</a>, we\u2019re the ones least likely to own property, which leaves us vulnerable to the whims of private landlords. The fact that only about half of us are worried about our future prospects is a testament to the optimism of the human spirit.</p> <p>We\u2019re teetering on the brink of a full-blown crisis and urgently need solutions. Instead, our government seems to be going out of its way to make life even harder for young people.

Though young people have been disproportionately affected by recent changes, the dynamic of exploitation is nothing new. The trade union movement fought hard for employment rights that are being undermined by workforce casualisation. Unemployment and disability benefits exist as a safety net that any of us could find ourselves unexpectedly reliant on \u2013 save a privileged few with enough money in the bank that they never need worry. Though we might not realise it, welfare cuts harm us all.</p> <p>Young people aren\u2019t struggling as a result of unstoppable, all-powerful economic forces. It\u2019s true that new challenges have emerged, but ultimately our government is allowing this to happen. Wealth continues to grow more concentrated as wages stagnate and work becomes increasingly insecure. It\u2019s no coincidence that many Conservative party donors are wealthy business owners with an interest in keeping labour cheap and flexible. We need to recognise the situation for what it really is, and become a cogent political force capable of advocating for our own interests.

I am told South Australia is going to benefit. Western Australia has an election in March. Is this what is happening?\u201d</p> <p>Acting Victorian Labor education minister Jenny Mikakos likened comments by Birmingham to a burglar ringing ahead to ask someone to leave the door open.</p> <p>She said the Victorian education figures quoted by the minister related to education spending under the previous Liberal government. By tearing up the current school funding agreement Mikakos said Victorian schools would lose $1bn, which amounts to between $450,000 and $550,000 per school, per year.</p> <p>\u201cIt is like a prospective burglar calling ahead to ask people to leave the door open,\u201d Mikakos said.</p> <p>\u201cIt is an extraordinary way to to conduct commonwealth state relations.\u201d</p> <p>But the WA education minister Peter Collier defended the federal government\u2019s plans as \u201csensible and equitable\u201d which would provide a fairer distribution of funds for his state.</p> <p>\u201cThe original funding formula was fatally flawed,\u201d Collier said. </p> <p>\u201cWhy should a student from an identical background in Western Australia be funded at a much lower rate than a student that happens to live on the east coast of Australia? This is no way to operate an effective federation.</p> <p> \u201cI look forward to seeing a true needs-based funding model, similar to the Student Centred Funding Model we have already introduced in WA, that is working so well.\u201d</p> <p>Birmingham says the commonwealth is spending $73.6bn over four years (which equates to $3.9bn less than Labor promised). Before the election Birmingham also offered <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/may/01/coalition-announces-12bn-for-schools-but-labor-says-funding-inadequate\">$1.2bn of extra funding tied</a> to teacher training and year one testing. </p> <p>\u201cStates and territories will always be free under our constitution to fund schools in their state or territory as they see fit,\u201d Birmingham said.</p> <p>\u201cBut as a federal minister running a federal funding model, I want to make sure the bits that we\u2019re responsible for treat a student who might have a disability or might be from a low socioeconomic background the same, wherever they live in Australia.\u201d</p> <p>Honorary associate professor at Sydney University and education expert Jim McMorrow said, in theory, the commonwealth could press ahead with a school funding deal without the agreement of the states and territories.</p> <p>The current school funding agreements \u2013 contained in the Australian Education Act \u2013 finish by December 2017. Any new legislation needs to pass through both houses of parliament. </p> <p>\u201cIt is up to the commonwealth to amend legislation and the commonwealth can determine to do what it wants,\u201d McMorrow said. \u201cBut for most of the last two decades, the conditions included national agreement.</p> <p>\u201cThe Hawke government started the national agreement idea and it was carried on by John Howard, but in principle the commonwealth can decide any conditions that it wants.\u201d</p> <p>Education ministers meet in Adelaide on Thursday evening and Friday morning to begin to thrash out the agreements for 2018-19. Those years represent the final two years of the six-year so-called Gonski funding agreements. </p> <p>At issue is the funding formula and whether to extend formulas based on the Gonski recommendations of baseline funding for individual students, loaded for any disadvantage.</p> <p>The Gonski funding plan was considered Julia Gillard\u2019s signature policy but of the current agreements, half of the states were signed up by the Gillard government prior to the 2013 election and half by the incoming Abbott government.</p> <p>Birmingham has argued that far from delivering a baseline national schooling resource standard (SRS) with loading for disadvantages, the current state and territory agreements provide different amounts for equivalent students in different states. He argues this is a corruption of the Gonski ideals.</p> <p>While Birmingham has talked about the importance of funding based on students\u2019 needs, the Coalition has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/aug/03/naplan-results-writing-reading-numeracy-scores-plateaued-gonski-funding-link\">consistently</a> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/apr/07/experts-say-malcolm-turnbull-using-flimsy-evidence-on-school-funding\">distanced itself</a> from the Gonski model. </p> <p>Queensland\u2019s acting Labor premier and education minister, Curtis Pitt, said Birmingham was turning his back on education in Queensland and trying to lecture the states when \u201cthey don\u2019t run a single school\u201d.<br></p> <p>\u201cWe educate more than 380,000 students in regional and rural areas with more than 1,000 schools outside the Brisbane metropolitan area,\u201d Pitt said.</p> <p>\u201cWe also educate around one third of the nation\u2019s Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander students and some of these students live in the most remote areas of the country.</p> <p>\u201cQueensland is also a growth state and we need funding to keep pace with our growing population.\u201d</p> <p>Australian Education Union federal president Correna Haythorpe said the federal government\u2019s refusal to honour years five and six of the Gonski agreements with the states would see schools lose $3.9bn in funding.</p> <p>\u201cNo state has yet reached the minimum resourcing standards for schools that were outlined in the Gonski report,\u201d Haythorpe said.</p> <p>\u201cThat is because under the Gonski agreements, two-thirds of the extra funding to schools was to be delivered in 2018 and 2019. We don\u2019t need to reinvent Gonski, we need to fund it in full.\u201d<br></p>",

  "<h2>\u2018The learning never stops\u2019</h2> <p>My first job after qualifying in 2013 was as a social worker in a frontline child and family team. It sounds cliche but I wanted to make a difference to people\u2019s lives, to engage in meaningful work that would make a difference whether big or small. I wish I had known just how quickly time goes when you are so busy all the time and just how emotionally affected I would so often be by some of the people and the situations. Emotional support to manage this is vital if you are to stay healthy and well. On a more professional level, I wish I had known just how much more there was to learn beyond the social work degree and my previous experience \u2013 that I would continue to learn something new every day, about myself, about practice, theory, policy, people in general. The learning really never stops.</p> <p><em>Marie Addy, senior social worker and acting assistant team manager, Norfolk</em></p> <h2>\u2018Stay calm and keep being kind\u2019</h2> <p>I didn\u2019t quite realise before I started just how profoundly important the work we do is. Things we do that we think are small can have such a big impact on people\u2019s lives. We obviously have to do lots of recording and I\u2019d wish I\u2019d known sooner how important it is that you think about what you write and how you write it, and the impact it can have. Not just because children and families will read it but also that you don\u2019t leave room for misinterpretation. You become part of the story of people\u2019s lives and the narrative you create about families is extremely powerful, so you don\u2019t want it to be misinterpreted or misused later on. You have to own your responsibility as a social worker. It feels frightening to take responsibility for what you do, but it\u2019s also empowering because it makes you accept who you are and the impact and power you have. It\u2019s also important to remain calm and keep being kind and warm, even when things are really difficult in a family\u2019s life. </p> <p><em>Isabelle Trowler, chief social worker for children and families</em></p> <h2>\u2018Learn how to cope with corporate change\u2019</h2> <p>I started working for a local authority as an unqualified social worker in 1996 and have been qualified since 2008. If I could go back and give myself advice it would be to always work for the people in the community and keep them at the heart of your practice, in spite of all the politics and office or managerial changes. I would also say (which I do say now to students) that social workers need to be able to cope with corporate change and not be put off by the constant changes to team structure and higher management. I had been naive about how much these changes would impact my work, but if you always stay faithful to your social work ethics and strive for the best for the people you serve, then you will ride the changes much easier than rejecting them and fighting to remain the same. The experiences in my early career are the ones that helped to ground me and have the confidence to cope with the ever-changing world of social care. </p> <p><em>Amanda Moore*, adult social worker and team manager, West Midlands </em></p> <h2><em>\u2018</em>I wish I had known the importance of getting constant feedback\u2019</h2> <p>My first role as a qualified practitioner was as a hospital social worker in a large inner-city teaching hospital when I was 22. Much of it involved palliative and end-of-life care. I still remember many of the people I worked with and what I learned in practice about human nature, development and the strengths and resilience of people in managing the challenging circumstances in which they found themselves. I wish I had known the importance of getting constant feedback on my practice and skills from people with whom I worked, both service users and carers as well as other professionals, to improve the effectiveness of my social work practice. My best learning was from co-working with other colleagues and the reflective time we spent with people talking about what was helpful and made a difference. My advice to any new social workers is to hang out with good, inspiring practitioners and take every opportunity to develop and deepen skills and practice knowledge across a range of areas. This benefits your work with service users and, as you progress, as a supervisor supporting the work of other social workers and related professional colleagues. </p> <p><em>Lyn Romeo, chief social worker for adults</em></p> <h2>\u2018The person you are working with is the expert of their life\u2019</h2> <p>My first job in social care was in a nursing home for older people. I was out of work and called up asking about jobs in the kitchens. I knew within the first morning of the first day that I would work in social care for the rest of my career. Having qualified as a social worker, my first role was in a very busy hospital and it felt like a crash course in social work. The rapidity necessary to ensure discharge, while upholding rights and ensuring people were listened to and were able to make choices, was intense. I wish I had known when I started that in adult social work the person that you are working with is the expert of their life, their condition, their situation. As such they are the decision-maker and if they are unable to make decisions, there is legislation to adhere to. Find allies, other social workers who share your values \u2013 and don\u2019t expect that just because your colleagues are social workers that they necessarily think the same as you. And enable risk where you can. As a judge once said: \u201cWhat\u2019s the point of making someone safe if it merely makes them miserable?\u201d</p> <p><em>Rob Mitchell, principal social worker, West Yorkshire</em></p> <h2>\u2018Asking for help is not a sign of weakness\u2019</h2> <p>My first job after graduating in 1987 was with Somerset county council as a social worker in a generic team, although mainly I worked with adults and children with learning disabilities and their families. I wish I had known that I should be patient with myself and that asking for help is not a sign of weakness. And the importance of taking time to reflect. Reflection is an essential skill in social work, vital in processing what you are seeing and hearing and also in how you are feeling. It enables you to do and notice what you are doing simultaneously.</p> <p><em>Kim Holmes, principal social worker, Wiltshire</em></p> <p>* Some names have been changed</p> <p><strong><a href=\"https://register.theguardian.com/social-care/\">Join the Social Care Network</a> to read more pieces like this.

As it is, he says, men are largely left out. Most family planning programmes target women and girls, and with good reason: globally, the biggest barrier to reducing birth rates is gender inequality \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.populationinstitute.org/external/files/reports/from-6b-to-7b.pdf\">population growth</a> is fastest where female literacy is low, violence against women is common and reproductive rights are not protected.</p> <p>Still, the reality remains that men tend to dominate decision making about family size and birth control. At the same time, they tend to be detached from or opposed to family planning, and the result is often that their partners discontinue using birth control or never start at all. In fact, of the unmarried women who say they don\u2019t want to get pregnant within the next two years, close to a quarter don\u2019t use contraception because someone close to them opposes it \u2013 one reason for the <a href=\"https://www.guttmacher.org/fact-sheet/adding-it-investing-sexual-and-reproductive-health\">74m million</a> unintended pregnancies that occur annually.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re now realising that while it\u2019s important to focus on women and girls, we can\u2019t continue with business as usual,\u201d says Kerrigan. \u201cWe have to positively disrupt the status quo.\u201d World Vasectomy Day, she says, is just that \u2013 an effort to secure men\u2019s engagement, using modern innovations that can accelerate progress.</p> <h2>No scalpels </h2> <p>One of those innovations is the no-scalpel vasectomy. First performed in China in the 1970s, the technique made what was already a safe, simple procedure \u2013 a pair of small incisions to sever the duct that delivers sperm from the testicles (the vas deferens) \u2013 even more so. Using the no-scalpel approach, a provider need only locate the vas deferens under the skin and make a single needle puncture through which to cut it, minimising the risk of bleeding.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Men equate vasectomy with castration, or believe it will cause them to be impotent</p> <footer> <cite>Ricky Lu</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cThat modification really facilitated the spread of vasectomy across the globe,\u201d says Carmela Cordero, a reproductive health expert with <a href=\"https://www.engenderhealth.org/index-main.php\">EngenderHealth</a>. \u201cBefore, it was only the urologist who could perform a vasectomy.

  "<p>Few foods remind me quite as strongly of childhood as the fish finger. Though I claimed not to like fish for an embarrassingly long time, these orange sticks, which tasted largely of salt and margarine, were far enough removed from anything with fins to meet my approval \u2013 which was fortunate given that, like most British schoolchildren at the time, we had them almost every Friday for a decade or so. Like the Jammy Dodger or orange squash, the fish finger, which<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/wordofmouth/2015/sep/15/fish-fingers-60-britain-taste-of-childhood\"> celebrated its diamond jubilee</a> last year, has become an infant institution. Generations of us have grown up at the<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lklk5TYBAAI\"> Captain\u2019s table</a>, and such is the strength of its nostalgic appeal that the fish finger sandwich is now a fixture on menus aimed at drunk adults, too.</p> <p>The frozen variety has certainly improved since the 80s, when they were grey and fluffy, and contained, if memory serves, no actual flakes of fish \u2013 or perhaps I just pay more for them than my school kitchen. But, handy as they are for last-minute meals, the homemade sort is a real treat. A robust piece of perfectly seasoned fillet, coated in a hot, crisp, savoury crumb is ample proof that fish fingers are not a taste you ever have to grow out of.<br></p> <h2>The fish</h2> <p>Though originally developed as a way to shift surplus herring, fish fingers have long been associated with meaty white fish such as cod, haddock or, in recent times, more populous alternatives such as pollack or whiting. Our growing obsession with salmon, which last year<a href=\"http://www.scotsman.com/lifestyle/salmon-leaps-ahead-of-tuna-as-uk-s-favourite-fish-1-3949377\"> overtook tuna for the first time as Britain\u2019s favourite fish</a>, does not seem to have dimmed our ardour for the classic white fish finger. Birds Eye has given up trying to flog a salmon alternative, and after trying the version in<a href=\"https://penguin.com.au/books/4-super-food-family-classics/recipes/596-jamies-jumbo-fish-fingers\"> Jamie Oliver\u2019s new book, Super Food Family Classics</a>, I think they made the right decision. My testers agree: biting into a salmon fish finger \u201cfeels weird\u201d, they say, and they don\u2019t like it: \u201ctoo strong\u201d, apparently. Fish finger fans are clearly a conservative bunch.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"31248bb013fcabc566b46654755d2213a313a3b8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/31248bb013fcabc566b46654755d2213a313a3b8/14_33_3549_2703/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Rick Stein\u2019s fish fingers\" width=\"1000\" height=\"762\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rick Stein\u2019s fish fingers.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Felicity Cloake/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><a href=\"http://www.food-mag.co.uk/goujons-of-lemon-sole-with-parmesan-breadcrumbs-recipe/\">Rick Stein</a> uses lemon sole for his goujons (it\u2019s unclear to me exactly where the line lies between these and homemade fish fingers, if indeed there is one, especially as he specifies they should be cut \u201cto about the size of your finger\u201d) but this delicate flat fish is even easier to overcook. Something more robustly sized is a better bet if you\u2019re not deep-frying like Stein (of which more later).</p> <p>All the other recipes I try use white fish of some description, with<a href=\"http://www.apple.com\"> Gordon Ramsay</a> suggesting pollack and<a href=\"https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=xbQ5CQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT145&amp;lpg=PT145&amp;dq=john+torode+fish+fingers&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=7KSPTT1bl3&amp;sig=A9QK7m2LpT6DpCh2xeKAok_D4Eg&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjs4c774YfPAhWJJMAKHXm5AAYQ6AEIPzAE#v=onepage&amp;q=john%20torode%20fish%20fingers&amp;f=false\"> John Torode\u2019s book My Kind of Food</a> recommending cod or haddock.

While I don\u2019t find any of the recipes I try especially floppy, I do think this improves the flavour no end, effectively seasoning it from the inside out. Torode directs the reader to turn the fillet \u201cso the sloping edges \u2026 are facing you head on\u201d in order to \u201ccut against the grain \u2013 if you don\u2019t, the fish will fall apart as it cooks\u201d. Wise advice indeed. </p> <h2>The coating</h2> <p>If you want authentic, then please, allow me to point you in the direction of<a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/food/recipes/homemade_fish_fingers_85938\"> the Hairy Biker\u2019s recipe</a>, which uses a tub of golden breadcrumbs I recognise from afternoons spent cleaning out my mum\u2019s cupboards for pocket money. Made from seasoned flour garishly coloured with turmeric and paprika extract, they provide that authentic orange glow, and, like Torode\u2019s fine breadcrumbs, form a solid casing around the fish that other, rougher-textured varieties such as Oliver, Stein and Vanessa Kimbell\u2019s fresh crumbs cannot replicate. This, it would seem to me, is an essential quality of the fish finger, as opposed to mere breaded fish; it should have a breadcrumb shell, rather than a haphazard coating, which demands a fine crumb.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bc26eb64d1cf2375fa389d9a574313b912d0e059\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bc26eb64d1cf2375fa389d9a574313b912d0e059/302_134_3335_2602/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Hairy Bikers\u2019 fish fingers\" width=\"1000\" height=\"780\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Hairy Bikers\u2019 fish fingers.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Felicity Cloake/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Torode uses polenta as well as breadcrumbs, which gives his coating a satisfying graininess, but nothing can compete with Ramsay\u2019s panko breadcrumbs when it comes to crunch. This Japanese variety is also made from wheat bread, but panko are, as he explains, \u201cflakier than other crumbs, and give fried food a lighter coating that stays crispy for longer\u201d.</p> <p>My problem is that, delicious as this is, mere crispness is not enough, and panko will never come together into the solid shell I\u2019m after. My solution is to grind half of them more finely, and then use these in combination with the larger flakes. If you prefer, you can replace the ground panko with another kind of fine, dry (cheaper!) breadcrumb. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"762e20f5a9ee3b635a527b266f18b2a5bd9f0ac3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/762e20f5a9ee3b635a527b266f18b2a5bd9f0ac3/85_0_3558_2595/1000.jpg\" alt=\"John Torode\u2019s fish fingers\" width=\"1000\" height=\"729\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">John Torode\u2019s fish fingers.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Felicity Cloake/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Seasoning</h2> <p>My instinct is to keep the crumb pretty plain out of loyalty to the original version; I\u2019m pretty sure Captain Birdseye would have a few things to say about Oliver\u2019s smoked paprika, or Ramsay\u2019s dill. That said, he\u2019s a fictional sea captain, not a chef, and although I\u2019m not a big fan of the cheese-and-fish combination some recipes employ (cheddar for Oliver; parmesan for Stein), most of the other seasonings work very nicely. Kimball\u2019s garlic, lemon zest and tarragon sourdough crumbs, from her book <a href=\"http://www.sourdough.co.uk/food-for-thought/\">Food for Thought</a>, are good enough to eat on their own, like Spanish migas, and Oliver\u2019s paprika and Stein\u2019s cayenne add a subtle touch of spice that feels oddly thrilling in such a homely context. Go mad with herbs and spices if you must, but don\u2019t come crying to me if your fish fingers don\u2019t taste right.</p> <h2><br></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cd78d7fc6160339da3c4bd2ecc1a58fc08d5a520\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cd78d7fc6160339da3c4bd2ecc1a58fc08d5a520/0_0_3648_2736/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Fish fingers by Jamie Oliver\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Fish fingers by Jamie Oliver.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Felicity Cloake/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Cooking</h2> <p>Those of my youth were invariably baked or grilled, but now I\u2019ve tried them fried, I don\u2019t think any amount of nostalgia could tempt me back to the oven. Not only does frying the fish fingers give them an unbeatably crisp, delicious coating, but it\u2019s faster, which means the fish inside doesn\u2019t dry out during cooking. As we\u2019re going for fish fingers, rather than Stein\u2019s fancy goujons, there\u2019s no need to incur<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/aug/27/gregg-wallace-deems-mary-berry-fryer-comments-attack-on-british-way-of-life\"> Mary Berry\u2019s wrath with deep-frying</a>, or even for Torode\u2019s shallow-fried alternative, when Ramsay\u2019s pan-fried recipe, in a pan barely coated with oil, works so well.</p> <p>Like Stein, he suggests sunflower oil, which I like for its neutral flavour. Kimbell goes for rapeseed and Oliver olive oil, both of which work well if you prefer the taste, but I\u2019ve fallen for Ramsay\u2019s idea of finishing the fish fingers with a modest knob of butter to replicate and improve on that faint margarine flavour I remember from childhood. If you\u2019re concerned about your fat intake, leave it off your peas instead; I promise you won\u2019t regret it. (And yes, fish fingers must always be eaten with peas, if not between two squishy slices of white bread.

Tait has been on a lifetime high-rate award of DLA for mobility since she was a teenager but had to go through a medical for PIP this year. She had her benefit bumped down to the standard rate and was subsequently told she <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/apr/06/paralympics-carly-tait-lifeline-car-disability-benefit-cuts\">would lose her specialist car</a>.

There are no exemptions or \u201cgood sense\u201d limits to this. The re-testing of PIP claims means, in practice, blind people, paraplegics and those with Down\u2019s syndrome will be put through reassessment: forced to provide information about their disability that the government already has and cannot possibly have changed.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jun/07/pip-disaster-disabled-access-report-benefits\">PIP is a disaster for disabled people.

They are a sensible and humane response to the reality that some people\u2019s disabilities will never get better: allowing a person to go through the difficulty of a benefit assessment only once. There is something deeply shaming about having to prove to the state you are still as disabled as you used to be, in having to convince a stranger \u2013 hired by the government \u2013 that you still deserve support for the chronic illness, mental health problem or disability that will be part of you for life.</p> <p>In a climate of fear and suspicion around so-called welfare, the government is choosing to put its disabled citizens through this ordeal because it fits the narrative it helped to create. This is what it\u2019s come to: orchestrating widespread benefit testing that feeds the myth of disabled people as scroungers, out to milk the system.</p>",
  "<h2>Today\u2019s best bets, by Chris Cook </h2> <p>Forgive me, Flat purists, for beginning with faraway Perth (faraway if you live in England, anyway) when there\u2019s quality action on the Rowley Mile. But there\u2019s an unexpectedly good novice hurdle in prospect up there, with both Moon Racer and Ballyandy making their debuts over timber. </p> <p>These are the two most recent winners of the Cheltenham Festival Bumper. I would think this must be the first time consecutive winners of that race have made their hurdles debut in the same race (Moon Racer having missed nearly all of last season with injury), though I shall leave it to even geekier types to actually check that. <br></p> <p>Moon Racer has the better bumper form, which explains why the market gives him the edge. Being a perverse sort, however, I shall be opposing them both. It\u2019s always seemed to me that the correlation between flashy bumper horse and quality hurdler is a lot weaker than most punters imagine. </p> <p>Ballyandy has a full brother (Megastar) who won the Aintree bumper before compiling a 1/10 record over hurdles. Moon Racer\u2019s only sibling is 1/12 over hurdles (though he also failed to win a bumper, so it\u2019s not like they\u2019re the same animal). </p> <p>Predictably, the market has almost no interest in anything else in the race but <strong>Wakea (3.20)</strong> looks a live runner to me at 9-1. He was good enough to win off 95 on the Flat for Jeremy Noseda and ran fourth in the Sagaro last year before winning two of his three hurdles starts so far for Irish-based trainer Karl Thornton. </p> <p>He lost one of those wins to a positive test for an anti-inflammatory and still looked a work in progress when scoring at Clonmel a fortnight ago, though his jumping was improved on what he showed in May. \u201cHe was in no way wound-up and will come on a tonne for it,\u201d Thornton said. </p> <p>At Newmarket, Escobar looks a false favourite in the Tattersalls Stakes, for all that he was still green when landing the Washington Singer last time and will doubtless be straighter. I\u2019m not convinced the form of that race adds up to a great deal and there might be more potential in Aidan O\u2019Brien\u2019s <strong>Whitecliffsofdover (3.40)</strong> at 5-1. </p> <p>It\u2019s just over a year since this son of War Front fetched $1m at auction in Kentucky. He was given a gentle introduction in June in a race won by a more fancied stablemate, Intelligence Cross, a subsequent Group Three winner. Whitecliffsofdover might have been called the paddock pick that day according to the Post. </p> <p>He duly hosed up in a Naas maiden next time when stepped up to this distance. Again, the form is weak but he\u2019s on a strong upward curve. O\u2019Brien is on a 33% strike-rate with his juveniles in Britain this year. </p> <p>At 11-2, <strong>William Hunter (4.50)</strong> is the nap in the 12-furlong handicap, having really come to himself since midsummer. A strong-travelling sort, he may actually be helped by the step up in class and I think there\u2019s plenty more to come. He\u2019s only up 5lb for quite a convincing Ascot success and may be on his way to the November Handicap. <br></p> <p><em>We are no longer able to continue with competitions every week, but they will still run in the biggest weeks (Cheltenham, Aintree, Royal Ascot, Glorious Goodwood and maybe one or two others, as well as the Christmas quiz). <br></em></p> <p><em>We\u2019ll still have a Talking Horses each day for tips, analysis and news, so we very much hope you\u2019ll join us to chew over whatever racing happens to be going on and post your tips or racing-related comments below. </em><br></p>",

Then State Like Sleep, where he is a sleazy nightclub owner. Before that, he was the deranged documentary-maker Richard Wilder in the intoxicating <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/mar/20/high-rise-review-ben-wheatley-jg-ballard-tom-hiddleston\">High-Rise</a>, which really took its toll. </p> <p>\u201cA couple of times during shooting, I went out drinking but I was so into the character that the second I had some alcohol, this personality was present. I wasn\u2019t looking for fights or anything. I was just much larger than life than I would have been ordinarily as Luke.\u201d Thank heavens he managed to fit in some light relief in the forthcoming live-action <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/may/25/beauty-and-the-beast-teaser-trailer-record-emma-watson\">Beauty and the Beast</a> in which he stars alongside Emma Watson as Gaston.

Ordinarily I\u2019d have you in the corner with a bucket trying to catch it all.\u201d</p> <p>He enjoyed preparing the look of Wilder: the mutton chops, the Tom Selleck moustache. \u201cIt\u2019s the final layer. I\u2019ve always felt a part of me is still on show until those touches are in place. Then I can disappear.\u201d His hair now is short, black, shiny.

It\u2019s just that he spent a decade in musical theatre before his first film, so he never got the chance to watch himself. \u201cAll you\u2019d hear was other people\u2019s opinions. \u2018Oh, it was wonderful!\u2019 And I\u2019m thinking: \u2018Was it?

I was desperate to know whether the audience could see what I was feeling \u2013 whether psychologically it was coming through.\u201d</p> <p>I remark that his stage career predates theatre-to-cinema broadcasts and he laughs. \u201cTrust me, they wouldn\u2019t have shown anything I was in.\u201d He\u2019s talking about the West End barnstormers: Rent, Piaf, Miss Saigon. Then he corrects himself. \u201cHold on. They <em>did</em> film <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/stage/2002/may/23/theatre.artsfeatures\">Taboo</a> for DVD. Really badly.\u201d That 2002 musical, co-written by Boy George and based partly on the singer\u2019s life, was Evans\u2019s breakthrough. He was 22 when he played Billy, who flees his suburban home to become one of London\u2019s new romantics. Or, as Evans calls them in an endearing slip, \u201ctrue romantics\u201d.</p> <p>There were similarities between himself and the character. \u201cBilly from Bromley. Luke from Aberbargoed. We both came to the big city. And Billy has that song.\u201d He begins singing very softly, almost to himself: \u201cIf I stay here, I\u2019ll be nothing, I\u2019ll be no one, so don\u2019t stop me, it\u2019s safe in the city \u2026 \u201d He has, by his own admission, a tremendous voice. When he arrived at the London Studio Centre at the age of 17 on a scholarship, he couldn\u2019t keep up in tap class and he was always falling behind in technique but he could wipe the floor with his classmates when it came to singing. So the effect of him performing those lines in this tiny hotel room is rather like seeing an Olympic sprinter jogging on the spot. Even idling, he\u2019s impressive.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"13a3a62a1c55e6fa243989e47b13f632916c209b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/13a3a62a1c55e6fa243989e47b13f632916c209b/154_0_1783_1070/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Luke Evans with Haley Bennett in The Girl on the Train.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018It was a dark one\u2019 \u2026 Evans with Haley Bennett in The Girl on the Train.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/Dreamworks SKG</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Evans always knew he would leave Aberbargoed, a small town in Caerphilly. As a child, he was bullied intensely. His parents are Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses who would take him along with them to spread the word on their neighbours\u2019 doorsteps every weekend. \u201cImagine. You\u2019re knocking while they\u2019re watching He-Man on a Saturday morning. Who wants to be interrupted when they\u2019re watching He-Man? I don\u2019t blame my parents or their religion but I hated it. I absolutely hated it. There were streets I wouldn\u2019t walk down in case the bullies were there. I wouldn\u2019t play out in the evening with my friends. I\u2019d go half an hour out of my way to avoid those streets. Then I\u2019d have to stand on a bully\u2019s doorstep in a suit with my parents behind me on a Saturday morning.\u201d He winces. \u201cThat\u2019s not what you want to do as a kid.\u201d</p> <p>Is there an element of redress in the roles he plays now? \u201cIt\u2019s possible, yeah. If a bullied kid reads this article and sees that someone like me went on to play these quintessential, masculine characters \u2026 Well, maybe that shows you don\u2019t have to let it affect you. That bully is only one person you will meet out of thousands in your life.\u201d Evans <a href=\"http://time.com/3491050/luke-evans-dracula-untold-coming-out/\">coming out</a> as gay when he was 22 may have had much the same effect on anyone hiding their sexuality. \u201cI don\u2019t blast it from the rooftops because I\u2019m a very private person. And it doesn\u2019t affect anything. But it\u2019s life. This is who I am as Luke.\u201d That habit of referring to himself in the third person suggests a slight dislocation between person and actor. In fact, he admits that he only truly feels like himself when he is with his family back in Wales. \u201cI mean, I can put it on. For a day, a week, an event, a dinner.

He believes the Bank learned lessons from the global financial crisis.</p> <p>\u201cThe collapse in business and consumer confidence data from April 2008 was the earliest signal that the Great Recession had started. So it was sensible for the MPC to act when they collapsed after the Brexit vote and not to wait, as some have suggested, for the \u2018hard data\u2019,\u201d said Blanchflower, a professor of economics at Dartmouth College, New Hampshire. \u201cMy worry is that there is a lot of bad news to come.

  "<p>\u201cThere is something actually, doctor.\u201d</p> <p>I turned around in relief.</p> <p>Anxiously twirling my pen, the piece of armoury I still felt most comfortable with as a junior doctor, I hurried back to her bedside, drug chart poised.</p> <p>Annette was an 82-year-old lady with lung cancer. It was my first month at the hospice. We\u2019d been trying everything to ease her breathlessness. From medications to mindfulness, chest physiotherapy to visits from the chaplain ... nothing helped. And now a lump formed in my throat every morning, as I tentatively roused the frail outline curled into a ball, each day bearing a starker resemblance to a child. Her words were interspersed with a soft, gasping rattle, as I\u2019d ask the same question: \u201cWhat can I do for you Annette?\u201d</p> <p>I don\u2019t remember learning much about end-of-life care at medical school. Or perhaps I didn\u2019t pay much attention. After all, I went into this job to keep my patients alive. Thinking about death wasn\u2019t a subject that resonated with the newly qualified me, raring to go into action, scenes of bloody heroics reflected in my eyes as I was unleashed onto the wards.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/oct/11/lets-talk-about-death-what-does-it-mean-to-you\">Let's talk about death: what does it mean to you?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>I spent six years being trained how to deploy our ever-expanding arsenal of technology. My satisfaction, and my identity as a doctor, came from a feeling of competence. Just as a sculptor feeds his passion by constructing new statues or a carpenter by chipping away at fragile antiques to restore them to their beauty, so I fed my sense of worth by fixing what was in my control.</p> <p>I had just about grasped the choreography of medicine: people agree to become our patients and we agree to try and fix them until the very end, as all manner of machinery trill and beep around their frail figures. </p> <p>But Annette was not being fixed. And I was running out of tools.</p> <p>\u201cDo you know what I\u2019d really like, doc? Some KFC.\u201d</p> <p>As I sat with her later, watching her surprisingly nimble arthritic fingers tear apart a bucket of chicken wings, I couldn\u2019t shake the feeling that we\u2019d surrendered. I knew our battle with death can never be won, but I had a niggling unease that we were retreating prematurely. </p> <p>It soon became a ritual. Every few days I sat with her as she licked her fingertips and painted stories of her childhood. She soon confessed her biggest fear \u2013 dying alone at home. She didn\u2019t want us rummaging in our armoury for something else to deflect the grip of death, as it inched closer. </p> <p>So we listened, and we stopped. A week later, Annette passed away, surrounded by her family. I had never before thought of what a good death should look like. But as I stroked her hair with prickling eyes, I knew that I had just witnessed one.</p> <p>I began to change my view of end-of-life conversations. I soon saw an irony in them: when it came down to it, done well, they were not about the end at all. They were more about life than any other conversations I had ever had with my patients. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/healthcare-network/2016/may/12/i-am-dying-want-talk-family-carer-doctors-death\">I am dying and I want everyone to talk about it</a> </p> </aside>  <p>This job has made me contemplate the questions Atul Gawande, a surgeon, writer, and public health researcher, so eloquently asks. Have we built our system around the few patients that exceed survival expectations, at the expense of preparing the rest for a more likely outcome? Through our struggle to curb our medical urges, are we failing to hear what really matters to them at a time when their choices should be most respected? Is there a tendency to preserve every fibre of life, to glorify longevity, over what actually makes our lives worth living?</p> <p>Our lives are stories, and we want to be the authors. And in stories, the endings count. I\u2019ve learnt that, as doctors, we need to be better at shaping those narratives, at helping patients with their endings. </p> <p>After six years of medical school, death is a certainty that I must admit I shrank away from. But a picture of Annette and her bucket of KFC is now etched in my memory.

  "<p>Seventeen year old Elise Harbud lives in a small rural village, and travels daily into Cambridge to attend her sixth form college. Because she is in the 16-18 age group, Harbud is obliged by law to attend either school or training, but she has no matching statutory right to school transport \u2013 and two thirds of local authorities no longer provide any free travel to school or college for over-16s. </p> <p>Harbud is lucky that Cambridgeshire council has brokered a deal with local train operators so that 16- to 18-year-olds can travel all across the county\u2019s rail network at half price rates. Her annual pass still costs \u00a3480, which her mum opts to pay in instalments. </p> <p>Unique in the country \u2013 and profitable despite the discount \u2013 the Cambridge scheme makes rail travel more affordable to young people, and is \u201ca better and cheaper service than the buses\u201d, says county councillor and rural transport campaigner Susan van de Ven.</p> <p>What if Harbud had to pay the full price of a rail pass \u2013 nearly a thousand pounds? The teenager laughs. \u201cThat would be difficult,\u201d she says. \u201cThere\u2019s just one income, from my mum. We\u2019d have to change how I travel.\u201d </p> <p>Alternatives to the train, which gets her to within 10 minutes walk of her sixth form, would be a longer, split journey on the bus, or driving Harbud explains. The inconvenience of the bus trip provides an effective disincentive to young people to bother going in to school: driving would add yet more trips to the 100m extra car journeys that the <a href=\"http://www.bettertransport.org.uk/cuts-school-transport-generate-100m-extra-car-journeys-year\" rel=\"nofollow\">Campaign for Better Transport (CBT) estimate</a> take place annually as a result of cuts to school transport since 2010.</p> <h2>A nationwide funding crisis</h2> <p>John Disney, a transport researcher from Nottingham Business School, warns that funding for rural transport is in crisis across the country. Massive cuts to rural bus services since 2010, when councils began to reduce or entirely withdraw their subsidy from routes that couldn\u2019t be run at a profit, are now, he says, creating an urban/rural divide. </p> <p>\u201cWe need to direct funding away from urban services to rural ones,\u201d says Disney, just before giving evidence to the transport select committee. \u201cIt needs central government strategy and direction \u2013 it can\u2019t be left to ad hoc action by councils.\u201d</p> <p>Cuts here and cuts there and not much strategic thought around what rural communities need from public transport appears however to be the reality in many areas. Disney describes vast swaths of the countryside now either poorly served or completely bereft of buses after the loss or reduction of council subsidy of non-commercial routes. Cumbria, he explains, scrapped all its subsidy for buses two years ago. In North Yorkshire, he says, it\u2019s \u201cless than a quarter of what it was\u201d. Derbyshire is currently consulting on axing all bus subsidies, \u201cwhich would leave much of the county with nothing\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/public-leaders-network/2016/aug/03/bus-services-bill-lords-local-authority-transport-devolution\">The bus bill could rob communities of high quality, affordable bus travel</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Community initiatives have done their best to plug some gaps: Cumbria council, Disney recounts, offered transport campaigners a free minibus, but local people had to provide their own volunteer driver.</p> <p>The Dales and Bowland community interest company attempted to restore the Saturday Skipton to Harrogate bus service, but because it ran three-quarters full with pensioners on free bus passes, which reimburses operators at a rate of \u00a31.30 per journey \u2013 far less than the \u00a37.50 commercial fare \u2013 it haemorrhaged funds. Self-help in transport, even on popular routes, doesn\u2019t always work. \u201cWe had to pull the service in March,\u201d says Disney.</p> <p>\u201cWhole communities have been left without any options, except for motorists,\u201d confirms Lianna Etkind at CBT. The impact on older people, who find it increasingly difficult to leave their rural village to socialise, to go shopping, or for medical appointments, is increasingly one of social isolation, she points out. And there\u2019s a public safety issue too. \u201cFor a lot of [older] people, there\u2019s that horrible moment when they face taking their car out and not feeling safe on country roads, or staying at home.\u201d Disney says he knows of older people living rurally who know they shouldn\u2019t be behind the wheel, but feel they have no other choice.</p> <h2>Destabilisation of the rural demographic</h2> <p>The virtual disappearance in some places of public transport is transforming the profile of who lives where, and what the economic and social mix of the countryside will look like in future, says Nick Richardson, a director of the Chartered Institute of Logistics and Transport. </p> <p>\u201cThe bus subsidy might seem like a cost that\u2019s easy to do away with, but it has some profound consequences, one of which is a destabilisation of the rural demographic.\u201d When young people with ambition and skills leave rural areas for jobs or higher education elsewhere, they can be reluctant to return in their 20s and 30s, he points out. Job opportunities are easier to access elsewhere, so \u201cwhat you get is increasingly [rural] settlements of middle class, middle-aged car owners,\u201d Richardson observes. </p> <p>The economic impoverishment of rural areas goes the other way as well: poor transport links mean that business investment is harder to achieve. At the Institute of Directors, Cheshire branch chair Jeff Hardman notes that across the country, businesses in rural locations find it hard to attract the best talent or clients, \u201cbecause their competitors are citing transport links and communications as reasons not to move out of central locations\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThe local infrastructure is what matters, and that suffers in relative terms,\u201d says his Cumbria counterpart Chris Ward. \u201cTake for example the trans-Pennine tunnel which is intended to link Manchester and Sheffield; to a degree, that\u2019s a positive investment which signals confidence in the region, but ultimately my concern lies in the fact that rural communities don\u2019t tend to benefit from upgraded major trunk routes like this. Suddenly it\u2019s quicker to travel 50 or 100 miles from [city] centre to [city] centre than it is to travel 20 or 30 miles on rural networks, and that matters to business.\u201d</p> <h2>Reasons to be cheerful</h2> <p>There is no doubt that local energy and creativity offers some reasons to be cheerful. Etkind says the \u00a320m recently announced by central government for the restoration of defunct train stations is a great opportunity to bring branch lines back to life \u2013 local communities must still come up with 25% of the cost, but CBT is producing a guide on how to undertake such a project. In Cambridgeshire, van de Ven is working hard to ensure that a new cycle superhighway linking villages along the A10 with public transport between Cambridge and the market town of Royston is open by 2018, with the specific purpose of linking rural communities with employment hubs. </p> <p>Nationally, it may be that the <a href=\"http://services.parliament.uk/bills/2016-17/busservices.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">bus services bill</a>, currently going through parliament, will offer rural authorities a more long-term degree of control and autonomy over buses, which will always be an essential lifeline to the most rural communities. While much of the publicity about the bill has focused on the automatic right it gives the new metropolitan mayors to operate their own franchised bus services, Etkind points out that other local councils can take advantage too.</p> <p>As the bill is currently drafted, she explains, they \u201chave to apply to the secretary of state and make their case\u201d to run their own bus franchise, cross-subsidising uncommercial routes with profitable ones. Her charity has put forward an amendment that would give councils the right to run their own service automatically \u2013 but whichever way the bill is passed, if councils are willing to put the work in, she says \u201cit offers real hope to rural authorities\u201d.</p> <p><strong>Talk to us on Twitter via </strong><strong><a href=\"https://twitter.com/guardianpublic\" rel=\"nofollow\">@Guardianpublic</a> and </strong><strong><a href=\"https://register.theguardian.com/public-leaders/\">sign up</a></strong><strong> for your free weekly Guardian Public Leaders newsletter with news and analysis sent direct to you every Thursday.</strong></p>",

But simply taking in a lodger while still living in the flat does not require a change to the mortgage rate you pay. </p> <p>Taking in a lodger can, however, affect your buildings and contents insurance, so you need to check with your insurers.

  "<p>Stephen Conroy\u2019s \u201c20 years, I\u2019m out of here\u201d moment last week presents Bill Shorten and Labor with a wonderful opportunity to add to the diversity of the Senate by nominating a person with lived experience of disability. Will they grasp it? <br> Why do we need representation? Australians with disabilities, 4.5 million of us, are employed at a rate 30% lower than the general population, and 45% of us live in or near poverty. Our educational outcomes, measured by high school completion, are half those of the general population. And we are disproportionately represented in the prison system.  We are the Australian disadvantaged minority that anyone can join. Those who are not yet part of us are just an accident away from a disability.  The 45th Australian parliament, whatever its other challenges, is diverse. There are a significant number of women, three people of Aboriginal and Torres Strait islander descent, at least three people of Muslim background, and many others who are culturally or linguistically diverse. There are also at least five members of the GLBTIQ community. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/sep/21/stephen-conroy-says-sorry-for-catching-colleagues-by-surprise-with-resignation\">Stephen Conroy says sorry for catching colleagues by surprise with resignation</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But there is no one who has declared lived experience of disability, and who is recognised as a representative by the disability sector. Given our numbers, our disadvantage, and the key reforms occurring which relate to us \u2013 the national disability insurance scheme \u2013 it\u2019s about time that changed. </p> <p>Our politicians recognise this. Our minister for foreign affairs Julie Bishop says: \u201cGreater diversity in leadership roles means the team is more likely to come up with new ideas, more creative approaches, and more flexible thinking and responses to challenges.\u201d </p> <p>On the other side of the parliament, Maria Vamvakinou has said <br>\u201cWe, the Australian parliament, are not as representative as we should be.\u201d</p> <p>Most Australians recognise the value of diversity in our country and in our parliament. Customer service organisations know that their staff profile should match that of their customers. The Australian Institute of Company Directors state that diverse boards are more effective boards. Diversity is not just the right thing to do, it\u2019s good business. </p> <p>Kelly Vincent, representing the Dignity for Disability party in the South Australian upper house is living proof of this fact. She is a powerful and effective advocate for South Australians with disabilities. She has raised the profile of disability in her state, and had the stamp of approval by electors, winning a second term. </p> <p>My target here is not just Labor. They currently have the opportunity, but all parties bear the responsibility of raising the standard in this regard, because the standards we walk past are the standards we accept. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/feb/03/australias-ndis-reform-recognises-that-disability-could-affect-any-of-us\">Australia's NDIS reform recognises that disability could affect any of us | Bill Shorten</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Where are the candidates with disabilities?

  "<p>Waste crime is the \u201cnew narcotics\u201d according to the head of the Environment Agency (EA), offering huge profits as the authorities race to catch up with the damage caused to society. </p> <p>Illegal waste activity costs England \u00a31bn a year and more than 1,000 illegal waste sites were discovered last year, more than in the previous two years combined, with 662 still active as of the end of March.</p> <p>The offences, sometimes involving organised crime gangs, ranged from illegal dumping of household and industrial waste to massive frauds involving recycling fees and landfill tax.

We are clear now about the damage waste crime does to communities and to the economy,\u201d he said. \u201cThe strategy is to work with the good guys and really nail the bad guys. \u201cWe are both finding more [illegal sites] and nailing more.

Terence Dugbo had defrauded the electrical waste recycling industry out of \u00a32.2m in a scam involving almost 20,000 tonnes of waste. He was caught when seized documents revealed waste had supposedly been collected from non-existent streets and, in one incident, a moped was recorded as carrying 991 televisions and 413 fridges in a single trip.</p> <p>In August, a <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/jail-for-sussex-waste-boss-who-illegally-stockpiled-over-1200-tonnes-of-wood\">Sussex man was jailed after illegally stockpiling</a> more than 1,200 tonnes of waste, having been arrested at Heathrow trying to board a plane to Dubai. In September a notorious <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/notorious-hants-waste-criminal-sentenced-to-30-weeks-imprisonment\">Hampshire waste criminal was sent to prison</a> for a string of offences including large-scale flytipping.

They take our waste away and turn it into something better and if we didn\u2019t have them, we\u2019d be in a bad place.\u201d</p> <p>Bevan spoke to the Guardian on a visit to Orion Support Services, a company in east London that handles 50,000 tonnes of construction waste from the city each year. Its permit was suspended in 2015 after serious dust problems.</p> <p>However, the company has now built a \u00a32.4m enclosed facility for sorting the waste, with a system that collects and bags 50 litres of dust an hour. \u201cIt was either that or shut up shop and go home,\u201d said John Stride, managing director of Orion Services. \u201cBut the turnaround has been amazing and it will pay back.\u201d</p> <p>Just a small percentage of the waste sorted by Orion goes to landfill, with most being recycled or burned for energy. \u201cIt just feels better now, when you are reusing it,\u201d Stride said, adding that a neighbour who had raised a 1,000-strong petition against Orion\u2019s operations was now \u201cvery friendly\u201d.</p> <p>Overall, England is much dealing better with waste than in the past, said Bevan. Rubbish sent to landfill has halved since 2000 and household recycling reached a new high in 2015 of 45%. However, the rising recycling rate has flattened out in recent years, and the proportion sent to landfill increased slightly in 2015.</p> <p>\u201cEngland is getting a better place to live - greener, cleaner and more prosperous,\u201d said Bevan. \u201cThere is more to do, absolutely, but the glass is half full.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt is in part an example of regulation working,\u201d said Bevan, a former high commissioner to India. \u201cI have seen an example of what happens if you don\u2019t regulate - the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhopal_disaster\">Bhopal disaster</a>.

  "<p>\u2022 This article has been footnoted<br></p> <p>Liverpool is preparing to host the Labour conference in the wake of bitter infighting between party factions.

Petty vandalism is not uncommon. But Sherlock House was no ordinary crime scene.

Eagle\u2019s camp blamed members of the hard left. Corbyn\u2019s countered that it could just have been a random act of vandalism.</p> <p>It has been an extraordinary summer for Labour on Merseyside, even by the standards of a party marked by splits and bouts of infighting. The area has been at the epicentre of many events in Labour\u2019s history, and in the last few months it became so again. While much of the drama was taking place in and around Westminster, there was unrest and discord outside the capital, and nowhere more so than Liverpool and its surrounding area. All the stresses and strains of a party shifting inexorably to the left are visible in the city and in Labour constituency parties such as Birkenhead, Wallasey and Liverpool Riverside, one of the biggest and most leftwing constituencies in the country.</p> <p>Labour\u2019s annual conference is being held this weekend in Liverpool. Corbyn\u2019s message, assuming he wins the leadership election \u2013 and Labour MPs are already behaving as if he has \u2013 will be one of reconciliation and a little contrition. But the tensions will be painfully evident. The official gathering is at the conference centre at Kings Dock, but Momentum, the organisation set up by Corbyn supporters after his election last September, will be holding a parallel conference 15 minutes\u2019 walk away at the Black-E arts and community centre.</p> <p>Beatles songs blare out from buskers all day long in Liverpool\u2019s Mathew Street where the Cavern club was originally situated. But there is much more to Liverpool than just the Fab Four. Its people are loud and opinionated, proud of their history and intensely loyal to their hometown. It is one of the great British cities that grew rich on transatlantic trade \u2013 in Liverpool\u2019s case, the slave trade. Like Glasgow and Belfast, it has a history of radicalism, political upheaval and ideological divides.<strong> </strong></p> <p>For three months, as part of a new experiment in collaborative reporting, I have been reporting on Labour in Liverpool at grassroots level, and publishing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/membership/ng-interactive/2016/jun/16/guardian-labour-liverpool-ewen-macaskill\">weekly updates on the Guardian website</a>. I chose Liverpool because of the seminal part it has played in the history of the British labour movement. It can lay claim to be the reddest city in the UK. From here, it is easier to see the impact of decisions made in the Labour leader\u2019s office in London or at the party headquarters or among MPs at Westminster. Only when sitting down with grassroots Labour members does it become evident just how widespread and deep is the anger with MPs over the attempted coup against Corbyn. And there is anger, too, over the decision by London headquarters to suspend almost all party activity for the duration of the summer. And anger over the massive purge, mainly of leftwingers, which is ongoing.</p> <p>All this looks very stark on Merseyside. Constituency Labour parties that had once gone about their business peacefully have become fractured, engulfed by allegations of infiltration by hard-left groups, of homophobia, antisemitism, intimidation and bullying.</p> <p>So much energy has been wasted on infighting at a time when Liverpool is desperately trying to cope with the impact of Conservative spending cuts. On one of my early trips to the city in the middle of June, I spoke to Councillor Peter Mitchell, one of 12 Liverpool councillors who backed Corbyn last year. We met in the council offices, housed in the magnificent Cunard Building on the Mersey waterfront. Built by the Cunard shipping line in the 20th century, it is a reminder of the days when Liverpool generated huge amounts of wealth. Today, most of that wealth is long gone. Although the city centre is enjoying regeneration, with smart pubs and restaurants, it still suffers from large pockets of deprivation. Mitchell put spending cuts at 58% in real terms over the past six years. \u201cLiverpool received the biggest cut of any core city in the country,\u201d he said. \u201cFact.\u201d</p> <p>Mitchell represents one of the most notorious areas in Liverpool, Croxteth, which made national headlines almost a decade ago when an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2007/aug/23/ukguns.ukcrime\">11-year-old boy was shot dead</a> in a car park in an act of gang violence. A year later, a BBC journalist had a gun pointed at her while reporting from there.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2015/jul/20/sign-up-to-the-long-read-email\">Sign up to the long read email</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Croxteth has improved since then, but deprivation is still all too evident. I visited a community centre there, run by Sharon Lee. \u201cWe get a lot of people coming through who have been affected by the spending cuts and do not know where to go,\u201d she said. \u201cOur food banks in Liverpool are overwhelmed. It is not just people on benefits. It is people who are on zero-hours contracts.\u201d</p> <p>At a time when Labour should be confronting the Conservative government over council spending cuts, it is instead consumed by its own future. The incident at Eagle\u2019s office seems to be a fitting metaphor for Labour\u2019s summer. A broken window in Merseyside. A shattered party across the country.</p> <h2>* * * </h2> <p><strong>Anyone on the left in Liverpool </strong>knows the area\u2019s political history and takes pride in it. Little of the wealth from the transatlantic trade filtered down. Living conditions have been unremittingly harsh, from the 19th century to the present day.</p> <p>In 1911, during an early show of trade union strength, there was a transport strike. A rally in the city centre attracted tens of thousands. Police baton-charged the crowd for 30 minutes, leaving many injured. A few days later, soldiers opened fire, killing two people. Winston Churchill, then home secretary, and fearful of further unrest, deployed the cruiser HMS Antrim on the Mersey and put more troops on the city\u2019s streets.</p> <p>In 1926, Liverpool played a prominent role in the national general strike. Merseyside\u2019s workers had prepared in advance for the dispute and an estimated 100,000 joined the strike. When a number of trams started running, strikers in Wallasey and Birkenhead attacked them and brought them to a halt.</p> <p>In 1984, two years after the local party had adopted the policies of the Trotskyist group Militant,<strong> </strong>Labour controlled Liverpool city council. Nowhere else in the country did Militant achieve as much power. Derek<strong> </strong>Hatton, who became deputy leader of Liverpool city council in 1983, challenged the Thatcher government over spending cuts, arguing that the council could not deliver essential services. In 1985, the council set an illegal budget committing it to an extra \u00a330m in spending, putting the council on a collision course with the government and Labour at national level.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"cb61f824d6e2ee8074d4acfef9ae6061a6f9e660\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cb61f824d6e2ee8074d4acfef9ae6061a6f9e660/38_0_1873_1123/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Derek Hatton outside the Labour Party Conference Blackpool, in 1985.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Derek Hatton outside the Labour Party Conference Blackpool, in 1985.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Don Mcphee/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Neil Kinnock, in one of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/1985/oct/02/labour.uk\">best-remembered speeches of his career</a>, denounced the actions of Liverpool city council at the party\u2019s 1985 party conference. \u201cYou can\u2019t play politics with people\u2019s jobs and people\u2019s homes and people\u2019s services,\u201d he said. In the aftermath, many Militant members were permanently expelled from the Labour party, including Hatton.</p> <p>In 1989, the city was left reeling when 96 Liverpool football fans were crushed to death during an FA Cup semi-final at Hillsborough stadium. The police and the Sun newspaper blamed the disaster on the fans. A swell of citywide solidarity brought an inquiry and eventual vindication in April this year, when a jury at the new inquests determined that the deaths were a result of gross negligence.</p> <p>The Liberal Democrats ran the council in the late 1970s and again between 1998 and 2010. But Labour dominance has since been restored. It has won 80 of the 90 seats on Liverpool city council and 14 of the 15 parliamentary seats on Merseyside.</p> <p>And then there was the brick.</p> <p>The vandalism at Angela Eagle\u2019s office was the first item on the agenda when Labour\u2019s ruling national executive committee (NEC) met in London on 12 July. Discussion about the broken window dominated the first part of the meeting, the main purpose of which was to was to decide whether Jeremy Corbyn would be allowed on the leadership contest ballot. To avoid any possible recriminations, the NEC decided to hold a secret vote. Corbyn won by 18 to 14. Just before 8pm, he left the meeting at Labour headquarters to speak to the press and a noisy group of supporters. Two of Corbyn\u2019s team also left.</p> <p>With the Corbynite majority reduced at the NEC meeting<strong>,</strong> a decision was reached that would have repercussions for the party across the country. The NEC ruled to deny the 150,000 members who had joined the party since 12 January <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/aug/12/labour-wins-appeal-against-ruling-allowing-new-members-a-leadership-vote\">a vote in the Labour leadership contest</a>.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/apr/26/hillsborough-disaster-deadly-mistakes-and-lies-that-lasted-decades\">Hillsborough disaster: deadly mistakes and lies that lasted decades</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The public line was that no one knew whether the 150,000 were pro- or anti-Corbyn. But in private, the party headquarters knew they were overwhelmingly pro. So as far as Corbyn\u2019s team was concerned, the ban was aimed at stopping him. The decision to restrict the vote created resentment, and a clause allowing anyone prepared to pay an extra \u00a325 to vote caused even further anger. The suspicion among Corbyn supporters was that this was aimed at impoverished members who would struggle to find \u00a325.</p> <p>In a move that caused more bad feeling, the NEC decided that \u201call normal party meetings at CLP and branch level shall be suspended until the completion of the leadership election\u201d, effectively the remainder of the summer.</p> <h2>* * * </h2> <p><strong>The Stork pub in Birkenhead has a strong sense of history.</strong> It opened in 1840, and many of its original, ornate features have been retained. On Wednesday 13 July, Labour party members gathered in one of the pub\u2019s larger rooms at about 5pm. It was a sunny evening and the windows and doors were left open to let in some air.</p> <p>What ensued felt like a moment from the past: a spirited political debate, animated but courteous, ideas bouncing back and forth, each being listened to politely. Technically, the meeting was a breach of party rules. The Birkenhead constituency party, like others around the country, had been informed in an email from party headquarters in London just hours earlier that all such meetings were now banned.</p> <p>The Stork meeting felt like an act of defiance by the members. But the initial reason for it was more prosaic. The evening had been intended as a meet-and-greet for new members. The constituency party official whose job it was to look after them, Sarah Evans, was concerned that they may not have received the message about the cancellation of the gathering, and that they would arrive in the pub to find no one there. She decided to go along anyway, just in case.</p> <p>About half a dozen people turned up, bemused when they were informed that the meeting had been officially cancelled. They were even more confused when a number of older members began to drift in. In the end, about 40 people packed the room. Such meetings might have been banned, but party headquarters could not stop informal ones taking place. At that moment, London felt very far away.</p> <p>Some questioned whether the ban on meetings had been imposed because MPs feared facing angry constituency members protesting about the botched coup against a leader less than a year in office. Or was it in response to the incident at Eagle\u2019s office?</p> <p>It was the first Labour party meeting for Anne McCluskey. She had been brought up in a Labour family, but was only joining the party now, at the age of 46. \u201cI was not a fan of Jeremy Corbyn. However, I do not like what has happened,\u201d she said. \u201cHe was voted as leader only a year ago and it looks like mutiny.\u201d McCluskey was also not happy about being told that she would not be able to vote in the leadership contest.</p> <p>The discussion passed to John Mather, who sounded even more annoyed. He had joined Labour in 1979, left in 2003 \u2013 the year of the Iraq invasion \u2013 joined the Greens in 2015, and returned to Labour when Corbyn was elected. He described the denial of a vote in the leadership campaign for the 150,000 new members as \u201can affront to democracy\u201d.</p> <p>I was curious to see what the reaction had been elsewhere on Merseyside, so I went on to an impromptu meeting in New Brighton, part of the Wallasey constituency. If Birkenhead was an act of mild defiance, the Wallasey meeting was an insurrection. It was all amicable enough, each speaker was given a hearing without interruption, but at the end, a vote of no confidence in Wallasey MP Angela Eagle was passed by 54 to nine. A second vote unanimously rejected the \u00a325 membership fee, which one of those in the hall denounced as \u201ca surcharge on democracy\u201d.</p> <p>After the meeting had wound up, at around 9pm many people headed to a nearby pub, where the discussion continued. Among them was Sarah Henney, who works in digital marketing. She was not, she said, \u201ca leftie\u201d but was upset with the parliamentary Labour party (PLP) over the coup attempt, and the way some MPs had referred to Corbyn supporters as Trotskyists, rabble and dogs. \u201cI would not call myself a Corbynista. I am just a working mum,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat other organisation would hold its members in such contempt?\u201d</p> <p>In the middle of this, Carmel Nolan \u2013 who lives on Merseyside and worked as press secretary to Corbyn during his leadership campaign last year \u2013 was talking on the phone with the Labour leader. She called for quiet and put Corbyn on speaker so that he could address the pub. The speech was uncontroversial, some bland remarks about bringing about economic and social change. It was not what he said that mattered, but that he was saying it to a group of Labour members and supporters on the day that party headquarters had suspended official gatherings.<strong> </strong></p> <h2>* * * </h2> <p><strong>Corbyn enjoys a majority on every party committee</strong> but one: the procedures committee. If that sounds boring and bureaucratic, it is not. The committee runs what are known as \u201cpurge panels\u201d, which sign off on each suspension or expulsion. The panels are small, with only three members, but there is a non-Corbyn majority on each. Software is used to scan social media for key words, in order to track down potential infiltrators from revolutionary leftwing parties, people who have expressed support for other parties, or have used inappropriate language such as \u201cBlairite scum\u201d to describe party members.</p> <p>One of the people caught up in Labour\u2019s purges is Liverpool children\u2019s author Alan Gibbons, who wrote a poem to commemorate Corbyn\u2019s visit to the city on 1 August.</p> <p>This week, Gibbons told me his application for Labour party membership has been declined. A former member of the Socialist Workers party who had become disillusioned with the organisation in the 1990s, he was attracted to Labour by Corbyn and applied to join six months ago.</p> <p>Assuming that he was a member, he attended a meeting of the Liverpool Walton constituency Labour party (CLP), which he said he had enjoyed. Then he received a letter saying that his application had been rejected because a tweet had been found in which he had expressed support for the Trade Union and Socialist Coalition, a leftwing grouping opposed to public spending cuts and in favour of renationalisation of the railways \u2013 both policies that are espoused by Corbyn.</p> <p>Gibbons was even more incensed by the treatment of his daughter, Rachel, aged 25, who has been purged too. \u201cShe has never been a member of any other party. She has only ever voted Labour,\u201d Gibbons said. She was suspended for retweeting two tweets from the Greens, one in support of a teachers\u2019 strike and one a comic video about the Conservatives, simply because she found it funny. \u201cMaybe it is because of her association with me. They are excluding people on spurious grounds,\u201d he said.</p> <p>An official Labour spokesperson, asked last week about the number of individuals who have been investigated and suspended, said the figure is a secret. But the Guardian has learned that the original number of those identified for potential suspension was 70,000. By August the purge panels had become overburdened by the sheer number of new members. Mistakes began piling up. People who had joined from the Greens found themselves being suspended, even though Labour MPs have said that they welcomed former Green members into the party.</p> <p>In the end, 60,000 cases were dropped. But that still leaves 10,000 people who have been suspended or told they are under investigation. Among them is the vice-chair of the Wallasey CLP, Paul Davies. Davies is reasonably well known in the Labour party in Merseyside. Decades earlier, he took part in a selection contest in Birkenhead with the sitting MP Frank Field and \u2013 according to Peter Kilfoyle, then Labour\u2019s north-west organiser \u2013 Davies won. Although Kilfoyle insisted that Davies was not a member of Militant or any other grouping, Field remained the Labour candidate.</p> <p>And there he was again, involved in controversy, under investigation. Katherine Buckingham, head of disputes and discipline, wrote to him on 2 August saying: \u201cThe national party has received complaints that you have used Labour party membership data to deliver promotional leaflets on behalf of a third party (copy attached) to the houses of party members in Wallasey, which may constitute an unauthorised use of the data of Labour party members. The Labour Party takes allegations of breaches of data protection extremely seriously.\u201d</p> <p>Davies was told that a response was required by the next day. The \u201cthird party\u201d was a meeting being organised in Wallasey Town Hall on 2 August for Labour members and supporters, sponsored by the Wirral TUC. Davies informed party headquarters that he had been in London on the day cited in the complaint and attached his rail tickets.</p> <p>It is not just Davies who is under investigation. The whole Wallasey party was suspended on 20 July pending an investigation into allegations of homophobic remarks at a party meeting. It means that Wallasey will not be able to play a full part in this weekend\u2019s conference.</p> <h2>* * * </h2> <p><strong>The Liverpool Riverside CLP </strong>has so far avoided suspension, even though it has a reputation for being even more fractious than Wallasey. The MP Louise Ellman, in an interview at her parliamentary office, said that before Corbyn became leader, party meetings had been respectful. Corbyn\u2019s election in September last year, however, she said, had brought an influx of new members, some of whom she blamed for argumentative behaviour and verbal abuse.</p> <p>Ellman, who is chair of the Jewish Labour Movement and vice-chair of Labour Friends of Israel, has complained officially about antisemitic remarks at Riverside party meetings, where the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is frequently raised. The Jewish Chronicle said that Ellman blamed \u201cactivists from the hard-left group Momentum\u201d.<strong> </strong>Ellman, who joined the vote of no confidence in Corbyn in July, put the membership of the Riverside party at 2,000 and said the antagonistic atmosphere at meetings could be attributed to only eight or nine people.</p> <p>The changing nature of the Riverside party is reflected in its nomination for leader: last year, it backed Yvette Cooper over Corbyn. This time around, with the help of new members, the vote was 117 to 37 for Corbyn over Owen Smith.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"9c649f17b0eed8c8dfaf751ab2bdabffe1809dd1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9c649f17b0eed8c8dfaf751ab2bdabffe1809dd1/0_0_5472_3283/1000.jpg\" alt=\"People cheer and hold placards as Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn addresses thousands of supporters in Liverpool, in August.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">People cheer and hold placards as Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn addresses thousands of supporters in Liverpool, in August.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christopher Furlong/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Last week an anonymous pamphlet was published titled \u201cAn Investigation into Far-Left Infiltration of the Labour Party in Liverpool since September 2015\u201d, by members opposed to Momentum and supportive of Ellman. It showed just how fractured the Riverside CLP had become. Under the sub-heading \u201cA party within a party?\u201d, it says: \u201cIt is not difficult to spot the obvious parallels in the respective conduct and practices of Liverpool Riverside Momentum and Militant in the 1980s. The group are actively recruiting to the local party with the objective of reshaping and \u2018democratising\u2019 the structure of the CLP to reflect their objectives. Throughout, (sic) internal discussions and memos they speak as though they are distinct from the Labour Party and speak of it as \u2018other\u2019 and on occasions refer to themselves as the \u2018left opposition\u2019 within the local party.\u201d</p> <p>The pamphlet said that more than 20 members of Riverside Momentum have been reported to the Labour party compliance unit for actively supporting and nominating other political parties as recently as this year. It names 11 key figures, saying that the vast majority have been \u201chard-left activists\u201d who have been operational in political parties and organisations hostile to the Labour party \u2013 some of whom have been involved in hard-left politics for decades.</p> <p>In the Liverpool Echo on Wednesday, Ellman drew a direct link between Militant and Momentum, calling for the suspension of the group. \u201cMomentum are clearly operating against the best interests of and, in many instances, in direct opposition to the Labour party,\u201d she said. \u201cNeither the Labour party nor the people of Liverpool can afford to travel down this road again.\u201d</p> <p>I saw the vicious side of the left on Merseyside in 1986, when Labour headquarters put up George Howarth as the party\u2019s candidate in what was then Knowsley North. On a dark, wet night, on his way into a party meeting, he had to run a gauntlet of angry activists \u2013 not necessarily Militant, but definitely from the hard left \u2013 baying at him, the police holding them back. That was intimidation.</p> <p>But over three months in Liverpool and Merseyside, this summer I never saw anything remotely approaching that. I have also covered Momentum since it was formed last autumn. At the head of the organisation are veteran leftwingers, such as Jon Lansman \u2013 one of Corbyn\u2019s closest advisers and a man well-versed in party infighting \u2013 but there are also young activists such as James Schneider, Momentum\u2019s spokesman, and Sam Tarry, who is press spokesman for Corbyn\u2019s leadership campaign. Both Schneider and Tarry are committed to<strong> </strong>Labour building a broader social movement on the left. They do not bear any resemblance to the leftwing activists who turned up in Knowsley North that night in 1986, or to Militant.</p> <p>The Guardian organised a pub meet-up at the Fly in the Loaf, in the centre of Liverpool, which is part of the Riverside constituency, to discuss the state of the party. About 80 people turned up, with a mixture of views, from Blairites to Momentum and even former Militant members. For its full 90 minutes, the meeting was conducted in a respectful, comradely fashion.</p> <p>Merseyside has one of the largest and most active concentrations of Momentum members. I have met a lot of the younger ones, such as Ross Quinn, Momentum\u2019s spokesperson on Merseyside. I have also met Elizabeth Hayden and Ed Mustill, who were named in the pamphlet about far-left infiltration. They are all too young to have been engaged in decades of hard left politics and come across as idealistic and passionate.</p> <p>Chris Jones, an academic who is also named in the pamphlet, said this week that he had been involved with groups such as the Socialist Workers party \u2013 though not, as the pamphlet claimed, the International Marxist Group. His past membership is not something he hides or is ashamed of. He started his political life in the Labour party and returned 12 months ago. He found the tone and tenor of the pamphlet objectionable, the idea that being in the Labour party was inconsistent with supporting workers involved in disputes or a campaign to save a hospital.</p> <p>Peter Kilfoyle is well placed to put the present tensions in context. He was sent by Neil Kinnock to root out Militant from Liverpool in the 1980s \u2013<strong> </strong>this earned him the nickname of Witchfinder General. One of a family of 14, he worked on the Liverpool docks before becoming a teacher and then Labour regional organiser for the north-west of England in 1986. In 1991, he was elected MP for Liverpool Walton, and he held on to the seat until 2010. He was also one of a quartet of advisers who Tony Blair turned to in 1994 when he was considering running for the party leadership<strong>.</strong></p> <p>Sitting in the lounge of the Hard Days Night hotel, Kilfoyle said: \u201cI don\u2019t see any real comparison with Militant, which was a tightly organised, highly motivated group with a particular ideological stance \u2013 quite clear and with a strategy which had been well thought out and which was inimical to the interests of the Labour party. I have never seen anything remotely to suggest that Momentum is anything like that.</p> <p>\u201cI see it more as a reaction to [the new Labour group] Progress, representing the rightward elements of the Labour party, and Momentum taking up the cause of the left. It is as simple as that.\u201d</p> <h2>* * * </h2> <p><strong>On 15 July, four days after Eagle announced</strong> her challenge to Corbyn, police arrested a 44-year-old man in Paisley on suspicion of threatening, via email, to kill her. He was questioned by Merseyside police and is out on bail. On the same day that the broken window was reported, Eagle\u2019s office also disclosed that she had changed the location of a planned campaign visit to Luton that evening because of alleged threats. Many in Eagle\u2019s CLP back her claims that she has become a victim of verbal and online abuse. One of her supporters, Liscard councillor Bernie Mooney, has also been subjected to hundreds of vile emails and phone messages.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"6efc1e3aa5f42faf9322b9e54c83a6fd281172a1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6efc1e3aa5f42faf9322b9e54c83a6fd281172a1/783_0_1931_1931/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The broken window at Angela Eagle\u2019s constituency office in Wallasey.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The broken window at Angela Eagle\u2019s constituency office in Wallasey.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Lauren Brown/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But was there a brick? I asked Merseyside police, who said that the person responsible had not been found. The police statement on the day did not mention a brick, only that \u201cdamage was caused to the front ground-floor window of an office\u201d. I went to Sherlock House to speak to one of the businessmen who shares Eagle\u2019s office, and who reportedly was the first person to spot the damage. I met him in the reception area. He was reluctant to speak about it. Had there been a brick? He would not say, though he did add that there had been a lot of assumptions about the incident.</p> <p>Within an hour, as I was walking along Bold Street in the centre of Liverpool, I received a phone call from Imran Ahmed, head of communications on the \u201cAngela for Labour Leader\u201d campaign. He asked why I had gone to Sherlock House and said that the Guardian was treating the incident as if it was Watergate. He informed me he had banned party staff at the constituency office from speaking to me and that Eagle would not be speaking to me either.</p> <p>The first reference I have found to a brick is in a press release that Ahmed sent out after 1pm on 12 July, under the headline \u201cViolence and threats in past 24 hours\u201d. It reported: \u201cA spokesperson for Angela Eagle said: \u2018A brick was thrown through the window of Angela Eagle\u2019s constituency office in Wallasey either overnight or this morning.\u2019\u201d (See footnote.)</p> <p>As well as the newspapers and television crews who turned up at Sherlock House, the Merseyside police and crime commissioner Jane Kennedy judged the incident important enough to merit a visit. Kennedy, a former Labour MP, was quick to apportion blame. \u201cWhat concerns me is there are those on the hard left creating a climate by their words that some people think gives them the green light to do these kind of things,\u201d she said.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Liverpool is important to Corbyn, who has praised the city\u2019s radical tradition</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>With no evidence to connect the brick to either side, Eagle herself called on Corbyn to get his supporters under control.</p> <p>The row over the brick upset both sides. A window damaged sounds minor. A window \u201cbricked\u201d is much more incendiary. It hints at a faction out of control, prone to violence, out to smash the party. The response of the left wing of the CLP was a sense of outrage over the instant association of their views with violence.</p> <h2>* * * </h2> <p><strong>Liverpool is important to Corbyn,</strong> who has praised the city\u2019s radical tradition. The city marked a turning point for him in last year\u2019s contest. When he started his leadership campaign, no one in his team \u2013 not even Corbyn himself \u2013 thought he had any chance. The realisation that he might win came at Liverpool\u2019s historic Adelphi Hotel. Hundreds \u2013 unusual at that time for a political event \u2013 turned up to hear him deliver an anti-austerity speech.</p> <p>When he returned to Liverpool on 1 August, on the campaign trail for yet another leadership contest, thousands turned up for a rally in the city centre on a rainy night. A few days earlier, Owen Smith, Corbyn\u2019s challenger, had attracted 300 at the most.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"07d93c1a507e3f840920b787410dc8b5b0cfc70d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/07d93c1a507e3f840920b787410dc8b5b0cfc70d/941_22_2032_2032/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jeremy Corbyn leaves a rally in Liverpool, attended by thousands of supporters, wearing a Liverpool FC scarf.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jeremy Corbyn leaves a rally in Liverpool, attended by thousands of supporters, wearing a Liverpool FC scarf.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christopher Furlong/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>So what will happen at the Labour conference? Corbyn is scheduled to speak at the Momentum rally as well as Labour\u2019s. His team views Momentum as the future, a modern alternative to what they consider to be outmoded campaign techniques. They want the Momentum campaign to be community-based, a social movement that engages with a wide range of groups and local issues.</p> <p>Assuming Corbyn wins, he will have the leader\u2019s office, the support of members, the backing of the unions and, from October, a majority of one on the NEC. He can then begin his takeover of party headquarters.</p> <p>The story of Labour and Liverpool still has a long way to run. Croxteth councillor Peter Mitchell was by Corbyn\u2019s side when he addressed the crowd in August. He will be with him again on Saturday for what is expected to be a celebration of his renewed leadership.</p> <p>Mitchell recognises that it will be difficult for Liverpool city council to make ends meet next year and is pushing for the government to return funds to the city. He said that Corbyn will lead this campaign.</p> <p>But for Mitchell, the party has already moved to the left. He noted the doubling of membership since Corbyn had taken over and the anti-establishment mood across Europe and the US. \u201cIt is a desire for a different kind of politics, for a different message,\u201d Mitchell said. \u201cAnd I believe Jeremy is the only person who can bring forward a government of the progressive left.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 Clarification, 15 December 2016: In this article, Ewen Macaskill wrote: \u201cThe first reference I have found to a brick is in a press release that Ahmed sent out after 1pm on 12 July...\u201d In fact, the reference to the brick was made in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/jul/12/labour-nec-jeremy-corbyn-leadership-from-labour-leadership-ballot-would-be-sordid-fix-politics-live?page=with:block-5784c9f2e4b0ea445f0fe67e#block-5784c9f2e4b0ea445f0fe67e\">Guardian\u2019s live blog</a> at 11.45am on 12 July: \u201cA brick was thrown through the window of Angela Eagle\u2019s constituency office overnight, BuzzFeed reports.

Congress has so far failed to do so; activists blamed Republican leaders for inaction.</p> <p>Clarke noted that Wednesday\u2019s panel discussion was taking part in the Lyndon Johnson room, named after the president who signed voting rights into law. She warned: \u201cWhat I can tell you is this: the world has changed in the absence of section 5 of the Voting Rights Act. Officials at the state and the local level have exploited every opportunity they can to institute or maintain discriminatory voting practices in the absence of section 5. <br></p> <p>\u201cEach day that Congress fails to act, we not only subject African Americans and other minority voters to the recurring indignity of voter discrimination but taxpayers suffer too. North Carolina has spent nearly $5m defending its discriminatory voter suppression law; Texas has spent more than $3.5m defending its discriminatory voter ID law. And the price tag increases each day.<br><br>\u201cVoter discrimination, if left unchecked, will stand as a stain on our democracy. It is bad for taxpayers, it is bad for Americans. It is time for Congress to stop turning a blind eye to the resurgence of voter discrimination in our country.\u201d</p> <p>Recent restrictions passed by 14 states include new photo ID requirements, a reduction in early voting days and the abolition of same-day registration. Voter fraud is often cited as a reason but experts said the problem is \u201cminuscule\u201d.</p> <p>Civil rights stalwart John Lewis, a Democratic Representative from Georgia, was in the room when Johnson signed the Voting Rights Act. But he said during this year\u2019s primaries he came across a couple who had been married for 40 but were told to vote at separate polling stations.<br></p> <p>\u201cIn the past few months and years I\u2019ve traveled across the country and I know that there is a deliberate persistent systematic effort to make it harder and more difficult for the disabled, student, senior, minority, the poor and rural voters to participate in the democratic process.

He said some of these decisions were made unfairly, without natural justice and without the companies providing a reasonable opportunity to allow those affected to respond.</p> <p>\u201cThis is pushing these people to a point where they\u2019ve really got nothing to turn to, and it pushes them over the edge in many cases,\u201d Bennett said. \u201cThey\u2019re putting people in very vulnerable positions to the point where their health and generally their wellbeing is being placed under threat.\u201d</p> <p>A spokesman for the Department of Employment acknowledged that private contractors played a role in assessing the behaviour of income support payment recipients, but said it provided clear requirements and training on how to appropriately monitor them.</p> <p>Leigh Markovic approached the AUWU after her experiences with her employment provider left her willing to give up her Centrelink payments and become homeless, simply to avoid the stress.</p> <p>The 21-year-old was part of an employment scheme run by Max Employment. The company is one of the largest private contractors involved in the administration of jobseeker programs.</p> <p>But she said she found dealing with the company to be difficult, and said some caseworkers had been unsympathetic and had treated her with contempt. She wanted to find a hospitality job but found the work-for-the-dole program to be increasingly stressful.</p> <p>\u201cI would just start crying at every appointment,\u201d she said. \u201cI didn\u2019t realise how much worse my mental state was when I was dealing with them. I went in with all these high hopes and goals and just left there feeling stupid, like nobody was going to help me.\u201d</p> <p>Markovic suffers from depression and anxiety, and underwent surgery in August. But she had an appointment scheduled with Max Employment three days after the surgery, which she didn\u2019t believe she would be well enough to attend, so contacted the company repeatedly to ask it for another date.</p> <p>The company sent her a text message, seen by Guardian Australia, advising her that the appointment would be pushed back several weeks. But later on the same day she received another text that said her Centrelink payments had been suspended.</p> <p>\u201cHi LEIGH. Pls call us ASAP \u2026 as you have missed an appt and your Centrelink payment has been suspended under the law. MAX Employment,\u201d it said.</p> <p>Markovic said she had not been given an opportunity to respond. Bennett said the decision was part of a broader problem: private companies were being delegated the power to make decisions on Centrelink\u2019s behalf.</p> <p>\u201cIt puts an extraordinary amount of power in the hands of private companies,\u201d he said.</p> <p>The suspension was revoked a day later by Max Employment, but Markovic said it caused her considerable distress. She finally lodged a complaint with the Department of Education, which oversees complaints relating to the jobseeker contract. Guardian Australia has contacted the department to determine the outcome of the complaint, but it said it could not respond due to privacy reasons.</p> <p>Max Employment\u2019s chief operating officer, Darren Hooper, acknowledged the text message had been sent in error to Markovic due to a different staff member logging the appointment change, and that there had been no impact on her payment because the suspension was revoked a day later.</p> <p>Hooper said he had apologised to Markovic about the suspension notice. But he said his staff strove to support Markovic and all their clients, and that Max Employment\u2019s \u201cwhole office service is about creating a positive environment\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cOur staff do act professionally. We provide training, education and we have regular audit checking,\u201d he said. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean that on some occasions there aren\u2019t errors in judgment and mistakes.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI would say that we could have serviced her better and that there were actions we took we shouldn\u2019t have taken around the appointment.\u201d</p> <p>He also said Max Employment was not contacted by the Department of Employment in relation to Markovic\u2019s complaint.</p> <p>Bennett said while the private companies bore some responsibility, it was ultimately the government that should be overseeing employment schemes more effectively, and that it was \u201cthe role of government\u201d to ensure the job scheme was working appropriately.<strong tabindex=\"-1\"><br tabindex=\"-1\"></strong></p> <p>\u201cAll they [the companies] do is just press a button and 10% of their unemployment entitlement can be taken away, and it will take them three months to get it back.\u201d</p> <p>For a person to successfully appeal a decision to cancel their Centrelink payments they must challenge the decision in the administrative appeals tribunal, which can take months. <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Legal advice provided to the AUWU said there may be a number of types of \u201cpotential unlawfulness\u201d that the government is engaged in, and recommended that they begin to collect documentation from affected jobseekers.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>When asked about the AUWU\u2019s potential action, a spokesman for the Department of Employment said: \u201cThe Department of Human Services has responsibility and delegation to investigate and determine if compliance failures have occurred under social security law.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe Department of Employment contracts employment services providers to deliver the jobactive programme. When job seekers are required to participate in work for the dole, jobactive providers are required to monitor participation and where non-attendance occurs, follow up with the job seeker and seek to re-engage the job seeker in the activity.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIf jobactive providers are unable to contact the job seeker to discuss the reason for non-attendance, or do not believe the reason given for the non-attendance is satisfactory, they are able to report the non-attendance to DHS.

The law of consent in most states is between 16 and 18, although in many states teens younger than 16 can have consensual sexual contact with each other provided the age gap is not more than four years.</p> <p>By all accounts Weiner and the 15-year-old did not meet or have any physical contact. He allegedly sent her explicitly sexual messages and asked her to undress and masturbate over video chat. When an exchange escalated and he allegedly tried to engage her in talk of a rape fantasy, she objected and he dropped the subject, according to the Daily Mail\u2019s report.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5c0c45942499bd2316d40665a6c6f33a22eaa249\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5c0c45942499bd2316d40665a6c6f33a22eaa249/75_0_1603_962/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Anthony Weiner.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Anthony Weiner.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Everett/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Weiner reportedly admitted to the Daily Mail that he had engaged in flirtatious exchanges with the girl but did not comment further on any of the specific allegations. He maintained that some of the details may be a hoax.</p> <p>In some screenshots accompanying the report, Weiner\u2019s picture and name can be seen on screen. In a statement to the Daily Mail, Weiner said, in part: \u201cI have repeatedly demonstrated terrible judgement about the people I have communicated with online and the things I have sent. I am filled with regret and heartbroken for those I have hurt.\u201d</p> <p>He sent a <a href=\"http://www.foxnews.com/us/2016/09/21/new-low-disgraced-dem-anthony-weiner-sorry-after-texts-to-15-year-old-revealed.html\">similar</a> statement to Fox News and also apologized for his behavior, while repeating that he may be the subject of a hoax.</p> <p>According to Wednesday\u2019s report, Weiner and the 15-year-old used apps such as Kik and Confide where much of the material exchanged or the identity of the sender is automatically deleted.</p> <p>But the girl reportedly took some screenshots of certain images and words.</p> <p>\u201cA situation such as this could involve an array of crimes, depending on what is done and what a minor is asked for,\u201d said John Wilkinson, an attorney adviser and former prosecutor with Aequitas, a consultancy and research organization that advises on prosecuting violence against women.</p> <p>Any investigation into Weiner could involve child sex abuse images or child endangerment statutes. There are also federal laws prohibiting the sexual exploitation of children and other statutes involving the transfer of obscene materials to a minor. Wilkinson also explained that even if an adult claims a teenager initiated contact and they did not realize their young age, that is not accepted as a defense in court.</p> <p>If the two people are in different states, or even if they are in the same state but use digital services such as Skype, which often have their servers located in another state, then a situation involving a 51-year-old and a 15-year-old could be investigated under federal as well as state criminal laws.</p> <p>Azi Paybarah, a senior reporter at Politico, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Azi/status/778671013039144960\">posted</a> on Twitter on Wednesday afternoon that New York Governor Andrew Cuomo had been asked about the latest scandal and Cuomo said that if the latest report was true it was \u201csick\u201d and potentially \u201ccriminal\u201d.</p> <p>After the August scandal, Weiner first denied and then <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/02/nyregion/anthony-weiner-confirms-child-welfare-agency-is-\">admitted</a> that he was being investigated by New York\u2019s child services authorities.</p>"
