A spokesman said the data would be used to help ministries see where more efforts were needed.</p> <p>Such ethnicity-based data is already collected and analysed in a number of parts of public services.

The documents, according to Labor, are nothing to do with national security but do show failings and cost blowouts in the construction of Australia\u2019s highly politicised national broadband network.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/audio/2016/aug/25/stephen-conroy-talks-to-katharine-murphy-about-the-humiliating-nbn-documents-australian-politics-live-podcast\">Stephen Conroy talks to Katharine Murphy about the 'humiliating' NBN documents \u2013 Australian politics live podcast</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Labor argues the Coalition is particularly sensitive about the leaks because they show that despite Malcolm Turnbull\u2019s promise the Coalition could deliver a cheaper NBN in less time than Labor\u2019s plan, it is now over budget and behind schedule. </p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/aug/24/police-to-raid-parliament-house-department-over-nbn-leak-says-stephen-conroy\">The execution of a second series of search warrants this week</a> by the AFP at Parliament House in the course of this investigation made for plenty of dramatic stock video footage as police officers scurried through parliament. And it\u2019s provoked a political tit for tat between Labor senator Stephen Conroy and the prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, over the AFP\u2019s decision to take up the case and their independence. To add to the complicated legal issues at play, Labor <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/aug/25/cory-bernardi-signals-he-may-back-labor-over-controversial-nbn-raids\">has also made a claim of parliamentary privilege</a> over some of the documents that have been seized by the AFP.</p> <p>But if you peer beyond the back and forth there are some urgent and pressing issues the raids throw up that go to the heart of Australia\u2019s political system. And they raise vital concerns for all journalists in Australia.</p> <p>We know that the federal police have been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2015/jan/22/journalists-reporting-on-asylum-seekers-referred-to-australian-police\">quite active in pursuing journalists\u2019 sources</a> with a view to prosecuting them. This often occurs in politically sensitive areas such as immigration. Whistleblowers from the detention system have had their phone records accessed. My own email and phone records <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/apr/14/federal-police-admit-seeking-access-to-reporters-metadata-without-warrant\">were obtained by the AFP</a> as part of an investigation into my sources from the detention system. All of this has been done under the still quite serious offence under s70 of the Crimes Act which specifically prohibits disclosures made by commonwealth officials. This offence targets the source, not the journalist.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/aug/24/police-to-raid-parliament-house-department-over-nbn-leak-says-stephen-conroy\">Federal police raid Parliament House over alleged NBN leak</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But what\u2019s unusual about the NBN raids is that the even more serious \u201cofficial secrets\u201d offence <a href=\"http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ca191482/s79.html\">under s79 of the Crimes Act</a> is now being invoked to seek to investigate \u2013 and potentially prosecute \u2013 the Labor staffer Andrew Byrne himself for allegedly receiving the documents as well as the unnamed source for disclosing them, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/davidlipson/status/768263181718302720\">according to the warrants issued.</a></p> <p>No charges have been brought against Byrne but the investigation is obviously active.</p> <p>There are two early conclusions that could be drawn from the AFP\u2019s decision to investigate Byrne for allegedly receiving an official secret. The first is that the offence is being used as a way to get their search warrants over the line, in order to work out the source of the NBN leaks. If this were true then it could be seen as a serious abuse of process.</p> <p>The second is that the AFP really are serious about throwing the book at Byrne. And if that\u2019s the case then it would be probably the first time in Australia\u2019s history that the official secrets offence has been used to target someone for anything short of serious espionage.</p> <p>The AFP\u2019s argument will no doubt be that the NBN is a core part of national infrastructure \u2013 and that the documents disclosed are a matter of national security capable of reaching the threshold of an official secret.</p> <p>That\u2019s not how official secrets have traditionally been considered though. And the use of the offence is even more bizarre given the controversy over whether NBN employees could even be considered \u201ccommonwealth officers\u201d \u2013 a point quite rightly flagged by Conroy. As Conroy has repeatedly highlighted, the NBN Co has an <a href=\"http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/nbnca2011336/s95.html\">express statutory clause</a> outlining that it is not a public authority. How then can the officers the AFP are investigating as the sources of the alleged leak be considered commonwealth officers?</p> <p>This entire process has obviously alarmed Labor, but it should be alarming journalists as well. The worrying prospect for journalists in Australia is that the same offence could be used to justify not only executing search warrants of a news organisation, but even the prosecution of a journalist who has received a bundle of leaked documents that embarrass the commonwealth government. </p> <p>If the AFP can seriously mount the case that disclosing documents about the NBN is matter of national security serious enough to invoke the official secrets offence, then the case could equally be made in many other areas. Immigration springs to mind as one area where the AFP has already been active in seeking to investigate and prosecute sources. But why not housing? Why not finance and banking? That most nebulous idea of national security could be twisted to suit the politics of the day.</p> <p>There would be nothing to stop the federal police investigating a journalist as the alleged perpetrator of the official secrets offence by simply doing their job: being in receipt of documents that show wrongdoing by commonwealth officials.</p> <p>Labor\u2019s battle against the federal police raids should be seen as a threat to every journalist and news organisation in the country. If the federal police investigation is ultimately successful, it sets a most dangerous precedent over the reach of the official secrets offence. And it may embolden them to one day pursue a journalist in the same way.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p>",

They don\u2019t necessarily matter to everyone but they have undoubtedly played a part.</p> <p>Ken Parish, a law lecturer and former Labor MLA, said the chaos of the CLP\u2019s term was probably not much greater than that during the Rudd and Gillard Labor years, and voters were just equally sick of it.</p> <p>\u201cMy perception is that the big issues for Territorians are the chaos, dysfunction, disunity, the revolving door, members leaving and getting down to a minority, the successful leadership coup, followed by the unsuccessful coup because Giles refused to go, and then a succession of tawdry misdeeds by assorted people culminating in Mr Barrett, and \u2026 the privatisations were a big thing.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Privatisation</strong></h2> <p>The 99-year lease of the Darwin port made national headlines and<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2015/nov/19/malcolm-turnbull-shrugs-off-us-concern-over-darwin-port-lease-to-chinese-firm\"> put the wind up the White House,</a> but closer to home people are much more upset about the CLP\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/aug/15/northern-territory-election-adam-giles-admits-failures-over-insurance-privatisation\">sale of the Territory Insurance Office</a>. </p> <p>The sale of the last state-owned insurance company caused huge distress among Territorians needing affordable insurance against natural disasters in a small and uncompetitive market. </p> <p>Parish said the port, TIO, and the Darwin bus service privatisation were all things the government \u201chad really little or no mandate for, hadn\u2019t really consulted about, and people didn\u2019t consent to.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThey might well have been sensible economic decisions, but people I think certainly felt and still feel like the CLP were high-handed and didn\u2019t take notice of what people wanted.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/jul/27/northern-territory-detention-inquiry-must-address-racism-say-indigenous-advocates\">Northern Territory detention inquiry must address racism, say Indigenous advocates</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Giles concedes they did not bring the people along with them in making the decision, and has pledged \u2013 several times over the last two years \u2013 to become more consultative. On Thursday he said he would resign if a CLP government sold the Power and Water company.</p> <h2><strong>The economy</strong></h2> <p>The Northern Territory is facing tough times with shrinking GST returns, a falling housing market, predicted unemployment rises, and the winding down of the major Inpex resource project.</p> <p>The CLP campaign has largely centred on the Territory\u2019s financials, spruiking the government\u2019s reduction of \u201cLabor debt\u201d, and its plans for jobs, almost a third of which they said would come from an expanded onshore gas industry.</p> <p>\u201cWe know there are heavy economic challenges coming,\u201d Giles said on Friday morning.</p> <p>\u201cWe spent the last four years getting the budget back on track, paying back debt and getting an economic plan to go ahead. And we have tabled our plan for 24,000 new jobs.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLabor has not tabled any plan on bringing any investment dollars to the Territory. They have not brought forward a plan to grow private sector jobs,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cThere is no way that the Territory won\u2019t go into recession under Labor.\u201d</p> <p>Labor has promised a surplus by 2019-20, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/aug/25/labor-win-in-northern-territory-would-mean-delay-or-cuts-of-223m-in-projects\">provided it can find enough savings to cover the extra $223.5m needed</a> to cover their election commitments, pledging to \u201cmake the tough decisions\u201d on funding projects instead of going over budget.</p> <p>It plans to consolidate public service departments, axing 26 executive roles to save $9m annually in salaries, and redeploying another 80 positions.</p> <p>It has also labeled the CLP jobs promise \u201cmisleading\u201d and containing exaggerations of the gas industry\u2019s projected jobs figures.</p> <h2><strong>Personality</strong></h2> <p>This is unavoidable. During the campaign Giles has repeatedly said the public is sick of \u201cpersonality politics\u201d, but has it ended?<br></p> <p>Giles has been implicated in many of the CLP scandals, but his inconsistent messaging has also tired voters. It was near impossible to keep track of his position following the Don Dale footage, and he has backtracked on a number of statements, sometimes within days. On Thursday he told the people\u2019s forum he <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/aug/25/adam-giles-says-he-wont-support-sexuality-element-of-safe-schools-program\">would not introduce the Safe Schools program</a> to prevent bullying of LGBTQI kids, a week after he told a social services debate that he would.<br></p> <p>The well-documented individual clashes dominated the narrative of parliamentary sittings and were behind more than one resignation from the CLP. </p> <p>Two of the CLP\u2019s most controversial figures, David Tollner and John Elferink, are leaving politics at this election. </p> <p>The CLP instability began just seven months into the term, when Giles rolled chief minister Terry Mills, in a move ABC election analyst Anthony Green described as \u201creminiscent of politics in newly emerging African nations in the 1960s\u201d.<br></p> <p>Mills returned as an independent just a few weeks ago, vowing it had nothing to with revenge.</p> <p>Delia Lawrie, the former Labor leader who was replaced by Gunner after she lost credibility over a union scandal, is also running as an independent, as is ex-CLP member and parliamentary speaker Kezia Purick, and former CLP minister Robyn Lambley.</p> <p>Indigenous activist and artist Jack Green is running on an anti-fracking platform for the seat encompassing his home town of Borroloola, but faces tough competition.</p> <p>Trevor Jenkins, rubbish warrior, is having another tilt.</p> <p>Alison Anderson, former Atsic commissioner, former member of Labor, the CLP, Palmer United, and current independent, announced she would not contest the election and was then pictured in a Labor T-shirt helping with the campaign.</p> <p>And who knows what <a href=\"http://gu.com/p/5v2f4?CMP=Share_iOSApp_Other\">Larisa Lee</a> will do if she retains her seat.</p> <p>The ballot paper holds a record number of candidates, including a significant proportion of independents, but as is evident many of them are people who abandoned one of the majors. 1Territory, founded by two former CLP presidents, touts itself as an alternative conservative party but with policies such as legalising marijuana.</p> <h2><strong>Indigenous affairs</strong></h2> <p>The 2012 election was won on the \u201cbush vote\u201d, but how the Northern Territory\u2019s Indigenous population has or will vote this time is unknown. The small electoral population and low enrolment mean seats could be swung on a strong family or community network, but <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/aug/19/political-leaders-urged-to-reform-ways-of-dealing-with-northern-territory-youth-offenders\">issues such as juvenile justice, housing and jobs hit particularly hard in remote communities</a>. </p> <p>The CLP got rid of the Indigenous affairs portfolio when it took office, and then reintroduced it last year. It introduced a number of programs including \u201ccommunity champions\u201d to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2015/nov/03/crocodile-eggs-and-3d-printing-could-these-be-champions-of-the-top-ends-indigenous-communities\">mentor small business ventures in remote communities</a>. Both parties have made promises on remote housing and employment programs. </p> <p>Labor accused the CLP of an \u201coutrageous, cynical betrayal\u201d when it released costings showing far less than their promised $1.6bn for remote housing, after most remote-living Territorians had already voted.</p> <h2><strong>The environment</strong> </h2> <p>It\u2019s the nature of the Territory that environmental and economic concerns often overlap and sometimes compete. The cattle industry is a lifeblood industry, but then<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/aug/23/timing-of-nt-governments-secret-deal-with-tri-star-coal-company-queried\"> so is the resources sector</a> and tourism. </p> <p>The environmental defenders office (EDO) NT scored the available written policies of four parties \u2013 the CLP, Labor, the Greens, and 1Territory. The CLP failed, scoring just 12.5/36, with a noted lack of transparency, climate change policy, and commitment to enforce planning law breaches. </p> <p>Labor and the Greens policies scored 31 and 25 respectively, and 1Territory was given 22.</p> <p>The CLP faced criticism in the last week of the campaign over a perceived lack of action over an oil spill in Darwin harbour, but Giles said it was his party to establish the \u201cpoliceman-like\u201d Environmental Protection Agency, a move the EDO called a step forward.</p> <p>After the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2015/oct/19/tiwi-islands-port-project-needs-no-environmental-risk-assessment-epa\">embarrassment of Port Melville on the Tiwi Islands</a>, which was built without environmental assessment, both major parties have pledged to close the legislative loopholes which allowed it to happen.</p> <p>They part ways significantly when it comes to fracking. Labor has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/apr/19/fracking-northern-territory-referendum-labor-delia-lawrie\">promised a moratorium</a>, followed by either a ban or a highly regulated industry to be decided in its first term. The CLP has pegged a third of its jobs plan to onshore gas.</p> <h2><strong>Law and order, alcohol, and Don Dale </strong></h2> <p>Is Don Dale a factor?</p> <p>Yes and no. The entire country was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/jul/26/northern-territory-youth-detention-no-excuse-for-not-knowing-of-abuse\">shocked by the footage broadcast on Four Corners</a>, but Territorians have also been dealing with high rates of property and violent crime, particularly by young offenders. It has meant that the CLP\u2019s continued push for a \u201ctough on crime\u201d approach, once they had made appropriate noises about the royal commission, played relatively well. So did some of the attacks launched against Four Corners.</p> <p>Parish said the report horrified people but it was more a \u201cnail in the coffin\u201d for the CLP, further highlighting \u201cdisunity and incompetence\u201d.</p> <p>The cost of the commission is an unknown for the next government, with a possible $32m payable by the NT. Gunner referred to it a \u201clegacy issue\u201d because it wasn\u2019t sorted out before caretaker period stepped in.</p> <p>The royal commission is also looking into child protection, a fraught issue in the NT with an overworked and frequently criticised Department of Families and Children struggling to deal with the rates of children at risk. The ALP, CLP and Greens were all given a tick by the NT council of social services for policies to outsource out of home care services and to establish an Aboriginal-controlled service.</p> <p>As part of its \u201ctough on crime\u201d measures the CLP government will introduce a bill to remove the presumption of bail for repeat offenders, and Labor has pledged to focus on early intervention and rehabilitation. </p> <p>The two parties are split on alcohol policy, another highly contentious and divisive NT issue. Labor has pledged to bring back its Banned Drinkers Register in concert with a suite of complementary measures, and to end mandatory alcohol treatment. The CLP says its temporary beat locations policy is working, but critics say it\u2019s too resource-heavy on police, and impossible to implement in places such as Darwin with multiple bottleshops.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/jul/22/northern-territory-political-parties-called-upon-to-address-justice-crisis-\">Making Justice Work campaign</a> said Labor and two independents, including Lawrie, were most aligned with their vision for reform.</p>",
  "<p>While he will not be fighting for the win at Spa on Sunday, the urge to do battle, it seems, has diminished not a jot for Jenson Button. All the drivers love to come to this classic track, nestling in the Ardennes mountains, and face down what is a turbulent test and thrill-ride combined, but for Button enthusiasm for the challenge here perhaps also stirred his feelings for the sport as a whole as he reaffirmed both his commitment to Formula One and his own talent in the face of continuing questions about his future in the sport.</p> <p>Strictly speaking, describing Button, who looks as youthful and fit as ever, as the grand old man of Formula One would be misleading. Kimi Raikkonen is the oldest driver on the grid, they are both 36, with the Finn three months older. But in terms of race starts the British driver is by some distance the most experienced in the field with 296 (third in the all-time list, behind Rubens Barrichello and Michael Schumacher) in the 16 years since he first took to the track with Williams in 2000 as Britain\u2019s youngest Formula One driver, aged 20. But rather than feeling those years, he exudes the air of a maturing fine wine in the paddock at Spa-Francorchamps.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/26/lewis-hamilton-belgian-grand-prix-grid-penalty\">Lewis Hamilton set to start from back of F1 grid at Belgian Grand Prix</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cI\u2019m probably driving the best I have in my career,\u201d he said. \u201cI put more and more pressure on myself every year.

Winning the world championship with Brawn was the highpoint in 2009 after which he switched to McLaren, where it was expected he would see out his career. For the past two seasons, however, his future has been hanging in the balance as contract renewals dragged on.</p> <p>It is a sequence that has continued into 2016 with September again the earliest the team have said any announcement will be made on whether he will be replaced.

Five points finishes have resulted, two more than his team-mate Fernando Alonso.</p> <p>He insists there are \u201cmultiple\u201d driver options for him still open within Formula One for next year and that he is happy his recent performances have been strong enough to prove his point to McLaren. They have, he believes, been drives born of his abiding enthusiasm for the sport.</p> <p>\u201cDo I enjoy my racing? Yes. My heart is definitely in racing now, 100%,\u201d he said. \u201cAt the last race I wouldn\u2019t have finished eighth if my heart wasn\u2019t in it.

  "<p>New records from the Stanford sexual assault trial show how former swimmer Brock Turner and his attorneys attempted to discredit the victim and argued that the attack on the unconscious woman constituted consensual sex.</p> <p>More than 1,000 pages of trial transcripts, obtained by the Guardian on Friday, offer a window into how the criminal justice system treats sexual assault survivors. </p> <p>The testimony of Turner and his supporters sheds new light on the \u201ctraumatizing\u201d process described by the victim in her <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jun/06/stanford-sexual-assault-case-victim-impact-statement-in-full\">emotional impact statement</a>, which launched a national <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jun/22/stanford-sexual-assault-bill-mandatory-prison-brock-turner\">debate about sexual violence</a>.</p> <p>The documents also reveal that Turner allegedly laughed at bystanders who intervened during the assault on the Stanford campus. Turner changed his story throughout the process and came to trial with a version of the events that contradicted his earlier statements and the testimony of witnesses and police.</p> <p>The 20-year-old was convicted of sexual assault with intent to rape an intoxicated woman and sexually penetrating an intoxicated and unconscious person with a foreign object. Two bystanders caught him \u201cthrusting\u201d on top of the motionless woman outside a fraternity house by a dumpster on 18 January 2015.</p> <p>The case sparked outrage in June when Turner was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jun/02/stanford-swimmer-sexual-assault-brock-allen-turner-palo-alto\">sentenced to six months in county jail</a> \u2013 significantly lighter than the minimum punishment of two years in state prison prescribed by law. Judge Aaron Persky is now facing a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jun/06/stanford-sexual-assault-judge-recall\">high-profile recall campaign</a> and on Thursday <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/aug/25/stanford-sexual-assault-case-aaron-persky-criminal-cases\">removed himself from all criminal cases</a> in the wake of intense scrutiny. </p> <h2>\u2018I tried to verbally ask, you know, Are you OK?\u2019</h2> <p>The court records include testimony from police officials and the two men who intervened, all of which establish that Turner had assaulted a woman, aged 22 at the time of the assault, who was visibly unconscious and who awoke hours later with no memory.</p> <p>Deputy Jeff Taylor said that when he approached the woman, \u201cI tried to verbally ask, you know, \u2018Are you OK? Can you hear me?\u2019 And I was getting no response. So I started doing it quite a bit louder, basically to the point of yelling at her to see if I could get any response whatsoever. And I didn\u2019t get anything.\u201d</p> <p>Peter Jonsson, one of two graduate students <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/jun/08/stanford-rape-brock-turner-witness-speaks-out-video\">hailed as a hero</a> for rescuing the victim, testified that \u201cshe looked asleep\u201d, according to the transcript. Turner tried to run away \u201cas fast as he could\u201d when they approached, Jonsson said.</p> <p>After they stopped Turner, Jonsson continued: \u201cI noticed that he was smiling. So I said, \u2018Why are you smiling? Stop smiling.\u2019 \u2026 I said, again, \u2018What are you doing?

And records show that Turner later claimed to police that he did not try and run away. But more than a year later, on 13 March 2016, Turner had a very different story in front of a jury, according to the court records.</p> <p>Questioned by prosecutor Alaleh Kianerci about Jonsson\u2019s claims that Turner smiled, the defendant said, \u201cI was laughing at the situation of how ridiculous it was.\u201d</p> <p>Turner further admitted that on the day of the assault, he lied to a detective when he said he didn\u2019t try and run. \u201cMy mind couldn\u2019t think clearly at the time.\u201d</p> <p>Turner also admitted under questioning that his testimony in court about why he and the victim ended up on the ground did not match his original comments to a detective. He had told the police official that he didn\u2019t remember why they were on the ground during the assault, but in court a year later, he had a detailed story about them playfully stumbling, the transcript shows.</p> <p>Questioned by his own attorney, Turner claimed that he met the victim at a party, they danced and kissed, he invited her back to his dorm, and they tripped and fell on the walk home.</p> <p>\u201cAfter you obtained her concurrence or permission to finger her, and you did finger her, what happened then?\u201d his lawyer Mike Armstrong asked.</p> <p>\u201cI fingered her for a minute. And I thought she had an orgasm. And then I \u2013 well, during that time, I asked her if she liked it, and she said, uh-huh,\u201d Turner replied.</p> <p>Kianerci, however, asked Turner why he had not told the detective any of those details after the assault. \u201cI was completely freaked out,\u201d Turner said.</p> <h2>One year later a new dialogue emerged</h2> <p>In her viral statement, the victim discussed the pain of hearing Turner\u2019s legal team craft a new narrative at trial. She <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jun/06/stanford-sexual-assault-case-victim-impact-statement-in-full\">wrote</a>: \u201cSo one year later, as predicted, a new dialogue emerged. </p> <p>\u201cBrock had a strange new story, almost sounded like a poorly written young adult novel with kissing and dancing and hand holding and lovingly tumbling onto the ground, and most importantly in this new story, there was suddenly consent. One year after the incident, he remembered, oh yeah, by the way she actually said yes, to everything, so.\u201d</p> <p>In his hearing, Turner further defended his choice to have sexual encounters with intoxicated women, the transcripts show. </p> <p>\u201cShe didn\u2019t appear any more drunk than anybody else I had been with,\u201d he told Kianerci.</p> <p>\u201cIs it normal for you to hook up with drunk girls?\u201d the prosecutor asked.</p> <p>\u201cAt a party, yes,\u201d Turner replied.</p> <p>Armstrong also brought in Kim Fromme, professor of clinical psychology at the University of Texas, Austin to strengthen his claims that the victim could have consented even if she was intoxicated.</p> <p>\u201cA blackout is a period of amnesia during drinking in which the person is fully conscious and aware to able [sic] to engage in all kinds of activities \u2013 walking, talking, driving a car, dancing, having sex, et cetera \u2013 they\u2019re just simply not forming memories for those events,\u201d Fromme said, according to the transcript. </p> <p>Survivors\u2019 advocates say that this line of argument is dangerous and perpetuates rape culture, since it allows perpetrators to discredit victims simply because they were intoxicated.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Brock Turner may not look like a typical rapist ... but he is the typical, quintessential face of campus sexual assault</p> <footer> <cite>Prosecutor Alaleh Kianerci</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>In his closing remarks, Armstrong cast blame on the victim, arguing she should have known better.</p> <p>\u201cShe\u2019s had more experience at college parties, maybe not fraternity parties but college parties, and she knows what it is to be in a blackout, because she\u2019s experienced it four or five times before,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cDid she intend for what happened to happen? Of course, I don\u2019t think she did. However, that doesn\u2019t mean that she was not aware and conscious and thinking clearly and taking voluntary actions when she was with Brock Turner.\u201d</p> <p>The transcripts also offer further details into how Turner\u2019s supporters came to his defense in court, echoing the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jun/07/stanford-sexual-assault-letters-brock-turner-judge\">controversial character letters</a> that were released in June and revealed that many blamed the victim for the attack.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t believe that he would do anything that would harm anybody. I think that Brock is very respectful and courteous,\u201d testified Gary Galbreath, a swimming coach from Brock Turner\u2019s home town of Ohio. </p> <p>\u201cThat would be the farthest type of behavior, the sexually aggressive or assaultive behavior that I would ever, ever, ever associate with Brock Turner,\u201d said Jennifer Jervis, Turner\u2019s former teacher.</p> <p>The prosecutor repeatedly noted that his supporters have no knowledge of how Turner behaves when he is intoxicated. And his accomplishments and privileged background should not sway the jury, Kianerci argued in her closing argument.</p> <p>\u201cBrock Turner may not look like a typical rapist. But the fact of the matter is, despite the fact that he comes from a good family, despite the fact that he went to an elite school, despite the fact that he was a star swimmer, he is the typical, quintessential face of campus sexual assault.\u201d</p> <p><em>Julia Carrie Wong contributed to this report</em></p>",
  "<p>Court documents ordered released by a judge in Oakland, California, have revealed rare insights into how local police and the FBI use a sophisticated surveillance device known as Stingray.<br></p> <p>Stingray, manufactured by the Delaware-based Harris Corporation, is one of a class of devices known as \u201ccell site simulators\u201d or \u201cIMSI-catchers\u201d. About the size of a suitcase, they work by pretending to be a cellphone tower in order to strip metadata and in some cases phone content and data from nearby devices tricked into connecting to it.</p> <p>Despite the fact that the devices are also capable of listening to phone calls, in many cases they still do not require a warrant to use, instead requiring a much lower-level authorisation known as a \u201ctrap-and-trace\u201d, a court order designed in the era of the rotary phone. </p> <p>However, following several years of reporting by the Guardian, Ars Technica, the Wall Street Journal and others, some states \u2013 including California \u2013 and some federal agencies now require a full warrant for their use.</p> <p>The Oakland documents, which were <a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2016/08/to-find-suspect-city-cops-ran-stingray-for-hours-then-called-in-fbi/\">first reported on by Ars Technica</a>, show that the city police department used its Stingray device for several hours in a search for a suspect named Purvis Ellis, the lead defendant of four alleged members of an Oakland gang facing trial on nine federal charges including the attempted murder of a police officer in January 2013.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/10/vancouver-police-confirm-stingray-surveillance-technology\">Vancouver police confirm use of 'stingray' surveillance technology</a> </p> </aside>  <p>After they failed to locate Ellis using their Stingray device, the Oakland police then asked the FBI for help, the documents reveal. The FBI \u2013 using their own Stingray and an \u201caugmentation device\u201d about which little is known \u2013 located Ellis and brought him into custody.</p> <p>Ars Technica speculates that this might have been because the Oakland police\u2019s Stingray was an older model that did not work with 4G phone networks. <a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2014/09/cities-scramble-to-upgrade-stingray-tracking-as-end-of-2g-network-looms/\">In 2014 it was reported</a> that Oakland was among the cities seeking funding to upgrade to the more sophisticated Hailstorm device, which is also made by Harris Corporation.</p> <p>The scale of the use of such devices by local and federal law enforcement agencies has only recently begun to emerge into the daylight. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/apr/10/stingray-spying-fbi-phone-dragnet-police\">A Guardian investigation in 2015</a> revealed the non-disclosure agreement that local police were forced to sign with the FBI before receiving permission to use Stingray \u2013 a document that mandated local prosecutors to abandon cases rather than risk information about Stingray becoming public.</p> <p>The past two years have seen a slow drip of information about the spread of Stingray and similar devices. <a href=\"https://www.aclu.org/map/stingray-tracking-devices-whos-got-them\">According to the American Civil Liberties Union</a> (ACLU), at least 66 state and federal agencies are now known to use the devices, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/oct/26/stingray-surveillance-technology-irs-cellphone-tower\">including the IRS</a>, as well as dozens of state and local police departments.</p> <p>The FBI\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3033550-225-1.html\">statement</a> in the Oakland case illustrates the lengths to which the agent goes to convince the judge that this type of surveillance is not overstepping the boundaries of privacy. The statement reads more like a press release than a legal declaration.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/mar/17/us-marshals-stingray-surveillance-airborne\">US Marshals spent $10m on equipment for warrantless Stingray surveillance</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The agent says that, as configured by the FBI, \u201cthe cell site simulator does not remotely capture emails, texts, contact lists, images or other data from the phone,\u201d a claim which is repeated almost in full two more times in the statement. </p> <p>The agent also goes out of his way to describe how the data collected with the device was purged after the subject was taken into custody, and the affidavit from Oakland\u2019s police department makes a similar claim.</p> <p>As privacy activists have pointed out, the Stingray device \u2013 as well as similar devices like the newer and more powerful Hailstorm or Boeing\u2019s DRTBox \u2013 are technically capable of accessing phone content and data; the judge, and the public, are effectively being asked to take the police and the FBI at their word that the devices are not being used in this way.</p> <p>In 2015, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/sep/04/baltimore-cases-overturned-police-secret-stingray-surveillance\">the Guardian reported</a> that up to 2,000 cases in Baltimore could be overturned after police were accused of \u201cdeliberate and willful misrepresentation\u201d of the evidence obtained using Stingray devices.</p> <p>The same year, Governor Jerry Brown of California signed a law which mandates that Stingray use requires a full search warrant, rather than a mere trap-and-trace order, to use. The federal departments of justice and homeland security have also updated their policy to require their officers to obtain a warrant in most \u2013 though not all \u2013 circumstances. </p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/house-bill/3871/all-actions-without-amendments\">Stingray Privacy Act</a>, proposed in 2015 by Representative Jason Chaffetz of Utah, would make all warrantless Stingray use illegal.

  "<p>The newest American Girl doll <strong> </strong>is a young, aspiring singer growing up in 1960s Detroit named Melody Ellison. The doll is one of two black characters currently available in the brand\u2019s BeForever collection and hit shelves Thursday. </p> <p>Nine-year-old Melody is described as a singer in her local church, with her backstory set against the civil rights movement and the rising popularity of Motown. \u201cAs Melody gains more awareness of racial inequality and her sense of community grows from her extended family to include her neighborhood and, ultimately, all African Americans, she is inspired by Dr King to have a dream of her own: to lift her voice for fairness and equality,\u201d the <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.americangirl.com/explore/articles/introducing-melody/\">American Girl website</a> states.</p> <p>The doll had a six-member advisory board to consult on her look and backstory, according to <a href=\"https://mic.com/articles/152686/melody-the-newest-american-girl-doll-is-a-black-girl-living-in-1963-detroit#.brbkErAMK\">Mic</a>, which included Julian Bond, the late civil rights activist.

Her outfit features a bright blue and green houndstooth dress with a matching blue headband and shoes. Her hair is straightened, a decision that was changed several times in the design process, Juanita Moore, president and CEO of the Charles H Wright Museum of African American History in Detroit, told <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation-now/2016/08/18/say-hello-detroits-american-girl-doll/88944296/\">USA Today</a>.</p> <p>\u201cIn the late 60s, the majority of African Americans did have straight hair,\u201d Moore said. \u201cIt may not have been bone straight, but it was straightened. In addition to our own recollections growing up as 60s girls, there also was historical research.\u201d</p> <p>The doll was first unveiled in February, during Black History Month. A special launch event was held on Saturday at the Detroit Public Library where 20 dolls were given away, the <a href=\"http://www.freep.com/story/news/2016/08/20/detroits-american-girl-doll-draws-hundreds-debut/89054648/?hootPostID=05ca4c772b353023c20efb27e37fcd3a\">Detroit Free Press</a> reported. American Girl donated $50,000 and 220 dolls to the library, as well as $100,000 worth of Melody-themed books \u2013 kids in attendance received two books which were signed by the author Denise Lewis Patrick, and other kids can pick up their free copies before the end of the year.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a Detroit theme, a 60s theme, Michigan, a little black doll, it\u2019s a blessing to be here, to see it,\u201d Valencia Muqaribu, a parent at the event, told the Free Press. Her daughter said the doll looked pretty.</p> <p>American Girl began in 1986 and was <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/1998/06/16/business/company-news-mattel-agrees-to-buy-maker-of-american-girl-dolls.html\">bought by Mattel</a> in 1998. Since, the brand has designed two other black dolls for its BeForever historical line. Addy Walker was the first, with a backstory of an escaped slave. Cecile Rey, an 1850s girl living in New Orleans, debuted in 2011, but was <a href=\"http://www.nbcnews.com/news/asian-america/american-girl-discontinues-its-only-asian-american-doll-n132266\">discontinued</a> in 2014 alongside Ivy Ling, the collection\u2019s only Asian American doll.

  "<p>For Victor Wanyama, it was a statement of respect and ambition. When the Kenya midfielder joined Celtic in 2011, he asked to be given the No67 shirt. It was a move that acknowledged the club\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/aug/23/hapoel-beer-sheva-celtic-champions-league-qualifier-match-report\">European Cup</a>-winning team of 1967, the fabled Lisbon Lions and, also, one that advertised his dream to emulate them.</p> <p>By any reckoning, it was a bold decision from an unheralded player who had arrived from Germinal Beerschot in Belgium for \u00a3900,000. Wanyama was 20 at the time. Was he setting himself up for a fall? \u201cI am somebody who is not afraid to try because I believe that failing is just when you are not willing to fight,\u201d he says. \u201cI was ready to fight. That\u2019s why I was not scared to take the shirt.\u201d</p> <p>Tottenham Hotspur\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/jun/23/tottenham-complete-signing-victor-wanyama-southampton\">\u00a311m summer signing from Southampton</a> speaks in soft tones as he outlines his hopes for the future which, once again, involve the Champions League.

He headed the opening goal and he remembers Rod Stewart, the singer and lifelong Celtic fan, blubbing uncontrollably in the stands. Wanyama won the league title in each of his two seasons at Celtic and after three positive years at Southampton \u2013 the first under Pochettino \u2013 he intends to kick on.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/aug/25/mauricio-pochettino-unimpressed-by-erik-lamela-showboating-against-palace\">Tottenham\u2019s Mauricio Pochettino takes dim view of Lamela\u2019s showboating</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The connection to Pochettino was one of the attractions of the move to Spurs and it says much for Wanyama\u2019s work ethic that he was prepared to sign up for another dose of the Argentinian\u2019s punishing pre-season training regimes.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s tough when you go through it but, afterwards, you can feel how important it is because when you go into games, you are so much fitter and you do more,\u201d Wanyama says. \u201cYou can see that it pays off. I know the manager from before; he signed me at Southampton [for \u00a312.5m]. He always focuses on the small details and that\u2019s what improves players.\u201d</p> <p>Wanyama talks a good deal about improvement, in a personal and collective sense, and his primary target for the season is to improve upon what Tottenham achieved last time out, which will not be straightforward but, according to him, is possible. He has started brightly and it was his goal that secured the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/aug/20/tottenham-hotspur-crystal-palace-premier-league-match-report\">1-0 home win over Crystal Palace</a> last Saturday. Then, there is the Champions League. Thursday\u2019s group-phase draw has made it feel real and there was excitement and optimism when the club <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/aug/25/champions-league-pep-guardiola-manchester-city-barcelona-leicester-city\">pulled CSKA Moscow, Bayer Leverkusen and Monaco</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8ec65872c205d1d56f21c2f71c1beda13ff3f886\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8ec65872c205d1d56f21c2f71c1beda13ff3f886/0_18_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Victor Wanyama rises above Jordi Alba of Barcelona to score for Celtic in the Champions League in November 2012.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Victor Wanyama rises above Jordi Alba of Barcelona to score for Celtic in the Champions League in November 2012.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jeff J Mitchell/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Wanyama is ready to fight. He always has been, since his formative days in Muthurwa, a neighbourhood in the Kenyan capital, Nairobi, which is the sort of place, Wanyama says, that stays with people. It was rough and, as a child, he saw terrible things.</p> <p>\u201cYou would be walking along or playing football and you would see thieves snatching things or someone taking a knife out to stab the other one because something had happened \u2013 he took his money, maybe. For a young kid, seeing what I saw was a bit of a torture, I would even say.\u201d</p> <p>Football was his salvation; his pathway to a \u201cbetter life\u201d. Wanyama dedicated himself to the game. At the age of 11, he played for a local team called Country Bus and, together with his team-mates, he would walk for miles in his bare feet to get to away fixtures. He cites the club\u2019s coach \u2013 a man known as Amigo, who has since died \u2013 as an inspiration.</p> <p>\u201cSometimes, we would walk really far, like, say, the distance between Tottenham\u2019s training ground in Enfield and White Hart Lane [seven miles],\u201d Wanyama says. \u201cAnd then we\u2019d have to walk back. It was a hell of a journey but, sometimes, it was fun, because you were in a big group and we were young. We would play against teams who might bring older boys but we were not scared.</p> <p>\u201cI was distracted by football, it was important for me because it passed my time and made sure that I did not get involved in other things. Amigo was really committed to helping the youth and he loved to train us, although we were playing with balls that were hand-made out of paper and elastic bands.\u201d</p> <p>Wanyama played barefoot and when he won his first pair of boots at an under-12 tournament, he found them so uncomfortable that he had to take them off. \u201cThe pitches were not great and you\u2019d hit your toe and there would be blood everywhere,\u201d he adds. \u201cBut you just continued. They were the surfaces we had at the time and it was fun.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"217432598b4ce16203347c13db67032cf8dc29ec\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/217432598b4ce16203347c13db67032cf8dc29ec/0_79_3756_2254/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Victor Wanyama celebrates after scoring the only goal of the game against Crystal Palace last weekend.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Victor Wanyama celebrates after scoring the only goal of the game against Crystal Palace last weekend.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Eddie Keogh/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Wanyama\u2019s parents worked for Kenya Railways and he describes his family as \u201cneither rich nor poor\u201d. He adds: \u201cWhere we lived was OK. My parents provided what they could but they could not buy football shoes for me. There was not any day where they wanted to see me go to sleep without eating. So I was getting food.\u201d</p> <p>Wanyama is not the only famous footballer in his family. His father, Noah, played for the AFC Leopards and won caps for Kenya while his older brother is McDonald Mariga, who has played for Parma and Internazionale, among others, and is now at Latina in Serie B.</p> <p>\u201cMcDonald\u2019s full name is McDonald Mariga Wanyama and I\u2019m Victor Mugubi Wanyama,\u201d Wanyama says. \u201cIn Kenya, the family name comes last and I like to use my family name on my jersey. McDonald has always had Mariga on his shirt. It\u2019s just a choice.\u201d</p> <p>Mariga has a Champions League winners\u2019 medal from his time at Inter \u2013 he was an unused substitute for Jos\u00e9 Mourinho\u2019s team in the 2010 final against Bayern Munich although he featured off the bench in the earlier knockout rounds, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2010/apr/28/barcelona-inter-live\">including the semi-final</a>, second leg at Barcelona.</p> <p>He was the family\u2019s trailblazer in Europe and when he was at Helsingborg in 2006-07, he persuaded the Swedish club to admit his brother to their academy. Wanyama was 14 when he arrived and having coped with the culture shock, he enjoyed an invaluable experience.</p> <p>\u201cIt was really strange, at first, because I didn\u2019t understand any Swedish but I enjoy languages and after three or four months, I was getting there with it,\u201d Wanyama says. \u201cHow is my Swedish now? Really bad. My Flemish is better, because I was at Germinal Beerschot for three years.</p> <p>\u201cHelsingborg really helped me. If I had stayed in Kenya, I wouldn\u2019t have got that experience of knowing how to be a pro. They didn\u2019t have the facilities in Kenya that I had in Sweden. I was really lucky to go there. I stayed with my brother and when he left for Parma in 2007, I went back to Kenya. I joined one of the academies called JMJ and after that I went to Belgium.\u201d</p> <p>Wanyama\u2019s interest in British football took hold at an early age. He would go to the cinema in Muthurwa to watch the big derbies, Glasgow, Manchester and north London, and his favourite players were Roy Keane, Paul Scholes and Robbie Keane.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"176aee300de684af2b919cc5e031db1b6ca24c49\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/176aee300de684af2b919cc5e031db1b6ca24c49/0_119_4523_2715/1000.jpg\" alt=\"undefined\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Spurs will be playing their Champions League home matches at Wembley this season, and the club is committed to engaging with the local community in Brent.

He pushed for the transfer to happen in the summer of 2015, only for Southampton to block it. There was frustration, a measure of ugliness. \u201cIt\u2019s always tough when somebody wants you and the other club makes it difficult,\u201d Wanyama says.

How could it be that in Cannes, of all places \u2013 on the very beach where in 1953 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/gallery/2014/sep/20/brigitte-bardot-her-life-and-times-so-far-in-pictures\" title=\"\">Brigitte Bardot</a> famously posed in a bikini \u2013 women could now be told what they can and can\u2019t wear?</p> <p>So much has been said about this political, social and moral mess that trying to make sense of it is to risk appearing complacent or in denial about France\u2019s republican or democratic flaws.

In a keenly awaited ruling, France\u2019s highest administrative court, the Conseil d\u2019Etat, today overturned the burkini ban because, the judges said, \u201cit represents a severe and manifestly illegal threat to fundamental freedoms that are the freedom of coming and going, freedom of conscience and personal freedom\u201d.</p> <p>The Conseil d\u2019Etat gave no credence&#xa0;whatsoever to claims that the burkini ban, as some of its defenders have claimed, was necessary to uphold&#xa0;<em>la\u00efcit\u00e9, </em>France\u2019s brand of secularism; nor was it a way of protecting \u201cpublic order\u201d. In a context&#xa0;where France is still officially in a state of emergency following the recent terror attacks in the country, this is significant.</p> <p>It took France a long time to find the right balance between respecting the Catholic traditions of many of its people and implementing its 1905 law of separation of church and state. In recent decades, what has been unfolding \u2013 and has now taken on an increasingly hysterical dimension \u2013 is a new quest for a democratic notion of inclusiveness within French society for Muslims, especially French-born youngsters who feel disenfranchised. None of this has been made easier by the fact that France still has to come to terms with its colonial past, and that terrorism has made toxic passions swirl.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The Conseil d\u2019\u00c9tat gave no credence to claims that the burkini ban was necessary to uphold France\u2019s brand of secularism</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>In 1909, the Conseil d\u2019Etat had to rule on an issue not altogether different from today\u2019s burkini question. The city of Sens had at the time outlawed religious processions and even the wearing of cassocks on its streets. Anti-clerical sentiment was so high that the very public appearance of religious clothing was itself deemed disruptive.</p> <p>But the judges struck down the ban with arguments that strikingly echo today\u2019s ruling. And they included a reminder that the 1905 law was about freedom of conscience just as much as it was about ensuring the \u201cneutrality\u201d of the republic in all things religious (the latter point being, by the way, the reason&#xa0;for the 2004 veil ban in French&#xa0;state schools).

Many people reading this will&#xa0;immediately jump: applied to beaches in Britain, does that mean a Sikh wearing a turban, or any other person carrying \u201cconspicuous\u201d religious&#xa0;clothing, would represent some sort of risk?</p> <p>However, it is possible that the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/19/nice-becomes-latest-french-city-to-impose-burkini-ban\" title=\"\">mayor of Nice</a> \u2013 a city still traumatised by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jul/15/nice-terror-attack-truck\" title=\"\">July\u2019s terror attack</a>, and where there have been signs of inter-ethnic tensions \u2013 may have had reasonable concerns that racist&#xa0;people might want to attack a woman wearing the burkini. Of course, the first thing to say about this is that upholding public order should be the responsibility of the police \u2013 not of women, who must be free to choose their clothes.</p> <p>But the reason the French prime minister, Manuel Valls, recently shifted from talking about the \u201censlavement\u201d of women (as a way of explaining his support for the ban) to mentioning \u201cpublic order\u201d is that this offered a potentially more solid basis for his views \u2013 which this week led to a show of divisions within the government. Now the highest court has clearly ruled that neither \u201cpublic order\u201d nor \u201cemotions linked to terrorist acts\u201d can be invoked to legitimise the ban.</p> <p>President Hollande has carefully stayed away from the arguments, no doubt waiting for the ruling. But that does little to hide the fact that France\u2019s&#xa0;second socialist president under the Fifth Republic has failed to genuinely reach out to Muslims, especially the young, to reassure them&#xa0;that they will be considered equal&#xa0;citizens, and need not feel overlooked. Again, there is historical precedent: in the 1980s, when the Front&#xa0;National first reared its head, Hollande\u2019s predecessor, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/nov/28/mitterrand-study-ambiguity-philip-short-review\" title=\"\">Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand</a>, also missed an opportunity to convey that sense of inclusiveness, despite many slogans heard at the time (such as <em>touche pas \u00e0 mon pote</em>, for those who remember).</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/24/france-burkini-ban-secularist-equality-muslim\">France\u2019s burkini ban exposes the hypocrisy of its secularist state | Iman Amrani</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The roots of France\u2019s republican model go back to the battle between church and state, and also to its colonial past.

It will hopefully restore common decency and the rule of law, and emphasise that the burkini does not in itself threaten public order.

  "<p>Not every big issue that Europe has faced over the past 12 months has been linked to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/migration\" title=\"\">migration and refugee crisis</a>. But most of them have. The arrival of over 1 million people in late summer 2015 shook European politics and institutions, as well as challenging Europe\u2019s awareness of itself and its place in the world more than any event since the fall of the Berlin Wall. It would be foolish to imagine that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/25/eu-and-turkey-restart-talks-over-migrant-pact\" title=\"\">this crisis is now over</a> and that the numbers will not rise again.</p> <p>One key moment came in late August 2015, when <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/germany-opens-its-gates-berlin-says-all-syrian-asylum-seekers-are-welcome-to-remain-as-britain-is-10470062.html\" title=\"\">Germany announced</a> it would accept all Syrian refugees fleeing war without sending them back to the countries where they had first entered the EU. Angela Merkel\u2019s words a few days later, <a href=\"http://www.faz.net/aktuell/politik/angela-merkels-sommerpressekonferenz-13778484.html\" title=\"\">\u201cWir schaffen das\u201d</a> (we will manage), felt pivotal, although whether the German chancellor really did open the floodgates of a vast refugee movement is still debated. Refugees had, after all, been on the move for months already in their hundreds of thousands. Harrowing pictures of overcrowded voyages to reach Europe were familiar. Long before Germany opened its doors, southern EU countries were facing a critical situation, their administrations and social services overwhelmed.</p> <p>Many, including the Guardian, applauded Mrs Merkel\u2019s humanitarian lead. Yet it cannot be disputed that in many ways Europe then failed the moral test. The worst refugee crisis in modern Europe has had a transformative effect that few had predicted or prepared for. The EU, Europe\u2019s nation states, and Europeans in general have all been weighed in the balance. On the political level the migration crisis has empowered nationalist and populist parties, which have since grown in influence from Austria to Scandinavia in ways that may last. Brexit might not have happened without the worries fed by Europe\u2019s refugee problem and their exploitation in Ukip\u2019s posters. Chaos and misery at borders, from Calais in the north to Kos and Lampedusa in the south, exposed the EU\u2019s divisions and inefficiency, energising centrifugal political pressures whose impact on the union may not end with Brexit.</p> <p>A key pillar of the EU project, the passport-free Schengen area created in 1995, remains in disarray. Schengen was suspended last February, and there is still no clarity as to how it might be restored. Across the continent, internal <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/national-borders-are-the-worst-invention-ever-says-ec-chief-jean-claude-juncker-a7204006.html\" title=\"\">border controls</a> that had once been abolished \u2013 and in some places, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/26/hungarys-pm-plans-more-massive-fence-to-keep-out-migrants\" title=\"\">barbed-wire fences</a> with police using tear gas against refugees \u2013 have become the new normal. These reflect not just a spike of illiberalism caused by reactions to the refugees but the EU\u2019s longterm failure to control its external borders effectively. Unless the external borders are controlled and managed, perhaps by the now strengthened EU border force, freedom of movement inside the bloc merely compounds the problems.</p> <p>A year ago Europeans finally grasped that their own world is not shielded from the chaos of the Middle East and of parts of Africa and Asia. In the aftermath, geopolitics have been upended. European relations with Turkey have been transformed in the effort to stem the arrival of refugees across the Aegean sea. Mrs Merkel has been much criticised, this time for her realpolitik rather than her humanity, but the deal has brought the numbers down (while displacing some of the pressure to the Libya-Italy crossing). There have been EU efforts to get sub-Saharan countries to take back migrants not entitled to asylum, in exchange for development aid, but such aid has been patchy at best. Though&#xa0;most victims of war and poverty have stayed in their regions, the exodus will not stop until those regions are helped to become safer and more prosperous.</p> <p>In spite of endless summitry and talks over refugee quotas, in which <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/aug/03/uk-unlikely-to-reach-target-of-resettling-20000-syrian-refugees-by-2020\" title=\"\">Britain played a strikingly minimal role</a>, Europe has shown itself mostly at a loss. In dealing with Turkey as it did, it has harmed some of its human rights principles. The onslaught of terrorism in France and elsewhere has fed paranoia about migrants. Identity politics is on the rise almost everywhere. Anti-Muslim movements, such as <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/a6bf467e-6852-11e6-ae5b-a7cc5dd5a28c.html#axzz4ISBDxnAQ\" title=\"\">the AfD in Germany</a>, have benefited. France remains convulsed by&#xa0;issues like the burkini, in spite of today\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/26/frances-highest-court-suspends-burkini-ban-in-test-case\" title=\"\">welcome court decision</a> suspending a local ban. On the other hand, there have also been&#xa0;the many gestures of solidarity and humanity. Citizens\u2019 networks&#xa0;have distributed food, clothes and offered housing. Volunteers have thrown themselves into support efforts on the beaches and in the camps. \u201cRefugees welcome\u201d slogans have been hoisted on homes, football stadiums, places of worship and even government buildings.</p> <p>In the year since <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/sep/02/shocking-image-of-drowned-syrian-boy-shows-tragic-plight-of-refugees\" title=\"\">Alan Kurdi\u2019s body</a> was found on a beach, Europeans have been found wanting. They have learned that what goes on in the rest of the world affects them more than they thought \u2013 a glumly late illumination after Europe has had so much impact on the world. Europeans have been confronted with the truth that theirs is one of the richest parts of the planet and that many desperate people, some fleeing for their lives, want to reach it. How Europe responds in the longer term remains in the balance. But the past year has been a humbling start.</p>",

Safety can come to be embedded in the culture of tourism or parkland recreation teams, for example,\u201d said Walker, \u201cBut in other areas it might just be a bolt on to another job, and as a result you get people who are either so pushed that they have two other things to do or they don\u2019t fully understand what they are doing. </p> <p>\u201cIn big areas like Devon and Cornwall you see the specialists, for example, but in some other areas there has been an erosion of knowledge.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/jun/10/accidental-drownings-uk-rnli-walkers-anglers-warned\">Walkers and anglers warned as drownings in UK waters hit new high</a> </p> </aside>  <p>For water sports enthusiasts and beach day-trippers alike, the Maritime &amp; Coastguard Agency statistics for deaths along Britain\u2019s coastline make for grim reading. In 2010, 32 people ranging from anglers to swimmers lost their lives. Both in 2013 and in 2014 more than 100 people died, and last year the figure was 67. This year\u2019s toll will include not just the five Camber Sands deaths but those of a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/aug/24/toddler-swept-out-to-sea-parents-cornwall-dies-mckayla-bruynius-newquay-beach-father-rudy\">two-year-old girl and her father</a> who were swept into the sea in Cornwall last week.</p> <p>The count rises sharply when water-related fatalities that have taken place inland are added.

  "<p>Colin O\u2019Brien, who has died aged 76, was a self-taught photographer; he was inspired by the work of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/gallery/2013/mar/24/bert-hardy-photographs-in-pictures\">Bert Hardy</a> and <a href=\"http://www.billbrandt.com/\">Bill Brandt</a>, which he saw as a child in <a href=\"http://www.gale.com/picture-post-historical-archive/\">Picture Post magazine</a>, to begin documenting everyday, working-class life in London in the 1950s. <a href=\"http://www.colinobrien.co.uk/\">His vast photographic archive</a> of around half a million negatives is a unique visual record of the changing nature of the capital over the past 60 years, the highlights of which were collected in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/jul/26/london-life-review-colin-obrien-photography\">the book London Life</a> (2015). He is also known for his series of images of Travellers\u2019 children, taken in the 1980s. \u201cI\u2019m fascinated by the ordinary,\u201d he said. \u201cFamous people and famous things just don\u2019t interest me.

In it, his two boyhood friends, <a href=\"http://spitalfieldslife.com/2011/05/30/colin-obrien-photographer/\">Raymond Scallionne and Razi Tuffano</a>, pose moodily, as instructed by him, against a parked car in Hatton Garden, Clerkenwell, central London. Soon afterwards, his uncle, Will, a cab driver, gave him a basic contact printing set that allowed him to develop his photographs without using a darkroom. As a boy, O\u2019Brien shot with a Brownie box camera on the bustling, working-class streets of Clerkenwell, his neighbourhood, which was then called \u201cLittle Italy\u201d because of the Italian immigrants who had settled there and opened cafes and food stores.</p> <p>From the start, he seemed to understand instinctively that his area, with all its everyday human dramas, reflected the energy of the surrounding city. He photographed his father, Edward, at the breakfast table before a shift at nearby Mount Pleasant post office, and his mother, Edith (nee Kelly), a housewife, making tea and shopping for hats, as well as neighbours and children as they went about their daily lives. One of his black and white photographs of a London skyline at night dominated by factory chimneys was used on the cover of the first edition of Alfie (1966), a novel by his friend Bill Naughton from his earlier play, which was <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0060086/?ref_=nm_ov_bio_lk2\">also made into two films</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"721f7f41dcf6308e30e025c8bc83d66ca0399622\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/721f7f41dcf6308e30e025c8bc83d66ca0399622/0_0_2736_3648/750.jpg\" alt=\"Colin O\u2019Brien on the balcony of the flat in Clerkenwell, which he moved into with his parents when it was built in 1966.\" width=\"750\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Colin O\u2019Brien on the balcony of the flat in Clerkenwell, which he moved into with his parents when it was built in 1966.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: The Gentle Author</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>As a teenager, O\u2019Brien was a resourceful and imaginative photographer, shooting an extended series of images from the family\u2019s top-floor flat in Clerkenwell, which he later called \u201cmy first window on the world\u201d. From there, he photographed people passing by on the street below as well as Roman Catholic religious processions and even the aftermath of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/jul/26/london-life-review-colin-obrien-photography\">car accidents</a>. His images show the streets in bright summer sun and covered in winter snow. He often shot late into the night, capturing lone stragglers making their way home past hoardings advertising Guinness and Batchelors Peas.</p> <p>Inevitably, his wanderings took him further afield to Soho and the West End, where he often photographed at night, using a 1931 Leica purchased by his parents from a chauffeur, who claimed to have found it in the back of his car. In the 60s he also hung around outside football grounds, intent on capturing the faces of supporters pouring into the terraces or perching on walls and railings rather than the drama on the pitch. His snatched portrait of West Ham and England star <a href=\"http://unitg.london/gallery/product/bobby-moore-at-fulham-football-club-1975/\">Bobby Moore</a> is memorable for the crowd of children that surrounds him, each intent on their autographs. It captures a moment when English football began to shed its working-class roots for the glamour and riches of today\u2019s global, corporate game.</p> <p>In 1987, O\u2019Brien spent time among a community of <a href=\"http://www.spitalfieldslife.bigcartel.com/product/travellers-children-in-london-fields-by-colin-o-brien/\">Travellers in London Fields</a>, creating a gritty series that was later published as a book to critical acclaim. \u201cThose kids were so free,\u201d he said later. \u201cThey were impoverished but not unhappy. I think they\u2019re tender shots and there\u2019s a real sense of togetherness in some.\u201d</p> <p>The London that O\u2019Brien captured in the 1950s and 60s already looks impossibly distant in its mix of street traders, factory workers and scruffy children in short trousers and hand-knitted jumpers. The old-fashioned family shops have now been replaced by chains and purveyors of artisan goods. In the retrospective of his work, <a href=\"http://spitalfieldslife.bigcartel.com/product/london-life-by-colin-o-brien-published-by-spitalfields-life-books-on-june-18th\">London Life</a>, the photographs taken in the 80s and 90s chronicle the beginning of the hyper-gentrification of the capital that has rendered swaths of O\u2019Brien\u2019s East End virtually unrecognisable.</p> <p>Born and raised in Clerkenwell, O\u2019Brien rarely moved further afield than Hackney, in east London, where he settled in the 80s. His mother even brought Colin, an only child, back from evacuation in Cornwall during the Blitz, as she hated it so much, saying she\u2019d \u201crather take a chance\u201d. \u201cI wasn\u2019t Don McCullin going off to war or David Bailey photographing celebrities,\u201d <a href=\"http://www.islingtonfacesblog.com/2015/12/02/colin-obrien-photographer/\">O\u2019Brien said</a>. \u201cI was quite provincial.

He funded his street photography with various office jobs and by working as a technician at St Martin\u2019s School of Art, before he began teaching at the London Institute (now University of the Arts London). In the 70s he took photographs of plays and actors, including John Hurt and Steven Berkoff, at the King\u2019s Head theatre, Islington; the <a href=\"http://www.bishopsgate.org.uk/content.aspx?CategoryID=1865\">Bishopsgate Institute recently restored thousands of those images</a>.

Lancashire are having a rather sombre looking team meeting, while Surrey whoop and holler their way through their customary game of football. Batty scored a goal and went completely nuts a minute ago, and it\u2019s the usual suspects - Footitt and Davies - in goal. They both bring goalie gloves and everything. Hilarious people. </p> <p>Anyway, I suspect there\u2019s not *that* much life left in this game. They almost took the extra half-hour last night, and it may not take much longer than that for Surrey are to get their fourth win in seven games. They\u2019ve played really well. Lancashire\u2019s tail will look to doggedly resist for as long as possible. Who knows, eh?</p> <p>Elsewhere, there are seven games left. <strong>Yorkshire</strong> should clean up <strong>Notts</strong> at Scarborough, where my sources tell me the weather is great. <strong>Somerset</strong> are in control against <strong>Hampshire</strong> - but is there enough time to force a win? And <strong>Warwickshire</strong> will try to engineer a winning position against <strong>Durham</strong>. Again, who knows.</p> <p><strong>Essex</strong>, having beaten <strong>Leicestershire</strong> in three days, are well in charge of Div Two. The chasing pack is now led by <strong>Kent</strong>, who should finish off <strong>Gloucestershire</strong>, but a major contrivance would be required in Cardiff for <strong>Sussex</strong> to keep their hopes alive with victory over <strong>Glamorgan</strong>. <strong>Northants</strong>\u2019 game against <strong>Worcestershire</strong> is also looking very draw-shaped. </p> <p>Anyway, I\u2019ll try to stick some highlights up again in a min. All the usuals: lots of comments, play nicely, and <strong><em>enjoy the cricket</em></strong>.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57c006eee4b0486629890454\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-08-26T09:09:41.615Z\">10.09am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Morning all, </p> <p>We\u2019re back at the Oval with Will today.

He founded the alt-right American Renaissance website 25 years ago, which started as a print monthly to emphasize race as society\u2019s most \u201cprominent and divisive\u201d fault line, and that mainstream politics and media tries to \u201cgloss over\u201d the issue. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/23/alt-right-movement-white-identity-breitbart-donald-trump\">\u2018A sense that white identity is under attack\u2019: making sense of the alt-right</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Clinton has attacked Trump\u2019s associations with the alt-right, describing it as a \u201ca fringe element that has taken over the Republican party\u201d. </p> <p>Taylor said her speech was \u201ca typical lefty campaign ploy\u201d, and maintained Trump is not a part of the movement. \u201cIs Hillary Clinton responsible for the views of everyone who supports her?\u201d he asked. </p> <p>Asked to define what the diffuse alt-right stands for, Taylor said there were \u201careas of disagreement\u201d, but that \u201cthe central element of the alt-right is the position it takes on race.\u201d<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>That position, until recently, would have been clearly beyond the pale of presidential politics, and rejected by liberals and mainstream conservatives alike. Now, Taylor sees an opportunity to further proselytise his views. He does not think Trump is solely responsible for the alleged growth of the alt-right. But, \u201cit is encouraging because here we have a candidate for president who is saying some things that we have been saying for years\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"clinton campaign ad\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Why do so many Ku Klux Klan members support Trump?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;A lot of what he believes, we believe in.&amp;quot; &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/AqB3DLKL9f&quot;&gt;https://t.co/AqB3DLKL9f&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/HillaryClinton/status/768864106656956420&quot;&gt;August 25, 2016&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;script async src=&quot;//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>Principally, their common ground with Trump is on immigration policy \u2013 deportations, the repeal of birthright citizenship and Trump raising the \u201cquestion of why we need more Muslims in this country\u201d.</p> <p>For Taylor, and other members of the alt-right, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/23/alt-right-movement-white-identity-breitbart-donald-trump\">race is an inescapable biological fact</a>, which has consequences. \u201cThe races are not equal and equivalent. If a nation changes demographically, its society will change,\u201d he said.</p> <p>In her speech, Clinton cited the US Olympic team as an example of strength in diversity. Taylor uses it as an example of the different capacities and abilities of races. He argues that while black people are good athletes, whites and Asians have higher IQs, offering a form of the \u201cscientific racism\u201d that was widely discredited, and <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.honestthinking.org/en/unesco/UNESCO.1950.Statement/_on/_Race.htm\">denounced by the UN</a> after the second world war.</p> <p>\u201cRaces are different. Some races are better at some things than others\u201d, he said. <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Taylor also sees the racial separatism he strives for as a matter of \u201cfreedom of association\u201d, and denies that the alt-right is a hate movement, as Clinton has claimed. </p> <p>\u201cIf a white person says, \u2018I like being white, and I prefer my associates to be white\u2019, that\u2019s hate? Why?\u201d he said. \u201cIt should not be taboo to talk about these things.\u201d</p> <p>Political scientist George Hawley, who authored a book on the crisis of mainstream conservatism in the face of the challenge of the far right, said that until recently, mainstream conservatives were partly responsible for enforcing whatever taboos existed on this kind of open racial language and thinking. </p> <p>\u201cThe mainstream conservative movement has never wanted any kind of formal relationship with Taylor or his organisation. In fact, an association with American Renaissance could be damaging to a conservative\u2019s career.\u201d</p> <p>This enmity is mutual. Taylor said: \u201cMainstream conservatives have completely conceded the question of race, at the cost of their own political fortunes.\u201d </p> <p>Taylor has been a presence on the racially motivated fringes of the right for more than a quarter of a century, following the founding of his New Century Foundation in 1990, and American Renaissance in 1991. In articles \u2013 many written by Taylor \u2013 at events and in podcasts, the website stresses white people are discriminated against, black people are inclined to crime and mainstream conservatives who deny these assertions this are culpable and headed for disaster. </p> <p>According to the Southern Poverty Law Center, Taylor\u2019s career has involved lending a <a href=\"https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/extremist-files/individual/jared-taylor\">\u201cpseudo-academic polish\u201d</a> to racial thought. He presents as urbane: he is a trilingual Yale graduate, and his work has mainly involved producing \u201cresearch\u201d that backs up his positions on race. </p> <p>His influence can be seen in the alt-right Twitter accounts that brandish IQ tables and selective crime statistics to bolster their arguments on race. </p> <p> He has not only adopted the alt-right tag, first coined by white nationalist Richard Spencer, but also their online methods. In addition to the website, he is active on Twitter, and acts as a moderator on alt-right subreddits.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Chip Berlet, a veteran researcher of the far right, finds the mainstreaming of Taylor\u2019s views concerning, even if Trump loses the election. </p> <p>\u201cThe problem is not that they will take state power, because they almost never do. The problem is that in the course of this social movement, in action and propaganda, they target scapegoated groups of people who become victims of violence,\u201d said Berlet.</p> <p>While the Republican presidential nominee has apparently <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/24/donald-trump-immigration-reform-sean-hannity-fox-news\">softened his stance on immigration</a> as of this week, Taylor said, \u201cMr Trump speaks in elliptical phrases that sometimes make it hard to pin him down. At this point all talk about \u2018softening\u2019 seems to be speculation. I will wait until he gives that postponed speech on immigration policy.\u201d </p> <p>Berlet, too, is unconvinced and called it an insincere pivot to recover lost ground. But even if it were, it could not remedy Trump\u2019s actions in helping bring figures like Taylor to prominence.</p> <p>\u201cHe can\u2019t undo the damage he\u2019s done. The antagonisms he\u2019s bred will be longstanding, and will be apparent well beyond the election,\u201d said Berlet. <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p>",
  "<p>Joanna Moorhead\u2019s interview with the barrister David Wolfe (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/aug/13/my-activist-father-was-hanged\" title=\"\">My activist father was hanged</a>, 13 August) makes moving reading, and provides valuable background to the TV documentary The&#xa0;Good Terrorist, to be shown on Channel 4 on 27 August. But Mr Wolfe gets several facts wrong, and ends with an extraordinary judgment.</p> <p>I was a close friend of Mr Wolfe\u2019s anti-apartheid activist father John Harris; was among those detained by the security police after the lethal bomb blast in Johannesburg station in July 1964; and was held in a cell very near to Harris\u2019s for a month. After my release I attended every day of his trial; and after his conviction visited him regularly in prison until the morning before his execution. May I , from direct experience and records kept at the time, offer these comments?</p> <p>Mr Wolfe claims that his father was hanged \u201cfor a crime against apartheid\u201d. He was not. He was hanged for a crime against an elderly lady \u2013 murder \u2013 which he admitted, to which his counsel offered the defence that a mental disease had rendered him unable to distinguish between right and wrong.</p> <p>This claim was rejected by the trial judge and by the subsequent court of appeal, and correctly so \u2013 it was, as all of Harris\u2019s friends and family privately knew, a desperate fiction to save his life. David Wolfe ends by stating that his activist father \u2013 whose home-made bomb badly maimed 23 innocent civilians and killed one \u2013 had done \u201cthe right&#xa0;thing\u201d. Was he misquoted by Joanna Moorhead?

Oh, hang on, as you were, nothing\u2019s imminent.\u201d In other words, the dollar rose and then the dollar fell. Stocks trimmed gains and then recovered.</p> <p>Hunter at Capital Economics says Yellen\u2019s acknowledgement that \u201cthe case for an increase in the federal funds rate has strengthened\u201d would appear to increase the likelihood of a near-term rate hike. </p> <p>He continues:</p> <p>\u201cOn balance, however, we think most officials will want to see more concrete evidence of a rebound in GDP growth and a rise in inflation towards the 2% target, with a December move still appearing the most likely outcome.</p> <p>\u201cIn a fairly upbeat assessment of current economic conditions, Yellen acknowledged the recent strength of consumption, despite the weakness of GDP growth. She also highlighted that even that subdued pace of growth \u201chas been sufficient to generate further improvement in the labour market\u201d. However, she repeated the warning that the future path of monetary policy will depend on the incoming data.\u201d</p> <p>And on the consultancy\u2019s view on when rates will rise, Hunter concludes: </p> <p>\u201cOverall, along with the more upbeat tone of the recent data, we think the odds of a September rate hike have probably increased. They will increase further if we are right in forecasting that non-farm payrolls increased by a solid 180,000 in August (data due next Friday). Nonetheless, with real GDP expanding by just 1.2% over the past 12 months and inflation continuing to run below target, we still think most Fed officials will want to wait until December before next raising rates.\u201d</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57c057c7e4b0396caaf99785\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-08-26T14:59:19.380Z\">3.59pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here are some reassuring words for any readers struggling to make sense of today\u2019s Jackson Hole speech from Janet Yellen.</p> <p>Our economics editor, Larry Elliott, says the Fed Chair\u2019s address provided an opportunity for \u201cWall Street to play one of its favourite games: interpreting a speech by Janet Yellen.\u201d</p> <p>He writes:</p> <p>\u201cTruly, in terms of making her pronouncements cryptic, the most powerful central banker in the world is the daughter and heir to her predecessor but one, Alan Greenspan.</p> <p>Nothing Yellen has come up with comes close yet to Greenspan\u2019s \u201cI know you think you understand what you thought I said but I\u2019m not sure you realise that what you heard is not what I meant\u201d but <a href=\"http://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/yellen20160826a.htm\">her presentation at the Jackson Hole symposium</a> was a pretty good effort.\u201d</p> <p><em>Full analysis following soon</em></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57c05621e4b09fcabd06c924\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-08-26T14:49:35.448Z\">3.49pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Rob Carnell, chief international economist at the bank ING says it was a speech full of caveats from Janet Yellen and that \u201ca September rate hike remains awkward to sell to markets unless the inflation data start to move higher\u201d.</p> <p>He has pulled out two main messages, and one sub-message, from the lengthy Jackson Hole speech.</p> <p>\u201cThe first of the main messages was that <strong>the economy has continued to improve and that made the case for a rate hike more likely in the months ahead</strong>. </p> <p>\u201cBut \u201cmore likely\u201d does not mean \u201clikely\u201d, and markets are still reluctant to buy into a September rate hike story, at least without more information on the evolution of jobs growth, the pace of economic activity, or higher inflation.</p> <p>\u201cThe second message, which we suspect markets may also have problems accepting at face value, is that <strong>in the event of a return to crisis, more quantitative easing, coupled with \u201cforward guidance\u201d would likely provide sufficient stimulus to avert catastrophe</strong> (our words). This message might very well be filed under the heading of \u201cWell, they would say that wouldn\u2019t they.\u201d </p> <p>\u201cBut buried at the end of the speech, after a section that seemed to draw heavily on the recent paper by the San Francisco Fed President, John Williams\u2019, <strong>Yellen proposed an enhanced role for fiscal policy</strong>. She talked about the need for measures designed to improve productivity (fiscal, not monetary), as well as enhancing (fiscal) automatic stabilisers. A cynic might paraphrase the speech as \u201cThings are looking brighter, but if it all goes wrong don\u2019t panic, there\u2019s always fiscal policy\u201d.\u201d</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57c054b9e4b09fcabd06c91d\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-08-26T14:42:57.165Z\">3.42pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>David Morrison, senior market strategist at Spreadco has been looking at that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/aug/26/all-eyes-on-yellen-as-jackson-hole-kicks-off-business-live?page=with:block-57c05109e4b09fcabd06c908#block-57c05109e4b09fcabd06c908\">rollercoaster market reaction</a> to the speech by Janet Yellen.<br></p> <p>He comments:</p> <p>\u201cHer speech was undeniably hawkish.

As traders scanned below the headlines for the meat in the speech, perceptions over Dr Yellen\u2019s thinking changed. Gold and silver have surged as the dollar slumped.

New policy tools, which helped the Federal Reserve respond to the financial crisis and Great Recession, are likely to remain useful in dealing with future downturns. Additional tools may be needed and will be the subject of research and debate. But even if average interest rates remain lower than in the past, I believe that monetary policy will, under most conditions, be able to respond effectively.\u201d</p> </blockquote> <p>There are echoes of Bank of England governor Mark Carney, who <a href=\"http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/Documents/speeches/2016/speech915.pdf\">shortly after the EU referendum said</a>: \u201cThe charge that central banks are out of monetary ammunition is wrong, but the widespread absence of global price pressures demands that our firepower be well aimed.\u201d</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57c05244e4b09fcabd06c911\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-08-26T14:30:20.880Z\">3.30pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Also reacting to Janet Yellen\u2019s speech at Jackson Hole, Lee Ferridge, head of multi-asset strategy at State Street Global Markets North America has shared this view:</p> <p>\u201cDespite recent hints of an ongoing policy rethink at the FOMC [Federal Open Markets Committee], Janet Yellen\u2019s Jackson Hole speech did not break much new ground. Her comments could help arrest the dollar\u2019s recent decline and deal a blow to the rally in risky assets that we have seen in recent weeks.

Similarly, stock markets initially trimmed gains on the prospect of higher interest rates and then rose again when traders had digested Yellen\u2019s remarks and decided it was too soon to worry. </p> <p><strong>Aberdeen Asset Management fixed income investment manager James Athey comments:</strong><br></p> <p> \u201cWhile the bulk of Yellen\u2019s opening remarks at Jackson Hole focussed on monetary policy over the long term, she stated that in her opinion the case for a rate hike has strengthened in recent months. But the lack of any specific signal with regards to the September meeting means markets are unlikely to react adversely to this fairly throwaway comment. Yellen\u2019s comments were largely focussed on the debate around the effectiveness of the Fed\u2019s toolkit.</p> <p>\u201cOf course she defended the success of previous policy and indeed the ability of the Fed to respond effectively in the future, however she wasn\u2019t shy of highlighting the need for government to assist in the heavy lifting through the use of supportive fiscal policy \u2013 a plea we regularly hear from ECB President Mario Draghi.<br></p> <p>\u201cHowever the elephant in the room is that the Fed may well be worshipping at a false idol. There\u2019s more and more evidence to show that inflation just isn\u2019t behaving in the way that economists think it should. The Fed should stop targeting consumer inflation and start looking at a wider suite of measures to judge the health of the economy and the appropriateness of their policy. Sadly it looks like the wide open plains of Wyoming have not inspired any soul searching.\u201d</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57c04d6ce4b0486629890578\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-08-26T14:17:03.350Z\">3.17pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>So it\u2019s a hawkish message from Yellen, but is she telling us anything we didn\u2019t know already?</p> <p>Well, markets appear to be struggling to make sense of the message from Yellen.

  "<p>British politicians helped fuel a steep rise in racist hate crimes during and after the EU referendum campaign, a UN body has said.<br></p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.ohchr.org/EN/HRBodies/CERD/Pages/CERDIndex.aspx\">committee on the elimination of racial discrimination</a> said many prominent politicians should share the blame for the outbreak of xenophobia and intimidation against ethnic minorities.</p> <p>It said it was deeply concerned that the referendum campaign was marked by divisive, anti-immigrant and xenophobic rhetoric.</p> <p>\u201cMany politicians and prominent political figures not only failed to condemn it but also created and entrenched prejudices, thereby emboldening individuals to carry out acts of intimidation and hate towards ethnic or ethno-religious minority communities and people who are visibly different.\u201d</p> <p>More than <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/jul/11/police-blame-worst-rise-in-recorded-hate-on-eu-referendum\">3,000 allegations of hate crimes </a>were made to UK police \u2013 mainly in the form of harassment and threats \u2013 in the week before and the week after the 23 June vote, a year-on-year increase of 42%. </p> <p>The UN committee said it was concerned that the increase in hate crime notifications did not reflect the true extent of the problem, and that proportionately few reported cases resulted in successful prosecution. \u201cAs a result, a large number of racist hate crimes go unpunished.\u201d</p> <p>The committee did not name any politicians. However, the referendum campaign threw up allegations of racism against the prominent leave campaigner and former Ukip leader Nigel Farage, whose <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/16/nigel-farage-defends-ukip-breaking-point-poster-queue-of-migrants\">notorious anti-migrant \u201cBreaking Point\u201d poster</a> was reported to the police for inciting racial hatred.</p> <p>The UK government said in response to the committee that it had a \u201czero tolerance\u201d approach to hate crime. \u201cWe have in place one of the strongest legislative frameworks in the world to protect communities from hostility, violence and bigotry. We keep it under review to ensure it remains effective and appropriate \u2013 and recently published a comprehensive new <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/hate-crime-action-plan-2016\">hate crime action plan</a> to drive forward the fight.\u201d</p> <p>The committee added that the negative portrayal of minorities, immigrants, refugees and asylum seekers by the UK media, particularly in the aftermath of terrorist attacks, was also a concern.</p> <p>It called on the British government to investigate all reported acts of racist hate crime and ensure that perpetrators received appropriate legal sanctions. Ministers should also adopt comprehensive measures to combat racist hate speech and \u201cxenophobic political discourse\u201d on the internet.</p> <p>The government\u2019s anti-terrorism <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/97976/prevent-strategy-review.pdf\">Prevent strategy</a> had created \u201can atmosphere of suspicion towards members of Muslim communities\u201d, the committee said. Ministers should introduce safeguards to ensure the strategy did not discriminate on grounds of race, colour or ethnic origin.</p> <p>It warned that government proposals to scrap the Human Rights Act and replace it with a new British bill of rights could lead to \u201cdecreased levels of human rights protection\u201d in the UK.</p> <p>The chair of the Equality and Human Rights Commission, David Isaac, said: \u201cThere is no place for racism and hatred in a modern Britain and we share the UN\u2019s serious concerns about the recent spike in race-hate incidents. </p> <p>\u201cIn the weeks before and after the Brexit vote we saw reports of race-hate incidents rise significantly. We support the UN\u2019s recommendations for effective investigation and prosecution of all acts of racist hate crime and wide-ranging action better to deter and punish perpetrators.\u201d</p> <p>Dr Omar Khan, director of the Runnymede Trust, said the committee findings shamed Britain: \u201cThis report will embarrass the UK on the world stage and restrict the UK\u2019s ability to criticise other nations on human rights unless the government takes urgent action.\u201d</p> <p>The committee\u2019s conclusions, published on Friday, followed a series of hearings that took evidence from the UK government and charities and human rights agencies. It assesses all nations on a rolling four-year basis. The last UK report, in 2011, was critical of government inaction on tackling race inequality. </p> <p>The committee was established by a UN treaty, the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, to which Britain is a signatory. The convention is not incorporated into UK domestic law, meaning the government is not bound by the committee\u2019s recommendations.</p> <ul> <li>This article was amended on 26 August 2016.

This young poet from the suburbs of Toronto has fashioned a career out of forcing herself into places where she\u2019s least expected; whether it\u2019s the New York Times bestseller list or challenging social media to rethink how it sees menstruation.</p> <p>It was the latter that catapulted Kaur into headlines in 2015. After Instagram banned a photo, published as part of a university assignment, showing Kaur lying in bed with her pyjamas and sheets stained with a small amount of menstrual blood, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/mar/30/social-media-protecting-men-periods-breast-milk-body-hair\">Kaur fought back.</a> She pointed out the hypocrisy of being censored by a site that readily publishes photos of underage girls who are \u201cobjectified\u201d and \u201cpornified\u201d. Followers flocked to her, cheering her on as she added, \u201cI will not apologise for not feeding the ego and pride of misogynist society that will have my body in underwear but not be okay with a small leak.\u201d</p> <p>Instagram backed down. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/mar/30/social-media-protecting-men-periods-breast-milk-body-hair\">Insults and death threats were launched at Kaur</a>, but her followers on Instagram grew seven times over. A spoken word artist who had been told at times that she was too aggressive for certain venues or made some people uncomfortable, Kaur wondered if her hundreds of thousands of followers would all stick around for what was coming next.</p> <p>She began releasing short poems to her followers \u2013 simple, raw lines that tackled tough topics such as rape, domestic violence and alcoholism. \u201cThat was really scary,\u201d she says over coffee one sunny afternoon in Toronto. \u201cBut they did. They stayed for the poetry and that was such a beautiful gift in disguise.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PA0v9ANTrY\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/9PA0v9ANTrY?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>In 2014 she self-published a collection of her poetry, accompanied by her own sketches, titled <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/childrens-books-site/2016/jun/23/four-reasons-to-fall-in-love-with-poetry\">Milk and Honey</a>. It was a bold move, one made amid warnings that self-publishing would bar her from prestigious literary circles.</p> <p>But the traditional path of submitting her work to anthologies, magazines and journals was yielding little success. \u201cThere was no market for poetry about trauma, abuse, loss, love and healing through the lens of a Punjabi-Sikh immigrant woman,\u201d she says. </p> <p>The book was re-released in October 2015. The book climbed bestseller lists, earning Kaur an audience far beyond those she had captured through social media. \u201cWhich is so weird,\u201d she says. \u201cHow does a 50-year-old white woman relate to this?\u201d </p> <p>The reach of her writing hit her at a reading in San Francisco last year. As she neared the bookstore she saw a long line that snaked down four blocks and realised the crowd was there to see her. \u201cThat was the moment that I was like wow, this is crazy. It\u2019s going to be crazy. It\u2019s been that way since, which is really cool.\u201d </p> <p>No longer did it feel like she was casting her poetry into the vast online world and waiting to see if anyone would notice. Now it felt like the world was watching as Kaur, the child of Indian immigrants to Canada, sought to find her place using an unconventional recipe of poetry and social media.</p> <p>Part of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/nov/23/instapoets-instagram-twitter-poetry-lang-leav-rupi-kaur-tyler-knott-gregson\">a generation of poets dubbed Instapoets for their online reach,</a> Kaur struggled to strike a balance between the side of social media that had nursed her unlikely career \u2013 \u201c10 years ago, who was going to embrace the story of a young brown woman?\u201d \u2013 and the other, darker side of social media where insults and threats are hurled freely. While she tries to stay accessible to what she calls her grassroots community, she stays off social media for the most part. \u201cIt\u2019s hard because I feel like it\u2019s such a big stage for my work,\u201d she says.</p> <p>Another tension lies in the norms impressed upon her during her strict upbringing in a tight-knit Punjabi-Sikh community. \u201cFor South Asian women, you\u2019re supposed to be quiet and not have those opinions.\u201d When she began publicly addressing topics like rape, menstruation and domestic abuse, her parents would wonder what her hypothetical mother-in-law might think one day. \u201cAnd I would be like, then why did you teach me to say things out loud?\u201d</p> <p>Since the release of her book, her family has rallied around her, supporting her work. But she\u2019s often reminded of the limits she\u2019s railing against when she performs in Brampton, the suburban city on the outskirts of Toronto where she grew up and where the South Asian population now outnumbers all other groups. \u201cI thought that I would go to Brampton and do readings there and it would be filled with Punjabi people. It\u2019s not,\u201d she says. \u201cThey\u2019re very timid. I think poetry and this form of expression is still kind of new and there\u2019s a lot of hiding happening.\u201d</p> <p>But there are moments during those shows that validate Kaur\u2019s drive to constantly force her way past boundaries. \u201cWhen you see someone who looks like your mom there and she\u2019s like \u2018this puts so much of my pain into something concrete that I can hold,\u2019\u201d she says. \u201cThat\u2019s when I\u2019m like okay, I\u2019m doing something right and I just want to keep doing it.\u201d</p>",

  "<p>Attempts to provide poor, pregnant women in Texas with mosquito repellent to avoid possible Zika infections are off to a slow start.<br></p> <p>Two weeks after the state announced that mosquito repellent would be given out to women and girls on Medicaid, only 1,200 cans have been distributed, equivalent to less than 1% of the roughly 134,000 pregnant women eligible for the product. Only 25 cans of mosquito repellent have been given out to the roughly 92,000 women who qualify for family planning services through the state.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/17/zika-virus-outbreaks-us-testing-difficulties-mosquitoes\">'Nobody's looking': why US Zika outbreak could be bigger than we know</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Texas is one of the most vulnerable states to a Zika outbreak. Cities on the gulf coast provide an ideal environment for <em tabindex=\"-1\">Aedes aegypti</em> mosquitoes, the virus\u2019s vector, and the state has already seen 108 travel-related cases of Zika, including <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://bigstory.ap.org/article/d41731d8f23f4803b04ddaaba25b54b8/texas-residents-zika-case-linked-miami-travel\">one related to an outbreak in Miami</a>.</p> <p>\u201cThe provision of mosquito repellent through these programs is definitely a step in the right direction, and this is something the coalition advocated for,\u201d said Alice Bufkin, policy director for the Texas Women\u2019s Healthcare Coalition. \u201cAbsolutely, this is not enough, of course, but it is important that [the state] did it, and now it\u2019s important to figure out.\u201d </p> <p>In Texas, girls and women aged 10 to 45 on Medicaid and other public health programs can obtain mosquito repellent through a pharmacy. The state issued what\u2019s called a \u201cstanding order\u201d in an attempt to make it unnecessary for women to obtain a prescription to get the repellent. </p> <p>But pharmacies have to opt in to this program, meaning many still legally require prescriptions, including some major chains. </p> <p>\u201cAnything I\u2019m dispensing requires a prescription, it\u2019s just as simple as that,\u201d said Vincent Omo, a CVS pharmacist in Brownsville, Texas, a town that borders Mexico along the gulf coast. </p> <p>When Stephanie Trbula, a pharmacist at Cobb\u2019s, a small pharmacy in a small town near Corpus Christi, heard about the program, she immediately contacted Medicaid to receive information about the standing order and was able to put it into effect that same day. She put up advertisements outside her family\u2019s store and on Facebook, and called the local school nurse to let more people know about the program.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/14/florida-keys-zika-virus-genetically-modified-mosquitoes\">Zika virus: Floridians fear 'Pandora's box' of genetically altered mosquitos</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Trbula has had a number of people on Medicaid ask about the mosquito repellent for young children or the elderly, but so far no one has been eligible. Though her customers understood why the eligibility requirements were targeting pregnant women, \u201cthey were hoping it was for all ages\u201d, she said.</p> <p>Trbula\u2019s community hasn\u2019t had any cases yet, but she said people expect that Zika will be arriving in the area soon. \u201cThe mosquitoes around here are horrible right now. We have had so much rain in the past couple weeks that there\u2019s standing water that has been there for weeks now,\u201d she said. \u201cThe mosquitoes seem to be enormous. And I know all around us they\u2019re starting to see cases of Zika virus going into the hospital in San Antonio, Houston, so I know that it\u2019s just a matter of time before it\u2019s in our area as well.\u201d</p> <p>She is concerned for her pregnant sister-in-law in Austin, telling her to wear Deet, the <a href=\"http://www.txvendordrug.com/formulary/downloads/zika-products-pharmacy-assistance-chart.pdf\">preferred ingredient</a> in mosquito repellent, and to keep protected since \u201cright now they don\u2019t have anything other than prevention\u201d.</p> <p>But Texas women can only obtain two cans a month through 31 October, one at a time, meaning refills require two trips to the pharmacy \u2013 and potentially two prescriptions.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s still pharmacies out there who are not aware of the program, or who is covered or what is covered,\u201d said Dr Sharon Davis, the chief medical officer of Los Barrios Unidos, a group of family clinics in West Dallas and Grand Prairie, Texas. Davis said she had done \u201cspot calls\u201d the same morning checking in on individual pharmacies about it. </p> <p>\u201cMost of our patients, I\u2019d say 90%, are Hispanic and were really at high risk because a lot of patient population either travels or they may have a spouse that travels to Mexico, South America, things like that,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd because it\u2019s sexually transmitted, we really have to have everyone know about it.\u201d </p> <p>Dr Peter Hotez, dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine, said the measure was at least a start. That the benefit is ending soon is because arbovirus season in Texas and most of the southern part of the United States \u201ckind of ends by then, so this is the crunch time right now\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cPersonally, if we could afford it, I would like to see free Deet provided for all women,\u201d Hotez said.</p> <p>He is particularly concerned for women who are low income but do not qualify for Medicaid, and may have difficulty getting to a doctor if their pharmacy requires a prescription. In the past, <a href=\"http://archpedi.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=2529146\">Hotez has argued</a> that children may be equally susceptible to the disease. He suggested that monitoring cases of Zika to see where transmission occurred and control of <em>Aedes aegypti</em> are also critical measures.</p> <p>In Texas, 3.6 million men, women and children qualify for public health insurance under the state\u2019s very strict income requirements. As of October 2013, the most recent data available, about <a href=\"http://www.hhsc.state.tx.us/research/MedicaidEnrollment/ME/201310.html\">134,000 of those people</a> were pregnant women. </p> <p>Because of the austere requirements, the majority of people covered under Texas\u2019s Medicaid program are probably already pregnant or are children. This could be problematic, as scientists believe the most dangerous time for a fetus to be exposed to Zika is in the first trimester. </p> <p>The only <a href=\"https://yourtexasbenefits.hhsc.texas.gov/programs/health/young-adults-and-families\">able-bodied adults eligible for Medicaid</a> (who are not pregnant) are those who care for at least one child. For the parents of a family of four to qualify, the household needs to take home less than $227 a month.</p> <p>However, children in low-income families are far more likely to qualify, as are pregnant women. A child in a two-parent household would qualify if the parents made less than <a href=\"https://chipmedicaid.org/en/Can-I-Get-It\">$1,842 a month</a>. A single pregnant woman could qualify for Medicaid if she made <a href=\"https://yourtexasbenefits.hhsc.texas.gov/programs/health/women/pregnant\">$1,991 or less a month</a>, and would be covered until two months after the birth of her child. </p> <p>The US Department of Health and Human Services actually approved the use of <a href=\"http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2016/06/01/feds-say-medicaid-has-pay-zika-prevention-diagnosis-and-treatment/85240846/\">Medicaid for mosquito repellent in June</a>, but states along the gulf coast didn\u2019t start the programs until August, after Florida had local transmissions. </p> <p>For example, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/29/florida-zika-cases-mosquitoes-miami\">first four domestically acquired cases of Zika</a> were identified in the <a href=\"http://www.miamiherald.com/news/health-care/article97345352.html\">Wynwood neighborhood of Miami on 29 July</a>. The Mississippi division of Medicaid announced it would cover mosquito repellent on 1 August; by that time the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/01/florida-zika-cases-transmission-neighborhood-miami-dade-county\">total number of infections had risen to 14</a>. </p> <p>Texas announced it would provide mosquito repellent through Medicaid <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/04/florida-zika-virus-outbreak-miami-mosquitos\">two days later</a>. <a href=\"http://www.floridahealth.gov/newsroom/2016/08/080916-zika-update.html\">On 9 August</a>, when the number of locally acquired Zika cases in Florida hit 21, <a href=\"http://www.healthystartfv.org/repellent-available-through-medicaid-health-plans/\"> the state announced</a> it would provide mosquito repellent to Medicaid recipients, but people would need to call one of 15 providers to determine if they were eligible. </p> <p>One of the only gulf coast states\u2019 Medicaid programs to begin distributing mosquito repellent in June was Louisiana, though recipients there needed a prescription and could only obtain one can a month. </p> <p>In Texas, other gaps exist as well. Men on Medicaid will not be eligible for mosquito repellent, despite the fact that Zika can be transmitted sexually.</p> <p>The roughly 4.6 million Texans \u2013 or roughly 17% of the state\u2019s population \u2013 who don\u2019t have health insurance won\u2019t be able to obtain mosquito repellent as a benefit.

  "<p>The renowned Turkish novelist Asl\u0131 Erdo\u011fan says she is facing \u201cpermanent damage\u201d from the treatment she is receiving in prison after her arrest last week.</p> <p>Erdo\u011fan, an award-winning and celebrated Turkish novelist, was arrested in her home on the night of 16 August, according to <a href=\"http://www.actes-sud.fr/actualites/la-romanciere-turque-asli-erdogan-arretee-et-incarceree\">a statement from her French publisher Actes Sud</a>. A columnist and member of the pro-Kurdish opposition daily \u00d6zg\u00fcr G\u00fcndem\u2019s advisory board, which was shut down under the state of emergency that followed the failed coup of 15 July, her arrest came alongside that of more than 20 other journalists and employees of the paper. She was subsequently charged with \u201cmembership of a terrorist organisation\u201d and \u201cundermining national unity\u201d.</p> <p>Erdo\u011fan, whom the French literary magazine Lire named as one of the 50 most promising authors of the future, told the daily <a href=\"http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/arrested-turkish-novelist-asli-erdogan-mistreated-in-prison-during-arrest.aspx?PageID=238&amp;NID=103227&amp;NewsCatID=509\">H\u00fcrriyet</a> through her lawyer, Nesrullah O\u011fuz, that she was being treated in prison \u201cin a way that will leave permanent damage on my body\u201d. She said she was sleeping in a bed that had previously been urinated in, and that she was not able to get access to her medication.</p> <p>\u201cMy pancreas and digestive system don\u2019t work properly, but my medicine has not been given to me for five days. I am diabetic and I need special nutrition. But in jail I am only able to eat yoghurt,\u201d she said. \u201cAlso, even though I suffer from asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, I have not been allowed access to open air [since entering prison].\u201d</p> <p>Her detention has prompted a wave of calls for her release. \u201cWith the arrest of one of the nation\u2019s most celebrated and internationally known authors, we can see that no poet, novelist, or playwright is safe in [President] Erdo\u011fan\u2019s Turkey,\u201d said the novelist and translator Maureen Freely, president of English PEN, which is calling for the immediate release of those detained following the raid on \u00d6zg\u00fcr G\u00fcndem <em>\u201c</em>solely in connection with their work or peaceful exercise of their right to freedom of expression\u201d.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.change.org/p/asl%C4%B1-erdo%C4%9Fan-derhal-serbest-b%C4%B1rak%C4%B1ls%C4%B1n-free-asli-erdogan\">A petition calling for Erdo\u011fan\u2019s release</a> has been signed by almost 25,000 people. Describing her as \u201cone of the world\u2019s most notable novelists\u201d, the petition says that \u201cher only wish for her country is to live in a better, more democratic and civilised society\u201d, and that she \u201cproduces work towards this wish while promoting Turkish literature globally\u201d. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.pen-international.org/newsitems/turkey-serious-concerns-for-health-of-writer-and-activist-asli-erdogan-denied-water-medication/\">PEN International said it was \u201cdeeply concerned\u201d for her health</a>, describing the conditions in which she is being held as \u201cwholly unacceptable\u201d and calling on the Turkish authorities \u201cto immediately provide better conditions [and] ensure immediate access to medication and to her doctors as a matter of extreme urgency\u201d.</p> <p>Sahar Halaimzai, PEN International campaigns manager, said: \u201cThe crackdown on free speech that we are witnessing in Turkey is unprecedented in the country\u2019s modern history. The attempted coup does not justify the attack against all dissenting and critical voices. Asl\u0131 Erdo\u011fan is one of dozens of journalists currently behind bars in Turkey, held in difficult conditions and facing an uncertain fate. We strongly urge the Turkish government to halt this assault on free speech and human rights, and comply with their obligations under international law during this period of emergency.\u201d</p> <p>Erdo\u011fan told H\u00fcrriyet that she was aware of the solidarity being shown for her. \u201cI\u2019m aware that great efforts are being spent. I\u2019m aware of the sincerity and feelings in the messages that I receive. It may sound very vain, but I thank you very much,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Her arrest follows <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/aug/03/free-speech-groups-condemn-turkeys-closure-of-29-publishers-after-failed-coup\">the Turkish government\u2019s closure of 29 publishers under the state of emergency law</a>. The move has been condemned by publishers around the world, with the PEN International Publishers Circle saying that \u201cwhile recognising the right of the Turkish authorities to investigate and prosecute those responsible for the failed coup, [we] call on the Turkish authorities not to use the state of emergency to restrict lawful freedom of expression and to ensure that writers and publishers are able to freely carry out their activities\u201d.</p>",
  "<p>James Corden owes his surprise success in the US to a ratings-don\u2019t-matter strategy, according to the executive producer of his late-night CBS chat show.<br></p> <p>\u201cWhen I get in in the morning I will check our YouTube hits before I check our overnights [ratings],\u201d said Ben Winston, the man behind Corden\u2019s hit The Late Late Show. </p> <p>\u201cThe overnights just tell us who managed to stay awake. The YouTube hits tell us which bits flew,\u201d he told an audience at the Edinburgh Television Festival.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>The latest Corden clip taking flight is a freshly launched Carpool Karaoke featuring Britney Spears, which is set to become the 33rd YouTube clip from the show to crack 10m views since Corden took over from Craig Ferguson as the show\u2019s host.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Winston is rightly proud of the mini-format, in which singers and other celebrities sing along to their greatest hits and field unthreatening questions from Corden in the car. Adele, One Direction and Justin Bieber have appeared but the appearance of first lady, Michelle Obama, illustrates how far and how fast Corden has risen.</p> <p>\u201cIt has definitely struck a chord because it creates intimacy in such a lovely way,\u201d said Winston, a fellow Brit and close friend of Corden. \u201cYou\u2019re not getting Britney Spears on The Late Late Show and she\u2019s singing Hit Me Baby One More Time. Imagine telling the publicist that is what you wanted. Whereas with Carpool Karaoke we\u2019ll just put their greatest hits in there. Which is why it works.\u201d<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Winston said the digital strategy had re-invented how the success of any TV show should be measured, particularly one scheduled to air at midnight.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>\u201cThe thing we love about what we do with YouTube is everyone is equal and that is what is really great for us,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not about what time you\u2019re scheduled, it\u2019s not about whether you had the basketball that night compared to someone else. It is about the next day, and the next seven days, people finding your stuff.\u201d<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>The plaudits and rave reviews now showered on the show stand in stark contrast to the slim chance of success many observers gave Corden when he was unexpectedly recruited to enter the ferociously competitive US talk-show arena.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/jul/17/james-corden-michelle-obama-carpool-karaoke\">James Corden: \u2018My major ambition is just to stay relevant, to be in the conversation\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cThere\u2019s a great bit in that Jerry Seinfeld doc where someone asks him if being famous helps with doing standup and trying new material, and he says: \u2018I get three minutes of good grace from an audience whereas someone else gets 30 seconds,\u2019\u201d said Corden of the experience in an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/jul/17/james-corden-michelle-obama-carpool-karaoke\">interview with the Guardian last month</a>. \u201cWe very much felt that we just had 30 seconds. So we knew we had to put a stake in the ground early and go: \u2018We are a show where people come and do stuff.\u2019\u201d<br></p> <p>That stuff includes other hugely popular segments such as Pass the Mic, which has seen Corden engage in humorous rap battles with stars including David Schwimmer. Like Winston, Corden has been clear that as viewing habits change it is the online life of the show that he cares most about getting right.</p> <p>In 17 months his show\u2019s YouTube channel has attracted 7 million subscribers and notched up 1.7bn views worldwide. \u201cI\u2019m only driven by that,\u201d said Corden. \u201cI genuinely couldn\u2019t tell you how many people watch our show, because I feel like in this slot we\u2019re not really in the ratings business, we\u2019re just in the relevance business. My major ambition is just to stay relevant.\u201d</p> <p>Winston said he had no idea how much revenue CBS makes directly off the back of the video views on YouTube, but the global success of the digital strategy has allowed them to leverage far more lucrative deals than relying on pushing TV ratings numbers to advertisers.<br></p> <p>These include McDonald\u2019s paying a hefty sum to be the destination, and food, featured in Corden\u2019s Carpool Karaoke with Selena Gomez. The deal also included the show being promoted nationwide for six months on McDonald\u2019s products.<br></p> <p>\u201cBecause of our YouTube numbers we\u2019ve been able to make deals that fundamentally as a midnight show we wouldn\u2019t be able to,\u201d said Winston. \u201cWe are in 155 countries. If we weren\u2019t doing the numbers we do on YouTube I\u2019m not sure the commissioners and executives across the world would be wanting to buy the show. That makes it very, very profitable. We\u2019ve been able to work out a different way to monetise our show than maybe what CBS has done in the past.\u201d<br></p> <p>He admitted that the show was perceived as cool and they had to be careful about \u201cselling out\u201d. He said the decision about whether to tie-up with McDonald\u2019s, even though it was a subtle association, was debated for many hours.<br></p> <p>\u201cAs long as you invest in the digital side, have a huge presence in the marketing space there on the digital side, then that is how you speak to the new generation,\u201d said Winston. \u201cOtherwise I don\u2019t quite know how the networks will carry on in the way they are. The CBSs, NBCs, ABCs, Foxes need to, of course, get on board with the way TV is moving. A show like ours has shown they can do that.\u201d<br></p> <h2>Most viewed Carpool Karaoke segments </h2> <p><strong>1</strong> Adele \u2013 123m views</p> <p><strong>2</strong> Justin Bieber \u2013 90m</p> <p><strong>3</strong> One Direction \u2013 80m</p> <p><strong>4</strong> Sia \u2013 59m</p> <p><strong>5</strong> Jennifer Lopez \u2013 49m</p> <p><strong>6</strong> Selena Gomez \u2013 44m</p> <p><strong>7</strong> Michelle Obama \u2013 41m</p>",

It is however often the last thing that the two people think about. Divorce is all about that business partnership whether it is cojointly owned property, a shared rental agreement, superannuation, bank accounts, ownership of goods and chattels, life insurance, shared debt liabilities in business arrangements, taxation implications and this does not begin to look at shared parental responsibilities. Looking at the business/financial relationship is something two people in love are unlikely to seriously look at prior to marriage unless they are serious people and good friends to boot. They will probably have a better go at being happier together as it is known that the early romance fades at about 12-18 months - long enough to get through the wedding, to have a first baby and then to settle in to a comfortable oxytocin-infused cohabitation.</p> <p>Better be good friends, good-humoured and sensible with money and managing and engaging with family and friends from then on.</p> <p>For many people divorce is not the end-of-the-world though it can seem so at the time. It is usually initiated by one of the couple who has considered it for some long time and announces it when he or she is very psychologically ready. The initiator may have already made alternative arrangements for their own living arrangement. The person being left is the one who faces greatest upheaval and sense of lost control over his/her life and it may be that they are having to genuinely confront lifestyle issues around alcohol, gambling or other addictions. On the other hand they may have nothing of that and it is the other party leaving so as to continue a career of drugs/alcohol or other marriage-incompatible behaviour. </p> <p>Whatever the complex reasons requiring the two to be held in suspended animation for two years before they can act to finalise a divorce would have serious financial and psychological implications. It is an unnecessarily long time to put people's lives on hold and I could not see how it would prevent the ultimate outcome. I wonder if there have been comparative studies on the level of trauma and subsequent readjustment.

The amount of pressure applied on young couples to engage in something so antiquated and archaic probably doesn't help in the context of building a life together. We already have a one year old son so we're more tied for life through that than any ceremony we could go through. The whole thing was just an exercise in people trying to rip us off for specially made jam jars to go on 're-conditioned' tables in a room that cost a fortune because we wanted to get married. The whole wedding and marriage industry has become so vulgar and materialistic it's no wonder that divorce has become so common. The causes of divorce need to be investigated further but yes of course divorce laws need overhauling. Why anybody would want to pay 5k for a wedding these days baffles me.</p></div> </div> </div>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57bfe645e4b0568600c0467b\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-08-26T14:42:42.841Z\">3.42pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Advice to an aspiring journalist</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>This week Charlie, 23, from Wiltshire asked for advice on getting into journalism via our form <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/17/question-guardian-social-journalist\">(where we invite you to ask our journalists questions)</a>. Here\u2019s the response we got from Polly Curtis, the Guardian\u2019s digital editor, and Will Coldwell, a journalist who works on the travel section. These two journalists, at different points in their career, offer their tips below.<br></p> <h2>Polly Curtis</h2> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>1. <strong>Work</strong>. Sounds simple but take every opportunity, in every context to be busy and learn. Don\u2019t sit still and wait. Be hungry and go for it. You can get work alongside your degree and it will complement it. 2. <strong>Listen</strong>. The best journalists are thinking about what is being said to them, rather than what their next question is. 3. <strong>Put the blinkers up</strong>. It\u2019s an incredibly competitive business, but don\u2019t be distracted by that. In my experience of getting into journalism it is actually very meritocratic. Editors are hungry for talent and it tends to shine through in a newsroom.</p> </blockquote> <h2>Will Coldwell<br></h2> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>My advice for getting into journalism at this stage is to, well, just do it. Sure, you could write for your student paper, but think beyond the institution \u2013 write for blogs, websites, mags and be led by the areas that interest you and the things that you have experience of that others may not.</p> <p>Even better, while you\u2019re working on getting those first commissions, just make your own publication. I started out making (probably quite crappy) DIY zines with my friends, which gave me an excuse to write about things I liked and interview people I thought were cool, but it was far more motivating than waiting for someone to tell me what I wanted to write was worth something.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57bfe6f9e4b04866298903ef\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/sarah-marsh\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-08-26T14:23:42.177Z\">3.23pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Moderators choose a conversation of the week</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Our team of moderators highlighted this great discussion under an article on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/caster-semenya\">Caster Semenya</a>, the women\u2019s 800m gold medallist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/23/caster-semenya-olympic-spirit-iaaf-athletes-women\">who has been the subject of controversy</a> because of speculation surrounding her levels of testosterone. <br></p> <h2>Silent_sunrise</h2> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The cruelty and inhumanity, whether deliberate or not, towards Caster Semenya is upsetting to me so how horrible it must have felt for her at the time doesn\u2019t bear thinking. Seemed so immature of the losers.</p> </blockquote> <h2>KingWizard</h2> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Some people seem to have more disdain for Caster Semenya than athletes that have actually taken drugs.</p> </blockquote> <h2>Timmyb</h2> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It\u2019s a difficult predicament. Firstly, let\u2019s not pretend the Olympics is just a celebration of sport, it is at its base the most prestigious elite competition. Athletes spend four years of their life building up to it and probably another 10 or 20 learning their trade before they get anywhere near that level. They have a right to feel aggravated if they think someone has such an advantage that means thy will never be able to compete for the top prizes.<br></p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57c04b5fe4b0fe30498a5025\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-08-26T14:11:27.183Z\">3.11pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>You\u2019re still sharing baking successes and failures via GuardianWitness \u2013 including some wedding related which really did seem to go well.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-witness element-witness-image\" itemscope itemtype=\"http://schema.org/ImageObject\" data-media-id=\"https://witness.theguardian.com/assignment/57b6dacbe4b062ce4d224d8a/5000908\"> <div class=\"element-witness--main\">  <a href=\"https://witness.theguardian.com/assignment/57b6dacbe4b062ce4d224d8a/5000908\" itemprop=\"url\"><img src=\"https://gu-witness.s3.amazonaws.com/media/8cd71314-dd66-4a9f-9c2f-a8ae5daad105-mediumoriginalaspectdouble.jpg\" alt=\"Wedding cake\" itemprop=\"contentURL\"/></a>    <figcaption>  <h3 class=\"element-witness--title\" itemprop=\"name\"><a href=\"https://witness.theguardian.com/assignment/57b6dacbe4b062ce4d224d8a/5000908\" itemprop=\"url\">Wedding cake</a></h3>  <div itemprop=\"description\"> <p>Made by me (dad), for our son&#39;s wedding.</p> </div>   </figcaption>  </div> <footer class=\"element-witness--footer\"> <p class=\"element-witness--source\">Sent via <a href=\"https://witness.theguardian.com/\" class=\"element-witness--brand\" itemprop=\"provider\">GuardianWitness</a></p> <div class=\"element-witness--metadata\"> <p class=\"element-witness--author\" itemprop=\"author\" itemscope itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\">  By  <a href=\"https://witness.theguardian.com/user/terry101\" class=\"element-witness--author-name\" itemprop=\"name\">terry101</a> </p> <p class=\"element-witness--date\"> <time itemprop=\"dateCreated\" datetime=\"2016-08-24T21:39:09+01:00\">24 August 2016, 21:39</time> </p> </div> </footer>  </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-witness element-witness-image\" itemscope itemtype=\"http://schema.org/ImageObject\" data-media-id=\"https://witness.theguardian.com/assignment/57b6dacbe4b062ce4d224d8a/5000872\"> <div class=\"element-witness--main\">  <a href=\"https://witness.theguardian.com/assignment/57b6dacbe4b062ce4d224d8a/5000872\" itemprop=\"url\"><img src=\"https://gu-witness.s3.amazonaws.com/media/2a846903-0253-407b-8813-d21f19692d22-mediumoriginalaspectdouble.jpg\" alt=\"First Attempt at Wedding Cakes\" itemprop=\"contentURL\"/></a>    <figcaption>  <h3 class=\"element-witness--title\" itemprop=\"name\"><a href=\"https://witness.theguardian.com/assignment/57b6dacbe4b062ce4d224d8a/5000872\" itemprop=\"url\">First Attempt at Wedding Cakes</a></h3>  <div itemprop=\"description\"> <p>My girlfriend and I (who are not professional bakers but had made a well received cake for my dad&#39;s birthday a few months before) were asked to make cakes for my brothers wedding.

He\u2019s not the only one. Resolution, the organisation of family lawyers who favour a non-confrontational, mediating approach, has long been calling for the introduction of a no-fault divorce. At present, unless you have been living apart from your spouse for at least two years, the only way to get divorced quickly is by citing adultery or unreasonable behaviour. Often neither have occurred. Other countries have a no-fault system, but MPs seem to have no desire to introduce it here. A no-fault divorce, say those who oppose it, would undermine marriage.

It\u2019s because of this rigid idea of masculinity that suicide is the biggest killer of young men under age 45 in this country. <br></p> <p><em>What do you think about this?

Like me, Hossenfelder receives a lot of correspondence from amateur physicists. Usually they claim to have proved Einstein wrong, or that a recent breakthrough is a fraud; sometimes they are reporting a breakthrough of their own. All are frustrated that mainstream academics and media alike are ignoring their work. As someone who, unfortunately, does mostly hit delete, I was fascinated by Hossenfelder\u2019s own decision to stop deleting and start engaging. She has opened a hotline, offering physics consultation, including theory development. There are, of course, arguments to be had about whether charging people to talk science is promoting a different type of insiderism. But it\u2019s an interesting form of engagement and seems to be working \u2013 one of her clients is even preparing to publish a bona fide academic paper.</p> <p><em>What have you been reading this week?

The Guardian and C4 seem to be the only media outlets attempting some perspective but it's not enough</p></div> </div> </div>  </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-comment\" data-canonical-url=\"https://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/81937384\">  <div class=\"d2-comment-embedded\" itemscope itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Comment\"> <div class=\"d2-left-col\"> <a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/1823571\" title=\"View notjarvis\u2019s profile\"> <img class=\"d2-avatar\" src=\"https://avatar.guim.co.uk/user/1823571\" height=\"40\" width=\"40\" alt=\"User avatar for notjarvis\"> </a> </div> <div class=\"d2-right-col\"> <div itemscope itemprop=\"author\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\"> <a class=\"d2-username\" href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/1823571\" title=\"View notjarvis\u2019s profile\" itemprop=\"url\"> <span itemprop=\"givenName\">notjarvis</span> </a> </div> <div class=\"d2-permalink\"> <a class=\"d2-datetime\" href=\"https://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/81937384\" title=\"Link to this comment\" itemprop=\"datePublished\">26 August 2016 12:15pm</a> </div> <div class=\"d2-body\" itemprop=\"text\"><p>Traingate would have been at least a single day news story, or should have been news, if any politician was caught in a dispute with a major company as Corbyn and his team were..</p> <p>What made it last more than a day were the Confused stories about it from his team, and momentum members.<br />If A spokesperson of Corbyn's team straight away said &quot;OK there were a few seats, but we wanted to sit together and like other people sat on the floor for part of the journey, apologies for exaggerating slightly with &quot;Ram-packed&quot;, but we were attempting to highlight the terrible train service.&quot;</p> <p>Instead there were a load of confused messages from different parts of his team, which helped perpetuate the story overnight, leaving it to Corbyn to come with a different story the day after (which had been explicitly denied the day before).</p> <p>Sometimes just apologising in some way and moving on kills the story dead, but the utter chaos in his team has no concept of media/crisis management it appears.</p></div> </div> </div>  </figure>  <p>Share your thoughts by getting involved in the comments below.<br></p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-08-26T12:32:41.389Z\">at 1.32pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57befd82e4b0568600c0436c\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/martin-belam\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-08-26T11:39:17.575Z\">12.39pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">#Traingate: why I spent the day on the 11am train to Newcastle</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>I spent Wednesday going from London to York and back, trying to recreate the fateful #traingate trip that Jeremy Corbyn had made. Was it a ridiculous gimmick? Well, of course. Doing it live perhaps added more of an air of ridiculousness to the proceedings than just quietly popping up there and back and interviewing people. But it also generated huge interest. We had over 5,500 comments on the live blog \u2013 not all of them calling me an idiot \u2013 and after I\u2019d got off the train I settled down into a place with wifi where I could carry on joining in the debate below the line, and also try and reflect some of the discussion that was going on above the line.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2016/aug/23/jeremy-corbyn-takes-a-seat-on-ram-packed-virgin-train-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/5x278\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2678543\"            data-video-name=\"Jeremy Corbyn takes a seat on 'ram-packed' Virgin train \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"Virgin Trains\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-57bc5d82e4b048662988f603\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/08/23/160823train3_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/08/23/160823train3.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/08/23/160823train3_WebM.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2016/aug/23/jeremy-corbyn-takes-a-seat-on-ram-packed-virgin-train-video\">Jeremy Corbyn takes a seat on \u2018ram-packed\u2019 Virgin train</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>It\u2019s a classic political silly season story, but I hoped the train trip would provide a different angle for people to talk about rail policy in the UK, which was, of course, one of Corbyn\u2019s first concrete policy suggestions when he became leader. And, after all, where better to find rail users to ask them what they think about services than on a train.</p> <p>I met some lovely people, and I do enjoy this kind of reporting. I also spent a night on the London Underground at the weekend meeting people who were using the night tube for the first time.

  "<p>Inside Madison Square Garden dozens of MTV staff and hundreds of crew are busy preparing for the network\u2019s annual festival of the absurd, better known as the Video Music Awards. It\u2019s the show\u2019s first time at the arena and its preparation and load-in has been a massive undertaking. It was three years ago when producers first started discussing the idea to house MTV\u2019s crown jewel at the \u201cworld\u2019s most famous arena\u201d, and it\u2019s all about to coalesce on Sunday night when years of work result in a equally headline-grabbing and smooth-moving spectacle. Well, that\u2019s the plan.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2016/aug/25/mtv-vmas-greatest-awards-show-on-earth\">Why the MTV VMAs are still the greatest awards show on earth</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cSometimes you think the show\u2019s going to be one thing and then it turns into something else,\u201d explains Garrett English, one of the executive producers of this year\u2019s show, which sounds like code for: we don\u2019t know what is going to happen. He\u2019s been working in some capacity with MTV and the Video Music Awards for the past two decades, and is well aware that things can quickly spin out of control. </p> <p>\u201cWe create a pretty volatile environment that can be combustable at times, and that\u2019s part of what the show\u2019s about,\u201d English says about expecting the unexpected, no doubt a major component of the VMA\u2019s allure, whether it was that famous kiss between Britney Spears and Madonna, or the infamous interruption of Taylor Swift by Kanye West. \u201cThose are scary moments for a producer for sure, but it\u2019s something you can\u2019t manufacture.\u201d</p> <p>Fortunately for English and producer Erik Flannigan, there are some things you can control. \u201cOur lineup of who performs is always a fluid situation,\u201d explains Flannigan, while the vast screen and lighting rig propped up on the stage behind him twinkles and flashes in preparation for this year\u2019s scheduled moments, including ballyhooed VMA return of Britney Spears (her first since 2007) and an epic medley by pop superstar Rihanna. \u201cI know who\u2019s opening, but won\u2019t say because that\u2019s all part of the fun. But everything else always changes. Last year when Taylor Swift and Nicki Minaj started the show together, that was something that we only planned a few days out.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"890283754a9e118a675cde7e113068fe2a65fc4a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/890283754a9e118a675cde7e113068fe2a65fc4a/151_157_5284_3171/1000.jpg\" alt=\"VMAs\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Kanye West and Kim Kardashian will be attending this year\u2019s VMAs, while signs point to Taylor Swift skipping out.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Angela Weiss/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Besides the show\u2019s musical moments, which are also poised to include rapper Future and a cameo-filled Nick Jonas performance of his new single Bacon at an as-yet undisclosed remote location, producers are also scurrying up a list of presenters, from comedians like former VMA host Jimmy Fallon to actors such as Ansel Elgort. There will be athletes in attendance as well, from Michael Phelps to the US women\u2019s gymnastics team. \u201cThe moment they won gold, we were like, \u2018We have to get them into the room,\u201d says Flannigan of Olympians Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas, Laurie Hernandez, Madison Kocian and Aly Raisman. \u201cI think they\u2019re going to be the biggest celebrities there, I swear to God. It\u2019s going to be Kim and Kanye wanting to take picture with the Olympians, not the other way around.\u201d</p> <p>Speaking of West and his everlasting, publicity-generating feud with Taylor Swift, the talk this year is also swirling about who\u2019s not attending. While Yeezy himself will indeed be in the audience with wife Kim close by, all signs point to Swift skipping out on this year\u2019s festivities entirely. Fellow superstar nominee Adele, in the midst of a world tour, also won\u2019t be gracing the VMA stage. \u201cShe\u2019s had some great moments with us, but it was never a conversation of no Adele versus having her,\u201d says English. \u201cFor a variety of reasons, it just didn\u2019t work.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>People enjoy watching because it\u2019s so rare to see talent behave like real people</p> <footer> <cite>Erik Flannigan</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>However, one star which will be on full display won\u2019t be any one artist, but the building itself. After bouncing between locations such as The Forum in Los Angeles and Brooklyn\u2019s Barclays Center, the show lands at Madison Square Garden for the first time in its history. \u201cWe aren\u2019t sure why it took so long,\u201d says English, as comedy duo Key and Peele begin to rehearse a comedy sketch slated for the show on an elevated stage near the arena\u2019s balcony. \u201cThe Garden\u2019s obviously been on our list for a while, but it\u2019s obviously a building that\u2019s hard to get into, creatively and otherwise.\u201d (MTV rented out the venue for 12 days, something a longtime security guard at the venue interjected was \u201cvirtually unheard of\u201d.) \u201cGetting here represents the pinnacle of an artist\u2019s career,\u201d according to English. \u201cWe\u2019ve always tried to figure out when was the right time for us to do that. The show has been in intimate environments and big rooms, and each year we try to reinvent what we do with it.\u201d</p> <p>The reinvention of the spectacle on an annual basis is something that\u2019s kept it fresh since the show\u2019s inaugural broadcast in 1984. (This year\u2019s performer Ariana Grande was still nine years away from birth.)

  "<p>Activists have occupied the lobby of the Crown Prosecution Service offices in Birmingham, calling for police officers to be prosecuted over the 2011 death of a student.</p> <p>On Friday, about 20 protesters chanted \u201cWho are the murderers? Police are the murderers\u201d, \u201cno justice, no peace\u201d and \u201cblack lives matter\u201d, waved placards that read \u201cshut it down\u201d, and recited the names of black men who had died after coming into contact with the police.</p> <p>They vowed not to leave until a senior representative of the CPS spoke to them. </p> <p>Desmond Jaddoo, coordinator of the Justice for Kingsley Burrell campaign, said the protest was the start of more direct action. The sit-in included members of the Black Lives Matter campaign, who were wearing Black Lives Matter T-shirts or displaying banners with the slogan. </p> <p>A CPS area business manager, Karen Sawicki, came to the lobby more than two hours into the sit-in to accept a letter that the protesters asked be passed directly to Alison Saunders, the director of public prosecutions, highlighting the delays in reaching a charging decision. </p> <p>\u201cWe need justice now as justice delayed is justice denied,\u201d the letter said. </p> <p>Burrell\u2019s sister Kadisha said afterwards: \u201cI think today definitely went well \u2013 we managed to have our direct action in a peaceful way. Getting a reaction from the community to let them know that Kingsley\u2019s death hasn\u2019t been in vain \u2013 it goes to show it\u2019s a serious issue, what happened to Kingsley.\u201d</p> <p>Burrell, a student and father of three, died in March 2011 from a heart attack four days after being detained under the Mental Health Act.

He was treated like a dog. He was treated like an animal.\u201d</p> <p>She and their mother, Janet Burrell, joined those occupying the CPS offices.</p> <p>Jaddoo told the Guardian the case had been \u201cshrouded in delays\u201d from the outset.</p> <p>He said: \u201cIt took 18 months for them to release his body for burial, and four years to get to inquest.\u201d</p> <p>The inquest recorded what Jaddoo described as a \u201cdamning verdict of negligence\u201d against agencies including the police, but the family was concerned by the evidence given by three officers and complained to theIndependent Police Complaints Commission that they appeared to have perjured themselves.</p> <p>The IPCC <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/oct/22/three-police-officers-testimony-death-student-kingsley-burrell\">passed a file to the CPS for a charging decision</a> last October. The family met the CPS on Tuesday and told the demonstrators they expect to hear in the next fortnight whether charges would be brought against the officers. Kadisha Burrell said: \u201cIt doesn\u2019t look promising at all.\u201d</p> <p>She added: \u201cWe want them to prosecute: there\u2019s more than enough evidence \u2026 we\u2019re anxious. We can\u2019t wait any more.\u201d She denied her brother had mental health problems.</p> <p>The CPS had previously declined to bring charges against the officers. It said there was insufficient evidence to prosecute after the IPCC\u2019s initial investigation into the death.</p> <p>Janet Burrell told the Guardian about the wait for the CPS decision. She said: \u201cYou can\u2019t move on with your life. Your life\u2019s left on hold, you\u2019re constantly waiting, waiting in vain for answers.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m hoping we get the right answers. The state has a duty of care to protect vulnerable young people. I just want to know why my son\u2019s not here today \u2026 My son called the police for help and ended up dead, and that was the result, and nobody can tell me the reason why.\u201d</p> <p>Her son\u2019s inquest last year heard <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/may/15/kingsley-burrell-restrained-by-police-died-from-neglect-inquest-finds\">he was taken into custody after calling police</a> to say he was being threatened with a gun in Birmingham city centre. After CCTV showed that he was not being followed, he was detained. There was a violent struggle with police officers in the back of an ambulance and Burrell had a heart attack that led to brain damage, the inquest heard.</p> <p>Burrell had been left handcuffed on the hospital floor for five or six hours before being assessed, and had wet himself. At one point he had a covering put over his face.</p> <p>Jurors at the six-week inquest found that neglect by police officers and ambulance staff who forcibly restrained him caused his death. The verdict led his family to call for a public inquiry.</p> <p>The IPCC, which investigates deaths in police custody, launched an investigation in April 2011 during which four West Midlands police officers were interviewed under police caution, a spokesman said. Dorset police force carried out a separate investigation into medical staff.</p> <p>More than two years later, the IPCC passed a file to the CPS for a decision on whether three officers should be charged with gross misconduct on the grounds of honesty and integrity. The CPS decided there was insufficient evidence prosecute in June 2014.</p> <p>The officers gave evidence at the inquest, leading to a complaint on behalf of the family to the IPCC, which again investigated and passed a file to the CPS, which has not yet announced a decision.</p> <p>A CPS spokesman said on Friday that officials had met the family three days earlier to update them on the case. He added: \u201cThe CPS has been considering this matter since it was referred to us by the IPCC in October 2015 and are mindful of the impact this continues to have on the family.</p> <p>\u201cWe are still considering the evidence passed to us and will make a decision in due course.\u201d</p> <p>Jaddoo said the case highlighted \u201cconsistent inequalities and injustices that the black community face[s] when coming into contact with the police\u201d.</p>",
  "<p>One evening in the summer of 2005, I&nbsp;heard the American artist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/spencer-tunick\">Spencer Tunick</a> being interviewed on Radio 4 about his planned mass naked art installation in Newcastle. He was looking for volunteers for it on the day I was due to be there, as I was travelling up from London. I thought it might be a practical joke, but decided to go along anyway.</p> <p>On the day, I showered in my hotel room before heading to the meeting place, a car park, at about 2am; Tunick wanted to photograph us in the dawn light. I&nbsp;was nervous, but as soon as I saw the other volunteers I felt fine. One naked person might be seen as an exhibitionist, but to be one of a crowd doing the same thing seemed very different.</p> <p>There were more than 1,500 people queueing to be registered, some full of fear and dread, others annoyingly exuberant (probably to mask their fear). When we took our clothes off, there was nothing sexual in it at all. We had been advised to bring no valuables and as few clothes as was practical, and were concerned with getting our clothes into the carrier bags that were lined up in the car park in four different colours, so we could find them at the end. I kept my eyes firmly above the chin when looking around, and&nbsp;everyone else seemed to be doing the same. Soon it became as normal, as if we were all out for a walk together.</p> <p>By 3am, dawn was breaking and we were marching over <a href=\"http://www.gateshead.gov.uk/Leisure%20and%20Culture/attractions/bridge/Home.aspx\">Gateshead Millennium Bridge</a>. The atmosphere was very jolly and there was a great sense of community. As we walked from the docks to the second site, The Side, we were greeted by cheers from&nbsp;the windows of early-rising locals. If one naked person walks along the street, the onlookers have&nbsp;authority, but when you are&nbsp;part of a naked group, you have the authority.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2016/aug/12/one-person-picket-fran-death-protests-greenham-common\">\u2018I made a one-person picket\u2019: Fran De\u2019Ath protests at Greenham Common</a> </p> </aside>  <p>When Tunick stood on the bridge looking down at us through his lens, I&nbsp;realised it wasn\u2019t quite so easy to disappear into the background.

Next, we stood on the steps of the Sage Gallery, before reaching the fourth and final site, the Baltic Centre for Contemporary Art, or \u201cthat 1984-looking building\u201d as Tunick called it. We stood up for one photograph and lay down for another, before wandering back to our clothes and our normal lives.</p> <p>The next day, all the papers covered the story and I framed this picture and hung it up at home. \u201cYour newspaper has a picture of me with no clothes on today,\u201d I\u2019d say to friends.

  "<p>When Kidulthood came out in 2006, I was 15 years old and it felt like a defining moment. Other cities had their representation of youth culture just over a decade before, in 1995. In Paris it was La Haine and in New York it was Kids. Before that, Boyz n the Hood and Menace II Society had paved the way for raw and gritty films that dealt with violence, social issues and navigating the road to adulthood.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/audio/2016/aug/26/julieta-brotherhood-popstar-and-purge-election-year-film-weekly-podcast\">Julieta, Brotherhood, Popstar and Purge: Election Year \u2013 Film Weekly podcast</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Kidulthood follows a group of teenagers the day after the suicide of one of their classmates. Given a day off school to mourn, 15-year-old Trife and ex-girlfriend Alisa try to distract themselves from her newly discovered pregnancy. Trife, with his friends Moony and Jay, struggle against the prejudice of cab drivers and security guards and end up tangled in trouble with school bad boy Sam. Alisa trades sexual favours for drugs with Becky, a young girl with an air of confidence who is being exploited by older, richer men.</p> <p>The parents in the film are well-intentioned but clueless about the pressure, bullying and daily issues their kids face. Ultimately, the spiralling loss of control of these situations results in the death of Trife at the hands of Sam at a house party.</p> <p>Kidulthood was special because it was the first film I felt was made for an audience like me. It was urgent and relevant because it dealt with a world that is so often underrepresented and misunderstood. With no contrived heroes, the characters felt familiar and convincing, concerned with video games, sex and the choices that could change their lives forever.</p> <p>The soundtrack featured British artists such as Wiley, Dizzee Rascal and The Streets whose tracks I had on my iPod Mini. Everything about the film seemed authentic and close to home.</p> <p>The film gained my trust as a teenager because it was intent on telling a reality that was largely unrecorded in other films that I had come across at the time or in the media in general. When Adulthood was released two years later, I was eager to see what was next. As the title suggested, it was darker and more grown up. <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2014/dec/26/noel-clarke-my-family-values\">Noel Clarke</a>, who had written Kidulthood and starred as Sam, took over as director and continued to tell the story six years on from the death of Trife.

My favourite scene was when Sam burst out of the window away from the police with Skrein\u2019s Reach in the background. It was powerful and I liked what Clarke had done with it. A year later, I found myself in a police station in the Dominican Republic following a hectic 24 hours in which I was mugged at gunpoint in Santo Domingo. After eventually sorting out my papers the police officer turned to me and said: \u201cYou\u2019re British right?\u201d \u201cYeah\u201d I replied. \u201cI\u2019m watching a film from your country and I\u2019m finding it difficult to understand all of your slang. What does \u2018gash\u2019 mean?\u201d he asked. It turned out he was watching Kidulthood and I ended up watching the remainder of the film with him, translating what was going on.</p> <p>I hadn\u2019t given much thought to the language in the film up until that point, but it made me realise another reason why the film resonated with me so much. Often writers for TV and film don\u2019t do a very convincing job of recreating the language that young people use. Clarke changed that.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/aug/11/from-molenbeek-to-hollywood-why-belgian-thriller-black-is-the-new-la-haine\">From Molenbeek to Hollywood \u2013 why Belgian thriller Black is the new La Haine</a> </p> </aside>  <p>This was something he continued in <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/nov/13/noel-clarke-kidulthood-trilogy-followup-brotherhood\">Brotherhood</a>, which I saw last week. Sam\u2019s age was apparent when juxtaposed with the fresh blood of Stormzy\u2019s character, who mocks him for still using the word \u201cblud\u201d. Clarke is aware that times have changed and he knows his core audience is looking at these details.</p> <p>Watching on, I wondered if these would be lost on critics. Clarke upped the ante with the finale and clearly wanted to have some fun with it. It doesn\u2019t feel as real as Kidulthood, but that doesn\u2019t matter to me. I\u2019ve grown into adulthood with these films and apart from perhaps the Channel 4 series Top Boy, there has been very few that have come close to them.</p> <p>Over time I\u2019ve realised that it\u2019s been important for me to follow the actors in the film even more than the characters themselves. Seeing someone like Clarke write a film with such a diverse cast has been inspirational. Now I\u2019m a bit older I am more aware of what kinds of challenges minorities face in film, entertainment and media. I have great respect for what this trilogy has achieved. Brotherhood gave me a sense of closure in what has been a defining decade in my life. I just hope the next generation has more films like this, that reflect who they are and inspire them with ideas of what they could be.</p>",

After all, it\u2019s much easier to horrify moderate voters \u2013 and motivate the party base \u2013 with Trump\u2019s plans to deport 11 million US residents, close the borders to a billion Muslims, launch a trade war with China and cozy up to Vladimir Putin.</p> <p>In this target-rich environment, who has the time or energy to go after his credibility?</p> <p>Why, Donald Trump does, of course.</p> <p>This week the GOP nominee managed to flip-flop on his signature issue: the one that got him through all those noisy primary debates. The one that allowed him to destroy most of his rivals and connect at a visceral level with the party\u2019s nativist core.</p> <p>Of Trump\u2019s top three opponents \u2013 Marco Rubio, Ted Cruz and Jeb Bush \u2013 two are Latino and one is married to a Latina. Trump tarred all three, despite their protestations, with the same brush of being soft on immigration.</p> <p>And then, out of sheer desperation or stupidity, Trump decided this week to copy them. At a town hall-style show on Fox News, hosted by his unofficial adviser Sean Hannity, the GOP candidate <a href=\"http://www.foxnews.com/transcript/2016/08/24/trump-asks-his-supporters-to-weigh-in-on-deportation-policy/\">rolled out</a> his kinder, gentler immigration policy to a mixed response from the crowd.</p> <p>\u201cSo you have somebody that\u2019s been in the country for 20 years, has done a great job, has a job, everything else, OK. Do we take him and the family, her or him or whatever, and send them out? Are they gone?\u201d Trump mused out loud.</p> <p>\u201cOr when somebody really has shown \u2013 you know, it\u2019s called like the merit system \u2013 other than they did break the law in the first place, OK \u2026 So do we tell these people to get out, number one, or do we work with them and let them stay in some cases?\u201d</p> <p>And so it came to pass, with a rambling response on Fox News, that Trump demolished the foundation of his own campaign. Which naturally left his audience a little confused.</p> <p>Trump may have previously given the impression that he thought all these undocumented immigrants were little more than a gang of murderers and rapists. But now, after some reflection, he concedes there may be some decent families mixed in with the gangs of thugs. Under Trump\u2019s new plan, there would be no citizenship for these people, but there would be legal status after the payment of some back taxes.</p> <p>This plan is otherwise known as the Obama proposal for comprehensive immigration reform.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve had very strong people come up to me, really great, great people come up to me,\u201d he explained on Fox News. \u201cAnd they\u2019ve said, Mr Trump, I love you, but to take a person that\u2019s been here for 15 or 20 years and throw them and the family out. It\u2019s so tough, Mr Trump. I mean, I have it all the time!

But when pressed about Trump\u2019s paramilitaries on CNN, his new campaign manager Kellyanne Conway said meekly: \u201cHe has not said that for a while.\u201d</p> <p>Back in 2004, John Kerry\u2019s campaign was destroyed for pointing out obtusely that he had voted both for and against funding the Iraq war. This flip-floppery led to TV ads of him windsurfing back and forth to the tune of the Blue Danube. As a result, it was hard to think of a less manly American leader in the midst of the war on terror.</p> <p>If you\u2019re wondering what Team Bush thinks of Donald Trump\u2019s far more dramatic flip-flop, you don\u2019t have to look that far. Jeb Bush, the low-energy brother who was so easily dispatched by Donald Trump in the GOP primaries, told WABC radio that the nominee\u2019s reversals were \u201cabhorrent\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cSounds like a typical politician,\u201d Bush said. \u201cAll the things Donald Trump railed against, he seems to be morphing into. I don\u2019t know what to believe about a guy who doesn\u2019t believe in things.\u201d</p> <p>If only he had been capable of such quips in the primaries, he might now be working on his transition to government.</p> <p>Of course, in later speeches and interviews, Trump suggested he might deport more people. Or fewer. Depending on the TV interview or crowd he\u2019s talking to at the time.</p> <p>Until now, honesty has been one of the very few areas where Trump has been running ahead of Hillary Clinton. While both candidates score poorly on such traits, Trump still maintained an edge, according to a recent NBC News/Survey Monkey <a href=\"http://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2016-election/poll-clinton-maintains-big-lead-voters-doubt-trump-s-temperament-n631351\">poll</a>. Even while losing badly overall to Clinton, Trump enjoyed a five-point advantage over Clinton on being honest and trustworthy. This is unlikely to last for much longer.</p> <p>The bottom fell out of the Trump campaign last month after a disastrous convention season. He picked a miserable fight with a Muslim American gold star family, and gave a series of TV interviews that would have got him fired from his own show. Straight talk, no matter how offensive, was his last remaining quality.</p> <p>People say that Trump learns nothing from his past errors, but that clearly isn\u2019t true. A month and a couple of campaign managers later, Trump isn\u2019t just repeating the same mistakes. He has learned how to make even bigger ones.</p>",

  "<p><strong>Once upon a time there were two parents living in domestic disharmony, kept together (probably) by their adored and indulged son. The mother died and, after a few years, I came on the scene and married this father of the one-and-only son. The son and I got on well for a few years.</strong></p> <p><strong>I then discovered that his father \u2013 despite the son now being over 40 \u2013 paid a monthly sum to cover the son\u2019s psychologist\u2019s bill. It was admitted that the money was not actually being used for this purpose. I then learned that, despite having no responsibilities, the son had debts that ran into a comfortable four-figure sum. (Even though he earned a large salary.) He was also propped up by his dad when it came to paying income tax.</strong></p> <p><strong>The mindset behind this was his belief that he was entitled to his mother\u2019s money, even though her will had bequeathed it to his father, and his father had made it clear that the son would be his sole beneficiary.</strong></p> <p><strong>I was able to show that none of my four children by a previous marriage had any dependence on me, nor had expectations of inheritance. Such matters were never discussed. My husband took my point that propping up his son was counter-productive, enhancing his dependence on his dad. He stopped his monthly payments for the fictional psychologist and suggested the next income tax hand-out be a loan (which was not honoured). I am therefore vilified as responsible for having \u201cinfluenced\u201d my husband against his son.</strong></p> <p><strong>When we are together, my stepson is covertly rude to me by engaging his father in conversations in which I can have no input, but has also been overtly rude in shouting at me that I was living off his father and responsible for his mother\u2019s death. (There is no logical way in which I can be implicated.) </strong></p> <p><strong>I believe the three of us should have an easy, unselfconscious companionship, accepting each\u2019s relationship with the other. I know that my husband\u2019s view is the same. </strong></p> <p><strong>I think my stepson would ideally like to turn back the pages, push me over a cliff and resume milking his father dry. He is in a state of confused jealousy about his father re-marrying. How can I improve our relationship?</strong></p> <p>Sometimes when people want love, but feel they don\u2019t have it; they want money instead. And often when family members disagree, they have more in common than they realise.</p> <p>Your stepson does sound quite disagreeable in parts, but why does it irk you so much that he is/was so indulged by his parents? Weren\u2019t you, by yours?</p> <p>I found the side-swipe at your husband\u2019s first wife unnecessary and callous. If you are like this in real life with the son, I\u2019m not surprised he is grasping at what he can from his father. And where <em>is</em> his father exactly, in all this? Leaving you two to fight like siblings.</p> <p>I consulted a psychologist, Emma Kenny (<a href=\"http://www.bacp.co.uk/\" title=\"\">bacp.co.uk</a>). She says: \u201cWhile it would be easy to respond sympathetically by agreeing that the son is indeed a freeloader, who sees his father as a cash cow, I believe that would do both of you a disservice. It would only compound the already clear hostility.\u201d</p> <p>Families often have different approaches to money and inheritance. Some are adamant their children should get by on their own, others see leaving a monetary legacy as an act of love.</p> <p>\u201cOne of the main issues,\u201d says Kenny, \u201cseems to be your concern about money. You suggest he resents his inheritance being spent and give as an example your own children as being financially independent. This demonstrates the unhealthy competition you are creating on all sides. You\u2019ve decided your children are more capable, successful and well-adjusted than your husband\u2019s. You suggest that your own kids don\u2019t expect a penny in inheritance \u2013 how do you know? You\u2019ve never discussed it.\u201d</p> <p>You can\u2019t marry into a family and expect the children to have been parented as yours were. One way isn\u2019t right for everyone. And as Kenny points out, \u201cYour stepson\u2019s mother may have indulged her son and may well not have agreed with the parenting style that you feel is correct. Potentially, this man grew up feeling cherished and important and, when his mother died, looked to his father to continue this emotional and financial bond.\u201d</p> <p>Kenny also feels that it is his father who has allowed this \u201cbailing out\u201d to continue and that the son may view it as a \u201cphysical manifestation of love\u201d. Of course he could be a total and terrible freeloader but that is for his father to deal with. I wonder if you feel massive resentment towards your husband but it\u2019s safer to project this on to your stepson?</p> <p>\u201cStop making your stepson feel like a failure, stop acting like a detective and allow your husband to make the decisions he wishes to about his son,\u201d says Kenny. \u201cSit down as a family and agree to allow their relationship to progress as they see fit. Draw a line under your previous issues and agree to move on more positively. Stop trying to control your husband, and accept that there is room for him to love both of you. Finally, you are suggesting that money shouldn\u2019t be so important to your stepson \u2013 maybe you could lead by example.\u201d</p> <h2>Your problems solved<br></h2> <p>Contact Annalisa Barbieri, The Guardian, Kings Place, 90 York Way, London N1 9GU or email\u2008annalisa.barbieri@mac.com.

They brought useful advice and reassurance, true. But along with those came an epidemic that killed tens of thousands of babies. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/sudden-infant-death-syndrome\">Sudden infant death syndrome \u2013 Sids</a> \u2013 is always a tragedy, but it is no longer commonplace. It became an epidemic between 1970 and 1991, and, at its peak, babies in some of the world\u2019s richest countries were dying at the rate of one in every 250 live births each year. The rate in the last year for which figures were available in England and Wales only, 2013, is one in every 3,000.</p> <p>The Back to Sleep campaign, launched in 1991, changed the advice on sleeping position from front to back, and has had a public health benefit comparable to such breakthroughs as the moment Victorian epidemiologist John Snow <a href=\"http://www.choleraandthethames.co.uk\">took the handle off the Soho water pump in 1854</a> and stopped a cholera outbreak in its tracks.</p> <p>At the centre of the Sids revolution was Bristol doctor Peter Fleming. He is now semi-retired, but is currently exploring a link between subtle features of the newborn hearing test and arousal mechanisms that might answer the grievous unsolved riddle of why Sids happens.</p> <p>In 1978 Fleming, who had qualified in Bristol, returned from a job at the Toronto children\u2019s hospital in Canada with funding from the US National Institutes of Health that enabled him to set up his own respiratory lab. He wanted to look in particular at the relationship between breathing and temperature control in infants.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a921a09d07f12da6dc9726947e937dc6d92cdcbb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a921a09d07f12da6dc9726947e937dc6d92cdcbb/0_248_4368_2621/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Prof Peter Fleming, whose research in the 1980s was crucial to the reduction of Sids death rates\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Prof Peter Fleming, whose research in the 1980s was crucial to the reduction of Sids death rates.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Martin Godwin/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Fleming is both very clever \u2013 he has a PhD in nonlinear mathematical modelling, AKA chaos theory \u2013 and very humane. When he found that Bristol offered no counselling or support for families whose baby had died unexpectedly, he began to offer it himself. He saw the families in the emergency department and later in their homes and told them what was known \u2013 and how much was unknown \u2013 about what was then still widely called cot death.</p> <p>\u201cLots of people still thought that the parents must be at fault in some way if their baby had died. They were made to feel very guilty. I wanted to get support, and information, to these families.\u201d</p> <p>The progress in public understanding is reflected in the change of terminology. When it was called cot death it was considered primarily a social problem, a parental failure that still carried a hint of the most unnatural of crimes, infanticide. When it became sudden infant death syndrome (or sudden unexplained/unexpected infant death syndrome, SUID), it became a medical problem that was capable of scientific resolution.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/11/the-guardian-view-on-a-public-health-triumph-the-numbers-say-it-all\">The Guardian view on a public health triumph: the numbers say it all | Editorial</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Early in the 1970s, a US congressional committee called it \u201cone of the last great unresolved childhood catastrophes\u201d and announced federal funding. Meanwhile, bereaved parents were organising too. In 1971 the Foundation for the Study of Infant Deaths was set up in the UK by a grandmother determined to explain her grandson\u2019s death. (It recently rebranded itself as <a href=\"http://www.lullabytrust.org.uk/history-of-the-charity\">The Lullaby Trust</a>, because it believed its previous name was too austere and off-putting.) A decade later there was an international federation of similar organisations. In 1984, Fleming, working closely with the trust, set up the Avon infant mortality programme.</p> <p>\u201cI didn\u2019t look at the sleeping position. But in 1987, with two colleagues, I started a temperature and infection study, and we did include the sleeping position, because scientists in the Netherlands and Australia had no data but they did have a lot of careful observation that made them think it was important.\u201d Far from starting his study <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_equipoise\">in equipoise</a>, with a mind open to every possibility, Fleming only considered the sleeping position question in order to exclude it.</p> <p>There were no immediately definitive results. \u201cIt was incremental. Very few things are ever black and white. It is rarely clear-cut. It is about changing the risk,\u201d Fleming says. This is why the maths matters. \u201cYou have to try <a href=\"http://www.ted.com/talks/eric_berlow_how_complexity_leads_to_simplicity?language=en\">to understand complexity</a>. You have to see whether a small change can make a difference.\u201d</p> <p>It helped that, like many of the Bristol families whose experiences were central to Fleming\u2019s research, he came from a working-class family. He grew up in Medway in Kent, where his father worked in the naval dockyard and his mother in the office of a local factory.</p> <p>For his study, Fleming and his team talked to the bereaved families as soon as possible after the death, to gather information about the baby and the family, what they normally did, what might have been different \u2013 all the variables that might have influenced the outcome. He promised the families that they would know the results of his research before it was published: \u201cIt\u2019s really important that the people involved feel they own the work. It is a collaborative effort. I want to work with people, not instruct them.\u201d</p> <p>GPs, midwives and health visitors were all involved. If a GP got a call about a dead or an unresponsive baby, their next call would be to Fleming. \u201cI spent a lot of time with just-bereaved families in council houses. It didn\u2019t bother me, because I was not inclined to see them as different from myself.\u201d</p> <p>Over the next two years, he and his team gathered data from 70 bereaved families, and from another 140 families whose babies had been born very close to the time of a Sids baby. The control group were identified by asking the health visitor for the details of the two babies next on their list. They were \u201cthe babies next door\u201d. \u201cThere was 99% collaboration from the families,\u201d Fleming said. \u201cPeople were very, very positive about wanting to do something.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/belief/2013/apr/26/brother-died-cot-death-giles-fraser\">My brother died from a cot death before I was born. Yet I still miss him | Giles Fraser</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The team was confident that their population-based study, with a control group drawn from the same population, at the same time, was as close as possible to achieving the holy grail of true comparability. Yet despite their confidence in the robustness of their data, presenting the preliminary results at the first ever meeting of the <a href=\"http://\">International Society for the Prevention and Investigation of Perinatal and Infant Deaths</a> in March 1989 was a nerve-racking moment. Fleming\u2019s findings were received by his knowledgeable audience with incredulity. \u201cThey could not accept that something so simple could be so important,\u201d he says.</p> <p>It was like being asked to believe two impossible things before breakfast. Here was a non-medical intervention that could, for no clear reason, stop babies dying of a syndrome that was also unexplained. But Fleming believed it himself. And when he went back to do a bigger study in Bristol, he found that health professionals who already knew of his findings were advising all new mothers to put their babies on their back to sleep.</p> <p>Understandably, bereaved families whose babies died after Fleming\u2019s first study believe his results should have been publicised at once. But \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/the-national-institute-for-health-and-care-excellence-nice\">Nice [the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence]</a> would have laughed at my research. They want things done properly \u2013 randomised control trials and all that sort of thing. It wasn\u2019t enough to convince scientific colleagues, and it certainly wouldn\u2019t meet the standards for any public health campaign,\u201d he says.</p> <p>Fleming published his paper in the British Medical Journal and went back to do more research. Soon, a New Zealand study [<a href=\"https://www.hqsc.govt.nz/assets/CYMRC/NEMR/SIDS-prevention-Mitchell-Blair-NZMJ-2012.pdf\">pdf download</a>] produced similar findings. The quest now was for evidence with which to argue for a new public health campaign. Unable to conduct a study with a bigger sample in Bristol because newborns were no longer being put to sleep on their fronts as a result of his first findings, instead Fleming found himself conducting a self-initiated, population-wide observational study of newborn babies sleeping on their backs. As his first study predicted, the number of Sids deaths fell from around one a week to less than one a month, and then to just three a year. While he was in the midst of the long process of getting this study published in the Lancet, another family\u2019s tragedy tipped the whole project into the headlines.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"77c84cb84c5c9d1e5e1a689fe7b0418178c65408\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/77c84cb84c5c9d1e5e1a689fe7b0418178c65408/173_850_2393_2989/801.jpg\" alt=\"Anne Diamond\" width=\"801\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Anne Diamond, whose four-month-old son died in 1991.

Diamond\u2019s response was to use all her fame and journalistic experience to investigate what people knew about why it had happened. When she met Fleming, and learned of the findings in the Avon and New Zealand studies, she marched on the Department of Health.</p> <p>She galvanised the health secretary, Viriginia Bottomley, into accepting the need for a strong public health message. In December 1991 the Back to Sleep campaign was launched. Sids deaths in the UK fell instantly, and with astonishing speed. In 1989 there were 1,545 Sids deaths. Now there are barely 200 a year.</p> <p>The Sids epidemic can be dated from the time it first appeared on death certificates in 1970, until the public health campaign in 1991. In Britain alone, it probably cost 10,000 lives. It is still hard to explain how it happened. The first recorded advice to put babies to sleep on their front is from 1943. Dr Spock changed his advice to recommend front sleeping between the first and second editions of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2013/dec/02/parenting-childcare-books-babies-children\">his famous handbook</a> in 1955.</p> <p>Some studies associate the syndrome with the rise of the parenting expert, others with the industrialisation of baby care that turned it into a round of bottle-feeding and rigid routines. Others point to the fading respect for culture and experience. The only medical evidence for the benefit of front sleeping came from studies of very premature babies who are still put face down; but even they are never now sent home until they can breathe well enough to prosper on their backs. It was a tragic lesson in the danger of taking a small, sick subset of a population and extrapolating a public health message for well babies.</p> <p>The architectural writer <a href=\"http://www.gilliandarley.com/writing-2/john-soane-an-accidental-romantic/\">Gillian Darley</a> lost her son Joseph when he was 11 weeks old, during a midday sleep on a cold, murky day in early April nearly 30 years ago. \u201cI was visiting a friend. He was in his moses basket. I don\u2019t remember being told what to do, it was just what everyone did,\u201d she says. \u201cIt was received wisdom. The underlying thing is \u2013 like those terrible stories of children who disappear on their gap year and whose bodies are never found \u2013 the lack of closure. It\u2019s not a constant presence, but if it was possible to say what was the trigger, it would take a whole load off my subconscious.\u201d</p> <p>Understanding that trigger is no closer. But the risk factors are now well understood: maternal smoking and co-sleeping. No one questions the former. Co-sleeping, however, has become the subject of intense controversy, not least because warnings of the dangers of taking babies into their parents\u2019 beds has led some mothers to choose instead to nurse babies on sofas, where accidents such as suffocation are more likely. Fleming believes the direct risk from co-sleeping is very small, but the Lullaby Trust takes the view that, like advertising, public health cannot do complexity, and so continues to warn against co-sleeping.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/jul/03/sudden-infant-death-syndrome-avoid-sharing-bed-nice\">Sharing bed with baby in first year may raise risk of sudden infant death</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Sids was once a curse that struck randomly across classes.

  "<p>Myra Crimmel woke up the morning of 7 September 2013 covered in cuts and bruises, her body sore. She had no idea how she ended up on the balcony of her UC Santa Barbara dorm. Or why she was naked \u2013 and with an older student and his friend. She guessed that they had drugged her. Over the next few hours, she claims, they would rape her in the shower and on her room-mate\u2019s bed.</p> <p>Months later, Crimmel filed a complaint against her college with the US Department of Education\u2019s office of civil rights. <a href=\"http://endrapeoncampus.org/\">End Rape on Campus</a>, an advocacy group that helped Crimmel and another woman from another school publicize their complaints, noted that both of their attacks occurred at about the same point in the school year. Crimmel and the other woman \u201chope to join over 70 colleges nationwide undergoing federal gender discrimination probes,\u201d a press release read, \u201cand to call attention to the \u2018red zone\u2019\u201d.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>For colleges which undertake sexual assault prevention as part of orientation, their efforts may be coming too late</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The \u201cred zone\u201d is shorthand for the time at the beginning of the school year when a disproportionate number of campus sexual assaults take place. The Department of Justice has identified the period between students\u2019 arrival on campus in late August and Thanksgiving break as the stretch of time when a student is more likely to be assaulted than at any other point in her college career. During that time, the majority of assaults occur between midnight and 6am, on Saturday and Sunday mornings.</p> <p>Other research suggests the red zone is even more concentrated, and that assaults spike in the days before the school year officially begins. At colleges which undertake sexual assault prevention as part of freshman orientation, this means their efforts may be coming too late.</p> <p>Some of the theories that prevail in explaining the red zone are unsurprising. The red zone overlaps with a battery of back-to-school parties, where freshmen with little drinking experience and few friends to watch out for them are at their most vulnerable. In response, hundreds of colleges will spend the early weeks of this school year telling women how to avoid being preyed upon or requiring students to complete a short anti-violence tutorial.</p> <p>But a growing number of activists, researchers, and sexual assault prevention experts insist the usual methods are also least likely to work. </p> <p>\u201cFor so, so long we have tried to cram every little piece of violence prevention in a 45-minutes-or-less presentation to incoming freshmen,\u201d said Darcie Folsom, the director of sexual violence prevention and advocacy at Connecticut College. \u201cAnd it has not been the most successful.\u201d The red zone, many of them say, is a disquieting symbol \u2013 and perhaps even a result \u2013 of everything that\u2019s wrong with traditional approaches to preventing sexual assault.</p> <p>\u201cWe don\u2019t even use the term \u2018red zone\u2019,\u201d said Lea Hegge, who is a trainer for a nonprofit, <a href=\"https://www.livethegreendot.com/\">the Green Dot</a>, which runs programs to deter sexual assault. The reason, she said, is that campuses aware that they have a red zone problem have tended, historically, to respond primarily with tips for avoiding assault. \u201cIt encourages this idea that there is a most dangerous time on campus, and if you only follow a list of what not to do in order to not get assaulted, you won\u2019t [\u2026] It\u2019s putting the onus on the victim for preventing their own assault.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The term 'red zone' encourages this idea that there is a most dangerous time on campus</p> <footer> <cite>Lea Hegge</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Looking back, Crimmel says her story is a brutal illustration of this \u2013 of why telling women to prevent their own rapes isn\u2019t effective. She followed the rules that supposedly safeguard a woman from being assaulted, she says, staying with friends and within familiar surroundings. \u201cIf you had asked me before it happened, could this happen? I bet I would say, \u2018Well I can look out for myself,\u2019\u201d she recalls. <br></p> <p>Additionally, she claimed in her complaint that with its lackluster investigations of campus assault, her school had created an environment in which sexual violence was more or less tolerated.</p> <p>The red zone, say advocates and researchers, is the result of many of these same factors. It persists where there is a history of apathy or even subtle tolerance toward sexual assault. It involves people who may be vulnerable for reasons beyond their control, and predators who know so. </p> <p>\u201cThe people who are facilitating sex assault on college campuses are aware of who they can take advantage of,\u201d said Hegge.</p> <p>Notably, \u201cred zone\u201d poses a particular danger to incoming freshmen. One study concluded that freshmen were two and a half times as likely as students in other years to be the victims of assault, a number which increased for rapes occurring at parties. \u201cThe take-home was, no matter how you break it down, no matter how you look at the statistics, freshmen are more likely to be the targets of predatory behavior, always,\u201d said Lisa Wade, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/23/sex-on-campus-hookup-culture-student-journals\">a researcher who has studied sexual activity on campus</a>.</p> <p>A host of realities intertwine to make freshmen particularly vulnerable targets, including many outside anyone\u2019s control. They are new to campus, with few social ties, eager to fit in, and possibly drinking alcohol for the first time. Reacting to these factors, police and administrators often issue familiar suggestions for how to avoid being the victim of sexual assault: don\u2019t walk home alone at night. Go to parties with a group. Keep your drink in your possession.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>If we keep asking students not to do something that\u2019s completely normal to them, we will keep getting the same result</p> <footer> <cite>Barbara McCall</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Many administrators are beginning to conclude that this advice is useless, or at least useless by itself.</p> <p>\u201cIf we keep asking young students not to do something that\u2019s completely, developmentally normal to them, we will keep getting the same result,\u201d says Barbara McCall, the director of health and wellness education at Middlebury College. \u201cIt\u2019s not a theory. It\u2019s reality.\u201d</p> <p>That\u2019s not for lack of young women trying to heed it. At Penn State, Katie Tenny, a coordinator involved in reducing sexual assault, previously was a health educator in the university\u2019s risky-drinking reduction program. \u201cA lot of times, girls would talk about how they watched out for each other,\u201d she recalls. \u201cHow they had plans going into the evening,\u201d such as, stay together, keep an eye on your roommate, and leave with the same friends you arrived with.</p> <p>Somehow, though, the plans always seemed to break down. Crimmel herself has seen it happen. Once, at a party, she watched a man try to thwart a freshman woman\u2019s attempts to rejoin the group she came in with. \u201cThe guy said, \u2018You just met your room-mate two days ago, how do you know she\u2019s your friend?\u2019\u201d Crimmel recalled. \u201cThey use the fact that you\u2019re in a new place. They know the right words to tear you away.\u201d</p> <p>Normally, an administrator like Tenny might advocate for even stronger messaging of prevention toward young women. But Penn State and a handful of other colleges are attempting to emphasize a new approach, one in which they hardly focus on underclassmen. Instead, they lean on popular upperclassmen to intervene if they recognize signs of predatory behavior, putting the onus of preventing assault on those who are the least inherently vulnerable to its menace. Green Dot epitomizes this approach. </p> <p>Influential seniors and juniors \u201care much more likely to influence the values of the campus than I am standing in front of a room of 600 students\u201d, said McCall. \u201cIt helps us create a sustainable culture change, with the hope that we create an institution that doesn\u2019t tolerate acts of violence.\u201d</p> <p>Crimmel says a culture shift couldn\u2019t come sooner. \u201cPeople need to know that you aren\u2019t a man if you rape a girl,\u201d she said. On the Monday after her assaults, she says, she went to the school nurse for an examination. The nurse said she saw women who had been assaulted nearly every Monday. \u201cIt\u2019s not just me, it\u2019s not just my school,\u201d Crimmel said. \u201cIt happens in each school in America.\u201d</p>",

  "<p>When I was 15 years old, in September 2004, I went to Sunday mass at my local church in Fond du Lac, Wisconsin, with my mother as I usually did. During the service a bat started flying around the church and members of the congregation began flapping at it. An usher eventually hit it with a prayer book and it fell to the floor. I could see it was only stunned, so, being an animal lover, I asked my mum if I could take it outside. I picked it up by its wings and it began screeching, so I hurried out. As I went to throw it into a bush it sank its fangs into my left finger and I felt a sharp pain. When we got home my mother dressed the wound.</p> <p>My dad wasn\u2019t pleased, but no one thought anything more about it. Three weeks later I noticed my left finger felt a bit numb, with some tingling, too. Within a couple of days I felt tired and nauseous. We thought I had flu. About 24 hours later I had double vision and my family took me to hospital. By the time I got there I was semi-delirious and vomiting. I was asked to stand on one leg, but I couldn\u2019t keep my balance. They began tests but couldn\u2019t find anything.</p> <p>Then we mentioned the bat bite. I was taken to the children\u2019s hospital, where rabies was diagnosed. At that point my memory is virtually blank. I later learned that I began producing masses of saliva and my arm started jerking. My parents were told I had hours to live.</p> <p>No one had ever survived rabies without a vaccination, but Dr Rodney Willoughby, a paediatrician and infectious disease specialist at the hospital, decided he had to do something. He consulted various books and used his experience to come up with an impromptu treatment. He made it clear he had no idea whether it would work and that there might be many other complications as a result, but my parents agreed to give it a go.</p> <p>I was put into a coma to isolate my brain and allow my immune system to fight the virus. I was also given ketamine to protect my brain, another drug to reduce its side effects and two antiviral medicines.</p> <p>A week later they slowly brought me out of the coma. I was too weak to open my eyes but when Dr Willoughby held my eyelids open and told me to look over at my mum, I did. Mum was elated because it showed that I was still \u201cin there\u201d. I had become the first known person ever to survive rabies without a vaccination; the treatment became known as the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milwaukee_protocol\">Milwaukee protocol</a>.</p> <p>I spent 11 weeks in hospital, where I had to take 17 pills a day to help my recovery. I felt lucky to be alive but I was frustrated, isolated and desperate to go home. The whole left side of my body was affected, I had balance issues and my speech was badly impaired. Rehabilitation took months. It was so slow to begin with that I despaired that I\u2019d never recover.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/jul/01/i-inject-myself-with-snake-venom-experience\">Experience: I inject myself with snake venom</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Over a decade on, every day is another day of therapy for me; my speech is still slightly affected and I have to maintain physical exercises because even now one side of my body reacts more slowly than the other. Otherwise I am healthy. I became a kennel assistant, and I\u2019m ambassador for the <a href=\"https://rabiesalliance.org/\">Global Alliance for Rabies Control</a>. I found it hard to think about what happened initially because I had come so close to death but now I give talks about the disease to raise awareness.</p> <p>Dr Willoughby is now a family friend and I invited him to my wedding two years ago. He says that the day I looked over at my mum from my bed was one of the happiest of his life.</p> <p>Oddly, I had another brush with rabies two years ago. I keep huskies, and I went out to feed them one morning and found a dead bat in their cage. I had it tested and it proved positive for rabies; the dogs had to be vaccinated. Less than 1% of bats are rabid, so it was really disturbing. But I don\u2019t have a problem with bats. I even go to bat festivals where there are educational talks and presentations.</p> <p>I feel so grateful for my survival and the life I\u2019ve had since the bite. I don\u2019t take anything for granted. Four months ago, when I gave birth to twins, it felt like a triumph.</p> <p>\u2022 As told to Mike Pattenden.</p> <p>Do you have an experience to share?

  "<p>There\u2019s an old Irving Berlin song about soldiers marching, with one individual careering all over the shop. His fond mama: \u201cThey were all out of step but Jim.\u201d I&#xa0;was that Jim when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2014/oct/12/the-palomar-restaurant-review-jay-rayner\">The Palomar</a> hit&#xa0;London. Everyone <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2014/oct/12/the-palomar-restaurant-review-jay-rayner\">loved it</a> but me: I&#xa0;thought the food over-seasoned, tiny-portioned, sloppy, the welcome chilly (one pal wasn\u2019t allowed to sit until the rest of us arrived), the raw bar tired. Most of all, I&#xa0;hated the chefs-as-zany-performers shtick. It was the living incarnation of \u201cYou don\u2019t have to be&#xa0;mad to work here, but it helps.\u201d I&#xa0;once worked in a restaurant where the \u201chighlight\u201d of the evening was when the head chef (a short, gropey misogynist) issued from the kitchen with his team of scrofulous cohorts to bang pots with spoons to Bob Marley\u2019s Exodus. It has clearly scarred me for life.</p> <p>So I\u2019ve been dragging my feet about checking out its new sibling, <a href=\"http://thebarbary.co.uk\">The Barbary</a>. Who needs that kind of attitude? You can probably tell where I\u2019m going with this: obviously, I love it. Sure, it\u2019s plagued with all the contemporary tropes: yawn, bare brick; yawn, neon; yawn, reclaimed floor tiles and raw plaster walls. And&#xa0;we\u2019re sitting on backless stools around an open \u201ckitchen bar\u201d. But the chefs are behaving like chefs and&#xa0;the food they\u2019re cranking out is utterly glorious. Plus, it\u2019s quite thrillingly alien: I love a menu where you\u2019ve only the shakiest idea of what\u2019s on offer. We\u2019re told The Barbary\u2019s menu reflects the former Barbary Coast (Morocco, Algeria, Libya and Tunisia), which translates into a series of lyrical culinary arcana: mashawsha, sharabik, tcheba, zuzu and the magnificent nishnushim.</p> <p>The food more than lives up to the&#xa0;intrigue of the language: the mashawsha delivers a muscular tentacle of octopus coiled around a&#xa0;slick of pomegranate molasses and the titular hot, garlicky, lemony chickpeas (described earlier on the menu as msabacha, just to confuse us further). It\u2019s charred on the robata grill until almost toffee-crisp outside and pillowy within: gorgeous. A daily special of smoky, grilled bavette steak is as colourful as it is hugely flavoured \u2013 pickled red onion, a flourish of parsley and the luminous yellow of amba, a sauce based on pickled mango spiked with the reek of fenugreek.</p> <p>The menu waxes a bit banterific with fattoush salad (\u201cYeah,&#xa0;baby!\u201d), but I\u2019ll forgive because it\u2019s a fabulous thing: ruby, sweet tomatoes; clouds of whipped feta; crisp, heavily oiled croutons; and a&#xa0;sharp, seductive dressing humming with sumac. I\u2019d even give it a \u201cshagadelic\u201d. Vegetables have a starring role: baba ganoush, as silky and smoky as a 1940s matinee idol, is rich with tahini. There\u2019s cauliflower \u2013 of course there is \u2013 this one \u201cJaffa style\u201d, which turns out to be deep-fried and scattered with a coriander-laced tomato salsa: it\u2019s enough to gladden any meat-avoider\u2019s heart.</p> <p>The baked goods are none too shabby, either. Arayes (under nishnushim or \u201csnacks\u201d) \u2013 pockets of pitta stuffed with spiced lamb, almost blackened at the edges \u2013 are served with thick yoghurt and harissa: celestial sausage rolls. We sponge up sauces with naan e barbari, a puffy, simple flatbread, smoky, blistered and slick with olive oil, closely related to its Indian namesake \u2013 and, yes, that\u2019s a tandoor oven it\u2019s fished out of. But my greatest love is reserved for the \u201cJerusalem bagel\u201d: a large coil of the most blissfully chewy white bread, boiled and baked, crusted with oily sesame seeds with za\u2019atar for dunking. This, with the restaurant\u2019s tongue-tingling zhug (green chilli sauce) and a glass of Lebanese Massaya ros\u00e9, well, if I choked eating it, I\u2019d basically die happy.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/aug/05/the-frog-london-e1-restaurant-review-marina-oloughlin\">The Frog, London E1: \u2018I can\u2019t shake the feeling that this is a rather silly restaurant\u2019 \u2013 restaurant review | Marina O\u2019Loughlin</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The pal reminds me that the owners are from a nightclub background and the sound system is&#xa0;evidence of real investment: there\u2019s music, but you can hear yourself think.

  "<p>Legal and constitutional questions have been raised over revelations that the Baltimore police department used privately contracted surveillance technology to secretly monitor vast swaths of the city, lawyers and civil liberties advocates say.</p> <p>The program, confirmed for the first time by police officials on Wednesday, allows a small plane to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/24/baltimore-police-aerial-surveillance-cameras\">film a 32 square mile section of the city</a>. The tape is saved and stored and analysts can move about in time and space in order to track vehicles or individuals, although individual human characteristics aren\u2019t discernible.

And police spokesman TJ Smith said the technology has been central in several arrests.</p> <p>Finegar said arrests that relied on the surveillance could be subject to legal challenge.<br></p> <p> \u201c\u2018If you\u2019re walking down the street and see a blue light camera and it\u2019s been publicly discussed and there were hearings about it, then you understand that you could be being videotaped. But if you have a Cessna flying up out of sight on random days with a 32-mile radius, then it starts to become what legal analysts call \u2018aggregate data\u2019 and that has not been held up by some of the appellate courts.\u201d</p> <p>Shahid Buttar, a constitutional lawyer with the Electronic Frontier Foundation, said the law hasn\u2019t even yet \u201cevolved to reach these circumstances\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThe court is only now grappling with these kinds of mass surveillance technologies, and the supreme court at least has never ruled on a case like this,\u201d said Buttar. \u201cIt\u2019s not the case that this is legal.

Or are they going \u2026 to try to say that is not discoverable material, it\u2019s not in the hands of the state?\u201d</p> <p>Finegar faces a practical problem: her office has no way of knowing which cases the technology was used in or what role it played in an investigation. </p> <p>\u201cIt feels less like an investigative tool and like a potential for big brotherhood,\u201d Finegar said. \u201cIt really needs to be regulated and it needs to be openly discussed.\u201d</p> <p>It was the city public defender\u2019s office that uncovered earlier this year the details of the police department\u2019s use of another form of surveillance, Stingray technology, which uses cellphone data to locate individuals without a warrant. </p> <p>Last April, Maryland\u2019s second highest court ruled that using Stingray to obtain warrants was unconstitutional, calling into question hundreds of cases.</p> <p>The city council has said it will hold a hearing about the program next month. \u201cThe commissioner keeps talking about transparency, but every time we turn around, there\u2019s something else where we\u2019re left on the outside,\u201d councilman Warren Branch told the Baltimore <a href=\"http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/baltimore-city/bs-md-ci-surveillance-folo-20160825-story.html\">Sun</a> on Thursday.</p> <p><em>With reporting by Ciara McCarthy</em></p> <p><br></p>",

  "<p>Steven Defour\u2019s tattoos are a clue to the mind of the player who, at \u00a37.5m, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/aug/16/burnley-sign-steven-defour-anderlecht\" title=\"\">is Burnley\u2019s record signing</a>.

A player many believed to be in the class Manchester City\u2019s Kevin De Bruyne now occupies, the midfielder\u2019s progress was hampered by injury and off-field distractions, which have included a difficult personal life and an uneven approach to training.</p> <p>On the pitch Defour thrives, particularly when faced with the hostility a controversial career has caused. Another phrase on one of the 28-year-old\u2019s arms sums up the boy from Mechelen. \u201cVoluntas vincendi maior timore perdendi\u201d \u2013 \u201cThe will to win is greater than the fear of losing.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/jan/25/anderlecht-steven-defour-standard-liege-banner\">Anderlecht\u2019s Steven Defour sees red over Standard Li\u00e8ge fans\u2019 banner</a> </p> </aside>  <p>This self-determination has proved vital. At 16 Defour was the <em>wunderkind</em> handed a debut at Genk by Ren\u00e9 Vandereycken, who later did the same when becoming Belgium coach. A year later Defour was a first-choice and when Ajax expressed a serious interest in the summer of 2006, his first divisive decision followed. Defour invoked a law that allows footballers in Belgium to terminate contracts for a fee. A gentlemen\u2019s agreement among clubs means this rarely occurs and so Defour provoked ill-feeling and, more materially, made Ajax back away from the transfer.</p> <p>Instead he joined Standard Li\u00e8ge, which still upsets Genk supporters, and when Defour\u2019s new club played Genk in August that year fans pelted eggs at the team bus, and vicious chants were aimed at the player. His response was to step off the bus first, offer a broad smile, then turn in an impressive display.</p> <p>Renowned for being fiery, Defour maintained his cool. Even when Genk\u2019s Tom Soetaers administered an industrial tackle on an ankle, the cold-eyed calm remained. \u201cFrankly,\u201d Defour said, \u201cI was expecting much worse. I liked it.\u201d</p> <p>In private Defour is likeable, though he can find privacy difficult. At his wedding in 2011 he and his bride asked the paparazzi to stay away and felt moved to hide behind umbrellas as they arrived. Later, Defour could not resist a joke: he posed with a brolly for an interview shortly after the ceremony.</p> <p>The wedding (Defour is now divorced) was front-page news in Belgium and he has often featured on the gossip pages. His parents separated when he was young and his relationship with them has not always been smooth. Defour\u2019s father, Jacques, was a footballer but his career ended after he broke a leg on his debut. Despite this, Defour Sr drove his son towards becoming a professional and has often been emotional in public during the highs and lows of his career.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/aug/20/burnley-liverpool-premier-league-match-report\">Burnley and Sam Vokes catch Liverpool cold as Klopp\u2019s men fire blanks</a> </p> </aside>  <p>At Li\u00e8ge, Defour\u2019s edge was honed by playing alongside S\u00e9rgio Con\u00e7eic\u00e3o. The Portuguese\u2019s CV included the <em>scudetto</em> at Lazio and the Cup Winners\u2019 Cup. He was also a three-time league champion at Porto. At 19, Luciano D\u2019Onofrio, the Li\u00e8ge manager, made Defour captain, though calf and shoulder injuries troubled him.</p> <p>Yet by May 2009, the midfielder had won two Belgian championships \u2013 the first broke Li\u00e8ge\u2019s 25-year drought \u2013 a domestic cup, the golden shoe, as the nation\u2019s finest player, and was an international of three years.</p> <p>Defour also operated in tandem with Marouane Fellaini before the latter left for Everton in September 2008 \u2013 and was considered the team\u2019s driving force. But he then broke a foot, causing Sir Alex Ferguson to write a letter to him in September 2009. It read: \u201cI am going to pay attention as to how you are progressing and I am going to get in touch with your club to get the information on your recovery.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"71d11602554be4c6d71d5dd685a20fd18e5f2b2a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/71d11602554be4c6d71d5dd685a20fd18e5f2b2a/0_259_4928_2957/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Liege\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Standard Li\u00e8ge fans display their contempt for Steven Defour on his return with Anderlecht in 2015.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Yorick Jansens/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Ferguson\u2019s interest faded and Defour moved to Porto in 2011. There he won the title twice in his first two seasons, played in the Champions League and, in total, made 111 appearances before returning to Belgium in 2014.</p> <p>This again caused friction as he signed for Anderlecht, Li\u00e8ge\u2019s fierce rivals. Defour\u2019s status at his former club fell to pariah and caused a graphic banner to be unfurled when he returned to the Stade Maurice Dufrasne in Anderlecht colours. \u201cRED OR DEAD\u201d <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/jan/25/anderlecht-steven-defour-standard-liege-banner\" title=\"\">it read and featured Defour\u2019s severed head</a> being clutched by a masked figure holding a machete in the other hand.</p> <p>That was last year. By then Defour had lost his place with Belgium having been in the 2014 World Cup squad, although he was Friday selected in Roberto Mart\u00ednez\u2019s first Belgium squad for the upcoming matches against Spain and Cyprus.</p> <p>He had also fallen out with a section of the Anderlecht fans \u2013 causing them to hurl beer at him \u2013 leading to the move to Burnley, one that offers some respite.</p> <p>The transfer came close to not happening though. Twelve years into an attritional career, Defour was tempted by a more lucrative offer to join Abu Dhabi\u2019s Al Jazira. While the player will earn around \u00a31.5m per season at Turf Moor \u2013 his biggest ever salary \u2013 Jazira offered markedly more.</p> <p>But the intervention of Sean Dyche helped convince Defour, the Burnley manager having been impressed with the player after watching him during Anderlecht\u2019s 5-1 victory over KV Kortrijk and then having a face-to-face meeting. Daily contact by phone followed and this month the deal was agreed.</p> <p>The challenge for Defour is to make&#xa0;his mark in the Premier League having also made the transition from attacking midfielder to spiky holding player. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/aug/20/burnley-liverpool-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">In last Saturday\u2019s 2-0 win</a> over Liverpool at Turf Moor he made a bright&#xa0;start, creating Andre Gray\u2019s second. \u201cOnce we get his physicality right then I think he\u2019ll be a good asset for us,\u201d Dyche said.</p>",

  "<p>Playing for the first time at a great club like Fabric will always be a special moment, but playing there on the opening Saturday and meeting your future wife that night make it an extra special place for me. I proposed to her a few months later on the same dancefloor at midnight on 31 Dec 1999.</p> <p>When my in-laws, a retired headmaster and French teacher, wanted to see what I did for a living, the staff at the club opened the VIP room especially for them, gave them a bottle of champagne on the house and escorted them down to the DJ booth. My mother-in-law loved dancing there: \u201cIt\u2019s so dark no one can see how old I am!\u201d</p> <p>Then there were the many times I turned up at 10pm to play the warm-up set in room 1, only to find managing director Keith Reilly playing his bag of records with all the enthusiasm of a kid with a new toy. Fabric is no ordinary club.</p> <p>But even though this feels personal there are wider issues that go beyond one club in EC1 that is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/aug/11/fabric-london-nightclub-close-weekend-deaths-teenagers\" title=\"\">currently shut</a> with its <a href=\"https://www.change.org/p/save-london-s-nightlife-stop-the-closure-of-fabric\" title=\"\">future looking uncertain</a> following two tragic deaths and the suspension of its licence. Over the past 10 years we have lost nearly <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/newsbeat/article/33713015/uk-nightclubs-closing-at-alarming-rate-industry-figures-suggest\" title=\"\">50%</a> of our club spaces. The change in licensing laws has meant the free entry bar has affected paid entry to nightclubs, as has the rise of festivals, but spiralling rents, intransigent councils and avaricious developers have also played a part.</p> <p>Nightclubs can be liberating, transformative spaces. For gay men and women, a nightclub is often the first step they make into a safe space as they come out. Nightclubs have been the motor that has driven the best of British fashion for over 30 years. Great clubs \u2013 and DJs \u2013 can define the sound of a city. Bristol, with its bass-heavy sound, produced Massive Attack, Tricky, Portishead and Roni Size. Glasgow\u2019s fierce electronic eclecticism is a direct product of the Sub Club, Optimo and the sadly <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/theatreblog/2015/jun/10/arches-glasgow-theatre-closure\" title=\"\">recently closed Arches</a>.</p> <p>Of course, they are also great places to go and get hammered or pull, but nightclubs have been responsible for transforming previously unloved urban areas. Fabric (and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/aug/13/what-happened-to-the-great-london-nightclubs\" title=\"\">Turnmills</a>, also now closed) brought life to soporific Clerkenwell, a place where it had previously been impossible to buy a bottle of water late at night without breaking into a shop. Now it hums with activity. The recently <a href=\"http://www.factmag.com/2016/04/11/dance-tunnel-club-london-closing/\" title=\"\">closed Dance Tunnel</a> and its sister venue Dalston Superstore performed the same function in E8, while Peckham\u2019s Bussey Building is the fulcrum of a newly buzzing scene in south-east London. Most importantly they are incubators for new musical styles and movements. From disco to hip-hop and house, there is not a single genre of dance music that would exist today without without the testing ground of the nightclub dancefloor. Given the fact that we export far more music than steel or cars these days, it should be valued and cherished.</p> <p>Governments and arts councils fall over themselves to lavish grants fatter than a diva\u2019s waistline on opera, but anything remotely connected to the black community, from jazz to electronic music, is either starved or derided. In 1985, in the wake of inner-city riots, government minister Oliver Letwin urged Margaret Thatcher not to give money to black businessmen, claiming <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/the-5-most-shocking-quotes-in-oliver-letwins-racist-memo-a6790551.html\" title=\"\">\u201cnew entrepreneurs will set up in the disco and drug trade\u201d.</a> More recently, a government spokesman <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/newsbeat/article/33713015/uk-nightclubs-closing-at-alarming-rate-industry-figures-suggest\" title=\"\">told the BBC</a>: \u201cThe current regulations strike a fair balance between making sure we have music entertainment for the public and preventing crime and disorder, whilst keeping the public safe.\u201d</p> <p>Drug-taking is endemic in British society and there\u2019s not a shred of evidence anywhere to suggest closing nightclubs will somehow either lower drug harm or eliminate consumption. It\u2019s a smokescreen for a drug policy that has consistently failed over a 50-year period. Short of performing a colonoscopy on every clubber, it\u2019s impossible to eliminate all drug use in clubs (and, indeed, anywhere else). Only last December, Fabric\u2019s drug policy was described by district judge Allison as a <a href=\"https://www.fabriclondon.com/blog/view/newsflash-update-from-the-fabric-team\" title=\"\">\u201cbeacon of best practice\u201d</a>. Given the fact that drugs are rife in prison, where theoretically some form of security exists, what chance do clubs have to control this issue?</p> <p>We could be bold, like <a href=\"http://www.citymetric.com/politics/how-could-londons-new-night-tsar-improve-city-2125\" title=\"\">Amsterdam</a> and Berlin, which regard nightlife not as a social disorder issue but a tourist attraction.</p> <p>Or we could be like New York, where neoliberal policies have all but destroyed what was once the most musically innovative and vital club scene in the world. If we want our cities to be modern, vital, vibrant, inclusive spaces that are available to everyone and not just a gaggle of oligarchs, we need to save Fabric.</p>",
  "<p>We\u2019ve reached the halfway point of the 2016 regular season in the Canadian Football League. It\u2019s been an eventful year so far, one that\u2019s seen the Calgary Stampeders establish themselves as the favorite, the Saskatchewan Roughriders struggle badly, and the East Division look entirely up for grabs.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2016/aug/23/nfl-player-suspension-tom-brady-leveon-bell\">Player suspensions: the best punishment an NFL team could hope for</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The season has served up plenty of <a href=\"http://www.tsn.ca/the-rouge-a-season-of-compelling-storylines-1.555212\">compelling storylines</a> to chew on. All of which makes it a little odd that, for a few days this week, the biggest story in Canadian football was a failed American quarterback who isn\u2019t playing anywhere right now.</p> <p>That\u2019s the power of reputation and celebrity, both of which Johnny Manziel has more than his share of. What the former Browns starter doesn\u2019t have, at least right now, is much of a future in pro football. But that could change, and more and more fans are wondering if a stint in the CFL might serve as a starting point.</p> <p>It\u2019s an intriguing idea. But could it happen? Let\u2019s work through the key questions.</p> <h2>Could Manziel actually come to Canada?</h2> <p>Technically speaking, sure. Manziel\u2019s Canadian rights are owned by the Hamilton Tiger-Cats, and there\u2019s nothing in the rulebook that would prevent them from bringing him aboard if both sides could agree to a deal (or sending his rights to some other team that wanted him).</p> <p>Of course, Manziel has far bigger problems right now. The former Heisman Trophy winner washed out of his first crack at the NFL thanks to a combination of on-the-field struggles and off-the-field issues. That latter category includes rumors of out-of-control partying, a suspension for substance abuse, and an indictment for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/apr/26/johnny-manziel-indicted-assault-nfl\">assaulting his ex-girlfriend</a>. In recent public appearances, he reportedly hasn\u2019t looked like he was in any sort of playing shape.</p> <p>So clearly, Manziel has some significant questions to answer before he\u2019ll be playing anywhere, and it\u2019s quite possible that we\u2019ve seen the last of him on a football field. But speculation over his future flared up this week in part thanks to CFL commissioner Jeffrey Orridge, who appeared to leave the door open to Manziel playing in the league in <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/17387022/johnny-manziel-welcome-canadian-football-league-says-commissioner-jeffrey-orridge\">comments made to ESPN</a>. Orridge\u2019s words were framed as suggesting that Manziel would be welcome in Canada, a characterization he <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Commish13/status/768866525008637952\">later denied</a>. And the Tiger-Cats say that they\u2019ve had <a href=\"https://twitter.com/garylawless/status/768860897695698944\">no contact with Manziel of his camp</a>.</p> <p>So if all of this is largely speculation and what-if scenarios, why were <a href=\"http://nypost.com/2016/08/25/johnny-manziels-second-chance-could-begin-in-the-cfl/\">so many people talking about it</a>? A big part of that is no doubt based on Manziel\u2019s fame, even if it\u2019s largely been of the train wreck variety lately. But there\u2019s another piece here, and it has to do with some CFL history at the quarterback position.</p> <h2>Could Manziel succeed in the CFL?</h2> <p>While Manziel has recently spoken about his desire to <a href=\"http://nypost.com/2016/07/19/it-cant-end-like-this-has-johnny-manziel-finally-woken-up/\">return to pro football</a>, we\u2019re working with a question of \u201cif\u201d and not \u201cwhen\u201d, and the \u201cif\u201d is bolded and underlined. But if Manziel did manage to play again, could the CFL be a good fit? There\u2019s some reason to think that it could.</p> <p>Canadian football is similar to the American version is most respects, but with some key differences. It\u2019s a three-down game, which makes a traditional running game less attractive. The field is wider, and the end zones are larger. There\u2019s an extra player on both sides of the ball, and the offense can send all its backfield players in motion before the snap. And, of course, the players simply aren\u2019t as good as their NFL brethren \u2013 billion-dollar TV contracts tend to have that effect. </p> <p>Add it all up, and the CFL game is one that favors passing, especially from mobile quarterbacks. The league\u2019s history has been filled with athletic QBs who could use their legs to chew up all that real estate, buying enough time and space to find open receivers or just to find the first down market on their own.</p> <p>That list includes legendary CFL quarterbacks like Damon Allen, Tracy Ham and Matt Dunnigan. And perhaps more importantly from Manziel\u2019s perspective, it also includes some players who established themselves up north before going on to stardom in the NFL, such as Jeff Garcia and Warren Moon.</p> <p>And then there\u2019s the most obvious comparison of all: Doug Flutie. Like Manziel, he was a former Heisman winner. Like Manziel, he had limited success in his first crack at the NFL. Like Manziel, he was a mobile quarterback who some saw as too small to succeed in the American game.</p> <p>Flutie headed to the CFL in 1990, and proceeding to rewrite the league\u2019s record book. Over eight years with three teams, Flutie won three championships and was named the league\u2019s Most Outstanding Player \u2013 the CFL equivalent of MVP honors \u2013 six times. He\u2019s widely considered to be among the best players in league history, if not the very best, period.</p> <p>Flutie didn\u2019t enjoy the same level of dominance when he returned to the NFL in 1998, but he made a Pro Bowl and played for eight seasons, four as a starter. When you talk about using the CFL as a stepping stone back to an NFL job, Flutie is the archetype.</p> <p>So could Manziel someday do the same? It\u2019s tempting to think that he could, given the similarities he shares with Flutie. But as <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/cfl/story/_/id/17384984/how-cfl-claim-johnny-manziel-former-nfl-cleveland-browns-quarterback\">this ESPN article explains</a>, CFL offenses have evolved over the years, and would appear less welcoming to a player like Manziel. Quarterbacks don\u2019t run as much as they once did, with game plans now favoring efficiency and accuracy. </p> <p>Manziel\u2019s scrambling style produced <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CS9HvIlIi_I\">highlights in college</a>, but rarely translated to success in the NFL. He wouldn\u2019t be facing the same caliber of defenders in Canada, but he also wouldn\u2019t have the same line protection of offensive weapons. You can carve the CFL up if you\u2019re Doug Flutie, but at this point, there\u2019s little indication that Manziel could do the same.</p> <p>And again, that assumes that he\u2019s even able to sort out his long list of off-the-field problems. Which brings us to our last question.</p> <h2>Would Canadians even want him?</h2> <p>Canadians are different from Americans, as you\u2019ve no doubt already been told if you\u2019ve ever spent more than three minutes talking to a Canadian. And those differences extend to the sports stars we cheer for. Americans love controversy, attitude and over-the-top antics. Canadians appreciate dull and dreary.</p> <p>America is LeBron James throwing chalk, Floyd Mayweather talking trash and Bryce Harper flipping bats. Canada is Sidney Crosby talking about getting pucks in deep. America is about destroying your opponent and then standing over him. Canada is about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2016/aug/22/canada-olympics-rio-2016-penny-oleksiak-andre-degrasse\">becoming his new best friend</a>.</p> <p>That\u2019s the way we Canadians like to think of it, at least. So it\u2019s tempting to say that no, Manziel wouldn\u2019t be wanted up here. The kid is a bad apple, and he wouldn\u2019t be a good fit in a country where you\u2019re expected to apologize to people who bump into you.</p> <p>But strip away the pretentious back-patting, and Canadians turn out to be a lot like everyone else: we\u2019ll put up with a lot from our athletes as long as you can win games. If Manziel could really be the next Flutie, or even anything close, lots of Canadian fans would forget all about his other issues. It\u2019s just the nature of being a sports fan, wherever you are.</p> <p>After all, Manziel would hardly be the first troubled ex-NFLer to be welcomed to the CFL with open arms. Dexter Manley\u2019s history of failed drug tests didn\u2019t stop him getting a shot in Ottawa. Same with Ricky Williams in Toronto. And more recently, controversial receiver Chad \u201cOchocinco\u201d Johnson was signed by Montreal.</p> <p>None of those players had much success in the CFL, and there\u2019s a good chance that Manziel would meet the same fate. But if he found his game, and stayed out of any off-the-field headlines, plenty of Canadian fans would welcome him.</p> <p>For now, based on denials from Orridge and the Tiger-Cats, it doesn\u2019t seem like those fans will get the chance any time soon. There\u2019s a long way to go before Manziel plays football anywhere; it may never happen. But from time to time, Canadian football fans will at least mull over the possibility, debating it from barstools and tailgates. Manziel wouldn\u2019t be the first speedy quarterback to try his hand up north and turn heads, just like he wouldn\u2019t be the first American washout to arrive and then quickly vanish.</p>",
  "<p>During my <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/davehillblog/2016/aug/19/how-ada-aims-to-fill-britains-digital-skills-gap-from-tottenham-hale\">recent visit to Tottenham</a> I heard a story about some local school children who didn\u2019t know the Thames when they saw it. A teacher had taken them to the <a href=\"http://www.shakespearesglobe.com/theatre/whats-on/globe-theatre\">Globe theatre</a>. On arrival a member of her party pointed at the wide ribbon of water flowing by and asked: \u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d</p> <p>Such stories are not unusual. Many disadvantaged London children, taking after their parents, rarely travel beyond their own corner of the capital. The wider London of dazzling variety and rich possibility can remain foreign and even threatening to them. </p> <p>One of the reasons housing benefit reform seems <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/davehillblog/2016/may/23/forget-social-cleansing-the-problem-in-london-is-poverty\">not to have resulted</a> in London households moving homes in as large numbers or over as large distances as some had feared is that many low income families appear willing to make <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/davehillblog/2013/may/31/london-housing-benefit-government-impacts-report\">considerable sacrifices</a> in other areas of their lives in order to bridge their rent gaps and stay put, rather than break important local family and friendship ties.</p> <p>Might there also be a related attainment gap between the excellent exam results so many London school children obtain and the uses to which they put them once they\u2019ve left school? Might attainment levels among London\u2019s less affluent children - of whom there are <a href=\"http://www.cpag.org.uk/campaigns/child-poverty-london/keyfacts\">far too many</a> - themselves be depressed by a limited sense of the opportunities London offers them, arising from a limited sense of belonging to London as a whole?</p> <p>Such questions have certainly been raised before and perhaps are in the mind of <a href=\"https://www.london.gov.uk/people/assembly/Joanne-MCCARTNEY\">Joanne McCartney</a>, the experienced Labour London Assembly member and recently-appointed statutory deputy mayor to whom Sadiq Khan has now also handed <a href=\"https://joannemccartney.co.uk/2016/08/25/joanne-mccartney-am-assumes-responsibility-for-education-and-childcare/\">responsibility for education and childcare</a>. Mayors currently have no formal, direct powers over London schooling, but the profile of City Hall means that they and their lieutenants can highlight issues, mobilise opinion and bring people together to launch and support new initiatives. </p> <p>Boris Johnson <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/davehillblog/2009/sep/09/boris-johnson-mayors-academies-london-development-agency\">sponsored academy schools</a>, encouraged the <a href=\"http://slippedisc.com/2014/09/boris-dishes-out-cash-to-young-musicians/\">learning of musical instruments</a>, formed a <a href=\"https://www.london.gov.uk/what-we-do/education-and-youth/improving-standards-schools-and-teaching/london-schools-gold-club-0-0\">gold club</a> to recognise schools that had done well in adverse circumstances and commissioned a <a href=\"https://www.london.gov.uk/sites/default/files/gla_migrate_files_destination/The%20Mayor's%20Education%20Inquiry%20Final%20Report%20-%20Executive%20Summary.pdf\">report</a> which called for <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-19980071\">a pan-London education authority to be set up</a>, taking control over admissions, building connections between schools - more and more of which are outside local authority control - and raising standards. Last November, he advocated the creation of a <a href=\"https://www.london.gov.uk/press-releases/mayoral/london-schools-commissioner\">London schools commissioner</a> to address the capital\u2019s need for more school places and to recruit and retain teachers.</p> <p>Johnson has strong views on education, not all of them daft. Though a fan of the absurd Tory movement to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2014/nov/11/boris-johnson-backing-grammar-schools\">bring back grammar schools</a> and predictably enthused by the idea of free schools being <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/davehillblog/2014/may/18/sulivan-school-hammersmith-and-fulham-council\">mini-Etons on the state</a>, he\u2019s also a champion of the arts and foreign languages - not only <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/comment/columnists/borisjohnson/7445850/This-lunacy-about-Latin-makes-me-want-to-weep-with-rage.html\">Latin</a> - and a believer that education is about something more than being good at doing tests. </p> <p>Just before leaving City Hall he announced a scheme called <a href=\"https://www.london.gov.uk/press-releases/mayoral/new-scheme-to-help-vulnerable-schoolchildren\">Stepping Stones</a>, designed to help vulnerable children make the transition from primary to secondary school. It is based at a Tottenham primary. Joanne McCartney\u2019s <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enfield_and_Haringey_(London_Assembly_constituency)\">constituency</a>, which she has represented since 2004, contains Tottenham, so she\u2019ll be well aware of the situation there. But, of course, her new remit takes in the whole of the capital and also includes pre-school care. Her priorities are listed as improving pre-school childcare provision, helping boroughs to provide school places and bolstering a city-wide effort to recruit a new generation of headteachers.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re lucky that our schools are amongst the best in the country and young Londoners are full of bright talent,\u201d she says. \u201cBut we still have a job to do to make sure all London\u2019s young people receive the schooling they deserve. I\u2019m looking forward to working with London boroughs, teachers and most importantly, schoolchildren to ensure that together we can ensure that all children, regardless of their background, are able to flourish and excel from early-years through to their chosen career path.\u201d</p> <p>Wish her luck in her new role. Perhaps she could begin by organising a mass visit to the Thames.</p>",

  "<p>Halfway through this cathartic show, Eagles of Death Metal frontman Jesse Hughes shouts: \u201cRock and roll will never die!\u201d It\u2019s the sort of off-the-peg, in-the-moment war cry you might hear at many gigs.

His claim in May that he had seen Muslims celebrating in the streets after the Paris attacks were provocative enough that his band were removed from the bill of two French music festivals <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/20/french-festivals-ditch-eagles-of-death-metal-over-singers-comments-jesse-hughes\">taking place this weekend</a>. (Instead, Eagles of Death Metal will play Reading and Leeds.)</p> <p>At their first UK show since the attack, the band take the stage to the unlikely stomp of Shang-a-Lang by the Bay City Rollers. They\u2019re cheered loudly and at length, the sort of reaction usually heard at the end of a triumphant gig rather than before the band have played a single note. It allows Hughes to ritually undo perhaps one too many buttons on his shirt and carefully primp his bushy Doc Holliday moustache.</p> <p>In a scuzzy 90-minute set of raucous, ratbag rock, the Bataclan experience is referenced only obliquely. It remains unclear whether the Eagles of Death Metal gig was targeted because the band were from the US; for his part, Hughes seems happy to symbolise his country. During the rattling two-chord boogie of I Only Want You, large banners unfurl to reveal Uncle Sam\u2019s iconic recruiting posters recreated with Hughes\u2019s likeness.</p> <p>You could arguably read something into their plangent reading of Save a Prayer, but the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Uxc9eFcZyM\">Duran Duran cover</a> was a mainstay of their set before last November. There are no lengthy sermons, despite Hughes\u2019s habit of hollering like an impassioned tent preacher. Instead, there is exhilarating rock burlesque. Hughes vamps. He struts. He repurposes jokes from Airplane. He pulls on a bright red jacket with \u201cBowie\u201d embroidered on the back before the band play a roughed-up but rather beautiful version of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFDj3shXvco\">Moonage Daydream</a>.</p> <p>The closest acknowledgement of their horrific experience comes near the end. \u201cIt\u2019s been a strange fucking year and I am so grateful,\u201d says Hughes. His ramshackle band represent the right to make preening, priapic, occasionally obnoxious rock\u2019n\u2019roll, a sentiment that goes over well with the exultant crowd, who radiate a protective positivity. Before a last splurge of excessive guitar solos, Hughes offers one final piece of advice: \u201cStay horny!\u201d</p>",
  "<p>How do you describe the taste and texture of a prawn? Sort of rubbery; elastic, even. Like chicken, only better. These unappetising phrases hardly capture what makes it so good\u2014the precise reason why prawns (called shrimp in the United States) are one of the most consumed seafoods globally. But now biotech startup <a href=\"http://www.newwavefoods.com/#start\">New Wave Foods</a> is on a mission to mimic the exact texture and taste of a prawn, in a product made entirely out of algae and plant ingredients.</p> <p>The small, orangey-pink whorls they\u2019ve created look uncannily like the real thing. But what do they taste like? That\u2019s a question for Dominique Barnes, CEO of California-based New Wave Foods. \u201cWe\u2019ve done a few blind taste tests\u2014unofficially, you know\u2014and until we tell people it\u2019s made of plants and algae they can\u2019t tell,\u201d says Barnes, who comes from a background in marine conservation. </p> <p>The company claims to have fully recreated the bouncy texture and fishy undertones of a real prawn: on the back of this success they recently secured seed funding from investors Efficient Capacity and New Crop Capital, which will help get the product off the ground. By next year, they aim to have it commercialised in the U.S.\u2014and already, their imitation prawns have passed the culinary test. When the company presented their product in March at Google\u2019s San Francisco caf\u00e9, the executive chef \u201cwas so impressed that he ordered 200 pounds on the spot,\u201d Barnes recalls.</p> <p>New Wave Foods sprang onto the scene in 2015 with a project aiming to produce artificial shark fin out of genetically modified yeast, in an attempt to make the controversial delicacy more sustainable. Now, the focus has shifted to replicating shellfish. \u201cI grew up in Las Vegas and I had a very bleak perspective on seafood,\u201d says Barnes, describing a place where 99c shrimp cocktails were abundant, despite the city\u2019s location mid-desert, hours from the sea. That\u2019s indicative of America generally, where shrimp can be absurdly attainable, steeped as it is in the country\u2019s culinary culture: it remains the most popular seafood in the United States, with an average <a href=\"http://www.worldwildlife.org/industries/farmed-shrimp\">four pounds</a> consumed per capita each year. \u201cShrimp really stood out as this well-loved product, but also one with lots of problems,\u201d says Barnes.</p> <p>The prawn fishing industry has been at the heart of an environmental controversy for years. Ocean-going vessels are linked with multiple <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/world-on-a-plate/2013/jun/10/fish-fishing\">ecological ills</a>, including bycatch, thanks to the unforgiving fine mesh nets used to scoop up prawns from the sea. Prawn aquaculture, carried out at industrial scales in countries like India, Vietnam, and Brazil, also results in widespread mangrove destruction and deforestation. Then there\u2019s the industry\u2019s shocking <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2014/jun/10/supermarket-prawns-thailand-produced-slave-labour\">link to slavery</a>: migrants unwittingly trafficked into the industry, typically in Asia, are forced to work on fishing boats and farms, enduring brutal conditions with little hope of escape. It\u2019s this backlog of human rights abuses that make prawns so abundant and affordable in many parts of the world. </p> <p>\u201cThere are many growing concerns associated with imported, farm-raised shrimp, as well as the devastating human trafficking on certain foreign shrimp vessels and farms around the world,\u201d says Kimberly Warner, senior scientist at ocean advocacy non-profit Oceana, who also <a href=\"http://oceana.org/sites/default/files/shrimp_fraud_brochure_final_lores.pdf\">produced a report</a> in 2014 on the widespread mislabelling of shrimp in the U.S. Barnes, who felt the solutions to these problems \u201cwere moving slower than we needed them to,\u201d sees synthetic prawns as a way to take some pressure off the oceans.</p> <p>The prawns are made completely without animal cells: the recipe blends plant ingredients with red algae, which gives the product its realistic coral hue. While the company can\u2019t share the finer details of their technique\u2014pioneered by the company\u2019s materials scientist and co-founder Michelle Wolf\u2014Barnes says it involves pinpointing the building blocks of the food they\u2019re trying to replicate, and searching for replacements in a wide range of algae and plants. \u201cIt\u2019s really about understanding what creates the texture properties of shrimp, and then looking for molecules that mimic that,\u201d she says.</p> <p>In the lab, they use machines to rigorously test the tensile strength, elasticity, and texture of the synthetic prawn to make sure it comes as close as possible to the real thing. \u201cBut really there\u2019s no better tool to measure texture than a mouth,\u201d says Barnes. \u201cSo there\u2019s a lot of taste testing!\u201d </p> <p>Producing over <a href=\"file://localhost/docrep/fao/011/i0300e/i0300e.pdf\">6 million tonnes</a> annually, the global prawn industry is massive; of course, replacing the real thing with artificial prawns isn\u2019t going to solve the industry\u2019s myriad problems. It\u2019s also important that resources continue to be channelled into improving prawn fisheries and farming in the U.S. and elsewhere, Warner says. \u201cWild-caught, domestic shrimp has the potential to be a safe and sustainable choice if the U.S. seafood and fishing industries just make a few simple changes,\u201d she says\u2014like improving seafood traceability, and upgrading trawl nets so they snare less bycatch.</p> <p>Food forecasts indicate in any case that the future is ripe for animal protein analogues, whether as a replacement, or an addition to the real thing. But will a shrimp-obsessed nation be likely to welcome imitation shellfish into their homes? </p> <p>Barnes thinks so, though not necessarily due to shattering revelations of slavery and the industry\u2019s environmental impact, so much as the product\u2019s health benefits. \u201cGlobally, one of the top trends overall is people moving towards plant-based diets,\u201d she says. \u201cWhat\u2019s more personal than your health, right? I think that benefit of the product will resonate with the most people.\u201d </p> <p>Next year, the company plans to debut commercially with small breaded prawns, known as the wildly popular \u2018popcorn shrimp\u2019 in the U.S. In the future, they hope to bring the product to other parts of the world, too. \u201cJust give people an easy way to make a change, and they\u2019re doing this for themselves and the environment,\u201d says Barnes.</p>",
  "<p>Walking beside me through a market town centre is a lean, healthy, 46-year-old man. \u201cSo, you wanted me to show you how I used to look?\u201d He draws in his stomach, rounds his shoulders, paws imaginary sweat from his cheeks, and suddenly I\u2019m looking at a junkie \u2013 jumpy, wheedling, begging for a fix. \u201cAnd this is how you walk when you\u2019re going to score heroin.\u201d Subtly hunched over a sunken midriff, he strides ahead, as fast as he can without breaking into a run. \u201cIt\u2019s all in the stomach,\u201d he grins when I\u2019ve caught up. \u201cIt\u2019s all about stomach cramps.\u201d</p> <p>For 14 years, Neil Woods would leave behind his wife and two young children, put on stained \u201ccharity-shop scally tracksuit bottoms\u201d, and turn up in a town somewhere in England as a drug addict. \u201cI was a sponge for colloquialisms and mannerisms. Street slang is very regionalised, even just specific to a town, so you have to adapt quite quickly. The biggest danger at the start of any job is that you\u2019ve landed from Mars \u2013 and who are you?\u201d Using a new cover story each time, the undercover drugs squad officer would gradually befriend destitute addicts, ingratiate himself with their dealers, buy drugs from them \u2013 and then have the whole lot sent to jail.</p> <p>It\u2019s a struggle to reconcile the faux junkie Woods used to be with the articulate ex-policeman taking me for tea and cakes. \u201cOh, but I loved the art of deception,\u201d he offers. \u201cAnd I loved the development of the skill. It\u2019s a great thrill to be able to successfully deceive people. Particularly when it\u2019s dangerous.\u201d The dangers grew every year, as dealers cottoned on to undercover police tactics, and grew increasingly suspicious of a new face asking for drugs. One dealer tried to run Woods over, another held a knife to his groin, another pulled a 9mm Glock handgun on him. But the commendation awards kept piling up. Woods even helped formulate national guidelines for undercover operations, and trained officers all over the country in his skills. By his calculation, he consigned drug offenders to more than 1,000 years behind bars.</p> <p>He did feel guilty about jailing the hapless addicts who led him to the dealers. \u201cBut I told myself I was fighting the good fight, and that the ends justified the means.\u201d This moral justification seemed more compelling with each new assignment, due to the ever-escalating violence deployed by dealers to deter communities from talking to the police. In Northampton, Woods discovered a chilling new punishment for informants \u2013 gang rape of a girlfriend or sister \u2013 and every heroin addict in Brighton warned him that if the local dealers thought he had talked, the next hit of heroin he bought would kill him. Woods had wondered why heroin fatalities in Brighton were five times the national average. This wasn\u2019t an overdose epidemic, he realised, but dealers literally getting away with murder, making their victims\u2019 deaths look like just another accidental overdose.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/apr/02/un-war-on-drugs-failure-prohibition-united-nations\">The UN\u2019s war on drugs is a failure.

When Woods came across corrupt colleagues in the drug squad, the senior ranks would shrug that this was inevitable, given the money involved. A criminal trade that is worth \u00a37bn could buy as many police as it liked.</p> <p>\u201cBut the public don\u2019t tend to see this, and it\u2019s not really very much talked about, is it? One of the big problems is the duty of chief constables to maintain public confidence \u2013 which is understandable, because if the public lose confidence in the police, anarchy can follow. But it means there is no openness about the extent of corruption from the drug supply. So the public don\u2019t know. Compare that with prohibition in America up until 1933. The headlines in the press were constantly about the corruption that was being caused by prohibition.\u201d</p> <p>The realisation that the career he had risked his life for was not merely futile, but <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/may/08/spice-synthetic-marijuana-drug-screenings-tests\">the chief cause of the misery he had witnessed</a>, plunged Woods into a psychological crisis. He felt as if he was losing his mind until doctors diagnosed PTSD; it was so severe that even today Woods is twitchy and restless. A tic jerks his neck into spasms when he explains that the memories tormenting him were of the harm he had done to vulnerable addicts. This form of PTSD, he learned, is called Moral Damage. \u201cIt\u2019s about having done bad things. And I have done really bad things.\u201d</p> <p>He tried to talking to colleagues, but they were having none of it. If drugs were legalised, they assured him, the dealers and gangsters wouldn\u2019t disappear, but simply diversify into other crimes.</p> <p>\u201cThis is the greatest misunderstanding about crime. It\u2019s not criminals that cause crime, it\u2019s opportunity.\u201d No other crime presents the same opportunity for \u201cany 15-year-old\u201d to make anything like as much money as easily and with so little risk of being caught. \u201cAnd it\u2019s all about the demand as well. The government\u2019s own statistics say three million people in this country use cannabis.

Alongside that, 50% of acquisitive crime is committed by less than 0.2% of the population. And that\u2019s problematic heroin users.

By now it\u2019s hard to remember that Woods was ever a policeman. He tucks into \u201cthis bog-standard reply\u201d as if it were a banquet. \u201cThere\u2019s two answers to counter that view. For one, burglars are a tiny number of people. As any police inspector or sergeant will tell you, you can decrease the amount of burglaries in a town of 25,000 people by half by catching two burglars. And by catching burglars, you reduce the demand for that crime, so to speak. But by policing drugs, you don\u2019t reduce the demand. You have no impact on the demand whatsoever.\u201d</p> <p>He cites a global study, conducted by the coalition government, of the impact that punitive drug policies have had on drug use. Its unambiguous conclusion, he says, was that \u201chowever harsh your measures \u2013 the death penalty, 20 years in prison \u2013 they have no impact on drug use\u201d. Instead of wasting our time trying to reduce drug use, argues Woods, \u201cdrug policy should be about reducing not drug use, but drug harm\u201d.</p> <p>The second point, he continues, \u201cis that a burglary causes all sorts of devastation, so is wrong in itself. But the only reason why drugs are prohibited is because we made a decision.\u201d The impulse to temporarily alter one\u2019s mind is both natural and universal, and unless we think inebriation intrinsically immoral \u2013 in which case alcohol has to go, and probably coffee, too \u2013 to allow one method while banning another \u201cmakes no sense at all\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2011/jul/24/war-on-drugs-40-years\">Nixon's 'war on drugs' began 40 years ago, and the battle is still raging</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Following residential treatment for PTSD, Woods never returned to work.

We have all this richness in our culture and yet you look around publishing and there are so many rural historical experiences, and everyone\u2019s Anglo Saxon.\u201d</p> <p>The win, he said, was \u201cthe most momentous news of my life\u201d, like being awake in a dream. \u201cI had to say to myself, it\u2019s really true.

  "<p>Why is taking care of children worthwhile? It\u2019s hard work, badly paid if paid at all, and full of uncertainty, guilt and heavy lifting. And yet, at least to most of us, it seems like an absolutely fundamental, profoundly valuable project. If you asked most parents about their deepest moral commitments, and most agonising moral dilemmas, about what gives their lives meaning, they would talk about their children. But caring for a child is very different from any other human relationship, and the standard ways of thinking about morality and meaning don\u2019t apply very well to being&#xa0;a parent.</p> <p>Caring for children is deeply paradoxical. There\u2019s a profound tension between dependence and independence. Parents and other caregivers must take complete responsibility for&#xa0;that most utterly dependent of creatures, the human baby. But they must also transform that utterly dependent creature into a completely independent and autonomous adult. We start out feeding and changing and physically holding our children most of the day, and doing all this with surprising satisfaction and even happiness. We end up, if we\u2019re lucky, with the occasional affectionate text message from a distant city. A marriage or friendship that was like that would be peculiar, if not downright pathological.</p> <p>Our children not only are autonomous and independent from us, they are also part of a new generation that is&#xa0;autonomous and independent from the previous one. Infancy and intimacy go together \u2013 we hold our babies close, literally and metaphorically. Our adult children are and should be foreigners: inhabitants of the future.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We feel the welfare of our children is more important than any\u00adthing else, even that of other children or our happiness</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>A second tension comes from the specificity of our love for children. I care about my children in a special way. And this specific commitment isn\u2019t just a matter of genetic affinity. Almost anyone who cares for a child will come to love just that specific, special miracle. We feel that the welfare of the children we care for is more important than just about anything else, even the welfare of other children or our own happiness. We can be \u2013 we even should be \u2013 ruthless about advancing it.</p> <p>These characteristics of being a parent don\u2019t fit well into traditional philosophical discussions of morality. Utilitarians, for example, think we should make moral decisions by calculating what will lead to \u201cthe greatest good for the greatest number\u201d. A philosophical theory associated with Kant, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deontological_ethics\" title=\"\">deontology</a>, claims that there are absolute and universal moral principles we should all follow.</p> <p>But neither of these approaches captures the particular morality of caring for children. The traditional accounts assume that moral agents are independent and autonomous decision-making creatures trying to find a way to live with each other. But the morality of being a parent is about taking a creature who isn\u2019t autonomous and can\u2019t make his own decisions, and turning him or her into one who can.</p> <p>They also don\u2019t capture the specificity of our feelings about children. The classical theories turn on the idea that moral and political principles should be universal. Fairness, equality, justice \u2013 these ideas are supposed to apply to everybody. The very idea of a law, for example, is that some principle applies equally to all. But I care about and am responsible for my own specific children, far more than children in general. And so I should be.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>People can care deeply for their own children, but be relatively indifferent to children in general</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Think only of the difficult decision many of us make about whether to send our children to state schools or private ones. The utilitarian principle of the greatest good for the greatest number should make you choose state schools. But a genuinely moral impulse to do the best for your particular children might lead you to private ones instead.</p> <p>The Kantian picture doesn\u2019t really apply either. Caring for children is a profound good, but it isn\u2019t and shouldn\u2019t be a universal imperative. People can care deeply for their own children, but be relatively indifferent to&#xa0;children in general. And, of course, many people, by choice or circumstance, don\u2019t take care of children at all.</p> <p>Perhaps the most prevalent, if often implicit, contemporary picture of the value of children is a variant of utilitarianism. The view is that caring for children is valuable because it allows you to do something called \u201cparenting\u201d. \u201cParenting\u201d involves acquiring a particular kind of expertise that will let you shape children into adults with particular features \u2013 smart or successful or happy. You can measure the value of the care you provide by the quality of the adults you create.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/aug/17/gardener-and-the-carpenter-by-alison-gopnik-review\">The Gardener and the Carpenter by Alison Gopnik review \u2013 modern parenting is all wrong</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But that picture is also deeply at odds with the nature of caring for children. Your goal as a parent is not to determine how that helpless baby will turn out. It\u2019s to turn him or her into an autonomous being who, for good or ill, will be able to shape his or her own life, take his or her own risks, become a unique new person constructing a unique new life.</p> <p>The \u201cparenting\u201d picture also doesn\u2019t fit with the specificity of our feeling for children. If the aim were to create the best adults, you\u2019d think that you would seek out the children who were most likely to succeed and put all your energy into shaping them. But, of course, we feel an unconditional commitment to&#xa0;just this one particular child, who happens to be ours, almost no matter what the child is like.</p> <p>Another, less dominant philosophical tradition \u2013 a version of what <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/jun/16/isaiah-berlin-letters-modern-youth\" title=\"\">Isaiah Berlin</a> called \u201cvalue pluralism\u201d \u2013 may be the best way to think about caring for children. We have a multiplicity of diverse ethical values and those values are often simply incompatible. There is&#xa0;no way to measure or weigh them against each other, no single value that&#xa0;trumps the others. They can\u2019t be measured against each other in a way that reveals the single best thing to do. And yet often, in real life, we have to choose between them.</p> <p>Berlin thought this made human life inescapably tragic, and he was right. But it is also what makes it rich and deep. Caring for children fits Berlin\u2019s picture better than utilitarianism or deontology, and the choices we all have to make don\u2019t have any simple resolution.</p> <p>In fact, being a parent is valuable precisely because it is so unlike goal-directed productive work. Caring for a child involves a deep recognition of the individuality and autonomy, the irreducible complexity and value of another unique, irreplaceable human being.

Just days before Wednesday\u2019s launch of Our Revolution, an organisation which aims to build on the momentum of the senator\u2019s Democratic primary campaign, more than half of its staff resigned.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/25/fleeing-the-bern-half-of-staff-quit-sanders-legacy-project-before-it-begins\">Fleeing the Bern: half of staff quit Sanders legacy project before it begins</a> </p> </aside>  <p>This was not a case of a few volunteers deciding they didn\u2019t have the time to work towards a revolution. This was core staff members in key positions deciding Our Revolution was doomed to failure. Eight people quit \u2013 from a staff of 15. The entire organising department went. The digital director, Kenneth Pennington, went too.</p> <p>For an organisation aiming to organise grassroots volunteers through digital media, this was quite a blow. It landed after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/25/fleeing-the-bern-half-of-staff-quit-sanders-legacy-project-before-it-begins\">Jeff Weaver</a>, who managed Sanders\u2019 primary campaign, was appointed president of the group.</p> <p>Under the stewardship of Weaver \u2013 who has worked on Sanders campaigns for three decades \u2013 the Vermont senator won <a href=\"http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/was-the-democratic-primary-a-close-call-or-a-landslide/\">more than 13 million votes</a>, proving an unlikely challenger to the eventual nominee, Hillary Clinton. But even as Sanders was riding a wave of activism and involvement not seen for decades, dissatisfaction with Weaver was spreading.</p> <p> Younger Sanders staff members were critical of money spent on television ads, funds they felt would be better spent on outreach. Grassroots activists spoke of a lack of coordination between the campaign and volunteers on the ground. </p> <p>Claire Sandberg, until this week organising director at Our Revolution, was among the most vocal critics. \u201cI left and others left because we were alarmed that Jeff would mismanage this organization as he mismanaged the campaign,\u201d she <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/25/us/politics/bernie-sanders-our-revolution-group.html?smprod=nytcore-iphone&amp;smid=nytcore-iphone-share\">told the New York Times</a>.</p> <p>Sandberg said she was concerned about how Our Revolution would raise and spend money, fearing the group would \u201cbetray its core purpose by accepting money from billionaires and not remaining grassroots funded and ploughing that billionaire cash into TV instead of investing it in building a genuine movement\u201d.</p> <p>An anonymous staff member <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2016/08/bernie-sanders-group-turmoil-227297\">told Politico</a> they joined Our Revolution after promises from Sanders and his wife Jane Sanders \u2013 chair of Our Revolution\u2019s board \u2013 that Weaver would not be involved.</p> <p>Weaver\u2019s appointment was not the only thing to turn activists away. Our Revolution has been registered as a 501(c)4 organisation, which means it is able to accept large donations from anonymous donors. Given that a large part of the senator\u2019s appeal in the primary lay in his criticism of the acceptance of anonymous money in politics, this is anathema to many Sanders supporters.</p> <p>Furthermore, the group is being run by two white men: Weaver and executive director Shannon Jackson. This is worrying to some supporters, given <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/may/03/bernie-sanders-failure-diversity-hispanic-black-voters\">Sanders\u2019 struggle to appeal to minorities</a>. One source close to the project, from a minority background, said they had \u201cconcerns about how are these two people qualified to do the kind of work that needs to be done to organise people of color\u201d.</p> <p>There are also questions over what Our Revolution will actually do. On Wednesday Sanders spoke for 40 minutes. He spent 30 minutes heralding the success of his presidential campaign. Beyond listing the candidates and issues on which he said Our Revolution would focus, operational details were scarce.</p> <p>There was talk of organising people to campaign for candidates and protest against issues such as Citizens United, the supreme court decision that unfettered political donations, and a single-payer healthcare system. </p> <p>Sanders also said: \u201cReal change never ever takes place from the top on down. It happens when people come together and demand fundamental change in this country.\u201d</p> <p>This did not quite chime with the idea of a nationwide organizing project that, it seems, will aim to issue top-down missives to activists.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/14/third-party-candidates-johnson-stein-mcmullin-debate-polling-percentage\">Third-party presidential candidates fight for 15% in polls \u2013 and a spot in debates</a> </p> </aside>  <p>One more thing could hamper Our Revolution: it seems Sanders isn\u2019t going to be a part of it. Listening to his speech on Wednesday, it seemed as if he planned a distinctly hands-off role. </p> <p>\u201cAs I understand it,\u201d he said, \u201cOur Revolution will endorse 100 candidates.\u201d</p> <p>Later he mentioned a ballot initiative in Colorado in support of single-payer healthcare. </p> <p>\u201cAs I understand it,\u201d he said, \u201cOur Revolution will be supporting that ballot item.\u201d</p> <p>The attention of some supporters has already started to drift.

The picture they paint is one of routine dysfunction and deliberate cruelty.</p> <p>\u201cThese detainees must be settled in the Australian community as is their right under international law,\u201d said Nadine El-Enany, another alliance organiser. \u201cWe have chosen to read the report out in front of Australia House because this narrative of abuse directly contradicts the image the Australian high commission seeks to convey of Australia as a progressive nation and a desirable destination for tourists, students, highly skilled workers and international investors. </p> <p>\u201cNauru Files Reading embodies the ongoing racist violence that has defined the settler colony of Australia since its inception,\u201d she added.</p> <p>The protests are timed to coincide with a <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/events/768130646539128/\">national day of action in Australia</a>, with events planned across the country to demand that the government immediately close the camps on Nauru, Manus Island and Christmas Island. </p> <p>The Guardian\u2019s analysis of the files revealed that children were vastly over-represented in the reports. More than half of the 2,116 reports \u2013 1,086 incidents, or 51.3% of the total \u2013 involve children, although children made up only about 18% of those in detention on Nauru during the time covered by the reports, May 2013 to October 2015. The findings came just weeks after the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/jul/26/abu-ghraib-images-children-detention-australia-public-inquiry\">brutal treatment of young people in juvenile detention in the Northern Territory</a> was exposed, leading to the Australian prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/jul/26/malcolm-turnbull-announces-royal-commission-northern-territory-detention\">announcing a wide-ranging public inquiry.</a></p> <p>Some reports contain distressing examples of behaviour by traumatised children. According to a report from September 2014, a girl had sewn her lips together. A guard saw her and began laughing at her. In July that year, a child under the age of 10 undressed and invited a group of adults to insert their fingers into her vagina; in February 2015, a young girl gestured to her vagina and said a male asylum seeker \u201ccut her from under\u201d.</p> <p>In the files, there are seven reports of sexual assault of children, 59 reports of assault on children, 30 of self-harm involving children and 159 of threatened self-harm involving children.</p> <p>The files raise stark questions about how information is reported on Nauru, one of Australia\u2019s two offshore detention centres for asylum seekers who arrive by boat. They highlight serious concerns about the ongoing risks to children and adults held on the island. They show how the Australian government has failed to respond to warning signs and reveal sexual assault allegations \u2013 many involving children \u2013 that have never previously been disclosed.</p> <p>The most damning evidence emerges from the words of the staff working in the detention centre themselves \u2013 the people who compile the reports. These caseworkers, guards, teachers and medical officers have been charged with caring for hundreds of asylum seekers on the island.</p> <p> \u201cThe Australian government detains refugees indefinitely [on these islands] as part of its offshore detention policy designed to deter refugees from arriving in Australia by boat,\u201d said El-Enany. \u201cMore than 500 refugees are detained on Nauru, including many children.</p> <p>\u201cRefugees on Nauru are regularly subjected to abuse, violence, sexual assault and rape. Self-harm and suicide attempts are common,\u201d she said. </p>",

  "<p>Early in 1895, while facing charges of indecency and wondering if he should abscond to France, Oscar Wilde had no idea what a two-year prison sentence would mean for him. Wilde\u2019s misfortune was to serve his sentence just before prison conditions were officially changed by the 1898 Prison Act.</p> <p>In total isolation, first in Pentonville and Wandsworth, and then in Reading gaol, to which he was moved in November 1895, Wilde slept on a plank bed with no mattress. Allowed one hour\u2019s exercise a day, he walked in single file in the yard with other prisoners but he was not allowed to communicate with them. He could not sleep, he was permanently hungry and he suffered from dysentery. For the first month, Wilde was tied to a treadmill six hours a day, making an ascent, as it were, of 6,000 feet each day, with five minutes\u2019 rest after every 20 minutes. Towards the end of his sentence, the governor of the jail, Major Nelson, remarked to Wilde\u2019s friend Robert Ross: \u201cHe looks well. But like all men unused to manual labour who receive a sentence of this kind, he will be dead within two years.\u201d <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/may/13/oscar-wilde-gift-governor-reading-gaol-auction\">Wilde was later to praise Nelson</a>, who had arrived at Reading in July 1896, as \u201cthe most Christlike man I ever met\u201d. Nelson was more liberal than his predecessor and was ready to relax the rules.</p> <p>In January 1897, when Wilde still had more than four months still to serve, he and Nelson came up with an ingenious idea. While nothing in the prison regulations allowed prisoners to write plays or novels or essays, inmates had permission to write letters. Under the previous regime, Wilde had written to solicitors and the Home Office, or in limited quantities to friends, but his letters were inspected and the writing materials removed as he finished. But the regulations did not specify how long a letter should be. And if a letter were not finished, then the prisoner, it was supposed, could be allowed take it with him when he left the prison.</p> <p>Thus Wilde, alone in his cell, was given pen and ink every day. What he wrote was removed each evening and then, it seems, handed back to him in the morning, or parts were given back to him to revise. Since \u201cDe Profundis\u201d was in the form of a long letter, it would be his property when he was free. It took him three months, with much revision.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0fcdcbf05f6be5d2741766183a75afd516803449\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0fcdcbf05f6be5d2741766183a75afd516803449/0_0_2621_3997/656.jpg\" alt=\"Oscar Wilde 1890.\" width=\"656\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Oscar Wilde in around 1890.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Print Collector/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Wilde addressed his letter to Lord Alfred Douglas. On his release, he handed the manuscript to Ross, who had two typed copies made, one of which he sent to Douglas. In 1905 Ross published extracts from the text, and a fuller version in 1908. The complete version, however, was not published until 1949.</p> <p>By the time he wrote \u201cDe Profundis\u201d, Wilde\u2019s love for Douglas had turned into a sort of bitterness, and the tone of his long letter manages to capture that bitterness as well as the extraordinary attachment he felt for Douglas. \u201cDe Profundis\u201d, it should be said, is neither fair minded nor consistent; it is, at times, bloated in its comparisons and its rhetoric. (Wilde, for example, compares himself to Christ.) But there is also a beautiful, calm eloquence, and a sense of urgency, of things being said because there might not be time or opportunity to say them in the future.</p> <p>Wilde\u2019s old skill at paradox and phrase making was not there now merely to amuse his audience or mock his betters, but rather to kill his own pain and grief and attempt to communicate passionately and fiercely with his lover. He wrote not as art now, but as desperately serious matter.</p> <p>\u201cThe only beautiful things,\u201d his character Vivian had told us in \u201cThe Decay of Lying\u201d, which Wilde wrote in 1890, \u201care the things that do not concern us.\u201d Seven years later, in his cry from the depths, he wrote of what most deeply concerned him: \u201cIf there be one single passage that brings tears to the eyes, weep as we weep in prison when the day no less than the night is set apart for tears.\u201d And then, in what is perhaps the most shocking sentence in the whole letter, he wrote: \u201cThe supreme vice is shallowness.\u201d Once upon a time it would have been, for him, the supreme virtue.</p> <p>Wilde accused Douglas of distracting him from his art, of spending his money, of degrading him ethically, of constant scene-making, of deliberately and then thoughtlessly mistreating him. He went over Douglas\u2019s bad behaviour in matters large and petty, often citing dates and places and details. The tone was fluent and sweeping, full of carefully controlled cadence and measured elegance. But the difference between this tone and Wilde\u2019s carefully nurtured flippancy was astonishing. It was like a tenor becoming a baritone, with a new range and depth and a new attention to feeling, but the old skills and tricks with pitch and paradox still in place, despite his circumstances, or perhaps because of them.</p> <p>The letter cannot be read for its accurate account of their relationship, nor taken at its word. While some of the accusations are true, others are petty and foolish. But that is not the point. \u201cDe Profundis\u201d has neither the informality of a personal letter nor the distilled sound of a piece of imaginative writing. Its seductive, hurt and passionate tone places it in a category of its own. In all its urgency and ambiguous eloquence, it remains one of the greatest and most complex love letters ever written.</p> <p>It is fascinating to witness the change that came over Wilde\u2019s imaginative procedures as he wrote. In the dim light of the prison cell and with the memory of his suffering fresh, it was as though he sought a new sort of tension between breathlessness and breath-control. He wrote long and highly wrought sentences, loving lists of adjectives and clever, Latinate diction and elaborate punctuation. To be followed by a pure, plain statement, full of the clipped sharp tone of the Anglo-Saxon.</p> <p>\u201cOf course I should have got rid of you,\u201d he wrote. The reader will want to know why he did not, and part of the power of the text comes from our knowledge that, once Wilde was released, despite all his bitter feeling, he and Douglas attempted to live together again and resume their relationship, to the horror of both Douglas\u2019s family and Wilde\u2019s wife.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cc386679a34b9322687e9c181d0b2c22cc669a88\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cc386679a34b9322687e9c181d0b2c22cc669a88/0_9_3264_1958/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Colm T\u00f3ib\u00edn Reading prison\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Colm T\u00f3ib\u00edn in the cell of Reading prison where De Profundis was written.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR Image/PR IMage</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Until three years ago, Reading gaol, where Wilde served most of his sentence, was used as a place of incarceration for young offenders. The cells still have bunk beds, a small table and two seats riveted into the wall, and then, closer to the small window, a flush toilet hidden from view. The four corridors that make up each floor radiate from a central vantage point. Thus it is possible for one single member of staff to note any movement in the four corridors.</p> <p>While the creepy cell interiors bear all the hallmarks of recent use, the corridors and the general atmosphere in the prison, which was built in 1844, make it easy to imagine what it might have been like for Wilde in 1895.</p> <p>The place where floggings happened, for example, which Wilde evoked with such passionate shock in his letters to the Daily Chronicle on his release, is close to the yard where the prisoners could exercise, close enough for the victim\u2019s howls to be heard, as Wilde heard them in 1897. The cells that were used to house those condemned to death, evoked by Wilde in <em>The Ballad of Reading Gaol</em>, can still be visited. They are still part of the essential fabric of the place.</p> <p>Wilde was not prepared for prison, and did not, in his heyday, dream that he would spend two years in jail. In \u201cThe Decay of Lying\u201d, he had mocked the writer Charles Reade for \u201ca foolish attempt to be modern, to draw public opinion to the state of our convict prisons\u201d. In 1882, during a tour of America, when he visited a penitentiary in Nebraska, he wrote about the prisoners: \u201cThey were all mean looking, which consoled me, for I should hate to see a criminal with a noble face.\u201d</p> <p>When he found that a prisoner due to be hanged in Nebraska was reading a novel by Charlotte M Yonge called <em>The Heir of Redclyffe</em>, Wilde remarked: \u201cMy heart was turned by the eyes of the doomed man, but if he reads <em>The Heir of Redclyffe</em> it\u2019s perhaps as well to let the law take its course.\u201d But when he found a volume by Dante in another cell, he wrote: \u201cStrange and beautiful it seemed to me that the sorrow of a single Florentine in exile should, hundreds of years afterwards, lighten the sorrow of some common prisoner in a modern gaol.\u201d</p> <p>The cell where Wilde wrote \u201cDe Profundis\u201d is filled with a sense of those who recently suffered there, but the view of the sky from the small window and the heaviness of the door as it closes behind you bring back how one of the great spirits of his age was broken in body and soul in this space, and then restored to some dark approximation of life by being given pen and paper so that he too could lighten his sorrow, or make it matter more, by producing something as strange and beautiful as \u201cDe Profundis\u201d.</p> <p>\u2022 An exhibition, <em><a href=\"https://www.artangel.org.uk/project/inside/\">Inside \u2013 Artists and Writers in Reading Prison</a>, </em>is at the prison from 4 September to 30 October.

But it\u2019s not that surprising \u2013 most of us have some experience of the NHS as a true life-saver.

We\u2019re living longer. There are more of us. Demand has risen in hospitals and in health centres. But at the same time, government funding for the health service has been dangerously squeezed. Social care is continually neglected, putting even more pressure on hospitals. And successive ministers have refused to listen to doctors, nurses or patients when pushing through politically motivated NHS reorganisations.</p> <p>Conventional politics has failed us when it comes to the NHS. The voice of ordinary people \u2013 the likes of Jo, Elizabeth and Valerie \u2013 has never been more needed. And that\u2019s why they and hundreds of thousands of us are taking matters into our own hands. Think back to David Cameron\u2019s costly and damaging <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/feb/06/nhs-reforms-tories-damaging-thinktank-kings-fund\" title=\"\">NHS reorganisation</a>. Without a people-powered campaign to prevent the worst elements of Cameron\u2019s legislation, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/mar/30/health-act-means-death-of-nhs\" title=\"\">Health and Social Care Act</a> would have had far more harmful consequences.</p> <p>A new investigation commissioned by the campaign organisation 38 Degrees, where I work as executive director, is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/aug/26/nhs-plans-radical-cuts-to-fight-growing-deficit-in-health-budget\" title=\"\">published today</a>. Carried out by a team of health policy experts at <a href=\"http://www.incisivehealth.com/\" title=\"\">Incisive Health</a>, it exposes new plans being drawn up for the NHS across England, called \u201csustainability and transformation plans\u201d (STPs). The investigation has been funded by hundreds of thousands of people making individual donations via the <a href=\"https://home.38degrees.org.uk/\" title=\"\">38 Degrees website</a>. People like Jo, Elizabeth and Valerie have shared their personal stories, signed the campaign petition and donated to fund the research. Independent of party politics, we\u2019ve chipped in to protect the health service we value so much by putting these plans under the spotlight.</p> <p>The research finds huge funding gaps for local services, which, the experts say, could lead to A&amp;E closures, cuts to beds and mergers of hospitals. Put together, the projected funding shortfalls across England would see a \u00a323bn deficit in health and social care spending by 2021.</p> <p>Where Jo lives, in the Black Country, there are plans for major changes at Midland Metropolitan hospital, including the closure of A&amp;E. The plans also include the proposal to shut one of two district general hospitals. By 2021, the health and social care system in the Black Country is projected to be \u00a3476.6m short of the funds it needs to balance its books while maintaining the same level of care. Where Elizabeth lives, the draft plan indicates \u201creducing demand for acute services by approximately 500 beds\u201d. That\u2019s health manager-speak for cutting 500 hospital beds.</p> <p>Our crowdfunded investigation shows that this worrying plan for the Black Country is typical of many others across England.</p> <p>These kinds of cuts aren\u2019t the fault of local NHS leaders. They\u2019re being planned all across the country, the result of a growing black hole in the funding provided to the NHS by the government. Whether or not Theresa May allows these cuts to go ahead will be a key test of her commitment to protecting the NHS.</p> <p>The NHS belongs to all of us. So before these plans go any further, local people should have a say on any changes to their services. That\u2019s why almost 250,000 people have already signed the <a href=\"https://speakout.38degrees.org.uk/campaigns/nhs-stp-petition?utm_campaign=thankyou_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=member\" title=\"\">38 Degrees campaign petition</a> to the health secretary, Jeremy Hunt, calling for full public disclosure of the STPs for each and every one of the 44 areas across England.</p> <p>No one is suggesting that all changes to NHS services are bad. There may be a good case for some of the changes that are being proposed. But because the plans are not out in the open \u2013 we have had to hire specialist researchers to give us even a partial picture \u2013 there\u2019s every reason to fear that many of these will be about cost cutting at the expense of patient care and patient safety.</p> <p>One thing is certain: we know that when we leave the politics of the NHS to the politicians, it doesn\u2019t end well. Now, more than ever, people-powered campaigning is critical to the future of the NHS.</p>",

  "<p>Parliament is back on Tuesday after the longest winter. Since 2 July, Canberra time has stretched and slowed, a function of politics being pitched into an extended period of irresolution.<br></p> <p>Once the white cars pull up to the parliamentary forecourt again, time will accelerate as it does when politics is back in peak season. But it\u2019s not yet clear where the acceleration will lead, which makes this opening of federal parliament the most interesting since the minority parliament in 2010.</p> <p>We approach next week with a bunch of garden-variety unknowns.

Both of these issues are particularly important to Malcolm Turnbull\u2019s position as prime minister and Liberal party leader, and will shape his prospects over the short and medium term.</p> <p>The first is the marriage equality plebiscite, and the second is the continuing internal culture war going on inside the Coalition over section 18C of the Racial Discrimination Act.</p> <p>Let\u2019s recap the story of the plebiscite to date. Readers will recall it wasn\u2019t Malcolm Turnbull\u2019s idea. He started from the position of not supporting it. Now the prime minister has to support it, and, I suspect, now wants to support it, for two main reasons. The first is preserving the plebiscite was a condition of entry to the Liberal leadership. The plebiscite is not just an expensive opinion poll \u2013 it is a mechanism to hold the Liberal party together through the most dangerous internal issue since the civil war over Turnbull\u2019s support for Labor\u2019s proposed ETS in 2009.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/aug/24/bill-shorten-signals-labor-likely-to-block-marriage-equality-plebiscite\">Bill Shorten signals Labor likely to block marriage equality plebiscite</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It may not be obvious from a distance, but this group of Coalition MPs entering the 45<sup>th</sup> parliament are the most ideologically diverse group of liberal/conservatives seen at the federal level, possibly for decades. There is a huge spread, from moderate progressives through the centre to capital C conservatives, both the Abbott rump and the next generation. They are also the mouthiest bunch seen in Canberra in recent memory. Right now, everyone asserts their fundamental human right to stand on their digs. Earlier this week, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/aug/24/shorten-delivers-kidney-punches-with-a-smile-as-turnbull-braces-for-opening-rounds\">I described the Coalition as the party of war</a>, and I think there is plenty of evidence to back up that characterisation.</p> <p>So back to what the plebiscite does. It\u2019s a mechanism to allow capital C conservatives to campaign for discrimination against same-sex couples if they can\u2019t bear to do anything else. The process also allows small c conservatives to vote in favour of marriage equality in the parliament, if Australian voters do. This group can point to the will of the voters when the churches and the Australian Christian Lobby come knocking on their door demanding an explanation. And for liberal moderates, the plebiscite is a sanctioned mechanism for them to articulate their progressivism without being monstered by colleagues. Well, not too much, anyway.</p> <p>Think of the plebiscite as a flotation device for a prime minister who has emerged from an election contest with his authority diminished. So that\u2019s the practical reason to support the plebiscite if you are Malcolm Turnbull.</p> <p>There\u2019s also another reason. Some MPs who want marriage equality have also come round to the view that involving the public in the process is a positive for politics at a time when voters have had a gutful of the nonsense in Canberra. Some supporters of reform genuinely believe a public vote will give marriage equality legitimacy.</p> <p>I fully understand and respect why people in the LGBTI community think very differently and see only the downside risks associated with an outbreak of feelings on the marriage equality proposition, but of course politicians are hard wired to back themselves, to fancy themselves magnificent, catalytic, unifying figures. It\u2019s in their DNA.</p> <p>So, what\u2019s the status of the plebiscite at the opening of the new parliament? Right now, the plebiscite is in significant trouble. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/aug/26/greens-block-same-sex-marriage-plebiscite\">The Greens will oppose it</a>. A consequential clutch of crossbenchers say they will oppose it in the Senate.

I would be very surprised, as things currently stand, if Labor supported the plebiscite.</p> <p>Liberals, sensing the real danger that now exists on this issue, have rallied late in the week to try and make Shorten blink. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/aug/25/blocking-marriage-equality-plebiscite-could-delay-it-for-years-liberals-warn-labor\">People are warning Labor explicitly:</a> kill the plebiscite, and we will not help you bring same sex marriage back into the parliament.

When asked whether he intended to revisit this question he said no, then immediately qualified the no. \u201cNot at this stage.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNot at this stage\u201d doesn\u2019t mean no, it means not now. It\u2019s a curtsey to the base, and evidently an acknowledgement he feels he needs to make. Conservatives certainly noted it.</p> <p>Now why would Turnbull need to curtsey to the base on 18C?</p> <p>Perhaps it\u2019s just a coincidence of course, but who should bob up on Friday but the former prime minister Tony Abbott, having a chat to the sorts of folks who think 18C is a key performance indicator of Liberal leaders.

Saturday\u2019s trip to Tottenham Hotspur represents a far tougher test but J\u00fcrgen Klopp must be tempted to start Matip at White Hart Lane as he continues trying to repair a defence that remains alarmingly rickety. Matip\u2019s aerial prowess should help improve Liverpool\u2019s ability to defend set-pieces and he is a sound tackler and tidy builder from the back, but what his team need most in the absence of further defensive recruits is an organiser who can somehow instil concentration and calmness into chronically skittish team-mates. Of course Liverpool fans would welcome more brilliance from Sadio Man\u00e9, Philippe Coutinho and the rest of their attack-minded mischief-makers, but it will take solid defending at White Hart Lane to stoke belief that Liverpool can combine thrills with a successful title challenge this season. <strong>Paul Doyle</strong></p> <blockquote> <ul> <li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/aug/25/the-question-will-jurgen-klopp-be-given-time-liverpool\">The Question: How long will Liverpool keep faith with Klopp?</a></li> <li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/aug/25/mauricio-pochettino-unimpressed-by-erik-lamela-showboating-against-palace\">Pochettino takes dim view of Lamela\u2019s showboating</a></li> </ul> </blockquote>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/video/2016/aug/25/jurgen-klopp-dont-want-play-daniel-sturridge-wing-liverpool-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/5x96d\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2683624\"            data-video-name=\"J\u00fcrgen Klopp: I don't want to play Daniel Sturridge on the wing \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"SNTV\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-57bed9a6e4b0fe30498a4a31\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/08/25/160825liverpool_KP-29019384_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/08/25/160825liverpool_KP-29019384.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/08/25/160825liverpool_KP-29019384_WebM.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/video/2016/aug/25/jurgen-klopp-dont-want-play-daniel-sturridge-wing-liverpool-video\">J\u00fcrgen Klopp: I don\u2019t want to play Daniel Sturridge on the wing</a></figcaption> </figure>   <h2><strong>2) The Phelan reunion</strong></h2> <p>Are Hull City this season\u2019s Leicester?

Winning his first four matches is a good way for Guardiola to start, though it should be pointed out that City have been helped by some kind defending from Sunderland, Stoke City and Steaua Bucharest, meaning that it will be informative to see how they tackle the game against West Ham United, who <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/sep/19/manchester-city-west-ham-united-premier-league-match-report\">won 2-1</a> at the Etihad Stadium last year.

With Sergio Ag\u00fcero in hot goalscoring form, City should have enough to find a way through. Yet this could be a good test of their patience. <strong>JS</strong></p> <blockquote> <ul> <li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/aug/25/manchester-city-champions-league-draw-leicester-arsenal-tottenham\">City left to hanker for the beginners\u2019 luck of Leicester</a></li> <li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/aug/25/west-ham-juventus-simone-zaza-fee\">Zaza set for medical after West Ham agree \u00a324m fee with Juve</a></li> <li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/aug/25/west-ham-confirm-signing-of-edimilson-fernandes-from-fc-sion\">West Ham confirm signing of Fernandes from FC Sion</a></li> </ul> </blockquote>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/video/2016/aug/25/goalkeeper-claudio-bravo-completes-move-to-manchester-city-video-report\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/5x6gc\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2681706\"            data-video-name=\"Goalkeeper Claudio Bravo completes move to Manchester City \u2013 video report\"            data-video-provider=\"SNTV\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-57bdc7dee4b048662988fbda\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/08/25/160824bravfinal_KP-29022351_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/08/25/160824bravfinal_KP-29022351.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/08/25/160824bravfinal_KP-29022351_WebM.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/video/2016/aug/25/goalkeeper-claudio-bravo-completes-move-to-manchester-city-video-report\">Claudio Bravo completes move to Manchester City</a></figcaption> </figure>   <h2>4) Time for Cazorla to pull Arsenal\u2019s strings</h2> <p>Though Arsenal have not started the season well, it is also the case that their start has not been easy. A J\u00fcrgen Klopp side are not obliging opponents for a team allowing key players time off after a fraught summer and generally <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/aug/14/arsene-wenger-arsenal-injuries-liverpool\">seeking fitness and form</a>. Likewise a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/aug/20/leicester-city-arsenal-premier-league-match-report\">trip to Leicester</a>, last season\u2019s champions also desperate to avoid a repeat after a chastening defeat in their opening game. But they must not dwell on what has already happened, because the three most likely championship contenders \u2013 Chelsea, Manchester City and Manchester United \u2013 all have winnable fixtures. Arsenal cannot afford to find themselves six or seven points behind any of them, let alone all three.</p> <p>Last season, their annual collapse began with injury to Santi Cazorla, Ars\u00e8ne Wenger struggling to balance his midfield thereafter; yet in neither of Arsenal\u2019s two games this season has he been deployed in the deeper role that made him so effective. This might be something worth trying away at Watford, where he can provide invaluable invention and control; Granit Xhaka should be able to supply sufficient steel, such that the limited Francis Coquelin is not required. And while Wenger is still searching for his most potent attacking blend, whichever players he selects will find it easier if Cazorla is scheming behind them. <strong>Daniel Harris</strong></p> <blockquote> <ul> <li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/aug/25/arsenal-set-to-beat-everton-to-signing-of-lucas-perez\">Arsenal set to beat Everton to signing of Lucas from Deportivo</a></li> <li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/aug/25/arsenal-agree-35m-fee-with-valencia-for-shkodran-mustafi\">Arsenal agree \u00a335m fee with Valencia for Shkodran Mustafi</a></li> </ul> </blockquote> <h2><strong>5) Will the real Mahrez turn up?</strong><br></h2> <p>Remember the concern when Jamie Vardy was sent off during Leicester City\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/apr/17/leicester-city-west-ham-united-premier-league-match-report\">controversial 2-2 draw</a> with West Ham United in April? Yet the expectation that Claudio Ranieri would struggle without their biggest goal threat failed to account for the influence of the majestic Riyad Mahrez, who calmed any lingering nerves by scoring a lovely, authoritative opener in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/apr/24/leicester-swansea-city-premier-league-match-report\">Leicester\u2019s 4-0 win</a> over Swansea City a week later. That swaggering finish was proof of the Algerian winger\u2019s class, one of the highlights of a stupendous season. However it appears that the hangover has not quite worn off yet, with Leicester picking up a point from their first two matches. Perhaps it is unfair to pick Mahrez out. He did score a penalty against Hull and several Leicester players have started the campaign slowly. Vardy has snatched at a few chances and the defence has looked shaky at times. Yet the level Mahrez is capable of reaching means that any dip in form will always stand out; Leicester are a vastly superior side when he is in the mood. Swansea are back at the King Power Stadium on Saturday and Francesco Guidolin\u2019s side will be in trouble if Mahrez regains his sharpness. <strong>JS</strong></p> <blockquote> <ul> <li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/aug/25/danny-drinkwater-signs-five-year-deal-with-leicester-city\">Drinkwater signs five-year deal with Leicester</a></li> </ul> </blockquote>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/video/2016/aug/26/claudio-ranieri-leicester-champions-league-gift-for-all-involved-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/5xckd\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2686189\"            data-video-name=\"Claudio Ranieri: Leicester in Champions League is a gift for all involved \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"AP\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-57c007abe4b0486629890455\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/08/26/160826RanieriPresser2_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/08/26/160826RanieriPresser2.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/08/26/160826RanieriPresser2_WebM.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/video/2016/aug/26/claudio-ranieri-leicester-champions-league-gift-for-all-involved-video\">Claudio Ranieri: Leicester in Champions League is a gift for all involved</a></figcaption> </figure>   <h2>6) Will Conte combine Costa with Batshuayi?<br></h2> <p>Chelsea have made an excellent start to the season; nothing compares to the joy of a late winner, and they have conjured <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/aug/20/watford-chelsea-premier-league-match-report\">two in two games</a>. But the model is unsustainable; teams who are regularly involved in close encounters are rarely champions.

The other side to their six points so far reveals a side struggling to penetrate.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-table element--supporting\" data-canonical-url=\"https://frontend.gutools.co.uk/admin/football/player/card/competition/attack/370300/4/100\"> <div data-embed-type=\"table\" class=\"player-card player-card--football\" itemscope=\"\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\"> <div class=\"player-card__image-container\"> <img class=\"player-card__image\" itemprop=\"image\" src=\"https://sport.guim.co.uk/football/player-images/100/370300.jpg\" alt=\"Photo of Diego Costa\"> </div> <div class=\"player-card__player\"> <div class=\"player-card__position\" itemprop=\"jobTitle\">Striker</div> <div class=\"player-card__name\" itemprop=\"name\">Diego Costa</div> </div> <dl class=\"player-card__stats\"> <dt class=\"player-card__stat-name\">Appearances</dt> <dd class=\"player-card__stat-value\">2</dd>  <dt class=\"player-card__stat-name\">Goals</dt> <dd class=\"player-card__stat-value\">2</dd>  <dt class=\"player-card__stat-name\">Shots</dt> <dd class=\"player-card__stat-value\">4</dd>  <dt class=\"player-card__stat-name\">Shots on target</dt> <dd class=\"player-card__stat-value\">75%</dd>  <dt class=\"player-card__stat-name\">Offsides</dt> <dd class=\"player-card__stat-value\">2</dd> </dl> </div> </figure>  <p>Much as Antonio Conte likes a system, it is time for him to find a way of pairing Michy Batshuayi with Diego Costa, in order to compensate for the relative absence of transcendental talent. Batshuayi is dynamic, well-rounded, tough to mark \u2013 and, most importantly, in scoring form. For the majority of strikers, this is not a constant, so full advantage must be taken whenever it occurs. The likelihood may be that Chelsea win at home to Burnley whoever starts up front, but they also need to find a way to win the league. That requires the top or second-top scorer, a feat which looks well beyond a front three of Eden Hazard, Diego Costa and Pedro or Willian. <strong>DH</strong></p> <blockquote> <ul> <li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/aug/25/milan-reject-chelseas-35m-offer-for-alessio-romagnoli\">Milan reject Chelsea\u2019s \u00a335m offer for Romagnoli</a></li> <li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/aug/23/andre-gray-charged-misconduct-homophobic-tweets\">Gray charged by FA over 2012 homophobic tweets</a></li> <li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/aug/25/chelsea-patrick-bamford-burnley-loan\">Bamford joins Burnley on season-long loan</a></li> </ul> </blockquote> <h2>7) Lukaku returns on hunt for scoring touch</h2> <p>Yannick Bolasie and Ashley Williams could make their Premier League debuts for Everton this weekend but the outcome of the joust with Stoke could depend to a large extent on the performance of a player who seemed to spend much of the summer trying to leave Goodison Park. Romelu Lukaku has not scored in the league since early March and needs to regain his form of last year if he is to contribute fully to Everton\u2019s progress under Ronald Koeman and/or persuade another club that he is a major investment worth making. Stoke have not yet resolved their defensive problems so the Belgian can expect to get chances to end his drought. Mark Hughes, meanwhile, has yet to sign the reliable striker whom he has been seeking all summer but can at least refer to last season\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/dec/28/everton-stoke-city-premier-league-match-report\">wonderful 4-3 victory</a> in this fixture as evidence of what his team are capable of when on song. <strong>PD</strong></p> <blockquote> <ul> <li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/aug/23/phil-jones-manchester-united-stoke-city\">Jones to stay at Manchester United despite Stoke interest</a></li> </ul> </blockquote> <h2>8) Benteke must bring quick reward for Pardew<br></h2> <p>For Christian Benteke and Alan Pardew there can be no more excuses: big improvement must come soon. With some justification the manager has attributed most of the blame for his team\u2019s appalling run of results \u2013 two wins and 16 defeats from their last 23 Premier League matches \u2013 to bad finishing and has been allowed to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/aug/20/crystal-palace-sign-christian-benteke-liverpool\">break Crystal Palace\u2019s transfer record</a> in an effort to address that. Thus Benteke will probably make his league debut for Palace at home to Bournemouth on Saturday. He should do well for a team that is designed to play to his formidable strengths: Palace were the third-most prolific crossers in the top-flight last season and have been the second-most prolific in the early stages of this one. In addition to deliveries from wide areas, Palace should have more creativity from central midfield as James McArthur and Yohan Cabaye are fit to start again after injuries (although Cabaye\u2019s performances in the second half of last season hardly merit a rapid return to the starting lineup). If he gets regular starts and good service, Benteke should thrive. His reputation and Pardew\u2019s job may depend on it. <strong>PD</strong></p> <blockquote> <ul> <li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/aug/25/crystal-palace-reject-tottenham-hotspurs-bid-for-wilfried-zaha\">Palace reject Tottenham\u2019s \u00a315m bid for Zaha</a></li> <li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/aug/20/crystal-palace-sign-christian-benteke-liverpool\">Palace sign Liverpool\u2019s Benteke for \u00a327m on four-year deal</a></li> </ul> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ef9e6c7c8e23db5807e19b75013d8a7a8a9683c4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ef9e6c7c8e23db5807e19b75013d8a7a8a9683c4/0_45_2288_1373/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Christian Benteke\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Christian Benteke had his first taste of action in a Crystal Palace shirt against Blackpool at Selhurst Park in the EFL Cup second round.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Zemanek/Rex Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>9) Moyes should look on the bright side<br></h2> <p>David Moyes is an excellent fit as the Sunderland manager; he is proven as an astute spotter of talent, and also able to sustain control of a club for an extended period of time. But <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/aug/23/david-moyes-lamine-kone-sunderland\">his recent comments</a> about Sunderland \u2013 that they were irrevocably in a relegation struggle; that he was appointed too late and can\u2019t be expected to effect immediate change; that it\u2019s going to be difficult \u2013 were troubling.There were similar gripes when Moyes took charge at Manchester United, reigning champions at the time, and even since then he has insisted that given his time again, he would do nothing differently. Or, put another way, it was impossible for him to apprehend or admit to making but a single error.</p> <p>None of this is necessary. Sunderland have done well to get him and will give him time to succeed; in the first instance, all he needs to do is keep them up, or show signs of progress while going down. So there is nothing to be gained by implicitly demeaning a group of players who did superbly at the end of last season; people tend to perform better when feeling good about themselves, rather than as the unwitting subjects of a story that needn\u2019t have existed. And though it is facile to connect the <a href=\"http://Sunderland\u2019s high-press leaves shaky defence exposed against Middlesbrough\">supine first-half performance</a> against Middlesbrough with anything Moyes said prior to it, they must be better at Southampton. Moyes must still fortify a young, physically unimposing squad with the belief that they can do anything, not that they will only be complete once he has had requisite time to form them. <strong>DH</strong></p> <blockquote> <ul> <li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/aug/25/david-moyes-sunderland-steven-pienaar-premier-league\">Moyes will get it right at Sunderland, says Pienaar</a></li> <li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/aug/25/javier-manquillo-sunderland-loan-atletico-madrid-liverpool\">Manquillo joins Sunderland on season-long loan from Atl\u00e9tico</a></li> </ul> </blockquote> <h2><strong>10) Will Middlesbrough miss Valdes?</strong></h2> <p>If V\u00edctor Vald\u00e9s is sidelined again with the hamstring problem that kept him out of Middlesbrough\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/aug/21/sunderland-middlesbrough-premier-league-match-report\">impressive win</a> over Sunderland, then it could mean another start in goal for Brad Guzan. Aitor Karanka chose him as Vald\u00e9s\u2019s deputy instead of the 37-year-old Dimitrios Konstantopoulos and that might might be encouraging news for West Bromwich Albion. Guzan was arguably at fault for Sunderland\u2019s goal and the American did not exactly inspire confidence in his defenders during his time as Aston Villa\u2019s No1. He will need to be commanding against West Brom, with Tony Pulis\u2019s side likely to pressure Middlesbrough in the air. <strong>JS</strong></p> <blockquote> <ul> <li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/aug/23/west-bromwich--jonny-evans-not-leaving\">West Brom tell Evans he will not be sold this window</a></li> </ul> </blockquote>",

  "<p>Imagine the dinner party from hell. Excruciating guests, the most well-adjusted of whom \u201ctried to kill himself but only a little bit\u201d. A goulash made in anger, offensive conversation about the Gestapo and Dorset, and a row that ends with a wine bottle smashed over a smug, middle-class head. The polite horror of sharing a meal with people who are awful but perhaps \u2013 shudder \u2013 a little bit like you was the premise of <strong>The Circuit</strong> (Channel 4), a surreal comedy pilot written by Sharon Horgan and Dennis Kelly.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2015/dec/16/rob-delaney-and-sharon-horgan-catastrophe-roundup\">Rob Delaney and Sharon Horgan: \u2018He rubs my corners off and I try to kick some of the sweetness out of him\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Gabe (Adeel Akhtar) and Nat (Eva Birthistle) are new to the neighbourhood, which remains unnamed but is clearly some aspirational hellhole lined with houses in which soft-close kitchen units, two-person showers and barely contained madness reside. We meet them outside pondering whether their hosts are \u201cour kind of people\u201d. Yes, probably, but this is no good thing. Anyway, the unwritten law of dinner parties dictates that they will have to ask them back. \u201cAnd then what?\u201d Gabe whines. \u201cThen we\u2019re friends. Friends of people who aren\u2019t our friends.\u201d</p> <p>And who would want to be friends with Helene (Victoria Hamilton) and her husband Sasha (Tobias Menzies): rage-filled, and unhappy, mostly because Sasha has booked a holiday in Dorset without telling Helene. Also imprisoned in the domestic nightmare are Marty (Nicola Walker), who used to be in Bananarama, her girlfriend Angie (Desiree Akhavan), who works for a company making \u201cwar bullets but we don\u2019t call them war bullets\u201d, and the suicidal one (Paul Ready).</p> <p>Dinner parties are a classic trope. From Alice in Wonderland to Abigail\u2019s Party, Macbeth to Meet the Parents, three courses have been cooked in the name of satire, revelation, or an excuse for a massive barney. They function in the opposite way to the episode in a TV series when the main characters are stuck in a lift. A good Bad Dinner Party is mainly about what\u2019s not said: the masking of feelings and the disturbing sound of forks scraping against teeth more than the unravelling. This is where The Circuit failed: it was all tell and no show. When Sasha announced that \u201cI didn\u2019t want them to come\u201d before the main course had arrived and Gabe ordered them to \u201cstart talking to each other like human beings\u201d, all I could think was that this would never happen at a dinner party. No matter how dire it got, you would still be asking your host to pass the salt rather than behave himself.</p> <p>Also it wasn\u2019t very funny, which is the biggest faux pas of all. A couple of lines induced a courteous smile, such as when Gabe protested he wasn\u2019t a Nazi because \u201cI\u2019ve got Tony Benn\u2019s autobiography\u201d and Sasha batted back: \u201cBut you haven\u2019t read it, have you?\u201d Or when Gabe asked for Helene\u2019s goulash recipe and she replied: \u201cWhy would I do that? Then you can make my fucking goulash.\u201d Mostly though this was comedy more matcha-tea-stained than black.</p> <p>Horgan and Kelly\u2019s last series together was the hilarious and big-hearted Pulling, written a decade ago. Their trademark is scabrous, filthy comedy that skewers the middle classes without making you completely hate them (or perhaps yourself). Biting but tender, too, like a well-hung steak. My expectations were high but by the end of The Circuit, they were dashed. I was drained, I hated everyone, and I wanted to run away and watch Stranger Things. It was just like going to a really bad dinner party.</p> <p>Thankfully <strong>Horizon: My Amazing Twin</strong> (BBC2) restored my faith in humanity. Adam and Neil Pearson, identical twins who share the same genetic disease, neurofibromatosis 1 (Nf1), set out on a quest to find out why they have different symptoms. Adam, a perky and droll broadcaster (\u201cI\u2019m a really shit superhero!\u201d), is severely facially disfigured and has had 32 surgeries to remove tumours that are blinding him. Neil has short-term memory loss. No one knows why, and over the course of this gentle documentary, the twins spoke to confounded consultants, had MRI scans, and confronted their disease with humour and grace. Adam visited Vietnam, which has the most NF1 cases in the world, and learned that \u201cgenetic diseases affect us differently, depending on where we live\u201d. In Vietnam, he said, \u201cyou\u2019re lucky to get a diagnosis, let alone treatment\u201d. It was a brave and generous investigation that found no real answers but was consoling nonetheless. \u201cIf I\u2019m dying I\u2019d quite like a heads up,\u201d Adam said over dinner with their unflappable mum. \u201cMe too,\u201d agreed Neil. \u201cAnd the good thing about memory loss is you can always forget.\u201d Their mother probed further: \u201cWhat\u2019s the gain in knowing?\u201d \u201cKnowing,\u201d Adam immediately replied. If only all dinner parties were this nourishing.</p>",

Do senior academics not realise that we talk to each other, and that they are earning themselves reputations as predators to be avoided? You don\u2019t want to be the last one left in the pub with them and you never, ever agree to share a taxi.

As journals become more and more specialised, it is not difficult to work out whose writing you are peer-reviewing. The networks come into play again.

Never. Never. Never. Hong Kong cannot ever be independent,\u201d Pepper said. \u201cBut it\u2019s very important that people in Hong Kong understand what is happening ... Beijing is trying to take over. Beijing is trying to integrate this political system with the mainland so it will become \u2018one country, one system\u2019.</p> <p>\u201cThe message [from the independence movement] is: we want China to leave us alone,\u201d she added. \u201cAnd if enough people keep making this argument then Beijing will have to listen.\u201d</p> <p>Proponents of independence say they have no roadmap for what they admit will be an extremely long and unpredictable hike to freedom.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know the exact time.

  "<p>Early pioneers of the \u201cdigital detox\u201d imagined it as a holiday, where you shook off the shackles of your BlackBerry, the office and the boss who sends you emails at 10pm. Those days, like the lingo around them (who says \u201cCrackBerry\u201d anymore?), have long passed.</p> <p>Our devices are now so close to our marrow that to take them away for a week leaves one not just with the sense of a removed organ, but something else \u2013 a sort of existential dread, or even terror. It\u2019s Fomo, but through a glass darkly. We are afraid of missing out, not on the fun stuff but on some bleak piece of information about the world \u2013 another terrorist attack, the rise of some new evil group, another record-breaking gun massacre \u2013 that forms another strand of our central narrative.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/05/digital-detox-using-internet-mindfully\">A digital detox sounds great. But using the internet mindfully is better | Emily Reynolds</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Imagine what can happen to the world in a day: the wars that can be started, the planes that can be disappeared, the bombs and the coups and the leadership changes. Maybe after a week we will have a new prime minister. Maybe the rockstar we thought immortal will suddenly be dead.</p> <p>Last week I went camping in the west of Cape York, Australia, in a place where you need a generator for electricity and a week can go by without seeing anyone except for road gangs. There was no phone or internet signal. There was no point even trying.</p> <p>Now I am in the country in an internet blackspot, where to get even one bar of reception means walking to the top of a hill and holding my phone aloft as though I\u2019m peaking at a Bon Jovi concert or Donald Trump rally. I have become marooned on a digital desert island.</p> <p>It must be bliss, you say. Well actually, no. It\u2019s filled with dread and anxiety, and a strange sense of being out of space and time.</p> <p>This is what you think about when you have no phone or internet:</p> <h2>1. Someone you love has died</h2> <p>Because you cannot be reached, you assume something awful has happened; someone out there is trying to contact you to tell you that your family is dead. All week you imagine that first email, text or Facebook message informing you: your entire family \u2013 dead.</p> <p>To assume that everyone you love is likely deceased because you do not have the internet is to ascribe yet another dark, magical power to Wi-Fi, as if the lack of coverage itself could be responsible. Relief floods you like a chemical when you get signal again: not only has no one actually died this week but now they will be protected from death \u2013 because you have the internet back.</p> <h2>2. Someone famous has died</h2> <p>The cycle of death and public mourning is so intense and fast these days that you could be without internet for four nights, return to Twitter, and not know that Madonna is gone. People will have changed their profile photos to shots of her circa-1980s and then changed them back again; they will have already posted the videos of Borderline and pictures of the flowers and the tributes, the conical bras left outside the dance studio in Hell\u2019s Kitchen. </p> <p>You\u2019ll have missed the TV special and the Facebook tears; the radio stations will have played 24 hours of Madonna and then resumed normal programming. You will only find out that Madonna has died when she flashes up in the in memorium section of the 2017 Academy Awards.</p> <p>That is what you imagine, anyway. But you don\u2019t know, and there is no way of knowing, because you are away from the internet for a week.</p> <h2>3. A big news event has happened</h2> <p>In Cape York at night under a big sky, we sat around the fire. One of the traditional owners of the land, a stockman called Johnny, played guitar as dingoes howled from somewhere. We talked not about the music or the night, but about what if, like, September 11 was happening <em>right now</em>, and we didn\u2019t know. What would it feel like when we got our phone signal back, and found out that while the world was ending we were singing Jolene by the campfire?</p> <p>Later on when people ask, \u201cWhere were you on August 20?\u201d, you will say, \u201cI had no internet! I had no internet that week, and I DIDN\u2019T EVEN KNOW THAT AUGUST 20 HAPPENED.\u201d</p> <p>And they will just shake their heads, because they have no words.</p> <h2>4. Your online avatars are idle and unprotected</h2> <p>Imagine flicking a hand-knitted finger puppet on to a football field and letting the most aggressive players in the league trample on it.</p> <p>When you are offline for a week, your avatar \u2013 you, it\u2019s really you, a version of you \u2013 is the discarded puppet. And left alone in the cagefight that is Twitter, it is unguarded. </p> <p>Without you looking out for it, it may be subject to slights, trolling, abuse, mockery and/or a pile-on. This will cause initial anxiety \u2013 who is hurting me this week, when I am not there to defend myself? \u2013 but later, you may feel liberation. Maybe your puppet self <em>is</em> being torn to shreds on the interwebs, but there is nothing you can do about it because you are not there.</p> <h2>5. Your best relationships are virtual</h2> <p>You could go all night texting him. You could lose hours on Facebook messenger, you could have the most emotionally charged conversation using only emojis, you could have mindblowing sex via Gmail chat. You could, you could, oh yes you could \u2013 if only you were online. </p> <p>Offline, though, you are restricted to interacting with people in your immediate physical space using actual words and body language.</p> <p>People who talk about the 1960s as the era of sexual liberation clearly don\u2019t have a smartphone and Wi-Fi.</p> <h2>6. Your life is better without Facebook</h2> <p>Facebook is the digital equivalent of attending a children\u2019s birthday party while being lectured at by your most sanctimonious leftie friend and trolled by your rightwing brother-in-law, before you are door-knocked for a charity fun run while your worst neighbour brags about his promotion and children and forces you to watch slides from a horrifyingly successful friend\u2019s holiday to Fiji.</p> <p>So perhaps you won\u2019t miss it.</p> <h2>7. Being offline doesn\u2019t make you a morally better person</h2> <p>There is a notion common to all detoxes that without the \u201ctoxic\u201d substance in our life we are not only physically healthier but somehow morally healthier too.</p> <p>But I found that being offline doesn\u2019t make you a better person \u2013 it just makes you a more contained one. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2015/dec/26/digital-detox-holidays-turn-off-shut-down-log-out\">Turn off, shut down, log out: the digital detox holiday is here</a> </p> </aside>  <p>You\u2019re not leaking your energy all over the place with your likes and your retweets and your status updates, your signalling of your virtues and flagging of your disasters. While you may initially be more anxious at the removal of the stimulus, there is more space to focus on the things that are happening to you in real life as opposed to those online.</p> <h2>8. The best bit is the silence</h2> <p>I felt the dead phone dance in my pocket like a phantom limb. I imagined catastrophes happening to the people l love best. I assumed the downfall of at least two or three civilisations, and one new war. I had killed Madonna in my mind. </p> <p>But under it all lay a silence so beautiful and pure that the digital noise became like relentless waves roiling across the surface of a fathomless ocean. To not be constantly sending your signals out \u2013 the statuses and retweets and likes, the alerts and lights flashing like a boat in perpetual distress \u2013 to just sit and roll back into yourself, and to return home.

We\u2019re living in her head rent-free, and that must terrify the political insiders who want to keep things exactly they way they are.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57bf6518e4b0fe30498a4cdf\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-08-25T21:42:35.007Z\">10.42pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Donald Trump continues to muddy immigration stance</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>In a preview of remarks to be made tonight on CNN\u2019s AC360, Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump told host Anderson Cooper that the \u201csoftening\u201d of his immigration plan does not include a path to legalization - \u201cunless people leave the country\u201d and pay back taxes.</p> <p>\u201cNo, there\u2019s not a path to legalization unless people leave the country,\u201d Trump told Cooper, in remarks set to air at 8pm ET. \u201cIf they come back in and then they have to start paying taxes, but there is no path to legalization unless they leave the country and come back.\u201d</p> <p>Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway told CNN on Tuesday that there would be no \u201ctouchback\u201d policy in Trump\u2019s future - that is, undocumented immigrants leaving the country for their nation of origin before entering the United States legally.</p> <p>Trump also doubled down on remarks he made last night, calling rival Hillary Clinton a \u201cbigot\u201d who only views African Americans as votes to be won.</p> <p>\u201cShe is a bigot,\u201d Trump said. \u201cIf you look at what\u2019s happening to the inner cities, you look at what\u2019s happening to African Americans and Hispanics in this country where she talks all the time. She talking - look at the vets, where she said the vets are being treated essentially just fine that it\u2019s over-exaggerated what\u2019s happening to the vets not so long ago.\u201d</p> <p>Asked to elaborate - Trump\u2019s definition of bigotry appears to be different than Cooper\u2019s - Trump said that Clinton is bigoted because \u201cshe is selling them down the tubes because she\u2019s not doing anything for those communities. She talks a good game. But she doesn\u2019t do anything.\u201d</p> <p>Asked whether Clinton is personally bigoted, Trump said yes.</p> <p>\u201cOh, she is,\u201d Trump said. \u201cOf course she is. Her policies. They\u2019re her policies, she comes out with the policies and others that believe like she does also but she came out with policies over the years. This is over the years. Long time.

Until now.\u201d<br></p> <p>By billing the speech as a takedown of \u201cTrump\u2019s divisive \u2018alt-right\u2019 candidacy\u201d, her campaign shined a light on a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/23/alt-right-movement-white-identity-breitbart-donald-trump\">little-known slice of the political spectrum</a>: an amorphous, largely online movement that prefers the label \u201crace realist\u201d to \u201cwhite supremacist\u201d.</p> <p>Not only has Trump insulted African Americans and Latinos from the campaign trail, but by aligning himself with Brietbart, Clinton said Thursday, he hooked up with a media outlet that the Southern Poverty Law Center says \u201cembraces ideas on the extremist fringe of the conservative right\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThis is not conservatism as we have known it,\u201d she continued. \u201cThis is not Republicanism as we have known it.

I sat next to the ACL\u2019s Lyle Shelton on the ABC\u2019s Q&amp;A program while he accused same sex parents of ripping babies away from their mother\u2019s breast. Apart from the obvious conflating of two unrelated issues (marriage and procreation), he knows my story, yet he felt he could say that on national television without a hint of embarrassment. He went on to use primary school aged children and their families struggling painfully with gender identity as another stalking horse for his anti-marriage equality obsession.</p> <p>Over the past year I have had to hear complete nonsense spoken about our relationships and our families. If I can be offended and upset by these sorts of comments, I ask myself what about the effect on people who are less battle-hardened, less resilient?</p> <p>Just recently I read a <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/religion/11299263/Christian-teenager-takes-her-own-life-over-misplaced-fears-about-telling-family-she-is-gay.html\">distressing story about a teenager</a> in the UK, Lizzie Lowe. At the age of 14 she hanged herself in a local park. An inquest into her death heard that she feared telling her devoutly Christian parents she might be gay. She had reportedly confided in friends that she was struggling to reconcile her feelings with her own deep faith.</p> <p>She was worried about telling her parents, but her father said her fears were misplaced and she would have received a \u201cwealth of love and acceptance\u201d. Sadly, the subliminal messages she had been receiving about her family and her faith created a potent fear of rejection and she was apparently unaware that her parents would, they said, have been very supportive.</p> <p>For young people struggling with this core issue of identity, there is great emotional vulnerability. According to beyondblue, same-sex attracted Australians have up to <a href=\"https://www.beyondblue.org.au/docs/default-source/default-document-library/bw0258-lgbti-mental-health-and-suicide-2013-2nd-edition.pdf?sfvrsn=2\">14 times higher rates of suicide attempts</a> than their heterosexual peers. The average age of a first suicide attempt is 16 years \u2013 often before \u201ccoming out\u201d.</p> <p>Subliminal messages are tough enough to combat, but a plebiscite is declaring open season on the LGBT community for negative views about same sex relationships, the relative value of our love and the quality of our parenting.</p> <p>As a doctor, I am deeply concerned about the damage to self-worth and the fear of rejection which can arise from a public \u201cno\u201d campaign against marriage equality.</p> <p>We are told that a debate about marriage equality can be \u201crespectful\u201d. Imagine if you got engaged, but before you could get married, you had to hear months of arguments about why you did not deserve to be married, and why you and your partner would not make good parents. It cuts deep.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jul/29/lessons-from-ireland-is-it-possible-to-have-respectful-disagreement-on-marriage-equality\">Lessons from Ireland: is it possible to have respectful disagreement on marriage equality? | Gay Alcorn</a> </p> </aside>  <p>By its very nature, such a debate cannot be \u201crespectful\u201d.

In the process it will unleash a barrage of bigotry and negativity dressed up as \u201cdebate\u201d.</p> <p>The ban on same sex marriage which was inserted into the Marriage Act by the Howard government in 2004 needs to be removed by a simple act of Parliament to bring us into line with the rest of the western developed world.</p> <p>Our elected representatives can block the plebiscite bill in the Senate, and put marriage equality to a free vote in parliament.</p> <p>As time goes on, the intensity of the \u201cno\u201d campaign will only increase and do more damage. This is messing with real people\u2019s lives. </p>",
  "<p>\u201cI have lumps in my breasts, in my throat, and in my uterus.\u201d Halimeh spoke softly, but as she quickly uttered these words, I noticed an immense sadness in her dark brown eyes. We were sitting on the rocks near the ocean, wary of wild dogs barking nearby, and melting in the scorching heat of this remote Pacific island. I could feel her fear, so common for any woman in her 30s who checks her breasts in the morning and knows something isn\u2019t right.</p> <p>Halimeh fled Iran three years ago, after she said several of her friends got executed there, because they converted to Christianity, something that she wanted to do as well. She aimed for Australia \u2013 a country where she was hoping to find peace and freedom from religious persecution.</p> <p>Instead, after a gruelling journey through Malaysia and Indonesia, a dangerous ocean crossing on a smuggler\u2019s boat, and six months in immigration detention on Australia\u2019s Christmas Island, she got sent to Nauru \u2013 a tiny, remote island state where Australia has been for years banishing asylum seekers trying to reach its shores.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/22/the-claim-that-locking-asylum-seekers-up-in-nauru-and-png-saves-lives-is-bogus\">The claim that locking asylum seekers up in Nauru and PNG saves lives is bogus | Philippe Legrain</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Like many people around the world, I was repulsed last week by the sheer scale and inhumanity of the abuses and neglect documented in the Guardian\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/series/nauru-files\">Nauru files</a> expos\u00e9.</p> <p>But for me the leaks struck a particular chord since I had only last month witnessed these patterns of horrendous abuse with my own eyes. It brought back the thoughts about Halimeh and the other 57 people I interviewed during the week I spent on the island. Women, men and children with personal stories to make even the most emotionless readers shudder; people who fled wars, who lost family members and friends, who were tortured by repressive regimes, and who are now stuck on Nauru, in anguish and despair about their future.</p> <p>More than 1,200 women, men and children from countries such as Iran, Iraq, Pakistan, Somalia, Bangladesh, Kuwait, Afghanistan, spent months or years in appalling conditions in a detention camp funded by Australia. They lived in crowded, mouldy tents, where guards conducted regular, prison-like searches, and limited their showers to two minutes, before forcing them out.</p> <p>With no prospect of leaving this impoverished island \u2013 which is smaller than many airports I have travelled through \u2013 these hundreds of people are effectively facing a future of indefinite, arbitrary detention. As a result, they are breaking down physically and emotionally. Although I\u2019ve worked in most of the conflict zones around the world over the past 15 years, I have never seen such high rates of mental trauma, self-harm, and suicide attempts, among children as well as adults.</p> <p>Health problems are simply not being addressed. I spoke with people who suffered several heart attacks, major complications from diabetes, kidney diseases, untreated broken bones, and infections. In most cases, they only got blood tests and Panadol.</p> <p>Halimeh told me that in 2014 she was sent to Melbourne, and spent four months there, between an immigration detention camp and a hospital. \u201cMy doctor said I need surgery for my breasts,\u201d she said, her gaze fixated on the ocean in front of us. \u201cHe said I cannot go back [to Nauru], but the immigration decided to bring me back anyway.\u201d Her condition continued to deteriorate \u2013 in 2015 they sent her to Papua New Guinea for an endoscopy and a colonoscopy, which confirmed some of her medical problems ... and sent her back to Nauru again.</p> <p>Now the lumps are growing and she has a worrisome discharge from her breasts but Australia is denying her treatment or even a proper check-up.</p> <p>As unthinkable and inhumane as it sounds, this neglect appears to be part of life on Nauru. Australian politicians have been adamant that they will never allow the refugees sent to Nauru to settle in Australia. \u201cI feel they keep us as hostages,\u201d Halimeh said. \u201cThey make us suffer as an example to others who might think of fleeing to Australia.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/aug/10/the-nauru-files-2000-leaked-reports-reveal-scale-of-abuse-of-children-in-australian-offshore-detention\">The Nauru files: cache of 2,000 leaked reports reveal scale of abuse of children in Australian offshore detention</a> </p> </aside>  <p>What\u2019s worse, as remote as Nauru is, it\u2019s actually much closer than one might think \u2013 right-wing European politicians have been touting the \u201cAustralian model\u201d of offshore asylum processing as a solution to the European refugee \u201ccrisis\u201d. Under the same pretext of \u201csaving lives,\u201d European countries are already closing borders, striking deals with states, such as Turkey, that cannot offer refugees adequate protection, and outsourcing their responsibilities.</p> <p>The latest detailed exposure of what this \u201cAustralian model\u201d is like in reality, which has received extensive coverage in Europe, is significant. For hundreds of refugees in Australia\u2019s offshore prisons, it brings renewed hope that Australia will finally fulfil its international obligations and allow them to settle in a place where they can get the assistance they need and the protection they deserve.</p> <p>For Halimeh, it means she might still get vital surgery and treatment before it\u2019s too late. And for any European state contemplating similar measures, it is a clear warning of just how wrong things go when fear and populist agendas are allowed to trample core humanitarian values and the international right to seek asylum.</p> <p><em>Anna Neistat is a senior director of research at Amnesty International. </em></p>"
