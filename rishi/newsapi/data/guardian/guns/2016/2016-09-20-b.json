Underlining their fears, congressmen last night attempted to push through legislation that would grant sitting lawmakers amnesty.</p> <p>The implications go far beyond the trial itself. Ana Claudia Farranha, a law professor at the University of Brasilia, said the legal case \u2013 although contentious \u2013 will distract Da Silva and complicate the next presidential election in which he is the frontrunner. </p> <p>Ultimately, she said, it could lead to a realignment of political parties.<br>\u201cThe fence is closing around Lula,\u201d said Farranha. </p> <p>\u201cAs the investigations progress, Lula weakens.

A number of participants were also asked to complete an exercise to gauge their pain tolerance - the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/jun/19/do-you-have-lots-of-friends-you-probably-have-a-high-pain-threshold\">wall-sit test</a>, involving squatting with their back against a wall for as long as possible. </p> <p>With increased levels of pain tolerance linked to the release of potent pain-killing chemicals known as endorphins, the test offered scientists an indirect way of gauging changes to endorphin levels in the brain.</p> <p>\u201cWhat one wants to know is does your response to one film change in a different way to your response to the other,\u201d said Dunbar.</p> <p>The results reveal that those who watched the traumatic film had, on average, a strong negative change to their mood, while those who watched the documentaries showed only a slight change in both positive and negative markers, which the researchers attribute to boredom.</p> <p>They also found that, on average, the pain tolerance of those who watched the traumatic movie increased by 13.1%, whereas those who watched the documentaries experienced a decrease in pain threshold of 4.6%. The upshot is that the traumatic film boosted pain thresholds by nearly 18% compared to the \u201ccontrol\u201d scenario. What\u2019s more, those who showed an increase in pain tolerance also had increased feelings of group bonding, despite their mood becoming less positive.</p> <p>But not everyone showed an emotional response to Stuart: A life backwards. Some viewers showed a decrease in pain threshold, together with no change in their social bonding.</p> <p>\u201cThis is probably true of everyday life - some people get very moved emotionally by some event that happens while other people look blankly on and say \u2018what is the fuss?\u2019\u201d said Dunbar.</p> <p>While further research is needed to look at a wider range of films and other influences, such as musical scores, Dunbar says the results suggest that watching traumatic films increases endorphin levels in the brain, boosting pain tolerance and increasing the sense of bonding with others in the group.</p> <p>Prof Sophie Scott, group leader of the speech communication neuroscience group at the Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience, University College London, said it was striking that traumatic films, like laughter, appear to produce a social bonding effect.</p> <p>\u201cIt suggests that it not simply [with] positive emotions that you have this bonding effect - maybe there is something about a shared emotional experience which is really changing how your endorphins are being taken up and making you feel closer to people,\u201d she said, adding that exploring the effects of anger or <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/commentisfree/2016/jun/21/donald-trump-politics-of-disgust\">disgust</a> could help to tease apart whether the effect was down to particular emotions, or rather the sharing of them.</p> <p>But Scott, who wasn\u2019t involved in the research, said she isn\u2019t convinced that Dunbar and colleagues have discovered the foundations of our love of storytelling. \u201cStories are everything for humans - if we can fit something into a story we will do. We understand things better if they fit to stories, we remember things better if they fit to stories,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t know if you are going account for that simply with shared emotions.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>People with a gene linked to weight gain are just as likely to benefit from weight loss programmes as those without, researchers have discovered.</p> <p>The findings suggest diet, exercise and drug-based approaches to losing weight can be widely beneficial, even if some people may have a greater risk of piling on the pounds due to their genetics. In short, your DNA is not a barrier to weight loss.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2016/mar/08/genetic-study-shows-mens-height-and-womens-weight-drive-earning-power\">Genetic study shows men's height and women's weight drive earning power</a> </p> </aside>  <p>While many genes are believed to affect body weight, a particular version of the so-called FTO gene shows one of the strongest associations with fat gain. Those carrying two copies of the genetic variant \u2013 about 16% of the population \u2013 are on average 3kg heavier than those without, and 1.7 times more likely to be obese.</p> <p>While it is not known exactly how the genetic variant promotes weight gain, it is believed to increase the appeal of high-calorie foods and reduce the feeling of fullness after a meal. But whether it also affects efforts to shed pounds has been a matter of debate.</p> <p>\u201cIt has become clear that genetics play a part in the reason why some of us get fatter,\u201d said John Mathers, lead author of the research from Newcastle University. \u201cThe one that has the biggest effect in most people is the FTO gene, so we wondered whether having the [high-risk version of the] FTO gene would affect how well you could lose weight.\u201d</p> <p>Writing in the <a href=\"http://www.bmj.com/content/354/bmj.i4707 \">British Medical Journal</a>, Mathers and an international team of collaborators describe how they analysed eight previously published randomised control trials involving a total of more than 9,500 overweight or obese adults to investigate whether carrying the obesity-linked version of the FTO gene affects the ability to lose weight.</p> <p>In all of the studies, the participants were tested to discover whether they carried the genetic variant, and whether they had one copy or two, but the results were not disclosed to the participants.

The UN has insisted there are no forced returns.</p> <p>At a later summit on refugees, hosted by US president Barack Obama, May said another \u00a380m from the aid budget will be aimed at helping migrants, largely Eritreans, stay in Ethiopia through the financial support for the construction of new industrial parks offering 100,000 new jobs, including 30,000 for refugees. </p> <p>This is an expansion of the programme used in Jordan, Turkey and Lebanon to try encourage refugees settle in the region rather than make journeys to European countries.</p> <p>Of the 124,000 refugees who crossed the Mediterranean to Italy between Jan 2016 and 12 Sept, 12% were Eritrean - second only to Nigeria who made up 20% of the numbers crossing.</p> <p>At the Obama summit, May also announced that more of the UK\u2019s aid budget would be spent on humanitarian efforts.</p> <p>A UK official said \u00a31.5bn for the year would be going towards refugees and others in dire need which is an extra 10% uplift from the aid budget. About \u00a32.5m will go to an international fund to help resettle refugees in other countries.</p> <p>However, May unveiled no new commitments for the UK to take in more than the 20,000 vulnerable Syrians who David Cameron agreed to accept by 2020, despite calls from charities and Labour for Britain to do more.</p> <p>Speaking ahead of the summit, May argued it was better to help a greater number of refugees at camps in countries bordering Syria than to resettle a smaller number in the UK. </p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-09-20T21:45:31.822Z\">at 10.45pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57e1a41fe4b05714d0da2cba\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/patrick-kingsley\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-20T21:27:07.903Z\">10.27pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>More from Patrick Kingsley from the leaders\u2019 summit on refugees:</strong></p> <blockquote> <p>The US also admitted that the pledges announced on Tuesday include any policy announced since the start of the year, and said that some of the pledges may not strictly fall within the previously stated goals of the summit. \u201cWe took a very broad interpretation,\u201d Ann Richard, the US\u2019s assistant secretary of state, said in an interview with the Guardian. </p> <p>\u201cIt didn\u2019t have to be a formal UNHCR resettlement programme, it could be other legal pathways for admission \u2013 scholarships, work visas or humanitarian visas.\u201d</p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p>The pledges also include decisions by Turkey and Jordan in January to nominally open their labour markets to Syrians even though many Syrians in both countries are in reality still excluded from legal work.

On Monday, refugee advocates were left disappointed by the announcement of a non-binding declaration that upheld world leaders\u2019 pre-existing responsibilities for refugees, but offered little in terms of direct commitments.</p> <p>But the mood changed on Tuesday, with 18 developed countries announcing plans to increase legal access to refugees, 17 developing countries pledging to increase refugees\u2019 access to education, and 15 claiming that they would take various measures that could help to expand refugees\u2019 access to work.</p> <p>The western countries included those that are well-known for their generosity to refugees, including Germany and Sweden, as well as those, such as Australia, who are often criticised for their treatment of asylum seekers. Argentina and Portugal were among the countries who pledged to start resettlement programmes for the first time. Commenting on the relative success of his initiative, Obama said: \u201cWe\u2019re going to have to be honest: it\u2019s still not enough \u2013 not sufficient for a crisis of this magnitude.\u201d But he added: \u201cI hope this is a beginning.\u201d</p> <p>Leaders from the world\u2019s major refugee-hosting nations hailed the pledges, but warned that they meant little if they were not carried out.

Then they have a base from which to go. They have a welcome, rather than having refugees come in uninvited or illegally or alone.\u201d</p> <p>Australia launched a pilot of the program in 2013 and a similar initiative is being planned in the United Kingdom and New Zealand. Germany and Switzerland have both experimented with the idea while Spain and Japan are among the countries who have expressed interest in the program.</p> <p>Canada will now work with the UN High Commission for Refugees and Soros\u2019 Open Society Foundations to create training modules based on an analysis of the Canadian model as well as provide technical assistance to countries interested in adopting the program, said McCallum. </p> <p>Private sponsorship was launched in Canada after the Vietnam war and has since brought in more than 275,000 refugees, including nearly 9,000 Syrian refugees, in addition to those brought in by government programs. Studies suggest the support of private citizens facilitates the settlement process, with privately-sponsored refugees reporting more success and integration than their government-sponsored counterparts.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57e16d41e4b05714d0da2b89\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-20T17:13:39.006Z\">6.13pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>An interesting spot on Twitter by the New York Times\u2019 UN correspondent <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SominiSengupta\">Somini Sengupta</a>: the Russian foreign ministry tweeted that, held up by US president Obama\u2019s motorcade, <strong>Russian foreign minister Sergey Lavrov got out and walked the rest of the way to the General Assembly</strong>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/mfa_russia/status/778242365962215424\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Manhattan traffic was blocked because of <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BarackObama\">@BarackObama</a> motorcade. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Lavrov?src=hash\">#Lavrov</a> decided not to wait in traffic jam &amp; headed to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/UN\">@UN</a> by walking <a href=\"https://t.co/L4XVBsvU1d\">pic.twitter.com/L4XVBsvU1d</a></p>&mdash; MFA Russia (@mfa_russia) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mfa_russia/status/778242365962215424\">September 20, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57e16a5ae4b05714d0da2b7b\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-20T17:02:11.067Z\">6.02pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Hollande continues:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>No county can say that it is immune to the threat of Islamic terrorism, which has claimed lost individuals within our countries and radicalised them. </p> <p>No wall can stop ... this scourge.

  "<p>The FBI paid more than $1.3m to unlock the San Bernardino shooter\u2019s iPhone 5C, but one computer scientist from Cambridge University has shown that the passcodes can be hacked using a store-bought kit worth less than $100.</p> <p>Sergei Skorobogatov demonstrated a technique known as NAND mirroring \u2013 dismissed by the FBI director, James Comey, as <a href=\"http://www.computerworld.com/article/3048243/apple-ios/fbi-chief-shoots-down-theory-that-nand-mirroring-will-be-used-to-crack-terrorists-iphone.html\">being unworkable</a> \u2013 to break into any model of iPhone up to the iPhone 6, including the iPhone 5C. He outlined the attack in a paper <a href=\"http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.04327\">published last week</a> as well as a YouTube video.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tM66GWrwbsY\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/tM66GWrwbsY?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>The technique focuses on bypassing the limit on password retry attempts. Typically the iPhone will lock users out after six failed attempts to guess the passcode. In eliminating this restriction, anyone trying to break into an iPhone can run through many different combinations of characters until the phone is unlocked.</p> <p>To achieve this, Skorobogatov soldered off the phone\u2019s NAND chip, the main memory storage system used on many Apple devices. The researcher was then able to reverse-engineer the way the memory system communicated with the phone to create a cloned version of the chip with the password attempt counter set to zero.</p> <p>\u201cBecause I can create as many clones as I want, I can repeat the process many, many times until the passcode is found,\u201d he explained in the video. Each run of six attempts takes around 90 seconds, so to go through a full cycle of all 10,000 potential four-digit passcodes would take around 40 hours \u2013 less than two days. Cracking six-digit passcodes would take much longer.</p> <p><strong>The electrical components required for the attack can be bought online from eBay, Amazon or Alibaba for around \u00a375 ($100), Skorobogatov claims in his research paper.</strong></p> <p><strong>\u201cThe process does not require any expensive and sophisticated equipment. All needed parts are low cost and were obtained from local electronics distributors,\u201d Skorobogatov said.</strong></p> <p> A similar technique could also be used for newer models including the iPhone 6S and iPhone 7, although \u201cmore sophisticated hardware will be required\u201d, wrote Skorobogatov.</p> <p>In April, Comey revealed that the FBI had <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/apr/29/fbi-bought-1m-iphone-5c-hack-but-doesnt-know-how-it-works\">paid about $1.3m</a> to a third party for software to hack into the iPhone of San Bernardino gunman Syed Farook. \u201cIt was, in my view, worth it,\u201d he said.</p> <p>At the time Apple had declined to help the bureau break into the phone, arguing it would require weakening the security of all iPhones. This led the US government to issue Apple with a court order to try to force the tech company to give so-called \u201cbackdoor access\u201d into Farook\u2019s phone, something Apple battled with a high-profile legal and PR campaign. </p> <p>The US government subsequently <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/mar/28/apple-fbi-case-dropped-san-bernardino-iphone\">dropped the case</a> after paying an undisclosed, specialist company to break into the phone.</p> <p>Before gaining access to the phone and its contents, the FBI said it had considered many different techniques, including the NAND mirroring approach. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t work,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.onthewire.io/comey-nand-mirroring-doesnt-work/\">said Comey</a> at the time. Skorobogatov had demonstrated that he was wrong.</p> <p>\u201cSkorobogatov was able to do what the FBI said was impossible,\u201d said security and policy researcher Susan Landau in a <a href=\"https://www.lawfareblog.com/securing-phones-and-securing-us-revisited  https://www.lawfareblog.com/securing-phones-and-securing-us-revisited  \">blogpost</a>. </p> <p>\u201cThe moral of the story? The solution is not, as the FBI has been saying, a bill to make it easier to access encrypted communications, as in the proposed revised <a href=\"https://www.justsecurity.org/32818/feinstein-burr-2-0-crypto-backdoor-bill-lives/\">Burr-Feinstein bill</a>. Such \u2018solutions\u2019 would make us less secure, not more so. Instead we need to increase law enforcement\u2019s capabilities to handle encrypted communications and devices.\u201d</p> <p><em>\u2022 This article was amended on 23 September 2016 to clarify details of the kit needed for the hacking technique described.</em></p>",

  "<p>Tottenham Hotspur\u2019s 17-year-old attacking midfield prodigy Marcus Edwards reminds Mauricio Pochettino of a young Lionel Messi and the manager is considering whether to give him a first-team debut at home against Gillingham in the EFL Cup on Wednesday night.</p> <p>Pochettino has named Edwards in his matchday squad and the expectation is he will begin among the substitutes. There has long been a buzz about the diminutive left-footer with the low centre of gravity, whose favourite position is No10 and whose greatest asset is his ability to glide past opponents, and Pochettino only added to it with his comments on Tuesday. \u201cHis qualities \u2026 it\u2019s only looks \u2013 his body and the way that he plays \u2013 remember a little bit from the beginning of Messi,\u201d the manager said.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/20/tottenham-harry-kane-out-eight-weeks-ankle-injury\">Tottenham\u2019s Harry Kane could be out for eight weeks with ankle injury</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Pochettino\u2019s decision to mention the teenager in the same breath as one of the all-time greats went down predictably badly with the club\u2019s press department, which is in the business of discouraging such hyperbole. The concern would be that it needlessly places extra pressure on Edwards\u2019s shoulders.</p> <p>It is important to note that Pochettino was not predicting that Edwards would become the next Messi, merely that he has the same playing style. Then again, Edwards\u2019 nickname at the club is \u201cMini Messi\u201d, and Pochettino would not have said what he said if he did not believe that the youngster has the strength of character to cope.</p> <p>Pochettino detoured, briefly, on to his memories of \u00c9rik Lamela, when the Tottenham winger was a hugely talented youth prospect at River Plate, who \u201ctook the ball, didn\u2019t give a pass and shot straight away\u201d. But he got back onto the subject of Edwards and he made it plain that he saw a big future for him.</p> <p>\u201cHe is a very good prospect and, potentially, he can be a top player but we need to be patient and tell him that he has a lot of talent, enough talent to be a top player, a great player, but now it\u2019s how he builds his future \u2013 that\u2019s very important,\u201d Pochettino said. \u201cIt\u2019s our responsibility to tell him.\u201d</p> <p>Edwards <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/aug/02/marcus-edwards-17-signs-first-professional-contract-tottenham\">signed a two-year professional contract at Tottenham</a> over the summer, after a stand-off that had gripped since last December and he featured for Pochettino\u2019s team in pre-season. He has been at the club since the age of eight and there is the hope that he can become the latest player to break through from the academy.</p> <p>Pochettino will rotate his players against Gillingham, with Tottenham in the throes of a seven-game sequence in the space of 22 days and he is expected to include the 18-year-old centre-half Cameron Carter-Vickers, in the starting lineup for what would be his debut. Pochettino has extremely high hopes for the USA youth international and, as with Edwards, he was not shy about talking them up.</p> <p>\u201cFor me, he can be one of the best centre-backs in England in the future,\u201d Pochettino said. \u201cHe has a strong mentality and all the qualities for playing centre-back. Does he remind me of myself as a player? No, he is better than me. I said one of the best centre-backs in England.\u201d</p> <p>The right ankle-ligament injury that Harry Kane sustained against Sunderland on Sunday was a major topic of discussion and Pochettino\u2019s assistant, Jes\u00fas P\u00e9rez, said that the swelling was still so severe that it was impossible to accurately scan the damage \u2013 which sounded worrying. \u201cThis is why you can\u2019t give a time-frame [for his absence],\u201d P\u00e9rez said, although the early estimate is one of around eight weeks.</p> <p>It was put to P\u00e9rez that injured ligaments never truly healed and as the problem was to Kane\u2019s favoured shooting foot, he was asked whether there were any long-term concerns over the striker. \u201cOf course, it\u2019s like an accident \u2013 never again is the car the same or never again do you know,\u201d Perez said. \u201cBut there are no problems to recover from injuries. The ligament heals good or bad but it heals. The join adjusts from the previous injuries.\u201d</p> <p>Kane\u2019s absence gives the summer signing, Vincent Janssen, the chance of a prolonged run in the starting XI while Pochettino is expected to give opportunities against Gillingham to the academy-developed midfielders Tom Carroll, Josh Onomah and Harry Winks. He said that another academy player, the 19-year-old striker Shayon Harrison, would have made the squad but for a groin injury. Danny Rose is still out with a hamstring problem.</p>",

Leicester\u2019s defenders were left completely bamboozled there. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f3809bd0111763c4fd4e972fe8b2dcee56ae14d2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f3809bd0111763c4fd4e972fe8b2dcee56ae14d2/0_0_3963_1849/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Chelsea\u2019s Cesc Fabregas scores their third goal.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"467\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Chelsea\u2019s Cesc Fabregas scores their third goal ...</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Carl Recine/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f2d6e60bdd018ab351ec4ef92e423f9930d0f1ec\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f2d6e60bdd018ab351ec4ef92e423f9930d0f1ec/0_0_3493_2096/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Chelsea\u2019s Cesc Fabregas celebrates scoring their third goal.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Then celebrates.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Carl Recine/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-09-20T20:56:06.347Z\">at 9.56pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57e19ed3e4b05714d0da2c9e\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-20T20:42:36.244Z\">9.42pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>ET1:</strong> Diego Costa gets the first half of extra time going. </p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57e19df1e4b0603ea33c463d\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-20T20:40:41.041Z\">9.40pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Full-time: Leicester 2-2 Chelsea</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Cesar Azpilicueta\u2019s spectacular effort means the game finishes all square after 90 minutes, so we\u2019ll have extra time which I\u2019m professionally obliged to pretend to be enthused about.

  "<p>I am a Syrian refugee who was forced to leave my country. It was discovered that I had created an underground network to provide medical aid and supplies to the sick and wounded. The regime had ruled that what I was doing was against the law, so I fled. I took whatever I could fit in a rolling suitcase and nothing more. I now live in the greatest country in the world, and have just become a US citizen.<br></p> <p>In the past year, more than <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/29/syrian-refugees-admitted-united-states\">10,000 Syrian refugees</a>, like me, found refuge in the US. However, there are those who are portraying this great humanitarian deed as a bad thing. They are calling for the United States to shut its doors to Syrians, who are fleeing unspeakable horrors of war and acts of daily terror. Those who would turn their backs on these innocent, desperate victims use scare tactics to gain support. </p> <p>The latest one was an ad by the Trump campaign <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/20/donald-trump-jnr-compares-refugees-poisoned-skittles-twitter-reacted\">comparing Syrian refugees</a> to poisonous candy, Skittles, in this case, but it\u2019s not the first time the analogy has been used. Last year, another reference was made to poisonous peanuts. Of course, the aim is to spread fear, with the ultimate goal of shutting our doors to those who need us most.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/16/obama-refugees-increase-proposal-us-capable-resettling\">Ignore the naysayers.

We should be more afraid of losing our honor and virtue, than of helping these refugees, 80% of whom are women and children. Remember <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/01/alan-kurdi-death-one-year-on-compassion-towards-refugees-fades\">Alan Kurdi</a>, who washed up on the shores of Turkey trying to make it to safety? He was a toddler; someone\u2019s beloved child. Not a Skittle.</p> <p>While scare tactics can be effective, the greater good always is served by the facts. Of the more than 750,000 refugees that have been admitted to the US since 9/11, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/02/donald-trump-syria-refugees-us-immigration-security-terrorism\">just three</a> have been arrested in relation to planning terrorist activities. None have been Syrian. </p> <p>According to the latest Cato Institute study, the chance of an American being killed by a refugee is 1 in 3.6 billion. The likelihood of being murdered by a non-terrorist was 1 in 14,275. Should we suspect our neighbors since they are in the \u201cmore likely\u201d group?</p> <p>I should be angry and outraged by the hateful things that are said about Syrians, but since coming to the US, I began educating myself about the immigrants and refugees who have found safety in this great land. I realize that our welcome of the weak and vulnerable has not come without name-calling and labels.</p> <p>One of my learning experiences took me to the Holocaust Museum in Washington, DC, where I discovered the WWII story of the St Louis, the ship carrying German Jews who were permitted to leave Germany and denied entry to, among other countries, the US. It was feared they might be \u201cGerman spies\u201d or \u201ccommunists\u201d. They ultimately had to return to Europe where many of them perished in the Holocaust. </p> <p>The stains on our history don\u2019t end there, unfortunately. Most of the immigrant groups who resettled in the US experienced xenophobia as a result of their ethnicity. And that says nothing about our treatment of African Americans and the Native Americans who inhabited this country before we all arrived. </p> <p>It is critical to remember that in this Great Melting Pot of America \u2013 so called because we are a nation of immigrants \u2013 the chances are that when your family members arrived, they were targeted in the same way that Syrian refugees are today. </p> <p>It may help to be reminded that the Syrians who have lived among you for generations are famous actors, innovators, business leaders, army personnel and veterans. There are thousands of physicians living and working here, saving hundreds of lives every day. They are ordinary hard-working men and women who make important contributions to our economy and our culture.</p> <p>Let us not fear the stranger because of where they came from or what their religion is, but be brave and courageous and honorable to accept the weak to our shores. We are the land of the free and the home of the brave. We stand up to evil. We do not stay silent.</p>",

Mr Finchley is presenting \u2013 not receiving \u2013 a lifetime achievement award, to his long-term double act partner. The audience laugh and applaud warmly, Paul Finchley is \u2013 for now \u2013 a <a href=\"http://www.channel4.com/programmes/national-treasure\" title=\"\"><strong>National Treasure</strong></a> (Channel 4). Although later he says: \u201cThat\u2019s the Stalin thing, isn\u2019t it? No one wants to be the first to stop clapping the old guard.\u201d</p> <p>Finchley is no longer at the cutting edge of British comedy, and it worries him. \u201cAt what point do comics stop being funny and start being sweet?\u201d he wonders. But he has an afternoon quiz show and repeat fees from the old stuff. Taxi drivers still remember him, and demand a catchphrase. It can\u2019t have been too hard for writer Jack Thorne to&#xa0;find inspiration for the character.</p> <p>Home is a suburban mansion with uplit pillars on the outside and, on the inside, the long-suffering Mrs F, whose Christian faith has enabled her to stand by her man through a lifetime of philandering and pornography. This faith is going to get a serious testing, though, because next morning the police come knocking. There has been an allegation of rape made against Paul Finchley. And, when the press get wind of it (not entirely accidentally), another.</p> <p>More and more women from the past come forward, including some who were children at the time of the alleged offences. \u201cThey think I\u2019m Jimmy fucking Savile,\u201d complains Finchley. National Treasure is clearly based on real events; a dark, Yewtree-shaped shadow hangs over it.</p> <p>It\u2019s real to the core \u2013 the events, the police investigation, the fishing, the press, the issues. And the character, extraordinarily \u2013 and bravely \u2013 portrayed by Robbie Coltrane is not simply a monster, to be run out of town by the mob, but a complex character who demands, if not sympathy, then at least some attempt at understanding. Plus a&#xa0;trial, which he\u2019s not had yet \u2013 not in a&#xa0;court of law anyway, though the tabloid press have made up their minds, so the black-cab drivers and the rest of&#xa0;the public won\u2019t be far behind.</p> <p>Julie Walters is brilliant, too, as Marie Finchley, with only the tangible tension in the muscles of her face and the occasional wobble in her voice betraying the profound pain she is experiencing.</p> <p>A special shout-out too to Andrea Riseborough, who plays their troubled grownup daughter. Dee is a mother of two herself, though they\u2019re living with their father, as she is undergoing treatment for addiction. The stand-out scene in this first episode is Paul\u2019s visit to see her. He\u2019s really there to tell her not to say anything to the press, but he attempts some friendly father-daughter chit-chat. Billy and Frances were over for the bank holiday: \u201cI think they only come to us because we give them more chocolate than their dad.\u201d It triggers a memory from Dee\u2019s own childhood, about chocolate being disapproved of. She\u2019s sarcastic, caustic and angry \u2013 employing strategies clearly learned in therapy to prevent the rage from exploding out. Somewhere, deep down, there may be some sort of father-daughter affection; they actually seem quite similar in many ways, their humour for example. But it\u2019s also very clear there are other memories from her childhood, darker than chocolate.</p> <p>Not an easy or a comfortable watch then, but an important one. National Treasure is thoughtful, bold and accomplished, a powerful example of how the issues of a news story can be explored through television drama.</p> <p>Here\u2019s Julie W again, in <a href=\"http://www.itv.com/hub/parking-wars/2a3838\" title=\"\"><strong>Parking Wars</strong></a> (ITV).

  "<p>A class action lawsuit has been filed in the Canadian city of Vancouver over a tax on foreign home ownership, just weeks after the measure was introduced by officials hoping to cool a housing market that ranks among the world\u2019s least affordable.<br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jun/17/canada-housing-prices-vancouver-asia-justin-trudeau\">Canada's housing 'affordability crisis' fueled by overseas money, Trudeau says</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The provincial government of British Columbia <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/02/vancouver-real-estate-foreign-house-buyers-tax\">ushered in the 15% tax some six weeks ago</a> amid growing pressure to curb home prices in Vancouver. Low interest rates and growing demand from foreign investors \u2013 many of them from China \u2013 had helped push the cost of a detached home in Vancouver to C$1.56m in June, a 39% jump from a year earlier.</p> <p>The tax, which echoes measures imposed on foreign buyers in Hong Kong and Singapore, applies to all property purchases in metro Vancouver by those who are not Canadian or permanent residents as well as those by corporations that are not registered in Canada or which are controlled by foreigners.</p> <p>As many as 4,000 real estate deals were thought to be immediately affected by the tax. Those caught by surprise by the tax included Jing Li, a 29-year-old university student from the People\u2019s Republic of China who moved to Canada three years ago and has yet to obtain permanent residency. </p> <p>In July, with help from her parents and friends, she put down a 10% deposit on a C$560,000 townhouse in metro Vancouver. The new tax came into effect soon after, adding C$84,000 to the overall price of the property. Reneging on the deal will cost her a non-refundable deposit of C$56,000. </p> <p>Jing is now the lead plaintiff on the lawsuit, which argues that the tax violates more than 30 international treaties signed by Canada. These treaties, entered into with countries ranging from China to the United States, include provisions to ensure that Canada treats citizens of these countries as equal to its own citizens, said Luciana Brasil, a partner with Branch MacMaster LLP, the law firm that filed the class action suit on behalf of Jing.</p> <p>\u201cWhen I go and buy the same property that Ms Li bought and I don\u2019t have to pay the tax because I happen to have permanent residency or Canadian citizenship, then she\u2019s being treated less favourably,\u201d said Brasil. \u201cIt is discrimination based on commitments that Canada has made not to treat them differently.\u201d</p> <p>The lawsuit, filed on behalf of foreign buyers from more than 30 countries, seeks to overturn the legislation behind the tax as well as force the province to refund foreign buyers for any tax paid to date. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2016/jul/07/vancouver-chinese-city-racism-meets-real-estate-british-columbia\">Race and real estate: how hot Chinese money is making Vancouver unlivable</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In its efforts to address a critical issue, the tax wrongly targets many foreigners who are legally living and working in Canada, said Brasil, penalising many of them as they make their way through the years-long process of obtaining permanent residency. \u201cWe say they used the wrong tool for the job. It\u2019s like trying to use a screwdriver to put a nail in the wall. It just doesn\u2019t work.\u201d </p> <p>A judge will now decide whether the class action suit can proceed, a process that could take up to a year.

  "<p>Everton\u2019s promising start to the season was put into perspective by Championship opponents as Norwich City deservedly progressed to the last 16 of the League Cup, with the Goodison old boy Steven Naismith not only setting his side on the path to victory but being applauded by the home crowd for doing so.</p> <p>Ronald Koeman had promised beforehand to make a few changes but not too many, and in the event made six. On the evidence of a listless performance, that appears to be too many for Everton, who may be second in the Premier League but found the going tough against a Norwich side who made no fewer than 10 changes of their own from their last league outing.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/20/nottingham-forest-arsenal-efl-cup-third-round-match-report\">Lucas P\u00e9rez opens account as much-changed Arsenal ease past Nottingham Forest</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cThe players who came in applied themselves really well,\u201d said Alex Neil, Norwich\u2019s manager, perhaps unintentionally rubbing salt into Everton\u2019s wounds. \u201cMost of those boys haven\u2019t played a lot of football this season but they still produced a great performance.\u201d</p> <p>Koeman, the Everton manager, said: \u201cNorwich were more clinical than us, I must admit that. They only had two shots on goal, and one of those was lucky.\u201d</p> <p>Norwich survived an early penalty appeal when Aaron Lennon\u2019s goalbound shot struck Steven Whittaker on the elbow. The referee quite reasonably felt the defender could not get out of the way and had his back turned in any case, yet it was a let-off for the visitors because Lennon seemed certain to score once Seamus Coleman had squared the ball across goal.</p> <p>Gerard Deufoleu had the next attempt on target as gaps began to appear in the Norwich defence, but having sprinted purposefully into the area the winger took a fraction too long over his shot and allowed John Ruddy to scramble the ball away. A good block by Robbie Brady was required to prevent Tom Cleverley meeting a cross from Enner Valencia on the six-yard line as the home side stepped up their attacking efforts.</p> <p>Making his first start for Everton, Valencia was supposed to be operating at centre\u2011forward, but was sent down the left wing by a perfectly weighted pass from Ramiro Funes Mori, himself playing in an unusual position at left back.</p> <p>For all their attacking intent, however, Everton were somewhat lightweight up front in the absence of the injured Romelu Lukaku. Valencia did not present the same sort of threat to defenders, and Lennon, Deulofeu and Ross Barkley all struggled to impose themselves on the game.</p> <p>Norwich took Everton to penalties here in the same competition last season and seemed content to stay behind the ball while the game remained scoreless. The debutant striker Nelson Oliveira shot wide in the opening minutes but was otherwise quiet, though it was his subtle flick that sent Naismith striding into the area to break the deadlock.</p> <p>Only four minutes remained before the interval and it was the first time Norwich had even looked interested in opening Everton up, but on his return to Goodison Park Naismith stunned his former crowd with an unexpected finish. Whether he intended to chip Maarten Stekelenburg is debatable since he seemed to slip slightly in the act of shooting, but the effect was a delicate waft over a bemused goalkeeper into an otherwise unprotected net.</p> <p>It took the Goodison crowd a second or two to work out what had happened, but once the penny dropped Naismith\u2019s reward was a generous round of applause. \u201cThat sums up this place,\u201d the scorer said. \u201cIt is a great club, with great people. It wasn\u2019t the cleanest of strikes, I took a big divot, but in the end it\u2019s a goal and that\u2019s all that counts.\u201d</p> <p>Everton could not capitalise on a chance to equalise at the start of the second half with Ruddy out of his area after attempting to head clear. The ball fell straight to Barkley, who attempted to volley it into an empty net from 20 yards out and missed by a considerable distance. It was not an easy chance and he would have been praised for his audacity had it gone in, though he could have taken a touch and tried to make sure rather than going for the spectacular. Deulofeu was guilty of the same offence minutes later when Lennon\u2019s persistence presented him with a clear sight of goal, leaning back and managing to miss the target from a position close to that where Naismith had scored.</p> <p>Koeman replaced both his wingers in a double substitution midway through the second half, and immediately Everton looked sharper. Yannick Bolasie\u2019s cross from the right led to a free kick from which Kevin Mirallas brought a fingertip save from Ruddy, then Alex Pritchard blocked a Valencia effort on the line. Yet this flurry of activity proved misleading.</p> <p>Norwich were the next to score, Josh Murphy taking advantage of some statuesque defending to secure victory with a fine individual goal. Cutting in from the right, the winger rode half\u2011hearted challenges from Funes Mori then Cleverley before beating Stekelenburg from just inside the area as Ashley Williams attempted to block. Ruddy was brought into action a few more times before the final whistle but there was no way back for the Premier League side.</p>",

The collection portrays him as surprisingly immature for a man approaching 40. Trump Jr repeatedly refers to people tweeting at him as \u201cmorons\u201d, while he also described himself as \u201c<a href=\"http://gawker.com/the-one-best-tweet-from-donald-trump-jr-1755251923\">a boob guy</a>\u201d and called a follower a \u201cpussy\u201d.</p> <p>This year Trump Sr <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/feb/08/trump-repeats-insult-from-crowd-member-calling-cruz-a-pussy\">referred to Ted Cruz as a pussy</a> during the Republican presidential primary.</p> <p>Trump Jr\u2019s behaviour would not matter if he was just a rogue son tweeting from a basement. But he is a surrogate for his father\u2019s presidential campaign who even <a href=\"http://www.bustle.com/articles/173659-transcript-of-donald-trump-jrs-rnc-speech-focuses-on-his-fathers-strengths-why-hes-better\">spoke at the Republican national convention</a> in August, and was also involved in the vice-presidential selection process. Trump Jr even met with the National Rifle Association ahead of them endorsing his father, <a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/donald-trump-jrs-skittles-tweet-highlights-key-campaign/story?id=42218871\">according to ABC News</a>.</p> <p>The Trump campaign did not respond to questions about Trump Jr\u2019s continued role in his father\u2019s campaign.

Both have, at times, struggled to distance themselves from white supremacists. Both have displayed misguided views on alleged foreign rapists.</p> <p>Trump Jr was even born into extravagant wealth before being offered a well-paid position in his father\u2019s company \u2013 just like Trump Sr.</p> <p>Oh, and there is one more similarity: Trump Jr <a href=\"http://nypost.com/2016/07/24/donald-trump-jr-wont-rule-out-running-for-mayor-of-nyc/\">has suggested</a> he might run for mayor of New York City in 2017.</p>",
  "<p>Second-half goals by the Manchester City striker Nikita Parris and the Chelsea winger Karen Carney gave England a victory over Belgium in Leuven that enabled them to end their Euro&#xa0;2017 qualifying campaign five points clear at the top of their group and with an unbeaten record.</p> <p>\u201cIt was a very good win against a solid, well-organised team that made it difficult for us at times with their aggressive defending and their direct play when they pushed forward,\u201d the head coach, Mark Sampson, said. \u201cWe struggled at times to keep possession of the ball up front in the first half, but we found the right balance in the second half and in the end I thought it was a comfortable victory.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/aug/03/the-20-greatest-female-football-players-soccer\">The 20 greatest female football players of all time</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cI was delighted with the quality of our goals and with another clean sheet \u2013 that\u2019s 32 goals scored in our eight group matches and only one conceded.\u201d</p> <p>Belgium were the only one of England\u2019s group opponents to have avoided defeat against Sampson\u2019s team and also the only side to have scored against them, a dreadful mistake by the goalkeeper Karen Bardsley having cost the goal <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/apr/08/england-belgium-womens-european-championship-qualifier-match-report\" title=\"\">in a 1-1 draw at Rotherham in April</a>.</p> <p>A couple of early catches from lofted crosses calmed any nerves Bardsley may have been feeling, while at the other end Justien Odeurs had to make a sixth-minute save from the midfielder Jill Scott\u2019s 12-yard shot and then could only watch as a Lucy Bronze drive flew just past the far post.</p> <p>As the Belgians came more into the game, however, Bronze was next in goalmouth action to break up a dangerous attack on the half-hour.</p> <p>England were ineffective in attack for the remainder of the first half but should have taken the lead three minutes after the interval when Bronze set Scott free in the area only for the Manchester City player to shoot wastefully wide.</p> <p>Three minutes later a chance fell to Carney from a Parris cross, but the winger\u2019s 15-yard half-volley was well saved by Odeurs. As Belgium retaliated Bardsley had to tip an Elke van Gorp header over the bar; but the deadlock was broken when Parris headed home a Carney cross in the 65th minute. From that point England controlled the game comfortably and wrapped up victory five minutes from time, Carney working her way past three defenders before shooting home from just inside the penalty area.</p> <p>This was England\u2019s last competitive game before the Euro finals, which are to be played in the Netherlands during July and August next year, but a programme of friendlies against tough opponents \u2013 mostly European \u2013 is being put together by the Football Association.</p> <p>The first of them is a meeting with France at Doncaster next month. England have not beaten the French in 16 games spread over 42 years and Sampson said: \u201cFrance are clearly one of the best teams in world, and they will be a really good test for us. These are the sort of teams we want to be playing in the buildup to the finals and we will be aiming to make the most of all the international windows between now and next July.\u201d</p> <p>A team who England might come up against in the Netherlands is Scotland, who beat Iceland 2-1 on Tuesday to finish joint top of their group and qualify for the first time for a major tournament. Sampson said: \u201cI\u2019m delighted for Anna [Signeul, Scotland\u2019s coach]. It will be good to see them at a big tournament, a tournament that I think will be terrific and very difficult with some excellent teams involved.\u201d</p>",

The one thing I\u2019ve learned in more than 20 years around politics is that convincing people they are wrong is a zero-sum game,\u201d Lewis says.</p> <p>He says the challenge is to work with people to understand what is driving their views, and \u201cwork with them from the source to win their trust.\u201d</p> <p>In his speech to be delivered at the ANU on Wednesday, Soutphommasane acknowledges the broader context of Hanson\u2019s resurgence.</p> <p>He poses two significant questions: he asks should Australians simply accept that a significant section of the community may be holding intolerant views? And should the response be \u201ckilling any racial ugliness with kindness, empathy and understanding\u201d?</p> <p>Soutphommasane rejects the idea that intolerance is ubiquitous, pointing out that 95% of Australian voters did not vote for One Nation in 2016. He says evidence suggests the vast majority of Australians are comfortable with multiculturalism.</p> <p>But he says the nation must avoid the complacency of believing that there may be nothing more Australian than intolerance \u2013 \u201cto believe that copping racism is just part of some initiation rite for any immigrant group.\u201d</p> <p>On the empathy question, the race discrimination commissioner says it should be extended only so far. \u201cIt\u2019s one thing to discuss matters, including on race and religion, in a civil and respectful manner. Dialogue is always welcome. No reasonable person would disagree.</p> <p>\u201cWhere a reasonable person might disagree is where the demand goes further \u2013 where we should call on those vulnerable to discrimination to suck it up and be nice to those dishing them out,\u201d he says.</p> <p>\u201cThat demand doesn\u2019t make sense when such kindness and generosity may not be reciprocated. Too often, people can forget that the burden of racial tolerance isn\u2019t something that weighs upon everyone evenly.\u201d</p> <p>Soutphommasane will say several ethnic and religious communities have expressed fears about a surge in prejudice and intolerance since the resolution of the federal election.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/16/if-you-want-a-response-from-the-muslim-community-first-understand-it\">If you want a response from the Muslim community, first understand it | Mostafa Rachwani</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cI understand their fears.

It can affect what children experience in the schoolyard, and what their parents experience in their workplace.\u201d</p> <p>He says politicians need to set a higher standard with their public interventions.</p> <p>\u201cOur society is diminished by inflammatory rhetoric or appeals to xenophobia. We expect our political representatives to set the tone for our society, not to be targeting particular groups with hostility.</p> <p>\u201cWe should be forthright in speaking out against political appeals to fear.

  "<p>The European commission will launch a further crackdown on tax avoidance by reviving a long-stalled plan to overhaul how companies report their profits, according to Europe\u2019s most senior tax policy official.</p> <p>Under the plans, companies would have to calculate their profits under common European rules rather than national ones, closing down options for creative cross-border accountancy. The draft law, known as the common consolidated corporate tax base, will be published in late October or early November.<br></p> <p>The idea has failed in the past, partly because of opposition from the UK and Ireland. But Pierre Moscovici, the European commissioner for economic and financial affairs, said that public outrage about companies paying very low rates of tax was helping the idea gain traction.<br></p> <p>\u201cWe have a strong asset that was not present five years ago \u2013 it is the mood in the public and the scandals, which give us some strength.

It\u2019s the rise, a hiccup and probably another rise to come. They are shifting to slightly longer two or three-month loans, which are still extortionately priced. The fact they have been able to pay these fines shows they are not just scraping by. There is still a lot of money going through their books.\u201d </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3cce6428fe257aecd8a27075a661a7d268dbc468\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3cce6428fe257aecd8a27075a661a7d268dbc468/0_32_3499_2099/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Neil Hall/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The <a href=\"https://www.fca.org.uk/news/press-releases/fca-confirms-price-cap-rules-payday-lenders\">rate cap</a> limits interest to 0.8% a day and no one can repay more than 100% of what they initially borrowed. But even under the new rules, the annualised rate of interest that Wonga charges on a \u00a3100 loan is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/dec/16/wonga-cuts-cost-borrowing-interest-rate\">1,509%</a> \u2013 although that\u2019s down from its 5,853% peak.</p> <p>The Money Shop, whose chain of high street outlets has more then halved from its once 500-strong network to just 230, charges an annualised rate of 709% on a \u00a3250 loan repaid over four months. It said it is modernising its stores and expanding some of them. </p> <p>But what has happened to the desperate borrowers once hooked on short-term loans? There is little evidence, yet, that legal doorstep lenders such as Provident Financial have picked up much of the business, or that illegal loan sharks have flourished. </p> <p>Some people have simply stopped borrowing, said Packman, but others have gone into deeper arrears on rent and utility bills. He points to a steep rise in bailiff orders by councils in recent years. </p> <p>Sara Williams, a Citizens Advice adviser, says other forms of high cost credit such as \u201clogbook loans\u201d (money secured against the borrower\u2019s car), guarantor loans and doorstep lending can be just as problematic for the borrower. \u201cThe worst excesses of the payday loan industry have gone\u201d, she said, \u201cbut checks on a borrower\u2019s ability to repay are in some cases still inadequate as recent Citizens Advice research shows.\u201d Her blog site, <a href=\"http://debtcamel.co.uk/payday-loan-refunds/\">Debt Camel</a>, helps victims of payday lending obtain refunds, without having to go through a claims management firm. Some people who have borrowed every month for years have recovered thousands in interest paid.</p> <p>The trail of misery left by the payday lending boom is showing up in complaints to the financial ombudsman. Earlier this month it said that WDFC, the parent group of Wonga, was the subject of 821 complaints, up from 361 in the same period of 2015, while Instant Cash Loans received 285 complaints.</p> <p>The industry insists it has reformed. Russell Hamblin-Boone, of the Consumer Finance Association, which represents around 75% of payday lending firms (although not Wonga), said: \u201cThe payday market is unrecognisable today from a few years ago. There are no rollovers, no cold-calling, no aggressive collection tactics and stringent customer affordability checks. Short-term lending now stands as a viable alternative to the mainstream credit market.\u201d</p> <h2>Payday loans - a timeline</h2> <p><strong>2006</strong> Payday loans first made their presence felt in the UK. They were developed and marketed as one-off loans for unexpected expenses or luxury items but in reality were mainly used to fund everyday expenses such as groceries, bills and the costs associated with owning a car, according to the charity Citizens Advice. In 2006 a total of \u00a3330m was lent to individuals \u2013 but over the next few years the industry enjoyed explosive growth.</p> <p><strong>2007</strong> Wonga launched in the UK and within a few years had become the sector\u2019s best-known name, helped by a blizzard of advertising, including several football-club shirt deals.</p> <p><strong>2009</strong> The total amount lent in the UK by payday lenders reached \u00a31.2bn.</p> <p><strong>2010-11</strong> Anger starts to build against \u201clegal loan sharks\u201d with Stella Creasy, a Labour MP, leading the charge. \u201cCompanies like Wonga are taking advantage of a perfect storm in consumer credit, where more and more people are struggling as the cost of living soars and mainstream banks withdraw from the market,\u201d she said.</p> <p><strong>2012-13</strong> The industry\u2019s peak years, when 10m to 12m payday loans a year were being taken out. In 2012 the amount lent hit \u00a33.7bn \u2013 more than 10 times the figure in 2006 \u2013 and in 2013 it stood at \u00a32.5bn. In June 2013 Wonga raised the standard interest rate quoted on its website from 4,214% to 5,853% APR. The following month it emerged that the archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, had told Wonga that the Church of England wanted to \u201ccompete\u201d it out of existence as part of its plans to expand credit unions. But in September 2013 Wonga revealed that during 2012 it handed out nearly four million loans worth a total of \u00a31.2bn to one million customers.</p> <p><strong>2014</strong> An annus horribilis for Wonga and the industry. In May the City regulator laid into some companies\u2019 misleading adverts and in June Wonga was ordered to pay more than \u00a32.6m compensation after it was found to have sent threatening letters to customers from fake law firms. The following month the company axed the controversial cuddly puppets used in its TV adverts. Also in July the City regulator proposed a shake-up of the industry, The Money Shop agreed to hand back more than \u00a3700,000 to customers after it admitted breaking its own rules and Cash Genie said it may have to compensate customers after uncovering a string of problems. In October Wonga was forced to write off \u00a3220m of loans to 375,000 borrowers.</p> <p><strong>2015</strong> In January price caps on payday lenders took effect. Interest and fees on all high-cost short-term credit loans were capped at a daily rate of 0.8% of the amount borrowed. If loans are not paid on time, default charges must not exceed \u00a315. In addition the total cost including fees and interest is capped at 100% of the original sum. The caps mean someone borrowing \u00a3100 for 30 days and paying it back on time will pay no more than \u00a324 in fees and charges. In May Wonga relaunched itself with new TV adverts aimed at a more middle-class audience. In October Dollar Financial UK, with brands including The Money Shop, was ordered by regulators to refund \u00a315.4m to 147,000 customers. And in November it emerged that QuickQuid and Pounds to Pocket were to write off more than 2,500 loans to customers and refund almost 1,500 people following regulatory action.</p> <p><strong>2016</strong> In January it emerged that Cash Genie had gone into liquidation. In May Wonga said it saw its losses more than double in 2015: it reported a pre-tax loss of \u00a380.2m for the year. In July Google started banning some payday loan adverts and said that in the US it was outlawing ads for loans with an APR of 36% or higher. This week payday firm CFO Lending said it had agreed to pay more than \u00a334m in redress to more than 97,000 customers for unfair practices.</p>",
  "<p>It was a mistake \u2013 a monumental, world-class mistake. Cars for everyone was one of the most stupid promises politicians ever made. Cars are meant to meet a simple need: quick and efficient mobility. Observe an urban artery during the school run, or a trunk road on a bank holiday weekend, and ask yourself whether the current system meets that need. The vast expanse of road space, the massive investment in metal and fossil fuel, has delivered the freedom to sit fuming in a toxic cloud as your life ticks by.</p> <p>The primary aim has become snarled up with other, implicit objectives: the sense of autonomy, the desire for self-expression through the configuration of metal and plastic you drive, and the demand for profit by car manufacturers and fossil fuel producers whose lobbying keeps us on the road rather than moving along it.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/23/how-to-reduce-the-risks-of-carmageddon\">How to reduce the risks of carmageddon | Letters</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Step back from this mess and ask yourself this. If you controlled the billions that are spent every year \u2013 privately and publicly \u2013 on the transport system, and your aim was to smooth the passage of those who use it, is this what you would do? Only if your imagination had been surgically excised.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/jul/04/three-quarters-of-people-living-in-cities-want-clean-air-zones-poll-finds\">Three-quarters of people living in cities want clean air zones, poll finds</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Even in a small, economically mature, densely populated nation like the UK, where change is easy, we\u2019re still driving in the wrong direction. The government boasts that car use is rising again, after being knocked back by the recession. It is spending \u00a39bn of our scarce money on roads every year, <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/514912/road-use-statistics.pdf\">70% of which is on new capacity</a>. Thanks to the cuts, bus services supported by local authorities <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/485296/annual-bus-statistics-year-ending-march-2015.pdf\">reduced their mileage by 10% last year</a>.</p> <p>Over half the car journeys people make in this country are less than five miles: this is what policy failure looks like. Why don\u2019t people cycle instead? Perhaps because, though the number of motorists killed or seriously injured has fallen sharply, the number of cyclists killed or hurt on the roads has climbed since 2003. This now accounts for <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/514912/road-use-statistics.pdf\">14% of all casualties</a>, though cycling amounts to <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/statistical-data-sets/nts03-modal-comparisons\">only 1% of the distance we travel</a>.</p> <p>The simplest, cheapest and healthiest solution to congestion is blocked by the failure to provide safe transit. Last year the transport department crowed that it could cut \u00a323m from its budget as a result of an \u201c<a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-33013567\">underspend on the Cycle Cities Ambition budget</a>\u201d. Instead of handing this money back to the Treasury, it should have discovered why it wasn\u2019t spent, and ensured that it doesn\u2019t happen again.</p> <p>The undercapacity of the roads arises from the overcapacity of the vehicles that use them. Average occupancy of cars in the UK is 1.6; and it seems to me that the bigger the car, the fewer people it tends to contain. With a few exceptions (such as Mayor Sadiq Khan\u2019s plans for London), almost nothing is done to change or challenge this.</p> <p>When a major feeder road was resurfaced in my home city, I heard people complaining that it took them an hour and a half to travel two miles to work. They could have walked in half the time, or cycled in one-tenth. The council had a perfect opportunity to intervene, with notices beside the road urging people to switch to two wheels or two feet. But it sat and watched, as trapped in its mindset as people were in their cars.</p> <p>Our problems are dwarfed by what is happening elsewhere. Global car production has almost doubled in 10 years. The number of cars on the planet is expected to rise from 1.2bn to 2bn by 2035. Carmageddon beckons: a disaster for the climate, public health and our quality of life. Yet it is still treated as an indicator of economic success.</p> <p>We are told that this is about choice. But surely there should be a hierarchy of choice: the choice of whether or not to suffer a premature death should take precedence over our choice of transport mode.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/sep/05/toxic-air-pollution-particles-found-in-human-brains-links-alzheimers\">Our brains are filled with metal particles</a>, our children\u2019s lungs and mental development are stunted, and an epidemic of heart and lung disease is catalysed \u2013 all to grant people the choice of stewing in a traffic jam rather than getting there by other means.</p> <p>In <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/jul/04/three-quarters-of-people-living-in-cities-want-clean-air-zones-poll-finds\">a recent YouGov poll in Britain</a>, 76% of respondents opted for clean air zones in their cities, enforced by taxes and charges. Sorry, wrong kind of choice.</p> <p>So here\u2019s a novel idea: how about a 21st-century transport system for the 21st century? <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2014/jul/10/helsinki-shared-public-transport-plan-car-ownership-pointless\">Helsinki is making public transport as convenient</a> and flexible as private transport. For example, by aggregating people\u2019s requests via a smartphone app, minibus services can collect people from their homes and deliver them close to their destinations while minimising their routes. <a href=\"http://inhabitat.com/hamburg-announces-plans-to-become-a-car-free-city-within-20-years/\">Hamburg is building a network</a> of cycling and walking paths so safe, pleasant and convenient that no one with the ability to do otherwise would want to take a car.</p> <p>Let\u2019s set a date by which no new car is manufactured unless it\u2019s electric. Let\u2019s set up household charging points, allowing people to plug in without having to take their car off the road. Let\u2019s introduce a scrappage payment, not to replace old cars with new ones but to replace old cars with no car at all. It would take the form of public transport tokens.</p> <p>How about facilitating \u201cwalking buses\u201d to school, with parents taking turns to lead a crocodile of children? How about local drop-off points, so that parcel companies don\u2019t clog our streets and we never miss deliveries? How about providing bikes for hire at stations, and \u2013 yes, I believe in miracles \u2013 synchronising bus and train timetables?</p> <p>Let\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.bettertransport.org.uk/sites/default/files/research-files/reopening-railways-report.pdf\">reopen old rail lines</a> closed in the mistaken belief that train travel was on the way out (it has grown 74% since 1995) and build new lines to bridge the gaps. Let\u2019s bring train services under public control and use the money now spent on road-building to make tickets affordable for everyone.</p> <p>Let\u2019s implement the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2006/dec/05/comment.politics\">brilliant plan proposed by Dr Alan Storkey</a> for an intercity bus network faster and more convenient than car travel, using dedicated lanes on the motorways and interchanges at the motorway junctions. Let\u2019s build new settlements around public transport hubs \u2013 light rail, tram and electric bus systems \u2013 rather than around the car.</p> <p>What is difficult about any of this? What technological barriers stand in the way? None. Transport is among the simplest of our problems to solve. Yet our governments are stuck in a 20th-century gridlock, still committed to their great mistake.</p>",
  "<p>Re Zoe Williams\u2019 article (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/18/jeremy-corbyn-labour-make-up-or-break-up\" title=\"\">After Corbyn wins, Labour has to make up or break up</a>, 19 September), the most important thing about Jeremy Corbyn is what he symbolises to the thousands of people who have joined the Labour party since he became leader. After years of soulless Blairite pragmatism without principles, Corbyn represents a return to conviction and hope for radical change. The numbers inspired by Corbyn are not enough by a long shot to win an election. Nonetheless, it\u2019s a huge number of people, and their energy and conviction could be a crucial part of a broader election-winning strategy.</p> <p>But this should not blind us to the fact that Corbyn has proved extremely bad at the practical skills of leadership. After many years of being a backbench rebel, he has not taken well to the business of putting out press statements, formulating catchy messages that are repeated to death, putting together a simple narrative that gives people a sense of Labour\u2019s positive vision. In the real world these are things you need to do if you want to cut through to the vast proportion of the electorate who don\u2019t follow lefty politics on social media, and who get their politics by catching the odd line on the television or radio news.</p> <p>The energy and enthusiasm that Corbyn has brought about is crucial. But I hope that it becomes tempered with a little more calm pragmatism, and that the thousands who have been attending rallies start knocking on doors.<br><strong>Philip Goff (</strong><a href=\"https://twitter.com/Philip_Goff\" title=\"\"><strong>@Philip_Goff</strong></a><strong>)</strong><br><em>Associate professor of philosophy, Central&#xa0;European University</em></p> <p>\u2022 Zoe Williams says Owen Smith is \u201cexactly like Corbyn on all matters of policy\u201d. Really? What about Trident? Corbyn\u2019s unilateralism is not only a sure-fire vote loser, it marks out Smith as a \u201cserious\u201d politician for his pro-deterrence stance. And what about Brexit? Corbyn\u2019s rush to invoke article 50 betrayed his enthusiasm for quitting the EU. By contrast, Smith\u2019s position could prove hugely appealing to a large section of remainers. And were a snap election to be called, given that a political party needs far fewer votes to get elected than to win a referendum, Labour under Smith could do well. Well enough, that is, at least to avert the inevitable electoral disaster that Corbyn\u2019s leadership would bring. Which could mean the difference between 10 years of Tory misrule and a generation of it.<br><strong>Simon Platman</strong><br><em>London</em></p> <p>\u2022 I fully concur with Lisa Nandy regarding the need for the Labour party and other progressive parties to bury the hatchet (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/18/labours-lisa-nandy-urges-party-to-ditch-tribalism\" title=\"\">Nandy: party must end tribal divisions to survive</a>,19 September). If&#xa0;we\u2019re ever to rid our country of Tory governments, we have to learn to collaborate.

Having been out of it for over 10 years \u2013 after a 25-year membership, 12 of them as a Labour councillor \u2013 I see an arrogance and an attitude of \u201cmight is right\u201d that I couldn\u2019t see when I was in the party.

None, I think, can pretend that they have not criticised the leader. At a time when the party has suspended and/or denied a leadership election vote to hundreds of members on flimsy and often unexplained grounds, MPs seem to expect to be allowed much greater latitude. Many, well beyond the confines of the list, frequently declare that the party they represent \u201ccannot win\u201d the next general election. It\u2019s difficult to imagine a more damaging or indeed subversive claim. No Tory MP would dream of saying such a thing.

He may not know that there has been work on computer redistricting since at least the 1960s, so it is not so 21st-century. One reason why it has not been widely adopted in practice is that it doesn\u2019t actually make the problem go away.</p> <p>The desirable aspects of a set of constituencies are near population equality, compactness (not long and thin, or bendy) and contiguity (you can get between any two points of a constituency without leaving it). These attributes are in principle computable, and remove some of the obvious ways in which constituencies could be gerrymandered.</p> <p>But other factors are also important. There can be little sense of a shared community between constituents separated by mountains or wide rivers, or living in different boroughs or counties, so how can they sensibly share the same representative? Leaving existing boundaries unchanged where possible is also desirable (to avoid wholesale identity shifts at every review). The problem of complexity is intractable \u2013 an <a href=\"http://www.citylab.com/politics/2013/02/why-computers-alone-cant-eliminate-corruption-redistricting/4790/\">influential paper in 2010</a> found that it is \u201cprobably impossible to create a computer program that solves these problems optimally and reliably except in very small or limited cases\u201d.</p> <p>The notorious \u201c<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/13/cornish-come-out-fighting-over-proposed-cross-border-constituency-with-devon\">Devonwall</a>\u201d constituency is an example of the sort of undesirable outcome that can result when apparently reasonable rules are applied without wisdom. It actually results from a quite foolish tightening of the population inequality tolerance to 5% in the legislation enacted in 2011. A House of Commons briefing paper found that far less disruption would be caused by an 8% tolerance about the average, but was ignored.</p> <p>One is almost tempted to think that the coalition government wanted to cause as much disruption as possible.<br><strong>Professor Jonathan Rosenhead</strong><br><em>London</em></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/23/pr-not-to-blame-for-the-rise-of-hitler\">PR not to blame for the rise of Hitler | Letters</a> </p> </aside>  <p><em><br></em></p> <p>\u2022 To those who believe proportional representation is the way forward, I would like to remind you of Germany\u2019s Weimar constitution and of the weaknesses of PR, which created an unstable government that was then exploited.

Now it is unlikely that Somerset will add to their three batting points, which may be significant when everything is totted up on Friday.</p> <p>For Nottinghamshire <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/may/13/jake-ball-england-test-chocolate-tart-sri-lanka-cricket\">Jake Ball, easily the outstanding bowler</a> in an attack that, like Somerset\u2019s, contained three spinners, took six for 47 including three wickets in that deadly period. At the start he had dismissed the openers, Marcus Trescothick and Tom Abell, in a most impressive spell with the first new ball.</p> <p>At the other end Imran Tahir, who had bowled poorly in his earlier spells, was suddenly donated two wickets by Lewis Gregory (swishing and missing) and Roelof van der Merwe (blocking and missing). It was an astonishing collapse but it could not be attributed to the vagaries of the much-discussed pitch at Taunton, which offered some spin but little venom.</p> <p>Both captains may have spent part of a bewildering day wondering whether they possessed the correct attack for the conditions. But for two innings of heroic proportions, Somerset\u2019s Championship dreams would already be over. At the helm, perhaps for the last time, was Rogers, aged 39, who first visited these parts as a teenager when he played for North Devon CC at Instow, the home of the beloved umpire David Shepherd. He hit one of his stealthy hundreds, the 75th of his career, just what Somerset needed with so much at stake.</p> <p>At the other end was Hildreth, who has reached stalwart status here \u2013 he made his Somerset debut 13 years ago. He hobbled to his 39th hundred gallantly. A yorker from Ball thudded into Hildreth\u2019s right ankle when he had scored seven and he could barely move thereafter.</p> <p>The problem was that Hildreth could barely put any weight on his right foot. Having hopped a single or two, Abell came out as a runner \u2013 fortunately Trescothick was successfully dissuaded from taking on that role \u2013 as Hildreth gritted his teeth and watched the ball. Once he tried to hook a bouncer from Brett Hutton and the sudden pressure put on his right foot found him in obvious agony.</p> <p>But for most of the time Hildreth made a virtue of his impediment. He kept his head still while his right foot stayed static of its own accord and he played everything on its merits. Often Hildreth indulges in a galaxy of sweeps, reverse and orthodox against the spinner and he is usually good at that. But here he played gun-barrel straight; those sweeps were out of the question. Then, having started to relish the luxury of a runner, he suddenly accelerated, timing the ball exquisitely with those trademark square drives that made his runner redundant.</p> <p>Both Hildreth and Rogers succumbed to the second new ball, giving catches behind the wicket. The easy conclusion \u2013 that they had done enough to ensure Somerset\u2019s dominance in this game \u2013 was then swept away with a batting display down the order that was not the stuff of champions.</p>",
  "<p>Brian Tyree Henry has a question. \u201cHave you heard of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/feb/14/canadian-companys-genetically-modified-apples-win-us-approval\">the Arctic Apple</a>?\u201d he asks in the restaurant of the Ace Hotel in midtown Manhattan. Before I can confess that I\u2019ve never heard of it or start Googling, there\u2019s an explanation. \u201cIf you bite it, it doesn\u2019t go brown, it stays white. It never oxidises. I was like, this is next to <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/79566/soylent-green\">Soylent Green</a>; I bet you we\u2019re going to start eating people. So yeah, welcome to the future.\u201d </p> <p>It\u2019s a challenge to keep up with Henry. Fans of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/sep/06/better-things-atlanta-fx-comedy-donald-glover-pamela-adlon\">Atlanta</a> \u2013 Donald Glover\u2019s auteur drama on FX, <a href=\"http://www.vulture.com/2016/09/fx-atlanta-premiere-ratings-strong.html\">which drew three million viewers with its season premiere</a> \u2013 will recognise him as Alfred Miles aka Paper Boi, the laconic would-be rapper around whom much of the action revolves. But there\u2019s nothing laconic about Henry, who seems determined to put the world to rights \u2013 one genetically modified piece of fruit at a time.</p> <p>\u201cYou can put Trump in the White House, but you need to prepare for a revolt because I\u2019m going nuts,\u201d says Henry, as he waits for his English breakfast \u2013 a deconstructed version including black pudding \u2013 to arrive. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2008/sep/08/escapefromnewyork.kurtrussell\"> Escape From New York</a> in here and you might as well call me Kurt Russell because I\u2019m going to be fucking people up. It\u2019s going to be Mad Max.\u201d</p> <p>From the coldly seething anger to the apocalyptic references, Henry\u2019s takedown of the Republican presidential candidate and his possibly cataclysmic consequences could come straight from the script of Atlanta. It has been the most popular of FX\u2019s offerings this autumn and one of the most critically lauded of the TV fall debutants. It\u2019s been called genre defying, earned comparisons to fellow FX show Louie and The Wire, and was dubbed \u201c<a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/09/19/the-slo-mo-specificity-of-atlanta\">shrewd, emotional, and impolite</a>\u201d by the New Yorker\u2019s Emily Nussbaum.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>It\u2019s also black. Brazenly so \u2013 from its cast and crew to its subject matter, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/feb/25/the-new-south-atlanta-georgia-city-of-black-power\">to the city in which it\u2019s set</a>. Atlanta has managed to stand out during a season that\u2019s been heralded for embracing diversity. But where other shows such as Luke Cage, Pitch or Queen Sugar may exist in alternate universes or times, Atlanta is set in the here and now, in contemporary America. And that setting, slap bang in the middle of the most divisive election race in recent history, feels apt.</p> <p>\u201cWe should be over this by now but we\u2019re not,\u201d says Henry of race relations in the US. \u201cWhich is why I\u2019m glad we\u2019re doing our show because we\u2019re going to be telling you exactly how we feel and exactly where we\u2019re coming from, and exactly how it feels to be a black American in this country right now.\u201d</p> <p>Variations on that line have been used by a lot of the cast while promoting the show \u2013 Donald Glover said he \u201cwanted to show white people, you don\u2019t know everything about black culture\u201d. During the show\u2019s first episode, which focuses around a shooting in a car park, the standout moment is when a white friend casually throws around the N-word. It\u2019s a scene which finishes on Glover and Henry staring down the camera at their acquaintance, and it feels like they\u2019re also looking at the viewer and America at large. It\u2019s as if those scenes are supposed to elicit a knowing nod from African Americans and a wince from white America.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"cac0cba26db1ea7df483e93ca404fe679dab3ef4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cac0cba26db1ea7df483e93ca404fe679dab3ef4/199_126_2603_1563/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jumping the couch: Keith Standfield as Darius, Donald Glover as Earnest Marks and Brian Tyree Henry as Alfred Miles.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jumping the couch: Keith Standfield as Darius, Donald Glover as Earnest Marks and Brian Tyree Henry as Alfred Miles.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: FX</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cNo one seems give a shit about what they say about any race in this country,\u201d says Henry. \u201cWhich is funny because the last time I checked isn\u2019t this the land of immigration? Isn\u2019t this where you\u2019re supposed to come and be what you want to be? It\u2019s like, yeah, but only if we say so, though.\u201d</p> <p>His words are shrewd, emotional and a little impolite, at least by conservative America\u2019s standards, but his tell-it-how-you-see-it approach began early. Henry was the youngest in a house with four older sisters in Washington DC. Acting was a survival mechanism as much as a hobby. \u201cMy sisters were teenagers when I was born so the last thing they wanted was a little nappy-headed boy running around,\u201d he recalls. \u201cI would imitate them or copy things off TV. I would leave the house and be these people.\u201d </p> <p>That early play turned into something more when Henry started acting at Morehouse College, the most famous of the historically black colleges and the same place <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/jun/30/amuel--ackson--was-a-drug-addict-out-of-my-mind-but-showed-up-on-time-and-hit-my-marks\">Samuel L Jackson caught the acting bug</a>. The first play he auditioned for was August Wilson\u2019s classic tale of newly freed slaves, <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2010/jun/04/jow-turners-come-and-gone-review\">Joe Turner\u2019s Come and Gone</a> and he landed the lead role of <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/theatreblog/2010/jun/15/august-wilson-joe-turners-come-gone\">Herald Loomis</a>. Henry still calls theater his first love and after Morehouse he moved to Yale to take part in the acting programme.

He made the transfer from stage to screen with bit parts in The Good Wife, The Knick and Boardwalk Empire, alongside <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/jan/13/michael-k-williams-interview-omar-the-wire-the-gambler\">Michael K Williams</a>. He\u2019s in HBO\u2019s Vice Principals, but Atlanta is where Henry looks most at home, which isn\u2019t surprising considering it\u2019s where (at Morehouse) he matured. </p> <p>But the city itself is important to Henry for another reason: \u201cWe went there, we created it, we made it a metropolitan,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s the place where a lot of black history happened: Martin Luther King was there, Jim Crow was there, even the Olympics were there.</p> <p>\u201cAtlanta has become and has always been a place where you create your own universe. That\u2019s what our show is trying to do; create our own universe with these two young men trying to make it in this universe which is still part of this bigger picture. It\u2019s still part of America, it\u2019s still part of Georgia, it\u2019s still part of the south, but it\u2019s created it\u2019s own entity and I love that.\u201d</p> <p>Talking to Henry, that idea of identity and defining yourself comes up frequently. Whether it\u2019s talking about his favourite book as a kid, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/antoine-de-saint-exupery\">Antoine de Saint-Exup\u00e9ry</a>\u2019s The Little Prince (\u201c[it\u2019s about] opening your mind and not letting people limit you\u201d), his dress sense (\u201cI love wearing a fitted hat because as soon as I put it on people go \u2018oh wait, he went to Yale?\u2019\u201d) or his love of rap (\u201cIt\u2019s the place I feel like black artists have the most room to be who they want to be\u201d), it\u2019s there in the background.</p> <p>Questioning, teasing and often provoking, there\u2019s an obvious link between the world Henry and Glover have created and the real one they inhabit. So what about the world of Atlanta hip-hop? It\u2019s often presented as an out of control, drug-laced trap house where debauchery is next to godliness. For Henry it\u2019s much more complicated than that.</p> <p>\u201cIn hip-hop you can be anything. What you look like is the least of it: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/may/19/fetty-wap-i-didnt-even-get-to-use-no-bed\">Fetty Wap</a> has one eye. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/jul/28/gucci-mane-everybody-looking-review-trap-stars-quickfire-post-prison-set\">Gucci Mane</a> has an ice cream cone tattooed on his face, and they\u2019re both still great,\u201d he says. \u201cThat\u2019s what I love about hip-hop: it challenges the norms of what we, especially as black men should be and look like. It welcomes the freaks and the ones who haven\u2019t been heard.\u201d</p> <p>Is that what Atlanta is doing? \u201cI don\u2019t want to say it\u2019s necessary, but it is absolutely necessary,\u201d he says.

  "<p>A new scheme to ease bureaucratic obstacles blocking access to health and education for hundreds of thousands of American-born children living in Mexico has been launched by the US and Mexican governments.<br></p> <p>About 550,000 children born in the US are currently living across Mexico as a result of an increased number of deportations and voluntary repatriations driven by the US economic downturn and family obligations. <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.latimes.com/world/mexico-americas/la-fg-mexico-schools-americans-20150309-story.html\">These children face an array of legal and social difficulties assimilating into their new lives</a>, including language and culture barriers, bullying, mental health problems and long delays getting into school. </p> <p>Children born overseas to one or both Mexican parents are automatically entitled to Mexican nationality under the constitution, and should be guaranteed equal access to government services. But until now, unless parents registered their child\u2019s birth in a Mexican consulate before leaving the US, obtaining the required documents once back in Mexico has been expensive and burdensome. </p> <p>As a result, at least 300,000 US-born children have not registered their Mexican nationality, according to the Mexican national statistics institute. These children are often excluded from school, scholarships, social programmes and even basic health services such as vaccinations.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/13/immigration-us-children-migrants-returned-to-mexico\">Uprooted in Mexico: the US children 'returned' to a country they barely know</a> </p> </aside>  <p>This is because Mexican civil registries required the original US birth certificate to be sent to the state where the child was born for an official stamp \u2013 known as an <em class=\"\" style=\"display: none;\">apostille</em> \u2013 and an official translation. This has proven most difficult for parents living in remote rural parts of Mexico with limited access to the internet, credit cards and courier services.</p> <p>In June, the Guardian reported the case of Karla Ram\u00edrez, 16, who was born in Oregon but returned to live in rural Oaxaca with her family.

It is unknown how many others have returned voluntarily, often taking their US-born children with them. </p> <p>The scheme, which will be piloted first, means families can now present their children\u2019s US birth certificate to the civil registry and the Mexican national population registry will verify that it exists through the US National Association for Public Health Statistics and Information, which consolidates birth records electronically. </p> <p>Gretchen Kuhner, director of the Institute for Women in Migration (IMUMI), said the agreement was an important step in easing the burden for transnational families. </p> <p>\u201cThese children have been in a sort of legal limbo \u2013 they have US birth certificates and the right to Mexican nationality, but with no document to prove it, they have often been considered foreigners and turned down for social programmes including medical attention and scholarships, a serious concern.\u201d</p>",

Gubbins is at the end of a prolific season that has taken him close to England selection and has made 96 of Middlesex\u2019s 168 for 5. </p> <p>It has been a battle, in keeping with the status of the fixture and no less than we might have expected. There is not a huge amount to be gained from the pitch for Yorkshire\u2019s five seamers, although there has been what appears to be some reverse swing for Tim Bresnan, who sent down a challenging spell from the Pavilion end that tested Gubbins to the full. </p> <p>When the hardness goes from the ball it is playing sluggishly. Yorkshire have not helped their cause, though, with their catching \u2013 or lack of it. Three chances have gone down, two of them offered by Gubbins, and the other by the Middlesex captain Franklin.</p> <p>It was lovely at lunchtime to see old colleagues: Gatt, Peter Parfitt, JT Murray, Harry Latchman, Clive Radley as well as John Hampshire.

Perhaps this pitch is too flat. Somerset\u2019s three victories here have come without them achieving any batting points but at tea they have reached the dizzy heights of 215-2. Chris Rogers has hit his second century for the club, an exhibition of supreme efficiency rather than elegance, but no one gives a fig about that.</p> <p>Meanwhile, James Hildreth has produced one of his gutsiest innings. He has faced more demanding bowling but never in such pain. He was hit on the right foot on 7 and has been hobbling ever since, with Tom Abell acting as his runner. Once when Hildreth swivelled to hook a bouncer from Hutton he was obviously in agony. Otherwise he seems to have made a virtue of his movements being restricted. His head has been textbook static and he has not been able to indulge in his usual array of sweeps, whether orthodox or reverse.

Or simply in keeping with what has been an underwhelming red ball season? </p> <p>Lancashire have stuck to their task on a pitch offering a little bit of encouragement and now have two bonus points to show for it. Three wickets fell in the afternoon session for 82 runs, the first two via Kyle Jarvis, who trapped Ian Bell lbw for 37 and then, in the following over, produced a slingshot direct hit from mid-off to see Tim Ambrose run out for a duck. Ambrose did hesitate, although Sam Hain\u2019s call was not exactly what the situation called for. He and Rikki Clarke then added 37 for the sixth wicket until the returning Jordan Clark had the latter lbw playing the pull shot to a ball that kept low. </p> <p>The Ambrose wicket aside, Hain has looked very competent \u2013 Trott-esque, even \u2013 and is now 46 not out, with Keith Barker on seven for company. </p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57e1411be4b05714d0da2ac3\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/paulweaver\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-20T14:04:40.339Z\">3.04pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Spinners Borthwick and Pringle have been twirling away as if to suggest they own the match on day one. The temerity of it all!</p> <p>But James Vince, thrillingly, is having none of it and has counterattacked in eye-catching style, driving both through the covers for four. Then, in the same over, he swept Pringle to square-leg for four before lofting him over mid-on for six.</p> <p>At the other end Smith looked in danger of being overtaken by the new dasher \u2013 so he got out. He had made 90 when he miscued a drive off Carse and was caught by Pringle at point.</p> <p>Vince has sprinted to 70. Pringle, who was hit out of the attack at one stage, has returned to attack the left-handed Sean Ervine. Hampshire are 240 for three and could be on the way to making a match-winning score on a pitch that can only get more difficult.</p> <p>I have just bumped into the delightful Mike Taylor, who played for Notts and Hampshire and once took 99 wickets in a season, so no mean bowler. At 73 he keeps sprightly by playing golf and recalling tales of the great Sir Garfield Sobers, who joined Notts in 1968 and immediately lifted them from bottom but one to fourth in the championship. </p> <p>Mike has countless yarns about Garry\u2019s wild declarations and inspired batting and bowling performances. Many say he was the finest batsman they ever saw. I also remember Tom Graveney telling me he was the best bowler he ever faced \u2013 and Tom played for a long time.

A full length delivery from Jake Ball hit that foot and he can barely move. He has had Tom Abell to run for him \u2013 although you can be more or less guaranteed that Marcus Trescothick would have volunteered.

Nick Compton played one lovely on-drive but was out for eight soon after, another lbw for Jack Brooks. </p> <p>The next man in, Dawid Malan, rattled along to 22 at a run a ball. He was dropped once by Adam Lyth at slip and then played on attempting another luxurious cover drive off of David Willey, the ball shooting off the inside edge into his stumps. </p> <p>In between those two moments, Nick Gubbins was dropped, too, by Azeem Rafiq at point. Gubbins also survived a hearty lbw appeal from Steve Patterson. Since then, things have settled down. Gubbins is still there, on 42, along with Stevie Eskinazi, 7, \u201cthe evil eskimo\u201d as Selve called him when he came in. You might have to think about that a little bit. I did. It got me to wondering whether or not Eskinazi, who was born in South Africa, is Jewish. </p> <p>A website called \u201cHebrew T Shirts\u201d <a href=\"http://www.hebrewtshirts.com/view/28162/i-love-stevie-eskinazi-hebrew-sports-athletes-t-shirt\">http://www.hebrewtshirts.com/view/28162/i-love-stevie-eskinazi-hebrew-sports-athletes-t-shirt</a> seems to suggest that he is. And that, in turn, led to a long conversation that produced a short list of Jewish Test cricketers. It is, I think, at least the third time Selve and I have had this conversation in the 10 years we\u2019ve been working together. This is, of course, his Lordship\u2019s last match for the Guardian.

  "<p>From the moment the ceasefire in Syria started on Monday evening last week, President Bashar al-Assad made his intentions perfectly clear.<br></p> <p>First he went to Daraya, a Damascus suburb, and vowed to take back the entire country; then his regime repeatedly blocked or stalled attempts by aid convoys to travel into besieged areas, in contravention of the terms of the deal; and, having declared the ceasefire over, an airstrike \u2013 presumed to be either by the Syrians or their Russian backers \u2013 decimated a convoy carrying UN-supplied food destined for a rebel-held area of Aleppo countryside. </p> <p>Aid workers were among the dead.</p> <p>This behaviour underlines not just Assad\u2019s confidence that he is unlikely to face any sanction but also <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/12/life-saving-un-aid-regularly-fails-reach-besieged-syrians\">the difficulties faced by aid groups, particularly the UN</a>.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2016/sep/20/un-general-assembly-obama-final-address-syria-ceasefire-refugees-live-updates\">Obama calls for 'hard diplomacy' in Syria in final address to UN general assembly \u2013 live</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Its agencies cannot and have never been able to take aid and food to the places they want, exactly when they want. </p> <p>A stipulation of being allowed into the country is that the UN has to abide by rules set by the Syrian government; so Assad prescribes which organisations the UN can work with, and he and his ministers determine when and where many UN convoys can go.

But most believe there will be no change to the Bank of Japan\u2019s inflation target of 2%. James Stanley, currency analyst at DailyFX, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The big question is whether this review will lead-in to more stimulus or an introduction of monetary prudence. Many are questioning Japan\u2019s ability to do more stimulus given the size of their programs over the past four years; although in that last Bank of Japan press conference [governor Haruhiko] Kuroda addressed this head on, sharing his view that the BoJ hasn\u2019t yet hit the limits of monetary expansion.</p> <p>But there are some very big peripheral questions to be answered by the BoJ in this review, as in what are they going to do about the 2% target that they announced in April 2013 that they said they expected to hit in 2 years? That was April of 2015, or approximately 17 months ago, and yet we\u2019re still very far away from that target being realistically met. Also at issue are negative rates...would they dare to do more here given that results have been non-existent? And in terms of asset purchases: The BoJ has been buying \u00a580 Trillion a year in assets for a few years now. They\u2019re already cornering their own government bond market. Does the BoJ dare do more after four years have shown little hope of actually kick-starting inflation?</p> <p>So, nobody really knows what the BoJ will say during this review to be released tonight. This could lead to hazardous conditions if trading around the Yen as markets are appearing to approach tonight\u2019s event rather tepidly under the same guise of uncertainty that we are.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"441ab4dd8034baa79a7e513e2158ba34ecb2499a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/441ab4dd8034baa79a7e513e2158ba34ecb2499a/0_0_3000_1801/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Bank of Japan governor Haruhiko Kuroda.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bank of Japan governor Haruhiko Kuroda.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kazuhiro Nogi/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Simon MacAdam at Capital Economics said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We expect the BoJ to cut its policy rate deeper into negative territory today which, according to the Overnight Index Swap market, does not appear to be expected until early next year.</p> <p>Admittedly, it is more difficult to gauge where we sit relative to the market on the prospects for further unconventional policy easing in Japan. But we suspect that we are more dovish.</p> <p>[There has been] speculation that there will be a policy shift away from asset purchases. Indeed, the yield curve has steepened recently in anticipation of the BoJ adopting this stance: long-dated yields have hit six-month highs this month.</p> <p>We believe, though, that the BoJ\u2019s Comprehensive Policy Review will throw open the door to innovative policy measures. Rather than scale back its asset purchases, we think that the Bank may increase them and is more likely to find other ways to support systemically-important institutions, such as lending to commercial banks at negative interest rates.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"66da18b63c0c9f526f652fcf3ac3f836ed5dfa53\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/66da18b63c0c9f526f652fcf3ac3f836ed5dfa53/0_39_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Bank of Japan building in Tokyo.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Bank of Japan building in Tokyo.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Toru Hanai / Reuters/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57e14e39e4b0603ea33c4492\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-20T15:10:51.172Z\">4.10pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Pound hits five year low against the dollar</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The pound has hit a five year low against the dollar, weighed down by concerns about the economic risks of Brexit.</p> <p>Sterling fell as low as $1.2948 and is currently down 0.55% at $1.2950 amid worries about the outcome of talks about Britain leaving the European Union, especially with some EU members promising there would be no easy ride.</p> <p>The strength of the dollar is also a factor, with the outside chance of a US rate rise at this week\u2019s Federal Reserve meeting.

Our focus must then broaden to root out the many other firms who are reaping the benefits from the so-called \u2018gig economy\u2019 at the expense of workers.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe government must now reopen the Employment Review launched in 2014 [1], which could clarify and strengthen the employment status of up to a million British workers. It should also act quickly to crack down on employers like Sports Direct. Ending zero-hour contracts, guaranteeing trade union access to all workplaces and introducing a genuine living wage are just a few steps which would make a huge difference to millions of working people\u2019s lives.\u201d</p> </blockquote> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2016/jun/15/he-truth-about-working-for-deliveroo-uber-and-the-on-demand-economy\">The truth about working for Deliveroo, Uber and the on-demand economy</a> </p> </aside> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-09-20T10:52:01.971Z\">at 11.52am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57e0f93ae4b0ef60eaef118b\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-20T09:07:56.254Z\">10.07am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Reaction to Mike Ashley\u2019s interview, and the new independent inquiry into his company, is still coming in.</p> <p>Lecturer and consultant Hayley Lewis says the \u201cI didn\u2019t know\u201d defence simply isn\u2019t acceptable.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/Haypsych/status/778152039285190656\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">&quot;I didn&#39;t know&quot; is not OK reason.

The city has seen <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/13/new-york-muslim-woman-set-on-fire-eid-al-adha\">an uptick in attacks against Muslims</a> in recent weeks, which was most starkly felt in August, when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/18/new-york-queens-imam-hate-crime-muslim-activists\">an imam and his friend</a> were both shot in the back of the head in Queens, while walking home from midday prayers. </p> <p>Researchers at California State University found that negative statements about Muslims by politicians following terrorist attacks was one of the driving factors for increased hate crimes. They compared former president George W Bush\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=liudIJFg8UQ\">visit to a mosque</a> following 9/11 to proclaim \u201cIslam is peace\u201d, with Trump\u2019s speech to ban all Muslims from entering the US following attacks in San Bernardino. The former was followed by a range of 46% to 66% decline in hate crimes against Muslims, while the latter was followed by an increase of 87.5%.</p> <p>Muslims in New Jersey came into the spotlight when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/nov/23/donald-trump-accused-of-hate-campaign-after-claiming-thousands-cheered-on-911\">Trump claimed</a> last year that Muslims in Jersey City celebrated when the Twin Towers fell on 9/11. His claims were <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/nov/22/donald-trump/fact-checking-trumps-claim-thousands-new-jersey-ch/\">widely discredited</a>, including by <a href=\"http://www.njtvonline.org/news/video/jersey-city-responds-to-trumps-claims-of-muslim-cheering-on-911/\">Jersey City\u2019s mayor</a>. </p> <p>\u201cThese comments are extremely divisive to our nation,\u201d Awad said. \u201cEvents like these add to the complexity.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhen he said it, I thought he was crazy,\u201d said Muryd Williams, 24, who performs the call to prayer at Dar ul-Islam mosque. \u201cHave you been on Manhattan island by the ferries and looked over at Jersey City? How can you see anybody from over there?</p> <p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter what anybody says. If Trump says that we\u2019re the best people he ever met or we\u2019re the worst people he ever met,\u201d he continued. \u201cPeople are gonna hate us regardless.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>The actor Charmian Carr, who has died from complications relating to dementia aged 73, was a supporting player who appeared in only one feature film. But that film was the perennially popular, five-Oscar-winning <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2007/sep/21/musical\" title=\"\">The Sound of Music </a>(1965), which has attracted obsessive devotion from legions of fans.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/sep/18/charmian-carr-liesl-in-the-sound-of-music-dies-aged-73\">Charmian Carr \u2013 Liesl von Trapp in The Sound of Music \u2013 dies, aged 73</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Radiating youthful charm, Carr played Liesl, the slightly rebellious oldest daughter of the Von Trapp children, all seven of whom sang and danced to <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLm07s8fnzM\" title=\"\">Do-Re-Mi</a>, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CaD9Ozdthg8\" title=\"\">The Lonely Goatherd</a> and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qy9_lfjQopU\" title=\"\">So Long, Farewell</a>. However, it was in the duet <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwK_WOXjfc0\" title=\"\">Sixteen Going On Seventeen</a> that Carr had a chance to shine. Liesl makes a play for Rolfe (Daniel Truhitte), the blond telegram delivery boy, singing \u201cI need someone older and wiser, Telling me what to do. You are 17 going on 18. I\u2019ll depend on you.\u201d When a storm breaks out, the couple shelter in a gazebo, where they dance romantically, ending with Rolfe giving Liesl a quick kiss, to her obvious delight. Carr later reprises the song in a duet with Maria (Julie Andrews), the fresh-faced singing&nbsp;governess.</p> <p>Carr was 21 going on 22 when she got the role of Liesl. She was a student attending San Fernando Valley State College, California, studying speech therapy and philosophy, and working in a lab for a doctor, as well as modelling on the side, when her mother arranged for her to audition for a role in The Sound of Music, although she had never&nbsp;sung or danced professionally. Yet&nbsp;the producer-director <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2005/sep/16/guardianobituaries.film\" title=\"\">Robert Wise</a> chose her&nbsp;over several other beginners,&nbsp;including Mia Farrow, Geraldine Chaplin and Teri Garr, and changed her surname from Farnon to Carr.</p> <p>She was born in Chicago, Illinois, to Rita Oehmen, a vaudeville performer, and Brian Farnon, a musician. Her winning the role of Liesl came after a&nbsp;four-month search by Wise. She could&nbsp;never have imagined how popular&nbsp;The Sound of Music was to become. With its catchy Rodgers and Hammerstein songs, the film, set in spectacular Tyrolean scenery and shot in magnificent Todd-AO and De Luxe Color, grossed $200m worldwide on its&nbsp;first release.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"50b00a172743400f854de00463ef71d65775a0b1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/50b00a172743400f854de00463ef71d65775a0b1/266_315_1367_1367/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Charmian Carr ran an interior design firm in California, whose clients included Michael Jackson.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Charmian Carr ran an interior design firm in California, whose clients included Michael Jackson.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Karen Robinson/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>More recently, since 1999, it has engendered a Sing-Along-A-Sound of Music, an interactive entertainment in which audiences dress up as characters from the film, and sing all the songs. Carr, who attended many a cast reunion, felt that singing along was a perfect therapy for people\u2019s woes.</p> <p>In 1966, she co-starred with <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/obituary-anthony-perkins-1551325.html\" title=\"\">Anthony Perkins</a> in Evening Primrose, a 60- minute musical written by Stephen Sondheim. The haunting work takes place after closing in a department store inhabited by night people, including Carr as a 19-year-old who has lived in the store since she was six. She and Perkins, as a poet seeking refuge, fall in love and attempt to escape. Carr\u2019s poignant performance, which included singing <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-0OUDs9KRE\" title=\"\">Take Me to the World</a> and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UEkR1z4RRq8\" title=\"\">I Remember</a>, makes one wonder why she did not become a star.</p> <p>Perhaps one reason was her marriage, in 1967, to a dentist, Jay Brent, with whom she had two daughters. (They divorced in 1991.) However, she later ran an interior design firm, Charmian Carr Designs, in Encino, California. Among her faithful clients was Michael Jackson, who became a friend.</p> <p>She also wrote two books (co-written by Jean Strauss), Forever Liesl (2000) and Letters to Liesl (2001), inevitably dominated by her candid reminiscences of the shooting of The Sound of Music and its aftermath. In the memoirs, Carr revealed that she had a \u201chuge crush\u201d on Christopher Plummer, 13 years her senior, who played Captain von Trapp, her handsome widower father in the film.</p> <p>Carr is survived by her daughters, Jenifer and Emily.</p> <p>\u2022 Charmian Carr (Charmian Anne Farnon), actor, born 27 December 1942; died 17 September 2016</p>",

  "<p>Doctors\u2019 leaders have criticised plans to force all hospital consultants to reveal how much they earn from treating private patients on top of their NHS work.</p> <p>Consultants reacted angrily to the move, which they claimed was unfair and amounted to \u201csmearing\u201d senior doctors who devoted their lives to the NHS. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/sep/20/are-you-an-nhs-consultant-who-takes-on-private-work\">Are you an NHS consultant who takes on private work?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The Hospital Consultants and Specialists Association (HCSA) said publication could unfairly tarnish the reputation of the medical profession because most senior doctors did no private work. </p> <p>\u201cDoctors across the UK work hard, often beyond their contracted hours, to deliver for NHS patients. Yet once again we are seeing a few individual cases being used to misrepresent an entire profession, a large majority of whom do no private work at all,\u201d said Eddie Saville, the union\u2019s chief executive. </p> <p>Consultants who contacted the HCSA in the wake of the announcement voiced concern that NHS England was \u201csmearing doctors, portraying them as highly paid and overpaid\u201d. There was also suspicion that the move was designed to deflect attention from problems in the NHS. </p> <p>Saville took a thinly veiled swipe at NHS England, which has decided to compel all hospitals to disclose their consultants\u2019 private earnings through a register that will come into effect from next year. It is making the change after a review of conflicts of interest across the NHS. </p> <p>\u201cOne has to question the motivation for publicising this at a time when there are far bigger issues elsewhere,\u201d said Saville, whose organisation represents about 3,000 of the 40,000 consultants working in the NHS in England. Highlighting consultants\u2019 private income would do nothing to tackle problems such as underfunding of the NHS, growing demand, low morale and understaffing, he added. </p> <p>He denied that doctors who undertook private work were shortchanging their NHS patients. \u201cNHS hospital doctors already agree with their trusts a job plan including their NHS and private practice, so the idea that this is somehow impacting on NHS patient care doesn\u2019t add up,\u201d he said. </p> <p>The British Medical Association stressed that consultants only took on private work after first offering to do extra hours for their NHS trust. </p> <p>\u201cUnder the terms of the consultant contract, if a doctor wishes to undertake private work, they have to first offer extra time to the health service on top of any working hours they already perform,\u201d said Dr Keith Brent, the chair of the consultants committee at the doctors\u2019 union. </p> <p>In addition, he said, consultants, like all other senior NHS staff, were required to make an annual declaration of substantial conflicts of interest in accordance with legislation. </p> <p>The HCSA and BMA were responding to comments by the NHS England chairman, Prof Sir Malcolm Grant, that in the conflicts of interest review \u201cprivate medicine came up as an area of concern, particularly in the larger teaching hospitals\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not an attempt to curb private work by consultants. Let\u2019s just have some transparency here. Much of what goes on in these communities is almost under the radar,\u201d Grant told the Times. </p> <p>Specialties such as surgery, anaesthesia, cardiac care, ophthalmology and obstetrics and gynaecology often throw up opportunities for consultants to undertake private work, particularly in cities such as London. But other branches of medicine, including geriatrics and acute medicine, do not. </p> <p>Data collected by the Royal College of Physicians, which represents hospital doctors in England, shows that in 2015-16 consultants in 30 different medical specialties worked on average 46.4 hours a week for their NHS trust \u2013 4.3 unpaid hours more than the 42.1 hours they were typically contracted to undertake. </p> <p>NHS Digital\u2019s most recent figures for the annual earnings of the health service\u2019s 1.4m staff in England showed that doctors of all types, apart from GPs and locums, earned an average of \u00a359,588 last year from the NHS, 0.4% more than the year before. </p> <p>However, while consultants received mean annual basic pay of \u00a383,746, their average mean earnings overall from the NHS were \u00a3111,863, once \u00a328,117 of other earnings was taken into account. </p> <p>More than 10% of doctors earn between \u00a385,000-\u00a391,000, almost 11% are paid \u00a397,000-\u00a3103,000, and more than 6% earn \u00a391,000-\u00a397,000, according to the figures. </p> <p>Small numbers of doctors earn more than \u00a3103,000-\u00a3109,000. </p> <p>Labour\u2019s Diane Abbott, the shadow health secretary, welcomed the \u201clong overdue\u201d transparency over consultants\u2019 income from both private practice and also in payments from drug companies. </p> <p>But she added: \u201cThis new transparency should be extended. The government should publish in full how much the private sector is siphoning from the NHS, including via their own new sustainability and transformation plans.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>In the wake of the conviction this week at Bristol crown court of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/sep/20/detective-chris-halliwell-reveal-killed-others-becky-godden-sian-o-callaghan\" title=\"\">taxi driver Chris Halliwell</a> for the murder of Becky Godden, there has been much anger expressed over what happened to the detective, Steve Fulcher, who <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/oct/19/sian-ocallaghan-murder-detective\" title=\"\">obtained a confession from Halliwell</a> that was deemed inadmissible as he had not yet been given access to a lawyer. This not only allowed Halliwell initially to escape justice for Godden\u2019s murder but also led to Fulcher\u2019s career being derailed; he was found to have committed misconduct, was given a final written warning, resigned from the police and now works as a security consultant in Somalia.</p> <p>It would be hard not to feel both sympathy and admiration for Fulcher. He was faced with Halliwell, one of the most odious and devious of killers. Fulcher was clearly driven by the best of motives, and there must be questions asked as to whether the disciplinary process to which he was subjected could have been handled with greater understanding. We have all watched television dramas in which a maverick cop\u2019s efforts to nail an evil villain are negated on a technicality by some pen-pushing senior officer, but it would be a mistake to imagine that because of this one highly emotive case that the rules introduced by the <a href=\"http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1984/60/contents\" title=\"\">1984 Police and Criminal Evidence Act</a> should be scrapped or weakened.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/sep/20/detective-chris-halliwell-reveal-killed-others-becky-godden-sian-o-callaghan\">Chris Halliwell officer in talks with police forces over serial killer fears</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Turn the clock back to the 1970s when the art of \u201cverballing\u201d \u2013 attributing incriminating words to a defendant \u2013 was endemic. This was seen as \u201cnoble cause corruption\u201d and often justified on the grounds that too many criminals were getting away with crimes thanks to their slippery solicitors and use of loopholes in the law. The verbals gradually became increasingly sophisticated, moving on from the traditional \u201cit\u2019s a fair cop, guv\u201d to more convincing lines such as \u201cyou\u2019ll never prove it\u201d or \u201cwho ratted on us?\u201d</p> <p>One former crime reporter who worked in east London in the 1970s recounted to me this tale: a local solicitor who had a client in custody came into the police station and left a Daily Mirror and a toothbrush for him with a detective. Inside the Mirror, the lawyer had written \u201cCharlie, under no circumstances say anything\u201d. The detective duly bought another copy of the paper and wrote \u201cCharlie, it\u2019s all right, I\u2019ve straightened everything out for you. Tell them everything they want to know.\u201d When the lawyer came back four hours later and said, \u201cCan I see my client?\u201d he was told: \u201cYes you can, but he\u2019s admitted the offence and 15 other TICs [taken into consideration].\u201d</p> <p>All very <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/tvandradioblog/2007/apr/11/lifeonmarstheperfectfinal\" title=\"\">Life on Mars</a> and uncontroversial, perhaps, when chummy was a professional criminal. But when the suspect is a young, vulnerable, suggestible soul with learning difficulties who says whatever he thinks would please a detective, the reasons for the introduction of the rules become clear. Of the many miscarriages of justice that emerged from that era, a significant number were the result of \u201cconfessions\u201d from suspects who had been denied access to a lawyer.</p> <p>Halliwell will be sentenced later this week but he is already serving life for the murder of Sian O\u2019Callaghan. In was during the investigation of her disappearance that he admitted to Fulcher that he had also killed Godden. Fulcher has argued that he believed O\u2019Callaghan could still have been alive at the time, which was why he questioned Halliwell without giving him the chance to talk to a lawyer. But while there was enough other evidence to obtain a conviction in O\u2019Callaghan\u2019s case, the Godden confession could not be used in court.</p> <p>In 2014, Fulcher was duly criticised by the Independent Police Complaints Commission for failing to follow the rules and found guilty of misconduct. The IPCC described his actions as \u201ccatastrophic\u201d and concluded that \u201cit is not possible to determine what may or may not have happened if Mr Halliwell had been immediately conveyed to custody. The Police and Criminal Evidence Act and its codes of practice are not optional. They are a fundamental part of the criminal justice process and exist to ensure the rights of suspects, and therefore the integrity of the whole process, are protected.\u201d</p> <p>Fulcher, understandably, feels both justified in his action and dismayed by what happened to his career, over which he was taunted in court by Halliwell. He said after the verdict: \u201cWhen the extraordinary facts of this case are explained, it is likely to lead to a public crisis in the competence and credibility of the police service.\u201d But sympathy for a diligent detective should not be allowed to obscure the fact that the rules were changed to protect not just the vulnerable but the very credibility of the police service itself.</p>",

Authorities towed that car, along with a black Toyota, on Monday. In the FBI\u2019s wanted poster, authorities asked people to look out for a 2003 Blue Honda Civic.</p> <p>\u201cThey had a whole bunch of cars: two 2x4s, that black Toyota Camry, a white Infiniti and a blue car,\u201d said Torres.</p> <p>He described the news of a potential bomber just doors away as \u201cterrifying\u201d. \u201cI want to move.

  "<h2>The winner: Bridget Jones\u2019s Baby</h2> <p>The US opening may have offered a disappointing $8.6m (\u00a36.64m), but <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/sep/05/bridget-joness-baby-review-reborn-renee-zellweger-excels-in-fun-romp-heavy-with-expectation\">Bridget Jones\u2019s Baby</a> delivered a storming victory on home turf, with a UK debut of \u00a38.11m. That\u2019s the biggest opening ever for a film released in September, says distributor Universal.</p> <p>Ignoring preview numbers, Bridget Jones\u2019s Baby has the seventh biggest debut of the year, almost level with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/jul/28/finding-dory-review-pixar-nemo-ellen-degeneres\">Finding Dory</a> (\u00a38.12m) and behind <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/mar/22/batman-v-superman-dawn-of-justice-review-ben-affleck-henry-cavill\">Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/apr/20/captain-america-civil-war-review-an-aspartame-rush\">Captain America: Civil War</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/aug/02/suicide-squad-review-dc-comics-will-smith-margot-robbie-jared-leto\">Suicide Squad</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/feb/07/deadpool-review-marvel-ryan-reynolds-film-superhero\">Deadpool</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/apr/12/the-jungle-book-review\">The Jungle Book</a>.

Edge of Reason began with \u00a310.44m, but that includes previews of \u00a33.31m \u2013 so it was \u00a37.13m for the actual weekend period.

Like Bridget, it is the third instalment in a franchise and a belated sequel to a second episode (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/News_Story/Critic_Review/Guardian_review/0,,388403,00.html\">Book of Shadows</a>, released in 2000). This latest film took \u00a3959,000, and while it is some achievement to bring back audiences after the poorly received Book of Shadows, there seemed to be plenty of excitement about a successful creative revival of Blair Witch. Book of Shadows kicked off its UK run with \u00a31.09m, including \u00a3108,000 in previews.</p> <h2>The event: The Beatles</h2> <p>The Top 10 chart, below, suggests that Ron Howard\u2019s documentary <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/sep/15/the-beatles-eight-days-a-week-review-ron-howard-documentary\">The Beatles: Eight Days a Week \u2013 The Touring Years</a> has achieved a scorching site average, given an opening weekend gross of \u00a3655,000 from 96 sites. Indeed, the film has done well \u2013 but not that well on a per cinema basis. The \u00a3655,000 figure includes the special transmission on Thursday of the film\u2019s London premiere, which contributes \u00a3597,000 from 497 cinemas. Thereafter, it has been achieving spotty bookings \u2013 encore showings, in event cinema parlance.</p> <p>Comparisons are hard to make, although the previous week the Nick Cave documentary <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/sep/05/one-more-time-with-feeling-review-film-nick-cave-andrew-dominik-venice\">One More Time With Feeling</a> began with \u00a3343,000 from 59 sites, including \u00a3260,000 from a Thursday release in wider play.</p> <h2>The Irish hit: The Young Offenders</h2> <p>From a first-time feature director (Peter Foott) and starring two teenage actors also making their big-screen debuts (Alex Murphy, Chris Walley), Irish comedy The Young Offenders has delivered a robust debut in Ireland, with \u00a3172,000 from 65 sites. It premieres in the UK at the London film festival on 7 October. </p> <h2>The indie hit: Hunt for the Wilderpeople</h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZLsSChvm0qw\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ZLsSChvm0qw?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZLsSChvm0qw\">Watch the Hunt for the Wilderpeople trailer on YouTube</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>Taika Waititi, co-director of the New Zealand comedy <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/nov/20/what-we-do-in-shadows-review\">What We Do in the Shadows</a> has followed up with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/jan/23/hunt-for-the-wilderpeople-review-sam-neill-misfit-kid-kiwi-hit\">Hunt for the Wilderpeople</a>, which begins with an impressive \u00a3168,000 from 63 cinemas, including \u00a315,00 in previews. That compares with a debut of \u00a3128,000 from 33 cinemas, including previews of \u00a363,000, for Shadows.</p> <h2>Admissions update</h2> <p>Figures for August show 18.09m tickets were sold in the UK, up 26% up on the same month in 2015, and the biggest total for any month since August 2011. While admissions this year had been lagging behind 2015 levels, the strong showing in August means that they are now up 0.4% for the first eight months of the year. That\u2019s a surprising outcome, given the strong product in 2015, which saw admissions surge from 2014 levels. </p> <p>Star performers in August include Suicide Squad, Finding Dory and Jason Bourne. The challenge for 2016 in terms of continuing to match 2015 is the robust final quarter a year ago, which had <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/oct/21/spectre-review-james-bond-is-back-stylish-camp-and-sexily-pro-snowden\">Spectre</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/dec/16/star-wars-the-force-awakens-review-a-spectacular-homecoming\">Star Wars: The Force Awakens</a>.

  "<p>Before there was Isis, the extremist militant group responsible for the most brutal terrorist attacks and killings of recent years, there was Isis: an 11-year-old girl in Kent whose mother named her after the ancient Egyptian goddess of fertility, magic and motherhood. \u201cI was really proud of it,\u201d Isis Hales says. And now? \u201cI just \u2026\u201d she trails off and her mother, Lucy, steps in. \u201cYou wanted to change your name, didn\u2019t you?\u201d \u201cYeah,\u201d Isis replies quietly. \u201cThat was about four months ago.\u201d</p> <p>As <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/30/up-to-15000-bodies-may-be-buried-in-mass-graves-in-syria-and-iraq-survey\">Isis</a> has come to control vast swathes of territory in Syria and Iraq, and claimed responsibility for terrorist attacks all over the world, Isis has been bullied more at school. In a few years her name has gone from being \u201clovely and unusual\u201d to a byword for violent extremism and murder. \u201cIn year six,\u201d as she puts it, \u201cit really hit me in the face.\u201d It may be one of the less significant and visible consequences of the rise of the terrorist group, and specifically the increase in Islamic State being referred to as Isis, but for women and girls who find themselves sharing a name with a hardline jihadist network, life can be a nightmare.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not every single day,\u201d Isis insists, \u201cbut it doesn\u2019t seem to be stopping. When I was leaving primary school and we were all signing T-shirts to say goodbye, someone wrote \u2018ISIS\u2019 on mine. People call me a terrorist and ask me where\u2019s my machine gun. It\u2019s really difficult. I don\u2019t want to change my name any more but I want to do something about it.\u201d</p> <p>Lucy named her daughter Isis for a specific reason. \u201cI didn\u2019t think I could have children,\u201d she explains. \u201cWe tried for several years. I had IVF but got poorly, and then just before I started the treatment again I fell pregnant naturally. Isis is the Egyptian god of love and fertility and that\u2019s how she got her name. She was and is very special.\u201d</p> <p>The wife of Osiris and mother of Horus, god of the sun, <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/topic/Isis-Egyptian-goddess\">Isis was one of the most important goddesses of ancient Egypt</a>. Depicted as a woman with outstretched, winged arms and an empty throne on her headdress, she was revered as the people\u2019s goddess, teaching wisdom, agriculture and medicine. More than any other goddess, Isis represents the complete female. She has been worshipped for centuries; throughout ancient Egypt and the Roman empire, and today, by pagans all over the world as a potent symbol of feminism.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6e5e089430c69ac2448b73ddc11bcbacccbc6465\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6e5e089430c69ac2448b73ddc11bcbacccbc6465/72_12_309_562/275.jpg\" alt=\"Potent symbol of feminism ... ancient Egyptian sculpture of Isis seated on a throne suckling the infant Horus.

I loved my name. It was a good conversation starter and it made me feel a bit different.\u201d</p> <p>The first time she heard her name associated with Islamic State was in 2012 when she was sent an article about the jihadist group on Facebook with the comment: \u201cI see you\u2019ve been up to no good in the Middle East.\u201d \u201cIt was a joke, I suppose,\u201d she says uneasily. \u201cDisheartening, but I didn\u2019t think it would last.\u201d Unfortunately, it got worse. At work, where she wore a name badge, people started to comment on how unfortunate her name was and ask why she hadn\u2019t considered changed it. Earlier this year she was temporarily banned from Facebook. \u201cI tried to log in and got a message saying you can\u2019t have offensive words in your name,\u201d she tells me. \u201cMy mum was probably the most upset about it. She would never have wanted to choose an offensive name for me.\u201d</p> <p>Ironically, considering Isis\u2019s current association, the goddess Isis influenced both Muslim and Christian religions. The annual flooding of the Nile is still celebrated by Egyptian Muslims as a remembrance of Isis\u2019s grief at the death of Osiris causing the river to overflow. In the fourth century, Christian worshippers of Isis founded the first Madonna cults in her memory and some called themselves Pastophori, meaning shepherds of Isis. It is thought that ancient images of Isis nursing her infant son are the inspiration for the Madonna and child portraits depicted in centuries of religious art and iconography.</p> <p>Isis pops up in popular culture too, if you search \u201cIsis name\u201d on Google or visit Wikipedia\u2019s \u201cIsis disambiguation\u201d page. Isis is the name of a strange and lovely 1975 Bob Dylan ballad thought to be about the break-up with his then wife, Sara, that opens with, \u201cI married Isis on the fifth day of May \u2026\u201d. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bPnNA8yTD8E\">Isis is a 17th-century French opera</a> based on Ovid\u2019s Metamorphoses, a character in Stargate and Battleship Galactica, and the dog in Downton Abbey (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2014/nov/03/isis-in-crisis-is-downton-abbey-dog-best-character-die\">killed off in series five</a>, though Hugh Bonneville insisted anyone who thought this was because of the jihadist group was \u201ca complete berk\u201d). The Isis river is a section of the Thames running through Oxford, giving its name to the university boat club\u2019s reserve rowing team and to <a href=\"http://isismagazine.org.uk/about/\">the student magazine</a>. Victorians believed the Thames was correctly named the River Isis and some historians insist the name is part of Tamesis, the Latin name for the Thames. There are still Ordnance Survey maps that label the Thames as \u201cRiver Thames or Isis\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2b90123db2774e9c02dcc6e86aee94ddf57dc456\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2b90123db2774e9c02dcc6e86aee94ddf57dc456/0_726_4400_2640/1000.jpg\" alt=\"What\u2019s in a name?

One year later, it dropped off the list completely. Now even companies called Isis are changing their name, from a language school in Oxford to the World Meteorological Organisation replacing Hurricane Isis with Ivette. At the same time the discussion of what to call the terror organisation continues. Islamic State, which is how the group has referred to itself since 2014, has fallen out of favour because it wrongly presumes it is both Islamic and a legitimate state, and the BBC now refers to it as \u201cthe so-called Islamic State\u201d. UN and US officials generally use Isil, an acronym of the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant. When urging MPs to back bombing in Syria in 2015, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2015/dec/02/why-david-cameron-saying-daesh-not-isis-video\">David Cameron pledged he would solely use Daesh</a>, the Arabic acronym employed in the Middle East that the terrorist group reportedly professes to hate so much it threatened to cut out the tongues of anyone who uses it in public. Much of the media, including the Guardian, continues to use Isis.</p> <p>\u201cWhich means that whenever I say my name, terrorism becomes the topic of conversation,\u201d explains Isis Martinez, a 40-year-old woman based in Miami whose mother was also called Isis after the Egyptian goddess. In 2014 Martinez started a petition urging the media to stop using her name to describe the terrorist group. It gained more than 65,000 signatures but Martinez tells me life remains difficult and she now goes by a different name at work. \u201cI would rather not have to talk about terrorism all day, every day,\u201d she tells me. \u201cWith family and friends I\u2019m still Isis but at work I\u2019ve had to surrender to it. I would rather be happy than right. I can\u2019t fight the world.\u201d</p> <p>For all the women I speak to called Isis, the solution is for the media to stop using the acronym as if it were a name. \u201cI try and ignore it,\u201d Isis Hales says when I ask her how she responds to bullying. \u201cOr I say, \u2018You know I\u2019m not named after a terrorist, so why are you doing this?\u2019 I just don\u2019t understand it. I wouldn\u2019t do it to them.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIsis is going to secondary school [this year],\u201d her mother adds, \u201cand we are braced for pupils to say things like, \u2018Are you a terrorist?\u2019 It\u2019s inevitable.\u201d I ask Isis if there is anything else she would like to add. \u201cPlease,\u201d she replies without hesitation. \u201cJust stop using Isis.\u201d</p> <p><em>Some surnames have been changed</em></p>",

  "<p>In one of Michael Bell\u2019s earliest encounters with Tyre King, the sports coach had to sneak the boy into a Columbus, Ohio, recreation center to play basketball.

Police said King used a BB gun that resembled a genuine firearm to rob a Columbus resident of $10. When officers arrived, Tyre was spotted with two males who soon fled on foot. Moments later, police said, an officer fired \u201cmultiple\u201d times after Tyre reached for a BB gun in his waistband. He was pronounced dead at a hospital soon after.</p> <p>His death has gripped the Rust Belt city of 850,000, where residents protesting the shooting say uneven economic development has not benefited poorer neighborhoods like the one where Tyre lived. </p> <p>The environment Tyre was raised in mirrors \u201cso many young men\u201d in Columbus, said Mark Stansberry, Tyre\u2019s former hockey coach. \u201cA lot of dysfunctionality,\u201d he said, \u201cbut he was resilient.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe was \u2026 always coming in with that smile,\u201d Stansberry said. \u201cHis smile was as big as the helmet.\u201d </p> <p>Last Wednesday, around 7.45pm, Columbus police said officers were dispatched to respond to reports of an armed robbery of a man for $10. The victim said a suspect was carrying a Ruger pistol.<br></p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to mess with it over $10,\u201d the victim told the dispatcher. When police arrived, three males \u2013 including Tyre \u2013 matching the description of the suspects were spotted. Officers approached Tyre in an alley. Shortly after, police say Tyre reached for a BB gun from his waistband. It was then Mason, a nine-year veteran of the Columbus police division, shot King \u201cmultiple\u201d times.

Still, Evans said, the semblance of safety and access to opportunity isn\u2019t shared across the city\u2019s residents.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s this idea that Columbus is this place where we have low crime and we have affordable housing and job opportunities, but all of those things are only afforded to the few, and that few does include people of color,\u201d she said.</p> <p>At the rally on Monday, Evans and Fournier-Alsaada\u2019s group released a list of demands to the city\u2019s mayor, including a call to let residents shape the Summer Safety Initiative, new trauma service programs in areas affected by violence, and new community-policing initiatives.</p> <p>Standing nearby, Larry Robertson, a local musician, reflected on how his former hometown of Cleveland was rankled by the death of Tamir Rice, who was killed by police while carrying a pellet gun in a city park at 12 years old.</p> <p>\u201cBeing from Cleveland with Tamir, that really upset me,\u201d he said, adding: \u201cThen with it happening again here within a couple years.

A father of twin boys who are 10, the death of Tyre has been unnerving and \u201cscary\u201d, Thompson said.

  "<p>The independent presidential candidate <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/08/evan-mcmullin-republican-donald-trump-utah\">Evan McMullin</a> has linked Brexit and the rise of Donald Trump, saying such events are a \u201creflection of a nativist movement across Europe and in the United States\u201d that is \u201cdestructive to [the] economy here and in the world and to peace and security\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/18/donald-trumps-police-officers-backing-republican-have-murky-legal-histories\">Donald Trump's police: officers backing Republican have murky legal histories</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The 40-year-old former CIA agent and Capitol Hill policy adviser accused Russia of fueling such sentiments \u2013 a phenomenon he said he understood because when working for the US intelligence service he \u201creceived the same training that Vladimir Putin did\u201d while in the KGB.<br></p> <p>\u201cThey do it through supporting candidates like Donald Trump and Donald Trump poses a true threat to our national security by carrying Putin\u2019s water in the United States,\u201d he said.</p> <p>McMullin is running as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/08/republican-evan-mcmullin-presidential-run-trump\">an independent conservative alternative to Trump</a>, backed by some of the Republican nominee\u2019s most determined rightwing opponents. Speaking to the Guardian, he discussed his longshot bid for the White House and his disdain for those on the right who have failed to stand up to Trump, who is now closing in on Hillary Clinton <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/us/general_election_trump_vs_clinton-5491.html\">in presidential polling</a>.</p> <p>In McMullin\u2019s view, the forces that drove the British vote to leave the European Union and have aided the rise of Trump are part of the \u201csame movement, fueled largely by the Russians who seek to destabilize eastern and western Europe as well as North America through fomenting discord between different racial groups, different ethnic groups and different religious groups\u201d.</p> <p>McMullin, who spent a decade at the CIA, will make a foreign policy speech in Washington on Tuesday focusing on the global threats to US national security. </p> <p>He said he felt comfortable viewing Trump from Putin\u2019s perspective. \u201cI received the same training that Vladimir Putin did. He received it from KGB. I received it from the CIA. Vladimir Putin trained to identify weaknesses in people and exploit them for intelligence purposes.\u201d<br></p> <p>McMullin said Putin saw weaknesses in Trump \u2013 \u201cego, financial vulnerabilities\u201d \u2013 and also \u201cin a different sort of a way an alignment ideologically, at least as it pertains to leadership\u201d.</p> <p>As a political rookie and rank outsider, McMullin freely admits his own weakness. Aside from the benefits of understanding the Russian president, he says, there may not be \u201ca lot of parallels frankly, between what I am doing now and what I did in the CIA\u201d. He takes pains to note his experience working on Wall Street for Goldman Sachs, however, and as policy director for the House Republican Conference on Capitol Hill.</p> <h2><strong>\u2018I am not a racist and most Democrats aren\u2019t racists either\u2019</strong></h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/sep/16/donald-trump-barack-obama-birther-theory-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/53bhd\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2724745\"            data-video-name=\"A short history of Donald Trump's 'birther' conspiracy \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"ABC/The View, NBC/Today show, PBS Newshour, Donald Trump/YouTube, MSNBC\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-57dc5c11e4b0df02df202fd1\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/09/16/160916birther_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/09/16/160916birther.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/09/16/160916birther_WebM.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/sep/16/donald-trump-barack-obama-birther-theory-video\">Donald Trump\u2019s birther comments: a short history</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>McMullin has barely made a ripple since he declared his candidacy in August, motivated he said because he felt there had to be some alternative to the choices being offered. </p> <p>\u201cI firmly believe,\u201d he said, \u201cthat someone needed to step up and stand in contrast to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/17/elizabeth-warren-bernie-sanders-donald-trump-bigotry\">Donald Trump\u2019s bigoted rhetoric</a> and his allegiance to Vladimir Putin and at the same time to Hillary Clinton\u2019s promotion of large centralized government that is unaccountable to American people.\u201d </p> <p>He was dismissive of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/16/gary-johnson-and-jill-stein-not-allowed-in-first-televised-debate\">the Libertarian candidate, Gary Johnson</a>, whom he described as not \u201csuitable to be a leader of the free world\u201d. Johnson, a two-term Republican governor of New Mexico, has polled at around 8% nationally \u2013 not enough to qualify for the first presidential debate on 26 September. In contrast, McMullin has struggled to gain any traction at all. </p> <p>In one sense, that is part of his plan. As he is not on the ballot in enough states to get 270 electoral votes, it is impossible for him to win the White House outright. Therefore, his goal is to force and exploit electoral deadlock. The <a href=\"http://constitutioncenter.org/interactive-constitution/amendments/amendment-xii\">12th amendment</a> says that if no candidate receives 270 electoral votes, the House of Representatives chooses, with one vote for each state, from among the top three candidates who received electoral votes. McMullin is hoping to win such votes from at least one state in the Mountain West. In Utah, strongly conservative but also strongly anti-Trump, he is polling at 9%.</p> <p>Should deadlock be reached, McMullin imagines a whole new campaign in which he, Trump and Clinton would compete in the Republican-dominated House, a chamber where, he thinks, Clinton would never stand a chance. At that point, he thinks Republicans in the House would realize \u201cI am more aligned with them on issues than Trump\u201d and Democrats would support him too. </p> <p>\u201cI am not a racist and most Democrats aren\u2019t racists either,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Of course, McMullin acknowledges that such goals will be very difficult to achieve, depending as they do \u201con variables that we don\u2019t control and very few that we do\u201d. </p> <p>\u201cBut it is what it is,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are realistic about it.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>\u2018It\u2019s about trust more than issues\u2019</strong></h2> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/17/american-dream-divided-nation-equal-opportunity-trump-clinton-campaign\">Two American Dreams: how a dumbed-down nation lost sight of a great idea</a> </p> </aside>  <p>While his ambition relies on draining votes from Democrats as well as Republicans, McMullin did not have an immediate answer for why Democrats unhappy with Hillary Clinton, especially those who supported Bernie Sanders in the primary, should support him. </p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s a good question and I don\u2019t exactly know the answer to it,\u201d he said. \u201cI do have a theory based on some comments because we do have Bernie Sanders people coming to us saying we\u2019re going to support you and people who have supported Hillary Clinton but have grown concerned about the stories that have come out about Clinton Foundation and other things.\u201d </p> <p>Such people, he said, knew they didn\u2019t agree with him on many issues, particularly social concerns, but viewed him as trustworthy in a way Clinton is not. \u201cIt\u2019s about trust more than issues,\u201d he said.</p> <p>McMullin has taken some stances that do not accord with mainstream conservative thought. He believes human activity contributes to climate change and sees the environment and racism as two issues \u201cwhere the Republican party is stuck in the past \u2026 making it unable to lead the country forward.\u201d </p> <p>However, he is staunchly conservative on a number of other issues. He is pro-life and would hope to appoint supreme court justices in the mold of Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas. His campaign is planning to follow Trump in releasing a list of judges who would be appointed if he were elected. It will include some names on the list <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/may/18/donald-trump-supreme-court-picks-conservatives\">the Republican nominee released</a> in May.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I believe Donald Trump poses a true threat to our constitution and those who support him are sustaining that threat</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>McMullin seems most concerned with saving the Republican party from itself. \u201cAnyone who supports Donald Trump is someone who I think is not too committed to the constitution,\u201d he said. \u201cI believe Donald Trump poses a true threat to our constitution and those who support him are sustaining that threat.\u201d </p> <p>He was disappointed that Republican elected officials are still supporting Trump, for what he said were selfish reasons.</p> <p>\u201cI have conversations with Republicans on the Hill about this very issue,\u201d he said. \u201cThey tell me about Donald Trump, they know his allegiance to Vladimir Putin is very dangerous to this country, they tell me that they know his racist rhetoric and racist nature of his support is damaging and dangerous to his country. </p> <p>\u201cBut they also say they are afraid to speak out against him and remove their either silent support for him or vocal support for him \u2026 because they fear doing so would cause them to lose their seat in Congress.\u201d<br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/09/evan-mcmullin-hurting-trumps-chances-or-improving\">Evan McWho isn't the guy to save us from Trump's evil grip | Jimmy Camp</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Other than Utah, the other poll number touted by the McMullin campaign is 3% in Virginia.

If the GOP sticks with Trump, he worries, \u201cas his bigotry becomes more front and center, even as the alt-right becomes more vocal and it\u2019s more and more clear that they contribute heavily to the empowerment of his campaign\u201d, the party will sign its own death warrant. </p> <p>He doubts whether the Republican party \u201cwill be able to make the kinds of reforms they need to make to be a competitive party on a national level,\u201d he said.</p> <p>He hopes to build something for the conservative movement, \u201csomething that will be a place for [conservatives] \u2026 something that has real traction and real influence and it will be either to influence the Republican party or potentially start our own\u201d.</p>",

Apple\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/jun/13/mac-os-sierra-apple-os-x-siri-desktop-wwdc\">new version of its Mac operating system</a> \u2013 Sierra \u2013 will be available for download later today.<br></p> <p>The free upgrade is available for almost any Mac from late 2009 and will be available via the Mac App Store later today. While some might want to hold off immediately updating, given the recent trouble with early updates, here are five new things to be found by those who do wish to change to macOS Sierra.</p> <h2>1. Siri</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"13c069743be6ebf3631b4cc569b8adbc00d270ea\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/13c069743be6ebf3631b4cc569b8adbc00d270ea/0_0_2248_1349/1000.jpg\" alt=\"siri\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Siri is now available on your desktop or laptop.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Apple</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The biggest change for Sierra other than the name is Siri. The same voice assistant from the iPhone and iPad is now on the Mac with similar features and faults. It can find files for you using natural language as introduced with El Capitan, set appointments, check spellings, play music and tell you the weather, but how much you use it depends on where you work: colleagues in your open-plan office aren\u2019t going to love the fact that you just started talking to your computer.</p> <h2>2. Universal clipboard</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f706a0b14b42e679115dc4062345d4964ea4cbc1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f706a0b14b42e679115dc4062345d4964ea4cbc1/0_0_2317_1390/1000.jpg\" alt=\"universal clipboard\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Universal clipboard means you can copy on one machine and paste on another without having to send any files or communications between the two.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Apple</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Have you ever wanted to paste something between two Macs or a Mac and an iPhone or iPad? Now you can. Just copy something on one machine, hit paste on the other and wait. Sometimes it takes a while, depending on how good your connection is, but it works surprisingly well. It works for text, images and most other things you might copy to the clipboard.</p> <h2>3. iCloud drive desktop</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cba0be4c09b3c76b41b48e33feb29ba84632a0a8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cba0be4c09b3c76b41b48e33feb29ba84632a0a8/0_0_2333_1400/1000.jpg\" alt=\"icloud drive desktop\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">iCloud Drive transports all the files on your desktop between machines.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Apple</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>While some are organised and store all their files in carefully organised folders, many just have everything dumped on the desktop and locked on a single machine. iCloud Drive desktop can now sync files and folders on the desktop between machines and to iPhones or iPads, so everything not organised is accessible from multiple machines.</p> <h2>4. Everything is in a tab now</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"57517b7d8904b386219354ad85c0af53bba78501\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/57517b7d8904b386219354ad85c0af53bba78501/0_0_1380_828/1000.jpg\" alt=\"macos\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">View documents and other multiple-window apps in tabbed view, as watch the odd video over the top at the same time with picture-in-picture display.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Apple</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The tabbed interface kickstarted by browsers has now come to more or less everything in Sierra. From text editors to photos editing, budgeting apps and email, hitting the \u201cMerge All Windows\u201d option under the Window drop down in the status bar merges the windows from one app into one tabbed interface. Not everything supports it immediately, and some that do have half-baked implementations, but if you wanted tabs everywhere on a Mac, now\u2019s your chance.</p> <h2>5. Apple Pay, iOS 10 features and more</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d3dba346661025c1bb6de18ba5a9bd0510406079\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d3dba346661025c1bb6de18ba5a9bd0510406079/0_0_2280_1368/1000.jpg\" alt=\"photos\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">View your memories within Photos.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Apple</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Aside from big Mac features, MacOS Sierra also adds compatibility with most of the new features from iOS 10. Now you can pay for things using your Touch ID sensor on your iPhone on the web, you can send fancy chat things with iOS 10 users in Messages, view videos handled by the Quicktime Player in a floating window, and even unlock your Mac using an Apple Watch, if you own one. Apple Music in iTunes now looks more like the iOS version too, and the Memories feature from the iOS Photos app is now in the MacOS Sierra Photos app. MacOS also promises to free up some space on your Mac by storing unused files within iCloud drive, but how much space it can free up depends on what types of files are taking up your hard drive.</p> <ul> <li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/sep/13/ios-10-apple-new-iphone-ipad\"><strong>iOS 10: the top 10 things you need to know about Apple\u2019s new iPhone and iPad software</strong></a><br></li> </ul>",
  "<p><em>Earlier this week members of the Syrian Arab Red Crescent (SARC) group were among those killed during an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/19/syria-ceasefire-is-over-says-countrys-military\">attack on a convoy</a> bringing relief to the city of Aleppo. Here we look at the critical work the organisation\u2019s volunteers do every single day.</em></p> <p>Aleppo and its surrounding area has seen much of the fighting in Syria over the past five years. For the Aleppo branch of SARC, run mostly by young volunteers who have given up other careers to do this work, the demands have grown from health and food parcels to pest control, mending water pumps, and running projects for street children. SARC is non political and is one of the only agencies able to cross the conflict\u2019s front lines.</p> <h2>\u2018Never have I seen children so motivated to learn\u2019</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6d7754c7fe30b1f6a283a56903aed7f293ac6b9f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6d7754c7fe30b1f6a283a56903aed7f293ac6b9f/0_145_2272_1363/1000.jpg\" alt=\"undefined\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Around 60 children live in shelters with their families in the rural area of Al-Majbal after fleeing Aleppo. In a makeshift tent, volunteers from SARC\u2019s psychosocial support team provide activities for the children. Most have not been able to go to school in some time, if at all. \u201cNever ever I have seen children so motivated to learn as these,\u201d says Qamar, a volunteer who is teaching basic numeracy and literacy. </p> <h2>Alone, homeless and begging to survive </h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"57287908a4dfc64b150da53cc150ad29ac0c177d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/57287908a4dfc64b150da53cc150ad29ac0c177d/0_29_3456_2074/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A volunteer helps a child write her name\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>One of the most devastating impacts of the conflict has been on children who have been left homeless, alone and begging on the street in order to survive. Here, Mirna, who is 13, learns to write her name at a SARC project for street children in Aleppo, which provides welfare and support to 75 children. Abed, the SARC volunteer says: \u201cThis project has made a great impression on Mirna and other children, as they have been able to integrate well into their communities. Mirna is more confident and she likes to write her name everywhere. It is a fabulous feeling for her.\u201d</p> <h2>Displaced for the third time in two years</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"16254147ee7fb0bad2caa4ede3067ff9a7ffd90b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/16254147ee7fb0bad2caa4ede3067ff9a7ffd90b/0_0_4928_2957/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A boy is helped to walk to a mobile clinic by his mother and brother\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Radwan (centre) is helped to a SARC mobile clinic by his mother and brother to have his bandage changed, a daily task for the medical team. The family recently fled fighting in Aleppo, becoming displaced for the third time in the two years since Radwan\u2019s father died. Along with several other families, they now live in a public park. Radwan is keen to recover as soon as possible to join his older brother, aged 13, at work to support the family.</p> <h2>For refugees, finding safety often comes before medical needs</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"17cb3230051bb95a2fcc10ab350a7b9c849654fc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/17cb3230051bb95a2fcc10ab350a7b9c849654fc/0_307_4928_2957/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A volunteer doctor listens to a refugee woman's heartbeat\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Mrs Amina, 48, receives a health check at a collective shelter. She has been displaced twice, and struggles with several health issues including cardiovascular disease, hypertension, and chronic back pain. She is also the sole carer for eight children. </p> <p>Many thousands of displaced people within Syria are struggling with existing health conditions. The drive to find safety comes first, and medical needs are often neglected by parents desperate to settle their children in a new location. A mobile health team from SARC has been able to provide Mrs Amina with the necessary medications at her new shelter in a public park. During August the Aleppo teams treated 1,659 patients across the region. </p> <h2>Improving conditions in camps</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"c8794a5ba83b66ccc679db1073ae329c23c1421b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c8794a5ba83b66ccc679db1073ae329c23c1421b/0_302_4928_2957/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A child picks up mosquito nets for her family\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Aicha, nine, collects mosquito nets from SARC. Before the conflict, many areas of Syria were regularly sprayed with mosquito repellent as a public health measure, but now there is a high risk of contracting mosquito and insect-borne diseases. All 14 members of Aicha\u2019s family live in the courtyard of a mosque in southern Aleppo, which lacks adequate sanitation and supplies. Dozens of other families also live there. A team of volunteers visits regularly to try to improve conditions and carries out pest control and rubbish collection in many other areas. </p> <h2>Going to where the people are</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"eedfac39bbd8361846c70278830c4c53e5489e05\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/eedfac39bbd8361846c70278830c4c53e5489e05/0_0_4928_2957/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Volunteers check over an injured boy\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>This mobile health team visits shelters, public parks, empty schools and mosques \u2013 everywhere that refugees are living. Nour, nine, is checked over after reporting fever, pain and discharge after his wounds became infected. The family witnessed escalating violence in their neighbourhood, leaving both Nour and his father injured. His father could no longer work following his injuries, and the family now live in a collective shelter in the Al-Shafy mosque. \u201cThe boy\u2019s health situation is advancing well\u201d says Abdul Hamid from the SARC team. \u201cIn time, he will be able to join in with the football games.\u201d </p> <h2>\u2018We left everything behind us, we had no other choice\u2019 </h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"680fd83f7dd64f9aa18a75d0382f5105efa89271\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/680fd83f7dd64f9aa18a75d0382f5105efa89271/0_0_4928_2957/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A volunteer takes down details from a displaced woman\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>A health volunteer takes down details from a displaced woman. Mrs Fatoum, 62, is suffering from hypertension, hyperthyroidism and complications from a previous leg injury. \u201cI was forced to leave my home, I fled with family as soon as the clashes went very close to the house.

  "<p>Christine Johnson and her husband David have been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/fostering\">fostering</a> for 17 years, and have looked after more than 140 children, mostly teenagers with severe behavioural and mental health issues. Most did not attend school or college, or work. But in April 2016, the pay they received for caring for these troubled young people was slashed by a third, after Solihull council introduced a new fee structure.</p> <p>Previously, the couple received \u00a3169 a week in basic fees for each child they fostered. This was topped up by an additional \u00a356 each during placements, because they both possess NVQ level 3 qualifications. But Johnson says that under the new fee scheme, their extra payments were scrapped and they were only given a total of \u00a3186 a week per placement, because they were deemed not to have done enough to support and develop the fostering service. \u201cWe protested, pointing out the fact that we already represented enormous value for money, taking into account all that we do and cope with 24/7, but it was to no avail. We are among the most experienced and qualified foster carers in the area, but we were not being valued as such,\u201d says Johnson who is one of just under 45,000 foster families in England.</p> <p>A number of councils have also reduced fees, while others have cut training budgets and some allowances. In Bradford, changes introduced last year mean that if foster families go more than six weeks without a placement, their retainer fee is halved \u2013 and scrapped altogether after 12 weeks.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/feb/12/our-lives-in-foster-care-what-it-feels-like-to-be-given-a-new-family\">Our lives in foster care: what it feels like to be given a new family</a> </p> </aside>  <p>This might seem sensible, but Nathan Williams, an experienced foster carer, points out that \u201ccarers do not allocate the children, so [cutting these retainer fees means] there is an incentive to take any child regardless of whether they would fit in with your family\u201d. In addition, foster carers in the city can no longer specialise in a particular age group. \u201cThey make families take children from 0-18, regardless of our wishes,\u201d he says. Holiday allowances that used to pay \u00a310 per child per day have also been scrapped. \u201cThis is even though I earn around \u00a32 an hour for looking after a child 24/7. New carers fare worse with just \u00a31.50 being paid for the same level of care.\u201d</p> <p>But unlike caring professions such as nursing, foster carers can\u2019t challenge decisions to cut fees or change working conditions because they have no employment status. \u201cWe see foster carers as part of the workforce,\u201d says Kevin Williams, chief executive of the Fostering Network charity. \u201cThey are self-employed, but by statute can only work for one provider. It\u2019s not a normal employment situation.\u201d</p> <p>When Johnson heard about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2016/jul/30/job-pay-workers-gig-economy\">bicycle couriers fighting</a> to get proper pay and employment status, it struck a chord. \u201cFoster carers too are told that we are self-employed, but while we have all of the disadvantages that go with this status: no sick pay, no holiday pay and no pension rights, we have none of the usual advantages,\u201d she says. \u201cWe can\u2019t offer our services where we might see fit to. Instead, we\u2019re tied to one local authority or independent fostering agency.\u201d She got in touch with the Independent Workers\u2019 Union of Great Britain (IWGB), which successfully fought to get bicycle couriers working for City Sprint, eCourier and Mach1 higher pay. The couriers are still fighting for employment rights, such as entitlement to the minimum wage and holiday pay.</p> <p>Johnson is not alone in feeling isolated and angry. On Monday, at a meeting in parliament supported by the shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, around 60 foster carers voted to unionise and join the IWGB in a bid to improve their working conditions. \u201cFoster carer workers have shown that enough is enough,\u201d says the IWGB general secretary, Jason Moyer-Lee. \u201cThey take care of some of the most vulnerable people in society. The terms and conditions and pay they receive should reflect the importance of the work they do, and the IWGB will support them in their quest for better rights.\u201d</p> <p>Meanwhile, nearly 500 foster carers in Yorkshire and north Derbyshire are members of the GMB union, which is also campaigning in Manchester, Stockport and Torbay. In addition to anger over cuts, foster carers are increasingly fed up at their precarious legal status. Many feel that any attempt to challenge a decision or make a complaint will be ignored and could lead to them being deregistered by the local authority because they are not protected by whistleblowing legislation.</p> <p>In Norfolk, the Norfolk Foster Care Association is taking legal action against the county council on behalf of its members. \u201cIt\u2019s absolutely outrageous, the way foster carers are treated,\u201d says Raymond Bewry, chair of the Norfolk Foster Carers\u2019 Association. \u201cChildren are being routinely removed from foster homes without due process. We\u2019re talking child protection here.\u201d</p> <p>Foster carers are rarely, if ever, informed about why a child is removed from their care and it can happen out of the blue, says Diego Soto-Miranda, a barrister who has been instructed in a number of high court cases brought by foster carers, including the Norfolk case. \u201cNo explanations are given. The council then subjects the foster carer to another \u2018official\u2019 review whereby the council carries out, in effect, a secret trial known as a \u201cLado\u201d. The foster carer cannot be accompanied by a legal representative, to speak up for him or her, and is not allowed to see any evidence presented at that hearing. The foster carer can then be deregistered and banned from working with children or vulnerable people again. It ruins their lives.\u201d</p> <p>And because they have no employment rights, they cannot claim unfair dismissal, Soto-Miranda adds. He has successfully brought a number of cases under human rights law, arguing that foster carers have a right to a fair process. That means having the right to put your case forward. \u201cYou can\u2019t answer any allegations if you don\u2019t know what\u2019s been alleged and by whom,\u201d he says. He also successfully argued that foster carers have a right under human rights law to a private family life, an effective remedy and to protect their reputation. \u201cSuddenly, removing a child breaches their right to those fundamental rights.\u201d</p> <p>This lack of protection has so alarmed local MP Norman Lamb that he has written this week to Edward Timpson, the children\u2019s minister, to request a meeting. \u201cThe current legal position leaves foster carers highly vulnerable and therefore there is little doubt in my mind that children are put at risk because of fear of the consequences of speaking out,\u201d the letter states.</p> <p>Lamb explains on the phone: \u201cIf there\u2019s anything that stands in the way of foster carers raising concerns, that is wrong and we have to address it. They have absolutely no protection. It\u2019s a child protection issue.\u201d</p> <p>The Department for Education says it takes whistleblowing very seriously. \u201cFostering services must have procedures in place for handling complaints and responding to whistleblowers\u2019 concerns,\u201d a spokeswoman says. \u201cWe are launching the National Fostering Stocktake \u2013 a fundamental review of fostering across the country \u2013 which will look at the issues affecting foster carers, including accountability and complaints.\u201d</p> <p>Lamb favours amending the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_Interest_Disclosure_Act_1998\">Public Interest Disclosure Act</a> so that foster carers who blow the whistle are protected. But the DfE says that as they are not employed, it does not consider the whistleblowing legislation to be a \u201csuitable vehicle\u201d for foster carers to resolve their complaints.</p> <p>Solihull, Bradford and Norfolk councils all have whistleblowing policies. A spokeswoman for Norfolk county council says: \u201cWe would entirely dispute the claim that children in Norfolk are removed from foster carers without due process \u2013 this happens extremely rarely and only when the safety of the child is in question. There have been no cases where this has happened in the last year.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2016/jul/30/job-pay-workers-gig-economy\">\u2018Love the job, hate the way we\u2019re treated\u2019: life on the frontline of UK\u2019s delivery army</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Ken Meeson, cabinet member for children\u2019s services at Solihull council, says: \u201cMost carers were not affected or were slightly better off under the revised scheme. A small number would receive less payment; however, there are options to increase this, through offering greater flexibility, providing more placements, or demonstrating skills that qualify for a higher fee.\u201d</p> <p>A spokeswoman for Bradford council says: \u201cBradford council puts the child\u2019s needs at the centre of these decisions and would certainly not be interested in putting a child in a family that would not want them there.

She was missing but nobody knew that she was dead. </p> <p>The taxi driver was jailed for life over O\u2019Callaghan\u2019s murder in 2012 but initially evaded prosecution for murdering Godden because the evidence obtained by Fulcher was ruled inadmissible in court. <a href=\"http:// https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/sep/19/chris-halliwell-becky-godden-killer-police-justice-steve-fulcher  \">Finally this week a jury found Halliwell guilty of Godden\u2019s murder after a new team uncovered fresh evidence.</a> </p> <h2><strong>Here Fulcher explains in his own words why he acted as he did</strong></h2> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I am very pleased that Karen Edwards has finally seen justice done for her beautiful daughter Becky, who was brutally murdered by Christopher Halliwell.

I thank Karen for her resilience and determination to obtain justice for her beloved daughter.</p> <p>Halliwell is an evil and depraved violator of women. I did all I could to find an abducted girl, Sian O\u2019Callaghan, in an effort to save her life; the first duty of a police officer.</p> <p>I also recovered a second victim of Halliwell\u2019s murder: Becky, returning her to her loved ones after eight years of their misery. I caught a serial killer, preventing any further girls being murdered.</p> <p>I adhered to the ACPO kidnap principles. Halliwell had to be arrested as he was about to commit suicide. As the law stands, the expectation was that I should have prioritised Halliwell\u2019s right to silence and legal protection over Sian O\u2019Callaghan\u2019s right to life. </p> <p>I remain convinced that the action that I took in allowing Halliwell to take me to the bodies of both Sian and Becky, was the right and moral thing to do.

The public will need to know how this can be, and what the police will do on behalf of their loved ones who are missing (over 300,000 missing people are reported to the police each year). When the extraordinary facts of this case are explained it is likely to lead to a public crisis of confidence in the competence and credibility of the police service.</p> <p>Despite everything that has happened to me, I cannot regret the decisions that I took that day. Ultimately, that decision ensured the return of two beautiful young women, which bought comfort to their families and ensured that Halliwell has been duly convicted of both murders. </p> <p>Now the trial is over and I am no longer a serving police officer, I am able to put these issues into the public domain for the first time.

  "<p>Spanish police are investigating an attack on a herd of recently reintroduced European bison that left one animal decapitated, three missing and several more apparently poisoned.<br></p> <p>Officers were called to the <a href=\"http://www.reservavaldeserrillas.com/\">Valdeserrillas reserve</a> in Valencia on Friday after the discovery of the headless body of Sauron, the dominant male of a small herd of bison that had been brought to eastern Spain over the past year. <br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/may/21/-sp-european-bison-europe-romania-carpathian-mountains\">Return of the European bison</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Staff and police said they believed the herd was poisoned so that their heads could be cut off and sold as trophies.</p> <p>Carlos \u00c1lamo, the manager of the reserve, said he noticed something was wrong when he went to check on the animals last Wednesday.

A number of them will do that until all the bees are dead, and then go in and take their honey.\u201d<br></p> <p>Tim Lovett, director of public affairs at the BBKA, said the sighting was \u201cnot good news for honeybees\u201d, adding: \u201cWhat happens next in terms of containment measures will be vital and we look to Defra to implement the contingency plans to deal with this invasion of a non-native species.\u201d</p> <p>Defra\u2019s science wing, Fera, says that the primary effect of the hornet\u2019s predation is the death of adult worker honeybees, warning that \u201cjust a handful of hornets can destroy an entire \u2026 nest in a couple of hours\u201d. While certain honeybees have defence strategies to reduce damage, including forming a mass of bees around the hornet, raising the temperature to a lethal 45C, Fera says the European honeybee is less effective at this \u201cheat-balling\u201d.</p> <p>In terms of the risk to humans, Shardlow said: \u201cThis is a fairly big wasp. Generally the bigger they are, the less aggressive they are. There are no bigger threat to humans than the wasps we already have.\u201d<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>One live hornet and one dead one were spotted by government experts but as yet no nests. The National Bee Unit in North Yorkshire is conducting DNA tests on the dead hornet in an attempt to discover how it arrived in the UK.

Burney is in Whitton, a quaint rural town on her traditional Wiradjuri country in a region more recently known as the Riverina. A visibly nervous Bolt, of Dutch descent, is driving north from Melbourne to meet her. Their partnership commences with Bolt interrogating Burney about why she identifies so strongly with her Aboriginal ancestry when she is also of Scottish heritage. For him, it seems, identity is not innate but a choice. </p> <p>It\u2019s the first of numerous bewildering, frustrating moments for Bolt, as he struggles to comprehend Burney\u2019s complex response and why it is that he might be considered a racist: \u201cThere wouldn\u2019t be many Australians more against racism than me,\u201d he says to camera at one point.</p> <p>For clarity, Burney takes him to Redfern, an inner-city suburb in Sydney. They meet the Indigenous political adviser Stan Grant, dressed too smartly to be working a double-end bag at Tony Mundine\u2019s famed boxing gym.

Sitting in a high office tower overlooking the Brisbane river, Bolt invites him to confirm his assertion that \u201con the ground there isn\u2019t this passion for it [recognition], in the Aboriginal communities\u201d. <br></p> <p>The irony persists with a visit to Arnhem Land in the Northern Territory, where Yolgnu educators Yalmay Yunupingu and Witiyana Marika try to impress upon Bolt the value of bilingual education to achieve better cognitive development in Aboriginal children. Again, it\u2019s lost on Bolt: he may now be more appreciative of the faith that the Yolgnu place in their culture but he too quickly reverts back to a monoculturalist, assimilationist perspective, asking: \u201cCan they speak English?\u201d </p> <p>Bolt\u2019s visit to the self-declared sovereign Yidindji Nation, to chat with the puckish former journalist Murrumu, goes pear-shaped. Bolt wants Burney to meet Murrumu, to smugly prove that constitutional recognition will lead to a treaty, which \u2013 he believes \u2013 will result in separatist, race-based Indigenous \u201cstates\u201d, like Yidindji. </p> <p>\u201cThis is the logical outcome,\u201d he tells her. But Murrumu, who has renounced his Australian citizenship, informs him: \u201cIt\u2019s not because we want to be separatist \u2013 far from it.\u201d<br></p> <p>After a hop across the ditch, the duo visit the former New Zealand National party prime minister Jim Bolger who, during his period of leadership in the 90s, oversaw the settlement of some longstanding disputes for breaches of the Treaty of Waitangi. </p> <p>Bolt expected his rejectionist position to be welcomed by the conservative former PM \u2013 but Bolger\u2019s advocacy for Indigenous self-determination and meaningful reconciliation sits in stark contrast to Bolt\u2019s views.</p> <p>\u201cWhy are you fearful of your history?\u201d Bolger asks him directly. He challenges Bolt\u2019s fear of separatist states as an \u201cexaggeration\u201d and proposes that people of substantial influence have a responsibility to remove \u2013 not play into \u2013 the alarm of a sceptical public.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b5672e8fdc064b20254c4b4509355774be8b4c4a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b5672e8fdc064b20254c4b4509355774be8b4c4a/0_0_5460_3810/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Andrew Bolt, Cory Bernardi and Linda Burney\" width=\"1000\" height=\"698\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018A quirky piece of theatre\u2019: Andrew Bolt, Cory Bernardi and Linda Burney discuss recognition over a plate of cakes.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mark Rogers/ABC</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>A return to Bolt\u2019s home town of Adelaide to visit hard-right conservative Cory Bernardi is a quirky piece of theatre. Burney, Bernardi and Bolt sit around a plate of small cakes, a limp Australian flag framed prominently behind them. </p> <p>Bernardi launches into a defence of the constitution, based on the logic that it has enabled the likes of Burney to obtain her seat in parliament. Burney deftly reminds him that her seat only came thanks to constitutional reform \u2013 the referendum of 1967, when Australians voted to count Indigenous people as part of the population. Bernardi and Bolt are left stammering.<br></p> <p>The caper continues when he tells Shireen Morris, policy adviser for the Cape York Institute, that he is Indigenous. It\u2019s a rib-tickling routine from Bolt. Morris details the three-part legal definition for identifying as Indigenous to prove that he is incorrect. But identity politics are little more than a parlour game to Bolt: \u201cI\u2019m changing the definition,\u201d he says, casually dismissing Morris\u2019 points of law.</p> <p>It all culminates with Burney and Bolt visiting the Royal Exhibition Building in Melbourne, site of the commonwealth\u2019s exclusive first sitting of parliament in 1901. Seated in the gallery overlooking the main floor, Bolt explains \u201cwe must find a common, overarching identity or set of values \u2026 There is no first Australians, and second Australians, and third or fourth, and all that\u201d. He passionately describes his bond with Australia \u201cequal in depth of emotion\u201d, he says, to any felt by Burney or other Indigenous Australians.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not a competition,\u201d Burney replies. </p> <p>\u201cThen drop the word \u2018first\u2019,\u201d he says.</p> <p>\u201cI can\u2019t drop the word \u2018first\u2019.\u201d </p> <p>\u201cThen it\u2019s a competition.\u201d </p> <p>The frustrating conversation is analogous to the program as a whole: light on genuine substance and fitful with gauche polemic, resembling something akin to a quasi-intellectual bout of foosball. It\u2019s typical ABC fare: a beige primer of \u201che said, she said\u201d that makes no firm ground in any direction. Brief contextual backgrounders use euphemisms including \u201csettler\u201d to avoid being contentious \u2013 while Burney strains to emphasise the importance of the actual truth in remedying the ills of more than 200 years of colonialism. </p>",
  "<p>Today\u2019s recipe is a door-stopper. Not in the sense of keeping the door open \u2013 although it is probably heavy enough. A door-stopper in that it may make people stop, for a moment, at your door. A least, that\u2019s what happened to mine yesterday.</p> <p>Our whole building \u2013 seven floors, each with three flats \u2013 had new meters attached to the radiators before they clonk back into action next month. An efficient team of fitters took over the building and the lift, moving in and out of the flats so often that most of us got the message and left our front doors open. For a morning, the building reminded me of Sicily this summer, doors open allowing glimpses of life inside: a stove, a pair of legs, a bike, a sense of neatness, or a sense of chaos (in our case the latter). <br></p> <p>Then, by midday, there were cooking smells, toast, bacon in a hot pan, something with Indian spices, and also my baked vegetable dish, which fills the kitchen with a blast that sums up this time of year \u2013 the last gasps of summer, the first slow autumn cooking. All the fitters stopped at the door and nodded, one wafting his hand to his nose as if to say: \u201cNot bad.\u201d</p> <p>This dish is from Greek Food by <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/recipes-from-my-greek-kitchen.html\">Rena Salaman</a>, a book of my mum\u2019s I have had my eye on for years. I didn\u2019t intend it to find its way into my suitcase, but it did, and now it alternates between my bedside and the kitchen. The subtitle is \u201can affectionate celebration of traditional recipes\u201d, which is exactly what it is; it\u2019s also rich and evocative in a way few books are. Having just spent a long summer in Sicily, where no family recipes were written down, and \u2013 as my father-in-law puts it \u2013 the people who really knew have all died or gone quietly mad, this book provides missing pieces in a vast jigsaw. <br></p> <p>The similarities and connections between Greek and Sicilian food are many. There are differences too, but the similarities are much more interesting: ideas about hospitality and celebration; the triptych of olive oil, grapes and wheat; the unbridled use of lemons, sesame seeds and oregano; and an attachment to simple, seasonal, understated everyday food. This dish is typical. It is Greek, but also exactly like a Sicilian dish that Vincenzo ate as a boy. I think it would make itself at home anywhere, especially now, when we are all enjoying the summer\u2019s last sun-filled vegetables.</p> <p>This was a dish that was traditionally prepared at home and then taken to the local bakers to cook in the residual heat of the cooling bread ovens, a habit that ceased as people got ovens at home. When we were in Sicily, Vincenzo\u2019s uncle Liborio poked fun mercilessly at my idealism about the days of communal baking. He had plenty of stories of how nasty life could be: of burns, of mistaken dish identity, the walloping slap on the back of the head he got from his mum if he was late back.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/aug/04/fishermans-soup-recipe-tomato-and-oregano-fritters-crete-marianna-leivaditaki-cook-residency\">Three sun-drenched recipes inspired by Crete | Cook residency</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But the spirit of the dishes cooked in bread ovens persists when we make them at home; when we put disparate ingredients, seasoning and enough liquid together in one dish, then let time and heat work their alchemy.

  "<p>Little Sister, a story set in Amsterdam and the nearby seaside resort of Volendam, grew out of some very old memories, rather too close to the place that was once my home.</p> <p> Forty-six years ago, I abandoned school at the age of 17 to take up a five-pound-a-week cub reporter\u2019s job on the smallest evening newspaper in Britain. It was in the seaside town of Scarborough, then in its heyday as a brassy English bucket-and-spade resort. </p> <p> This was just before the masses decamped to Torremolinos. Scarborough was fashionable. The Beatles had played the Futurist theatre six years before \u2013 I got taken to see them as a treat for passing my 11-plus. The massive Victorian hulk of the Grand Hotel, once the biggest in Europe, loomed from the cliffs over the seafront, as much of a draw as it had been in Edwardian times when Scarborough touted itself as a Yorkshire version of Nice. In the busy theatres, the biggest TV acts in the country played summer shows alongside the Black and White Minstrels \u2013 a production few people remember these days, though back then Welshmen in blackface singing \u201cnegro spirituals\u201d was primetime TV.</p> <p> And the place was rotten, top to toe. In a spacious flat just across the Spa Bridge from the Grand lived Jimmy Savile with his mother, \u201cthe Duchess\u201d. Down below on the seafront, the \u201cice cream king\u201d Peter Jaconelli, a prominent local businessman newly elevated to town mayor, was a big mate of Savile\u2019s, someone with the same taste for sexual abuse. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2014/jun/26/jimmy-savile-sexual-abuse-timeline\">Jimmy Savile: timeline of his sexual abuse and its uncovering</a> </p> </aside>  <p> The squalid details of Savile and Jaconelli\u2019s predatory habits are now public knowledge. In 2014, North Yorkshire police <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2014/dec/18/jimmy-savile-victims-apology-police-north-yorkshire\">publicly apologised</a> to 35 victims of the pair, after admitting both men should have been liable to prosecution over charges of indecent assault, inciting a child to engage in sexual activity, gross indecency and rape.</p> <p>I read that story while I was in Amsterdam thinking about the background to the book I was about to write. That moment I had it. Because to pretty much anyone living in Scarborough back in the 1970s, the police\u2019s belated apology was old hat. I\u2019d met Jaconelli and Savile many times as a local reporter and heard all the rumours and the warnings to steer clear of any invitations they offered. We knew exactly what they were already. We just did nothing about it. </p> <p> The police were aware of what was going on from the very outset. Intelligence files that have come to light since Savile\u2019s death, <a href=\"http://nyenquirer.uk/savile-jaconelli-they-knew-in-72/\">mostly through the efforts of a brave campaigning website</a>, reveal that in 1972 Jaconelli was accused of indecent assault, only for the case to be dropped. All in secret of course. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Savile appeared a complex and frightening individual, charmless and vaguely threatening beneath the perma-smile</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p> But it\u2019s not enough to lay the blame at the door of the police alone. It was an open secret in the town at the time that Jaconelli assaulted boys in his ice-cream parlour when he had the opportunity, and that Savile, sometimes with Jaconelli alongside, liked to cruise around in his Rolls-Royce looking to pick up any gullible kids willing to ride with them. If they got awkward they were threatened or paid off. Scarborough, like most seaside resorts, had a ready underclass of youth looking for money. Most of the jobs were seasonal and tied to the holiday trade. Winter was long and cash was always scarce. They had plenty of places to hunt. </p> <p> Jaconelli, it seemed to me, was little more than a devious opportunist determined to work a system that gave him free rein to pursue his victims. Savile appeared an altogether more complex and frightening individual, charmless and vaguely threatening beneath the perma-smile, gold jewellery and stinking cigar. He was oddly obsessed with his mother, and a Catholic too, given a papal knighthood in 1990, even attending daily mass later in life. One can only wonder what the confessions were like. Did Savile see his devotion to his mother and his work for charity \u2013 which was very real \u2013 as ways of offsetting the evil? Or did he do good as a way to find new victims? We\u2019ll never know, and I wonder if the man understood himself.</p> <p> The crime in crime fiction is often banal and uninteresting \u2013 squalid, tawdry acts by squalid, tawdry people. \u201cWhy?\u201d is often a more intriguing question in fiction than \u201cwhat?\u201d The question that arose when I started writing Little Sister was the one that had puzzled me whenever I thought back to Scarborough: why did decent people stand back and do nothing?</p> <p> On one level we had no choice. I was 17, working for a newspaper that was part of the collective blindness. The title was then under private ownership, run by a terrifying individual who, among other things, chaired the local magistrates\u2019 court. I learned early on that, whatever its skills at reporting flower shows and those unfortunate enough to come before our owner in the courts, Watergate would never have been broken by the Scarborough Evening News. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/oct/20/jimmy-savile-controlling-people-and-his-myth-dan-davies-biography\">'Jimmy Savile was supremely controlling \u2013 of people and his myth'</a> </p> </aside>  <p> </p> <p> That was Scarborough back then. Today, the Futurist is a miserable closed wreck and the Grand Hotel, which once wouldn\u2019t let you through the door if you were wearing jeans, is a rather shabby \u00a329-a-night stop for budget coach parties. Like seaside resorts everywhere, Scarborough is struggling to survive in changed times, though it\u2019s still blessed with a gorgeous physical location, a handful of decent hotels, and <a href=\"http://lanterna-ristorante.co.uk/\">one of the best Italian restaurants in the land</a>.</p> <p>I love going back even if there are dark memories in those streets. We turned a blind eye, all of us. Out of fear, out of acceptance of our place, and probably out of some misguided belief that, however awful the gossip about this unsavoury pair might have been, surely it couldn\u2019t have been that bad. In truth it was all much worse than any of us might have imagined.</p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p> There are victims of Savile and Jaconelli still alive too, still angry, still in pain. Still, in some cases, blaming themselves, because victims of crimes like these are so often convinced that they brought their trauma on themselves. It\u2019s a cruel fact that shame and guilt haunt the innocent much more than they dog the guilty. All that talk about \u201cclosure\u201d is just that: talk. Damage and hurt last a lifetime and can, on occasion, mutate into evil itself.</p> <p> These were the ideas I wanted to explore in Little Sister, the story of two young sisters who might be victims or perpetrators, perhaps even both, and are unsure of which themselves. </p> <p> It\u2019s all fiction, though it happens in another brassy seaside town, just 13 miles outside Amsterdam. But its roots lie on the Yorkshire coast 40 years ago and still resonate there to this day.</p> <h2>Extract</h2> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>People on the island village understood there was some kind of psychiatric institution on their doorstep. Only the few who worked there knew it housed a handful of the most disturbed female juvenile criminals in the Netherlands. The positioning was deliberate. On one side was the Gouwzee lake stretching west to Waterland and the main road to Amsterdam. On the other the larger Markermeer, part of a vast expanse of inland water that ran all the way out to the North Sea.</p> <p> Nothing but a grassy dyke joined Marken to the outside world, a narrow lane above it. Any inmate who escaped would have to make their way along that. None had tried in the 18 years of its existence. Nor did many visitors come the other way. Certainly not for Mia and Kim Timmers, two orphaned sisters forgotten for the most part, out of convenience and an unspoken sense of communal guilt.</p> <p> They\u2019d been there since they were 11 years old and detained for killing a man.

He said his firearms collection began to grow after he became a father. He had a \u201ccatastrophic knee injury\u201d that he worried would make it hard for him to protect his wife and child, and when he researched his neighborhood, he saw crime was going up. </p> <p>\u201cI want everyone in my home to be able to defend themselves at a moment\u2019s notice if a violent criminal decides he wants to break down the door,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Fred said his wife usually carried a gun in her purse or on her person, and his 70-year-old mother, who sings in the church choir, had become such a gun enthusiast that he got her a laser sight for her gun for Christmas. </p> <p>He keeps guns stored in the living room; in his bedroom, on both his side and his wife\u2019s side of the bed; and in his garage workshop.</p> <p>\u201cIf I\u2019m working in my garage and someone wanders in and he wants rob me, I can\u2019t say: \u2018Can you hang on for a second?\u2019\u201d </p> <p>Fred couldn\u2019t know where he might be \u201cwhen the worst day in my life arrives\u201d, he said. \u201cIf I\u2019m going to believe that I\u2019m prepared, I better be prepared.\u201d </p> <p>It\u2019s not just a home intruder that worries him, but a broader societal breakdown. He spent five years as a civilian truck driver during the Iraq war making deliveries between military bases in southern Iraq. Today, he sees the fragility of America\u2019s food supply network. If the interstate highways aren\u2019t drivable, or if the electrical grid fails and diesel stations can\u2019t pump their fuel, many local stores would quickly run out of food, he said. </p> <p>\u201cAll of our morals or ethics would be out the window in the fear of the inability to survive as soon we got just a little bit hungry.\u201d</p> <p>His collection includes five AR-15s for self-protection, and rifles and shotguns for hunting small, medium, and large game, since a rifle that\u2019s good for hunting deer \u201cwould just obliterate\u201d a rabbit. </p> <p>But the benefit of his gun collection isn\u2019t just the security. It\u2019s the joy of being able to constantly tinker with his guns, personalizing and improving them. He bought one rifle for $700 and then spent more than $1,500 customizing it. </p> <p>\u201cSome of them were just pretty,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of like man jewelry, for lack of anything better to call it. </p> <p>\u201cIn Florida, we cannot open carry unless we\u2019re on personal property or our own business, so these things are never really going to be seen by the general public,\u201d he said. But he likes knowing that there\u2019s something fully custom-made for him, in a custom-designed holster, on his hip. \u201cIt kind of makes me giggle. It\u2019s not different than a woman who would have a very very nice tennis bracelet that she wouldn\u2019t dream of wearing out just to go to dinner and catch a movie, but when you open up the jewelry box, it\u2019s there.\u201d </p> <h2>\u2018I\u2019m just an accumulator\u2019</h2> <p>Compared with gun owners overall, people who own more than eight guns are more likely to be men, less likely to be black or Hispanic, and more likely to own a gun for protection, said Deborah Azrael, a Harvard School of Public Health firearms researcher and the lead author of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/19/us-gun-ownership-survey\">new survey of gun ownership</a>. </p> <p>But American women are firearms super-owners, too. Patti Bonnie, 45, a military veteran and small-business owner in Florida, used to own just a single handgun and a shotgun. Then, in May 2014, she used one of her guns to deter an attempted home invasion \u2013 simply by raising the shotgun and moving toward the intruder, she said. Today, she owns an estimated 25 to 30 guns. </p> <p>\u201cYou know, it\u2019s kind of like tattoos,\u201d she said. \u201cYou can\u2019t have just one.\u201d </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cde588337b2a88eced927badf4fafa0ecce5809c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cde588337b2a88eced927badf4fafa0ecce5809c/0_155_5336_3203/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A handgun is concealed in a couch for home defense.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">One collector\u2019s handgun is concealed in a couch for home defense.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andrew Stanfill/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Vicki, a firearms instructor who lives in a western state, said she and her husband own about 20 guns for their personal use, as well as an additional 20 guns \u2013 a set of four guns each in five different calibers \u2013 that she uses to introduce women to shooting. </p> <p>\u201cAll of our guns have a purpose,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m not about pretty guns.\u201d </p> <p>Even among friends, gun owners didn\u2019t tend to boast about the number of guns they had, Phil Schreier, a senior curator at the National Rifle Association\u2019s National Firearms Museum, said.<br></p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve been pleasantly surprised by the number of guns a lot of my friends have owned,\u201d Schreier said. </p> <p>Gun collections are valuable and are viewed by many people as a financial investment, he said. A well-chosen gun collection might grow in value like a 401k. </p> <p>Though gun collecting has been around since the dawn of firearms in the 1400s and 1500s \u2013 Henry VIII was an early collector, as were Thomas Jefferson and George Washington \u2013 in the United States, gun collecting started to take off around the 1930s, as more Americans began to have the kind of disposable income that allowed them to buy for pleasure, not just for immediate need. </p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s hard to get somebody to identify themselves as a collector,\u201d Schreier said. \u201cNine out of 10 of them, you\u2019ll say, \u2018You\u2019 re a gun collector,\u2019 they\u2019ll go, \u2018Nah, I\u2019m just an accumulator.\u201d</p> <p>The United States does have serious community of firearms collectors. The NRA sponsors an annual gun collectors\u2019 show with more than $10,000 in prizes for the best collections. There are more than 120 gun collectors\u2019 clubs across the United States. </p> <p>Among the serious gun collectors is Robert, from central Florida, who has a collection of American military firearms that has been featured in several firearms television programs. </p> <p>The collection of roughly 100 firearms includes weapons used in the revolutionary war through the modern day, including a \u201cnear-complete collection of small arms from world war two and Vietnam\u201d.</p> <p>Among the firearms he owns are several fully automatic weapons, including a Thompson submachine gun, or Tommy gun, and a Model 50 Reising submachine gun. These are prized collectors\u2019 items in the US, where ownership of these guns has been strictly regulated, tracked and limited. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"11723dc7c324b6c9a7bf352d3154081a621c97ae\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/11723dc7c324b6c9a7bf352d3154081a621c97ae/0_190_5712_3427/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Robert, an avid gun collector who lives in Florida, poses for a portrait while sitting at a bunk in the room he dedicated for his collection, Wednesday, August 17, 2016.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Robert poses for a portrait while sitting at a bunk in the room he has dedicated to his collection.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Douglas Bovitt/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Robert meets friends at a range weekly to fire some of his historic guns. \u201cI probably have less than 10 that I would not fire,\u201d he said, though ammunition for some of the more exotic guns is expensive enough to make firing them a rare treat. With the Thompson submachine gun, he said, \u201cyou can easily go through $100 worth of ammunition in one shooting session\u201d.</p> <p>For Americans concerned about about a potential government breakdown, though, it\u2019s more commonly available guns that often have the most potential value. </p> <p>\u201cIf I had to pick a number to survive a collapse, I think every person in your family or group should have a personal handgun and a personal carbine. That\u2019s a bare minimum,\u201d said Bryce Towsley, the author of Prepper Guns, who gave away copies of his book at this year\u2019s National Rifle Association convention. He added: \u201cYou should have a couple of backups,\u201d and recommended guns that use the most common forms of ammunition \u2013 perhaps 9mm for handguns and .223 for rifles.</p> <p>\u201cI know there are preppers out there who are buying guns and ammunition with the anticipation that\u2019s bartering material, and I don\u2019t think they\u2019ll be wrong.\u201d</p> <p>But Towsley, though he believes in preparing in case of disaster, is optimistic that in the United States government, \u201cgrown-ups take over and get us back on track\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cI hope it never happens,\u201d he said. \u201cMy worst nightmare is having to shoot anybody in defense of myself or my family.\u201d </p> <p>Towsley lives in a Vermont home overflowing with books, which he also collects avidly, and his own gun collection includes a selection of guns for the hunting trips he takes around the world, as well as for competitive shooting events.</p> <p>He said he is weary of gun owners being demonized and held up as a threat by Hillary Clinton and other politicians. </p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m what used to be considered a Joe Average American,\u201d Towsley said. \u201cI\u2019m a little conservative in my politics.

All the more so because it reflects a similar hardening of attitudes towards refugees evident here in Australia.</p> <p>On a recent flight from Dubai to Adelaide my wife Julie and I encountered Syrian refugees bound for re-settlement in South Australia.

But, much more than this, they were relieved to be escaping the holocaust in their homeland.</p> <p>I hope that promise of a new life is fulfilled. The odds are very much with them that it will. But it won\u2019t be completely plain sailing for them here in terms of acceptance by any means.</p> <p>They are starting out on a new life in a nervous society where buses for the first time ask passengers to be wary of unattended luggage, where government warnings encourage us to report anything that \u201cdoesn\u2019t look right\u201d, where an innocent question from a Syrian refugee to a policeman can be enough for that refugee to have his details written down as a routine security precaution, where our cyberspace is full of the most puerile anti-Muslim, anti-immigrant nonsense, where far rightists on immigration have just had marked success in our recent national election, and where a barbaric refugee policy still has strong public support.</p> <p>Let\u2019s hope we can buck our own version of the far-rightist trend you identify for Europe.

I totally agree that \u201cthe so-called Franco-German engine ... is broken \u2013 mainly because of France\u2019s economic weaknesses\u201d. Germany, for all its talk of upholding the rules, breaks year after year the rules on trade surpluses. It is projected to reach this year alone up to 8.9% of GDP. Anything above 6% is in violation of EU rules.</p> <p>Where are the politicians and journalists to shine the brightest light on this destruction of other nations\u2019 economies? Is it a wonder that the French voters turn to the Front National if, on their backs, Germany exports its unemployment?

Like it or not, the Brexit decision pinpoints wide disillusionment in the UK with the apparent evolution of the EU into an unwitting instrument of the uneven distribution of power and wealth.</p> <p>The imminent withdrawal of Britain may have an even greater impact on the EU. It must contribute to the growing dissent among EU members suffering the dual impacts of austerity and the influx of refugees.</p> <p>That the European experiment is still worth pursuing goes without saying. In our current geopolitical context, even major economies such as Germany stand little chance on their own of competing with the superpowers, China and America. It is ironic that the success of this attempt to create unity from recent disharmony now rests on whether Germany, under Angela Merkel, maintains effective leadership, or whether the various rightwing groups typified by Marine Le Pen gain effective control.</p> <p>Should the rightwing movements gain power, the future for a united Europe looks bleak indeed.

So you had enough control to be able to do the overdub. But you basically had one pass at putting on the extra stuff. It never stressed me because the whole thing about those songs was that the early songs we were already playing, and some of the later ones were freshly recorded, so we were used to playing them.

The relatively limited powers of his office, compared to his peers in New York or Paris. The shortage of brownfield, distrust of high-rise and complete absence of political appetite to extend London\u2019s boundaries, which, combined, mean a crippling lack of land to build on.</p> <p>But perhaps the biggest challenge facing Khan is the sheer scale of the problem. London\u2019s population is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2015/jan/09/london-booming-population-growth-success-challenges\">growing by roughly 100,000</a> a year. In his four years as mayor, London will grow by approximately the size of Bristol. Short of knocking down whole districts of the capital and rebuilding them, higher, it\u2019s not clear how anyone can solve this problem.</p> <p>Contrast this with much of the rest of the country. It\u2019s not quite true to say that the housing crisis is a London-specific phenomenon: a recent <a href=\"http://www.resolutionfoundation.org/media/press-releases/home-ownership-struggle-hits-coronation-street/\">Resolution Foundation report</a> showed that home ownership rates were in freefall all over the country, with the biggest drop of all in Greater Manchester.</p> <p>But the crisis in the north is as much about the quality and type of housing on offer as it is a simple matter of supply. Many northern cities are barely growing at all. Liverpool, indeed, is still 10% smaller than it was in 1981.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/08/sadiq-khan-labour-london-mayor\">Sadiq Khan could teach Labour how a leftwing underdog can win | Dave Hill</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The explanation for this is the same as the explanation of London\u2019s boom: people follow jobs, and the best-paid jobs are overwhelmingly located in the capital and its satellites. The current situation is nothing short of an internal brain drain: the north of England has some of the best universities in the world, yet their graduates have an awkward habit of fleeing the region after graduation. In other words, London\u2019s housing crisis, and the north\u2019s economic crisis, are two sides of the same coin. In one half of the country we don\u2019t have enough homes; in the other, we don\u2019t have enough jobs.</p> <p>It doesn\u2019t feel like it should be beyond the wit of man to come up with a policy that solves both these problems.</p> <p>What would such a policy look like? It wouldn\u2019t just let the market take its course (we\u2019ve tried that; it didn\u2019t work). Nor would it assume that simply throwing money at city-centre regeneration schemes would be enough to encourage private investment (that didn\u2019t work either).

By doing so, we could relieve pressure on the capital\u2019s scarce housing stock, by opening up a whole swath of central London to redevelopment; while simultaneously giving a massive boost to the economy of, say, Bradford, by giving ambitious graduates an incentive to move there.</p> <p>At some point soon, parliament will have to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/08/mps-must-leave-houses-of-parliament-4bn-repairs\">move out of the Palace of Westminster</a> before the place starts falling down.

So maybe Fellaini\u2019s remarks ought to be paraphrased: a club like Sir Alex Ferguson\u2019s Manchester United should not lose three games when the team are managed by Jos\u00e9 Mourinho.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/sep/19/jose-mourinho-manchester-united-five-things-wayne-rooney-paul-pogba\">Five things Jos\u00e9 Mourinho must do to stop the rot at Manchester United | Jamie Jackson</a> </p> </aside>  <p>This is the first time Mourinho has lost three consecutive games in a season since he was fresh in the door at Porto in 2002. And two of those defeats came in the Champions League at the hands of Real Madrid. It is also the worst league start in the Portuguese\u2019s all-conquering career since he first made his bow as manager, at Uni\u00e3o de Leiria in 2001, and even then his first five matches served up only a solitary defeat.</p> <p>The Special One has earned a reputation in this country, among many other things, as being a manager who hits the ground running, inspiring immediate faith and fire in his teams. This legend was forged in his first stint at Chelsea, where he won four of his first five games in the 2004-05 season, starting with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2004/aug/15/newsstory.chelsea1\">a 1-0 win against Ferguson\u2019s United</a>. It set a tone that took Chelsea to their first title in 50 years.</p> <p>Looking back on Mourinho\u2019s past achievements and the almost endless commentary he provided on them is interesting because the tropes that define his success have always been clearly articulated. After defeating United in August 2004 he happily admitted that his side had played with a defensive mentality, even though they were at home. \u201cIf you have to play a little bit different to win a game then you have to do it,\u201d he said. In further remarks he stressed the team\u2019s unity and concentration, comparing it favourably with his rivals with \u201cgreat teams [who] have worked with their managers for a long time\u201d.</p> <p>Just as visible in the rearview mirror are Mourinho\u2019s flaws, however, particularly his penchant for personal attacks. It was Luke Shaw\u2019s turn to feel the wrath of his manager at the weekend; the full-back, only recently returned from long-term injury, was accused of lacking the necessary \u201ctactical and mental\u201d strength to compete. In August 2004 it was United\u2019s Mika\u00ebl Silvestre who got it in the neck. The United defender had suggested Chelsea might struggle to gel immediately under their new manager. Mourinho made sure to issue a response. \u201cWhen Silvestre said we haven\u2019t got the time to create a big team spirit he was wrong,\u201d he said.</p> <p>On arrival in Italy as manager of Internazionale in 2008, Mourinho won three of his first five matches. He lost the fifth, which happened to be the derby against Milan. This time it was the opponents who had played defensively, but Mourinho was less understanding. \u201cIt\u2019s better to lose a game than to be afraid of playing football,\u201d he said. \u201cMilan have a lot of experience and they know how to control the tempo, commit a tactical foul or pretend to have an injury to slow down the pace.\u201d Kak\u00e1 was singled out, having in Mourinho\u2019s eyes feigned being fouled. The Brazilian rejected the accusation: \u201cMourinho makes me laugh. He\u2019s funny.\u201d Mourinho had the last laugh, though, as Inter won the league.</p> <p>After <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2010/may/22/inter-champions-league-final-bayern\">winning the Champions League with Inter</a>, Mourinho made his move to Real where he had the best start of his career. Madrid went unbeaten in all competitions until the end of November, but that defeat was a calamity, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2010/nov/29/barcelona-real-madrid-la-liga\">the 5-0 <em>manita</em> whitewash by Barcelona</a> that remains the worst defeat in his career. The performance was so bad, he could not even single anyone out. \u201cI leave disappointed both in my team and my players, individually,\u201d he said.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/sep/19/marouane-fellaini-wayne-rooney-short-manchester-united-watford\">Fellaini and Rooney out of place in altered Manchester United system | Michael Cox</a> </p> </aside>  <p>When <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/jun/03/jose-mourinho-confirmed-chelsea-manager\">Mourinho returned to Chelsea</a> as \u201cthe Happy One\u201d in 2013, he seemed content to pursue Roman Abramovich\u2019s ambitions of expansive, attacking football. That changed with his first defeat, in his fourth match, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/sep/14/everton-premier-league-chelsea\">1-0 at Everton</a>. Mourinho\u2019s verdict: \u201cArtistic football is no use without goals.\u201d He went on to blame Andr\u00e9 Sch\u00fcrrle for missing \u201cthree big chances\u201d, before adding, in the same breath: \u201cI don\u2019t like to be critical of players who missed some chances.\u201d</p> <p>Chelsea went on to win the league the following year, but yet the abiding memory of Mourinho\u2019s second stint at the club will be the awful defence of their title and his graceless part in it. Now, before the leaves have even begun to turn, he is under pressure again at Old Trafford.</p> <p>Mourinho has taken jobs at big clubs that have fallen from grace, those that have needed an overhaul and those with the very highest of expectations. It might be the first time, however, that he has taken a job combining all three. The scrutiny is hardly about to diminish.</p>",

I am grateful for the quick action of law enforcement in capturing the terrorist responsible for Saturday\u2019s bombings, and the off-duty police officer for stopping the terrorist in Minnesota. This weekend\u2019s attacks, from Minnesota to Manhattan, are just the latest to be carried out on US soil under President Obama. These should be a wake-up call for every American.</p> <p>Today, Hillary Clinton showed again that she will say anything - and blame anyone - to shift attention away from the weakness she showed as Secretary of State. The Obama-Clinton doctrine of not taking Isis seriously enough has emboldened terrorists all over the world. They are hoping and praying that Hillary Clinton becomes President so that they can continue their savagery and murder.</p> <p>While our President has referred to them as the \u2018J.V. Team\u2019 and Hillary Clinton calls them our \u2018determined enemies,\u2019 I have been willing to call them exactly what they are: radical Islamist terrorists.</p> <p>I will bring an end to these senseless acts of violence. They are wrong to say that we\u2019re in a fight about \u2018narratives.\u2019 These terrorists pose an existential threat to our country, our values, and our way of life.</p> <p>When I am President, terrorists like today\u2019s suspect in the New York and New Jersey bombings, Ahmad Khan Rahami, and yesterday\u2019s knife-wielding ISIS sympathizer in Minnesota, Dahir Adan, will be stopped. We will not look the other way. We will not allow political correctness and soft-on-terror, soft-on-crime policies to threaten our security and our lives.</p> <p>Revelations that the Obama Administration wrongly granted citizenship to over 800 immigrants awaiting deportation from countries of concern to national security or high rates of immigration fraud puts this weekend\u2019s attacks in a broader perspective. The safety and security of the homeland must be the overriding objective of our leaders when it comes to our immigration policy.</p> <p>That\u2019s why I\u2019ve proposed extreme vetting for immigrants from troubled parts of the world where terrorists live and train, and oppose Hillary Clinton\u2019s 550% increase in the number of refugees from the conflict in Syria. These are tough problems that require tough leadership. We need to get smart and get tough fast so that this weekend\u2019s attacks do not become the new normal here as it has in Europe and other parts of the world.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57e03907e4b051672d9f7e2c\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-19T19:14:52.227Z\">8.14pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Fox News Channel host and future press secretary Sean Hannity will host a town-hall meeting with Donald Trump in Ohio on Wednesday, according to Politico:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/Hadas_Gold/status/777948042859257856\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Hannity will do a Town Hall with Trump this Wednesday in Ohio</p>&mdash; Hadas Gold (@Hadas_Gold) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Hadas_Gold/status/777948042859257856\">September 19, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57e03541e4b0ef60eaef0f33\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-19T18:58:18.398Z\">7.58pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Bernie Sanders is feeling the...

  "<p>A UN aid convoy delivering food relief to a rebel-held area near Aleppo was targeted in an airstrike, as a week-old ceasefire brokered by Russia and the US collapsed with a new surge of Syrian government bombing. </p> <p>The US said it blamed Russia for the attack on the convoy, whether or not Russian planes were involved, arguing Moscow was responsible under the ceasefire agreement for reining in Bashar al-Assad\u2019s government forces. </p> <p>The attack on the convoy, made up of Syrian Red Crescent trucks carrying UN-supplied food, was reported to have killed at least 12 people and destroyed 18 trucks laden with food intended for tens of thousands of people cut off by the war in a rural area west of Aleppo city. </p> <p>Aid officials said it was hit from the air while unloading food at a warehouse in opposition controlled Urem al-Kubra. Early reports suggested most of the dead were Syrian Red Crescent drivers.</p> <p>Stephen O\u2019Brien, the UN\u2019s emergency relief coordinator, said that the convoy had been clearly marked and its route had been provided to all parties to the conflict. </p> <p>\u201cLet me be clear: if this callous attack is found to be a deliberate targeting of humanitarians, it would amount to a war crime,\u201d <a href=\"http://www.unocha.org/top-stories/all-stories/syria-unsarc-convoy-hit-urum-al-kubra-northwest-aleppo-city\">O\u2019Brien said</a>. \u201cI call for an immediate, impartial and independent investigation into this deadly incident.

But later on Monday, with the ceasefire just short of a week old, the Syrian army issued a statement blaming \u201cterrorist groups\u201d for hundreds of alleged violations and saying it would no longer observe the truce. The US-Russian ceasefire \u201cwas supposed to be a real chance to stop the bloodshed, but the armed terrorist groups flouted this agreement,\u201d the statement said.</p> <p>However both Kerry and the French foreign minister, Jean-Marc Ayrault, said Russia and its Syrian government allies had been responsible for the most serious violations.</p> <p>\u201cThe reality, according to the information we are getting from the ground, is that violations of the ceasefire are acts of the regime,\u201d Ayrault told reporters at the sidelines of a UN general assembly meeting in New York. </p> <p>The Syrian army declaration followed the bombing of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/19/week-old-syrian-ceasefire-hangs-in-balance\">Syrian army positions</a> around Deir ez-Zour by western coalition forces including the US, Britain, Denmark and Australia. The countries involved have said the strikes were aimed at Islamic State frontline positions and unintentionally hit Syrian troops as they fought to take those positions on Tharda mountain.</p> <p>Russia has said the strikes killed 62 Syrian soldiers and injured about 100 others, and the Syrian government has described the bombing as \u201con purpose and planned in advance\u201d.</p> <p>The collapse of the ceasefire came just as humanitarian convoys had restarted to some of the 18 civilian enclaves cut off by the war, 15 of which are besieged by Syrian government forces and their allies, according to the UN. Aid officials had been optimistic than two convoys of 20 trucks each might finally reach 250,000 besieged in rebel-controlled eastern Aleppo. </p> <p>Jan Egeland, the secretary general of the Norwegian Refugee Council and the humanitarian advisor to the UN special envoy for Syria, said the Aleppo convoys had been set to depart early on Tuesday morning. </p> <p>But Egeland told the Guardian: \u201cIt hinges on so little now.

We know that Becky died in 2003 and Sian in 2011. What I don\u2019t understand is why there is that gap and how he can turn from a mild-mannered taxi driver taking young vulnerable women home and on other occasions turn into a killer,\u201d he said.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/sep/19/chris-halliwell-becky-godden-killer-police-justice-steve-fulcher\">Chris Halliwell: painstaking fight to bring Becky Godden's killer to justice</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Memory told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme he did not have any lines of inquiry. \u201cI do know that Halliwell was very forensically aware. When he killed Sian he removed items of her clothing, he tried to get rid of fibres and he tried to get rid of items from his car. I definitely can\u2019t rule out he committed other offences. </p> <p>\u201cI appeal to him to say: \u2018You\u2019ve put two families through absolute hell. This is the time to come forward and if there are any other offences speak to me now.\u2019\u201d </p> <p>Memory referred to an odd exchange he had with Halliwell when he interviewed him in February last year. \u201cHe tried to strike a deal with me that if he would clear up Becky\u2019s murder that I would never interview him about anything ever again. </p> <p>\u201cOf course I couldn\u2019t give him that guarantee in case there are other rapes or murders. He said I didn\u2019t go far enough in the guarantees I\u2019d offer him. It\u2019s a strange deal to try to strike if there are no other victims. He wanted absolute immunity from prosecution for the rest of his life.\u201d</p> <p>Memory added: \u201cI will now go away and look at the timeline for Christopher Halliwell. He\u2019s been a taxi driver up and down the country, he\u2019s been a ground worker up and down the country. I\u2019ll look to other police forces to find out if they have missing people in similar circumstances and see if any of that fits into any of the evidence I have.\u201d</p> <p>In the mid-80s, while he was in prison for an unrelated offence, Halliwell asked an inmate how many women a person needed to kill before being considered a serial killer.</p> <p>And when police searched a remote pond where Halliwell dumped O\u2019Callaghan\u2019s boots after stabbing and strangling her in 2011, they discovered dozens of scraps of material that may be clothing.</p> <p>In common with many violent sexual offenders, Halliwell had a fascination with hardcore pornography, including child abuse and bestiality. Computer search terms he used showed he had an interest in murder, violent sex and rape.</p> <p>An extraordinary element of the case was the way Godden\u2019s body was found. Halliwell led police first to O\u2019Callaghan\u2019s body and then to the field where Godden\u2019s remains were to be unearthed. </p> <p>But because the officer in charge of the O\u2019Callaghan inquiry, Steve Fulcher, had ignored some of the rules governing the way suspects should be treated, Halliwell initially escaped justice over Godden\u2019s murder. </p> <p>Memory said he believed Fulcher had acted honestly, but was wrong in law. \u201cThere is a distinct possibility that Becky would still be in the ground now if it wasn\u2019t for those actions. I\u2019m utterly convinced she\u2019d still be there now. Nobody knew she was missing. They believed she had started a new life in Bristol.\u201d </p> <p>Asked if Fulcher, who resigned after facing disciplinary action and was now working as a consultant in Somalia, had been vindicated, he said: \u201cIt\u2019s very difficult for me to say. He made a very honestly held decision. However it was wrong in law.\u201d </p> <p>Halliwell will be sentenced at Bristol crown court on Friday.</p>",
  "<p>In the center of the largest city in Latin America, amid a forest of closely packed towers, snakes an elevated highway of more than three kilometers, slicing from east to west. During the week the traffic rumbles past apartment blocks, and cars swing by the upper floors so closely that residents can almost touch them as they whip past \u2013 or, more frequently, as they idle in S\u00e3o Paulo\u2019s notorious traffic. In the evenings and on Sundays, when it\u2019s closed to vehicles, <em><a href=\"https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/paulistano\">paulistanos</a> </em>descend on the elevated highway for cycling, walking, or partying.

And the highway growls in the shadows of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2016/sep/12/sao-paulo-biennial-artists-react-political-turmoil\">this year\u2019s S\u00e3o Paulo Biennial</a>, the region\u2019s most important contemporary art exhibition, which opened last week amid political protests. The short film Disseminate and Hold, by the artist <a href=\"http://www.rosabarba.com\">Rosa Barba</a>, introduces into Oscar Niemeyer\u2019s serene white pavilion the everyday disorder of the elevated highway, backed by a charging, drum-heavy score by the German-Brazilian group <a href=\"http://www.ctm-festival.de/archive/all-artists/a-e/black-manual/\">Black Manual</a>. It\u2019s one of the finest works in the exhibition, and it subtly connects Brazil\u2019s ambitious architectural past to its troubled political present.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m always attracted by these non-pretty, functional places,\u201d the Italian artist tells me when we meet for a drink at a rooftop hotel bar \u2013 whose privileged view of the sprawling city offers an apt backdrop. \u201cAnd Brazil was always a rich place of history for me. The encounter with Brazil came through readings, through <a href=\"http://equivalence.com/labor/lab_vf.shtml\">Vil\u00e9m Flusser\u2019s</a> history here, but also through the architecture. When I came here last year for research, I walked over the Minhoc\u00e3o after visiting the <a href=\"http://www.uncubemagazine.com/blog/9980709\">Copan building</a> \u2013 a worn, serpentine tower designed by Niemeyer in 1966, closely hemmed in by the highway and the surrounding buildings. \u201cI was so impressed how, in one second, when the traffic wasn\u2019t allowed to enter anymore, the people immediately took it over.\u201d</p> <p>The Minhoc\u00e3o was completed in 1969, at the height of Brazil\u2019s military dictatorship. (This past June, it was <a href=\"http://g1.globo.com/sao-paulo/noticia/2016/06/camara-muda-nome-do-minhocao-para-elevado-presidente-joao-goulart.html\">officially renamed</a> the Elevado Presidente Jo\u00e3o Goulart, in tribute to the Brazilian president who was ousted by a military junta in 1964.) If your visions of Brazil tend more to the beaches of Rio or the moonscapes of Bras\u00edlia, Barba\u2019s film will introduce you to a rougher, more delirious urbanism. Shooting on foot or from the back of a car, Barba pans across Brutalist towers, filthy ribbon windows, demotic apartments festooned with graffiti. And yet its messy, unpredictable character is what makes S\u00e3o Paulo so intoxicating: this is a city where spaces fold into one another and lives collide.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"75fcaf59239b3cd35e8b0c62df48b5a3cf3d3dc7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/75fcaf59239b3cd35e8b0c62df48b5a3cf3d3dc7/60_0_1800_1080/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Barba pans across Brutalist towers, filthy ribbon windows, demotic apartments festooned with graffiti.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Barba pans across Brutalist towers, filthy ribbon windows, demotic apartments festooned with graffiti.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy of Rosa Barba</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Overlaying these shots of S\u00e3o Paulo in Disseminate and Hold is a text by the artist <a href=\"http://www.galerielelong.com/artist/cildo-meireles\">Cildo Meireles</a>, a Brazilian conceptualist and a key figure of cultural opposition to the dictatorship. As Barba pans up from the Minhoc\u00e3o to Niemeyer\u2019s tower, a narrator reads Meireles\u2019s words: \u201cI remember that in 68, 69, 70, as we were on a tangent away from that which mattered\u201d \u2013 by <em>that which mattered</em>, he means <em>democracy</em> \u2013 \u201calready we no longer worked with metaphors \u2026 We were working with the situation itself, the real.\u201d</p> <p>The narration helps to draw an imperfect but fascinating analogy between the public interventions of the <a href=\"http://hyperallergic.com/62893/brazilian-art-under-dictatorship/\">Brazilian avant garde during the dictatorship</a> and the contemporary reuse of the Minhoc\u00e3o: a top-down imposition now rethought from the bottom up. \u201cSomehow I thought that this voice of Cildo, the text excerpts, could be a strong voice from the street itself,\u201d Barba explains. \u201cIt\u2019s really part of his thinking of the public body. My favorite excerpt is when Cildo says that art can only exist if other people perform it. I was seeing myself performing his voice, and bringing it back to the public.\u201d</p> <p>The S\u00e3o Paulo biennial has always had a strong political focus, and Meireles was one of numerous Brazilian artists to boycott the exhibition of 1969 \u2013 the year of the Minhoc\u00e3o\u2019s completion. The artists, some of whom had already gone into exile, stayed away in protest of the military government\u2019s infamous <a href=\"https://www.mtholyoke.edu/~athay20m/classweb/censorshipbrazil/page3.html\">Institutional Act No 5</a>, which suspended habeas corpus, permitted censorship, and soon opened the way to torture. Barba\u2019s film looks at this history too. We see Meireles\u2019s file from the biennial archives, as well as a telegram from<a href=\"http://www.moma.org/lygiaclark\"> Lygia Clark</a>, exiled in Paris, and a postcard from <a href=\"http://moma.org/artists/7715\">H\u00e9lio Oiticica</a>, who\u2019d gone to London. All of them refuse to participate. Suddenly, against the roll of a snare drum, Barba cuts back to the Minhoc\u00e3o: we\u2019re looking at traffic from an overpass, on which someone has spray painted TEMER JAMAIS (\u201cNever Temer\u201d), a rebuke to the new Brazilian president whose ascent has been described by many artists here as a coup.<br> </p> <p>The current upheaval in Brazil had consequences for Barba\u2019s production, but Disseminate and Hold wears its political convictions lightly. \u201cI tried to get material from the Cinemateca, and that week <a href=\"http://www1.folha.uol.com.br/ilustrada/2016/07/1795483-ministerio-da-cultura-demite-cupula-da-cinemateca.shtml\">people were fired</a>,\u201d Barba says. \u201cIt was quite impossible to pay people: for rental equipment, say. Money was transferred would get stuck, frozen for months, and then you\u2019d have to negotiate what the exchange rate should be \u2026 Things were changing every week, and even people in the biennial didn\u2019t know how to handle it.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1cb445f963f7637803bd9774d606cf442ee456b0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1cb445f963f7637803bd9774d606cf442ee456b0/60_0_1800_1080/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The highway is known locally as the giant earthworm.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The highway is known locally as the giant earthworm.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy of Rosa Barba</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cI was thinking: oh, should I connect it much more to what is happening now? But except for that one shot of TEMER JAMAIS, I actually felt it would be so much stronger if I didn\u2019t close the circle. You are in it anyway. I felt that if I would go there I would close the bottle somehow.\u201d</p> <p>Barba was born in Sicily in 1972. She studied both film-making and fine arts, and you can see that double training in the attention given to her films\u2019 display: rattling projectors sit in the gallery, and film strips are treated as both recordings and physical objects. She now lives in Berlin, and uses <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/oct/13/close-up-tacita-dean\">the increasingly obsolete medium of celluloid</a> to examine how technological change, political events, or economic transformations are manifest in cities and landscapes. <a href=\"http://www.meyer-riegger.de/en/data/artists/50/rosa-barba.html\">Bending to Earth</a>, which was seen at the last Venice Biennale, orbits around desert sites for radioactive waste storage that, seen from above, appear as serene, monochrome squares. Her omnibus film <a href=\"https://www.turnercontemporary.org/exhibitions/rosa-barba\">Subconscious Society</a> passes from Manchester\u2019s <a href=\"http://untappedcities.com/2012/11/06/inside-manchesters-abandoned-albert-hall/\">abandoned Albert Hall</a> to the Thames estuary, which Barba filmed from the air as an uncanny collection of outdated industrial sites and abandoned funfairs. She shot it on the very last shipment ever made of Fuji 35mm film.</p> <p>Subconscious Society netted Barba a <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.fondationprincepierre.mc/en/prix/international-prize-of-contemporary-art/003/international-prize-of-contemporary-art.html\">major prize</a> from the Fondation Prince Pierre de Monaco, which also funded this new Brazilian work. But in comparison to the languorous, often sublime films of the last few years, Disseminate and Hold is a more human-scaled work of art. Inhabitants of the apartments bordering the Minhoc\u00e3o speak of the highway\u2019s place in their lives; they sit and kibitz on a highway divider, and by the film\u2019s end they are dancing across the giant earthworm. Geography bears the scars of politics, but people can make an impact too.</p> <p>Barba, at one point, struts down the Minhoc\u00e3o on a Sunday morning, camera in hand. The sun shines down, and the tangle of roads and buildings looks almost pastoral: with no cars, the road has become an unexpected place of relaxation in a very jittery city. \u201cIt becomes this public body, the street,\u201d Barba attests. \u201cIt\u2019s a performative manifestation all the time. You can expand the public\u2019s voice \u2013 maybe in a much more powerful way \u2013 if you take over architecture in the city.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>The perfect global rugby season will never exist. Well, maybe it does on paper but not in reality. There are competing hemispheres, unions and clubs to pacify, not to mention different financial imperatives, audiences, time-zones and ambitions. Sticking half-a-dozen adolescent ferrets down your trousers simultaneously is slightly less problematic.</p> <p>Now imagine all six ferrets arriving with their own legal advisers and you begin to grasp the unenviable situation facing World Rugby as it attempts to broker a schedule that suits everyone. Small wonder the initial proposals to have emerged from negotiations have fallen short of jaw-dropping. A suspension of summer Test tours in the year after a World Cup? The northern hemisphere club season poking into June? The Six Nations staying broadly, if not exactly, where it is? We are talking cautious diplomacy, not revolution.</p> <p>Perhaps there should be gratitude for such small mercies, given the worldwide Test diary between World Cups is currently blank from 2019 onwards. There will inevitably be some sort of compromise. But what price a sport so wrapped in self-interest it cannot see the bigger picture: players abandoning cash-strapped unions to flock to wealthy club leagues overseas, a dominant world-leading side making many of their rivals look pedestrian, too many meaningless games in front of mediocre crowds. Fail to think about the many rather than just the few and everyone will be poorer.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/sep/01/global-season-new-zealand-home-nations-rugby-union-the-breakdown\">Global season will only happen if New Zealand and home nations work together | Paul Rees</a> </p> </aside>  <p>So who, precisely, should any new structure be looking to satisfy? The easy answer is television, because it pays the bills. Not so fast. If your competitions are so compelling, your product so attractive, your players so skilful and the queues for tickets so long, the TV and advertising dollars will follow automatically. That is the problem, from a distance, with Super Rugby, which will continue in its present bloated format next year. Full stadia and logistical sense are only minor considerations, prompting an increasing raft of players from Australia and South Africa, in particular, to seek a more fulfilling professional life in Europe.</p> <p>No, the secret is to make the players feel they have the best of both worlds: playing a great game and not being flogged to death for the privilege of doing so. If they are fresh and playing good opposition on decent surfaces, everyone benefits. If they are happy and fulfilled, fans and advertisers will take even more of a shine to them. If they say they do not want to get on a plane every five minutes, it probably pays to listen to them.</p> <p>They also need to be protected from themselves. Watch a game of modern Premiership rugby and it is a minor miracle anyone lasts until Christmas, never mind next July when the 2017 Lions tour wraps up. Less is unquestionably more, certainly for the leading players. To expect them to prepare for 22 league games and potential play-offs, plus nine European club fixtures and a further 12 Tests per year is ludicrous; in a decade\u2019s time it will probably be illegal.</p> <p>So let\u2019s draw up something with the players\u2019 interests front and centre. They still want to play in big games for their clubs and represent their countries to the best of their ability. Having a fallow summer once in a while would be beneficial and it would help to formalise the current summer and autumn Test format as well.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/sep/01/lions-tour-treadmill-premiership-pro-12-rugby\">Lions tour the prize but first comes treadmill even robots would find wearing | Robert Kitson</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Why not split the world rankings into groups of six \u2013 New Zealand, England, Australia, South Africa, Wales and Ireland would currently be in the premier division \u2013 and require them all to play each other in the same calendar year? England could go to NZ and Australia in June and play the remaining three in Europe in November, although there is nothing to stop the All Blacks, say, travelling north in June if required. The top two would contest the Global Test Challenge final in late November with the winners collecting the newly minted Gus Pichot trophy. The bottom two would play off, as happens in tennis\u2019s Davis Cup, to avoid dropping to the next level where Argentina, France, Scotland, Fiji, Georgia and Japan would be vying to replace them. Arrange for the Six Nations to start slightly later in March and, suddenly, there is a fresh, invigorating, more meritocratic feel to the landscape. Not to mention shorter tours.</p> <p>It will not happen immediately but let us just imagine something similar was kicking off in 2018. The draw would be made the previous year, giving everyone plenty of time to market the fixtures. The grand final could be played at a neutral venue if that helps logistically; Ireland are already due to face New Zealand in Chicago in November. Income from worldwide ticket sales, television revenue and sponsorship would be pooled and fairly allocated, rather than the host nation pocketing everything. Nor, with the final being played in the first week of December, would it clash unduly with football\u2019s World Cup.</p> <p>That would mean a player such as Dylan Hartley or Alun Wyn Jones playing 11 Tests, to include any final or play-off. A World Cup season would be the only year that figure rises to 12. Only in the two other autumns might there be traditional incoming three-Test tours to Europe, including midweek games against keen club opposition. A world club shootout between the winners of the four major competitions \u2013 Premiership, Pro12, Super Rugby and Top 14 \u2013 is another alternative.</p> <p>Domestically, things will need tweaking on a case-by-case basis. Expanding the Premiership to reflect the fact there are, at most, 16 clubs in England who can hope to sustain viable professional rugby is one option; a conference system with enhanced play-offs might work. Either way, international players would not start playing until October and would also be otherwise engaged during international periods. The European club competition would reach its climax on the first weekend in June alongside an enhanced spring-time sevens schedule.</p> <p>Two summer Tests to finish (aside from Lions years) and July and August would be hammock months in the northern hemisphere. The Top&#xa0;14 in France might have to bend slightly while the Rugby Football Union would need to swallow a significant potential reduction in Twickenham match income but the benefits of greater collective drawing power and worldwide sponsorship potential would be huge. Better-marketed women\u2019s internationals and age-grade fixtures could all further enhance the mix. Get the balance right and, in 20 years\u2019 time, there could be millions thinking: \u201cThis is far more fun than watching football.\u201d</p> <h2>Players\u2019 health check</h2> <p>Have you passed the age of 30 and played rugby union or league as either a professional, semi-professional or an amateur? If so, your sport needs you. Experts at the Carnegie Research Institute at Leeds Beckett University are looking to study how former players fare health-wise in later life, following previous studies at the Auckland University of Technology (AUT) and the University of Aberdeen. The researchers are looking to recruit \u201cas many men over 30 as possible\u201d to study whether there are any links between concussions and longer-term neurological well-being, as well as assessing the muscle, bone, joint and cardiometabolic health of former players.</p> <p>Dr Karen Hind, senior research fellow in the school of sport at Leeds Beckett, is well aware of the upside of rugby \u2013 \u201cA life of rugby provides so many benefits for those taking part\u201d \u2013 but the New Zealand study uncovered some worrying findings, suggesting former rugby players suffered from more general health issues, including arthritis and more hazardous alcohol drinking behaviour, than people who used to play non-contact sport.</p> <p>\u201cOur project will examine links between concussions and future health, but it is also a broad study of how people who played rugby are getting on later in life,\u201d said Dr Hind. \u201cWe have previously found vertebral fractures in one out of three current professional players so we will also be exploring this in retired players. We need people to enrol regardless of how they are getting on \u2013 whether they are happy and healthy or having difficulty with any aspect of their lives. We also need people who haven\u2019t taken part in rugby post-school so that we can compare findings.\u201d</p> <h2>Technology on the blink </h2> <p>A minor detail but at the last three Premiership matches attended by your correspondent \u2013 all at different grounds around the country in the past 10 days \u2013 the electronic big screen or stadium clock has been on the blink for some or all of the game. There were also issues at the Bath v Newcastle fixture. Apparently, this is often the responsibility of outside contractors rather than the individual club but, currently, spectators everywhere are not being brilliantly served.</p>",

  "<p>A shootout on the streets of New Jersey ended a dramatic manhunt on Monday as police arrested a man suspected of involvement in weekend bombings that injured 29 people in New York.</p> <p>Ahmad Khan Rahami, a 28-year-old naturalized US citizen born in Afghanistan, had hours earlier been named in a \u201cwanted\u201d <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/19/new-york-explosion-suspect-mobile-alert-ahmad-khan-rahami\">alert sent to millions of local cellphones</a> as Manhattan prepared to host world leaders at the United Nations general assembly.</p> <p>At a media briefing on Monday afternoon, police and FBI officials said they had linked Rahami to Saturday\u2019s bombing in Chelsea, another unexploded device found nearby, both constructed in pressure cookers packed with metallic fragmentation material.

Nkosazana Dlamini Zuma, the chair of the AU commission, declared it was a \u201cstep towards \u2026 a strong, prosperous and integrated Africa, driven by its own citizens and capable of taking its rightful place on the world stage.\u201d</p> <p>Aisha Abdullahi, commissioner for political affairs at the AU, has since said the organisation has recruited consultants who are formulating plans for an African single market, which they hope to implement by 2017.</p> <p>But while diplomats were promised access to the passports by 2018, it quickly became clear that the continent\u2019s 1.1 billion people would have to wait longer, as the project is reliant on national governments passing individual legislation.</p> <p>And as in Europe, which after 40 years as a beacon of free trade and movement is showing signs of an existential crisis, migration is proving a contentious issue. </p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/oct/15/revolutionary-spirit-pan-african-congress\">pan-africanist movement</a>, a cornerstone of the AU, has long called for closer unity on a continent scarred by the arbitrary map-drawing of colonial times, but leaders are worried by what they\u2019ve seen in Europe. Abdullahi said the challenges exposed in the European project have been a warning sign. </p> <p>\u201cFree movement has many economic and social benefits, but we know that there are concerns,\u201d Abdullahi said. \u201cThis is why we are not doing it in a loose fashion, or like<strong> </strong>European free movement.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/MacJordaN/status/754838219586285568\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Check out the African Union Diplomatic Passport launched in Kigali yesterday.

He stressed that while international media has focused on mass migration from Africa to Europe, 80% of Africans who migrate do so within the continent, with less than 20% travelling to Europe.</p> <p>This has brought serious problems, most recently with a spate of xenophobic attacks in South Africa, which has the second biggest migrant population on the continent after Ivory Coast. About 300 businesses run by migrants were destroyed, and workers from countries such as Zimbabwe and Mozambique were attacked.</p> <h2>Real unity?</h2> <p>So amid optimistic talk of a \u201cUnited States of Africa\u201d, critics have been quick to point out that the union has been catastrophically weak in dealing with continental crises and supporting populations under attack.</p> <p>Though it has deployed peacekeeping forces to Somalia and Darfur, and has recently agreed <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2016/07/19/486592426/african-union-approves-plan-to-put-peacekeeping-force-in-south-sudan\">to send troops to South Sudan</a>, it has been accused of largely ignoring the brutal <a href=\"http://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-mali-rebels-africa-idUKBRE90Q06Z20130127\">jihadi occupation in northern Mali</a>, <a href=\"http://newafricanmagazine.com/ebola-au-done-enough/\">the deadly Ebola outbreak</a> in west Africa, and failing to hold \u201cpresidents for life\u201d to account.</p> <p>This ambiguous approach to democratic principles has led to a situation in which Chad\u2019s president, Idriss D\u00e9by, who recently extended his 26-year rule amid accusations of vote rigging, intimidation and holding \u201cthe whole country hostage\u201d, is now <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/06/chads-president-set-to-mediate-in-disputed-gabon-election\">mediating</a> in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/31/gabon-election-results-disputed-incumbent-ali-bongo-victor-jean-ping\">an election crisis in Gabon</a>. </p> <p>Dapo Oyewole, director of the Policy Development Network, said the AU needs to change its image if it is to truly bring about continental unity. </p> <p> \u201cThe African Union needs to become much more active and meaningfully relevant in the day-to-day life of average Africans,\u201d he said. \u201cIt has to become an accessible and responsive platform for actualising collective aspirations and not just like a club of African leaders.\u201d<br></p> <p>But the new project shows promise says Imad Mesdoua, an Algerian political analyst based in London. \u201cThe new inter-African passport is proof that member states are genuine about making integration a reality,\u201d he said, but added \u201cmore needs to be done and at a much faster pace.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Facebook has emerged as newspapers\u2019 public enemy number one. Hardly a day passes in which there is no negative article about the social media website that is luring away \u201cour\u201d readers and advertisers. </p> <p>In the past couple of weeks, there has been something of an overload of criticism on a range of topics. </p> <p>There was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/sep/09/facebook-reinstates-napalm-girl-photo\">the blocking of the image of a girl fleeing a napalm attack in Vietnam</a>. It generated outrage from, among others, Norway\u2019s prime minister Erna Solberg <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/09/facebook-napalm-vietnamese-deleted-norway\">in the Guardian</a>, Jane Fae <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2016/09/12/facebook-is-imposing-prissy-american-censorship-on-the-whole-res/\">in the Daily Telegraph</a> and Dominic Lawson <a href=\"http://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/for-facebook-its-iconic-war-photos-out-nude-blackmail-snaps-in-l02cckdqp\">in the Sunday Times</a> (an excellent piece).</p> <p>Facebook\u2019s tax affairs <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/jul/29/facebook-us-tax-investigation-irs-ireland\">have come under the microscope</a>. Questions were raised about Facebook\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/facebook-gives-users-power-to-stop-the-most-annoying-adverts-33k5xnpgb\">attack on ad-blocking software</a> (as if that isn\u2019t in the interest of every news outlet). And there have been plenty of critical articles about Facebook\u2019s news feeds, notably its \u201ctrending topics\u201d feature.</p> <p>It is argued that this narrows users\u2019 news agenda by advising (or \u201ctelling\u201d) them what to read. Evidently, people are bound to follow the herd. According to <a href=\"http://www.journalism.org/2016/05/26/news-use-across-social-media-platforms-2016/\">a Pew Research Center study released in May</a>, 66% of Facebook users get news through the site. </p> <p>These choices are made by algorithms, which can monitor users\u2019 interests and then \u201cfeed\u201d them what it believes they wish to read while filtering out material they are supposed not to want. This system therefore creates an \u201cecho chamber\u201d or \u201cfilter bubble\u201d effect. </p> <p>So, <a href=\"http://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/facebook-news-is-not-all-it-seems-cldwzfvqn\">noted a Times writer in an article on Saturday</a>, \u201cthe news on Facebook is what Facebook says it is.\u201d</p> <p>Although I nodded in agreement I couldn\u2019t help but remind myself that it conveniently overlooked the fact that before the arrival of the internet news in newspapers was what newspapers said it was. </p> <p>It has always been the case from the dawn of media that the controllers of news outlets - newspapers, TV and radio, online - make choices about what to publish and, more significantly, what not to publish. So is there a real need to be especially concerned about Facebook?</p> <p>Yes, writes the Guardian\u2019s Jemima Kiss in the latest issue of the British Journalism Review. In her article, \u201c<a href=\"http://www.bjr.org.uk/current-edition+a_giant_that_may_eat_us\">A giant that may eat us</a>\u201d, she contends that the world\u2019s leading social media site is exerting both an \u201cincreasing domination of internet advertising revenue and control of a significant part of a critical distribution platform.\u201d</p> <p>Users \u201cwillingly pour endless personal information about themselves into Facebook\u201d and that enables the site \u201cto sell targeted advertising around them.\u201d</p> <p>By contrast, even the most advanced and successful of newspaper websites are unable to do the same. They can\u2019t compete, she writes, with such sophisticated targeting. Hence the difficulty all are facing in trying to secure enough digital ad revenue to fund their journalism. </p> <p>Kiss doesn\u2019t develop this single point explicitly. But I will. Facebook\u2019s increasing dominance over advertising is causing the laying off of journalists, the people who produce the news that it transmits to its users.</p> <p>The logical conclusion to that process is not only the destruction of old media, legacy media, mainstream media, whatever you want to call it, but the end of journalism as we know it.</p> <p>Before cynics shout about that not being a bad thing (while digital optimists assert that independent, and therefore better, journalism will arise in its place), think of the perils we face without a collective of organised, skilled journalists working for organisations large enough to hold power to account.</p> <p>The Facebookisation of news has the potential to destabilise democracy by, first, controlling what we read and, second, by destroying the outlets that provide that material. <br></p> <p>Kiss cites a Pew Research Center study which found that Facebook is far and away the most popular site for sharing news in the United States. </p> <p>Turning to the controversy over the control exercised over news choices, she points out that although human editors have been replaced by algorithms, those \u201crobots\u201d are, of course, designed by humans. So decisions on what appears and doesn\u2019t appear is neither neutral nor impartial.</p> <p>Similarly, by creating news feeds that give people what they are supposed to want, those people rarely, if ever, see material offering a different perspective. (Again, I concede that that may well have been the case in the newsprint world. If you read, say, the Daily Mail or the Daily Mirror every day, are you not locked out from alternative views?)</p> <p>Kiss argues that Facebook\u2019s newsfeed also encourages \u201csuperficial engagement \u2013 a like or a share that endorses only the idea of the headline, because the newsfeed offers no incentive to wait, click through and actually read a news story to the end.\u201d</p> <p>And she is surely on strong ground in questioning the lack of transparency involved in the decisions Facebook makes in creating, and continually tweaking, its algorithms.</p> <p>She writes: \u201cIt is likely that protecting journalism is not a priority for Facebook, where engineers hold the power and the solution is nearly always sought through technology.\u201d</p> <p>Her conclusion casts the matter in a stark light. Facebook is an undoubted commercial success and it has achieved it fairly \u201cin a competitive open market.\u201d</p> <p>But, she writes, \u201cjournalism is more than just a business \u2013 it has a crucial and under-acknowledged social purpose that in this era of instability, isolationist politics and barely scrutinised power and wealth is more important than ever.\u201d </p> <p>I could not agree more. That\u2019s the mission imperilled by Facebook.</p>",

  "<p>Ever since the European court ordered Google to delist a 16-year-old article about a bankruptcy, web watchers have wondered how the \u2018right to be forgotten\u2019 would evolve.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/may/13/spain-everyman-google-mario-costeja-gonzalez\">Mario Costeja Gonz\u00e1lez</a>\u2019s \u2018<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/blog/2014/may/14/mario-costeja-gonzalez-fight-right-forgotten\">Data and Goliath\u2019 victory in 2014</a> in Spain has meant that human concepts of fairness are now applied to Google Search, which is subject to European data protection laws.</p> <p>But there are now worrying new signs from Europe that the right is being applied directly against news websites and not just search engines.</p> <p>The highest court in Italy recently upheld a ruling that, after a period of two years, an article in an online news archive had expired, \u201cjust like milk, yoghurt or a pint of ice-cream\u201d.</p> <p>This is a significant departure from previous applications of the right, which have always distinguished between delisting Google search results and removing content at source. Unlike previous courts, the Roman court has blamed the source, not the messenger.</p> <p>The news website in question, <a href=\"http://www.primadanoi.it/\">\u2018Primadanoi\u2019</a> (\u2018The First Among Us\u2019), a small website in Abruzzo, is outraged and has re-christened the \u2018right to be forgotten\u2019 (\u2018il diritto d\u2019oblio\u2019 in Italian), \u2018the crime of oblivion\u2019 (\u2018il delitto d\u2019oblio\u2019). Having had a sell-by date applied to its journalism, Primadanoi, is indeed now \u2018The First Among Us\u2019, but not in the way it would like.</p> <p>This latest story begins on 23 March 2006 when Primadanoi published an article about a criminal case involving a restaurant owner. That is all we know about the article because the court has both redacted the names of the parties and omitted any reference to why the article was, in its view, \u2018particularly sensitive\u2019.</p> <p>The owner didn\u2019t like it, or more specifically, didn\u2019t like it when, if people googled him or his restaurant, Google helpfully served up Primadanoi\u2019s article along with adverts for his business. He demanded Primadanoi remove it.</p> <p>When it refused, he issued legal proceedings, claiming reputational damage, privacy infringement and violation of his \u2018right to be forgotten\u2019 \u2013 even though the latter had never been applied against a news website.</p> <p>Primadanoi relented and, six months after the request, removed the article. But the owner was not at all <em tabindex=\"-1\">felice</em> with the six-month delay (a long time in pasta sales?) and pursued the website to court in Ortona, demanding compensation.</p> <p>The judge ordered Primadanoi to pay him and the restaurant \u20ac5,000 (\u00a34,300) each, even confiscating the editor\u2019s car as security. When Primadanoi appealed, the second court, at Chieti agreed that the newspaper\u2019s right to freedom of expression had expired after two years, and punishment was apt for the six-month delay.</p> <p>The website appealed to the supreme court of cassation in Rome, which said the complaint was \u2018well-founded\u2019 and the punishment fair.</p> <p>In their ruling \u2013 which will cast a chill among journalists everywhere \u2013 the judges in Rome attached great importance to the availability of the archived article via Google Search, stressing that online material needs treating differently because, even if archived, it is \u201cconsultable simply by typing the name of the claimant and the name of the restaurant into the Google search engine\u201d.</p> <p>But, unlike their previous European counterparts, they failed to consider the alternative, as explained in the original Google Spain ruling, that: \u201cpublishers of websites have the option of indicating to operators of search engines, by means of particular exclusion protocols, such as \u2018robot.txt\u2019 or codes such as \u2018noindex\u2019 or \u2018noarchive\u2019, that they wish specific information published on their site to be wholly or partially excluded from search engines\u2019 automatic indexes\u201d.</p> <p>This failure to distinguish between source and search engine caused Primadanoi to thunder that \u2018Italian law does not understand technology or the internet\u2019.</p> <p>And indeed, the judgment does read like a proper legal mix-up, blending different areas of law (libel, privacy and data protection) into a novelty soup where separate causes of action with distinct defences and protections float about indistinguishably.</p> <p>Consequently, in Italy at least, \u2018the right to be forgotten\u2019 now has a new meaning: the right to remove inconvenient journalism from archives after two years<em>.</em></p> <p>This surely cannot be right. If it was, everyone would demand deletions from news websites and online journalism would be decimated.</p> <p>The law provides journalists with exemptions that are not available to other processors of data, such as robotic search engines. Otherwise newspapers would be empty and society starved of information.</p> <p>In Italian law, this allows for the use of data \u201cin the exercise of the profession of journalism and for the exclusive pursuit of the relevant goals\u201d.</p> <p>Primadanoi repeatedly argued this exemption in court. And given that the exemption applies to processing legal data and processing of sensitive data, you would have thought they had a point.</p> <p>Not according to the supreme court, which basically ignored it. The reason they could do so, it seems, is a flaw in the protection offered to journalists by Italian law, once articles are no longer current.</p> <p>As with English law, the Italian code dictates that \u2018data must be kept in a form which allows identification for a period of time not beyond that which is necessary for the purposes for which they were collected.\u2019</p> <p>However, unlike in England, journalism is not exempted from this \u2018time limit\u2019, placing Italian journalists at a significant disadvantage to their English counterparts, who can, under the Data Protection Act, keep using and publishing the data if they have a reasonable belief that publication is in the public interest.</p> <p>This leaves Italian editors vulnerable to arguments that their product has \u2018now been published for long enough\u2019 and must be taken down.</p> <p>Indeed, the supreme court followed precisely this reasoning in concluding: \u201cThe time passed between the date it [the article] was first published and the date when its removal was requested, sufficed to satisfy the public interest as far as its right to be informed was concerned, and that therefore, at least from the date when the formal notice was received, that data could no longer be disclosed.\u201d</p> <p>Whether the \u2018out of date\u2019 stamp issued to a two-year-old article will now be applied elsewhere remains to be seen.</p> <p>It will be a case of watch this URL \u2013 but if you\u2019re reading from Italy, you\u2019d better be quick, before it goes off.</p> <p><em>Athalie Matthews is an in-house lawyer at Guardian News and Media</em></p>",
  "<h2>I wish I\u2019d known\u2026 to apply for halls on time</h2> <p>Bournemouth had scant student accommodation, so those like me who applied late to halls were farmed out to local families. My first year was spent living with a monstrous couple and their sad-eyed children in a house that stank of vegetable oil. The family did karaoke at 3am, and furnished our living room with four dining chairs and a Melinda Messenger nude calendar. At one point, our landlord tried to move us in with his friend Gunner, who got his name because he had a gun and shot people. I wish I hadn\u2019t been a latecomer. <strong>Stuart Heritage</strong></p> <h2>I wish I\u2019d known<strong>\u2026 to not be \u2018rubber chicken guy\u2019</strong></h2> <p>I decided to make myself stand out at Dundee Freshers\u2019 Week by taking a rubber chicken I had found on the floor and making it \u201cmy thing\u201d. I bought blue WKDs, poured them down the bird\u2019s throat, and drank from it all night. I was rubber chicken guy, and everybody loved rubber chicken guy. At 1am, during a DJ set by Justin from Hollyoaks, my throat stiffened and seized. I fell to my knees and began to dry heave. Eventually, I was taken to Ninewells hospital. Turns out I\u2019m allergic to a chemical used to treat rubber toys, as most humans are when it\u2019s placed in their mouths every five minutes for seven hours. Don\u2019t be someone you\u2019re not at university; don\u2019t be rubber chicken guy.<strong> Joe Zadeh</strong></p> <h2>I wish I\u2019d known<strong>\u2026 that it\u2019s OK to feel lost</strong></h2> <p>The nose stud was quite grim. As was the leather jacket. But mostly I wish I\u2019d known it was OK to feel lost. Literally lost. I did a degree in journalism and I was bad at it. No confidence, no map-reading skills. Once I spent a whole day walking around a seaside town crying, unable to find a local councillor I\u2019d arranged to interview about the local graffiti problem. I thought my dreams were over. Thank god someone invented Google Maps.<strong> Harriet Gibsone</strong></p> <h2>I wish I\u2019d known<strong>\u2026 to buy an electric heater</strong></h2> <p>Pretty much my only memory of being a student is feeling cold. So cold. The kind of cold I can still feel in my bones half a lifetime later. Just hearing the titles of some of the books I studied brings back muscle memories of leaning against the radiator in my room that blew its heat straight out of the draughty window. So I wish I\u2019d known I was allowed to buy an electric heater. I also wish I\u2019d known that I wasn\u2019t less smart, less popular and less experienced than everyone else there, as I believed at the time.

At one party, during a rowdy set from an acoustic ruffian whose signature song went \u201cBuckfast/ It gets you fucked fast\u201d, so many punks pummelled the low ceiling that it collapsed on us. Worse, maybe, there was always someone with skidmarks cooking vegan stew in the kitchen when I just wanted to make toast. Punks: they are smelly and they will make your student accommodation implode. Think wisely before moving in with one, or five. <strong>Kate Hutchinson</strong></p> <h2>I wish I\u2019d known<strong>... not to be \u2018vibey\u2019</strong></h2> <p>Look, here\u2019s a bit of hard-won wisdom for you: Rocking up on your first day in student halls wearing a belt buckle with a slide-out Zippo lighter in it and immediately pinning up a Fear and Loathing poster does not make you look as cool and dangerous as you think it does. You are not \u2018vibey\u2019. Put out the joss sticks, the whole floor can still smell the soapbar spliffs you smuggled up from Devon. In time your German roommate will learn that no, it isn\u2019t all \u201ctotally legal\u201d here since \u201cthey changed the law\u201d. He won\u2019t be gl\u00fccklich.

Instead, I got a neighbour who put up a Friends poster in the communal kitchen at a jaunty angle and a chance to join the Belle And Sebastian Society if I could keep up with their consumption of Ribena. The niceness was catastrophically disillusioning. How I longed for someone to be sick in my sink. <strong>Bella Todd</strong></p> <h2>I wish I\u2019d known\u2026 <strong>to stop drinking after fresher\u2019s week</strong></h2> <p>I learned nothing of any use at university and got kicked out after five terms for being a drunk. I did learn how to smoke cannabis through a coke can (or through an apple if there were no coke cans available). I also learned how to shout \u2018Fuck the Boers\u2019 in Xhosa. I learned how to play the riff to My New House by The Fall loud on an electric guitar until my neighbour came round and threatened to kill me with a shovel. I learned how to lose all my possessions and my mental well being. I learned how to alienate nearly everyone I met. I learned how to lose my self respect and eventually I learned how to become homeless. I was the first person in my entire family to go to university and I squandered the experience for sherry and low grade LSD. It remains one of the few deep and lasting regrets I have in life. No matter how anxious you feel in new situations, alcohol is neither a medium nor long term solution. <strong>John Doran</strong></p> <h2>I wish I\u2019d known\u2026<strong> that first year is actually important</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"de9b43bf5338eb1555ed18f9d9d169df9d9e0403\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/de9b43bf5338eb1555ed18f9d9d169df9d9e0403/140_155_5312_3189/1000.jpg\" alt=\"undefined\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>I wish I\u2019d known a few things: a hairdo that looks like BoJo suplexing a labrador will result in an entirely involuntary period of erotic abstinence; if you have to ask \u201cis that egg too old?\u201d then it definitely is and will make your entire tract fall off; a beer can pyramid will make your flat smell like a bucket of decomposing swim bladders. But mainly: you know all those annoying, pointless Study Skills tutorial things in first year? The ones you bin off so you can get that essential 11th hour of sleep? Go to them. Because if you don\u2019t, three days before your graduation ceremony you\u2019ll be told you failed Study Skills in 1st year and therefore haven\u2019t actually graduated at all.

I wish I\u2019d known that white wine doesn\u2019t remove red and that - impulsive and blind - I had the capacity to hurt people, so to take a little more care. <strong>Amy Liptrot</strong></p> <h2>I wish I\u2019d known... to avoid the rugby team</h2> <p>In my first term at university, I went along to the rugby team\u2019s welcome party \u2013 not because I wanted to play rugby, at all, but because there were free drinks. This led to a misunderstanding about my banter tolerance levels, and so I got thrown in a pond, in front of my entire year group, in my underwear, in September. In one sense this was a compliment, I guess? But I do feel it set back my attempts to cultivate an image of literary hedonism: I wanted to be offered new and exciting drugs (which is to say, any drugs at all) by attractive women, not pints of snakebite and black by a prop forward. Nice lads, in their own way, the rugby team, but if I could do it all again, I\u2019d definitely keep them at a respectful distance. Also, buy some new pants. <strong>Archie Bland</strong></p> <h2>I wish I\u2019d known<strong>\u2026 nothing!</strong></h2> <p>There\u2019s loads I could list here: you should try revising for at least one exam before 6am the night before; ordering the novelty chocolate spread pizza never ends well; don\u2019t spend two years pining over someone who just isn\u2019t interested, m8. But actually there\u2019s nothing I know now that I wish I\u2019d known as a student. Because uni isn\u2019t where you go to learn about statistical methods in psychology; it\u2019s where you learn how to survive on rice and ketchup, and grow fungal colonies on your bathroom mat. It\u2019s where you might find out what being utterly heartbroken feels like, and how many bottles of cheap red wine it takes to cure it. It will be scary and thrilling and emotional and quite possibly the best time of your life. Believe me: the last thing you need is someone older and wiser getting in the way of that. <strong>Tim Jonze</strong></p>",
  "<p>A far-reaching global trade deal being negotiated in secret could threaten the goals of the Paris climate deal by making it harder for governments to favour clean energy over fossil fuels, a leak of the latest negotiating text shows.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2015/jun/03/wikileaks-documents-trade-in-services-agreement\">controversial</a> Trade in Services Agreement (Tisa) aims to liberalise trade between the EU and 22 countries across the global services sector, which employs tens of millions in Europe alone.</p> <p>But a new EU text seen by the Guardian would oblige signatories to work towards \u201cenergy neutrality\u201d between renewable energy and fossil fuel power, although amendments proposed by the EU would exempt nuclear power from this rule.</p> <p>The document, marked \u201climited distribution \u2013 for Tisa participants only\u201d, would also force member states to legislate against \u201canti-competitive conduct\u201d and \u201cmarket distortions\u201d in energy-related services. This is viewed by campaigners as code for state support for clean power sectors, such as wind and solar.</p> <p> A right to regulate is explicitly mentioned in the paper, but governments would first have to prove the necessity for regulations that legally constrain multinationals.</p> <p> The same clause was used in the World Trade Organisation\u2019s Gatt and Gats treaties which entered into force in 1995, and led to 44 complaints by multinationals via their governments. Of these, 43 were upheld.</p> <p>Susan Cohen Jehoram, a spokeswoman for Greenpeace, told the Guardian: \u201cWe fear the same thing will happen with Tisa but on a much larger scale, when legislation is proposed to keep temperature rises to 1.5C [above pre-industrial levels, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/dec/12/paris-climate-deal-key-points\">as agreed at the Paris climate summit</a>].</p> <p>\u201cIf we want to reach that target, governments will need a toolbox of measures that can give incentives to cleaner energy. Tisa, like the proposed TTIP and Ceta trade agreements, would increase the power of multinationals to prevent governments taking desperately needed measures to decrease CO2 levels.\u201d<br></p> <p> The Paris climate agreement called for \u201cmaking finance flows consistent with a pathway to low greenhouse gas emissions\u201d but the deregulatory thrust of the negotiating text, which was obtained by Greenpeace Netherlands, seems to run counter to this.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/jul/18/un-criticises-uk-and-german-for-betraying-the-spirit-of-the-paris-climate-deal\">UN criticises UK and Germany for betraying Paris climate deal</a> </p> </aside>  <p> Its energy annex says that the trade rules will apply to all legislative measures covering power generation services, \u201cwhether the energy source is renewable or non-renewable\u201d.</p> <p> It also contains a \u201cstandstill\u201d clause freezing in perpetuity the high watermark of liberalisation in certain sectors, and a \u201cratchet\u201d clause to stop countries reintroducing trade barriers that had been previously removed.

David Davis, the minister for Brexit, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jul/14/global-bilateral-trade-deals-bigger-eu-single-market-david-davis\">recently described</a> the similar <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/06/transatlantic-trade-partnership-ttip-canada-eu\">Ceta trade agreement with Canada</a> as his preferred model for a trade arrangement with the EU.</p> <p> Gardiner said: \u201cThe British people have voted to come out of the European Union to preserve the principle of parliamentary sovereignty, it cannot be right then that secret trade deals are currently being conducted entirely outside the scrutiny of national parliaments and law-makers.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe structure of such deals are like a lobster pot \u2013 once you have gone through and given power to the commercial interest it is no longer possible to recapture democratic control.

However, the issue that comes up most in Fayle\u2019s experience as an IRO is the misuse of <a href=\"http://www.childrenslegalcentre.com/index.php?page=LocalAuthoritySupportforChildrenandFamilies_lookedafterchildren\">section 20 of the Children Act 1989</a>, where children are accommodated with parental consent. </p> <p> Now subject to considerable judicial criticism \u2013 section 20 accommodation does not require any oversight by the courts, neither children or parents are entitled to free legal advice or representation, and as a result, children have languished in care for years \u2013 Fayle says \u201cthe point is, if IROs were doing their job properly, this [misuse] would be, if not eliminated, then radically reduced\u201d.</p> <p> If an IRO doesn\u2019t make use of their powers to hold councils to account, what\u2019s the result?</p> <p>\u201cIt leaves children without an essential protection intended by parliament,\u201d says Fayle \u2013 a problem also noted by judges in cases including <a href=\"http://www.bailii.org/cgi-bin/format.cgi?doc=/ew/cases/EWFC/OJ/2014/B217.html&amp;query=(%22independent+reviewing+officer%22))\">this one</a>, which deplores the detriment to an already vulnerable child of an IRO failing to bring sufficiently rigorous or independent scrutiny to a local authority care plan that was severely lacking.</p> <p> There is another problem caused by the \u201cin-house\u201d employment of IROs: confidence in the system is eroded. When IROs are dependent for their paycheck on the very local authority they are meant to be holding to account, it\u2019s hardly surprising that, whether they do this well or not, there is in-built scepticism and mistrust from families with children in care.</p> <p>\u201cI didn\u2019t initially know what an IRO did and believed them to be entirely independent and separate,\u201d says one mother with experience of the care system. \u201cI got a shock when I overheard her chatting to my child\u2019s social worker about stuff going on in \u2018the office\u2019 and later found out they sat behind each other at work. I\u2019ve left meetings hearing them talk about nights out together; it was all just a bit too matey and didn\u2019t feel right, or respectful. How can you properly challenge a friend you\u2019ll be out with later? I found this IRO to be heavily on the side of the local authority. When she asked questions at all she was quite apologetic about it. If I challenged her in a meeting she would get aggressive and threaten to ask me to leave.\u201d</p> <p> A NAIRO survey of IROs asked whether they felt they would be able carry out their role better if employed by a separate organisation. The majority \u2013 nearly 80% \u2013 said that on balance, remaining in-house with the resulting familiarity with that council\u2019s personnel and processes outweighed the psychological and economic independence of being employed by an outside organisation. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/social-care-network/2016/apr/14/cuts-foster-carers-struggle-ends-meet-allowances\">Short-sighted cuts mean foster carers are struggling to make ends meet</a> </p> </aside>  <p>That view is backed up in research by Prof Jonathan Dickens at the University of East Anglia, which found just a quarter of employed, and 30% of self-employed, IROs <a href=\"https://www.uea.ac.uk/documents/3437903/0/Care+Planning+and+IROs+UEA+Oct+2015.pdf/e9236f71-d2db-46bc-95ec-884eeef1471d\">believed their service should be separated from the local authority</a> (pdf). Even fewer \u2013 18% \u2013 of social work team managers, whom IROs are required to hold to account, wanted the service to have institutional independence.</p> <p> But doubts remain from IROs who have experienced pushback when they have sought to challenge on behalf of a child. </p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a very difficult balance to strike between working cooperatively with the local authority and colluding with them,\u201d says independent social worker Maggie Siviter, who has worked as an IRO. \u201cIt\u2019s often a fraught process. IROs are outnumbered within the larger children\u2019s services, whose managers don\u2019t want to be challenged when they are making decisions based on resources and fieldwork priorities. I have been bullied as an IRO to withdraw my challenge, I\u2019ve seen other IROs named and shamed in senior management team meetings, and as an IRO manager I\u2019ve been told to \u2018remind your IROs whose logo is at the top of their payslips\u2019.\u201d</p> <p> For the particular children these IROs were responsible for, the independent oversight they were entitled to failed to happen in the way it should have. But in principle, is independence possible for IROs who are employed in-house, at a time when care applications are going through the roof and ever more vulnerable children must therefore rely on them? </p> <p>\u201cI think some local authorities try very hard to give IROs independence but it\u2019s still very difficult,\u201d says Fayle at NAIRO, which has just developed a toolkit to support good practice including a \u201chealth check\u201d to assess quality of service. \u201cIROs know only too well how terribly stretched and overworked their children\u2019s social work colleagues are and it\u2019s hard not to be sympathetic to their position, so it makes it harder to challenge and criticise in the way a Cafcass officer from outside the local authority might. </p> <p>\u201cBut the more important thing is the culture. Is this an organisation that really wants to hear the views of IROs and take them seriously, or are they seen as a bit of a nuisance?\u201d </p> <p><strong><a href=\"https://register.theguardian.com/social-care/\">Join the Social Care Network</a> to read more pieces like this.

  "<p>It\u2019s a question that has bothered gamers \u2013 and pet lovers \u2013 for many years. Exactly what is the cutest animal ever to appear in video game form? Certainly pixellated critters have been a staple protagonist for game designers since Donkey Kong first stamped his way up the building in Nintendo\u2019s 1981 arcade classic. </p> <p>Since then, as in the world of animated movies, there have been many hundreds of anthropomorphised heroes \u2013 with designers relying heavily on our instinctual protective love of small animals with gigantic eyes. </p> <p>Here then, are the 18 cutest examples in video game history. Feel free to add your own favourites in the comments.</p> <h2>18.

Ecco could sing to his friends and do backflips out of the water, providing an experience that was surprisingly calming <em>and</em> authentic \u2013 apart from that whole thing about him discovering Atlantis and foiling an extraterrestrial invasion plot. </p> <h2><strong>17.

Of course, Rare went with Diddy Kong. Why wouldn\u2019t they? A legend was born. </p> <h2><strong>16.

This lovable resident of the Apature Lab has been taken by canny merchandisers and turned into plushes, cookie jars, keyrings... and pants, which is totally bizarre for a thing that is just a large box. No one feels this way about the crates in Zelda or Crash Bandicoot, do they? Well, those don\u2019t have big, lovely hearts on them, of course. The Weighted Companion Cube, on the other hand, is iconic \u2013 and, continually destroyed by evil computer GlaDOS, it\u2019s a great joke about emotional attachment in video games.</p> <h2><strong>12.

However, we have too many dogs in this list, so let\u2019s hear it for Lammy, the anxious lamb guitarist who stars in the excellent sequel. Once again designer Masaya Matsuura and artist Rodney Alan Greenblat combined to fill their game with kooky characters and bizarre rhythm action challenges, but nothing outshone Lammy, with her red hair, on-point 1990s fashions and tendency to panic. </p> <h2><strong>11. Amaterasu (Okami)</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9c988d4222ef43c1a14f0b4e317d64f4f62a6602\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9c988d4222ef43c1a14f0b4e317d64f4f62a6602/775_836_2570_1542/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Amaterasu the god, who comes to Earth in the form of a super cute wolf, as any sensible deity would\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Amaterasu the god, who comes to Earth in the form of a super cute wolf, as any sensible deity would</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Capcom</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Proof that a game protagonist doesn\u2019t have to be a grizzled, gruff dude with a beard to be compelling, Amaterasu is the fluffiest incarnation of a god that this industry has ever imagined. The game\u2019s beautiful aesthetic, designed to resemble Japanese ink illustration, manages to convey both the serious godlike persona of Amaterasu and the playful nature of the wolf body she inhabits. Bonus points for her even-cuter baby wolflet, Chibiterasu, in the DS-only sequel Okamiden.</p> <h2><strong>10. Missile (Ghost Trick)</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"45593aad1424e33252a9102a6da3fb16c6ea1117\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/45593aad1424e33252a9102a6da3fb16c6ea1117/0_947_4000_2400/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Missile \u2013 the best name you can possibly give to a supernatural Pomeranian\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Missile \u2013 the best name you can possibly give to a supernatural Pomeranian</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Capcom</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Do ghosts have pets? That is the question that haunts Capcom\u2019s supernatural adventure, in which the player takes control of a spectre trying to save living people. Missile starts off as just another dog \u2013 a very loud, slightly annoying Pomeranian that really wants to help, but ends up being shot. Pretty dark stuff, but then he comes back as a ghost and helps you out in your quest to do supernatural good deeds. Missile also turns up in Ace Attorney, but he\u2019s not dead in that game, so not quite as cute. This is why all ghosts should have pets. </p> <h2><strong>9.

Not quite a chicken, not quite a horse, would probably taste delicious but that\u2019s a bit weird and let\u2019s not go there. You won\u2019t find a bird this accommodating in real life, willing to carry your overburdened butt into battle and back, as well as being used for races, breeding and inventory management. But they\u2019re so <em>cute</em>. Especially the fat ones, which can store extra stuff inside their big, yellow bellies. Just don\u2019t ask how, it\u2019s probably gross.</p> <h2><strong>8. Marshal (Animal Crossing)</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6a5dda04f07f79aad8cbe8f95c57d0cee582b39c\"> <img src=\"https://uploads.guim.co.uk/2016/09/20/giphy-1-compressor.gif\" alt=\"Marshal\" width=\"480\" height=\"270\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>The. Best. Animal Crossing. Villager. Hands. Down. Ever. Marshal is a grumpy but adorable little squirrel-dude who\u2019s a total gentleman, and if it were possible and not weird to date Animal Crossing characters, he\u2019d be a smash hit on Tinder. He\u2019s also surprisingly flirty for a character in a sweet, childlike game, always telling you that you look nice and turning up to your house unexpectedly \u2026 Obviously if this was real life we\u2019d get a restraining order, but in Animal Crossing, we love this smug, squirrel-faced Lothario.</p> <h2><strong>7.

But still, they\u2019re so cute, when they\u2019re sitting inside a cardboard train or staring right at you while wearing a tiny cat-sized cowboy hat. Even Tubbs, unanimously agreed upon to be the Worst Cat because he eats all the food, is cute. He just wants to be your friend (so he can eat all your food).</p> <h2><strong>5.

The lead character, AiAi, is the game\u2019s charming focus, with his cow\u2019s lick hair, giant ears and evident joy at navigating a series of perilous platform worlds in a giant hamster ball.</p> <h2><strong>4.

Kirby has a mouth and a solid personality; a Waddle Dee is mouthless and voiceless and his main personality trait seems to be \u201csometimes has an umbrella\u201d. Occasionally, the Waddle Dees work for series antagonist King Dedede, but usually they waddle around the overworld being gorgeous. Kirby has probably inhaled hundreds of them throughout his adventures, and that\u2019s why Kirby, although cute, is also the worst.</p> <h2><strong>2.

  "<h2>Alan Parker, director</h2> <p>I was offered a chance to film Les Mis\u00e9rables in the late 80s, but I chose The Commitments instead. After <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/jan/24/alan-parker-bugsy-malone-bafta\">making several films</a> in America, I had a yearning to do something closer to home and to my working-class roots. Dublin\u2019s Northside, where <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/roddydoyle\">Roddy Doyle</a>\u2019s novel was set, closely resembled the Islington of the 1960s where I grew up. Everyone I knew wanted to be in a band to escape the world we found ourselves in.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/oct/13/how-we-made-bugsy-malone-jodie-foster-scott-baio-alan-parker\">How we made Bugsy Malone</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Roddy couldn\u2019t get his original screenplay made, so <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/observer/screen/story/0,6903,706271,00.html\">Dick Clement and Ian La Frenais</a> restructured it, fleshing out the humour. The script changed again when we were casting the film, as we heard the lines mangled a thousand times in auditions and improved them. When I arrived in Dublin, we immediately auditioned 65 bands and spent the next few months on a lengthy pub crawl as we trawled upstairs performance spaces to make sure we\u2019d seen everybody \u2013 not an onerous task.</p> <p>Robert Arkins auditioned for the roles of manager Jimmy Rabbitte and singer Deco Cuffe. But when Andrew Strong came in quite late, he nailed the Deco part. He had extraordinary confidence for a 16-year-old. So I cast Robert as Jimmy, which is the more difficult part from an acting perspective, as he\u2019s the glue that holds the whole film together.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KoLP3AArnEI\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/KoLP3AArnEI?start=5&wmode=opaque&feature=oembed&start=5\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KoLP3AArnEI\">Watch Treat Her Right from The Commitments on YouTube</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>We had an unusually long five-week rehearsal period, with dramatic rehearsals in the mornings and musical ones in the afternoons. Because we were so well prepared, the shoot ran smoothly. When you\u2019re filming music, it lifts everyone. The cast were tantrum-free, and every day was a joy. But because most of the actors were working musicians \u2013 or more often out-of-work musicians \u2013 they lived rather nomadic, dubious lifestyles. None of them had phones; some relied on a granny taking messages. We gave them all mobiles \u2013 a novelty in 1990 \u2013 so we could keep tabs on them.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The Dublin screening was the best we had anywhere in the world. I never met an Irish person who didn\u2019t like it</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The dramatic scenes were filmed conventionally in a disciplined manner, but the musical sequences were shot in a grittier, looser, documentary style. We used a new technique of shooting music, which allowed me to play backing tracks loudly but shoot live vocals. Consequently, we did not have to rely on vocal miming \u2013 the norm for music filming. We used multiple cameras to take advantage of the spontaneity of the moment; when I let the cast fly, they improvised like crazy, breaking the record for the most swearwords used in a film. It got an R-rating in the US \u2013 maybe why it only made $15m on first release. But the Dublin screening was the best we had anywhere in the world. I never met an Irish person who didn\u2019t like it.</p> <h2>Robert Arkins, actor</h2> <p>I wasn\u2019t a soul or Motown fan \u2013 they felt so old in the 80s. The band I sang in at the time were trying to do something modern: cross electronic music with hard guitars. My keyboard player\u2019s brother\u2019s girlfriend was an actor, and recommended us to her agent, who put us in touch with the casting people for The Commitments. The first time we went to the office, everyone in the band turned to me: \u201cWho\u2019s going first?\u201d I\u2019m like: \u201cWhy are you asking me?\u201d But the casting people must have spotted that I was the leader. Maybe that\u2019s why I got the part of Jimmy.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"72cb9705193384232818c5237d33688e62b0b925\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/72cb9705193384232818c5237d33688e62b0b925/0_186_2238_2795/801.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018The shoot was three months long, working God knows how many hours\u2019 \u2026 Robert Arkins as Jimmy Rabbitte.\" width=\"801\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018The shoot was three months long, working God knows how many hours\u2019 \u2026 Robert Arkins as Jimmy Rabbitte.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Moviestore/Rex Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Alan seemed to leave me alone in rehearsals, unlike some of the others, like Andrew Strong, who got extra attention. Maybe he was treating me with kid gloves, because he thought I couldn\u2019t handle being pushed.</p> <p>The shoot was three months solid, one day off a week, and working God knows how many hours. There was a bit of messing about because we were bored. Sometimes the assistant directors had a nightmare finding us \u2013 or got into trouble for not being able to.</p> <p>The best thing that happened was when Joey the Lips comes down the lane on his motorbike. Johnny Murphy, who plays Joey, couldn\u2019t drive that bike for anything and forgot to take his hand off the throttle; it went smash into the wall. And that stayed in. We were in stitches. No matter how many lessons he got, he still couldn\u2019t get to grips with that Honda 50.</p> <p>I had no idea the acclaim would go on for years. I could have done with some coaching, some help. Walking down the street, being yourself: it took that away from you overnight. I think some people think we were a real band, which is maybe why people sometimes ask: \u201cWhere are they now?\u201d I take offence at that. Everyone in The Commitments gave their best.</p> <p>It\u2019s still the No 1 Irish film ever made \u2013 though when you say Irish, it was made by the British and funded by Americans. It definitely has an English sense of comedy, because of Clement and La Frenais. The jokes are soft \u2013 they\u2019re not aggressive. But the Irish totally took it on board. When we did the 20th anniversary concert, we played on the same day Ireland beat England at rugby, so everyone was half-cut and euphoric. Something working class like that had never happened before in Irish film. It was all fucking leprechauns. The Commitments put Ireland and Dubliners on the world stage.</p> <p>\u2022 The Commitments 25th anniversary edition is out on DVD and Blu-Ray.</p>",
  "<p>Lamp lighters once performed a vital service for Londoners. Every evening as dusk fell they lit the gas lamps that illuminated the city\u2019s shadowy streets, returning just before dawn to extinguish the flames.

Another <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://uk.businessinsider.com/deloitte-review-jobs-london-risk-of-automation-2016-3\">report by Deloitte</a> found that in London, 29% of admin and support services jobs, and a whopping 72% of transport and storage roles, are at \u201chigh risk\u201d of automation.</p> <p>However, <a href=\"https://www.forrester.com/report/The+Future+Of+Jobs+2025+Working+Side+By+Side+With+Robots/-/E-RES119861\">a report Forrester published last year</a> was less pessimistic about people\u2019s future employment prospects, suggesting that only 9.1 million US jobs will be automated by 2025. Robinson is more inclined to believe Forrester\u2019s estimate. \u201cIt\u2019s inarguable that as technology develops, it will automate certain tasks. But \u2018tasks\u2019 are very different to \u2018jobs\u2019. I also think some reports are hugely optimistic about what technology will be able to accomplish in [the] future.\u201d</p> <p>If Google or another tech giant does eventually manage to create an artificial general intelligence that can successfully perform any task a human can, the job losses would dwarf anything we\u2019ve seen before \u2013 and not only among the 1.5 million people employed by local government in England. A universal basic income, which would provide everyone with enough money to maintain a decent standard of living, is often cited as a solution to this problem. But in the medium term we might find robots still need our help; that there are things we simply do better than machines.</p> <p>For example, humans working cooperatively with machines are generally regarded as the strongest chess-playing entities, each drawing upon their skills to beat opponents.

  "<p>No one expects a schools inquisition.

It seems a common trick of grammar school supporters to dismiss views on the matter from anybody who did not attend a comprehensive. I\u2019m an annoyance to them, because I did.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/sep/12/theresa-may-grammar-schools-maidenhead\">Dear Theresa May, here\u2019s what grammar schools did to my family | John O\u2019Farrell</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cLaura, which comp did you attend? A well-performing one?\u201d a Ukip person asked me on Twitter.</p> <p>The truth is my school wasn\u2019t good, and that\u2019s why it was closed in 2010 and the pupils transferred to one with <a href=\"http://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/local-news/wade-deacon-widnes-celebrates-another-11800784\" title=\"\">results so good</a> they almost defy logic. The Ukip man complained his own school was no good. But when I looked it up, I found it had a new headteacher and is improving rapidly.</p> <p>People forget there has been a revolution in school management since the 2000s. Inspections are fierce, targets robust; regional schools commissioners breathe down headteachers\u2019 necks. If school leaders mess up, the management is changed.</p> <p>Nicky Morgan even introduced legislation requiring the education secretary to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2015/nov/17/nicky-morgan-steal-schools-church-conservative-law\" title=\"\">take over failing schools</a>. Turning backs is no longer an option.</p> <p>Any increase in selective schools will undermine these takeover systems at precisely the point when they need time in order to bed in.</p> <p>Let\u2019s be clear. Comprehensives educate most children in this country. Hundreds of thousands of kids get top grades in them every year and go on to top universities. And why wouldn\u2019t they? Lower-attaining kids can\u2019t sap cleverness out of their peers simply by being in the same building.</p> <p>Grammar schools tend not to receive \u201cfail\u201d grades. Their advantaged intake and greater ability to hire and keep experienced teachers helps with that. But non-selective schools near them do get these grades, at higher rates than in comprehensive areas.</p> <p>Opening new grammars therefore could lead to more good schools, but is also likely to lead to more failures \u2013 and turning them around is much tougher.</p> <p>So, here\u2019s a provocative idea. If we are thinking of allowing more selection in schools, why not give that opportunity to failing ones first? Allow them to pick pupils by ability for five years and then, once they have sucked in all the middle-class parents and experienced teachers, and results have shot up \u2013 things we know happen in grammar schools \u2013 they will be rated good, and we can reopen their doors to all. Selection could be the reset button against underperformance. Parents wouldn\u2019t have to choose the school. The children would take the 11-plus and be allocated a school place.</p> <p>Parents don\u2019t choose secondary moderns either, by and large, and yet apparently it\u2019s OK to make kids go to one if they don\u2019t pass the 11-plus.</p> <p>The idea is designed to provoke, of course. But it highlights how the Conservative party, and broader society, seem to have different values for children of different abilities. Risking harm to the education of bright kids to make the system better is a no-no to them. But knocking the poor-but-average kids seems to be less of a concern.

Since January, Khorsandi has been president of the <a href=\"https://humanism.org.uk/\" title=\"\">British Humanist Association</a>, which campaigns for high-quality sex and relationships education (SRE) to be made statutory. For her it\u2019s the ubiquity of online porn that makes proper education so critical.</p> <p>\u201cWe have to be much more open about what we talk about and really understand the difference between fantasy and reality,\u201d she says. \u201cEvery fantasy, every kink between consenting adults is fine, but I don\u2019t like the idea of any teenager watching pornography and not having an outlet to talk about what they\u2019ve seen.</p> <p>\u201cA very young friend told me when she first started sex she just started acting out porn stuff because she thought that\u2019s what sex was meant to be. It\u2019s said so often, but there are so many pressures on kids these days and they\u2019re subjected to so much damaging nonsense on the internet, on TV, on their phones. If we don\u2019t give them all the information they need to stay healthy and happy and safe, we\u2019re letting them down.\u201d</p> <p>The last Labour government had been set to make personal, social, health, and economic education (PSHE) \u2013 which includes SRE \u2013 statutory, but dropped the plan to get its schools bill passed before the 2010 election. After that Michael Gove and Nicky Morgan rejected calls for statutory PSHE, most recently in February this year. Last week the new education secretary, Justine Greening, told the education select committee she was looking at the possibility, but was yet to reach a formal view. Figures published by the Department for Education last month reveal a 29% drop in teaching time given to PSHE in English secondary schools between 2011 and 2015.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/video/2015/oct/19/sex-lads-grey-areas-uk-universities-consent-rape-sexual-assault-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/4ddma\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2391724\"            data-video-name=\"Sex, lads and grey areas: what's going on at UK universities? \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"guardian.co.uk\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-5624cfe1e4b0229634d39d7a\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2015/10/19/151019LadsConsent_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2015/10/19/151019LadsConsent_large.3gp\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2015/10/19/151019LadsConsent.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2015/10/19/151019LadsConsent_small.3gp\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2015/10/19/151019LadsConsent_synd_768k_vp8.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/video/2015/oct/19/sex-lads-grey-areas-uk-universities-consent-rape-sexual-assault-video\">Sex, lads and grey areas: what\u2019s going on at UK universities? \u2013 video (October 2015)</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>\u201cThe emotions around sex need to be talked about in a safe place and I can\u2019t think of a safer place than school,\u201d says Khorsandi, mother to Cassius, nine, and&#xa0;Genevieve, three. \u201cWe need to let our guard down and be less prudish.

Lucid dreams can be frustratingly brief, Clower says. \u201cEvery now and then, I will hit a brick wall when brainstorming, mostly solutions too intricate or complex work problems \u2026 Those can be a bit frustrating because I am racing during the dream to arrive at a solution because I know that the time is precious.\u201d<br></p> <p>With <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/small-business-network/2015/oct/09/awake-3am-entrepreneurs-biphasic-sleep-insomnia\">many small business owners already struggling to get a good night\u2019s sleep</a>, some may be concerned that being \u201cawake\u201d in their dreams will take a toll on their mental alertness during the day.<br></p> <p>According to Stephen LaBerge, psychophysiologist and a leader in the scientific study of lucid dreaming, the experience is usually just as restful as non-lucid dreaming. Indeed, studies by the neuropsychologists <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2014/apr/27/mysteries-lucid-dreaming-brain-consciousness-research\">Ursula Voss and Martin Dresler</a> have shown that brain activity while lucid dreaming is similar to the regular <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapid_eye_movement_sleep\" rel=\"nofollow\">REM</a> (rapid eye movement) sleep during which we all dream.<br></p> <p>However, in his bestselling book <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Exploring-World-Dreams-Stephen-LaBerge/dp/034537410X\" rel=\"nofollow\">Exploring the World of Lucid Dreaming</a>, LaBerge writes that how tired you feel after a dream depends on what you did in the dream. For example, Clower admits that while most mornings she wakes up feeling refreshed, a night of intense problem-solving while lucid dreaming can sometimes mean she is mentally exhausted the next day.<br></p> <p>Lucid dreaming can have more than just a psychological effect on practitioners. Erlacher has found that mentally practising an activity during dreams can even improve physical skills. In one small study, published in the journal Sport Psychologist in 2010, lucid dreamers were asked to toss coins into coffee cups before bed and then dream about themselves practising that night. In the morning, when asked to toss coins again, the lucid dreamers who <a href=\"http://journals.humankinetics.com/doi/abs/10.1123/tsp.24.2.157\" rel=\"nofollow\">successfully practised while dreaming were more accurate</a>, compared with those who failed to practise and a control group of non-lucid dreamers.<br></p> <p>Choreographer Jade Shaw, who founded small business <a href=\"http://parkourdance.co.uk/\" rel=\"nofollow\">ParkourDance</a> in 2012 after brainstorming the idea during a lucid dream, says she has experienced this first hand. She claims that after practising aerial cartwheels in a dream state she felt it was easier to perfect the movement while awake. Although she admits she couldn\u2019t be sure what level of impact her lucid dream activity really had on her performance.<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"9bde308f9d521109ef6ccbd20eb895b64e4c85e7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9bde308f9d521109ef6ccbd20eb895b64e4c85e7/0_52_864_1080/800.jpg\" alt=\"woman dancing\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Choreographer Jade Shaw says brainstorming in a lucid dream helped her to come up with the idea for her dance company.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Lydia Polzer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There are limitations to what entrepreneurs can do in a lucid dream. Erlacher says: \u201cA lucid dream will not help you to learn another language if you have never heard it before. You have to have some experience with the things you practise in your dreams. It\u2019s not a miracle.\u201d<br></p> <p>But before small business owners start thinking they have a new, handy way to rehearse an important pitch or come up with an invention, be warned; learning how to get lucid in a dream is not easy, it takes time, effort and a little luck.<br></p> <p>Scientists such as LaBerge devised techniques to induce lucid dreams, most notably the Mild technique (mnemonic induction of lucid dreams). This involves improving dream recall \u2013 for example, by keeping a dream journal, repeatedly questioning whether you are awake or dreaming, regular affirmations to get lucid and visualisations before sleeping. And a <a href=\"http://mashable.com/2013/11/17/remee-lucid-dreaming/\" rel=\"nofollow\">plethora of gadgets</a> are now available claiming to help get users to that state while asleep.<br></p> <p>Sadly, Erlacher says that there is no foolproof way to induce lucid dreams. In fact,<a href=\"http://www.lucidity.com/SleepAndCognition.html\" rel=\"nofollow\"> only about 20% of the population</a> claim to have lucid dreams once a month or more. He says that most people will have to train for one to two months for their first lucid dream using an induction technique.<br></p> <p>\u201cIf you want to have more lucid dreams you have to continue with your training,\u201d says Erlacher. \u201cThat\u2019s the major obstacle in lucid dream research, to find reliable, easy to apply techniques to induce lucid dreams.\u201d<br></p> <p><strong>Sign up to become a member of the Guardian Small Business Network </strong><a href=\"https://register.theguardian.com/small-business/\"><strong>here</strong></a><strong> for more advice, insight and best practice direct to your inbox.</strong></p>",

Less than three months into her tenure, Raggi has faced the resignations of four top officials, an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/02/romes-reform-minded-mayor-under-pressure-to-bin-rubbish-tsar\">ongoing scandal about the sanitation chief</a> she chose to clean up the city, and accusations of being a hapless tool of party leaders.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0eae19bcd6865a7960d4b0ea9d11c4e0b9dea40a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0eae19bcd6865a7960d4b0ea9d11c4e0b9dea40a/0_102_3072_1843/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Five Star Movement supporters in Rome celebrate Raggi\u2019s election on 20 June.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Five Star Movement supporters in Rome celebrate Raggi\u2019s election on 20 June.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alessandro Di Meo/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The ensuing chaos is having ripple effects across the Italian political establishment and could even affect <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/06/matteo-renzi-italy-referendum-banks-brexit\">a critical referendum this autumn</a>, the outcome of which will determine the future of the prime minister, Matteo Renzi. <br></p> <p>The turn of events has not surprised veteran watchers of Rome\u2019s notoriously tumultuous politics.</p> <p>\u201cThe only surprising thing is that it has happened so soon,\u201d said Giovanni Orsina, a professor of contemporary history at LUISS University in Rome. \u201cIt is an extremely difficult situation. The city is on its knees. The public services don\u2019t work \u2013 notably rubbish collection and public transport \u2013 and the lobbies of those services are so strong that it would take a very powerful political force to fix them, which she is not.\u201d </p> <p>When Raggi was elected, it was seen as a breakthrough for the anti-establishment M5S, a Eurosceptic political party created by the satirist Beppe Grillo in 2009 that espouses direct democracy and transparency. The <em>Cinque Stelle</em>, as it is known in Italy, has become the country\u2019s second most popular party thanks to a knack for tapping into Italians\u2019 anger over the status quo. <br></p> <p>Grillo, an admirer of Ukip\u2019s Nigel Farage, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jun/02/corruption-gripes-help-five-star-movement-top-italy-local-election-polls\">routinely rails against everything</a>, from corruption to establishment politicians\u2019 cosy ties with big business, and M5S politicians often portray themselves as above reproach because of the party\u2019s tough internal anti-corruption rules.</p> <p>The Raggi victory was significant because it was seen as a test of whether the M5S could move beyond its role as a protest party and actually govern.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8550bf129fce4b81d120985b3b86e3c1a5d1bb34\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8550bf129fce4b81d120985b3b86e3c1a5d1bb34/0_151_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tourists stand next to an overflowing bin in Rome\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tourists stand next to an overflowing bin in Rome. Rubbish collection is a major headache for Raggi\u2019s administration.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andreas Solaro/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p> So far, the verdict seems to be \u201cno\u201d and the political ruptures have fanned fears that a planned investment in the public transport system could be delayed because Raggi does not have a budget chief in place. Romans are also still awaiting a final verdict on whether Raggi will support <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/dec/15/rome-olympic-bid-corruption-recession-matteo-renzi\">Rome\u2019s bid for the 2024 Olympics</a>, which she said she opposed during the campaign. Given the M5S\u2019s stated commitment to public transport and its opposition to big, unwieldy projects, both issues are significant.</p> <p>The big question now is whether or not Raggi\u2019s problems in Rome will diminish the reputation of the M5S nationally, with just weeks to go before the referendum on constitutional reform. Renzi says the reforms will make it easier to pass legislation by dramatically restricting the powers of the senate, a major source of political gridlock. He has vowed to resign if he loses the referendum, which in turn could force Italy\u2019s president to dissolve the current parliament and call a new election.</p> <p>With Italy\u2019s right in disarray, the biggest threat to Renzi\u2019s Democratic party is the M5S. For months, the party has been trying to portray itself as a viable alternative to Renzi, but Raggi\u2019s travails could lead Italians to wonder whether it is ready to lead the country.</p> <p>\u201cThey don\u2019t even have anyone in charge of finance in Rome. Yet they want to be in charge of a country with \u20ac2.5tn (\u00a32.1tn) in debt? There is a huge issue of credibility at stake,\u201d said Wolfango Piccoli, the co-president of Teneo Intelligence in London.</p> <p>Raggi\u2019s problems started early on, when she decided to appoint officials who served under Gianni Alemanno, a previous mayor and a rightwinger. This angered left-leaning supporters, confirming their suspicion that Raggi \u2013 who has portrayed herself as non-ideological \u2013 had ties to Rome\u2019s right. When it emerged that her chief of staff would be earning about \u20ac200,000 (\u00a3170,000) \u2013 a figure far exceeding recommendations for the role \u2013 she was forced to sack the official, prompting several other high-profile resignations. </p> <p>The most controversial decision has centred on her choice of person to clean up the city, Paola Muraro, who had previously been paid hundreds of thousands of euros as a consultant for the city\u2019s rubbish collection agency. Raggi learned in July that prosecutors were examining Muraro\u2019s record, but she has nevertheless stood by her appointment, and Muraro has denied all allegations of impropriety. <br></p> <p>The controversy has ensnared another M5S politician, Luigi Di Maio, who was alerted about the Muraro investigation by Raggi but never acted on it, contrary to the spirit of internal M5S rules. The 30-year-old vic- president of parliament, a wunderkind of the M5S, had been considered a possible rival to Renzi.<br></p> <p>Now Raggi is fighting back. In a <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/virginia.raggi.m5sroma/videos/vb.469144566601331/642333055949147/?type=2&amp;theater\">Facebook post</a> this month, she defended Muraro and made a defiant declaration.</p> <p>\u201cNot a day has passed without attacks, polemic and accusations. I have broad shoulders. It is not a problem for me,\u201d she said.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"467f0dd9f34b78c8b1da26c7fead686b29380ec2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/467f0dd9f34b78c8b1da26c7fead686b29380ec2/0_123_3072_1844/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Virginia Raggi at a press conference in June.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Virginia Raggi at a press conference in June.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alessandro Di Meo/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Raggi\u2019s defenders say the mayor still has some powerful political allies: Romans themselves. While Raggi has been the focus of negative headlines almost every day, Romans seem willing to give her more time, said Francesco Galietti, the founder of Policy Sonar in Rome.</p> <p>M5S\u2019s attempt to use municipal elections to prove its credentials has, however, undoubtedly taken a hit, much to the delight of Renzi. But the prime minister is not out of the woods yet, and Raggi can still turn things around.</p> <p>\u201cRomans are very angry at the previous administrations and they are very patient. They are ready to wait for a few months, so if they can start solving some problems of the city and if she does it, all this will be forgotten,\u201d Orsina said. \u201cBut how can she do that if she doesn\u2019t have a viable group of people around her? I wouldn\u2019t bet on that but it is possible.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>You don\u2019t build communities up by putting people down. Structural changes to the economy have resulted in entire communities being left without work and often without adequate social and economic infrastructure. </p> <p>We see manufacturing jobs disappearing, the loss of jobs in some sectors due to privatisation, and the global quest for ever greater profits by using ever cheaper labour. We have seen a worrying trend towards casualisation and insecure employment and, on the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/grogonomics/2016/sep/20/sure-unemployment-is-down-but-plenty-of-people-would-like-to-work-more\">latest ABS labour force figures</a>, a decline in the total number of monthly hours worked in all jobs.

Living in poverty is not a sickness. Nor is it a crime. Yet we continue to fall into the ideological trap of either pathologising or criminalising people who sin against the dominant moral code by not being \u201cself-reliant\u201d in the marketplace. </p> <p>This is not new. The earlier McClure Report, tabled by Jocelyn Newman in 2000, began from the same premise; that we urgently needed to address the problem of \u201cwelfare dependency\u201d because it, and people\u2019s lives, are seemingly spiralling out of control.</p> <p>It\u2019s time we stopped disguising market failure as a personal failure to participate in the market. For this is where we are starting again, with the current offerings of \u201crevolutionary\u201d vision and \u201cradical\u201d change by social services minister, Christian Porter. By focusing on the supposed failings of the individual, we are missing the bleeding obvious: that there are not enough jobs (and more specifically, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/grogonomics/2016/sep/20/sure-unemployment-is-down-but-plenty-of-people-would-like-to-work-more\">not enough hours!</a>) for those who can work as well as a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/aug/13/axing-clean-energy-supplement-has-barely-caused-a-ripple-but-it-should\">seriously inadequate level of income</a> support for those who cannot. </p> <p>In the same way, the persistence of homelessness is not a failure of individuals to \u201cdo the right thing\u201d and buy a house (or get their parents to pitch in), but rather a failure of the housing market, which is structured in such a way as to be brilliant at providing choice for those at the top, and dazzling as a speculative sport, but lousy at ensuring access to affordable and appropriate accommodation for all.</p> <p>The other trick that is used to mask the failures of the market is to blame social services. In this discursive sleight of hand, the persistence of unemployment and poverty is proof that the services are not working, and that their funding is a waste of public money because <em>they</em> have failed to end homelessness or unemployment or poverty. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/02/labor-shouldnt-support-newstart-cuts-it-would-be-a-moral-and-electoral-mistake\">Labor should not support Newstart cuts. It would be a moral and electoral mistake | Van Badham</a> </p> </aside>  <p>So, the endgame is not even the modest alleviation of poverty, let alone the arresting of inequality. It is the running down of what actually does work or would work as an investment in people and communities, like Gonski, a highly targeted investment in children\u2019s education, focusing on student need rather than sector. Or like Tafe, a national treasure, that on the watch of governments of both sides of politics, has been systematically undermined and gutted. Likewise, community health programmes, community legal aid programmes, social services and justice reinvestment programmes have been either deliberately cut, like the highly successful Youth Connections, or decidedly ignored.</p> <p>Australia does not have a welfare problem. We have a poverty problem and an inequality problem, but you know that these problems are going to be ignored when the dominant discourse focuses our attention on the \u201cwelfare problem.\u201d&#xa0;</p> <p>It is true that providing someone with income support and forgetting about them is not the solution to unemployment. But neither is it the cause of unemployment. In short, it is neither the solution nor the problem. And the problem of unemployment and underemployment, which is a structural rather than a behavioural problem, is not going to be addressed by forcing people to live below the poverty line, which is what we appear to be comfortable with allowing to remain as the status quo, even after the welfare revolution. And in the meantime, we are still eagerly being told that corporations need welfare assistance via tax cuts and concessions.</p> <p>Poverty is not a personal choice. Being a full-time carer, or living with a disability or mental illness, or leaving a violent partner, or being residualised by the labour market, should not result in poverty in a prosperous and progressive country. We should certainly not begrudge the money we spend to make sure that no one is left out or pushed out; that no one is excluded from having a place to call home, a place to work for those who can work (and appropriate income support for those who cannot), a place to learn, and a place to heal. We should not be comfortable with the retrograde notion that charity should be the default mode of providing social security.</p> <p>If we take as our starting point the supposed need to reduce social expenditure, we will not arrive at the goal of reducing poverty and inequality. If our efforts as a society are predicated on the alleged need to \u201cget people off welfare\u201d we will certainly go some way to cutting the welfare budget and getting people off the government ledger. But we will find that, even though, as in New Zealand, there will hopefully be some good news stories, there will also be entire cohorts of people who are thrown into the arms of loan sharks and predatory payday lenders and condemned to count on charity when all they long for is justice.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/grogonomics/2016/aug/22/why-unemployment-is-no-longer-the-best-indicator-of-the-economys-health\">Why unemployment is no longer the best indicator of the economy's health | Greg Jericho</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It is time we actually invested in people and communities.

  "<h2>Up on the roof in Stockholm<br></h2> <p>\u201cAre you scared of heights?\u201d my guide Veerle, a Belgian transplant who has been running tours in Stockholm since 2007, asks as she double-checks my safety harness. I meet her eyes with a smile and before I answer, she responds: \u201cI can tell you\u2019re not\u201d.</p> <p>Helmets fastened, we climb out of an attic-like hatch onto narrow mesh metal rails. We clip on our carabiners which are roped to a 250-metre metal wire track running along the base of those rails. We drag our ropes alongside us as we begin our 43-metre high walk across the 19th century rooftops of the Old Parliament House (Gamla riksdagshuset) on Riddarholmen island in Stockholm.</p> <p>The Old Parliament opened in 1833 and served as the seat of Sweden\u2019s government until 1905. Its iconic national romantic style waterfront facade of burnt orange and pale green towers was added in 1911. Today, it serves as a courthouse.</p> <p>Stockholm is spread across 14 islands interlinked by 57 bridges, waterways, and pedestrian paths, and seeing it from the vantage of a rooftop gives a real sense of its maritime geography. From my starting spot high above Riddarholmen, I watch Baltic cruise ships sail into the harbour next to Gamla stan (Stockholm\u2019s medieval old town) to my left, and docked boat hotels bob gently along Lake M\u00e4laren to my right. Mustard yellow and pale ochre buildings with charcoal-coloured roofs dot the islands like toy houses.</p> <p>We start with what I consider the easiest stretch of the walk \u2013 short climbs up and down two metal ladders with south side views towards Stockholm\u2019s hipster island, S\u00f6dermalm.</p> <p>Seven storeys up, exposed to the elements with chilly gusts of wind whipping around us, I begin to question my comfort with heights. At which point I have to tackle the most hair-raising walkway, testing my nonexistent tightrope walking skills. Veerle offers up some navigational advice. \u201cTry going sideways, it\u2019s easier that way.\u201d I shuffle along the narrowest edge of the parliament building, side-stepping like a crab, not daring to look down.</p> <p>Once across, I check my nerves and am instantly rewarded with views of Kungsholmen island and Stadshuset (city hall), another iconic building marked by a 106-metre tower where the Nobel Prize banquet takes place each year.</p> <p>A few short steps up and I am now on the final stretch of the circuit, back towards our opening hatch, balancing with no hand support, walking down rails across the roof which now slopes sharply down on both sides, and picture-perfect views of Gamla stan ahead.</p> <p>Exhilaration courses through me and I turn to Veerle with a cheesy grin across my face.</p> <p>\u201cI know,\u201d she smiles back before I utter a word. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to get off the roof.\u201d<br>\u2022 <em>The tour runs twice daily in July and August (rest of the year weekends only), 10am and 4pm.

  "<p>First, the myths. There are no \u201csuper rats\u201d. Apart from a specific subtropical breed, they do not get much bigger <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/mar/11/fake-giant-rat-picture-internet\">than 20 inches long, including the tail</a>. They are not blind, nor are they afraid of cats. They do not carry rabies. They do not, as was reported in 1969 regarding an island in Indonesia, fall from the sky. Their communities are not led by elusive, giant \u201cking rats\u201d. Rat skeletons cannot liquefy and reconstitute at will. (For some otherwise rational people, this is a genuine concern.) They are not indestructible, and there are not as many of them as we think. The one-rat-per-human in New York City estimate is pure fiction. Consider this the good news.</p> <p>In most other respects, \u201cthe rat problem\u201d, as it has come to be known, is a perfect nightmare. Wherever humans go, rats follow, forming shadow cities under our metropolises and hollows beneath our farmlands. They thrive in our squalor, making homes of our sewers, abandoned alleys, and neglected parks. They poison food, bite babies, undermine buildings, spread disease, decimate crop yields, and <em>very</em> occasionally eat people alive.<strong> </strong>A male and female left to their own devices for one year \u2013 the average lifespan of a city rat \u2013 can beget 15,000 descendants.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed element--supporting\" data-alt=\"A new way of controlling rat numbers.\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.facebook.com/plugins/video.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Ftheguardian%2Fvideos%2F565004370353997%2F&amp;show_text=0&amp;width=400&amp;height=400\" style=\"max-width:400px;max-height:400px\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"400\" width=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>There may be no \u201cking rat\u201d, but there are \u201crat kings\u201d, groups of up to 30 rats whose tails have knotted together to form one giant, swirling mass. Rats may be unable to liquefy their bones to slide under doors, but they don\u2019t need to: their skeletons are so flexible that they can squeeze their way through any hole or crack wider than half an inch. They are cannibals, and they sometimes laugh <a href=\"http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/rats-laugh-but-not-like-human/\">(sort of)</a> \u2013 especially when tickled. They can appear en masse, as if from nowhere, moving as fast as seven feet per second. They do not carry rabies, but a 2014 study from Columbia University found that the average New York City subway rat carried 18 viruses previously unknown to science, along with dozens of familiar, dangerous pathogens, such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2007/oct/11/health.medicineandhealth1\">C difficile</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/hepatitis-c\">hepatitis C</a>. As recently as 1994 there was a major recurrence of bubonic plague in India, an unpleasant flashback to the 14th century, when that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/aug/17/black-death-rats-off-hook\">rat-borne illness</a> killed 25 million people in five years. Collectively, rats are responsible for more human death than any other mammal on earth.</p> <p>Humans have a peculiar talent for exterminating other species. In the case of rats, we have been pursuing their total demise for centuries. We have invented elaborate, gruesome traps. We have trained dogs, ferrets, and cats to kill them. We have invented ultrasonic machines to drive them away with high-pitched noise. (Those machines, still popular, do not work.) We have poisoned them in their millions. In 1930, faced with a rat infestation on Rikers Island, New York City officials flushed the area with mustard gas. In the late 1940s, scientists developed anticoagulants to treat thrombosis in humans, and some years later supertoxic versions of the drugs were developed in order to kill rats by making them bleed to death from the inside after a single dose. Cityscapes and farmlands were drenched with thousands of tons of these chemicals. During the 1970s, we used DDT. These days, rat poison is not just sown in the earth by the truckload, it is rained from helicopters that track the rats with radar \u2013 in 2011 80 metric tonnes of poison-laced bait were dumped on to Henderson Island, home to one of the last untouched coral reefs in the South Pacific. In 2010, Chicago officials went \u201cnatural\u201d: figuring a natural predator might track and kill rats, they released 60 coyotes wearing radio collars on to the city streets.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>How is it that we can send robots to Mars and yet remain unable to keep rats from threatening our food supplies?</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Still, here they are. According to Bobby Corrigan, the world\u2019s leading expert on rodent control, many of the world\u2019s great cities <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2006/dec/01/homes\">remain totally overcome</a>. \u201cIn New York \u2013 we\u2019re losing that war in a big way,\u201d he told me. Combat metaphors have become a central feature of rat conversation among pest control professionals. In Robert Sullivan\u2019s 2014 book Rats, he described humanity\u2019s relationship with the species as an \u201cunending and brutish war\u201d, a battle we seem always, always to lose.</p> <p>Why? How is it that we can send robots to Mars, build the internet, keep alive infants born so early that their skin isn\u2019t even fully made \u2013 and yet remain unable to keep rats from threatening our food supplies, biting our babies, and appearing in our toilet bowls?</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>\u201cFrankly, rodents are the most successful species,\u201d Loretta Mayer told me recently. \u201cAfter the next holocaust, rats and Twinkies will be the only things left.\u201d Mayer is a biologist, and she contends that the rat problem is actually a human problem, a result of our foolish choices and failures of imagination. In 2007, she co-founded <a href=\"http://senestech.com/\">SenesTech</a>, a biotech startup that offers the promise of an armistice in a conflict that has lasted thousands of years. The concept is simple: rat birth control</p> <p>The rat\u2019s primary survival skill, as a species, is its unnerving rate of reproduction. Female rats ovulate every four days, copulate dozens of times a day and remain fertile until they die. (Like humans, they have sex for pleasure as well as for procreation.) This is how you go from two to 15,000 in a single year. When poison or traps thin out a population, they mate faster until their numbers regenerate. Conversely, if you can keep them from mating, colonies collapse in weeks and do not rebound.</p> <p>Solving the rat problem by putting them on the pill sounds ridiculous. Until recently no pharmaceutical product existed that could make rats infertile, and even if it had, there was still the question of how it could be administered. But if such a thing were to work, the impact could be historic. Rats would die off without the need for poison, radar or coyotes.</p> <p>SenesTech, which is based in Flagstaff, Arizona, claims to have created a liquid that will do exactly that. In tests conducted in Indonesian rice fields, South Carolina pig farms, the suburbs of Boston and the New York City subway, the product, called ContraPest, caused a drop in rat populations of roughly 40% in 12 weeks. This autumn, for the first time, the company is making ContraPest available to commercial markets in the US and Europe. The team at SenesTech believes it could be the first meaningful advance in the fight against rats in a hundred years, and the first viable alternative to poison. Mayer was blunt about the implications: \u201cThis will <em>change the world</em>.\u201d</p> <p>Mayer is a tall, vigorous woman in her mid-60s with bright eyes, spiky grey hair and a toothy grin. Her ideologies of choice are Buddhism and the Girl Scouts. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of my core,\u201d she said of the latter, \u201cto do for others.\u201d In conversation, her manner is so upbeat that she seems to be holding forth radiantly before an audience or on the verge of bursting into song. When asked how she is doing, she frequently responds in a near-rapture: \u201cIf I was any better, I\u2019d be a twin!\u201d \u2013 she also appears to enjoy watching people wonder whether this is an expression they should know.</p> <p>When I took a seat in her office earlier this year, she clapped her hands triumphantly and said \u201cOoh! You\u2019re sitting in history and strength!\u201d There was a pause. \u201cI had a feng shui person come and do my office,\u201d she explained.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"b798d3f033b23f8db96dce47e9731cf2550c1f63\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b798d3f033b23f8db96dce47e9731cf2550c1f63/0_40_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Loretta Mayer, CEO of SensTech, holds up a test cup of the company\u2019s rat contraceptive formula.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Loretta Mayer, CEO of SensTech, holds up a test cup of the company\u2019s rat contraceptive formula.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Taylor Mahoney/SenesTech</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Mayer came to science later than usual, in her mid-40s, after a career in real estate development and a stint as the international vice president of Soroptimist, a global volunteer organisation dedicated to improving the lives of women. The career change was unexpected, even to her. After a close friend died suddenly of a heart attack, Mayer called up a biologist she knew and asked how something like this could have happened. The biologist had no satisfying answer; she explained that while heart disease in men had been thoroughly studied, little attention had been devoted to post-menopausal heart disease in women. \u201cWell you\u2019ve got to change it,\u201d Mayer replied, outraged. The biologist was otherwise occupied, so Mayer decided to do it herself. At 46, she entered a PhD programme in biology at Northern Arizona University.</p> <p>After graduate school, her initial research as a professor of biology at Northern Arizona focused on artificially inducing menopause in lab mice so that she could study changes in the postmenopausal heart. Three years into her efforts, Mayer was contacted by Patricia Hoyer, a colleague in Phoenix, who said that she had stumbled across a chemical that seemed to make mice infertile, without having any other effects. Together, Mayer and Hoyer synthesised a new compound, which they called Mouseopause.</p> <p>Shortly after Mayer and Hoyer published their work on Mouseopause in 2005, Mayer received a telephone call from a veterinarian in Gallup, New Mexico, who had read about her research. The Navajo reservation where he worked was overrun by wild dogs. There were too many to spay and neuter, so he was euthanising almost 500 a month. \u201cIf you could do for a dog what you can do for a mouse, I could stop killing dogs out here,\u201d he told her.</p> <p>Mayer describes herself as \u201cextremely connected to animals, dogs in particular\u201d. When she arrived in Gallup and saw the piled corpses, she agreed to test Mouseopause on an initial group of 18 reservation dogs. \u201cI held up that first puppy, who I called Patient Zero,\u201d she told me, \u201cand I said, \u2018I don\u2019t know what this is gonna do to you, but you will live on a satin pillow the rest of your days.\u201d The injection made the dogs infertile, but left them otherwise happy and healthy. (Mayer brought home all 18 dogs and built a kennel in her yard to house them until she could find homes for them with families she knew personally. Patient Zero, renamed Cheetah, lived with her until she died of old age \u2013 though the pillow was fleece.)</p> <p>The next call came from Australia in 2006. Biologists there wanted an adaptation of Mouseopause for rats. Rats, they told her, were eating 30% of the rice crop in Australia and Indonesia. If she could reduce the rat population by even half, they claimed, the crops that would be saved could feed millions of people.</p> <p>Mayer was moved by the idea of finding a solution to rat overpopulation that was neither lethal nor toxic. Since its invention, rat poison has been our primary method of curbing rat populations, but it is dangerous. Ingested in high doses, it\u2019s fatal to humans, and it poses a particular to children because it is sweet and brightly coloured. In the US alone, more than 12,000 children per year, most of whom live below the poverty line, are accidentally poisoned by pesticide meant for rats.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2016/oct/14/man-v-rat-could-the-long-war-soon-be-over-podcast\">Man v rat: could the long war soon be over? \u2013 podcast</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The collateral damage inflicted by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/feb/09/trouble-in-paradise-lord-howe-island-divided-over-plan-to-exterminate-rats\">rat poison also extends to the environment</a>, leaching into the soil and poisoning house pets, farm animals, and wildlife that feed on rats. Worst of all, rat poison is not very effective at eliminating large infestations. As long as there is still a food source, colonies bounce back, and, especially in Europe, rats have grown resistant to the toxins. As Mayer often says, \u201cDoing the same thing over and over and expecting different results: isn\u2019t that the definition of insanity?\u201d</p> <p>Persuaded by the research, and by her wife, fellow biologist Cheryl Dyer, Mayer decided to devote her career to developing a new, smarter way to control the rat population. In 2007, they founded SenesTech. \u201cPeople say never to invest with a husband and wife team,\u201d Mayer joked to me. \u201cI say, \u2018Oh absolutely not! Then you have dominance.\u2019 But wife and wife? Works great!\u201d</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>For Dyer and Mayer, the immediate problem was obvious: while the lab mice and feral dogs had received injections in controlled studies, wild rats would have to eat the formula of their own volition. Rats are neophobic \u2013 they avoid what they don\u2019t know. What\u2019s more, city rats are already well fed. In <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jun/25/new-york-city-rats-evicted\">New York City</a>, for example, they have fresh bagels, pizza, melted ice cream and fried chicken in unending supply. To succeed, Dyer and Mayer had to make the compound not just edible but delicious.</p> <p>After a series of tests, they quickly settled on a liquid, rather than solid, formulation. Rats have to drink 10% of their body weight every day to survive, and so are always looking out for something potable. \u201cWe compared the [two] and they peed on the solid and drank the liquid,\u201d Dyer told me. \u201cRats are pretty straightforward.\u201d</p> <p>Where Mayer is tall and voluble, Dyer is short and broad-shouldered, quiet and succinct. She seems most comfortable behind the scenes, if only because it is easier to get away with wearing Hawaiian-print shirts and no shoes. At SenesTech\u2019s headquarters, Dyer\u2019s windowless office is right next to Mayer\u2019s, and if Mayer\u2019s office evokes Zen, Dyer\u2019s evokes an island paradise. Scenes from Hawaii cover her walls, hula (and rat) figurines line the shelves, and on her desk sits a small wooden sign, which says, \u201cWELCOME TO THE TIKI BAR.\u201d There is also a widescreen TV, on which Dyer likes to watch old movies on mute all day.</p> <p>It was Dyer\u2019s job to make Mouseopause palatable for rats \u2013 a tricky proposition because its active ingredient, 4-vinylcyclohexene diepoxide (VCD), is bitter and caustic. Rats have the same taste preferences as humans \u2013 they love fat and sugar \u2013 though Dyer\u2019s experiments with various flavour profiles indicated that their appetite for both exceeds ours.</p> <p>She was also tasked with the greater challenge of adapting Mouseopause to work on rats, which are much hardier than mice. While VCD caused the eggs in mouse ovaries to degenerate rapidly, female rats were far less susceptible. Hoping for a compound effect, Dyer added a second active ingredient: triptolide, which stunted any growing eggs. The results were better, but still not good enough. \u201cThey just had smaller litters, goddammit,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Eventually, out of a mix of curiosity and desperation, she fed it to both males and females. The result was dramatic. It turns out that the triptolide destroyed sperm \u2013 the males became sterile almost immediately after ingesting the formula. This was a total surprise: no one had ever tested triptolide on male rats before. It was \u201cstunning\u201d, Dyer told me. \u201cTotally unpredictable.\u201d Test after test: no pups. She sighed. \u201cMan, you should have seen the No Pup party.\u201d After three years of research and development, they had a product that worked and did not harm other animals. (The active ingredients are metabolised by the rat\u2019s body in 10 minutes, which means that any predator that eats it is not affected, and the compound quickly breaks down into inactive ingredients when it hits soil or water.)</p> <p>ContraPest, the finished product, is viscous and sweet. Electric pink and opaque, it tastes like nine packets of saccharine blended into two tablespoons of kitchen oil. \u201cRats love it,\u201d Dyer said. \u201cLove it.\u201d Mayer, who taste-tested every version during the development process, could not say the same for herself.</p> <p>In 2013, New York\u2019s Metropolitan Transit Authority (MTA) reached out to Mayer after hearing about SenesTech\u2019s early trials to ask whether the company would test ContraPest in New York\u2019s subways as part of a citywide effort to find new, more successful alternatives to poison. Many cities devote manpower and money to keeping the rats under control, but New York, which is more or less the rat capital of the western world, is the epicentre of anti-rat efforts. Every incoming mayor of New York declares his intentions for a vast rodenticide \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2000/dec/01/michaelellison\">Giuliani even appointed a \u201crat czar\u201d</a> to oversee the carnage \u2013 only to leave the next guy even more to deal with.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"e032e663657a79a5b1a8811742b57d2844ee105f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e032e663657a79a5b1a8811742b57d2844ee105f/40_0_3241_4052/800.jpg\" alt=\"Brown rat (Rattus norvegicus) rearing up.

(Norway rats, the species infesting New York, are not in fact the largest rat type.) They asked Mayer whether they should send a few New York rats on a plane to Arizona so that SenesTech could experiment with them before coming to New York. \u201cNo, I don\u2019t think so,\u201d replied Mayer, amused. \u201cI never met a rat I couldn\u2019t sterilise.\u201d</p> <p>Mayer dispatched two of SenesTech\u2019s youngest scientists, women in their 20s, to New York in order to test whether the formula was appealing enough. Would New York rats prefer ContraPest to water or pizza? Wearing their best approximation of hazmat suits to protect themselves from the filth, the scientists patrolled the subway\u2019s trash storage rooms under Grand Central Station. They planted bait boxes filled with feed stations of ContraPest and then stood nearby, counting the rats that came in and out with clickers in order to track how many rats were taking the bait. For six months, they baited and counted, washing their suits at the end of each day in bleach.</p> <p>The two young women went home to Arizona with good news: not only did the New York rats drink ContraPest, the drink actually worked on them. The test confirmed the highest hopes of the company \u2013 there was an alternative to poison that would work, even in New York City, and they had found it.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>When humans and animals come together, there are choices. Mayer believes that if you understand the ecology of the animal and you understand your own ecology, then you and the animal will be able to coexist peacefully. After centuries of misperception and squeamishness, we finally have a good grasp of rat ecology. Now the problem may be our reluctance to look too carefully at ourselves.</p> <p>In his 1983 book More Cunning than Man, writer Robert Hendrickson lists \u201cthe obvious ways in which rats so well resemble humans: ferocity, omnivorousness, adaptability to all climes, migration from east to west in the life journey of their species, irresponsible fecundity in all seasons, with a seeming need to make genocidal war on their own kind.\u201d He describes rats and men alike as \u201cutterly destructive, both taking all other living things for their purposes.\u201d</p> <p>Humanity\u2019s long struggle with rats mostly signals the worst traits we share with them: our inability to live responsibly within our environment; our tendencies toward hedonism and greed; and our failures to look after the weakest among us. Getting rid of them means correcting ourselves first.</p> <p>SenesTech is not alone in its attempts to devise a more sustainable, responsible method of ending the rat problem. Its work is heir to an existing method: integrated pest management, or IPM, which holds that if humans \u2013 particularly city-dwellers \u2013 took more care with their environment, rats wouldn\u2019t thrive.</p> <p>IPM\u2019s most vocal advocate is Bobby Corrigan, who has brought its principles to farmlands and cities all over the world, most notably New York, which recently revised its rat control programme on his advice. Twice a year, he teaches the New York health department\u2019s \u201cRat Academy\u201d, a three-day training for industry professionals. This April, there were maybe 100 attendees wedged into wooden theatre seats in a downtown auditorium, holding weak coffee and spongy muffins.</p> <p>Corrigan is a thinnish, pale man, bald except for a low, wispy crown framing his ears. He spends his nights on the streets or in basement corners studying rats. Once, he lay in an alley with peanut butter spread around him all night so he could get good photographs. (\u201cNo, it wasn\u2019t safe. Yes, they were urinating on me. In grad school, you do crazy things.\u201d) He regards his work with utmost seriousness.</p> <p>\u201cHere\u2019s what health professionals do,\u201d he said to his audience by way of introduction. He pointed at a slide behind him and read aloud.</p> <blockquote> <p><em>We protect the roof over people\u2019s heads.</em><br><em> We protect the food they eat.</em><br><em> We protect their health, comfort and safety.</em></p> </blockquote> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not saying this to pat us on the back. This is real. This is our job. [Rats] get on airplanes. They gnaw on wires. They cause diseases. To me, this is the shot heard round the world.\u201d Then he spent 20 minutes explaining how to divine information from rat droppings based on their moisture.</p> <p>As the day wore on, Corrigan\u2019s core message for his audience emerged: fighting rats means committing to holistic efforts, not looking for a quick, flashy fix. \u201cWe love to spritz problems away,\u201d Corrigan told me later. \u201cA chemical or a trap, it\u2019s a Band Aid, and they\u2019re Band Aids that come off very quickly.\u201d Instead, Corrigan argues that you first need to remove the rat\u2019s food, then remove the rat\u2019s shelter, and only then take lethal measures if you have to.</p> <p>In theory, this solution is simple. It does not involve radar or guns. Instead, it demands lids for the trash can, and caulking for the cracks in foundations, or \u201ckeeping our own little nests clean\u201d, as Corrigan says. It is the obvious answer, the one that has been sitting under our noses for centuries: stop feeding them, stop housing them, and they will go away on their own.</p> <p>The problem is that people, as a rule, prefer the quick fix. Setting out poison is easier; the ultrasonic machine looks cool. The sensible, labour-intensive option meets with resistance. Often, when Corrigan is called out to consult with a property owner, the owner rejects his advice, simply because following it would require too much thought, effort or expense.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Your rats are my rats. If the city blows it off, the sewer rats become everybody\u2019s rats.

Ricky Simeone, the director of pest control for New York\u2019s health department, explained to me that the neighbourhoods that struggle with the worst rat infestations are not the ones who file the most reports to his office. The poorest neighbourhoods are too overwhelmed with other social or economic problems to file complaints \u2013 or, worse, they accept rat infestation as one of the conditions of living in poverty.</p> <p>Corrigan confirmed that rats, especially in cities, affect the poor more than the rich, because effective pest control services are expensive. But he pointed out that no one totally escapes the rat problem, no matter how rich. Cities such as New York make evident a universal truth. \u201cWe\u2019re all holding hands whether we know it or like it. Your rats are my rats. If the city blows it off, the sewer rats become everybody\u2019s rats. Rats are everybody\u2019s issue.</p> <p>\u201cEveryone thinks, \u2018It\u2019s not my job, it\u2019s someone else\u2019s job,\u2019\u201d Corrigan continued. \u201cThey think, \u2018Oh I live in New York, no one can get rid of the rats in New York!\u2019\u201d He gave a short sigh. \u201cWe don\u2019t think we can do it alone, so we don\u2019t do anything as a group.\u201d As with all conditions that threaten everyone but torment the disadvantaged above all, the situation is not better because we are not better.</p> <p>\u201cHomo sapiens,\u201d Corrigan said to his audience at the Rat Academy. \u201cDoes anyone know what this means?\u201d</p> <p>He smiled a grim little smile. \u201cWise man.\u201d</p> <p>Improving society is a collective project, but as Corrigan attests, it happens because individual people make it their business to incite change. Mayer and Dyer, too, see this as their mission. \u201cWe have to be better stewards than this,\u201d Dyer told me fiercely. \u201cWe\u2019re better than this.\u201d If SenesTech looks quirky in the attempt, its founders do not seem to mind.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"fc24d57fdceeb4b973e14de5cf688dd168e29513\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fc24d57fdceeb4b973e14de5cf688dd168e29513/0_197_2500_1500/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018Rats are so longstanding a threat to humanity that contemplating an end to the rat problem seems like a fantasy.\u2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Rats are so longstanding a threat to humanity that contemplating an end to the rat problem seems like a fantasy.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>* * *</h2> <p>On a Tuesday night in August, Mayer and Dyer held a celebration in their backyard for staff and investors. The company had just received US Environmental Protection Agency registration, a process that usually takes years and often costs more than companies of SenesTech\u2019s size can afford. (The EPA is making an active effort to get rat poison off the markets in the US, and received news of SenesTech\u2019s science with enthusiasm.) Now, with the EPA\u2019s blessing, the company could take ContraPest to commercial markets. Immediately, more than 100 calls and 200 emails came in with order requests. </p> <p>Mayer and Dyer live in a one-level wood cabin a few miles north of downtown Flagstaff, in a wooded area near a field of wildflowers. For the occasion, they had cleared the back patio, where Mayer does her morning meditation and yoga, and filled it with deck furniture and folding tables. The sun was coming down the San Francisco Peaks.</p> <p>It was not a typical investors dinner, but then, SenesTech\u2019s nearly 700 stakeholders are mostly firemen. While most biotech startups are funded by investment bankers and venture capitalists, Mayer chose to pursue funding from grant-giving bodies and a horde of private donors, all of whom made small investments, and each of whom Mayer knows by name. It was a pure accident of networking that so many of them turned out to be firemen, but she is thrilled with the situation. \u201cFirefighters really believe in doing good,\u201d Mayer explained to me. \u201cAnd they\u2019re like teenage girls. Once one of them invested, they all wanted in.\u201d</p> <p>There were perhaps 25 people \u2013 investors, board members and SenesTech staff \u2013 gathered on the back patio, eating tacos and drinking from Mayer and Dyer\u2019s impressive liquor collection, but they made noise for 50. They were boisterous and loving, hugging each other, teasing each other, shouting old stories to roars of laughter, and clinking glasses. About half the room seemed to be wearing Hawaiian patterned shirts.</p> <p>When the time came for Mayer to give a speech, she demurred for a moment before standing. Her toast turned briefly into an anecdote about flattening mouse skeletons in lasagna tins. \u201cBut seriously,\u201d she said, returning to her theme, \u201cWe knew [this day] would come. It\u2019s great to be riding this wave with you. It\u2019s just so sweet.\u201d Glasses heaved into the air.</p> <p>There was considerable work left to do: now that SenesTech had its national registration, it would have to file for registration in every state. (Since then, the company has registered in 11 US states, and begun registration in the EU.) The manufacturing team was hurrying to make enough ContraPest to accommodate the requests coming in.<strong> </strong>Dyer was working hard on adaptations that would make the formula work in a variety of different environments, and planning variations for different species. Mayer was preparing for a torrent of meetings. While ContraPest has been effective in every test SenesTech has run so far, there is a lot still to learn about how rats in different parts of the world will respond to it in the wild.</p> <p>It sounds crazy: a band of animal lovers<strong> </strong>and firemen in the mountains of Arizona, led by a Buddhist girl scout, making a pink milkshake for rats that may eventually improve the lives of millions of people. They are unruffled by scepticism: In the middle of one interview, Mayer forgot a detail and yelled towards the door, \u201cCheryl, who said to you, \u2018That\u2019s just not how we do it?\u2019\u201d Dyer hollered back from the other room. \u201cWhich time?\u201d In response, they point to hard science, solicitations from governments and companies around the world, and an endorsement from Stephen Hawking, who featured them on his documentary mini-series Brave New World.</p> <p>Rats are so longstanding a threat to humanity that contemplating an end to the rat problem \u2013 and one that does not require us to kill them \u2013 seems like a fantasy. They are, as Mayer herself put it, a more successful species than us. Long after we\u2019re gone, they will still be here. But the possibility of a truce seems closer than ever before. \u201cThe answer in the future may lie completely within biotechnology,\u201d said Corrigan when I asked for his impressions. (He and Mayer consider themselves allies in the campaign to create sustainable solutions to the rat problem. Mayer fondly recalls a nighttime \u201crat safari\u201d she once took with Corrigan in New York.) \u201cThe SenesTech product is a breakthrough, but it is still at the very infancy stages of biotechnology for this species,\u201d Corrigan said. \u201cThis is going to be maybe years of refinements and changing and experiments. We\u2019re not walking yet. And we\u2019re certainly not running.\u201d</p> <p>Mayer, Dyer and their team seem cheerful at the prospect, and confident that they are doing the work of the future. \u201cDo you see this?\u201d asked Ali Applin, a senior member of SenesTech\u2019s staff. We were sitting in Mayer\u2019s office, and Applin pointed to a little sign on the coffee table that read \u201cMake it so.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThis is what she tells us,\u201d Applin said.</p> <p>Mayer nodded, smiling. \u201cThat\u2019s what you need to do. I mean, why squabble over something and say, \u2018I can\u2019t do that\u2019. Make it so. Find a way. There\u2019s always a way.\u201d</p> <p>After a moment, she had another thought. \u201cYou\u2019re really gonna have to do that, Ali, when you take this to Argentina soon. If we thought Laos was hard \u2013 I mean, my God.\u201d She grinned mischievously and folded her hands together and pressed them to her forehead and said a mantra. \u201cI wish you ease on the path to peace. I wish you an end to your suffering.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 Follow the Long Read on Twitter at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/@gdnlongread\">@gdnlongread</a>, or sign up to the long read weekly email <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2015/jul/20/sign-up-to-the-long-read-email\">here</a>.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 20 September 2016.

  "<p>Kate Moss and Kanye West have joined Instagram in the same week. A curious move in 2016, given that your mum joined last easter. So what does it mean? Judging by the first posts that communicate very little, the two have had a change of heart or direction \u2013 West stayed safe with an arty image (a shot from Total Recall), while Moss first posted a picture of her in a field in shorts (which she then deleted) before posting a picture from an interview with Business of Fashion. Moss\u2019s post might be new but a model on Instagram is not and this picture is (perhaps) illustrative of the power social media has in fashion.</p> <p>Since leaving Storm, her agency last year, the model has been stealthily setting up her own eponymous <a href=\"http://www.katemossagency.com/\">agency</a>. In a recent interview, she said of models including Gigi Hadid and Kendall Jenner: \u201cThey\u2019ve definitely got another side with it, like the Instagram side, and they know their business, I think.\u201d We know digital media is changing the way fashion and its people are presented but this has always seemed like a chicken/egg situation. Gigi Hadid\u2019s fame would be halved in the absence of social media \u2013 Moss is already famous and doesn\u2019t need to calibrate her brand. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BKiB9zjg5Fl/?taken-by=katemossagency\" data-alt=\"Kate Moss\u2019 first Instagram post\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;instagram-media&quot; data-instgrm-captioned data-instgrm-version=&quot;7&quot; style=&quot; background:#FFF; border:0; border-radius:3px; box-shadow:0 0 1px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.5),0 1px 10px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.15); margin: 1px; max-width:658px; padding:0; width:99.375%; width:-webkit-calc(100% - 2px); width:calc(100% - 2px);&quot;&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;padding:8px;&quot;&gt; &lt;div style=&quot; background:#F8F8F8; line-height:0; margin-top:40px; padding:62.4537037037% 0; text-align:center; width:100%;&quot;&gt; &lt;div style=&quot; background:url(data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAACwAAAAsCAMAAAApWqozAAAABGdBTUEAALGPC/xhBQAAAAFzUkdCAK7OHOkAAAAMUExURczMzPf399fX1+bm5mzY9AMAAADiSURBVDjLvZXbEsMgCES5/P8/t9FuRVCRmU73JWlzosgSIIZURCjo/ad+EQJJB4Hv8BFt+IDpQoCx1wjOSBFhh2XssxEIYn3ulI/6MNReE07UIWJEv8UEOWDS88LY97kqyTliJKKtuYBbruAyVh5wOHiXmpi5we58Ek028czwyuQdLKPG1Bkb4NnM+VeAnfHqn1k4+GPT6uGQcvu2h2OVuIf/gWUFyy8OWEpdyZSa3aVCqpVoVvzZZ2VTnn2wU8qzVjDDetO90GSy9mVLqtgYSy231MxrY6I2gGqjrTY0L8fxCxfCBbhWrsYYAAAAAElFTkSuQmCC); display:block; height:44px; margin:0 auto -44px; position:relative; top:-22px; width:44px;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p style=&quot; margin:8px 0 0 0; padding:0 4px;&quot;&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.instagram.com/p/BKiB9zjg5Fl/&quot; style=&quot; color:#000; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; line-height:17px; text-decoration:none; word-wrap:break-word;&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Business Of Fashion - Special Edition, October 2016 &amp;#39;Kate Moss Inc&amp;#39; Photography #nikolaivonbismarck Make up @kirstenpiggott Hair @jamesbrownhair #BOF #KateMoss #KateMossAgency&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style=&quot; color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px; margin-bottom:0; margin-top:8px; overflow:hidden; padding:8px 0 7px; text-align:center; text-overflow:ellipsis; white-space:nowrap;&quot;&gt;A photo posted by KMA (@katemossagency) on &lt;time style=&quot; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px;&quot; datetime=&quot;2016-09-19T09:01:32+00:00&quot;&gt;Sep 19, 2016 at 2:01am PDT&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;script async defer src=&quot;//platform.instagram.com/en_US/embeds.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> <figcaption>Kate Moss\u2019 first Instagram post</figcaption> </figure>  <p>Still, agencies are having to cope with a shift towards a system where models are hired for their social media presence, one where their personal brands are multi-faceted to the point of exhaustion: \u201cModelling is so much about \u2026 the constant demand for content. Models aren\u2019t just walking the runways and appearing in campaigns. They are also managing a constant feed of content through social media and online,\u201d says Imran Amed of Business of Fashion. </p> <p>Since Kate Moss is Kate Moss, suggests there\u2019s something to be learned from the move: black and white is the new lark, outdoors is the new indoors and trousers are still optional. West\u2019s post, however \u2013 an image of the Johnny Cab\u2019s cab from Total Recall \u2013 tells us nothing we don\u2019t know about the artificial fragility of our world. </p>",
  "<p>For a brief, wonderful moment it looked as if Labour might not manage to hold a conference at all this year, having failed to find a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/aug/25/labour-conference-in-peril-g4s-will-not-provide-security\">private security firm</a>.

At their phone banks calling Labour members, some Smithite MPs say they are getting better results than reported; others fear the worst. Two quite separate parties cohabit under one title, each accusing the other of betraying all Labour exists for.

All statements from EU leaders make it increasingly clear that there is no cake-and-eat-it option, no \u201cunique British model\u201d on offer; and the full force of the likely damage is dawning on one business sector after another. Brexit advocates crassly gloat: \u201cLook! The economy is doing fine!\u201d But nothing has happened yet.

Rebalancing our dependency on finance is not best done by wrecking it, with no substitute. Hammond was no Europhile, but any chancellor would be horrified at this loss of revenue. British manufacturers are similarly alarmed: the EEF, their umbrella group, warned this week that they \u201cmust have ongoing access to the single market \u2026 and be able to employ and deploy staff from and across the EU\u201d.</p> <p>That\u2019s whose side Labour must be on: Smith made that central to his campaign. If Corbyn and John McDonnell are supremely uninterested, the 172 must be the Labour campaign for all who will suffer from Brexit. It\u2019s for them to stand against the ideological saboteurs Theresa May recklessly put in charge of the negotiations.

  "<p>Terrorism has strained traditional American notions of individual responsibility. While such attacks fortunately remain rare in our country (data shows that out of <a href=\"https://ucr.fbi.gov/crime-in-the-u.s/2014/crime-in-the-u.s.-2014/tables/table-1\">14,000 murders</a> in the United States, a <a href=\"http://sanford.duke.edu/articles/law-enforcement-ranks-anti-government-extremism-most-prevalent-terrorist-threat\">few dozen per year</a> are motivated by religious or political ideologies of any persuasion), violence by a Muslim is often attributed to the entire American Muslim community. Sometimes, it is accompanied by calls for sending them home or <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2015/11/20/donald-trump-says-hed-absolutely-require-muslims-to-register/\">clamping down</a> on them in <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2016/03/22/politics/ted-cruz-muslim-neighborhoods/\">various ways</a>. Even before police identified Ahmad Khan Rahami as the person suspected of setting off the bomb that exploded in New York on Saturday night, social media was awash with anti-Muslim slurs and threats. A <a href=\"https://mic.com/articles/154532/dear-muslims-spreads-support-for-muslims-in-wake-of-nyc-bombing-but-bigots-hijacked-it#.NcyB4Nnqw\">Twitter campaign</a> launched to support Muslims was hijacked to spread fear and hatred instead.<br></p> <p>Already reeling from the divisive and bitter rhetoric that has marked the current presidential campaign, Muslim Americans are bracing for the backlash. My own Facebook page is flooded with warnings not to leave home and tips for staying safe if one does venture out, especially directed to those of us who look \u201cMuslim\u201d \u2013 like the two <a href=\"http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/bigot-ripping-muslim-women-hijabs-hateful-attack-article-1.2785475\">young Brooklyn mothers</a> in headscarves who were attacked earlier this month while out walking their infants in strollers. Their fears are hardly misplaced. According to a recent analysis by California State University, a <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3110202-SPECIAL-STATUS-REPORT-v5-9-16-16.html\">compilation of official hate crime data</a> from 20 states shows that in 2015 anti-Islam incidents increased by 78.2% and anti-Arab incidents jumped by 219%, \u201cthe most precipitous rise since 2001\u201d. Another study shows that <a href=\"https://www.cair.com/press-center/press-releases/13313-mosques-targeted.html\">mosques have been attacked</a> at rates not seen since the 2010 controversy over building an Islamic cultural center near Ground Zero.</p> <p>Increased monitoring and visits by law enforcement officers is another consequence often faced by Muslim communities in the wake of a terror attack. While investigative needs no doubt require police to question those who knew any person suspected of a violent crime, too often these nets are cast so wide that neighborhoods and communities \u2013 rather than individuals \u2013 become targets. This too creates fear among Muslim Americans and a sense that they are collectively regarded as suspects rather than citizens. While calls for profiling might create a splash in the news, study after study has shown that it is an ineffective tool for keeping us safe. </p> <p>We do not yet know much about the motives of the person or people responsible for the weekend\u2019s attacks. We do know that it is profoundly unfair to hold Muslim America collectively responsible for the violent acts of a few. It is also exactly what terrorist groups want: to sow fear and provoke governments and people to overreact. Our elected officials have been commendably restrained in their reaction to the most recent attacks. We would do well to pay attention to those like Governor Mark Dayton of Minnesota (which also saw a knife attack over the weekend) who called on Americans to \u201crise above this tragic incident and to remember our common humanity, our shared citizenship, and our shared desires to live together peacefully.\u201d That is the type of collective responsibility we should all embrace. </p>",

  "<p>The White House will <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3111057-Federal-Automated-Vehicles-Policy.html\">release guidelines</a> for self-driving automobiles on Tuesday, as well as model legislation recommended to states that want to follow in the footsteps of California, Florida and Nevada, which have legalized automated vehicles.<br></p> <p>The US Department of Transportation (DoT) will publish a new document containing \u201cvehicle performance guidance for manufacturers, developers, and other organizations\u201d, including a 15-point safety assessment automakers are being asked to sign and submit to the DoT.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>The national highway safety and traffic administration (NHTSA) will also solicit public opinion about whether or not it should approve new self-driving models before they are allowed on the market.</p> <p>In March, car manufacturers told Congress they believed their own internal standards were good enough to warrant approval. But in June, the question of safety in automated driving systems became far more urgent when a <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/jun/30/tesla-autopilot-death-self-driving-car-elon-musk\">Tesla owner, Joshua Brown, died</a> when his car\u2019s autopilot sensors failed to detect a large tractor trailer against a bright sky. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/mar/15/self-driving-cars-danger-senate-general-motors-google\">'Someone is going to die': experts warn lawmakers over self-driving cars</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The rules will define where self-driving cars can operate, how quickly they must react to failure, how they should perform after crashes and, though the rules mandate privacy protections, how system data should be recorded for \u201cinformation sharing, knowledge building and for crash reconstruction purposes\u201d. The guidelines outline validation and verification methods for automated driving systems.</p> <p>Perhaps most significantly, there will also be ethical laws set out for roadway dilemmas.</p> <p>Legislators warned automakers at the 15 March Senate hearing that the governing body took a dim view of the industry\u2019s ability to self-regulate. \u201cSomeone is going to die in this technology,\u201d Duke University roboticist Missy Cummings told the US Senate during a tense hearing where she testified alongside representatives from General Motors and Delphi Automotive, among others.</p> <p>Senators Ed Markey and Richard Blumenthal, who questioned car executives at the hearing, had cosponsored a 2015 bill to regulate self-driving automobiles. The bill was <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/senate-bill/1806/all-info#major-actions\">referred to committee</a> and never returned to the floor.</p> <p>The guidelines also address cybersecurity concerns: one major impetus for the Markey/Blumenthal bill was the demonstrated ability of hackers to break into and take control of car models currently on the market. The DoT will be releasing a set of best practices to the automotive industry for improving vehicle cybersecurity. These best practices, which complement important cybersecurity elements in the policy being released on Tuesday, will apply to all vehicles regardless of their level of automation.</p> <p>Six months ago, Markey was blunt with car manufacturers who complained about red tape: \u201cWe don\u2019t pass murder statutes for our mothers,\u201d he said. \u201cWe do it for all the people who might commit murders.\u201d</p>"
