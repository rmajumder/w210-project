  "<p>A system set up by bookmakers to address problem gambling is in disarray, according to campaigners, after a report exposed vast differences in how firms apply the measures.</p> <p>The report, produced by accountancy group PwC and seen by the Guardian, found flaws in how betting shops use \u201cplayer awareness systems\u201d, which are meant to curb addiction to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/fixed-odds-betting-terminals-fobts\">fixed-odds betting terminals</a> (FOBTs).</p> <p>It comes ahead of a government review into the machines, sometimes dubbed the crack cocaine of the industry, which allow players to stake up to \u00a3100 every 20 seconds. The PwC report, commissioned by the Responsible Gambling Trust charity, identified multiple flaws in player awareness systems, which automatically identify signs of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/apr/04/problem-gamblers-new-regulations-stop-wont-work-campaigners-warn\">problem gambling</a>, such as the frequency and size of a player\u2019s bets.</p> <p>Once a customer is flagged as \u201cat risk\u201d, they can be sent messages encouraging them to take a break or warning them of the danger of addiction. But statistics from the report, which did not name individual companies, found holes in how bookies are using the system.</p> <p>Of 169,424 active customers, who can be tracked if they have a loyalty card for a high street bookmaker, 8,219 or about 5% were flagged up as being in the at risk category during the first three months of the systems being used. But only 7,503 messages were sent to gamblers, meaning some firms identified customers as at risk of harm but failed to take any action.</p> <p>The statistics, from 6,723 high street betting shops, also suggest the systems are undermined by significant variance in the way firms are implementing them. One operator flagged up 1,398 instances of customers displaying at risk behaviour and warned them every time via pop-up messages on the FOBT\u2019s screen.</p> <p>Another bookmaker flagged 2,352 instances, of which 1,700 involved a customer whose behaviour saw them flagged more than once. But the unnamed company sent only 591 text messages and 36 emails over the period, suggesting it did nothing to engage with half of those players deemed at risk of addiction.</p> <p>The systems work by identifying certain markers that indicate a gambler is having trouble stopping. But there is no standardisation of how the companies interpret those markers or which markers they use, leading to major discrepancies in the data. For instance, two of the operators run a daily check for patterns indicating <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/gambling-machines-tax-hikes-fixed-odds-betting-terminals\">problem gambling</a>, while another of the firms does so only every fortnight. The length of time between a new customer displaying signs of potential harm and them being sent a message varied from a few days to 13 weeks.</p> <p>The report also found that only two people opted to ask firms to block from gambling during the period, calling into question efforts to promote so-called <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/apr/09/gambling-regulators-new-rules-problem-addicts\">\u201cself-exclusion\u201d</a>.</p> <p>\u201cAt this early stage of the initiative, the design of the systems and processes is still a work in progress,\u201d said PwC.</p> <p>It said that companies often did not track whether warning messages were delivered, nor did they collect information on whether the gambler changed their behaviour.</p> <p>PwC also said that procedures designed to halt adverts being sent to at risk players often did not work or were activated after a lengthy delay. It said that weaknesses in the player awareness systems had the \u201cpotential to detract significantly from the good work that has been done by the industry in this area\u201d.</p> <p>Labour MP Carolyn Harris (Swansea East), who chairs a cross-party group on FOBTs, said the report raised questions about the gambling industry\u2019s commitment to ensuring they don\u2019t encourage addiction.</p> <p>\u201cI wish they were as quick to send messages warning people to stop as they are to send adverts encouraging people to use FOBTs,\u201d she said. \u201cThey\u2019re paying lip service to the commitment to look after the punters, as they call them. It\u2019s not acceptable.</p> <p>\u201cClearly this system, designed by the bookmakers themselves, is in complete disarray and is far from adequate to address gambling addiction,\u201d said Derek Webb, a former professional poker player who founded the Campaign for Fairer Gambling.</p> <p>\u201cThis is only another ineffective PR exercise and it should not deter the government from stake reduction to \u00a32 in the pending review.\u201d</p> <p>A spokesperson for the industry regulator, the Gambling Commission, said: \u201cWe are pleased that the Responsible Gambling Trustcommissioned work to evaluate the effectiveness of player awareness systems across the industry, and making the findings publicly available demonstrates that it has been a transparent process.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe look forward to seeing how the industry utilises the results to shape best practice for operators in a bid to strengthen the protection of players.\u201d</p> <p></p> <p>Malcolm George, chief executive of the Association of British Bookmakers, said the industry\u2019s use of player awareness systems was a \u201cworld-first\u201d that demonstrated gambling firms\u2019 commitment to tackling addiction. \u201cThis report has greatly helped in identifying some of the strengths and weaknesses of the varied systems that were developed by operators,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cWhile each operator was at different stages of development during the three month period examined by PwC, which immediately followed the launch of the programme, identifying best practice has led to significant improvement since that time. We will continue to build on this work towards developing greater alignment between operator\u2019s player awareness systems and a consistent set of standards.\u201d<br></p>",

Frankfurt is often cited as an alternative destination, but the whole city of Frankfurt has 725,000 inhabitants. We are hearing a lot of talk about Paris preparing the red carpet, or Dublin, but it is not a zero-sum game.\u201d</p> <p>In a speech on Monday, Nick Clegg will echo calls from the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/08/after-sterlings-terrifying-plunge-bosses-plead-for-clarity-on-the-future-of-brexit\">City for a transitional deal to be put in place</a> after the end of the Article 50 process if the UK does not retain single market membership, warning food prices will see a steep hike if the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/13/david-davis-admits-possibility-of-uk-exiting-eu-without-trade-deal\">UK reverts to World Trade Organisation tariffs</a>, including on imported beef, cheese and wine. <br>  Clegg will warn that the under WTO rules, tariffs will also have to be applied to all imports into the UK until a trade deal with the EU is struck. In his third Brexit Challenge report, the former deputy prime minister will say UK farming will be particularly badly hit by tariffs, including 47% on milk, 40% on cheese, 59% on beef, and 40% on lamb. </p> <p>An attempt has been made by a powerful cross-party group of MPs to force a parliamentary vote on whether the government should reveal its plans for the UK\u2019s future outside the EU before negotiations begin, a campaign which was likened to showing your hand in poker by one cabinet minister. \u201cIf I were to sit down and play poker with you this morning, I\u2019m not going to show you my cards before we even start playing the game,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/16/brexit-debate-iwould-give-game-away-to-brussels-priti-patel\">the international development secretary, Priti Patel, told BBC1\u2019s Andrew Marr Show.</a></p> <p>A new poll, commissioned by the <a href=\"http://www.open-britain.co.uk/new_poll_reveals_huge_public_support_for_parliamentary_scrutiny_of_brexit_negotiating_position\">Open Britain campaign</a>, shows that nearly three-quarters of the public thinks the government <a href=\"http://www.open-britain.co.uk/new_poll_reveals_huge_public_support_for_parliamentary_scrutiny_of_brexit_negotiating_position\">should seek parliamentary approval for their Brexit plans</a> before Article 50 is triggered and the negotiations start. </p> <p>Leave voters amongst those polled also backed the move by 49% to 33% and Ukip voters were the most enthusiastic, backing the move by 62% to 20%. </p>",

  "<p>Saracens won the league and European double last season for a reason. A team often pilloried for being rugby\u2019s equivalent of the old Wimbledon FC on a dull day, they so ruthlessly exposed Toulon\u2019s fault line that at times they resembled Barcelona.</p> <p>Toulon like to direct their opponents into quicksand, bogging them down in a game where the ball struggles for breath. Saracens are no mean constrictors themselves but their rise from the arch-mediocrity of the Premiership to become the leading side in Europe has been based on an ability to expose the weakest point of teams. Here they kept the team they deposed as European champions on the move in an exhilarating first 40 minutes.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/oct/15/toulon-saracens-european-rugby-champions-cup-match-report\">Saracens make history by downing Toulon in clash of the heavyweights</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Toulon had no time to pause for thought and at times looked like a pub team that had just been thrown together rather than an expensive collection of players from around the world, all-sorts rather than all-stars.</p> <p>If the final scoreline suggested there was not much between the teams, Saracens conceded two tries when they had a player in the sin-bin, the second coming when they had two others needing medical attention and out of play.</p> <p>They were a few cuts above and will again be the team to stop in Europe this season. Their one failure was to pick up a bonus point having been in serene control. A loss of discipline after 50 minutes gave Toulon a way back but otherwise they exerted a strong grip at forward and behind, where Owen Farrell looked anything but a player making his first appearance for four months following a back injury, running as hard at the end as he had at the start, when Saracens launched a wave of attacks that left the home side gasping.</p> <p>\u201cI was a bit stiff at the end but I was ready for that,\u201d said the England international. \u201cIt was a good game to come back in for and I feel fine. I will have to see how I feel in the next few days, but it is not about me but the performance the lads put in.</p> <p>\u201cThe first half was one of our best attacking-wise. We played both sides of the ruck really well and were able to go both sides, where the spaces were, and we created chances. There is always a stuff you can get better at and we were hanging on a bit in the second-half. There are things we need to look at, but we showed we are a team that likes the big occasion.\u201d</p> <p>Saracens started the match on the front foot and finished it on the back one, equally comfortable in possession as in defence. \u201cWe talk about not being a team that picks and chooses when it turns up,\u201d said Farrell. \u201cPeople can say whatever they want about our style; we are not bothered. We will look at it when we stop doing well. We do what we do because we believe in it: that is all that matters. This was a big win and we intend to crack on from it.\u201d</p> <p>The Scarlets, who beat Sale on Saturday evening, are next up at Allianz Park this weekend.

There have been other cases this year which have not attracted as much attention and can be found on the BHA\u2019s website.</p> <p>\u201cThe substances involved at Ascot are very innocuous, being electrolytes and a gastric ulcer treatment, but it is right that we should follow up on these things when they are discovered.\u201d</p> <p>Two visiting French trainers, Jean-Claude Rouget and Francois Rohaut, were among those hauled before the stewards. Hugo Palmer and James Fanshawe were the others.

We would keep these things routinely in the horsebox but not in the racecourse stables. Horses can sometimes be given electrolytes on the way home if we feel they had a very hard race or, if they sustain a cut in a race, we might seek permission to administer antibiotics on the site.</p> <p>\u201cBoth were very old and out of date.

We\u2019re putting procedures in place at home to make sure it doesn\u2019t happen again.</p> <p>\u201cBut I do think there is a wider point and the question needs to be asked, why the BHA feel it\u2019s appropriate to go through a massive spot check of every trainer\u2019s bags on racing\u2019s biggest day, as if they were looking to make an example of people.</p> <p>\u201cI just wish they would take their finger off the self-destruct button, after the whip issue ahead of the first Champions Day.\u201d Palmer was referring to the lasting controversy that arose in 2011 when the BHA ramped up punishments for whip-related infractions days before the Ascot fixture, only to soften those punishments some weeks later.</p> <p>Mounsey noted that previous cases could be found on the BHA\u2019s online database by searching for Rule (C)33.

  "<p>Some years ago when Australia played France in a Test match in the regional NSW town of Parkes \u2013 known for a giant space dish, a movie about it called The Dish, and as home of the Parkes Spacemen rugby league club \u2013 it was the great and wise Ray Warren who said, \u201cThere\u2019s something about Test match rugby league\u201d. And he was bang on.<br></p> <p> For though that Test match is pretty much remembered only for a rooster that was set free on the field, there was, as Warren said, something indefinable about Australia playing Test match footy. Regardless of the opposition, to wear the famous wattle gold V-stripes on a background of eucalyptus green, makes you the best of your kind and from a storied line of champions.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/oct/15/valentine-holmes-stars-on-debut-as-kangaroos-down-kiwis\">Valentine Holmes stars on debut as Kangaroos down Kiwis</a> </p> </aside>  <p> And thus, as the Australia and New Zealand teams stood for anthems in the sunny pre-dusk of Perth on Saturday evening, cynicism about why Channel Nine and rugby league would want a Test match between the NRL grand final and the Four Nations tournament abated. And from a couch 3,948 kilometres from nib Stadium it was clear the Test meant plenty to players.</p> <p> For to play against our cousins from across the pond, you can\u2019t not be up for it. Facing that haka \u2013 brilliantly choreographed and executed, all the throaty masculine \u201cchallenge\u201d to it, the ripping open of chests, the crazy eyes, all that \u2013 you can\u2019t do anything but think, \u2018Well - these people really mean it\u2019.</p> <p> </p> <p> Other nods to culture: the \u201cWelcome to Country\u201d was was well received. The anthems \u2013 we got into \u2018em, got \u2018em over with. And a capacity crowd of 20,283 at nib Stadium \u2013 home of Perth Glory, Western Force and one day who knows West Coast Pirates \u2013 got ready to rumble. There are 1.85 million people in Perth and many, many Kiwis. If they couldn\u2019t find 20,000 to fill the joint for a Test match, Perth could forget rugby league forever.</p> <p> The early footy, as always between these foes was physical, willing, meaty, thick \u2013 all the good stuff. Jared Waerea-Hargreaves dropped the ball (a common Kiwi theme) and went at Johnathan Thurston\u2019s head with an old-fashioned coat-hanger. Yet Thurston was running low and the big prop\u2019s action was reaction. It looked bad \u2013 but Matt Cecchin\u2019s penalty sufficed. </p> <p> Cooper Cronk was a factor early, the fast little speed boat, nipping into the meat of the Kiwis D-line with his pointed incisions. The Kiwis coughed up the ball, and had no plan for when their allotted number of tackles ran out. Perhaps it was new coach David Kidwell\u2019s plan to let them play \u201coff the cuff\u201d. If so, it was a bad idea. What came from the cuff was poor.</p> <p> </p> <p>That\u2019s not an accusation you could have levelled at Greg Inglis. \u201cGI\u201d can look busted and even disinterested in club rugby league, such are the expectations put on the champions. But even after joining the camp on Thursday after the birth of his second child, the big man ran free, scored a double and fed Holmes with precision, purpose-built pill. Keep Inglis fit and Australia has super-strike on the left.</p> <p> Meanwhile the Kiwis continued to stuff things up. Isaac Luke \u2013 passionate, full-on, the leader of the tight-knit haka pack \u2013 gave away his customary penalty for attacking the knees of a player held up by another two. It\u2019s not a good piece of Luke\u2019s game and one day he\u2019ll snap a man\u2019s ligaments and feel really bad. </p> <p> And so it was all Australia in the first 20 minutes. And yet because of the strong sou-wester \u2013 the famous wind called \u201cthe Fremantle Doctor\u201d because it provides succour from the heat \u2013 Thurston\u2019s conversions were blown to hell. And Australia, with all the ball and territory, led just 8-nil.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2016/oct/15/australia-v-new-zealand-trans-tasman-rugby-league-test-live\">Australia too good for rusty Kiwis in Perth league Test \u2013 as it happened</a> </p> </aside>  <p> And the worm turned. All action Adam Blair, rock hard Manu Ma\u2019u and Martin Taupau came on as the Kiwis found their mojo.</p> <p> Jason Taumalolo ran hard, which is very hard indeed. Kevin Proctor ran a hard line on an angle and hit a hole off a short forward pass by Shaun Johnson. It was one of maybe three marginal passes missed by Cecchin and his touch judges, who did pick up another couple. But overall one referee was better than two. And it proved again that rugby league\u2019s quest for \u201cperfect\u201d adjudication does not make it a better game. </p> <p> And so onwards the Test match rolled, both teams repelling and attacking and throwing themselves about. The Kiwis got plenty from their \u201cHair Bears\u201d \u2013 Blair, Proctor and Tohu Harris. Australia\u2019s Boyd Cordner bled from the head like you he\u2019d been in a UFC fight while Holmes ran hard and straight \u2013 a super player who enjoyed a super debut.</p> <p> Cecchin punished poor ball control, and was roundly applauded. There was the odd \u201chint of a knock-on\u201d and Josh Dugan had hands on a ball that wasn\u2019t called six-again. But commentator Phil Gould said it best after watching a couple of replays when he said in summary: \u201cAnyway.\u201d </p> <p> </p> <p> Tyson Frizzel rumbled hard for Australia, making you wonder if he should\u2019ve been in a blue jumper a couple years ago, whether the great Paul Gallen could have retired an Origin champion in 2014 when he was 33. How good could Frizell be now? Just a thought. </p> <p> Into the second half and the Kiwis\u2019 fifth-tackle plays continued along the lines of ad-libbing clowns and bad street mimes. It\u2019s something that\u2019s pretty heavily practiced in as structured a game as rugby league can be, the fifth tackle play. To beat Australia \u2013 to beat anyone in an NRL all the Kiwis play in \u2013 you must \u201ccomplete\u201d your sets of six tackles. It\u2019s a fundamental building block. As is hanging onto the ball. And the Kiwis did neither of those things to reserve grade Metropolitan Cup-level standard \u2013 much less a Test match against Australia \u2013 and were summarily towelled-up by 20 points. </p> <p> And yet, looking forward, these things can be fixed. That\u2019s a take-away for New Zealand. As poorly as they played, it was \u201conly\u201d 20 points. Drop that much ball and stuff up so much end-of-set action you could expect to have 50 put on you. Yet New Zealand defended hard and with passion. It was a Test match, not a tea party. New Zealand can improve. </p> <p> But Australia can also and they will go into the Four Nations tournament in England as short-priced favourites. They will welcome back Aaron Woods and Josh Mansour, who\u2019ll likely take starting positions from Shannon Boyd and Blake Ferguson. At right centre Dugan did little good and was out-pointed by Solomone Kata. Dugan looks like a fullback out of position, and there may be a reason for that. Justin O\u2019Neill plays right centre for Queensland and North Queensland and had a storming Origin series. We\u2019ll see what Mal Meninga does there.</p> <p> But Australia are short-priced Four Nations favourites. Their champions \u2013 Thurston, Cronk and Cameron Smith in the decision-making positions, Inglis and Boyd out wide \u2013 on the back of enough ball just know how to get things done. They know how to win. </p>",

  "<p>Last week ministers began to take their first steps towards suspending the privacy rights of the nation\u2019s citizens. With little fanfare the <a href=\"http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/bills/cbill/2016-2017/0045/en/17045en.pdf\" title=\"\">digital economy bill</a> began hearings in parliament and while the proposed legislation contains some measures to be welcomed \u2013 such as creating a legal right to minimum internet download speeds \u2013 the big unwelcome change is that the public\u2019s personal data will be shared across departments without specified safeguards. What vague measures have been outlined the information commissioner described as <a href=\"http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201617/cmpublic/digitaleconomy/memo/DEB36.pdf\" title=\"\">incoherent and inconsistent</a>. If the bill becomes law, it will matter not if the data was collected for one reason and used for another. Government departments will be able to pool data collected without having put in place robust privacy protections. Such an approach invites public sector bodies to mimic the data free-for-all that currently exists in the private sector. We are already halfway there. Last week it emerged that details of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/oct/12/individual-childrens-details-passed-to-home-office-for-immigration-purposes\" title=\"\">individual children on the national pupil database in England and Wales were passed to the Home Office for immigration purposes</a> hours <a href=\"https://www.theyworkforyou.com/lords/?id=2016-10-12b.1890.4\" title=\"\">after ministers said this was not happening</a>.</p> <p>The thinking is that for all the hand-wringing over the prospect of a too-powerful state limiting civil liberties, more lives are blighted by the erosion of authority than by its extension. So the government points to success in mapping troubled families and says data sharing helps work out \u201cwarm home\u201d discounts for those in fuel poverty. Yet the bill is a symptom of a dangerously illiberal creed. There is an idea that data science will transform governance: that by harvesting and interrogating vast amounts of citizens\u2019 personal data, policymakers can pinpoint solutions to society\u2019s problems. It won\u2019t. Instead big data politics will furnish an overweening state with arguments to justify ideological choices. Data science is often just information alchemy. Look at what happened when the data suggested that a single mother in York had been claiming benefits fraudulently because she had been cohabiting with Joseph Rowntree, the Quaker philanthropist who died in 1925. <a href=\"http://www.thetimes.co.uk/edition/news/mother-hit-by-benefits-blunder-v57fz2m0k\" title=\"\">She lived in a property provided by the Joseph Rowntree Housing Trust, now a housing association.</a> With her welfare cut, she was forced to rely on a foodbank and told that she\u2019d need to appeal. As Cardinal Richelieu realised long ago, \u201cif you give me six lines written by the hand of the most honest of men, I will find something in them which will hang him\u201d.</p> <p>In an age of deserving and undeserving citizens, judgments will have to made over the division of resources. But should virtue be ascribed by politicians who can build policies by deciding how much privacy the public is entitled to? What if local councils could decide to revoke a residential parking permit because they can access your driving record? <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/6b31b8a0-2994-11e6-8ba3-cdd781d02d89\" title=\"\">Where\u2019s the debate over Home Office plans to build up a picture of personal behaviour</a> by running automated algorithms on bulk data sets \u2013 which could include passport records and police records? In this new battleground who is fighting for the interests of privacy in the democratic system? Since ministers have not spelt out data safeguards no one can give the public any&#xa0;answers.</p> <p>What we are heading towards is Facebook government. Ministers have decided to change the default settings on public privacy controls so that individuals\u2019 personal information would be shared, reflecting, they contest, a shift in society towards greater openness. They are beholden to the idea that by capturing citizens\u2019 data they can reshape the state for the common good. In this world, voters are not consumers of public services, they are inputs. But personal data is the property of the citizen. It is not for government to decide whether it can be repurposed without informed consent \u2013 a lesson apparently unheeded despite the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/jul/06/nhs-to-scrap-single-database-of-patients-medical-details\" title=\"\">debacle over abandoned plans to share medical records</a>. There is confusion over who can amass and manipulate data in the public and private sphere. Brexit complicates this, since we do not know whether the new <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/reform/index_en.htm\" title=\"\">EU data protection regime</a> will be in place when the digital economy bill supposedly becomes law. Ministers say transparency and trust on public data will need to go hand in hand. This rings hollow. Whitehall does not even collect or analyse its performance in protecting information. <a href=\"https://www.nao.org.uk/press-release/protecting-information-across-government/\" title=\"\">Last month the National Audit Office pointed out</a> 9,000 personal data breaches by departments. Ministers need to pause the bill and replace it with a better balance between the needs of government and the privacy of citizens.</p>",
  "<p>Control of our own borders was a principle demand of those who campaigned for Brexit, so it would be rank hypocrisy for us to seek to control who can enter another sovereign state (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/10/brexit-plan-divide-britain-ireland-uk-border\" title=\"\">This Brexit plan will divide Britain and Ireland once more</a>, 11 October). As a majority of voters in Northern Ireland voted to remain and are presumably happy for current border arrangements with the Republic to continue, surely the only acceptable solution for controlling entry into the UK is to treat Northern Ireland as a special case and introduce border controls at the entry points between it and the rest of the UK.<br><strong>Jonathan Wallace</strong><br><em>Newcastle upon Tyne</em></p> <p>\u2022 Increased UK/Irish collaboration makes perfect economic and geographical sense. Just as France has officers at St&#xa0;Pancras, in London, assisting UK counterparts, it makes sense to have UK officers in Dublin assisting their Irish counterparts, and Irish officers at London airports assisting their UK counterparts. There is also a prima facie case for a rail tunnel between Larne and Stranraer linking both parts of the United Kingdom. And such a project would also benefit the island of Ireland as a whole.<br><strong>John Barstow</strong><br><em>Pulborough, West Sussex</em></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/16/martin-mcguinness-calls-for-special-eu-status-for-northern-ireland\">Martin McGuinness calls for special EU status for Northern Ireland</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u2022 Claims that UK border controls on non-EU migrants to the UK at Irish ports will obviate the need for a \u201chard\u201d border between the Irish Republic and Northern Ireland do not bear scrutiny. After Brexit, goods flowing across the Irish border will be subject to tariffs and regulation, and without control points at the Irish border on the movement of these goods, a smuggling free-for-all will develop. Only a hard border can ensure that lorryloads of EU goods driven by EU citizens, rolling off the ferries in Dublin, don\u2019t head north unimpeded to cross the \u201cinvisible\u201d border. Of course there will have to be a hard border; the movement of goods from the EU to and from a post-Brexit UK requires it.<br><strong>Alan Wallace</strong><br><em>Leeds</em></p> <p>\u2022 My wife\u2019s relatives who live in New York State in the vicinity of Niagara Falls often cross the border into Canada to visit family or for other reasons.

  "<p>There has never been a better time to be a couch potato: an endless stream of shows, old and new, delivered online without pricey cable or satellite packages. Critics have called it <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/10/business/media/fenced-in-by-televisions-excess-of-excellence.html?_r=0\">TV\u2019s golden age</a>, but some analysts say \u201cpeak television\u201d is coming to an end.</p> <p>Money is the root of TV\u2019s problems. In the US, where the TV economy is headquartered, TV and internet access costs <a href=\"http://www.bbcamerica.com/anglophenia/2012/07/10-things-that-are-pricier-in-the-u-s\">two to three times</a> what it does in the UK, and networks are in a tug-of-war with Americans, who are increasingly shredding steep cable bills in favor of Netflix and streaming services. This summer, many networks became locked in <a href=\"http://variety.com/2016/biz/news/directv-att-herring-networks-1201727769/\">all-out</a> <a href=\"http://www.wsj.com/articles/fox-news-sues-charter-communications-over-carriage-rate-1468949656\">legal battles</a> with cash-strapped cable companies, with multibillion-dollar distribution deals at stake to fund those networks\u2019 huge programming budgets.</p> <p>Executives are planning for a less luxurious future, in which TV shows may be briefer, lower-budget and filled with the kind of product-placement ads that audiences hate and advertisers pay for. Worse still, the company that started much of the trouble may soon confront flaws in its own business model.</p> <p>Netflix reports earnings on Monday. Its problems, and those of companies like it, are more pressing than those of traditional television. At a conference in New York this month, chief executive Reed Hastings was blunt.</p> <p>\u201cDisney, who is very good in China, had their movie service shut down,\u201d he <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-netflix-china-idUSKCN1271PO\">told an audience</a> at the New Yorker Tech Fest. \u201cApple, who is very good in China, had their movie service closed down. It doesn\u2019t look good.\u201d</p> <p>Hastings said his company was seeking to expand in other countries, India in particular. But there\u2019s a reason media businesses seeking vast scale tend to view China as the solution to all their problems: internet penetration in India is rising from 26% <a href=\"http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/IT.NET.USER.P2\">according to the World Bank</a>. In China, it\u2019s rising from 50%.<br></p> <p>Netflix needs the money that increased scale would provide, in part, to pay top dollar for shows such as Arrested Development and Lost. In January, it told investors it owed $10.9bn in TV show licenses alone, with $4.7bn of that due this year. After that, almost the entire balance is due before the end of 2018. </p> <p>Netflix will have to keep buying reruns at what will almost certainly be increasing rates if it wants to retain its users, and the companies selling those shows are now in a tight spot too \u2013 largely thanks to the ad-free Netflix model.</p> <p>At US television networks, budget struggles mean making shows more as UK networks do, except with lots of ads and product placement: shorter lifespans, fewer sets and special effects, fewer episodes per series \u2013 and then little margin for error if shows look like they\u2019re failing early on.</p> <p>Netflix cannot scale back. Its viewers pay for it outright and express their displeasure by canceling subscriptions, not by changing the channel. If anything, its executives are spending more: Baz Luhrmann\u2019s 1970s New York period piece, The Get Down, came with a record price tag for a service that had already driven up the cost of new scripts: $120m for 12 episodes, according to <a href=\"http://variety.com/2016/tv/features/the-get-down-netflix-baz-luhrmann-production-troubles-1201822679/\">Variety</a>.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usv442G6H8A\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/usv442G6H8A?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>The Get Down, a series on Netflix that cost $120m</figcaption> </figure>   <p>All TV companies, not just Netflix, are trying to amortize losses by hawking American wares abroad, but that has proven difficult: US TV shows sell in a lot of places, but they don\u2019t sell everywhere. Like others, Netflix has tried to co-produce shows with local production companies, but outside the UK and Canada cultural hurdles become increasingly important. In 2014 after three years in Japan, network-owned streaming service Hulu <a href=\"http://tv.twcc.com/listings/wcbs-cbs#16-Oct-2016\">simply gave up</a>.</p> <p>Many are skeptical: analyst firm Macquarie Capital <a href=\"http://www.investopedia.com/news/netflix-downgraded-macquarie-capital-nflx-amzn/\">downgraded Netflix shares</a> to \u201csell\u201d in September.<br></p> <p>Though consumers believe it should only cost $8 a month to watch a network that airs a choice selection of history\u2019s great TV show, on top of eye-poppingly expensive originals, all may not be lost, said Brian Wieser, formerly a head forecaster for ad agency Magna Global and now head of research at Pivotal.</p> <p>\u201cThe suggestion that [TV] actually peaks implies that every network group acts with complete rationality,\u201d Wieser said. \u201cI think networks will heavily invest in content because it\u2019s an arms race.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/jan/24/netflix-us-television-investors-revenue-streaming-service\">Netflix and thrill: TV industry braced for rollercoaster ride</a> </p> </aside>  <p>An under-acknowledged truth in the television industry is that the only way to produce a new TV show on cable is to run an old TV show.</p> <p>Networks may brag about their latest critically acclaimed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/oct/11/bbc3-fleabag-louie-girls-transparent-master-of-none-sadcom\">sadcoms</a>, but the bulk of ads sold on a 24/7 TV network will not be delivered in the early evening when those shows run. They\u2019ll be shown on reruns of Law &amp; Order, The Big Bang Theory, Family Guy and a rotating selection of action movies that fill 21 of most network\u2019s hours, just as networks run cheap-to-produce talk shows and soap operas. Picking the right comfort-food show to snag channel-surfers is a matter of careful strategy.</p> <p>Netflix likes to tell the industry that its innovation is selling TV over the internet, but it might be closer to the truth to say that it was first to see $10bn in unglamorous syndicated reruns.</p> <p>And that\u2019s the hardest truth of the streaming economy: the bulk of Netflix\u2019s billions don\u2019t go into expensive originals like Luke Cage and Stranger Things. They go into buying old-fashioned shows such as Star Trek: Deep Space Nine and Buffy the Vampire Slayer in bulk. The creative system capable of producing those shows required 10 <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Df73k4LDcmA\">Bad Judges</a> and at least one <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLm5Sn1cMyQ\">Cop Rock</a> apiece.</p> <p>Easy access to such shows \u2013 first during the DVD boom, then on streaming \u2013 has bitten deeply into the support system that made them. </p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s no way you can look at linear [American] TV as a growth opportunity right now,\u201d said one senior executive at a prominent television company.</p> <p>TV ads are sold by guaranteed numbers of viewers, which makes for one of the industry\u2019s catch-22s: the fewer people who watch, the more the advertiser is asked to pay per person. At a certain point, the executive said, advertisers get fed up with the shrinking audience.</p> <p>The decline also poses a problem when a programmer has to outbid Netflix, Hulu and Amazon Prime for a hot script, because there\u2019s not as much money to go around. The growth of ad prices, the executive said, \u201chas not paced with the cost of original content\u201d.</p> <p>Still, the executive said, there are ways to get around people who won\u2019t pay for content \u2013 they\u2019re just ways consumers may not be thrilled about.</p> <p>\u201cThe model of the future is wherever your content premieres, you take your advertisers with it,\u201d the executive said. \u201cIt\u2019s taking television creatives and asking them to think commercially, too. The successful executives are going to be the ones who can do both.</p> <p>\u201cYou need producers and writers who can ask, \u2018What\u2019s a natural way for my audience to bring these products in?\u2019\u201d</p>",
  "<p>In a well-appointed shed-office behind a sleepy street here in rural Cambridgshire works one of the most influential and successful men in British Flat racing. Tony \u2018Bony\u2019 Hind has made his way from mucking out horses at Shergar\u2019s stable more than 30 years ago to become the dominant jockey\u2019s agent in the game, responsible for the champion in seven of the past 11 seasons.</p> <p>This year\u2019s success by Jim Crowley, a huge achievement by the jockey himself, is also the crowning moment in Hind\u2019s career. He received little public acknowledgment for his efforts in helping Ryan Moore and Richard Hughes to become champions three times each, the manifest excellence of both men making them unsurprising victors, but Crowley\u2019s case is different. As a 38-year-old who spent the early part of his career riding over fences, his credentials for stardom were less clear and he was on offer at 66-1 for the title when betting began 10 months ago.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/oct/15/minding-champion-filly-qeii-stakes-ascot-horse-racing\">Minding confirmed a champion filly with QEII Stakes success at Ascot</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Hind is not the type of agent to sign up everyone he can and play a numbers game; he is comfortable with 10 riders and would rather have fewer than more. But a gap in his stable opened up when Hughes retired last year and, from those jockeys who clamoured to fill it, he picked Crowley. \u201cI thought, there\u2019s something about this fella,\u201d Hind reflects, swivelling his chair away from the TV and the computer screen with the reluctance of a man whose working day, without interruptions, can sometimes last from 6am to 10pm. \u201cWhat I saw in him was guts. He\u2019s a horseman, not scared of horses.\u201d</p> <p>For Hind, Crowley\u2019s background in jumping was a positive. He notes that both Moore and Hughes were born to fathers who trained jumpers and both rode over hurdles in their early days. \u201cIt\u2019s very rare, very rare, you get a horseman and a jockey at the same time. You usually get a jockey but not a horseman. Some of them, you get a horseman but not a very good jockey. When you get both, that\u2019s when you\u2019ve hit the button.\u201d</p> <p>Persuaded, Hind told many friends to take the big odds about his new signing becoming champion, including a large number of his fellow Spurs fans. \u201cThey know more about horse racing from the last two and a half months than they\u2019ve learnt all their lives. They were going in the bars where there was football on, going \u2018Put At The Races on!\u2019 Some of them went racing, never seen a racecourse in their lives. I thought, \u2018Jesus, I can\u2019t believe this. I\u2019m enticing people into racing.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>At the root of Hind\u2019s success is his ability to judge form, guiding his jockeys onto the right horses from Ayr on Monday to Ascot on Saturday. He is helped by a piece of handicapping software he wrote himself and shows no one else. For fun he tried it out on the Coral Cup at the Cheltenham Festival, one of the spring\u2019s trickiest puzzles to solve. It has given him the last two winners and paid for his daughter\u2019s first car.</p> <p>At 57, his situation is extremely comfortable and he is happy to lock up his office for three months from mid-November and spend the off-season with his family, letting others worry about all-weather action in the frozen months. But there was nothing inevitable about this pleasing outcome.</p> <p>Hind was a lad with Barry Hills at Manton when he stumbled backwards into what has proved his calling. Darryll Holland, then an unknown teenager, emerged from the office one afternoon, complaining that he had tried to book rides for himself and could not do it. Someone called out: \u201cBony\u2019s got the gift of the gab. He\u2019ll get you rides!\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/oct/15/almanzor-beats-found-champion-stakes-ascot-horse-racing\">Almanzor beats Found again to win the Champion Stakes at Ascot</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Before he knew what was happening, Hind says, Holland was hustling him into a phone box with a tin of 10p pieces. \u201cI rang this first trainer up and I remember saying to him, \u2018I\u2019ve got Darryll Holland\u2019. He said, \u2018Who\u2019s he?\u2019 I said, \u2018He\u2019s the best apprentice in the country. He claims 7lb. He\u2019s brilliant.\u2019 Well, it just came out. I didn\u2019t know what I was saying. He said, \u2018Yeah. Put him on it.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Another trainer responded: \u201cGive me a ring when I\u2019ve heard of him.\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d Hind replied, \u201cyou\u2019ll call me.\u201d</p> <p>Hind used the names of Hills\u2019 assistants, Peter Chapple-Hyam and Joe Naughton, when he booked. \u201cI couldn\u2019t say I was Tony Hind, the stable lad, could I?\u201d The system fell down when Naughton wanted to know who was getting Holland so many outside rides. \u201cDarryll said: \u2018Bony\u2019s looking after me from a phone box. I\u2019m giving him a fiver a ride.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Hills\u2019s secretary took over but Hind was back in business some months later after relocating to Newmarket. Somehow word of his phone manner had leaked out and the jockey Allan Mackay talked him into having another go.</p> <p>Now that he is firmly on top of his profession, Hind hopes to stay there. He and Crowley plan to retain the title next year, though the agent\u2019s rule is never to look at the jockeys\u2019 table until the day after Glorious Goodwood in early August, at which point, if his rider is in contention, it is time to buckle down and give up all thought of sleep. His rallying cry to Crowley at that stage of this year was: \u201cPut your pyjamas in the wardrobe, we\u2019re going for it.\u201d</p> <p>The general thinking is that Moore is focused on quality and not sufficiently interested in riding lots of winners to make him a title contender again but Hind does not accept that. \u201cI can see him doing it next year,\u201d he says.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a bit different with him because he\u2019s the type of jockey who can get four or five winners a day. So he wouldn\u2019t need to [cover hundreds of miles and work long hours]. It\u2019s not something I bring up with him.</p> <p>\u201cIf, say, next year I look at that jockey table the day after Goodwood and he\u2019s 12 or whatever clear, I\u2019ll just say to him, \u2019Well, let\u2019s not sit in bed, eh? Let\u2019s have another one.\u2019 But no, he wouldn\u2019t be doing Wolverhampton on a Saturday night.\u201d</p>",

  "<p>When Delia Davin, the pioneer of Chinese women\u2019s studies, arrived in Beijing in 1963, aged 19, there were still camels carrying coal and wooden ploughs in the fields outside the city. Davin, who has died of cancer aged 72, quickly established a rapport with her students at the Beijing Broadcasting Institute, whom she found to be \u201cvery serious about their work, but [to] have a gaiety which saves them from being priggish\u201d. She taught them Irish songs as well as English grammar, and one of them recited \u201cShall I compare thee to a summer\u2019s day\u201d to console her, the student said, for not being in England on Shakespeare\u2019s birthday.</p> <p>This early experience of contact with ordinary young Chinese (many came from working-class backgrounds, one had been a soldier in the Korean war), at a time of relative freedom before the Cultural Revolution (1966-76), gave Davin an intuitive understanding of the Chinese that would enrich her long academic career and set her apart from many of her colleagues. Davin\u2019s Letters from Peking (1967), written during this first visit, already showed a mature sensitivity for the contradictions of revolutionary China.</p> <p>\u201cI can\u2019t help wishing the Chinese weren\u2019t quite so disciplined, didn\u2019t carry morality to the point of smugness,\u201d she wrote home, \u201cyet when I meet a Chinese who lacks these qualities I often find I don\u2019t like him.\u201d</p> <p>Davin had grown up in a literary Oxford family. Her father, Dan Davin, a writer and publisher, worked for the Clarendon Press and drank in the Lamb and Flag with the biographer and critic Enid Starkie, the poet Louis MacNeice and other literary friends. Davin would remember the novelist Joyce Cary as \u201cthe beloved grown-up of my childhood\u201d. Both her father and her mother, Winnie (nee Gonley), an editor for OUP, came from New Zealand, but there was a strong sense of the family\u2019s Irish background. Delia attended Irish-speaking summer schools in Donegal; in China she would compare the building of haystacks in Zhejiang province to those in the Irish countryside.</p> <p>Delia left school at 15 without any O-levels, but had completed her A-levels through evening classes before going to China in 1963 with her first husband, the sinologist Bill Jenner, and after two years in Beijing she returned home to gain a first-class degree in Chinese Studies at Leeds University. In 1975, she returned to Beijing, now a single mother with a five-year-old child, to spend a year translating Chinese into English at the Foreign Languages Press (FLP). It was the tail-end of the Cultural Revolution, as the struggle for the succession to Mao Zedong developed during his last year of life. In January 1976 she stood in the silent crowd which mourned the death of the premier Zhou Enlai, an unauthorised demonstration against the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2006/jan/07/china.jonathanwatts\" title=\"Gang of Four\">Gang of Four</a>, led by Madame Mao, who were seeking to seize power.</p> <p>She found Beijing \u201cquiet and rather dreary\u201d compared with 10 years before: upkeep on buildings had been neglected and everything looked shabby. But she deepened her friendship with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/1999/nov/24/guardianobituaries\" title=\"Gladys Yang obituary\">Gladys Yang</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/nov/23/yang-xianyi-obituary\" title=\"Yang Xianyi obituary\">Yang Xianyi</a>, the brilliant, married, translator team who had both been jailed in the Cultural Revolution, and had arranged her job at the FLP. Their household, she would write, was \u201can oasis of learning, entertaining talk and real engagement with politics in what was then an intellectually repressed society\u201d.</p> <p>Returning again to Britain, Davin published Woman-Work: Women and the Party in Revolutionary China (1976), a path-breaking study of women and the Communist party in revolutionary China, the first of many writings that went far beyond the stereotypes offered both by the communist regime and its critics. She would consistently probe the key tensions in the role of modern Chinese women \u2013 tensions between a new \u201csocialist\u201d emphasis on women\u2019s participation in economic and political life and a relatively unchallenged structure of gender and generational relationships in the family.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3f6777781cae61ac27612352edcf08a4bc1d5232\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3f6777781cae61ac27612352edcf08a4bc1d5232/2_0_1268_1584/801.jpg\" alt=\"Delia Davin bridged the divide between traditional sinology and social studies\" width=\"801\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Delia Davin bridged the divide between traditional sinology and social studies</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Family photo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>On the one-child policy, routinely criticised in the west as violating women\u2019s freedom to choose, Davin argued instead that reproduction in China had never been a matter of free choice for women, particularly in the countryside, where women were frequently coerced into having children as an obligation to their marital families. In an important later study, Internal Migration in Contemporary China (1999), she highlighted the ambiguous benefits of increased mobility for Chinese women. \u201cWorking extremely long hours in terrible conditions in China\u2019s new industries,\u201d she noted, should not be idealised \u201cas a liberating process.\u201d</p> <p>Throughout her career Davin bridged the divide between traditional sinology and the social sciences, and her work intersected with the international women\u2019s movement \u2013 she published extensively in collections that addressed women\u2019s issues across Asia and Africa,</p> <p>After lecturing at York University, where she helped found the <a href=\"https://www.york.ac.uk/inst/cws/\" title=\"Centre for Womens Studies\">Centre for Women\u2019s Studies</a>, she moved to the department of East Asian Studies at Leeds, serving as its head from 1997 to 2001. Colleagues remember her as an all-round academic whose teaching was immaculate in every area from Chinese documentary texts to current issues, and who took immense pains with students of all levels. Retiring in 2004, she became emeritus professor of Chinese and continued her research and writing. Her brief biography Mao (2013), in the OUP Very Short Introduction series, rejected current appraisals of Mao as no more than \u201ca Chinese Stalin with a taste for killing\u201d, while recognising that his flawed and contradictory character brought great harm to China after the communist revolution of 1949 and creation of the People\u2019s Republic of China.</p> <p>In Davin\u2019s last piece of writing, her introduction to Daughter of Good Fortune: A Twentieth-Century Chinese Peasant Memoir (2015), she returned to the theme that had always been central for her work \u2013 the complexity of change in rural Chinese society. The subject of the memoir, Chen Huiqin, had worked on the land most of her life, living in a house without running water. Now her home had air-conditioning and she could have video-chats with her grandchild living abroad. How long, Davin wondered, would the balance last between traditional and modern values?</p> <p>In 1996 Davin met Owen Wells, a probation officer, through Guardian Soulmates, and they married a year later. He survives her, as do her children, Lucy, Gareth and Sian, and her stepchildren, Jeremy, Hannah and Miriam.</p> <p>\u2022 Delia Davin, China scholar, born 9 June 1944; died 13 October 2016</p>",

He had gone to buy an emergency T-shirt at Nike after a coffee spillage. The shop assistant seemed surprised and disappointed, and had to go to a different till. Seconds were wasted, but my friend, who paid cash, appreciated his anonymity.</p> <p>A Mothercare e-receipt shows why stores don\u2019t like anonymity. It comes as an attachment, but the email includes an online survey request, a plug for a Dutch buggy brand and, right at the top, an invitation to download the Mothercare app.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"cc85d6021036e665c73a7c9d24d218c55911a4ba\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cc85d6021036e665c73a7c9d24d218c55911a4ba/0_0_4500_4497/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Retailers want more than a bricks and mortar \u2013 they want bricks and data, too.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Retailers want more than a bricks and mortar \u2013 they want bricks and data, too.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Daniel Allan/Getty Images/Cultura RF</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>E-receipts are the low-tech tracer round in a coming barrage. The response of the high street to the threat of online-only stores is to deploy the same ammunition. Shops, which have always been glorified warehouses, are blurring the lines between online and offline consumption in an attempt to get to know us so that they can sell us more wherever we are.</p> <p>Mothercare\u2019s app is part of this bricks-and-data approach. You can shop on it but it also encourages store visits, with a finder function and a way to pull up reviews of the really expensive car seat in front of you. Scan receipts straight from your phone to return an item. A lullaby player brings the brand into your life as well as your bank statement. It\u2019s not just an app, it\u2019s a \u201ccompanion\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cRetailers are trying to move to a long-term relationship with customers because loyalty as we once thought of it is pretty much dead,\u201d says Colin Strong, head of behavioural science at market research group Ipsos and author of <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Humanizing-Big-Data-Marketing-Consumer/dp/0749472111\" title=\"\">Humanizing Big Data</a>. The internet has helped consumers take power away from retailers. We compare prices and try stuff on in store before ordering it online for less.</p> <p>\u201cServitisation\u201d is one way brands win back loyalty. \u201cI call it the Nespresso effect,\u201d Strong explains. \u201cIt\u2019s buying into an ecosystem and not having to make decisions while the brand learns more about you.\u201d In a clothes shop, that means using your data to personalise shopping. \u201cThey want to bring the functionality and experience that people have online into the store,\u201d says Dan Hartveld, who helped build <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/ocado\" title=\"\">Ocado</a>\u2019s shopping systems. He is now head of tech at <a href=\"https://www.redant.com/\" title=\"\">Red Ant</a>, whose clients include Halfords and Topshop.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2016/apr/10/topshop-receipt-email-address\">Why would Topshop only give me a receipt by email?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Emails mean stores can gather your online and offline shopping history. \u201cThis single-customer view has been the holy grail for about five years but now we\u2019re going further,\u201d adds Hartveld. Red Ant provides Topshop with iPads so that assistants can pull up a customer profile right on the floor, and check you out. For now, the assistant still needs an email address, but Red Ant is working with a luxury retailer on a more sophisticated system (he can\u2019t say who); customers who have the store\u2019s app on a phone in their pocket will be sensed as soon as they walk in the door. Assistants will be able to greet them and present the shoes, say, that they were looking at online before they left the house.</p> <p>US retailers are a step ahead. Department store Nordstrom\u2019s \u201cinnovations lab\u201d can track the movements of consenting customers within the store. The marketing team finds trending products on Pinterest and updates in-store promotions. At clothing brand Rebecca Minkoff, shoppers can go all Minority Report on giant mirrored touchscreens, calling up items to be sent to a changing room, throwing in a drink order for good measure.</p> <p>Cute, but what does this all mean for my coffee-stained friend and his small-data instincts? \u201cThe problem is that shop assistants aren\u2019t yet explaining what the nature of the email request is,\u201d says Renate Samson, chief executive of data guardian <a href=\"https://www.bigbrotherwatch.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Big Brother Watch</a> and member of the government\u2019s privacy and consumer advisory group. \u201c\u2018Will you be retaining my address for marketing, or sharing it with third parties?\u2019 It must be clearer.\u201d</p> <p>Nike did not respond to questions about its e-receipt policy. Topshop said it introduced them last year and that there is no obligation. Customers must opt in to receive marketing emails, a statement goes on. New EU data laws due to come into force in 2018 will, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/eu-referendum\" title=\"\">Brexit</a> permitting, demand a more direct opt-in approach (no more \u201cuntick this box if you don\u2019t want to receive a million emails\u201d) and clearer information. But resistance is futile; the privacy-aware will need become ever more vigilant if they want to stay under cover.</p>",
  "<p>My friend Angela Sinclair-Loutit, who has died aged 95, was a colourful figure in leftwing circles in London. Into old age she could be found demonstrating against the closure of hospital services, at the Socialist Film Club, sorting out book sales for the <a href=\"http://www.morningstaronline.co.uk/\">Morning Star</a>, marching against Trident or demonstrating at armaments fairs.</p> <p>Bird-thin with spiky hair, she always had a twinkle in her eyes. She wore secondhand clothes from charity shops and was proud of it. She was often hunched over her computer until 3am, smoking and writing articles or letters of protest, occasionally sipping a glass of wine. Calling herself an \u201caggressive pacifist\u201d, she was a long-time member both of CND and of the Labour party, and was a friend of her local MP, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/jeremy-corbyn\">Jeremy Corbyn</a>.</p> <p>The stubborn woman I knew in her 80s and 90s had a more glamorous background than I could have imagined. Born in Kensington, London, to Edward de Renzy-Martin, a lieutenant colonel in the army, and his wife, Winifred (nee Hull), Angela was raised in Hampshire, and after attending Downe House boarding school near Newbury, Berkshire, was among one of the early intakes of women students at Oxford University.</p> <p>Already a determined pacifist, she became a conscientious objector when the second world war broke out and left university to sign up with the <a href=\"https://quakerstrongrooms.org/2014/05/22/library-resources-for-researching-world-war-i-friends-ambulance-unit/\">Friends Ambulance Unit</a>, with which she helped to reunite dispersed families, trained as a nurse under Edwina Mountbatten and volunteered to work with Slav refugees in camps in Egypt, where she taught herself Serbo-Croat. She then drove a truck, which she had learned to service herself, through Yugoslavia, delivering medical equipment.</p> <p>In Egypt she met Kenneth Sinclair-Loutit, a doctor. They married in 1946 and after the war moved to London, where Kenneth set up the Finsbury health centre. Thereafter, as Kenneth took on jobs of increasing importance with the World Health Organisation and as an adviser to Unicef, they lived in Canada, France, Thailand and Morocco, all of which contributed to consolidating Angela\u2019s great free spirit, full of empathy for the different peoples of the world. During this time of peregrinations, she did voluntary work as well as raising her children, and in Morocco ran nursing services and first aid from home.</p> <p>In 1972 she returned to London with their three teenaged children, but Kenneth decided not to return. Angela trained as a psychiatric social worker and settled in Islington, north London, where, in retirement, she wrote for the Islington Gazette and the socialist newspaper Tribune, was secretary of the <a href=\"http://www.islingtonpensionersforum.co.uk/\">Islington Pensioners Forum</a>, and campaigned against closure of the local <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2010/apr/29/whittington-hospital-closure-halted\">Whittington hospital A&amp;E department</a>. She was also part of a team of activists that helped to save <a href=\"http://www.islingtongazette.co.uk/news/environment/gillespie_park_campaigners_score_highbury_victory_1_808606\">Gillespie Park</a> in Highbury.</p> <p>In her 90s she became progressively more deaf and found it difficult to accept the infirmities of old age, although a procession of grandchildren, young relatives and friends paraded through her house to provide her with help and stimulation. Angela was bright and incisive to the end, up to date with world affairs and political developments. For each of us she had an ear, genuine interest in our lives, and a wry comment or two.</p> <p>She is survived by her children, David, Stephan and Jessica, and by seven grandchildren.</p>",
  "<p>By the time the final whistle blew, the morning\u2019s clouds and rain had cleared to leave the splendour of the Cleveland Hills clearly visible from the main stand. The only problem for Aitor Karanka was that the sun elected to shine on Watford rather than his increasingly struggling side, with Jos\u00e9 Holebas\u2019s glorious winning goal highlighting Middlesbrough\u2019s mounting problems.</p> <p>With \u00c1lvaro Negredo and Gast\u00f3n Ram\u00edrez once again letting themselves down, Karanka\u2019s horizon darkened appreciably as Boro rarely looked like curtailing a plummet down the table during which they have collected two points from six games and lost four of the past five. Their sole win came at Sunderland\u2019s expense.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/oct/15/aitor-karanka-response-middlesbrough-big-talents\">Aitor Karanka calls for response from Middlesbrough\u2019s Ram\u00edrez and Negredo</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Karanka blamed this latest setback on Watford\u2019s ability to waste time \u2013 a black art apparently cultivated by their manager, Walter Mazzarri \u2013 but the visitors would not have been able to slow things down with such cute gamesmanship had Boro proved capable of stringing more than two consecutive passes together.</p> <p>\u201cThey made it impossible to play our game, it was impossible for us,\u201d lamented Karanka before defending his hallmark 4-2-3-1 system which some observers feel is turning into a straitjacket for Boro\u2019s players, partly explaining why they have not won at home since April.</p> <p>\u201cWe have a style,\u201d the Spaniard countered. \u201cI\u2019ve built the squad to play that way, we won promotion with one up front. With that style we have a good chance. We have to keep going. It\u2019s just October so we have a long time to go.\u201d</p> <p>Mazzarri affected to be taken aback by the time-wasting accusations. \u201cI don\u2019t know what he refers to,\u201d he said. \u201cHonestly, I don\u2019t think so.\u201d The Italian then reminded everyone that Boro\u2019s Antonio Barrag\u00e1n should have been sent off for a second yellow-card offence in the first half. \u201cWe all know the rules and it was very evident. But I don\u2019t comment on referees.\u201d</p> <p>Without a ball being kicked, the team-sheets alone created a measure of controversy. While Mazzarri preferred Isaac Success\u2019s attacking potential to that of Odion Ighalo, Karanka recalled Negredo and Ram\u00edrez, leaving Jordan Rhodes and Viktor Fischer warming the bench.</p> <p>When Youn\u00e8s Kaboul \u2013 operating on the right of Watford\u2019s back three \u2013 swiftly turned slapdash and conceded possession the former pair had a chance to show Boro fans what they were really capable of but, after exchanging passes with Negredo, Ram\u00edrez dragged a scuffed shot wide.</p> <p>Watford initially looked vulnerable but Boro\u2019s problem was that Ram\u00edrez \u2013 deployed in the No10 position behind Negredo that is so key to Karanka\u2019s configuration \u2013 seemed to have developed an unfortunate penchant for persistently picking the wrong pass. Even when he took a corner, the Uruguayan Ram\u00edrez overhit it, leaving the ball sailing out of play. Negredo was similarly off key but, in mitigation, that pair were hardly helped by Marten de Roon\u2019s lack of control in a midfield anchoring role.</p> <p>Seeking a lucky break, Boro appealed for a handball penalty against Nordin Amrabat but, correctly, Roger East, the referee, refused to buy it and boos rang around a stadium studded with empty red seats.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/oct/16/pep-guardiola-manchester-city-barcelona-future-champions-league-barca\">Pep Guardiola builds on Bar\u00e7a past towards future at Manchester City | Sid Lowe</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The stay-aways quite possibly called it right. Although Watford improved as their formation gradually morphed from 3-4-3 to a defensive 5-4-1, the general standard was poor with far too many miscued passes and suspect first touches.</p> <p>If Karanka had reason to be content with Calum Chambers\u2019 and Ben Gibson\u2019s containment of Troy Deeney, Boro\u2019s manager must have been relieved that Barrag\u00e1n was not dismissed after committing that second bookable offence.</p> <p>Already handed a yellow card for hauling down Success, the right-back was fortunate to escape a second for pulling back the same player 10 minutes later.</p> <p>It seemed one of those afternoons when there would be more bookings than shots on target but Watford emphasised their efficiency by scoring with their first. Pouncing on a Boro clearance, Holebas took a steadying touch, before unleashing an elegant yet vicious 25-yard left-foot shot which defied the stretching V\u00edctor Vald\u00e9s en&#xa0;route to the top corner.</p> <p>After that it was all about Boro\u2019s lack of a Plan B and Watford\u2019s Italianesque determination to hold on to the win.</p> <p>Perhaps fortunately for Karanka, local anger was directed towards East. \u201cWe\u2019ve had some shit refs but you are the worst,\u201d they chorused after Holebas tripped Chambers on the edge of the area and no penalty was awarded. Replays showed the contact came fractionally outside the box.</p> <p>Indeed, the referee was the wrong target; arguably East\u2019s only key mistake was not handing Barrag\u00e1n a red card for that second bookable offence and, wisely, Karanka refrained from criticising him. Right now a manager who surely delayed too long in liberating Rhodes from the bench has bigger things to worry about.</p>",
  "<p>Everyone knew there was an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/16/secret-boris-johnson-column-favoured-uk-remaining-in-eu\">alternative Boris Johnson column, the one where he votes </a>remain. If we accept that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/feb/21/boris-johnson-joins-campaign-to-leave-eu\">his support for leave</a> was a decisive factor in the campaign, this leads us to the mournful consideration of an alternative reality where we don\u2019t shoot ourselves in the foot, and we haven\u2019t woken up in the care of people who have decided to chop the foot off, because surgery is just very complex and boring, and a Briton with only one foot is still mightier than a person from any other nation with two serviceable feet.</p> <p>Frankly, we were mourning already, and few of us had any illusions about Johnson himself, who tries on opinions like clothes, discarding them as the mood and weather takes him. He essayed this \u201cho, for the open seas!\u201d garb apparently for fun, and finds himself thrust on to the world stage dressed as a clown. So you could say he\u2019s already had his comeuppance; whether he\u2019ll ever have the self-awareness to realise it is merely a coda to this disaster.</p> <p>None of the arguments in his remain column are surprising. He pointed out that there would probably be an economic shock, which was obvious. He raised the prospects of a disgruntled Scotland, an emboldened Russia, a Europe in which your children and grandchildren aren\u2019t free to work, to sell things, to make friends, to find partners \u2013 all true, none of it original.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/16/brexit-debate-iwould-give-game-away-to-brussels-priti-patel\">Brexit debate in parliament would give game away to Brussels, says minister</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The only thing at all eye-opening about the column, for those of us who don\u2019t read him regularly, is how bad it is: strewn with references that range from irrelevant to plain wrong, unpersuasive, linguistically childish, structurally shambolic. It isn\u2019t the most dangerous thing about him, in his current incarnation as foreign secretary, but it is one of the most dispiriting, that we\u2019re forced to think deeply about the actions of a politician who wouldn\u2019t himself entertain such an activity for longer than five minutes.</p> <p>No serious government would have Johnson in its cabinet, but would that he were an aberration. Theresa May\u2019s appointments \u2013 most recently, the announcement of her <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/theresa-may-under-fire-for-picking-hard-brexiteers-to-help-control-eu-exit-negotiations-a7361291.html\">European Union exit and trade committee</a> \u2013 are all made to appease the most extreme elements of her party.

The actual party of government has been seized by its radical wing. We worry about the toxicity of their rhetoric and the chaos they create while leaving tactfully unsaid that this is because they are fanatics.</p> <p>Political extremism is often diagnosed in isolation, and used as a cover for some other objection. It is impossible to call an idea extreme without considering the seriousness of the problem it sets out to solve. A policy might look excessive if it were floated as a way to mend the north/south divide, but perfectly reasonable and desirable if its aim were to combat climate change. Ideas to tackle inequality look a lot more swivel-eyed if you don\u2019t accept the premise, believing equality to be broadly increasing on its own. So a hard Brexit \u2013 leaving the single market, leaving the customs union, halting the flow of labour, blaming <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/12/pound-drops-further-after-davis-hints-uk-could-leave-single-market\">the crashing pound</a> on the Bank of England, dealing with shortages in agriculture and service industries by <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/1985706/theresa-may-needs-to-remoaners-who-wont-accept-brexit-verdict-back-in-their-box/\">making prisoners pick fruit</a> (this is the Sun\u2019s big idea) \u2013 cannot on its own be termed extreme.</p> <p>First, we must evaluate what the leave side set out to solve: a dislike of <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/hard-brexit-no-latest-soft-eu-referendum-donald-tusk-theresa-may-britain-a7360406.html\">Donald Tusk</a> and Jean-Claude Juncker; a generalised anxiety that the government kept promising to control its borders but didn\u2019t seem able to; some confusion around <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3595170/Have-gone-bananas-Boris-splits-opinion-bizarre-claim-EU-rules-big-bunches-be.html\">laws concerning the shape of bananas</a>, created by Boris Johnson (the confusion, not the laws); a desire to control things that no nation alone can control (how much its currency is worth relative to others; who wants to invest in it; mass movements of people escaping conflict).</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>They have nothing but their confidence. Their ideas would not survive pluralism in the smallest amount</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Only now does the picture solidify: we are in the grip of the most fervent radicals, people willing to sacrifice everything \u2013 grants, investment, trade, security, standing, solidarity, legal apparatus built up by decades of painstaking cooperation \u2013 at the altar of a concept (sovereignty) that nobody really understands, and a principle (taking back control) that is abstract to the point of meaninglessness.</p> <p>Extremism in politics carries a heap of associations, only some of them borne out: it is taken to be a short-lived state, being incapable of compromise; unlikely to make mature or sober decisions; incapable of accommodating a broad sweep of views and possibilities. This we can see writ large in the prime minister\u2019s skirmishes with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/06/hammond-acts-to-reassure-city-and-wall-street-on-brexit\">Philip Hammond</a>, the only member of government visibly considering the national interest.</p> <p>To let in a voice like Hammond\u2019s would mean accepting certain realities: that the risks to our future prosperity are real and present; that an economic downturn cannot be dismissed as scaremongering when it is actually in train; that we do not hold every ace, or even any ace, in the coming negotiations, and some humility may be unavoidable; that business voices, even when they say things you don\u2019t like, are not necessarily doing so for base self-interest. These ideas cannot be permitted; the hard Brexiters have nothing but their confidence. It would not survive pluralism in the smallest amount.</p> <p>Other qualities attached to extremism are less evident: you\u2019d expect the hard Brexiters to be taking delight in their own victory, where instead there is only a querulous obsession with naysayers. You\u2019d think, given the burning fury of their convictions, that they would be overflowing with plans, yet the plan extends no further than to protect themselves from scrutiny and debate. You\u2019d hope for consistency and coherence; in its place, the bizarre spectacle of a party claiming to have been against the single market all along, because <a href=\"http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/economy/2016/04/michael-gove-gambles-he-rejects-single-market-membership\">Michael Gove once said so</a>.</p> <p>To be simultaneously so certain, and yet so chaotic, is perhaps an inevitable condition for extremists, but one you\u2019d only see when doomed to observe them at close range. The question is not whether they can last, but how much damage they can do before they fall.</p>",

The problem for Aitor Karanka is that they\u2019ve not been doing much of that lately. After starting the season with four points from their first two matches, drawing at home with Stoke City and winning at Sunderland, Middlesbrough have slipped since then, drawing two and losing three of their past five matches. Defeats to Everton and Spurs were understandable enough given the quality of their opponents, it must be said, and Crystal Palace were at the start of a terrific run when they won at the Riverside, while Middlesbrough\u2019s sturdiness was in evidence during away draws with West Brom and West Ham. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/article-embeds/docs-desert-fire-card/embed.html\" data-alt=\"Desert Fire\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/article-embeds/docs-desert-fire-card/embed.html\">Desert Fire</a> </figure>  <p>But the pressure is on. Yet to win at home this season, Middlesbrough need to start somewhere. And where better than against a side whose last away fixture ended in a dispiriting 2-0 defeat at Burnley, with Walter Mazzarri tearing into his players afterwards? Hold on just a moment, though. Other than that disappointment at Turf Moor, Watford have been quietly impressive this season, enjoying eye-catching wins over West Ham and Manchester United last month. They\u2019ve been playing some decent stuff under their new Italian manager. While goals have been hard to come by for Middlesbrough, Watford\u2019s front two of Odion Ighalo and Troy Deeney remain a nightmarish proposition for any defence when they are in the mood, while Roberto Pererya could be one of the buys of the season. You know what they say.

Legend has it Rice even inspired Uncle Sam\u2019s aesthetic .</p> <p>But the traveling circus in both Europe and the US always had its vagabond side with performers, circus hands and animals crammed into wagons, side-shows drawing pick-pockets and brawlers, life on the road attracting runaways and, no doubt, the odd fugitive.</p> <p>\u201cShaking that stigma isn\u2019t easy,\u201d said Milhollan.</p> <p>His clowning partner and wife Tiffany Riley, alias Slappy, said that clowning is a much misunderstood art form.</p> <p>\u201cBeing ridiculous is a serious business,\u201d she said. Slappy graduated from New York University\u2019s Tisch School of the Arts and she and Monday toured with the Big Apple Circus.</p> <p>They\u2019ve trained clowns and straight actors and now are often employed to perform in schools or cheer up children in hospitals, where the kids call her Dr Slappy. She\u2019s currently writing her master\u2019s thesis on the effects of humor on healing.</p> <p>\u201cIt upsets me, it really hurts,\u201d she said of the new wave of clown hysteria and hopes it will die down after Halloween. \u201cBut some people are drawn to the dark side of everything and if you put the make-up on a certain way, it\u2019s scary, I\u2019ll grant you that\u201d.</p> <p>Vocational clowns are not only up against amateurs and imposters \u2013 a new film version of Stephen King\u2019s horror novel It is underway, with an evil clown who preys on children as well as everyone\u2019s phobias and fears.</p> <p>And TV\u2019s American Horror Story series has <a href=\"http://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2015/11/walking-dead-twisty-the-clown-american-horror-story-john-carroll-lynch\">twice</a> recently <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2014/dec/02/american-horror-story-season-four-freak-show-review\">invoked</a> the real life serial killer John Wayne <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jan/12/john-wayne-gacy-victims-search\">Gacy</a>, a former clown who <a href=\"http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/politics/chi-chicagodays-gacy-story-story.html\">murdered</a> at least 33 males in Illinois in the 1970s.</p> <p>\u201cDistrust of clowns is deeply entrenched. The make-up that can be un-nerving and the archetype of the jester operating outside the normal rules of society \u2013 if you take that one step further you can draw that character as a killer and then you\u2019re off to the races, a figure that is adored and revered is co-opted and professional clowns have to reassure people and separate themselves from the crazy people running around. It\u2019s exasperating,\u201d said Pisoni.</p> <p>But he also acknowledges that \u201cthere is an inherent distrust of someone who is always smiling\u201d.</p> <p>But while scary pretend clowns hide behind their garb to threaten people, Pisoni said professional clowns flip that on its head \u2013 they are vulnerable, baring their souls as they attempt the tricky art of making an audience laugh.</p> <p>His new documentary, Circus Kid, which screened at the Woodstock Film Festival on Friday and is showing at DOC NYC in New York on Monday, is based on his biographical play Humor Abuse, charting the trials and tribulations of growing up in the circus. </p> <p>Pisoni began clowning principally to get the attention of his distracted father, clown Larry Pisoni, who created the Pickle Family Circus in California in 1974.</p> <p>He describes how, beneath the costume, the gags and the acrobatics, his father was a depressive who dealt poorly with his mental \u201cdemons\u201d and had a nervous breakdown in 1987.</p> <p>As that famous Smokey Robinson lyric goes: \u201cAin\u2019t too much sadder than the tears of a clown.\u201d</p> <p>Lorenzo Pisoni fled the circus once when he reached adulthood and became a dramatic stage and screen actor. Performing drama is a lot easier than comedy, he pointed out.</p> <p>And he\u2019ll be distancing himself a long way from Clown Lives Matter.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s making a lot out of something that\u2019s not funny,\u201d he said.</p>",

  "<p>Any day now, monarch butterflies will begin their epic migration from Canada to Mexico. It is one of the wonders of the world: insects whose distinctive orange and black wings barely stretch four inches flying on thermal currents up to 3,000 miles in search of a warm spot to spend the winter.<br></p> <p>The phenomenon has entranced Oscar L\u00f3pez Rivera since his childhood days in rural <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/puerto-rico\">Puerto Rico</a>. If he ever gets the chance, he says, one of his great ambitions is to trace the monarchs\u2019 route, all the way from the Canadian border, across the US great plains into northern Mexico. \u201cThe monarch is fascinating to me,\u201d he says. \u201cThe length of their journey and what they do to survive: how can an insect so small go so far?\u201d</p> <p>That\u2019s an achingly powerful question when you consider who is posing it. For the past 35 years, L\u00f3pez Rivera has been unable to fly, his wings clipped. He has been held in federal institutions, for 12 of those years totally alone inside a 6ft-by-9ft concrete box from which he had no view of the sky. The last time he saw a live butterfly, let alone a monarch, was in 1981.</p> <p>L\u00f3pez Rivera is one of the US\u2019s, and the world\u2019s, longest-serving political prisoners. Aged 73, he has spent more than half his life behind bars. He is convicted of killing no one, of hurting no one. His crime was \u201cseditious conspiracy\u201d \u2013 plotting against the US state in the furtherance of Puerto Rican independence. He still believes in what he calls that \u201cnoble cause\u201d: full sovereignty for his Caribbean birthplace that is classified as a US \u201cterritory\u201d.</p> <p>But his views on how to attain that goal have changed. Two decades ago he and his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/apr/21/cuba-us-thaw-fugitives-william-morales\">fellow Puerto Rican independence fighters</a> renounced violence and embraced peaceful political reform. The last year in which the militant group to which he belonged committed a violent act was 1983.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"758cc3c530694009b898016db0df5c89e43b96ca\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/758cc3c530694009b898016db0df5c89e43b96ca/262_0_3603_5391/668.jpg\" alt=\"The US government continues to see him through the prism of a bygone age ...

It is as though he is stuck in a time-warp, trapped for ever in the headstrong 1970s, a white-haired septuagenarian forced to dress up in floral shirt, flares and platform shoes dancing to Chic. The world, and L\u00f3pez Rivera with it, has moved on, but the US government continues to see him through the prism of a bygone age. </p> <p>Unless someone intervenes to release him, he will remain in captivity until 26 June 2023, five months after his 80th birthday. Fortunately for L\u00f3pez Rivera, there is such a person who holds the power of clemency: Barack Obama. As the US president prepares to quit the White House, he is drawing up his final pardon list, presenting the prisoner with a slender hope.</p> <p>Many prominent supporters are lobbying hard for the pardon. They make for an impressive list: Archbishop Desmond Tutu; the governor of Puerto Rico, <a href=\"http://www.elnuevodia.com/opinion/columnas/terrehauteindiana-columna-1868644/\">Alejandro Garc\u00eda Padilla</a>; the Hispanic caucus of the US Congress; former US president Jimmy Carter; Democratic presidential runner-up <a href=\"http://www.breitbart.com/national-security/2016/05/18/bernie-sanders-vows-pardon-faln-terrorist/\">Bernie Sanders</a>; and the creator of the smash Broadway musical Hamilton, Lin-Manuel Miranda, who <a href=\"http://www.elnuevodia.com/Interstitial/?oasSitePage=elnuevodia.com/interstitial&amp;oasReturnPage=http://www.elnuevodia.com/noticias/politica/nota/obamaatiendepedidodelinmanuelsobreoscarlopez-2175040/\">confronted Obama</a> about L\u00f3pez Rivera face to face during a recent White House visit. On 9 October thousands of supporters gathered outside the White House bearing placards of the prisoner and calling on Obama to set him free, their voices projected across the mansion\u2019s South Lawn in the hope that the president at work in the Oval Office might hear them and act accordingly.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>With friends like that, isn\u2019t L\u00f3pez Rivera a shoo-in for release? Not according to the man himself, who remains cautious about his chances. \u201cI do not practise wishful thinking,\u201d he begins in perfect English, delivered with a strong Puerto Rican accent. \u201cIt\u2019s very difficult for me to read President Obama. The way he has been treated, the obstacles he has faced in the White House, makes him a little skittish about decisions.\u201d</p> <p>What a carefully weighted remark about something as visceral as his freedom. In the course of a two-hour phone conversation (the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Penitentiary,_Terre_Haute\">federal prison in Terre Haute</a>, Indiana, having refused to allow the Guardian to visit him in person) it becomes clear that this is not artifice: the professorial tone is true to the man.</p> <p>L\u00f3pez Rivera says he draws some optimism from Obama\u2019s frequent expressions of <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-25250278\">admiration for Nelson Mandela</a>. \u201cHe embraced Mandela as a great man, he saw that what Mandela did was important throughout the world.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"79ddc06d448b2de372dd5ee68c69649d344063f7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/79ddc06d448b2de372dd5ee68c69649d344063f7/0_73_801_802/499.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018There is no regret inside my heart\u2019 ...

Photograph: larespuestamedia.com</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: larespuestamedia.com</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>To invite comparison with Mandela may seem far-fetched for a man who in the US is relatively little known, but back home L\u00f3pez Rivera is often cast as the \u201cMandela of Puerto Rico\u201d. Mandela served 27 years in South African prisons for leading an anti-colonialist liberation struggle that deployed selective violence as a political tool; L\u00f3pez Rivera has already served eight years longer, arguably for doing the same thing. Mandela <a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2013/12/mandela-and-the-question-of-violence/282255/\">refused to renounce violence</a> from his prison cell; but L\u00f3pez Rivera did so, some 20 years ago.</p> <p>L\u00f3pez Rivera was born in 1943 in San Sebasti\u00e1n in the north-west of Puerto Rico. His childhood was spent living in the constitutional limbo that has defined the island since it was ceded to the US by Spain in 1898. Neither a sovereign country, nor the 51st state of the union, Puerto Rico is caught betwixt and between. Its people are US citizens, hold US passports, and can be drafted into the US military as L\u00f3pez Rivera would soon discover. Yet when it comes to voting for the US president or a representative in the US Congress, a Puerto Rican is persona non grata. Quite rich, you might think, coming from a nation such as the US, which was founded upon the anti-colonial principle of no taxation without representation.</p> <p>\u201cThe only thing we are good for is to be cannon fodder,\u201d L\u00f3pez Rivera says in a rare display of chagrin. </p> <p>Not that he had a clue about any of that when he was growing up in San Sebasti\u00e1n and Chicago, where his family moved when he was 14. He was just an ordinary kid for whom the concepts of self-determination or shrugging off the Yankee yoke were as alien as nuclear physics. \u201cBefore I got drafted I was a happy-go-lucky Puerto Rican. I enjoyed life. I wasn\u2019t paying attention to anything other than me.\u201d</p> <p>Then along came Vietnam. \u201cI arrived thinking we were bringing freedom to Vietnamese people but as soon as I hit the ground I realised that wasn\u2019t happening. We did sweeping operations lasting 30 days, getting villagers out of their homes, moving them off the rice paddies, body-searching them.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2a6ee2197aacaa84df8412c45c149fb2e11ca3af\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2a6ee2197aacaa84df8412c45c149fb2e11ca3af/68_0_551_331/500.jpg\" alt=\"In solitary he would spend all but two hours a week in his cell with no sight of the sky ... a mural dedicated to L\u00f3pez Rivera in Puerto Rico\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">In solitary he would spend all but two hours a week in his cell with no sight of the sky \u2026 a mural dedicated to L\u00f3pez Rivera in Puerto Rico.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Public domain</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>By the time he returned to Chicago a year later, sporting a Bronze Star for meritorious achievement, he says he had undergone a transformation. \u201cI felt an obligation to change, to look at life from a totally different perspective. Now I could see what colonialism did to people.\u201d</p> <p>He threw himself into community work among the Puerto Ricans of Chicago. That brought him into contact with the families of imprisoned nationalists and, without ever suspecting that he would one day join their ranks, he was sucked into the movement and eventually became a member of the clandestine <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/topic/FALN\">Fuerzas Armadas de Liberaci\u00f3n Nacional</a>.</p> <p>As the name suggested, the FALN believed armed force was justified as a means to an end. Between its foundation in 1974 and its effective demise in 1983 as a result of mass arrests, the FALN was said by prosecutors to have carried out about 140 bombings on military bases, government offices and financial buildings across the US, especially in Chicago and New York. Targets were chosen for being symbols of \u201cYankee imperialism\u201d, such as oil companies with offshore rigs in Puerto Rican waters.</p> <p>L\u00f3pez Rivera insists that the focus was always on bricks and mortar, not people. \u201cFor me human life is sacred. We called it \u2018armed propaganda\u2019 \u2013 using targets to draw attention to our struggle.\u201d</p> <p>That may have been the case, but the results were, to put it politely, inconsistent. In 1975 the group claimed responsibility for a <a href=\"http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/manhattan/puerto-rican-terrorists-plant-bomb-tavern-1975-article-1.2484977\">bombing at the historic Fraunces Tavern</a> in Lower Manhattan, the scene of George Washington\u2019s farewell to troops after the American revolution. The attack killed four people and injured more than 50. Two years later an employee at the Mobil building in New York was killed by another FALN device.</p> <p>L\u00f3pez Rivera has denied involvement with these fatal attacks. But when I asked him if he ever committed acts of armed force such as planting a bomb, he replied: \u201cI cannot comment on that.\u201d Interestingly, he still claims justification for violence under international law, using the present tense: \u201cI believe we were adhering to international law that says that colonialism is a crime against humanity and that colonial people have a right to achieve self-determination by any means, including force. \u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2f4e4c3ef846b0e78866da991667e19dc4ac2be4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2f4e4c3ef846b0e78866da991667e19dc4ac2be4/7_0_3249_1949/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The scene after the FALN bomb exploded at the Fraunces Tavernin Lower Manhattan, on 24 January 1975.

By 1990, the movement was already changing with the times. \u201cWe realised other tactics to armed force could be more effective, mobilising people through peaceful campaigning. Morally, also, we came to see that we had to lead by example, that if we are advocating for a better world then there are things you cannot do. You cannot get a better world by being unjust yourself.\u201d</p> <p>When I ask him if he would pose a threat to the public were Obama to set him free, he replies: \u201cI don\u2019t think I could be a threat. We have transcended violence \u2013 it\u2019s crucial for people to understand, we\u2019re not advocating anything that would be a threat to anyone.\u201d</p> <p>He was picked up in 1981 at a traffic stop in Chicago and charged with seditious conspiracy \u2013 a very rare count of plotting against the US state that was first used after the civil war against southern refuseniks and then applied to anarchists and socialists before being turned against Puerto Rican <em>independistas </em>like himself. </p> <p>At trial, prosecutors presented no evidence that tied him to any deaths or injuries, or even specific attacks. For his part, he and his comrades refused to recognise the judicial process, calling himself a prisoner of war, offering no defence and declining even to attend the trial. He still describes seditious conspiracy as an \u201cimpossible crime\u201d. He told me: \u201cHow can a Puerto Rican be seditious towards the US state when we never had any part in electing a US government?\u201d</p> <p>He was sentenced to 55 years. By contrast, as his lawyer Jan Susler has pointed out, the average federal sentence for murder in 1981 was 10.3 years. Later, his sentence was extended to 70 years when, he insists, he was framed by agents provocateurs planted in his cell who cooked up a plot to escape and then implicated him in it.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8a24b14cc9a0a6848842f2825916138513ef5872\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8a24b14cc9a0a6848842f2825916138513ef5872/34_0_1980_1188/1000.jpg\" alt=\"L\u00f3pez Rivera was one of two dozen independistas in prison.

Not for L\u00f3pez Rivera. He recounts his time in prison with verve bordering on enthusiasm. Yes, he has faced \u201cterrible times\u201d, been labelled a terrorist by prison guards, called a \u201cspic\u201d and worse. But he has always made use of his life of incarceration, he says.</p> <p>\u201cWhen I first got to prison I made myself a promise: they can lock me up, but the time I spend in prison is my time. I use it to my own advantage, for my own goals. From the moment I get up to the moment I go to bed, I keep active.\u201d</p> <p>That means rising at 4am to an exercise regime of 40 minutes of stretching, pull- and push-ups, sidewinders and upper body routines. He reads a lot. Currently, he\u2019s reading Edward Said\u2019s Orientalism, and before that he devoured the New Yorker writer Jane Mayer\u2019s book on billionaire rightwing donors, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jan/17/dark-money-review-nazi-oil-the-koch-brothers-and-a-rightwing-revolution\">Dark Money</a>.</p> <p>He teaches other inmates to read and write or speak Spanish. He also likes to paint as a way of \u201ctaking myself out of prison into the outside world\u201d. He uses as his template photographs of landscapes or seascapes that he tears from magazines, making up for his lack of access to the natural world.<br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/apr/21/cuba-us-thaw-fugitives-william-morales\">Cuba-US thaw brings fate of cold war-era fugitives on the island into focus</a> </p> </aside>  <p>He caught the painting bug after the alleged escape plot when he was put into solitary confinement in two of the toughest supermax prisons in the US: Marion, Illinois, and Florence, Colorado. He would spend all but two hours a week in his concrete cell with no sight of the sky. \u201cLittle by little, colours start to fade. Your eyes begin to change how you see things. You see less colour; everything blurs into the yellow-grey of the cell walls.\u201d</p> <p>So he turned to painting as a way to bring colour back into his life. That\u2019s when he rediscovered his passion for the monarch butterfly, reproducing pictures of the insects as a reflection on their migration. \u201cI had to be strong. I always thought they were not going to destroy me, that was not going to happen.\u201d</p> <p>Though he is now out of solitary he has still had to deal with social deprivation. At its peak, he was one of two dozen <em>independistas </em>in federal prisons; now he is the last one. Over the years, he has seen his comrades walk free, their ranks gradually depleted, until in 2010 he became the only one left. He is sanguine about that. \u201cI have never felt abandoned or lonely. There is no regret inside my heart.\u201d</p> <p>To have no regret about his predicament is all the more extraordinary in that he could have been released in 2009. In August 1999, Bill Clinton did what L\u00f3pez Rivera\u2019s supporters are now urging Obama to do: he used his final days in office to grant <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/campaigns/keyraces2000/stories/faln091199.htm\">a presidential pardon to 11 Puerto Rican independence fighters</a>. L\u00f3pez Rivera was offered a lesser deal that would have seen him released after a decade, but he turned it down, because he says he had no faith in the US government sticking to its side of the bargain and he was unhappy about a couple of his fellow fighters being offered no commutation at all. \u201cWhen I was in Vietnam I never left anyone behind. That\u2019s not my practice, I couldn\u2019t do it,\u201d he says.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"de084da1ab7a5db52da7ffe9313f7db6f9f2e26d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/de084da1ab7a5db52da7ffe9313f7db6f9f2e26d/0_7_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018How can an insect so small go so far?\u2019 ... a monarch butterfly.

I believe in principles. For me, the decision was the one I had to make.\u201d</p> <p>So what now is the likelihood that Obama will follow in Clinton\u2019s footsteps and finally fling open the cell doors? One factor in Obama\u2019s calculation might be that Clinton\u2019s round of pardons sparked a fireball of opposition in Congress and the media. The \u201cClinton terror pardons\u201d remain a <a href=\"http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB120277819085260827\">bugbear</a> <a href=\"http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2013/06/04/still-blocking-the-truth/\">for the right</a> to this day, even though the vitriol overlooks one awkward fact about the releases: that not a single criminal act has been committed by any of the 11 former FALN militants in the 16 years that they have been out.</p> <p>The Clinton backlash perhaps explains Obama\u2019s apparent ambivalence on the matter. He is reported to have told Lin-Manuel Miranda that L\u00f3pez Rivera\u2019s clemency petition was <a href=\"http://www.elnuevodia.com/noticias/politica/nota/obamaatiendepedidodelinmanuelsobreoscarlopez-2175040/\">\u201con his desk\u201d.</a> But Congress member Luis Guti\u00e9rrez, who is of Puerto Rican descent and has been a leading proponent of a pardon, has said that when he asked Obama about the account the president firmly <a href=\"http://www.thedawn-news.org/2016/09/05/why-obama-lied-to-lin-manuel-miranda-an-interview-with-puerto-rican-congressman-luis-gutierrez-calling-to-demonstrate/\">disputed it</a> and gave a bland statement that \u201cprocedures must be followed\u201d.</p> <p>That sounds less than promising for the Mandela of Puerto Rico. But L\u00f3pez Rivera responds to the mixed messages emanating from the White House with trademark composure. \u201cI have no choice but to be optimistic,\u201d he says, as the Terre Haute guards call time on our conversation. \u201cHope, that is one thing we can never lose.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Priti Patel has said revealing Britain\u2019s negotiation position during talks with European Union leaders over the country\u2019s departure from the bloc would be akin to revealing her hand in a high-stakes game of poker.</p> <p>The international development secretary, who was a prominent leave campaigner and is said to be among the ministers on Theresa May\u2019s Brexit committee, said a debate in the House of Commons over the terms of UK\u2019s departure would give the game away to Brussels. </p> <p>\u201cIf I were to sit down and play poker with you this morning, I\u2019m not going to show you my cards before we even start playing the game,\u201d she told BBC1\u2019s Andrew Marr Show. </p> <p>Her comments came in the wake of an attempt by a powerful cross-party group of MPs to force a parliamentary vote on whether the government should reveal its plans for the UK\u2019s future outside the EU before negotiations begin, spearheaded by former party leaders Ed Miliband and Nick Clegg and including shadow Brexit secretary Keir Starmer, former Tory minister Nick Herbert and leave-backing Conservative MP Stephen Phillips. </p> <p>The MPs have called for the government to set out its negotiating position before the House before article 50 is triggered.</p> <p>Patel said MPs would not be denied a say in the Brexit process, including voting on the \u201cgreat repeal bill\u201d that would transpose EU law on to the British statute book after UK leaves the EU, giving the government the opportunity to examine laws separately and repeal legislation over time if desired. </p> <p>\u201cWe look at everything that happens in parliament and obviously the debates that are taking place now and the debates that people are alluding to as well,\u201d Patel said. \u201cWe will work with all colleagues. This isn\u2019t about a \u2018them or us\u2019 mentality whatsoever; we are listening to colleagues, respectfully.\u201d </p> <p>Clegg told the same programme on Sunday that MPs were not attempting to subvert the referendum vote. \u201cWhen John Major had to go to the rest of Europe and negotiate the Maastricht treaty, he first put in effect something very similar to a white paper to the House of Commons and said \u2018these are my objectives, this is the way I want to try and approach these talks, will you give me your backing or not?\u2019\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cAnd incidentally it\u2019s also exactly the same approach that Theresa May took under the coalition government when she negotiated the new deal on police and judicial cooperation in the EU. So the precedent is there and it\u2019s a very good precedent because it gives the government of the day much greater authority if it\u2019s negotiating with other governments with the backing of its parliament.\u201d</p> <p>Clegg said if the proposal was voted down, May would have to \u201cgo back and improve her negotiating stance\u201d and said that may entail article 50 being delayed beyond the end of March deadline set by May. </p> <p>\u201cYes, and by the way that would be a very good thing anyway because I think Theresa May has made already a fundamental tactical error by saying, frankly just to throw red meat to her backbenchers, that she\u2019s going to trigger article 50 in March of next year because she\u2019s already, in doing so, lost about a quarter of her negotiating timetable because as anybody in Europe \u2013 and I speak to many politicians across Europe \u2013 will tell you, nothing is going to meaningfully happen until the end of next year after the German elections.\u201d</p> <p>Greg Hands, minister of state for international trade, said the UK government was still working out its position on crucial details, including whether the UK would need to pay EU budget contributions in exchange for favourable trading conditions.<br></p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s difficult, at this stage ... we\u2019ve said we want to make sure that we know in advance before we trigger article 50 all of the pros and cons. The prime minister has been clear we need to get the best possible deal for the UK,\u201d he told ITV\u2019s Peston on Sunday. \u201cWe\u2019ve got time to be able to get the right answers to those questions.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/14/wells-fargo-profits-down-third-quarter-john-stumpf\">resignation last week</a> of the chief executive of Wells Fargo should have been a high point for the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB).<br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/14/wells-fargo-profits-down-third-quarter-john-stumpf\">Wells Fargo announces profit drop after CEO exits in fake accounts scandal</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The CFPB announced in early September that <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/09/business/dealbook/wells-fargo-fined-for-years-of-harm-to-customers.html?_r=0\">it would receive the lion\u2019s share of a $185m</a> fine levied on Wells Fargo as punishment for encouraging employees to open millions of savings and credit accounts for customers without their knowledge or consent. The rest went to Los Angeles regulators and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency.</p> <p>Then came congressional hearings, at which Stumpf \u2013 one of those rare individuals whom Democrats and Republicans could agree was a villain \u2013 embarrassed himself by fumbling the questions and passing the buck up to his board of directors and down to the rank-and-file employees who actually opened the accounts.</p> <p>Nor was that the only highlight for the CFPB of late. The agency has issued new rules governing prepaid cards, an alternative to checking accounts used by large numbers of \u201cunbanked\u201d Americans who can\u2019t afford the rising fees traditional banks levy on checking accounts, or for whom banks decline to open accounts. </p> <p>As the wealth gap has widened, the prepaid industry has soared, from being worth $1bn in 2003 to $65bn by 2012. Users tend to be among the more vulnerable members of society: making less than $50,000, renters rather than homeowners, minorities and women, according to <a href=\"http://www.pewtrusts.org/~/media/legacy/uploadedfiles/pcs_assets/2014/prepaidcardssurveyreportpdf.pdf\">research by the Pew Charitable Trusts</a>. </p> <p>In other words, they tend to be vulnerable to abuse or simple misunderstanding. The CPFB\u2019s new rules will require clear disclosure about what fees the card issuer will charge to check a balance, for instance, and ensure that losses will be limited to what a conventional debit card holder would face if their card was lost or stolen. </p> <p>So far, so good for the CPFB. A US appeals court, however, rained on the agency\u2019s parade, while members of Congress and others raised questions about whether the CFPB has embarked on some kind of power trip.</p> <p> The court was considering an appeal in a case involving whether the CFPB had the right to impose a $103m fine on mortgage service PHH, for allegedly taking kickbacks for directing customers to a particular insurance company. The case reached the US court of appeals for the District of Columbia, where a three-judge panel headed by Brett Kavanaugh, a George W Bush appointee, handed down its ruling last Tuesday.</p> <p>\u201cUnconstitutional\u201d, Kavanaugh thundered. Not the CFPB itself, but its structure, which is headed by a single individual, Richard Cordray, who serves for a fixed term. Typically, heads of such agencies serve either at the president\u2019s pleasure or as part of a group, such as the five-member Securities and Exchange Commission.</p> <p> So much for the brief, fleeting moment of bipartisanship as Democrats and Republicans joined in bashing Stumpf. </p> <p> If you believe Republicans, the CFPB \u2013 part of the Dodd-Frank reforms that followed the financial crisis of 2008 \u2013 is, in the words of Kavanaugh, a \u201cgrave threat to individual liberty\u201d, a phrase he used <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/business/hiltzik/la-fi-hiltzik-cfpb-20161012-snap-story.html\">once every three pages or so</a> in his 98-page decision. </p> <p> Investor\u2019s Business Daily agrees. The CFPB is an \u201cout-of-control\u201d and \u201cdangerous\u201d entity, it wrote \u2013 \u201c<a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/business/hiltzik/la-fi-hiltzik-cfpb-20161012-snap-story.html\">the Frankenstein\u2019s Monster of federal regulatory agencies</a>\u201d that is \u201calmost entirely unaccountable to the public\u201d.</p> <p> Translation: the CFPB\u2019s critics want to shut the agency down lest it become even more effective, and are taking a weird and sometimes mutually contradictory variety of approaches to doing so. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/us-money-blog/2016/oct/07/wells-fargo-banking-scandal-financial-crisis\">Wells Fargo banking scandal a financial crisis we can finally understand</a> </p> </aside>  <p> When the CFPB has been slower than it might have been to act, as in the case of Wells Fargo, Republicans have taken delight in accusing it of being \u201c<a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-wells-fargo-regulators-20160927-snap-story.html\">asleep at the switch</a>\u201d, in the words of Texas representative Jeb Hensarling, the CFPB\u2019s chief critic in the House.</p> <p> When the CFPB has been proactive in its core areas \u2013 mortgage lending, credit cards and student loans \u2013 this has also attracted criticism. For instance, while its mission didn\u2019t include looking at for-profit colleges, the agency\u2019s emphasis on student loans led it realize that a disproportionate number of problems were tied to entities such as Corinthian colleges and ITT Technical Institute, which took advantage of the student loan system while at the same time misrepresenting graduation rates. It sued both schools for predatory lending, prompting their collapses. </p> <p>Still, in at least one case, a federal judge (another George W Bush appointee) denied the agency access to information about how an accreditor signed off on programs offered by these colleges. </p> <p>\u201cAlthough it is understandable that new agencies like the CFPB will struggle to establish the exact parameters of their authority, they must be especially prudent before choosing to plow headlong into fields not clearly ceded to them by Congress,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2016/04/22/cfpb-lacks-authority-over-profit-college-accreditors-judge-rules\">tsk-tsked US district judge Richard J Leon.</a> </p> <p>Last week\u2019s ruling could have been a lot worse, and Hensarling is probably gnashing his teeth in fury, wishing that the DC court had gone further. Cordray will now serve at the president\u2019s pleasure, rather than for a fixed five-year term \u2013 unless the agency appeals and the decision is overturned. </p> <p>This isn\u2019t impossible: it\u2019s hard to argue how the presence of a single individual at the helm of an agency offers a threat to liberty, unless the agency under that individual restricted the ability of those it regulated to access the court system to complain about its judgments. The fact that PHH did precisely that in this instance is evidence that there\u2019s no tyranny at work.</p> <p>What Hensarling and his buddies are really irate about is that the CFPB gets its funding independently \u2013 that\u2019s the lack of accountability that Investor\u2019s Business Daily was getting huffy about. In other words, it\u2019s not politicized: the CFPB doesn\u2019t have to grovel to Congress annually to keep its budget. </p> <p>The agency has reason to be concerned. Even as Dodd-Frank expanded the list of SEC responsibilities, Congress, perhaps under pressure from the financial services industry, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/16/business/budget-cuts-to-sec-reduce-its-effectiveness.html\">actually <em>cut </em>the amount of money</a> it had to work with. </p> <p>The SEC\u2019s 2017 budget will be unchanged, it now seems. But yet again, that entity only narrowly escaped a cut.</p> <p>In contrast, the CFPB is financially independent of Congress, being funded directly by the Federal Reserve (and collecting its fines, as other agencies do) and that drives Hensarling and other opponents crazy. </p> <p>They may characterize that as being \u201cunaccountable\u201d to ordinary Americans, but I think it actually enables the agency to listen to ordinary Americans rather than to the Very Loud Voices of the lobbyists who have a disproportionate impact on Congress. </p> <p>So far, at least the CFPB doesn\u2019t seem to be using any \u201csuperpowers\u201d it might have to threaten my life, liberty or pursuit of happiness.</p>",

The result may be uneven but the piece is bold, playful and scorchingly ambitious.</p> <p>Spanning more than 150 years, Hickson\u2019s play focuses on a woman called May who travels effortlessly through time. We first see her as a 19th-century Cornish farmer\u2019s wife for whom the newly invented kerosene lamp becomes a source of personal illumination. Later, we see May working as a servant in 1908 Tehran, at a time when the British are desperate to exploit Persia\u2019s natural resources. By 1970, she has risen to become CEO of an international oil company threatened by Libya\u2019s proposal to nationalise its assets. But, as May rises in the world, difficulties with her daughter, Amy, intensify and become deeply problematic as they head into a nightmarish future.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b7a12ae559923f7a5f8efb7f6e1440746f87957b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b7a12ae559923f7a5f8efb7f6e1440746f87957b/0_142_4252_2552/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Yolanda Kettle as Amy and Anne-Marie Duff as her mother, May, in Oil at the Almeida.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018One of the best theatrical mother-daughter relationships of recent years\u2019 \u2026 Yolanda Kettle as Amy and Anne-Marie Duff as her mother, May, in Oil at the Almeida.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Richard H Smith</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Hickson suspends the normal rules of realism to pursue big ideas. One is that there is a parallel between the imperialist instinct of countries and corporations and that of parents. This is most vivid in the scene where May, on one crisis-ridden evening, simultaneously seeks to retain control of her company\u2019s Libyan oil wells and of her teenage daughter\u2019s love life. But Hickson is equally fascinated by the price that has to be paid for living through a century and a half of accelerating progress: in particular, she shows the career-driven, uncompromising May becoming habituated to loneliness and to a sense of estrangement from the activist Amy who, as her three-letter name implies, represents her other self.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/2015/oct/11/anne-marie-duff-i-was-just-so-bloody-minded\">Anne-Marie Duff: \u2018I was just so bloody-minded...\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Hickson strives too hard for cyclical neatness. The level of the writing also varies from one scene to another. But she has created a remarkable play that, aside from an opening scene that is as impenetrably dark as a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/jonathanjonesblog/2016/jun/28/brexit-cultural-heritage-art-georges-de-la-tour\">Georges de la Tour painting</a>, is very well directed by Carrie Cracknell and contains one of the best theatrical mother-daughter relationships of recent years. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/2015/oct/11/anne-marie-duff-i-was-just-so-bloody-minded\">Anne-Marie Duff</a> excellently catches all May\u2019s contradictions: her sensuousness and solitude, her curiosity and curmudgeonliness and the oppressive nature of her maternal love. Above all, Duff, with her taut, expressive features, is very good at suggesting hardship overcome. When May says: \u201cThere is still blood on my hands from hauling myself up, from clinging on,\u201d Duff makes you believe every word.</p> <p>Yolanda Kettle is equally good as daughter Amy: defiant, angry, passionate about the environment, yet imbued with a faint touch of self-righteous certainty. The men are less multi-dimensional, but there is good work from Tom Mothersdale as May\u2019s abandoned husband, Patrick Kennedy as her regimental pursuer and Nabil Elouahabi as a Libyan emissary. And even if Hickson\u2019s play is about the ultimate exhaustion of our oil reserves, it has a renewable energy of its own. </p> <ul> <li>At <a href=\"https://www.almeida.co.uk/whats-on/oil/7-oct-2016-26-nov-2016\">Almeida, London</a>, until 26 November.

But in speaking out about her experience, Heller joins <a href=\"http://edition.cnn.com/2016/10/14/politics/trump-women-accusers/\">eight other women</a> who have publicly accused Trump of inappropriate come-ons, touching, or kissing over the past several decades. The allegations have opened a chasm within the Republican party as the presidential campaign enters the crucial final weeks, and have inspired Trump to issue a series of fulminating denials. This week, Trump called some of the women who have accused him \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2016/oct/13/trump-sexual-misconduct-allegations-election-clinton-obama\">horrible, horrible liars</a>\u201d.</p> <p>But Heller does not believe Trump\u2019s many accusers are lying. </p> <p>Their alleged encounter took place almost two decades ago \u2013 Heller believes the year was 1997 and she was at a Mother\u2019s Day brunch \u2013 at Trump\u2019s Mar-a-Lago estate. Heller, her husband, her three children and her in-laws were among dozens of families seated at big round tables in what she and a relative who spoke to the Guardian recall was an open lobby.</p> <p>Trump made the rounds greeting members of his club. When he stopped at their table, Heller recalled, and her mother-in-law introduced her, she stood and extended her hand.</p> <p>\u201cHe took my hand, and grabbed me, and went for the lips,\u201d she claimed. </p> <p>Alarmed, she said she leaned backwards to avoid him and almost lost her balance. \u201cAnd he said, \u2018Oh, come on.\u2019 He was strong. And he grabbed me and went for my mouth and went for my lips.\u201d She turned her head, she claims, and Trump planted a kiss on the side of her mouth. \u201cHe kept me there for a little too long,\u201d Heller said. \u201cAnd then he just walked away.\u201d<br></p> <p>\u201cI was angry and shaken,\u201d she continued. \u201cHe was pissed. He couldn\u2019t believe a woman would pass up the opportunity.\u201d She added that he seemed to feel \u201centitled\u201d to kiss her. </p> <p>The Guardian heard accounts that matched Heller\u2019s from two other people: Susan Klein, the friend who was emailing with Heller, and a relative seated at the table with Heller that day. The relative, who declined to be named for fear of retaliation, recalled that Heller sat back down with a stunned look on her face.</p> <p>\u201cI remember she was really freaked out,\u201d said the relative. The relative didn\u2019t see Heller\u2019s entire interaction with Trump, but saw him get \u201cin her face\u201d and saw Heller pull away. \u201cHe was very forceful \u2026 She really was definitely affected by this man who was very aggressive toward her.\u201d</p> <p>Heller and the relative both recalled that no one at the table quite knew how to react. \u201cI was shook up,\u201d said Heller.

The club\u2019s rules state that the fees are refundable under certain circumstances when an individual is no longer a member, and Heller has placed at least one phone call to a club manager attempting to recover the money, totaling several thousand dollars.</p> <p>But Heller says her encounter with Trump predates that effort.</p> <p>\u201cMy motivations for speaking,\u201d she said, are to show \u201cit\u2019s not \u2018just talk\u2019\u201d, as Trump has claimed. \u201cIt\u2019s action.\u201d</p> <p>Klein, Heller\u2019s friend and neighbor, told the Guardian that she had heard the story long before the tape surfaced.</p> <p>Klein said she learned about Heller\u2019s alleged brush with Trump in the summer of 2015. It was shortly after Trump launched his run for the presidency, and Heller confided her story to the ladies\u2019 Mahjong group the women both belong to near their homes in New York. Klein recounted Heller\u2019s telling of story to the Guardian in similar detail.<br></p> <p>\u201cAnd when this tape came out, I couldn\u2019t believe it, because it was exactly what he said he did and had done to Cathy,\u201d Klein said.</p> <p>Klein forwarded a breaking news alert to Heller on 7 October, the day news of the tape broke. \u201cYou were one of Trump\u2019s victims,\u201d she wrote. \u201cHe said when he sees a pretty woman, he just kisses her, he doesn\u2019t even wait.\u201d</p> <p>Later that night, Heller replied: \u201cThe stories coming out go so well with how he treated me!\u201d</p> <p>On Saturday afternoon, the Trump campaign denied the accusation. \u201cThere is no way that something like this would have happened in a public place on Mother\u2019s Day at Mr Trump\u2019s resort,\u201d spokesman Jason Miller said in a statement. \u201cIt would have been the talk of Palm Beach for the past two decades.</p> <p>\u201cThe reality is this: for the media to wheel out a politically motivated Democratic activist with a legal dispute against this same resort owned by Mr Trump does a disservice to the public, and anyone covering this story should be embarrassed for elevating this bogus claim.\u201d</p> <p>Heller said that besides her January donation to Clinton, she had \u201calso bought a woman\u2019s card from Hillary,\u201d alluding to <a href=\"https://shop.hillaryclinton.com/products/the-woman-card\">a $5 card</a> sold by the campaign after Trump accused his rival of \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jan/03/donald-trump-hillary-clinton-woman-card-middle-east\">constantly playing the woman card</a>\u201d. </p> <p>She added that although she supports Clinton, she is not an activist \u2013 \u201cI\u2019ve never done any work for the Democratic Party\u201d \u2013 and that she is not pursuing any legal action against Mar-A-Lago.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/787359730465329152\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Nothing ever happened with any of these women.

For many, the tipping point came the Sunday night after the tape\u2019s release, in Trump\u2019s second presidential debate with Clinton. Pressed by CNN\u2019s Anderson Cooper to say whether he touched women without their consent, Trump denied that he had.</p> <p>\u201cNo, I did not,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI don\u2019t think you understood what was said. This was locker room talk \u2026 Certainly I\u2019m not proud of it. But this is locker room talk.<br></p> <p>Within days, several former competitors in the Miss USA and Miss Teen USA contests, pageants once owned by Trump, claimed that Trump had <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/12/donald-trump-miss-usa-dressing-room-2001-rehearsal\">barged into their dressing rooms</a> without warning while they were half-dressed or naked.

Jessica Leeds and Rachel Crooks <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/13/us/politics/donald-trump-women.html\">alleged to the New York Times</a> that Trump was sexually inappropriate toward them on a plane and in Trump Tower, respectively. </p> <p>Mindy McGillivary and the People writer Natasha Stoynoff claimed Trump grabbed them, and, in Stoynoff\u2019s case, forced a kiss on her, at separate events at Mar-a-Lago. In a tearful statement she read on Friday afternoon, Summer Zervos, a former contestant on The Apprentice, Trump\u2019s reality TV show, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/14/donald-trump-summer-zervos-apprentice-sexual-assault\">accused Trump</a> of using conversations about a job opportunity as cover to touch her breast and try to force her into his bedroom at a Beverly Hills hotel.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/13/list-of-donald-trump-sexual-misconduct-allegations\">A timeline of Donald Trump's alleged sexual misconduct: who, when and what</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Trump has reacted to these allegations with livid denials.

Jill Harth, a woman whose husband briefly partnered with Trump to produce a pageant, accused Trump in a 1997 lawsuit of attempting to rape her \u2013 a claim <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/20/donald-trump-sexual-assault-allegations-jill-harth-interview\">she has maintained</a> ever since.</p> <p>Heller, likewise, had been telling friends her story for months before a spotlight shone on Trump\u2019s behavior toward women.</p> <p>\u201cThis is not just something she said when she heard other women were coming out,\u201d Klein said. \u201cShe told us this a good year and a half ago.\u201d</p> <p>Heller also told her account to a Guardian reporter in February. But she declined to tell her story on the record.</p> <p>What ultimately swayed Heller to tell her story publicly, she said, were Trump\u2019s own denials. Hearing the tape, she said, made her feel \u201cvalidated and vindicated\u201d. But it was Trump\u2019s denials at Sunday night\u2019s debate that convinced her to speak up.</p> <p>\u201cHe said this is just talk, but it\u2019s not just talk,\u201d Heller said. \u201cThis was him.\u201d</p>",

  "<p>In 1996, when he was chairman of Channel 4, Michael Bishop wrote a stiff letter to his friend, the then prime minister, John Major, and in doing so was credited with saving the broadcaster from privatisation.</p> <p>Twenty years on, and with Channel 4\u2019s state-owned future yet again in doubt, the Conservative peer who took the title Lord Glendonbrook is again entering the fray. But this time, his solution is for a public-private partnership, with a golden share held by the government.</p> <p>So what is different? \u201cBritain doesn\u2019t need two publicly owned broadcasters,\u201d says the 74-year-old. The BBC is enough, because the market has changed so radically, and the internet and social media provide alternative means of reaching people as well as offering outlets for creative people with fresh content.</p> <p>He also vehemently disagrees with Channel 4\u2019s emphasis on running as a not-for-profit organisation, something he says the broadcaster began doing after he was ousted as chair in 1997, and which has since been cemented in the past six years under the chairmanship of Lord Burns. Bishop says he regards that ethos as a \u201cfig leaf lots of people have used to keep others from finding out what was going on\u201d.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Not for profit is not a corporate philosophy that is appropriate for Channel 4</p> <footer> <cite>Michael Bishop</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Channel 4 \u201cjust has to have private shareholders and it has to be run as any other public company\u201d in order to encourage more stringent financial discipline, and allow it the flexibility to grow, he says. \u201cNot for profit is not a corporate philosophy that is appropriate for Channel 4.\u201d</p> <p>The<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/sep/14/channel-4-under-fire-for-poaching-great-british-bake-off-from-the-bbc\"> reported \u00a375m deal to buy The Great British Bake Off</a> adds to his concern. This is despite him helping embed the broadcaster\u2019s cross subsidy model while he was chairman. \u201cI am critical of C4\u2019s decision. It is a huge amount of money, spent on something which is not a part of its remit. I can\u2019t obviously be black and white about it, but it raises an awful lot of awkward questions.\u201d</p> <p>His solution derives from his background in the airline industry and the Nats deal he helped strike in 2001 with the then chancellor, Gordon Brown, as an alternative to privatisation. This saw the UK\u2019s air traffic control system reborn as a public-private partnership. The government retains a 49% golden share, the airline group investors a 42% stake, with the rest held by staff and the UK airport operator.</p> <p>The golden share is in place because air space is crucial to national security. Channel 4 is not in that bracket but some version could be created, to protect its public services remit. The company would then run as a conventional profit-and-loss business, paying dividends.</p> <p>Bishop wrote to Major when a sale was under consideration to buttress public finances. At the time an ambitious MP, John Whittingdale, had tabled an amendment to the 1996 broadcasting bill proposing privatisation.</p> <p>As a dedicated Tory donor and wealthy founder of airline BMI, Bishop used his political capital inhis \u201cDear John\u201d letter to argue that privatisation of Channel 4 was wrong because the broadcaster did not fit into the category of needing public support, and was serving viewers well. </p> <p>\u201cIt was a very important decision made in 1996. From time to time you have to write passionate letters,\u201d he says, over a series of conversations (including one accompanied by his favourite toasted tea cakes in the House of Lords).</p> <p>But he has changed his mind. He thinks Channel 4 has been treated badly, especially by Whittingdale, who was culture secretary in David Cameron\u2019s last government. \u201cThe only possible excuse [for speaking out] is that I and I alone stopped the privatisation last time. Clearly that particular episode is now up for review, and possible change.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cb6622328839584846c8739cffa0f6e606001aad\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cb6622328839584846c8739cffa0f6e606001aad/0_228_4368_2621/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Channel 4 headquarters in London, now a \u00a3100m asset.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Channel 4 headquarters in London, now a \u00a3100m asset.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Graham Turner/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>During Bishop\u2019s period as chairman he ensured Channel 4 built its own freehold headquarters in London, now a \u00a3100m asset. He does not support the threatened government imposed move to Birmingham. \u201cLondon is media city,\u201d he says. </p> <p>He also says Whittingdale has \u201cused Channel 4 as a bit of a feint for the real primary objective to knuckle down a [charter] agreement with the BBC.</p> <p>\u201cAs a basic starting point if you are going to review a significant business, which Channel 4 is, I don\u2019t think it is reasonable to leave the board of directors and executives knowing you are under scrutiny.</p> <p> \u201cIt can\u2019t go on like this, pushed from one review to another. The management needs to know. So do those who work for Channel 4 and those who supply it. There are long-term contracts. It is just something that shouldn\u2019t be allowed to happen.</p> <p> \u201cIt is perfectly reasonable for the board and management to lobby for the status quo because what happens in all businesses, nobody likes change. </p> <p>\u201cYou could also make a point it is the duty of a new chairman of the board [Charles Gurassa] to come in and look at options, new chairmen don\u2019t usually come in to uphold the status quo, especially when [change] has been widely canvassed.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It can\u2019t go on like this, pushed from one review to another.

So they should bring that back if that is what they feel is right. I don\u2019t. What I have always said is that creative business thinking has to take place.\u201d</p> <p>But does anyone want to pick up his NATS-based solution? Would there be media companies, with a common interest, ready to take share stakes? </p> <p>He outlined his proposal to Whittingdale last year, and has spoken to Gurassa, an acquaintance from the airline business. He says Michael Grade, who also fought against privatisation in 1996 when chief executive, but is now in favour, \u201cbelieves it is not suitable because of changes in the digital world and all the rights issues that surround Channel 4. I think the industry finds it too difficult to handle. </p> <p>\u201cI think if a business has assets and can make a profit, then there ought to be suitable partners who would like to be in that venture. Everyone says you can\u2019t do, when you suggest something radical. Well go and find out and take a look.\u201d</p> <p>He is also dubious about Channel 4\u2019s growth fund investment in independent production companies, saying it is better \u201cin all areas of corporate life\u201d to stick with what you are good at.</p> <p>But underlying his concern, is there a belief there is still a reason for Channel 4 and its remit?</p> <p> \u201cYes, because it is a very good brand. C4 is 35 years old, all companies, all organisations and culture evolves. And it is not to be expected that the sheer fact C4 pioneered so many things that have now come into the mainstream, means that it is not time to look at something different or at least carefully scrutinise it. </p> <p>\u201cI am interested in what happens to C4, I felt it was one of the business things I did in my life that did change things. And now the next generation has pivotal moments of their own, but they are falling back on the old formula.</p> <p>\u201cChannel 4 does need to think more constructively about exiting from state control, but in an orderly fashion. Government could get dividends. I only give a view.\u201d</p> <p></p>",
  "<p>My grandmother <a href=\"http://time.com/4065338/margaret-sanger-clinic-history/\">served a month in jail 100 years ago</a>. Her crime? Opening the first birth control clinic in the US. Her name was Margaret Sanger, and she was the founder of <a href=\"https://www.plannedparenthood.org/\">Planned Parenthood</a>. That first clinic was open for just 10 days in 1916 before the police shut it down; its very existence was considered a \u201cpublic nuisance\u201d. Today, Planned Parenthood is the single-largest provider of reproductive healthcare services in the country.<br></p> <p>At 81, when she was very ill, I saw her give her last speech. \u201cThe law was wrong,\u201d she said, standing in front of a crowd in the ballroom of the Waldorf Astoria hotel in New York City, \u201cand I broke it.\u201d She recounted her early struggles and the multiple arrests she endured, all to bring reproductive healthcare to women. I have never forgotten that day. Even into her 80s, my grandmother was always on the move. No sooner would she come to visit us in the suburbs than she would hop on a train to New York, an hour away, to attend a meeting, give a speech or lobby her supporters. She was indefatigable.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2016/may/22/sexual-health-little-attention-crisis-devastating-results-reproductive-healthcare-world-humanitarian-summit\">Sexual health gets little attention in a crisis, with devastating results | Tewodros Melesse</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Her example led me to join her unfinished fight. As chair of the <a href=\"http://www.ippf.org/\">International Planned Parenthood Federation</a> (IPPF) council for the past 15 years and president of <a href=\"https://www.plannedparenthood.org/planned-parenthood-new-york-city\">Planned Parenthood of New York City</a> for a decade before that, I have helped continue my grandmother\u2019s legacy. However, she would be appalled that, a century after the founding of Planned Parenthood in Brownsville, Brooklyn, the fight for reproductive rights is far from over. <br><br>When you live to be 100, you have either good genes or are doing something very right. For an organisation, it is both. Three million women a year, every year, need Planned Parenthood in the US. We have no national health service. Women are forced to rely on charities to fill the gaps that our federal, state, county and municipal clinics don\u2019t cover. Its mission, to get birth control information to the poor and needy, should have been taken over by government health services, much like countries in western Europe. In the rare US cities where municipal clinics do offer birth control, like New York City, women still come to Planned Parenthood because they know they will get unbiased advice and full options.</p> <p>It shouldn\u2019t be this way. But Planned Parenthood is doing something right and the US government is doing something, if not exactly wrong, then certainly inadequately. This is made all the more plain by a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/20/texas-maternal-mortality-rate-health-clinics-funding\">recent report</a> showing that Texas, a state in the richest country on Earth, has the highest maternal mortality rate in the developed world.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Let all women decide for themselves: that is Planned Parenthood\u2019s mantra</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Of course, the severe stigma surrounding women\u2019s reproductive rights and health isn\u2019t limited to the US. At least <a href=\"http://www.who.int/reproductivehealth/topics/unsafe_abortion/magnitude/en/\">47,000 women die every year from unsafe abortion</a>, many in countries where it is legal. US political posturing around reproductive rights negatively impacts countless women beyond US borders.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2014/may/15/barack-obama-us-abortion-aid-helms-amendment\">Helms amendment</a>, passed in 1973, prohibits US foreign aid from going to organisations that provide safe abortion among their reproductive healthcare services \u2013 even if abortion is legal in the recipient country. The exportation of a policy inconsistent with US law means women suffer, whether in Syria, where <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/feb/17/disarm-isis-rape-weapon-war\">rape is a weapon of war</a>, or in Latin America, where the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2016/oct/11/zika-brazil-babies-microcephaly-one-year-later\">Zika virus threatens the health of women and babies</a>. The US should prioritise policies that help to reduce, not exacerbate, the severe health challenges and unnecessary deaths caused by limited access to reproductive healthcare services \u2013 including safe abortions \u2013 in all countries.</p> <p>My grandmother insisted that women could not call themselves free until they could decide whether or not to be a mother. That was her mantra. Born poor, Irish, Catholic, tubercular, with an 11th-grade education, my grandmother was a tough and determined woman. She witnessed injustice and was determined to fix it. As a nurse, she saw women having children they didn\u2019t want or, all too often, dying from illegal abortions. \u201cEnough,\u201d she said. Her eye was on women and their babies.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9112bf80478febc6b72a9b6ad055b0e94c9f768a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9112bf80478febc6b72a9b6ad055b0e94c9f768a/0_624_2920_1751/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Margaret Sanger\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">When Planned Parenthood founder Margaret Sanger opened a family planning clinic in Brooklyn in 1916, it was promptly shut down.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bettmann Archive</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Let all women decide for themselves: that is Planned Parenthood\u2019s mantra, and it transcends national borders. My grandmother was also one of the founders of International Planned Parenthood, launched in 1952. Just last week, I visited IPPF\u2019s member association in Morocco, called the <a href=\"http://www.ippf.org/about-us/member-associations/morocco\">Association Marocaine de Planification Familiale</a>. The association not only operates a reproductive health clinic, but also runs a community school for orphans and offers training facilities in hairdressing, dressmaking and cooking, providing career paths for underprivileged boys and girls. The Moroccan people trust and respect our organisation, as do people in 172 countries where IPPF operates.</p> <p>To the poor and underserved, to the young and marginalised, to the minorities and immigrants that the US government doesn\u2019t reach, my grandmother said: \u201cWe are here for you, all of you, no questions asked.\u201d</p> <p>A century ago, she was persecuted for this by the government, the churches, and many of her fellow citizens. She went to jail. When she got out, she continued the fight. At Planned Parenthood, we have fought the government, politicians, protestors and many anti-choice institutions, including churches and corporations. We have plenty more to do, nor least repealing the <a href=\"https://www.plannedparenthoodaction.org/issues/abortion/hyde-amendment\">Hyde amendment</a>, which prohibits Medicaid \u2013 social healthcare for US citizens of limited resources \u2013 from including abortion services, thereby depriving poor women of the right and means to decide on whether and when to have children.</p> <p>Our international movement has never backed away from the fight to give women a choice. And we aren\u2019t tired, even at 100 years old.<br></p> <p><em></em></p>",

  "<p>Devastating hurricane? More than 1,000 lives lost? It must be climate change! Almost inevitably, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/hurricane-matthew\">Hurricane Matthew</a>\u2019s recent rampage across the Caribbean and south-eastern US has been fingered by some as a backlash of global warming driven by humanity\u2019s polluting activities, but does this really stack up?</p> <p>The short answer is no. Blame for a single storm cannot be laid at climate change\u2019s door, as reinforced by the bigger picture. The current hurricane season is by no means extraordinary, and the last few seasons have actually been very tame. The 2013 season saw no major hurricanes at all and tied with 1982 for the fewest hurricanes since 1930. This, in turn, is no big deal as there is great year-on-year variability in the level of hurricane activity, which responds to various natural factors such as El Ni\u00f1o and the so-called Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation, as well as the progressive warming of the oceans as climate change bites harder.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/10/un-haiti-aid-hurricane-matthew\">Hurricane Matthew's devastation in Haiti forces UN to call for $120m in aid</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The current consensus holds that while a warmer world will not necessarily mean more hurricanes, it will see a rise in the frequency of the most powerful, and therefore more destructive, variety. This view was supported recently by Kerry Emanuel, a hurricane scientist at MIT, who pointed to Matthew as a likely sign of things to come.</p> <p>Debate within the hurricane science community has in recent decades been almost as hostile as the storms themselves, with researchers, on occasion, even refusing to sit on the same panels at conferences. At the heart of this sometimes acrimonious dispute has been the validity of the Atlantic hurricane record and the robustness of the idea that hurricane activity had been broadly ratcheting up since the 1980s. Now, the weight of evidence looks to have come down on the side of a broad and significant increase in hurricane activity that is primarily driven by progressive warming of the climate. For many, the bottom line is the sea surface temperature, which is a major driver of hurricane activity and storm intensification. Last year saw the warmest sea temperatures on record, so it should not be a surprise. As Michael Mann, an atmospheric scientist at Penn State University, says: \u201cIt isn\u2019t a coincidence that we\u2019ve seen the strongest hurricane in both hemispheres [western and eastern] within the last year.\u201d As the Atlantic continues to heat up, the trend is widely expected to be towards more powerful and wetter storms, so that Matthew might seem like pretty small beer when looked back on from the mid-century.</p> <p>As with hurricanes, Pacific typhoons and the mid-latitude storms that periodically batter the UK and Europe are forecast to follow a similar pattern in an anthropogenically warmed world. Storm numbers may not rise, but there is likely to be an escalation in the frequency of the bigger storm systems, which tend to be the most destructive. An additional concern is that mid-latitude storms may become clustered, bringing the prospect of extended periods of damaging and disruptive winds. The jury is out on whether climate change will drive up the number of smaller, but potentially ruinous vortices of solid wind that make up tornadoes, although an apparent trend in the US towards more powerful storms has been blamed by some on a warming atmosphere.</p> <p>Tornadoes, typhoons, hurricanes and mid-latitude storms \u2013 along with heatwaves and floods \u2013 are widely regarded as climate change\u2019s shock troops; forecast to accelerate the destruction, loss of life and financial pain as planet Earth continues to heat up. It would be wrong to imagine, however, that climate change and the extreme events it drives are all about higher temperatures and a bit more wind and rain.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>An earthquake fault that is ready to go is like a coiled spring \u2013 all that is needed is the pressure of a handshake</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The atmosphere is far from isolated and interacts with other elements of the so-called \u201cEarth system\u201d, such as the oceans, ice caps and even the ground beneath our feet, in complex and often unexpected ways capable of making our world more dangerous. We are pretty familiar with the idea that the oceans swell as a consequence of the plunging atmospheric pressure at the heart of powerful storms, building surges driven onshore by high winds that can be massively destructive. Similarly, it does not stretch the imagination to appreciate that a warmer atmosphere promotes greater melting of the polar ice caps, thereby raising sea levels and increasing the risk of coastal flooding. But, more extraordinarily, the thin layer of gases that hosts the weather and fosters global warming really does interact with the solid Earth \u2013 the so-called geosphere \u2014 in such a way as to make climate change an even bigger threat.</p> <p>This relationship is marvellously illustrated by a piece of research published in the journal <a href=\"http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v459/n7248/full/nature08042.html\"><em>Nature</em> in 2009</a> by Chi-Ching Liu of the Institute of Earth Sciences at Taipei\u2019s Academia Sinica. In the paper, Liu and his colleagues provided convincing evidence for a link between typhoons barrelling across Taiwan and the timing of small earthquakes beneath the island. Their take on the connection is that the reduced atmospheric pressure that characterises these powerful Pacific equivalents of hurricanes is sufficient to allow earthquake faults deep within the crust to move more easily and release accumulated strain. This may sound far fetched, but an earthquake fault that is primed and ready to go is like a coiled spring, and as geophysicist John McCloskey of the University of Ulster is fond of pointing out, all that is needed to set it off is \u2013 quite literally \u2013 \u201cthe pressure of a handshake\u201d.</p> <p>Perhaps even more astonishingly, Liu and his team proposed that storms might act as safety valves, repeatedly short-circuiting the buildup of dangerous levels of strain that otherwise could eventually instigate large, destructive earthquakes. This might explain, the researchers say, why the contact between the Eurasian and Philippine Sea tectonic plates, in the vicinity of Taiwan, has far less in the way of major quakes than further north where the plate boundary swings past Japan.</p> <p>In a similar vein, it seems that the huge volume of rain dumped by tropical cyclones, leading to severe flooding, may also be linked to earthquakes. The University of Miami\u2019s Shimon Wdowinski has noticed that in some parts of the tropics \u2013 Taiwan included \u2013 large earthquakes have a tendency to follow exceptionally wet hurricanes or typhoons, most notably the devastating quake that took up to 220,000 lives in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/ng-interactive/2015/jan/16/the-haiti-earthquake-five-years-on-then-and-now\">Haiti in 2010</a>. It is possible that floodwaters are lubricating fault planes, but Wdowinski has another explanation. He thinks that the erosion of landslides caused by the torrential rains acts to reduce the weight on any fault below, allowing it to move more easily.</p> <p>It has been known for some time that rainfall also influences the pattern of earthquake activity in the Himalayas, where the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/nepal-earthquake-2015\">2015 Nepal earthquake</a> took close to 9,000 lives, and where the threat of future devastating quakes is very high. During the summer monsoon season, prodigious quantities of rain soak into the lowlands of the Indo-Gangetic plain, immediately to the south of the mountain range, which then slowly drains away over the next few months. This annual rainwater loading and unloading of the crust is mirrored by the level of earthquake activity, which is significantly lower during the summer months than during the winter.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2015/apr/29/nepal-earthquake-drone-footage-shows-devastation-ancient-town-bhaktapur-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/48xty\"                        data-video-id=\"2284464\"            data-video-name=\"Nepal earthquake: drone footage shows devastation in ancient town of Bhaktapur - video\"            data-video-provider=\"Effect International\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-456562623\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2015/04/29/150429NepalDrone_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2015/04/29/150429NepalDrone_small.3gp\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2015/04/29/150429NepalDrone_large.3gp\"/><source src=\"http://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=10317338&amp;format=video/m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2015/04/29/150429NepalDrone_synd_768k_vp8.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2015/apr/29/nepal-earthquake-drone-footage-shows-devastation-ancient-town-bhaktapur-video\">Nepal earthquake: drone footage shows devastation in ancient town of Bhaktapur</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>And it isn\u2019t only earthquake faults that today\u2019s storms and torrential rains are capable of shaking up. Volcanoes seem to be susceptible too. On the Caribbean island of Montserrat, heavy rains have been implicated in triggering eruptions of the active lava dome that dominates the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jan/28/montserrat-volcano-british-territory-geothermal-energy-tourism-sand-mining\">Soufri\u00e8re Hills volcano</a>. Stranger still, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/mar/29/alaska-volcano-eruption-less-intense-more-flight-cancellations\">Alaska\u2019s Pavlof volcano</a> appears to respond not to wind or rain, but to tiny seasonal changes in sea level. The volcano seems to prefer to erupt in the late autumn and winter, when weather patterns are such that water levels adjacent to this coastal volcano climb by a few tens of centimetres. This is enough to bend the crust beneath the volcano, allowing magma to be squeezed out, according to geophysicist Steve McNutt of the University of South Florida, \u201clike toothpaste out of a tube\u201d.</p> <p>If today\u2019s weather can bring forth earthquakes and magma from the Earth\u2019s crust, it doesn\u2019t take much to imagine how the solid Earth is likely to respond to the large-scale environmental adjustments that accompany rapid climate change. In fact, we don\u2019t have to imagine at all. The last time our world experienced serious warming was at the end of the last ice age when, between about 20,000 and 10,000 years ago, temperatures rose by six degrees centigrade, melting the great continental ice sheets and pushing up sea levels by more than 120m.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The bottom line is that as climate change tightens its grip, we must be prepared to expect the unexpected</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>These huge changes triggered geological mayhem. As the kilometres-thick Scandinavian ice sheet vanished, the faults beneath released the accumulated strain of tens of millennia, spawning massive magnitude eight earthquakes. Quakes of this scale are taken for granted today around the Pacific Ocean\u2019s \u201cRing of Fire\u201d, but they are completely out of place in Santa\u2019s Lapland. Across the Norwegian Sea, in Iceland, the volcanoes long buried beneath a kilometre of ice were also rejuvenated as the suffocating ice load melted away, prompting a \u201cvolcano storm\u201d about 12,000 years ago that saw the level of activity increase by up to 50 times.</p> <p>Now, global average temperatures are shooting up again and are already more than one degree centigrade higher than during preindustrial times. It should come as no surprise that the solid Earth is starting to respond once more. In southern Alaska, which has in places lost a vertical kilometre of ice cover, the reduced load on the crust is already increasing the level of seismic activity. In high mountain ranges across the world from the Caucasus in the north to New Zealand\u2019s southern Alps, longer and more intense heatwaves are melting the ice and thawing the permafrost that keeps mountain faces intact, leading to a rise in major landslides.</p> <p>Does this all mean that we are in for a more geologically active future as well as a hotter and meteorologically more violent one? Well, no one is suggesting that we will see a great surge in the number of earthquakes and volcanic eruptions. As always, these will be controlled largely by local geological conditions. Where an earthquake fault or volcano is primed and ready to go, however, climate change may provide that extra helping hand that brings forward the timing of a quake or eruption that would eventually have happened anyway.</p> <p>As the world continues to heat up, any geological response is likely to be most obvious where climate change is driving the biggest environmental changes \u2013 for example, in areas where ice and permafrost are vanishing fast, or in coastal regions where rising sea levels will play an increasing role. Freysteinn Sigmundsson of the Nordic Volcanological Centre observes that the centre of Iceland is now rising by more than three centimetres a year in response to shrinking glaciers. Studies undertaken by Sigmundsson and his colleagues forecast that the reduced pressures that result will lead to the formation of significant volumes of new magma deep under Iceland. Whether this will translate into more or bigger eruptions remains uncertain, but the aviation chaos that arose from the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/iceland-volcano\">Eyjafjallaj\u00f6kull eruption in 2010</a> provides a salutary warning of the disruption that any future increase in Icelandic volcanic activity may cause across the North Atlantic region.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"adb7667c3a501fe490c849a5e6a3ff3fbc57a3c6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/adb7667c3a501fe490c849a5e6a3ff3fbc57a3c6/0_0_2917_1750/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ash rises from  the Eyjafjallaj\u00f6kull volcano in Iceland in 2010\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A cloud of ash rises from the volcano under the Eyjafjallaj\u00f6kull glacier in Iceland in May, 2010, causing chaos for millions of airline passengers as flights were cancelled across Europe.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ingolfur Juliusson/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Volcanologist Hugh Tuffen, of Lancaster University, is worried about the stability of the more than 10% of active volcanoes that are ice-covered. He says that \u201cclimate change is driving rapid melting of ice on many volcanoes worldwide, triggering unloading as ice is removed. As well as encouraging magma to rise to the surface, leading to increased volcanic activity, removal of ice can also destabilise steep volcano flanks, making hazardous landslides more likely.\u201d</p> <p>The potential for more landslides is also likely to be a problem in high mountain ranges as the ice cover that stabilises rock faces vanishes. Christian Huggel of the University of Zurich has warned that \u201cin densely populated and developed regions such as the European Alps, serious consequences have to be considered from [future] large slope failures\u201d.</p> <p>Looking ahead, one of the key places to watch will be Greenland, where recent findings by a research team led by Shfaqat Khan of Denmark\u2019s Technical University reveal a staggering loss of 272bn tonnes of ice a year over the last decade. GPS measurements show that, like Scandinavia at the end of the last ice age, Greenland and the whole of the surrounding region is already rising in response to the removal of this ice load. Andrea Hampel of the University of Hannover\u2019s Geological Institute, who with colleagues has been studying this behaviour, is concerned that \u201cfuture ice loss may trigger earthquakes of intermediate to large magnitude if the crust underneath the modern ice cap contains faults prone to failure\u201d.</p> <p>More earthquakes in Greenland might not seem like a big deal, but this could have far wider ramifications. About 8,200 years ago, an earthquake linked to the uplift of Scandinavia, triggered the Storegga Slide; a gigantic undersea sediment slide that sent a tsunami racing across the North Atlantic. Run-up heights were more than 20m in the Shetlands and six metres along the east coast of Scotland, and the event has been blamed for the flooding of Doggerland; the inhabited Mesolithic landmass that occupied what is now the southern North Sea.</p> <p>The submerged margins of Greenland are currently not very well mapped, so the likelihood of a future earthquake triggering a landslide capable of generating a major tsunami in the North Atlantic is unknown. Dave Tappin, a tsunami expert at the British Geological Survey, points out that one large, undersea landslide has been identified off the coast of Greenland, but suspects that there may not be sufficient sediment to generate landslides as large as Storegga. Nonetheless, the seismic revival of Greenland is certainly a geological response to climate change that we need to keep an eye on.</p> <p>The bottom line in all of this is that as climate change tightens its grip, we should certainly contemplate more and bigger Hurricane Matthews.

  "<p>Ched Evans, the international footballer who was cleared this week of raping a 19-year-old woman after a retrial, has said there should be more education on issues surrounding alcohol and consent, adding: \u201cWhen they are drunk, think twice about it.\u201d</p> <p>Evans, who was found guilty of rape in 2012, had his conviction quashed in April after judges ruled evidence relating to the complainant\u2019s sexual history could be included in the second trial. </p> <p>The case was referred to the court of appeal after a 10-month investigation by the Criminal Cases Review Commission, which found new information not raised at the original trial. <a href=\"https://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiOyoO5997PAhWGWxQKHYqQCt4QqQIIHTAA&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Ffootball%2F2016%2Foct%2F14%2Ffootballer-ched-evans-cleared-of-in-retrial&amp;usg=AFQjCNFF2pQja_Yp5cffjCV01LagDsH5Kg&amp;sig2=DWojaJmG-aHpTKXNy-E1jQ&amp;bvm=bv.135974163,d.bGs\">Evans was ultimately found not guilty of rape</a> on Friday.</p> <p>The footballer, who was 22 at the time of the incident in 2011 and one of Sheffield United\u2019s top players, said he had done a lot of growing up since then. When called in for questioning in his hometown of Rhyl with fellow footballer Clayton McDonald, who was found not guilty at the original trial, Evans told police: \u201cWe could have had any girl we wanted ... We\u2019re footballers.\u201d</p> <p>Now he says he wants to speak to young players, who may hold a similar attitude, about the risks they are taking when consent is not clear. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/16/ched-evans-jessica-ennis-apology-pooh-90-obesity\">Let me lay down the law on casual sex: care and respect | Barbara Ellen</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cI have got an idea of what goes on in prison,\u2019 he told the Mail on Sunday. \u201cIt was a situation I found myself in. A crime was not committed but nevertheless I was in a situation. I know 100% that lads and girls get themselves in that position. Until something comes of it you never think something will happen to you.\u201d</p> <p>Central to the prosecution\u2019s case was that the waitress, who woke up alone in a hotel room in Rhyl and claims she had no memory of how she got there and what had happened, was unable to give consent for sex because she was too drunk.</p> <p>He said: \u201cI was young at the time and I was stupid and I wasn\u2019t aware of the situations you could potentially find yourself in that would land you in trouble. I have never been taught about anything like that. You get your gambling and drinking training but nothing else on top of that. In this day and age people need educating on alcohol and consent.</p> <p>\u201cI read somewhere you would have to get signed consent. That wouldn\u2019t be realistic but someone needs to come up with something. The best thing is just to be educated. And when they are [too] drunk to think twice about it. How would it look in a court of law?\u201d</p> <p>On the night in question, Evans was out with McDonald and another footballer, Javan Vidal, who would later receive a suspended prison sentence for knocking a woman to the ground and kicking her that night. Evans had become separated from his friends when he received a text from McDonald which read \u201cI got a bird\u201d.</p> <p>Evans decided to go to the Premier Inn in Rhyl, where he had booked a room for his former Manchester City team-mate. Once there, he let himself into the room where McDonald was having sex with the complainant. According to the men, McDonald asked if it was OK if his friend joined in, which he did. Evans did not say a single word to her before, during or after intercourse and left through a fire escape door.</p> <p>The woman claimed she woke up on her own unable to remember anything about the incident. She said her bag was missing and she feared her drink had been spiked so she went to the police, who later charged the men with rape. </p> <p>Although he has now been found not guilty of the crime, Evans admitted his behaviour was unacceptable but said he would not apologise to the woman concerned for what happened in the hotel room. Since Evans was arrested, she has been subject to online abuse and had to move at least five times and change her name. Despite 10 people, some of whom were friends of Evans, being taken to court and fined for identifying her, she continues to be named online even though she is entitled to lifelong anonymity under the Sexual Offences (Amendment) Act 1992.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>\u201cI have maintained my innocence from day one so I can never apologise directly for what happened but I can apologise for the effect it\u2019s had,\u201d Evans said of the complainant. </p> <p>\u201cThe social media stuff, I don\u2019t condone whatsoever. I don\u2019t agree with it. It\u2019s not been easy for her. I know that. I think it was a situation that got taken out of our hands from an early stage. She never said anybody raped her. She said she had a blackout but that didn\u2019t mean, like it was said in court, that she didn\u2019t consent. My behaviour that night was not acceptable \u2013 but it wasn\u2019t a crime.\u201d</p> <p>After being found guilty in the original trial, he spent two-and-a-half years in prison. His fiancee, Natasha Massey, whom he was with at the time of the incident, stayed with him, and her millionaire father launched a well-funded legal and PR campaign to clear his name, including offering a \u00a350,000 reward for information leading to his acquittal. </p> <p>Evans\u2019s comments made in his first interview following the acquittal came as legal experts and campaigners condemned the inclusion of evidence from the complainant\u2019s previous sexual partners in court, which is normally restricted and is only allowed in exceptional circumstances. Both men were known in the footballer\u2019s circle.</p> <p>During the retrial, she was questioned in detail and at length about whom she had had sex with, the positions she favoured and the language she used during sex. Women\u2019s rights campaigners believe this could stop women reporting rape and other offences for fear they will find themselves in the same situation.</p> <p>According to the former solicitor general Vera Baird, in the past many defendants in rape trials have called on their friends to testify to the woman\u2019s promiscuity in order to undermine her credibility.</p> <p>She told BBC News: \u201cThe only difference between a clear conviction of Mr Evans in 2012 and the absolute refusal of him having any leave to appeal at that time, and his acquittal now, is that he has called some men to throw discredit on [the woman\u2019s] sexual reputation. We\u2019ve gone back, I\u2019m afraid, probably about 30 years.\u201d</p> <p>The QC told the Observer that the \u201cexceptional\u201d nature of the case must be made clear, but said the verdict was likely to deter some women from coming forward about rape and sexual assault. </p> <p>The next step is for Evans\u2019s legal team to investigate the possibility of claiming damages. Any claim for loss of earnings would be capped at \u00a3500,000. An application has been put in for court costs that will be taxpayer-funded and are likely to run into hundreds of thousands of pounds.</p>",

  "<p>Gordon Ker feels a bit guilty about <a href=\"http://theblacklock.com/\">Blacklock</a>\u2019s OFM gong, and no wonder. \u201cTo be honest, when we started in spring 2015, we never intended to open on Sundays,\u201d he admits. \u201cWe\u2019re a small team, and Soho is dead on a Sunday.\u201d</p> <p>What a difference a year and a half makes: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/mar/08/blacklock-restaurant-review-jay-rayner\">Blacklock</a> is now a Soho Sunday institution, with 300-plus sitting down to a proper roast dinner each week. \u201cThe dream was to do a roast like you get at home,\u201d says Ker, 31. \u201cNothing beats your mum\u2019s Sunday dinner, so we aim to be the next best thing.\u201d Ker is ex-<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2012/nov/18/jay-rayner-restaurant-hawksmoor-air-street\">Hawksmoor</a>, so it almost goes without saying that this is a slick operation.</p> <p>The Sunday menu is gratifyingly to the point, and served family-style: just a couple of starters (bone marrow on sourdough, maybe, or roast scallops), followed by a choice of roast beef, pork or lamb (or a daunting plateful of all three), with all the traditional roast spud, carrot, greens, Yorkshire and gravy trimmings. There\u2019s a touch of theatre about it, too, with the joints slow-roasted whole over open coals, which is perhaps not the way home cooks do it. For pudding: \u201cIt\u2019s cheesecake.\u201d Portion control is similar to Mum\u2019s, too \u2013 you won\u2019t be wanting an evening meal after this little lot.</p> <p>It\u2019s also one of the best Sunday deals in town: that vast mixed platter with sides is \u00a320 all-in. \u201cIt\u2019s all about value,\u201d Ker says. \u201cWe do cocktails from a fiver, we use top-quality meat at a middle-end price point [all Blacklock\u2019s carcasses come from one of the godfathers of British butchery, Philip Warren in north Cornwall], and extra sides are \u00a34 a pop.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s enough to make competitors weep. Dave Strauss, operations manager for the group that runs <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2009/mar/08/goodman-restaurant-london\">Goodman</a> and Burger &amp; Lobster, says they trialled a Sunday roast at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/jan/10/zelman-meats-restaurant-review-jay-rayner\">Zelman Meats</a> earlier this year, only to jack it in after a month or so. \u201cThere\u2019s no way we could match Blacklock, so we\u2019re sticking with Sunday steaks. What\u2019s the point in even trying to compete? Have you tried their gravy? It\u2019s ridiculous.\u201d</p> <p>Ker agrees. \u201cOur gravy is off the scale,\u201d he laughs. \u201cWe did a catering gig recently where our sauces were accidentally poured down the drain, so we called up the restaurant, had a batch of gravy sent over, and served it with Yorkshires.

The company gives out bags for primary school students to take home leftover food from lunch, like bread or fruit.</p> <p>\u201cTeaching the value of food is fundamental,\u201d explains Milano Ristorazione director Gabriella Iacono. \u201cChildren learn at school to not waste fruit and to value everything: at the end of a meal when they throw away food scraps and biodegradable plates in the wet waste bin, they learn that everything can be reused for nature.\u201d</p> <p>The global \u201cugly food\u201d movement, promoting the consumption of misshapen produce usually thrown away, has taken off across Europe \u2013 from the <a href=\"http://itm.marcelww.com/inglorious/\">inglorious fruits and vegetables campaign</a> by French supermarket Intermarch\u00e9, which led to France <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/feb/04/french-law-forbids-food-waste-by-supermarkets\">banning supermarket food waste</a>; to the UK\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/feb/05/asda-puts-uks-first-supermarket-wonky-veg-box-on-sale\">\u201cwonky veg box\u201d scheme</a> and the Spanish social enterprise-run brand Es Imperfect, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/jul/15/food-waste-harvesting-spains-unwanted-crops-to-feed-the-hungry\">which sells jams, soups and sauces made from recovered produce</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2bb8f84483cddc09d204afdb006803e27c3d44ad\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2bb8f84483cddc09d204afdb006803e27c3d44ad/0_0_800_600/500.jpg\" alt=\"Italian NGO Banco Alimentare\" width=\"500\" height=\"375\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">In Milan, close to 60,000 people benefit from the work of NGO Banco Alimentare, which supplies donated food to those in need.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Banco Alimentare</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In Milan, the Frutta Brutta (ugly fruit) project is led by a group of fruit producers from the Lombardy region who are selling imperfect apples in the city\u2019s farmers markets at a lower price (\u20ac0.80 per kilo, while the regular price for \u201cnormal\u201d apples is around \u20ac2.50 per kilo). Farmers involved in this initiative, launched in September 2014, aim to save more than 50 tonnes of apples from now until April 2017 through the scheme \u2013 which also gives a kilo of apples to local charities for every kilo sold at the markets.</p> <p>Many of the local initiatives addressing food waste in Milan also focus on having a strong social impact. The Italian NGO <a href=\"http://www.bancoalimentare.it/it\">Banco Alimentare</a> organises mass-scale collections of food surplus across the country in order to donate them to networks of local charities and soup kitchens, or directly to families in need. Around 54,000 people in Milan benefit daily from the work of Banco Alimentare, which deals mostly with large-scale retailers through a system involving more than 700 volunteers in the Lombardy region. The organisation is currently planning to collaborate with the city government and the Polytechnic University to test a local-scale model of food waste reduction in a suburban neighbourhood of the city; it would offer residents a real-time list of shops where food surplus is available.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2016/oct/11/hell-earth-great-urban-scandal-life-rubbish-dump\">'Hell on earth': the great urban scandal of family life lived on a rubbish dump</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The use of apps to combat food waste is also creating new opportunities for grocery shops in Milan. <a href=\"https://www.myfoody.it/#/landing\">MyFoody</a> alerts local residents to food in small supermarkets in danger of being wasted \u2013 either because it\u2019s going out of date or the packaging is damaged.

  "<p>In a packed theatre in the basement beneath the <em>Observer</em>\u2019s offices, I am watching a live sex show. Well, a live show about sex. It\u2019s not that raunchy, to be honest. On stage, three friends \u2013 Jamie Morton, James Cooper and Alice Levine \u2013 sit on comfy chairs. Morton reads out a supposedly erotic story, which involves several members of a sales team. (They trade in pots and pans: hot!) Other characters include Belinda Blumenthal \u2013 our enthusiastic and uninhibited heroine \u2013 and a woman who\u2019s leading a training day. Belinda, the trainer and, indeed, the whole sales team soon move on from a dice game to something more intimate, unlikely and hilarious.</p> <p>As Morton reads the chapter, he, Cooper and Levine make comments. There is much that demands a response: the inappropriate vocabulary (are rivets a suitable metaphor for nipples?), the strange details (one character removes his clothes but decides to sit on a sock), the anatomically ludicrous sauciness. At one point, a couple of audience members are asked on stage to try to act out what\u2019s happening in the chapter. They can\u2019t, because the moves are physically impossible. At the start of the evening, a drinking game is established, where every time Belinda blinks, or there\u2019s an unnecessary detail about an item of furnishing (this happens more often than you might imagine), everyone is required to have a drink. The audience \u2013 one or two who are actually dressed as Belinda \u2013 join in with enthusiasm. It\u2019s fun.</p> <p>This entire evening all stems from just one chapter in the adventures of Belinda Blumenthal. Her naughty escapades form what could loosely be called the plot of <em>Belinda Blinked</em>, an erotic novel written by Rocky Flintstone. And yes, that\u2019s a pseudonym. In real life, Flintstone is a retired father of four. One of his children is Jamie Morton.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f590ca51068a71bd6580beee41ce6a78eec28875\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f590ca51068a71bd6580beee41ce6a78eec28875/0_1009_7902_4743/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jamie Morton holds two halves of a pomegranate in front of his own chest looking faux sad;  Alice Levine and James Cooper sit either side of him with a hand on his shoulder\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018For the podcast, we just go round to each other\u2019s houses and have a nice meal and a catch-up\u2019: (from left) Alice Levine, Jamie Morton and James Cooper.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: P\u00e5l Hansen/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><a href=\"http://www.mydadwroteaporno.com/\"><em>My Dad Wrote a Porno</em></a> is, for Morton, the truth. His dad did write a porno \u2013 \u201cWell, a dirty book\u201d, says Morton. On retirement, his dad decided he was going to write a novel, along the lines of \u201c50 Colours of Grey,\u201d as he called it. It didn\u2019t take him too long and, once he was done, he emailed a few chapters to his only son \u2013 who ignored them, as you would. When Morton finally plucked up the courage to open the <em>Belinda Blinked</em> files, he took them to a Christmas lunch, where he read out parts to his friends, including Cooper and Levine. Soon after, they turned it into a <a href=\"http://www.mydadwroteaporno.com/\">podcast</a>. Each week, Morton reads out a chapter and the three friends comment.</p> <p>\u201cBut the show isn\u2019t really porn, though,\u201d says Levine, a few days later, when I meet them in a caf\u00e9. \u201cThe title is click-baity, but the content isn\u2019t that shocking\u2026\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Mum said: \u2018This is disgusting, I want no part of it!\u2019 and went up to her bedroom</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cMy dad doesn\u2019t really write sex,\u201d says Morton. \u201cIt\u2019s very much an anatomical exercise.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe might have been desensitised though,\u201d points out Cooper. \u201cI mean, before this show I would never have said the words tit-clit. We\u2019ve been coarsened.\u201d</p> <p>The podcast \u2013 three friends laughing about something they all find funny \u2013 could easily have fallen into an \u201cin-joke\u201d podcast. But Morton edits and produces the show, ensuring that each programme is far from the waffling self-indulgence of that familiar (and boring) model. It helps that the three are very funny together. There is nothing laddy about it either. Often, Morton and Cooper are confused. \u201cSometimes the boys are like\u2026 well, Alice?\u201d says Levine. \u201cAnd I\u2019m, like, I can\u2019t speak for everyone, I\u2019m sure some people are into that, but I can\u2019t put my name to that action!\u201d</p> <p>Anyway, from the moment it launched, in 2015, <em>My Dad Wrote a Porno</em> has been a success. This, despite the lack of publicity. Initially, iTunes wouldn\u2019t list it because of its rude title, but it\u2019s now No 1 on the UK chart. Advertisers ran a mile for similar reasons. But listeners loved it. It\u2019s been downloaded 18m times and there are numerous spin-offs, including merchandise and a book: essentially <em>Belinda Blinked</em>, in all its appalling glory, with notes from the trio. There is talk of a musical, perhaps a TV show.</p> <p>To be honest, there is a lot of talk about a lot of things. Morton, Cooper and Levine spiral off into many topics, as funny in real life as they are on air. They met at Leeds University more than a decade ago, in the TV department, and they clearly still enjoy each other\u2019s company. \u201cFor the podcast, we just go round to each other\u2019s houses and have a nice meal and a catch-up,\u201d says Morton. \u201cI get drunk and the other two don\u2019t, then we set up the mics.\u201d</p> <p>Their first job in London after university was for <a href=\"https://bebo.com/\">Bebo</a>, where they had to send people\u2019s messages into space. Since then, they\u2019ve made YouTube shows and dramas together, as well as pursuing their own, separate media careers (<a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b03hjf53\">Levine is a Radio 1 presenter</a>). Savvy but not cynical, they knew that <em>MDWAP</em> could be a success from the pilot episode. To check his family would be OK about it, Morton played the pilot to his three sisters, as well as both his parents, all at once. \u201cMy mum said: \u2018This is disgusting, I want no part of it!\u2019 and went up to her bedroom. So it was just me, my sisters and my dad. But then my mum crept back down! That\u2019s the only episode she\u2019s heard.\u201d</p> <p>The podcast also has extra shows that talk around the books. These sometimes have celebrity guests, such as Elijah Wood, who Levine met when he came in to do an interview for her Radio 1 show, and <em>Star Wars</em>\u2019 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/daisy-ridley\">Daisy Ridley</a>, who contacted the show via Instagram. All are actual fans of the show, as opposed to star bookings. \u201cEveryone\u2019s obsessed with Rocky, to be honest,\u201d says Morton. Rocky perfected his celebrity signature on a family holiday.</p> <p>And how long will <em>MDWAP</em> last? As long as Rocky keeps \u2019em coming.</p> <p>\u201cWe actually can\u2019t stop him from writing,\u201d says Morton. \u201cWe\u2019ve tried, legally\u2026 No, he\u2019s written number five in the series. There\u2019s definitely another year of it. He\u2019s in his pavilion as we speak, well his garden shed, bashing them out until he\u2019s called in for his tea. He\u2019s not allowed to write in the house.

  "<p>In 1974, when exotic travel could be had for little cost, I found myself in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2015/dec/12/sayulita-mexico-pacific-coast-puerto-vallarta-charter-flights\">Puerto Vallarta</a>, then a sleepy town hugging the Pacific. At the time, I was working as a waitress so that I could earn enough money to return to university, which I did in 1975 at the University of California, Berkeley.</p> <p>It wasn\u2019t long before I learned that Peter O\u2019Toole was on location shooting<em> </em><a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0074849/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1\"><em>Man Friday</em></a> (he played the role of Robinson Crusoe). Though young and impressionable, I wasn\u2019t just any old fan. I adored the actor. How could anyone ever forget those piercing blue eyes and his flowing <em>Lawrence of Arabia</em> garb? Or his fabulous acting in <em>The Ruling Class</em>?</p> <p>A bit more sleuthing uncovered his nightly visits to the popular Carlos O\u2019Brien\u2019s restaurant. Throughout my stay I headed there regularly on the off chance of running into him. On the beach, I\u2019d imagine my brief encounter with the world-class actor: \u201cMr O\u2019Toole,\u201d I\u2019d say gazing into his dreamy eyes, \u201cI\u2019m sure you hear this all the time, but in my case it\u2019s absolutely true: you are my favourite actor in the world.\u201d My imagination never moved beyond this moment because it was the stuff of fantasy.</p> <p>Finally, my last night arrived without so much as a glimpse. Time to become more proactive. I ran around the restaurant begging each waiter to inform me should Peter O\u2019Toole come around. I drank a margarita and waited. At midnight a waiter scurried over. \u201cHe\u2019s here!\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I could feel people watching us as he guided me out of the restaurant and into his car</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The actor was easy to spot as he towered over everyone and walked with a graceful swagger. \u201cThanks,\u201d I said and hurried towards him and delivered the line I\u2019d rehearsed and stared into his eyes, not the startling blue I\u2019d imagined, but still penetrating and showing a bit of amusement at my youthful boldness. He leaned over and kissed me once on each cheek, then took me by the arm to a nearby sofa. \u201cLet\u2019s have a chat, shall we?\u201d he said.</p> <p>My heart pounded in my chest. Whatever should I say? He rescued me by asking where I was from, so I explained my European origins \u2013 how I\u2019d been born in Yugoslavia, that we\u2019d emigrated to Germany, and then to the US. Yawn. I felt him slipping away. Then, to my amazement, he asked me to go dancing.</p> <p>\u201cYes,\u201d I said, latching on to his arm and my unbelievable good luck. I could feel people watching us as he guided me out of the restaurant and into a vehicle driven by a man who functioned as driver and bodyguard.</p> <p>At the disco we danced and danced. I honestly couldn\u2019t believe this was happening. I liked the way his lanky body moved and from time to time he smiled. It was much too loud to talk. It\u2019s true his eye roved a bit, but I didn\u2019t mind, because here I was dancing till 3am with Peter O\u2019Toole \u2013 a tale to tell my grandchildren, should I ever have any.</p> <p><em>Herta Feely is the author of </em>Saving Phoebe Murrow<em>, published by Twenty7, \u00a37.99.

News leaked in June that DiCaprio had accepted and he is due to arrive in Edinburgh next month as the guest speaker at the Scottish Business Awards, one of Littlejohn\u2019s sidelines. Meanwhile, the very strange story of Social Bite, a social enterprise that employs homeless people and donates all its profits to charity, becomes ever more like a Hollywood movie script.</p> <p>For Clooney\u2019s visit to Social Bite, last November, crowds formed outside the Rose Street shop at 6am. By the time his car pulled up, there was hysteria.

It was on CNN, I had my cousins in South Africa saying, \u2018Just heard you on the news.\u2019 It must have been a slow news day. All that really happened was that George Clooney had a sandwich!\u201d</p> <p>There\u2019s not too much A-list stardust at the winner of OFM\u2019s Outstanding Achievement award on the morning I visit. A group of Edinburgh\u2019s homeless linger outside: one in a hoodie and bobble hat puts down his can of Strongbow and goes in to collect a free sandwich and coffee. These meals are covered by customers who \u201cpay forward\u201d donations and Social Bite\u2019s Christmas appeal. The handouts are supposed to be capped at one per day, but Littlejohn notes good-naturedly that often the same faces will turn up at one branch for breakfast and another for lunch. \u201cNow no homeless person gets turned away,\u201d he says. Social Bite also gives away any food it hasn\u2019t sold that day when it closes at 3pm.</p> <p>But the mission of Social Bite \u2013 whose food costs about the same as Pret a Manger and Eat \u2013 is to be much more than an upmarket soup kitchen. The first cafe opened in August 2012, the idea of Littlejohn and his then-girlfriend Alice Thomson. They were, Littlejohn says now, \u201cclueless\u201d: his experience amounted to studying economics at Edinburgh University and watching his father, Simon, who owns restaurants across Scotland. The inspiration for giving away their profits came from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/jul/18/muhammad-yunus-microfinance-bangladesh\">Muhammad Yunus,</a> the Bangladeshi social entrepreneur who pioneered microlending.</p> <p>It hadn\u2019t been the plan to employ homeless people, but a <em>Big Issue</em> seller called Pete stationed himself outside the shop and, after a couple of weeks, he asked Littlejohn and Thomson for a job. Pete handed out leaflets for a couple of hours a day and then, when a position opened up, he became a pot washer. He also moved in with Littlejohn and Thomson to their one-bed flat while they tried to find him somewhere permanent. The experiment worked and Pete recommended his brother Joe. Littlejohn and Thomson set a goal that a quarter of Social Bite\u2019s employees should come from homeless backgrounds.</p> <p>Meeting this criteria as a small business has been a challenge; in fact, many days it\u2019s a nightmare. No-shows are a recurring problem and new hires are prone to storming out. \u201cIt\u2019s extremely chaotic to get them to fit into the employment environment where they have to turn up every day,\u201d admits Littlejohn.</p> <p>But for some the job has turned their lives around. One of these is 51-year-old Colin Childs, who was Social Bite\u2019s third employee from a homeless background and now works filling focaccias in the central production kitchen. Childs had been a drug addict and had not had steady work for more than 20 years. \u201cI\u2019ve seen a lot of people come and go,\u201d he says. \u201cThey can\u2019t handle the work, they are used to dossing about the street or whatever. But Social Bite gives you the tools to change your life and it\u2019s up to you if you want to take it. And I took it.\u201d</p> <p>For Littlejohn \u2013 Thomson remains on the board, but is no longer involved day to day \u2013 the secret is \u201cendless chances, endless patience\u201d. He shakes his head, \u201cWhen I think of some of my staff and the challenges they\u2019ve had to overcome to still be on their feet, you start looking at them with awe rather than, \u2018For fuck\u2019s sake, you\u2019ve slept in again.\u2019 You\u2019re still standing \u2013 that\u2019s amazing!\u201d</p> <p>When Littlejohn launched Social Bite, he had plans for 100, maybe even 500 cafes in the UK: \u201cWe thought, \u2018Let\u2019s take on Starbucks!\u2019\u201d He has since decided that five shops \u2013 two each in Edinburgh and Glasgow, one in Aberdeen \u2013 will better allow him to consolidate the work with his staff.</p> <p>He has also launched a craft lager called Brewgooder, which donates all its profits to clean-water initiatives, and in September he, along with business partners, opened a more formal restaurant in Edinburgh named Home. This also employs people from the street and encourages donations from diners in the form of meal promises; every Monday afternoon, the doors are then opened to feed the homeless.</p> <p>As for future marketing stunts, how do you top DiCaprio?</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s not many places left to go,\u201d Littlejohn concedes.</p> <p>Then he smiles, \u201cObama would be the obvious one. It sounds funny but it\u2019s not beyond the realms of possibility.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>The time has come to loosen our grip on reality. All the signs are there.

And therein lies the problem. Not that healthy things actually are delicious \u2013 that\u2019s patently not true. Sometimes it might seem like they are \u2013 nuts, for example, often give this impression \u2013 and then you discover the deliciousness is all because of some salt or sugar or duck fat that\u2019s been added in cardiovascularly hazardous quantities. Healthy things are delicious if either a) they\u2019re deep fried, or b) there\u2019s nothing else to eat. Couscous salad is much better than no food at all but, on the modern culinary battlefield, it\u2019s a mere flint-headed arrow to the state-of-the-art cruise missile that is a fried egg sandwich.</p> <p>No, the challenge for the Taste Buddy is not that lentils actually are tastier than chips, but that some people say they are and, in some cases, come to believe it. Their own mental powers of self-delusion rival Taste Buddy\u2019s thermal and electric trickery. And that\u2019s because many people define their identities by their eating choices.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/oct/04/rudd-announces-crackdown-on-overseas-students-and-new-work-visas\">Amber Rudd announces crackdown on overseas students and work visas</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Whether consciously or not, some healthy eaters\u2019 healthy eating is primarily an expression of control, cleanliness and virtue. It doesn\u2019t just make them feel better, it makes them feel better than other people. If eating steamed broccoli is suddenly no hardship, because it can be made to taste like baked Alaska, they\u2019re going to be deeply offended. It would be like offering a devout order of self-flagellating monks an inexhaustible supply of local anaesthetic.</p> <p>Frankly, Taste Buddy will be seen as cheating. These penitents won\u2019t like it that those of us with coarse, lifespan-reducing palates will get the benefit of nutrients we haven\u2019t earned, now that gruel is no longer gruelling. A market will immediately open up for some scientists to discover that it\u2019s actually tasting the lettuce rather than swallowing it that matters most.</p> <p>The most rabid salad eaters and the haute cuisine sector will combine to incentivise anyone who\u2019ll claim \u201cthere are still no shortcuts\u201d when it comes to eating well, that the brain needs the taste of roughage, or just that Taste Buddy might give you tongue cancer. Which, I suppose, it might. As might a sexist joke on a lolly&#xa0;stick.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"146b74bb468582472bb25ecc75a9f519cfd99f28\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/146b74bb468582472bb25ecc75a9f519cfd99f28/0_0_3543_4724/750.jpg\" alt=\"Illustration by David Foldvari\" width=\"750\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Illustration by David Foldvari</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Illustration: David Foldvari</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>And maybe they\u2019d have a point. A spoonful of sugar may help the medicine go down, but it probably screws up the placebo effect. Who knows how crucial those feelings of sacrifice, self-denial and moral superiority (lost for ever if Taste Buddy turned everything delicious) actually are to the health-enhancing powers of a balanced diet. In a carefully conducted study, it could probably be measured. But that sounds rather elitist, doesn\u2019t it? Measuring things with cold objectivity, as if that can ever matter as much as a sincere conviction of the&#xa0;heart.</p> <p>If you think that\u2019s all a bit touchy-feely, or tasty-thinky, you may be surprised to learn it\u2019s an approach Theresa May is very keen on. Last week the <em>Times </em>reported that the Home Office was concealing a report it had commissioned into the number of foreign students who break the terms of their visas and remain in Britain illicitly after their courses have finished. The number the report had come up with was about 1,500 annually, rather than the tens of thousands that had previously been estimated and generally bandied about. That was not what the Home Office, or the prime minister, wanted to hear.</p> <p>Why not? It\u2019s good news, isn\u2019t it? Well not if you\u2019ve just <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/oct/04/rudd-announces-crackdown-on-overseas-students-and-new-work-visas\" title=\"\">cracked down on the admission of foreigners to British universities</a>, with potentially disastrous consequences for the latter\u2019s funding. The notion that this drastic policy might have almost no effect on reducing net immigration was extremely unwelcome and, the government clearly felt, best kept quiet.</p> <p>Particularly as, among likely Tory voters, there\u2019s a broad perception that foreign students stay here and scrounge. Many people feel that feckless young foreigners are dragging us down and the government has come up with a harsh&#xa0;little policy to address that. Why let the fact that it\u2019s not true get in the way?</p> <p>Surely, Theresa May must think, it\u2019s not the business of government to start telling the public it\u2019s wrong. In an increasingly virtual world, feelings are as valid as facts. Let\u2019s focus on what people perceive to be the case and concentrate on adding to that a perception that something is being done about it. That\u2019s efficient democratic accountability for post-truth Britain.</p> <p>No need to contradict people about what they reckon is going on, denying&#xa0;problems they believe exist and citing others they were previously untroubled by. Policy doesn\u2019t need to reflect reality any more than the currency needs to be&#xa0;backed by gold. Just listen to their fears, confirm them and then&#xa0;use them to make the government seem vital. People will swallow anything if you control how it tastes.</p>",
  "<p>America\u2019s most likely next first family are retracing familiar steps. For <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton\">Hillary Clinton</a>, the road to the White House has taken her to a masonic shrine in Pennsylvania where she spoke during her 2008 primary campaign. Some 250 miles west, husband Bill begins a bus tour for her through Ohio by following the route of a trip in his 1992 presidential campaign. Two hours east, their daughter has just done her bit at a rally in the suburbs of Philadelphia where she brought her mother-in-law and breastfeeding son along to watch.</p> <p>Chelsea was 12 years old when the family last moved to 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue and there is a mounting sense of excitement that \u2013 if recent polling is to be believed \u2013 her parents could soon be back, with roles reversed. After a disastrous week of mishaps for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump\">Donald Trump</a>, the Clintons are campaigning hard in his blue-collar heartland in the hope of blocking off their opponent\u2019s path to the grandest of Washington addresses.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"99dbb722982c2277e6edb99379490f261dbda552\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/99dbb722982c2277e6edb99379490f261dbda552/673_88_2510_1507/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Somebody\u2019s daughter: Chelsea Clinton campaigning at Haverford, Pennsylvania.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Somebody\u2019s daughter: Chelsea Clinton campaigning at Haverford, Pennsylvania.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jamie-James Medina/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It is a complicated domestic routine. Bill will spend the night on his own at Youngstown\u2019s Courtyard Marriott, watching the vice-presidential debate and then reading until late to finish a book on the American civil war. Though they both travel with a vast retinue of advisers, reporters and guards, it doesn\u2019t stop Bill\u2019s bus getting a puncture and Hillary\u2019s convoy getting lost as they both hurry to make it home together the following evening. Hillary, who only finished a course of antibiotics for pneumonia three weeks ago, won\u2019t make it back to their house in the leafy New York commuter village of Chappaqua until midnight.</p> <p>But this is what they do. Even Chelsea is being groomed into the family business. Before speaking outside Philly, she was introduced by her mother as \u201can expert on healthcare\u201d, the same subject that established Hillary\u2019s reputation as a fearsome public policy wonk. Bill interjects rather more clumsily on the issue now, and has to spend the week modifying some overly blunt criticism of Obamacare that embarrasses his wife\u2019s campaign.</p> <p>Blending the personal and the political works well for mother and daughter, though. They next take a question from <a href=\"http://www.philly.com/philly/news/politics/presidential/20161009_Sen__Leach_s_daughter__Not_a_Clinton__plant__at_Haverford_event.html\">Brennan Leach</a>, a 15-year-old child actor in the audience who just happens to be the daughter of a local senator.

The 42nd president makes clear he already feels like he\u2019s slipping back into a warm bath. \u201cI feel like I\u2019m in my very own TV show, or maybe a movie,\u201d says Bill Clinton as he strolls past a phalanx of cameras into a barbershop in Youngstown during the second day of the bus tour.</p> <p>Later that afternoon at an organising office in Warren, he meets a volunteer for his wife\u2019s campaign.

Looking tired at the fifth stop of the second day in Ohio, he seems to forget which state he is in. \u201cI just took a trip before I started on this bus tour of Colorado,\u201d he says, beginning an anecdote about an Air Force One ride that leaves the union hall scratching their heads. \u201cI can tell you, having lost it, that youth matters,\u201d adds the 70-year-old later.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"985085ed87abfe2f0b110f96d2cf1cab96d0f2c1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/985085ed87abfe2f0b110f96d2cf1cab96d0f2c1/0_308_2376_2967/801.jpg\" alt=\"Off message: Trump supporters demonstrate.\" width=\"801\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Off message: Trump supporters demonstrate.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jamie-James Medina/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Real or imagined, the past catches up.

Clinton also ducks a question about a recent Donald Trump allegation that Hillary has been cheating on Bill. \u201cHe should run his campaign, and she\u2019ll run hers,\u201d he tells a reporter who brings it up on the first day.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We need answers not anger, says Bill as a Trump supporter is led out of the meeting</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Harder to ignore are the angry placards along the roadside in this struggling manufacturing region. \u201cWhere are all the jobs Bill?\u201d reads one, a question to which he has long, prepared answers to prove he feels their pain.</p> <p>During a stop at an Italian restaurant, he diverts to the kitchen to quiz staff on how much they earn.

  "<h2>Suzanne Vega, singer-songwriter: \u2018I see goddesses and queens and women revered in his music\u2019</h2> <p>I am thrilled for Bob Dylan and I think it\u2019s very appropriate that he\u2019s being praised for the literary excellence of his work. The citation credits him with having created \u201cnew poetic expressions within the great American song tradition\u201d and that\u2019s exactly what he\u2019s done. He\u2019s not being honoured as a musician but for the depth and breadth of his vision and the eloquence of the language with which he expresses it. He has every literary device in his songs: character, narrative, style.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"531d59c24f18e85f71669f154c2fee41b763f159\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/531d59c24f18e85f71669f154c2fee41b763f159/360_1915_5783_5781/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Suzanne Vega photographed for the Observer New Review by Pal Hansen in the Observer offices studio.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Take <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/aug/24/bob-dylan-early-draft-for-a-hard-rains-a-gonna-fall-shows-telling-changes\">A Hard Rain\u2019s a-Gonna Fall</a>: there are so many images there. \u201cI saw a white ladder all covered with water\u201d \u2013 there\u2019s something very mysterious about that image and it\u2019s so effective just to have it with no explanation. In the same song you have \u201cI saw guns and sharp swords in the hands of young children\u201d \u2013 those lines are so prophetic, especially in America today. We\u2019ve had horrific incidents where <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/may/02/toddler-shooting-gun-control-children\">toddlers in the back seat</a> have picked up a gun and shot one of their parents. So every time I see one of these terrible gun shootings, I think of that.</p> <p>Dylan was a big influence for me. He opened up this incredible, imaginary world. I was nine or 10 when I first heard Mr Tambourine Man and I had a vision of him dancing \u201cbeneath a diamond sky with one hand waving free\u201d. It sounded so beautiful, so free. I thought that\u2019s a world I want to be in.</p> <p>My mother always thought that Dylan was somewhat misogynistic, but I don\u2019t see that. I see a whole range of female characters in his music from goddesses and queens and women revered and then also women used, abused. I would love it if other songwriters who had a similar literary bent could win the Nobel prize. Like <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/jan/16/lucinda-williams-25th-anniversary-review\">Lucinda Williams</a>. She has a literary dimension to her work that elevates the form out of just being a pop song to something with so much more depth.</p> <h2>Kathryn Williams, singer-songwriter: \u2018There\u2019s a simplicity and an honesty to his songs\u2019</h2> <p>It\u2019s a massive, joyous feeling to see someone I admire so much achieve this. Bob Dylan has marked so many pivotal times in my life; he has inspired me and introduced me to different artists, whether it\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/jul/07/woody-guthrie-centenary-protest-songs\">Woody Guthrie</a> or <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2014/feb/28/kenneth-tynan-dylan-thomas-under-milk-wood-observer\">Dylan Thomas</a>. My mum and dad were fans, so his albums have been with me through the years, as I was turning from a child into an adult. I used to work in a bar called Pilgrim in Liverpool and I\u2019d put Lay Lady Lay on the jukebox every morning when I was cleaning the bar and this gorgeous, treacly, chocolatey voice would just seep into me.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"89452ad5bd1adb67c475a02a407ef431090620d4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/89452ad5bd1adb67c475a02a407ef431090620d4/194_1466_2486_2486/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Kathryn Williams\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>I\u2019m at a writers\u2019 retreat at the moment and we had been talking about Bob Dylan even before the news. [Singer-songwriter] Polly Paulusma was saying that what people forget with lyrics is the triangulation: there\u2019s the lyric, the music and the voice.</p> <p>Performance poetry can work in a similar way, but on paper it might not have the same strength. I\u2019ve got a book of Dylan\u2019s lyrics and whenever I read them it\u2019s not in my formal internal book voice, I hear his voice and character and intonation and the way he bends words to the music.</p> <p>All the people who are being snobby and saying it\u2019s ridiculous for a folk artist to be awarded this need to have a rethink: I mean, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/may/15/mighty-dead-why-homer-matters-adam-nicolson-review\">Homer</a>, all of his stuff was song. There have been so many profound writers through time who could transcend lyric, music and voice into a different form.</p> <p>There\u2019s a simplicity and an honesty in lots of Dylan\u2019s songs, like \u201cThe only thing I knew how to do / Was to keep on keepin\u2019 on like a bird that flew\u201d on Tangled Up in Blue. Where on Just Like a Woman he sings \u201cWhen we meet again / Introduced as friends / Please don\u2019t let on that you knew me when / I was hungry and it was your world\u201d: the first bit could be any sort of love song, then he just blasts it away and lifts it to a different level. And he does that sort of thing all the time.</p> <p>I don\u2019t know if I would want to meet my hero: when it comes to his treatment of women, like the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/gallery/2015/sep/04/the-life-and-times-of-joan-baez-songwriter-musician-and-activist-in-pictures\">Joan Baez</a> stuff, sometimes it does my head in. I think it\u2019s that same troubling situation as you can feel with Picasso, or Jack Kerouac, being on the road and leaving women on the journey. It\u2019s a really hard thing because it\u2019s that meeting of an artist with their personality.</p> <h2>Elizabeth Peyton, painter: \u2018Like David Bowie, he defies any kind of label\u2019</h2> <p>It really wasn\u2019t easy for me to like his music. Kind of like smoking, it doesn\u2019t taste so great at first. But then during a tough time he suddenly made so much sense to me and, I\u2019m sure like many other people can say, he really helped me. I think Todd Haynes said something like Bob Dylan is there when you need him. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"bd8dcfdb26ac229675a17cf2cc453cd42c312fbf\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bd8dcfdb26ac229675a17cf2cc453cd42c312fbf/26_102_2013_2012/1000.jpg\" alt=\"elizabeth peyton\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>When I had the eureka Dylan moment it was because he symbolised someone who was just trying to be honest in his work and let that take him, move him, transform him. His integrity as an artist is very inspiring. I admire anyone who tries to make art directly about a topical situation, to transform it into something poetic. I started drawing him around 2007 and made some still lives. I made an artist book using my pictures of him.</p> <p>I think him winning this prize makes a lot of sense. It doesn\u2019t seem strange to me that a song writer has received the Nobel prize for literature. People have been wandering the earth with string instruments and songs for a few thousand years \u2013 it\u2019s a perfect, compact, way to contain art: feeling, time, history. I would have thought in 2016 we would be a bit beyond finding this strange, but perhaps Donald Trump is bringing all Americans down in the eyes of the world. Anyway, like David Bowie, Bob Dylan defies any kind of label.<br></p> <h2>Carol Morley, film-maker: \u2018I was influenced by Dylan without even realising\u2019</h2> <p>When I was an eight-year-old, I found a scrap of paper in my older brother\u2019s room, with words neatly written on it: \u201cIt\u2019s life and life only.\u201d These words seemed dramatic and intense and puzzling. I spent a long time thinking about them and they remained with me for years. A few years ago I told a friend about the impact they\u2019d had on me, and she smiled knowingly and told me that they came from a Bob Dylan song \u2013 <a href=\"http://bobdylan.com/songs/its-alright-ma-im-only-bleeding/\">It\u2019s Alright Ma, (I\u2019m only Bleeding)</a>. I was surprised but happy that I\u2019d been influenced by Dylan, without even realising. I even integrated those words into my 1960\u2019s set film <em>The Falling</em>, with Maisie Williams\u2019s defiant character saying in response to her best friend thinking she may be pregnant: \u201cIt\u2019s life and life only.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"2d06463244617979bf3a1895e87f010d8f154fc9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2d06463244617979bf3a1895e87f010d8f154fc9/960_0_3840_3840/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Film Maker Carol Morley\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>I think it\u2019s great that a lyricist has won for literature, as lyricists make such a brilliant and important contribution to most of our lives. Though I have to admit to often mishearing songs and making the words my own. It was not until fairly recently I found out that what I heard as, \u201cLay across my big brass band\u201d \u2013 and thought of as some kind of euphemism for male genitals \u2013 was in fact, \u201cLay across my big brass bed.\u201d</p> <p>When I think about Bob Dylan I immediately think of Cate Blanchett, who did a magnificent portrayal of him in Todd Haynes\u2019s <em>I\u2019m Not There</em>. In my fantasy counterculture world, it would be wonderful if Cate went and collected the Nobel prize on Bob Dylan\u2019s behalf. That there are no women included in this year\u2019s prizes, and that statistically since the origin of the award there is a lack of acknowledgment for those that aren\u2019t white men, doesn\u2019t surprise me. As Dylan said: \u201cThe masters make the rules.\u201d</p> <h2>Vashti Bunyan, singer-songwriter: \u2018How could he have found so many words?\u2019</h2> <p>Dylan totally deserves this. And it is quite brilliant that it has happened now, when we\u2019ve got four weeks to go [until the US election].</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"34861d2deb8b81ff18ee8f25e331bc2d01fda3a5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/34861d2deb8b81ff18ee8f25e331bc2d01fda3a5/2026_699_2629_2629/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Singer-songwriter Vashti Bunyan\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>I was never much one for poetry but for lyrics, completely. When I first heard Blowin\u2019 in the Wind it was [played by] a friend of mine at art school who played guitar and I asked him to teach me the chords for Blowin\u2019 in the Wind. This was in 1964 and he wouldn\u2019t because he thought that a girl shouldn\u2019t be singing a Bob Dylan song! But it was the rest of the <em>Freewheelin\u2019 Bob Dylan</em> album that really caught me and educated me. I was 19 and it probably gave me my first real thoughts about civil rights and about war. It was hugely important. It\u2019s very tempting to think that no music now could be as potent or affecting as those few years in the mid-60s. But then that\u2019s obviously because I lived through them.</p> <p>There\u2019s so much music to listen to now it\u2019s very hard to pick out something that is as clear as Bob Dylan\u2019s words were then. And such a massive amount of words. How could he have found so many words? The lyrics that have been going through my head today are from <a href=\"http://bobdylan.com/songs/oxford-town/\">Oxford Town</a>: \u201cOxford Town in the afternoon/ Everybody singing a sorrowful tune/ Two men died \u2019neath the Mississippi moon/ Somebody better investigate soon.\u201d Still now, that\u2019s so relevant: \u201csomebody better investigate soon\u201d.</p> <h2>Jessica Staveley-Taylor, musician, The Staves: \u2018He tells stories and you believe them straight away\u2019<br></h2> <p>Bob Dylan feels like something that has always been there \u2013 he\u2019s got a theory that the songs have already been written and he\u2019s just channelling that energy. <a href=\"http://bobdylan.com/songs/blowin-wind/\">Blowin\u2019 in the Wind</a> almost feels like a hymn, not a pop song written by a man who\u2019s still alive. When there are political events, people are still singing his old protest songs. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"db664262a57ff21bf47f5ecebe2d04a0d1f796a0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/db664262a57ff21bf47f5ecebe2d04a0d1f796a0/0_0_1380_1379/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The StavesJessica of the English Folk group, \u2018The Staves.\u2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>No one\u2019s really doing songs like that any more. As a guitar player some of the first songs I learned were his because he can write a song with just three chords. He\u2019s kind of the anti-folk musician in some ways: he\u2019s not a hugely proficient guitar player, some people would argue he can\u2019t sing \u2013 I don\u2019t agree, but he\u2019s obviously got a very distinctive vocal style.</p> <p>I\u2019ve heard some secondhand stories about Dylan from people who have worked with him and it sounds like he\u2019s quite tricky. You don\u2019t hear \u201cOh he\u2019s such a sweetheart\u201d, doing loads of charity work. I don\u2019t think anyone really knows him and I think that\u2019s deliberate: he created this character \u2013 maybe not in as extreme a way as someone like Bowie \u2013 but it ties in with how he takes on personas in his songwriting.</p> <p>There\u2019s this song of his, <a href=\"http://bobdylan.com/songs/i-was-young-when-i-left-home/\">I Was Young When I Left Home</a>, which is the story of a young man who left home and possibly comes from an autobiographical place, but it feels like an old song from 300 years ago or something. He does that so well: he tells stories and you believe them straight away.</p> <h2>And from the archive: Bob Dylan on tour, by Angela Carter, 1966</h2> <p>Performing, he\u2019s nothing but a shadow to look at, thin and black-clad and linear, a Beardsley hobgoblin. The little pointy face, so white it is almost blue in the spotlight, is shadowed by a baroque mound of curls. His gestures are harsh, angular and sketchy \u2013 insolent, asexual, frequently reminiscent of those of the Scarlet Hex Witch of the comic books. He seems at times to be sending up the overtly sexual writhings of the English pop stars of the new wave (ie Jagger).</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"cc4c10e85935e5a1bda8ce7836e59047bc4422ac\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cc4c10e85935e5a1bda8ce7836e59047bc4422ac/557_234_4748_4748/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Angela Carter. Circa 1981\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Bang, bang, drums, organ, amplified guitar. He does a black and white devil dance clutching a black and white amplified guitar and you can hardly hear a word he\u2019s singing. Maybe this is part of the plot. But it\u2019s all right, ma, he\u2019s only howling. Thus Bob Dylan, erstwhile Wonder Kid of Protest, demonstrated to packed and baffled theatres up and down the British Isles that he is approaching an artistic maturity of a most unexpected kind. Once, he was embraced by innocent liberals as a folk singer whose songs (The Times They Are a-Changing, Masters of War, The Lonesome Death of Hattie Carroll) pointed committed youth\u2019s way to an understanding of the 20th-century predicament. And this predicament might be solved just by singing them. It was a comfort. People like comforts. But maybe comfort doesn\u2019t finally help all that much.</p> <p>Dylan is no longer comfortable. The fat-cheeked, Huck Finn-capped youth of the early records who dealt in idealism and excruciating do-it-yourself romantic imagery (white doves, mountains, seas, rainbows \u2013 and, for God\u2019s sake, clowns) has grown up into the first ever all-electronic, all existential rock\u2019n\u2019roll singer. He\u2019s singing for Kafka, Kierkegaard, Dostoevsky and all the boys down home on Desolation Row.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9cb0ea877b2645a729e1e95ac0649f1acd9624c4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9cb0ea877b2645a729e1e95ac0649f1acd9624c4/0_158_3000_1869/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Bob Dylan on his 1966 tour of Britain.

He never hits a note true. He chews vowels like ju-jubes. He cries like a wolf (or like Howlin\u2019 Wolf). But what matters most is the songs. Which now have a tough urgency, a strained sense of critical involvement with 20th-century America and a kind of moral satire that is akin to Dean Swift and William Burroughs. Certainly, he\u2019s still got a long way to go on a peculiarly harsh and unrewarding path; but his beginnings are spectacular. The best of the songs on his latest all-electric LP, <em>Highway 61 Revisited</em>, songs such as Like a Rolling Stone and Ballad of a Thin Man, have a mature savagery and a scary kind of wit that is new and extraordinary in music of mass appeal.</p> <p>He has become a prophet of chaos and those who once accepted him as a blue-denim Messiah of a Brotherhood future once the times had changed may sense a personal betrayal. If not, then not. He attempted to pacify the old fans by doing the first half of his concerts in this country with acoustic guitar and mouth organ. As a matter of fact, Desolation Row sounds pretty silly without a beat backing and he seemed curiously apathetic and a bit lonely, all by himself on stage.</p> <p>At Cardiff, the audience greeted the opening lines of Mr Tambourine Man with relieved recognition and a round of applause; he did not even give a thin smile in return but threw the song away as if he wished he could throw his harmonica after it. No introductions, no nothing. He scrambled through the troubadour of song bit.</p> <p>He began to jerk into life when the group came on in the second half and the noise bit began. This Dylan is clanging and vulgar, neon and plastic and, at the same time, blackly, bleakly romantic. And exhilarating, akin to reading <em>The Dunciad</em> or a strip cartoon version of <em>Wuthering Heights </em>while riding a roller coaster.</p> <p>Dylan is a phenomenon. He never used to be. The smug outrage of the \u201cI hate <em>Time</em> magazine\u201d attitudes of his early songs was easy and shallow, but there are no easy answers, no easy imagery. He\u2019s on his own (like a rolling stone or like a Rolling Stone) and what happens now should be best of all. \u2014 <em>London Magazine, 1966</em></p> <p><em>This article was amended on 17 October 2016 to correct an error by which Vashti Bunyan\u2019s response had been attributed to someone else.</em></p>",

Carri\u00f3n, also a lecturer at Barcelona\u2019s University of Pompeu Fabra, knows all about the pleasures of discovering volumes in far-flung places, from Charing Cross Road to the boulevards of Buenos Aires.</p> <p>Among its many cultural attractions, Barcelona\u2019s unique and varied bookshops don\u2019t feature heavily on many visitors\u2019 hit lists. Yet they should. There are around 50 spread across the city.</p> <p>We start by heading west, along the Gran Via de les Corts Catalanes \u2013 the longest street in Catalonia. The ones we see have English titles peppering their Catalan and Spanish selections. There are two dedicated English language bookstores which cater to the city\u2019s expat set, although Carri\u00f3n insists that the real treasures are to be found elsewhere.</p> <p>Our starting point on Carrer de Bail\u00e8n is <a href=\"http://www.gigamesh.com/libreria\">Gigamesh</a>, a Mecca for sci-fi fans, and Carri\u00f3n\u2019s childhood haunt. Coming to the city from his hometown of Matar\u00f3, he was spoilt for choice. \u201cThere were eight bookshops of comics, role games and fantastic science fiction,\u201d he says. \u201cIt was a ritual to go on a Saturday morning.\u201d Gigamesh is also a successful publisher; in 2002, it bought the Spanish rights to the <em>Game of Thrones</em> saga.</p> <p>Around the corner, on the Gran Via, the boutique publisher Jan Mart\u00ed has recently opened Blackie Books\u2019 Lino. There you can find copies of books by Mark Twain alongside <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/childrens-books-site/2016/jan/12/charles-perraud-google-doodle-fairy-tales\">George Perrault\u2019s fairytales</a>, housed in the concierge booth of <a href=\"http://casabonay.com/shop/blackie-books/\">La Casa Bonay hotel</a>.

Further along Gran Via, the travel bookshop, <a href=\"http://www.altair.es/es/index.php\">Alta\u00efr</a>, matches regional guides to novels set in the area, a format familiar to customers of <a href=\"http://www.dauntbooks.co.uk/\">Daunt Books</a> in London.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Barcelona has become saturated by tourists in search of paella and sangria</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>As we bypass Pla\u00e7a Catalunya and the busy Barri Gotic, Carri\u00f3n explains how Barcelona has become saturated by tourism, a situation exacerbated by the cruise ships with their daytrippers in search of paella and sangria.</p> <p>Avoiding the throngs, we head instead to an imposing modernist mansion near the Jardins de la Reina Vict\u00f2ria. A creaky cage lift takes us up to the second floor and the elegant Librer\u00eda Anticuaria Comellas, Carri\u00f3n\u2019s \u201csecret bookshop\u201d. The selection of rare books, ranging from typography to gastronomy, is impressive and I\u2019m particularly taken by a collection of gruesome volumes on ophthalmology, though less so by the eyewatering \u20ac250,000 price tag.</p> <p>Returning to the heat and traffic, we turn down Carrer de les Ramelleres, past the ramshackle apartment once owned by the Chilean novelist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/roberto-bolano\">Roberto Bola\u00f1o</a>, to <a href=\"https://www.lacentral.com/\">La Central</a> \u2013 \u201cthe best bookshop in Barcelona\u201d, says Carri\u00f3n. It used to be a maternity hospital and still has a hatch in the wall where abandoned babies were left for the orphanage. The feel is monastic with its vaulted ceilings and wooden floors. Its designer, Miguel Sal, created a similar sense of calm and space in Waterstones, Piccadilly, in London.</p> <p>We continue through the Pla\u00e7a dels Angels and around the vast goldfish bowl windows of the <a href=\"http://www.macba.cat/en/\">Museu d\u2019Art Contemporani de Barcelona</a> to the <a href=\"http://www.cccb.org/en\">CCCB cultural centre bookshop</a>, well stocked with the great intellectuals of the region, such as the medieval Majorcan philosopher <a href=\"http://quisestlullus.narpan.net/eng/1_intro_eng.html\">Ramon Llull</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4d1e0c750ec606ab6e0934e6a8693707b5929de8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4d1e0c750ec606ab6e0934e6a8693707b5929de8/0_159_4526_2715/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Llibreria Calders, in Sant Antoni, is in a disused button factory.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Llibreria Calders, in Sant Antoni, is in a disused button factory.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Josep Lago/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Next is lunch at a caf\u00e9 in the 18th-century cloisters close by, a setting that could have come from the pages of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2012/jun/18/carlos-ruiz-zafon-live-webchat\">Carlos Ruiz Zaf\u00f3n</a>\u2019s <em>The Shadow of the Wind</em>.

This popular bookshop opened at the height of Spain\u2019s financial crisis, in a disused button factory just off Carrer del Parlament, which Carri\u00f3n says is \u201cthe most hipster street in Barcelona\u201d.</p> <p>It has a piano bar and a hectic programme of concerts and readings, where customers spill outside to drink under the plane trees. There\u2019s also enough poetry, literary fiction and graphic novels to satisfy any contemporary bibliophile.</p> <p>Although, notes Carri\u00f3n, even the most enthusiastic bookworm needs to take stock occasionally. He has recently moved to a new apartment with his wife and children. \u201cI had to give 1,000 books to a friend,\u201d he says. \u201cIf you\u2019ve got more than 5,000 books, you\u2019ve lost control.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Like Shia LaBeouf\u2019s door-to-door salesman Jake, who prides himself on becoming whatever his customers desire, Andrea Arnold\u2019s fourth feature as writer-director is whatever you want it to be. For some, this story of a teenage Texas girl finding her feet among a travelling group of magazine sellers will be a timeless coming-of-age tale, a young woman\u2019s search for a room (or trailer) of her own. To others, it\u2019ll be a modern-day <em>Easy Rider</em>, a post-Larry Clark/Gus van Sant youthsploitation adventure in which \u201cwe explore America, we party \u2013 it\u2019s cool\u201d. Detractors may see little more than an overlong pop-video indulgence in which on-the-road outsiders sing along to a celluloid jukebox soundtrack. For me, however, this is Arnold\u2019s best work since her 2006 feature debut <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2006/oct/29/philipfrench\" title=\"\"><em>Red Road</em></a>, an electrifying odyssey which mixes the <em>v\u00e9rit\u00e9 </em>grit of Ken Loach\u2019s sociopolitical parables with the awestruck natural beauty of Terrence Malick\u2019s rural cinematic dreams, all filtered through the eyes of an irrepressible heroine whose experiences are at once singular yet universal.</p> <p>We first meet 18-year-old Star (a revelatory performance from screen newcomer Sasha Lane) scavenging for food in a bin while caring for two young kids. Sick of the predatory gropings of a drunken \u201cDaddy\u201d, Star leaves her charges with a recalcitrant mother and runs for the minibus that promises to take her away on $300 a day. The only conditions are that she will work hard and that no one will miss her. Dazzled by the piratical, rat-tailed Jake (LaBeouf\u2019s most convincing performance since 2006\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2007/mar/02/drama.robertdowneyjr\" title=\"\"><em>A Guide to Recognizing Your Saints</em></a>), Star learns the tricks of the trade \u2013 the door-knocking deceptions, which at first appal her but gradually start to appeal. \u201cSo you\u2019re a southern girl,\u201d says steely crew-manager Krystal (Riley Keough, channelling her grandfather Elvis Presley\u2019s moody stare), \u201ca real American Honey like me.\u201d But with Jake the object of both their attentions, relations will never be sweet between Star and the girl in the Confederate flag bikini.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/oct/09/andrea-arnold-interview-american-honey-shia-labeouf-sasha-lane\">Andrea Arnold: \u2018I always aim to get under the belly of a place\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Partly inspired by a 2007 <em>New York Times </em>article about the brutal on-the-road existence of \u201cmag crew\u201d kids, <em>American Honey </em>revisits many of the themes that have haunted Arnold\u2019s work since the days of her Oscar-winning 2003 short <em>Wasp</em> \u2013 social inequality, dangerous attractions, defiant spirits. Yet with its dappled sunlight and crystalline lens flare, Arnold\u2019s first film set outside the UK also mixes in elements of what she calls the \u201cmythical America of westerns and road movies\u201d. Whether it\u2019s the wind blowing through Star\u2019s hair as the minibus hits the highway, or bodies intertwined in the grass as salesmanship is briefly abandoned in favour of sex, there is epic intimacy amid the harsh poetry. Cinematographer Robbie Ryan shoots in the squarer Academy ratio, which has been Arnold\u2019s signature since <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2009/sep/13/fish-tank-andrea-arnold-french\" title=\"\"><em>Fish Tank</em></a>, but his superb use of the 4x3 frame makes the image seem taller, rather than narrower, than more popular widescreen formats. There\u2019s a lot of sky in <em>American Honey</em>, a sense of expansiveness that marries shallow-focus closeups of pierced and tattooed skin with breathtaking vistas that seem to sweep upward towards the stars.</p> <p>Somehow, this frame creates a safe environment for the cast, many of whom are first-timers picked from shopping malls and skate parks. Lane herself was on a beach-bound spring break in Florida when she caught Arnold\u2019s eye. There\u2019s something of Katie Jarvis\u2019s Mia from <em>Fish Tank</em> about Star, a streetwise facade masking an empathetic soul. In an unforgiving world she is a nurturing presence, constantly saving the omnipresent insects that fall into water and fly into windows, struggling to protect the firefly spirits that thrum throughout the drama. And while Star may climb with reckless abandon into passing cars and trucks (from an open-top full of good ol\u2019 boys to a cattle truck en route to an abattoir), we never doubt her shimmering indestructibility. Jake may have got a gun, but it\u2019s Star who knows how to handle one.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y1SpWZm1PLc\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/y1SpWZm1PLc?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y1SpWZm1PLc\">Watch a trailer for American Honey.</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>As thumping hip-hop blares from the bus, <em>American Honey </em>reveals its true roots in the dreamy fantasias of the musical.

Later, the call-and-response of E-40\u2019s Choices (Yup) soundtracks a bonding car-park ritual, while a singalong to the Lady Antebellum song from which <em>American Honey</em> takes its title echoes the glorious Tiny Dancer sequence from Cameron Crowe\u2019s <em>Almost Famous</em>. Some may see this journey as bleak, but it\u2019s <em>The Wizard of Oz</em> and <em>Star Wars</em> that (g)litter these kids\u2019 dreams, placing a yellow brick road beneath their feet, a distant Death Star above their heads, and a tough but tender sweetness in their hearts.</p>",

But then Hill points out that this was part of a bizarre IRL food show where the two cooks pretended to live together, pepping up recipes with laddish jokes about letting off wind (\u201cYou were pungent last night, weren\u2019t you?\u201d, quips Young Paul). It\u2019s followed by a truly strange montage of Martin shooting inexplicably lingering glances at Hollywood. At one point, his eyes dart southwards as Hollywood bends over in front of a hot oven. By the end of it, Hollywood looks mortified enough to explode and shower the set with chunks of mahogany-hued bread aficionado. Sweet, delicious schadenfreude: we\u2019d give it a 10 for tastiness.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-4gmgZ1vivg\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/-4gmgZ1vivg?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>The remainder of Harry Hill\u2019s Tea-Time proves to be a peculiar cocktail of odd games, deliberately useless recipes and ropey celebrity impersonations. At points it makes almost no sense at all, and yet it\u2019s so good to see the big-collared oaf back on TV, goofing his way through fumbled recipes like a benign Gregg Wallace. Supposedly the point to this show is that it\u2019s a take on our obsession with turning food prep into light entertainment, but that\u2019s not really its brilliance. The real joy in Harry Hill\u2019s Tea-Time is the sheer stupidity.</p> <p>Why are we watching a Quasimodo lookalike playing a game where he deep-fat fries a mystery item? Why is there a woman dressed as the Archbishop of Athens, Ieronymos II, having a fist-fight over a plate of Ferrero Rocher? Why does the show end with a troupe of Delia Smith lookalikes singing This Charming Man while extras throw custard pies and yell \u201cGive us back the Elgin Marbles\u201d? No idea. None at all. Like its ITV predecessor, this is another giddy romp through Hill\u2019s singular mind that leaves you chuckling because it\u2019s all so gloriously pointless. It allows you to drift off into an escapist fantasy land, the perfect panacea for panic-inducing news stories. And if it leaves Paul Hollywood looking shamefaced, then that\u2019s all the better.</p>",

The book was a huge hit \u2013 spending 76 weeks at the top of the UK bestseller list. Treadaway plays James, a role that presented several new challenges for the actor. \u201cOften if you\u2019re playing a real person, they\u2019ve been dead 50 years,\u201d he says. \u201cNot only was this about a real person and a real cat, but they were both there on set.\u201d The first day\u2019s filming for which James was present required Treadaway to re-enact his agonies in hospital after a heroin overdose. \u201cAs an actor you just hope you\u2019ve done your homework and can do it justice.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3068d19ef13e08c91c0e083ed516e1d04ccd716d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3068d19ef13e08c91c0e083ed516e1d04ccd716d/374_177_1806_1083/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Working with animals: Treadaway with Bob in A Street Cat Named Bob.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Working with animals: Treadaway with Bob in A Street Cat Named Bob.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/Sony Pictures Releasing</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The second challenge was working with the cat.

  "<p>No film this year sounded worse on paper than <strong>The Angry Birds Movie</strong> (Sony, U): the mobile game, an irritation-based fad already past its pop-culture peak, has no obvious narrative framework, and kamikaze canaries are surely more fun when you\u2019re the one controlling them. Against all conceivable odds, however, Clay Kaytis and Fergal Reilly\u2019s suitably crazed, Crayola-splattered cartoon is a pleasure: a disposable one, low on nutrition and high on noise, but a romp that adds just enough character-based warmth to the game\u2019s dumb, knockabout anarchy to justify the leap to a screen larger than six inches. I\u2019ll be surprised anew if the <a href=\"http://deadline.com/2016/10/james-corden-ilana-glazer-emojimovie-cast-sony-animation-1201833926/\">forthcoming Emoji movie</a> has anything like its spirit.</p> <p>More chiaroscuro-toned thrills are on offer in <strong>The Clan</strong> (Curzon Artificial Eye, 15), Argentinian director Pablo Trapero\u2019s muscular, muskily atmospheric underworld drama, based on the true story of the Puccio family and their profitable, government-enabled kidnapping schemes. It\u2019s a riveting, luridly horrifying tale with nary a sympathetic face in sight, treated with oak-smoked solemnity by Trapero, whose brooding direction borrows liberally from the Scorsese playbook. It\u2019s a film with one eye on Hollywood, yet the facts and political context of the case lend it bitter distinction.</p> <p>It\u2019s been too long since Susan Sarandon\u2019s peppery charms were given as sympathetic a vehicle as <strong>The Meddler</strong> (Sony, 12), a light, humane mother-daughter comedy that is at once as soft and as sensibly solid as a woollen blanket. Sarandon stars as a recent widow who, after being ordered out of the affairs of her workaholic daughter (Rose Byrne), turns her slightly invasive generosity to the world around her. You could carp about the more sitcom-shaped constructs of Lorene Scafaria\u2019s film, but that\u2019s not to deny the honest compassion of its writing and performances. Comfort food of a beefier variety is on offer in <strong>The Take </strong>(StudioCanal, 15) \u2013 released in cinemas as <em>Bastille Day</em>, but understandably retitled after this year\u2019s 14 July tragedy \u2013 in which Idris Elba, as a rule-busting CIA agent chasing down terrorists in Paris, continues to hone his James Bond audition.

Iridescently shot (by the great Declan Quinn) in 2015 at Las Vegas\u2019s MGM Grand, the film showcases Timberlake, in all his glassy-voiced glory, as a master showman, but also as a product of a vast, stunningly assembled pop machine.</p>",

  "<p>In 1997 the young architectural practice <a href=\"http://www.haworthtompkins.com/\">Haworth Tompkins</a> was commissioned to redesign the Royal Court theatre in London.

Their work has been as influential as that of any artistic director. Co-founder Steve Tompkins speaks on behalf of a cooperative organisation.</p> <p><strong>Your background was in social housing. Why on earth did you take on theatres?<br></strong>Theatre architecture is not just about performance. It\u2019s about how you frame civil society. Where are the spaces in which strangers can meet at peace in a city? That for us is the underpinning idea. If you look at the support space of the theatre as a commercial space like a shopping mall or a branded coffee bar something has gone terribly wrong. You predispose the audience to being in a mood of consumerism rather than human transaction.</p> <p><strong>What makes an ideal theatre building?<br></strong>It has to be able to respond to the mood of the performance. If you\u2019ve got a gaiety space and you\u2019re putting on Beckett you\u2019re in trouble. If you have a sombre black box and you\u2019re trying to do a comedy it\u2019s deadly. That applies not just to the auditorium but to the facade. A theatre should behave like a good host. It needs to have eyes in the back of its head, to pull people in and diminish divisions. These should be spaces where you feel at home at any time of the day.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2015/apr/05/national-theatre-makeover-haworth-tompkins-review-decluttered-beautiful\">National Theatre makeover: big round of applause for Haworth Tompkins</a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong>What\u2019s the most important factor?<br></strong>Lighting is crucial.

The more members that have a say, the harder it is to manipulate or branch stack the system \u2013 this is where the shift occurs from patronage to merit.\u201d</p> <p>The convention also heard from Victorian Liberal state executive member Marcus Bastiaan, who wrote in the <a href=\"http://spectator.com.au/2016/10/october-revolution-time-for-democracy-in-the-nsw-liberals/\">Spectator on Saturday</a> that since the state instituted the reforms in 2008, party membership was flourishing. </p> <p>At the recent federal election, the Liberal party won their only Labor gain in Victoria while Bastiaan said the NSW division \u201csuffered the party\u2019s worst result \u2013 a seven-seat electoral wipeout\u201d.</p> <p>Bastiaan likened the involvement of lobbyists in the NSW party to the recent donation scandal that forced Labor senator Sam Dastyari to resign from the frontbench.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/oct/14/factional-fanfare-on-the-boil-again-within-labor-and-liberal-parties\">Factional fanfare rears its head again within Labor and Liberal parties | Katharine Murphy</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cWhether Dastyari\u2019s actions were explicitly legal or not is secondary to the perception of wrongdoing,\u201d Bastiaan wrote. </p> <p>\u201cThe mere perception was sufficient cause for the public to lose faith and trust in Dastyari. In an era where a corporate brand matters almost as much shareholder returns, companies found to be employing lobbyists involved in the blatant manipulation of major political parties may well receive a similar fate to Dastyari.</p> <p>\u201cNSW leadership figures have an opportunity to draw a line in the sand and embrace a reform agenda as Victoria and other states have done.

  "<p>David Cameron is gone, and his \u201cno ifs, no buts\u201d rejection of a third runway at Heathrow is not binding on his successor. Boris Johnson, no longer mayor of London and told to be on best behaviour at the Foreign Office, has gone conspicuously quiet on Heathrow, where he once he threatened to lie down in front of bulldozers. Now no one even expects him to resign from the cabinet if the airport expansion gets a green light.</p> <p>We\u2019ll learn the truth as soon as next week but the rumour mill sounds correct. Theresa May will say yes to a third runway and will spout some banalities, straight from the airport\u2019s PR handbook, about how only Heathrow can deliver those connections to deepest China, India and Latin America that the UK will need to prosper in a post-Brexit world. Thus she will buy a short period of peace from the Heathrow-loving business lobby that is currently hopping mad about everything from \u201chard\u201d Brexit to workers on boards.</p> <p>It will be the wrong decision. Gatwick is the better choice on four grounds: cost, certainty, competition and pollution.</p> <p>On cost, the Airports Commission priced a third runway at Heathrow at \u00a317.6bn, versus \u00a37.1bn for a second runway at Gatwick. The money would be raised privately, of course, but the bill will ultimately fall on customers in the form of higher landing charges.</p> <p>But the cost estimate has to be taken with a pinch of salt when you consider the second factor. The only guaranteed arrival following approval for a third runway is that of a swarm of lawyers. The public inquiries and judicial reviews would last for years. By contrast, work on expanding Gatwick could start by the end of the decade, and with less fuss.</p> <p>The competition angle is crucial. The old BAA was privatised by the Thatcher government with a monopoly over London airports \u2013 Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted. That structure is now seen as utterly mad. Smashing that monopoly in 2009, on the orders of the Competition Commission, encouraged competition, fuelled investment in Heathrow and Gatwick under separate owners, and made the flying experience less unpleasant. A third runway at Heathrow would make it harder for Gatwick to compete in the long-haul market; some of its short-haul traffic could even head to the larger airport.</p> <p>On pollution, relatively rural Gatwick is plainly the better choice: there are fewer homes there. At the time the commission was writing, the area around Heathrow was already breaching European regulations on nitrogen dioxide pollution.</p> <p>Sir Howard Davies\u2019s panel nevertheless preferred a third runway at Heathrow because its established status as a hub makes it better-placed to deliver more routes to more places. The benefits, it said, are \u201csignificantly greater, for business passengers, freight operators and the broader economy.\u201d That is almost certainly true in a world of theoretical economical modelling. In the real world, Gatwick is simply more likely to happen.</p> <p>If May wanted to attempt to square the circle, an alternative suggestion has been gaining popularity in some quarters: approve a second runway at Gatwick but give Heathrow permission to proceed with the first stage of the lower-cost idea of extending the existing northern runway.</p> <p>This is the \u201cHeathrow Hub\u201d proposal and one of its advantages is that extra capacity could be phased in: the extended runway could handle 70,000 additional aircraft movements a year while still using existing terminals. Expansion beyond that would require more infrastructure, but could be left for another day.</p> <p>The cost of phase one would also be relatively low \u2013 less than \u00a34bn, say the backers. Some of the same legal complexities would apply, but at least Gatwick would be happening and competition between the airports would be preserved. A joint Gatwick/Heathrow Hub ticket would be a fudge, or course. But solving this interminable problem question of airport capacity has always involved imperfect compromises.</p> <h2>William Hill merger deal leaves no one holding an ace</h2> <p>Less than a week after it was unveiled to surprised shareholders, William Hill\u2019s proposed \u00a36bn merger with Canadian-listed Amaya looks dead in the water.</p> <p>The bookmaker\u2019s biggest investor, Parvus Asset Management, holding a 14% stake, is fiercely and loudly opposed. Former chief executive Ralph Topping, who is still revered at William Hill as the man who outpaced Ladbrokes by several furlongs, also can\u2019t see the logic. \u201cWhen this deal was announced I was left scratching my head,\u201d Topping <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5ad62772-91fc-11e6-a72e-b428cb934b78\" title=\"\">told the <em>FT</em></a>. \u201cI\u2019m very anxious on the future of William Hill.\u201d</p> <p>The sceptics are right. Amaya is an online poker company carrying a pile of debt. While, in theory, some of the players on its PokerStars website might be persuaded to have a flutter on William Hill\u2019s online sports offering, any precise projection is guesswork.</p> <p>What is certain is that the combined group\u2019s borrowings would rise well beyond levels William Hill has previously deemed prudent. There is also the small matter of Amaya\u2019s $870m (\u00a3713m) penalty for alleged breaches of Kentucky gambling law. The fine will probably end up being reduced, but by how much?</p> <p>Gareth Davis, William Hill\u2019s chairman, is an old hand whose touch is normally assured. He\u2019s seen more than a few deals over the years and will know that zero-premium \u201cmergers of equals\u201d, which is how this one is being advertised, require the advantages for both sides to be obvious on day one. The Amaya deal has failed to generate the required fizz of excitement.</p> <p>At the moment, it is merely a proposal, and Davis and co could claim they are required to give all proposals an exploratory poke. True enough, but investors also expect directors not to dawdle when resistance is so strong.</p> <p>In a gambling industry consolidating at speed, there is a fair argument that William Hill should combine with somebody. Just not Amaya. Davis and his interim chief executive, Philip Bowcock, should know that half the skill of poker is knowing when to fold a weak hand. That time is now.</p> <h2>Samsung must raise its game</h2> <p>Among the rifles and submachine guns in the weapons store, a Samsung Galaxy Note 7 glows threateningly inside its display case.

At that price, customers rightly expect a brand that puts consumer safety first.</p> <p>Samsung took more than a month to scrap its botched product but it will take it far longer to recover from the reputational hit.</p>",
  "<h2>St Thomas \u00e0 Becket, Fairfield, Kent<br></h2> <p>In a flat, lonely corner of Romney Marsh, this church is blessed with an atmospheric beauty that is only enhanced by its desolate surroundings. The steeply pitched red-tiled roof of the nave, topped by a bell-cote that resembles a castle turret, marks the building out from the common stock. If it looks familiar it may be because it featured in the recent television and cinema adaptations of Dickens\u2019 Great Expectations. The church today is the result of many piecemeal building efforts but, overall, it is how it would have looked in the 18th century. By rights, it shouldn\u2019t be here at all. Fairfield has always had an atomised population and so its church was built with the idea that it might not be needed for very long. Thus a small lath-and-plaster structure was first thrown up on this spot at some time around 1200.</p> <h2><br></h2> <h2>The Italian Chapel, Orkney<br></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"82e2c741516055bedbae53b90945a69385285a49\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/82e2c741516055bedbae53b90945a69385285a49/0_97_3008_1806/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Italian chapel, Orkney, Scotland.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\"></span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In January 1942, the small, northerly isle of Lamb Holm became home to some of the 1,200 Italian soldiers brought to Orkney. Although the prisoners built themselves a theatre and a recreation hut, they lacked a chapel. After some gentle cajoling, the camp padre with the artist, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/aug/18/in-praise-of-domenico-chiocchetti-orkney\">Domenico Chiocchetti</a>, got the prisoners permission to erect a chapel from two Nissen huts, joined end to end. Visit the chapel today and you\u2019ll see what an extraordinary job the Italian soldiers did \u2013 they plasterboarded the huts, fashioned an altar out of concrete and installed windows filled with painted glass. Chioccetti himself painted the sanctuary and his Madonna and Child altarpiece is the chapel\u2019s crowning glory. In 1960, the BBC paid for him to freshen up his masterpiece. He returned four years later, this time bearing a gift of 14 stations of the cross, which can still be seen in the chapel.</p> <h2>St Swithun-upon-Kingsgate, Winchester, Hampshire<br></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3fad1de18313b8074c034e31064faa8272d73de5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3fad1de18313b8074c034e31064faa8272d73de5/0_149_2592_3240/800.jpg\" alt=\"Wooden stairwell to St Swithun-Upon-Kingsgate, Winchester\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\"></span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dixe Wills</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Tucked away in a side street, this one-roomed Medieval gate church is often overlooked by visitors. It\u2019s place of surprising quietude in the heart of throbbing Winchester and has provided a place of sanctuary for over 750 years. The first record of it is in a 1264 report detailing its burning down by angry citizens during a dispute with the local priory. It was rebuilt as a parish church in 1539, when the monastery at Winchester was dissolved by Henry VIII. Before climbing the covered staircase up to the church, have a look at the battlements on the walls \u2013 though a holy building, this was still part of a defensive structure. Being on top of a city gate is quite special but being one of the very rare surviving medieval city gate churches adds lustre to the experience.</p> <h2>St Fursey\u2019s, Sutton, Norfolk<br></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cf73db1d12e1fd27bb8824f674afa87880adcd32\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cf73db1d12e1fd27bb8824f674afa87880adcd32/0_269_3872_2323/1000.jpg\" alt=\"St Fursey\u2019s, Sutton, Norfolk\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\"></span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dixe Wills</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The smallest working church in England, and arguably the strangest, St Fursey\u2019s is a modern-day labour of love. It\u2019s built in the garden belonging to its priest, Father Stephen Weston. The story began in 1998 when Father Stephen, disillusioned with the Anglican Church in which he had served as a vicar for 20 years, left to join the Antiochan Orthodox church. There being no English-speaking Orthodox church in the district, he immediately set about constructing one out of plywood, measuring just 18ft x 13ft. Basing the design on an almost equally small 4th-century church at Silchester in Hampshire, with the help of volunteers he completed the building within six months at a cost of around \u00a35,000.</p> <h2>Odda\u2019s Chapel, Deerhurst, Gloucestershire<br></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c7fcd0d440ad30bda034723bf960935ac66d0ffc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c7fcd0d440ad30bda034723bf960935ac66d0ffc/0_0_3872_2592/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Odda\u2019s Chapel, Deerhurst\" width=\"1000\" height=\"669\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\"></span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dixe Wills</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Odda\u2019s Chapel would never have been identified as a Saxon place of worship had it not been for two things: the discovery of the ancient Odda Stone in 1675 near the parish church and local vicar the Rev George Butterworth\u2019s resolve to turn detective. A Latin inscription on the stone said the chapel was built and dedicated by Earl Odda for his brother, Aelfric, in 1056 but it couldn\u2019t be referring to the existing parish church, which is a much earlier building. In 1885, when repairs were done to a local house, the vicar discovered an altar stone which confirmed he\u2019d found the site of the chapel. As far as is known, it has only ever been part of a home and now consists of a nave and chancel divided by an arch, with a doorway in the north wall and minimal furnishings.</p> <h2>St Cuthbert\u2019s Chapel, Inner Farne, Northumberland<br></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"74331de504f691374290e15f0d493e27da5128bc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/74331de504f691374290e15f0d493e27da5128bc/0_192_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"St Cuthberts Chapel on Inner Farne, in the Farne Islands, Northumberland, UK\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\"></span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alany</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This little chapel stands on Inner Farne, the biggest island of the group, and is one of the few remaining physical links to the area\u2019s monastic past. Former shepherdboy and prior Cuthbert arrived in 676, spent a short spell as bishop of Holy Island, and returned to Inner Farne to die in 687. The 14th-century chapel, much restored in the 1800s, is dedicated to him. But this is a visit for twitchers \u2013 the island is teeming with birdlife, including puffins, guillemots, shags, cormorants, razorbills, eiders and Arctic terns, among numerous others. It\u2019s fitting, given all this avian activity, that when St Cuthbert lived here he laid down decrees protecting the island\u2019s birds. To this day, eiders are known in Northumberland as \u201ccuddy ducks\u201d (from \u201cCuthbert\u2019s ducks\u201d).</p> <h2>St Mary\u2019s, Lead, Yorkshire<br></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"af99e52b048d21631c8586f6bc113455775b12aa\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/af99e52b048d21631c8586f6bc113455775b12aa/0_174_3872_2324/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Old wooden door with inscriptions at St Mary\u2019s, Lead\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\"></span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dixe Wills</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Poor old St Mary\u2019s cuts a rather lonely figure, sitting in a boggy Yorkshire field. It wasn\u2019t ever thus. Built in the 14th century, this private chapel to a manor house was an opulent place twice its current size, with a gilded ceiling and a large chancel at the east end. Now it is is a plain rectangle with an empty stone bell-cote and no church yard but it\u2019s the floor that holds the church\u2019s greatest treasures. Some of the huge grave slabs, bearing heraldic symbols, are actually older than the building itself, going back to a time of knights and chivalrous deeds. But the church will always be associated with the Battle of Towton, the bloodiest battle of the War of the Roses, which took place on Palm Sunday 1461 and it is the only building on or around the battlefield that remains standing.</p> <h2>St Fillan\u2019s, Killin, Stirlingshire<br></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fb5fe6b8bc89f29e2100eeb7bd7644f821b49037\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fb5fe6b8bc89f29e2100eeb7bd7644f821b49037/0_221_3872_2324/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Altar at St Fillan\u2019s, Killin.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\"></span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dixe Wills</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The \u201ctin tabernacles\u201d were arbingers of the mass-produced, flat-packed world we inhabit today, and were once viewed as a godsend by Victorian vicars in rapidly expanding industrial areas whose churches were full to bursting. Only around 60 of the myriad erected in Scotland have made still stand \u2013 this one was built in 1876 by the 7th Earl of Breadalbane as a chapel of ease for his shooting parties (its nickname is the \u201cGrouse Chapel\u201d), and it is the oldest and most beautifully preserved survivor. The metallic exterior of the church belies what is inside. Pine-clad walls give the place a Scandinavian air, and its numerous short wooden pews make it seem larger than it is. The altar is made of carved and painted wood and the ornate altar rail is from the demolished chapel at Taymouth Castle in Kenmore. The scene is completed by a circular stained-glass window above the altar.</p> <h2>St Govan\u2019s Chapel, Bosherston, Pembrokeshire<br></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c33e99d62219c924cc6f861b35b2f51e1369894c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c33e99d62219c924cc6f861b35b2f51e1369894c/0_779_4777_2865/1000.jpg\" alt=\"View from above St Govan's cliffside chapel, Pembrokeshire Wales\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\"></span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This little chapel is perched halfway down a Pembrokeshire cliff beside a holy well \u2013 and its extraordinary location, plus its very early and uncertain genesis, has made it a thing of folklore. There is a simple nave measuring about 17ft x 12ft, with an opening to a rough cell beyond. General consensus dates it to between the 11th and 13th centuries, with a 6th-century original chapel a possibility. Inside, it appears to be an empty shell of rough stones, green with mould. However, features emerge, including an opening for the spring on the floor, with a long bench, a piscina and a plain stone altar. Pass through the doorway in the west wall to explore the remainder of the elderly St Govan\u2019s domain. The well has run dry and so any curative qualities of its waters have been lost but, happily, the tranquillity found in this place is still balm for the soul.</p> <h2>St Trillo\u2019s Chapel (Capel Sant Trillo), Rhos-on-Sea, Conwy<br></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1231e70ec2383b650befec10bf8aba3c842411c1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1231e70ec2383b650befec10bf8aba3c842411c1/0_135_3872_2323/1000.jpg\" alt=\"St. Trillo\u2019s Chapel, Rhos-On-Sea, Wales.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\"></span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dixe Wills</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Tucked back from the promenade, this chapel measures just 8ft by 11ft inside and looks more like a stone shed. The first building to have stood on this spot was a cell constructed by the saint himself in the 6th century. He established his little enclosure around a well, which attracted the sick and the lame hoping for a miraculous cure. The stone-and-mortar chapel is mostly of 16th or 17th century origin but, by the 1890s, it was in a bit of state and was comprehensively restored. Inside, the low, whitewashed barrel-vaulted ceiling and rough stone floor lend the place the quality of a grotto, enhanced by little ceramic items and other offerings left by visitors. Other than that, there are about half a dozen chairs, a shelf/altar and there\u2019s sometimes a candle burning in front of the small wooden cross.</p> <p>\u2022 <em>Tiny Churches by Dixe Wills is published by <a href=\"http://shop.theaa.com/store/home/tiny_churches\">AA Publishing</a></em></p>",

What should have been the heartwarming end, as her parents get the news and all are reunited in hospital, is of course only the heartbreaking beginning.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fda89eadd838062a2c820a84b9c144f80ad71808\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fda89eadd838062a2c820a84b9c144f80ad71808/0_286_4284_2570/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tch\u00e9ky Karyo as Julien Baptiste in The Missing.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tch\u00e9ky Karyo as Julien Baptiste in The Missing.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: BBC</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The one constant is Tch\u00e9ky Karyo, as lovely French cop Julien Baptiste, now retired yet still haunted by the occasional failure.

Timewise, this slips and slides as much as the original between past and present: fortunately we have not only Julien\u2019s hair to chronologically guide us (from friendly shaggy mane to brutalist stubble) but also <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2016/mar/02/david-morrissey-interview-hangmen-the-ones-below\" title=\"\">David Morrissey</a> as Alison\u2019s army father, who somehow between her return and today has suffered savage burns to body and neck.

I know a couple of Grishams have filmed well, but that must have been accidental: after all, Hollywood even managed a 10th-way decent <em>Da Vinci Code</em>, inordinately more than the book ever deserved. In the sun-riddled environs of the San Fernando valley and Venice Beach, lawyer Billy Bob Thornton hides from the vitamin D in faintly grubby bars, all brown wood, brown memories and tatty fairylights; this is the California of tyre stores and nail parlours in much the same way as that woeful cheerless Christmas market is the reality of much of Lower Saxony.</p> <p>By common consent, he drinks too much (and always has the rejoinder: \u201cThat\u2019s not entirely accurate. I drink exactly the right amount for me\u201d). He is also, of course, a faded lawyer, bright as a pewter button just needing polishing, and persuaded here to go up against the Goliath of the firm he co-founded in pursuit of a wrongful death-at-sea claim. He doesn\u2019t yet know, but we do, or at least can take a punt at suspecting, that it\u2019ll be, oh, <em>so</em> much more conspiratorial than that.</p> <p>This is very moreish, not least because Billy Bob is actually channelling Philip Marlowe \u2013 same shiny/dirty US state, about 80 years later. \u201cListen lady, I\u2019m nervous already, and you\u2019re a yapper,\u201d is the kind of thing he will say, not unkindly, but with equally little regard for finesse. \u201cWhen in doubt, have a man come through the door with a gun in his hand,\u201d wrote Chandler: hasn\u2019t happened so far, but I\u2019ll bet the farm.

  "<p>Director Nick Bagnall and composer James Fortune take Shakespeare\u2019s early satirical romance (some say, his very first play) out of time and relocate it in 1966 (love letters transform to 45rpm vinyl discs). They bend it into a music-led event with eight actors playing 12 roles (13 if we count musician Fred Thomas doubling as a hound dog) and also a variety of instruments in an onstage band (drums, guitars, sax, keyboard etc).</p> <p>The plot explores a range of loves \u2013 not all of them groovy. Valentine loves Sylvia. Proteus loves Julia until he meets Sylvia, decides he can\u2019t live without her love and, unable to control himself, attempts to rape her. This violent act is the final test of the love between the two male friends. Their friendship survives strengthened, but at a cost to the two women, this production suggests. Romantic love is no substitute for this male bonding. Tied to the men, in a patriarchal world they cannot get away from, Julia and Sylvia face a future of sorrow with, as they wail in the concluding duet, \u201cloneliness wandering round my door\u201d. For these two women, youth\u2019s carnival is definitely over. The play\u2019s strongest instance of true love is that of Proteus\u2019s servant for his dog: Launce stands loyally by Crab, shouldering blame for his beast\u2019s wild thing behaviours (Charlotte Mills\u2019s Launce is a bright presence).</p> <p>Sadly, Bagnall\u2019s yoking of the 60s to Shakespeare turns out to be as mismatched as the couples at the end. His production is not thoughtful, playful or witty enough to resolve plentiful incongruities between 1960s and 1590s; the play is lost somewhere between the two. The acting is weak: mannerisms replace characterisations, while words are gabbled, shouted and lost. Music and dances disturb the rhythm of the action without providing compensatory good vibrations. If this were a 1960s record, it would be a <em>Juke Box Jury </em>\u201cMiss\u201d.</p> <ul> <li><a href=\"http://www.everymanplayhouse.com/whats-on/the-two-gentlemen-of-verona\">At the Everyman, Liverpool until 29 October</a><br></li> </ul>",
  "<p>Poor Ronald McDonald. Following the scary clown appearances that shocked people around the globe, the burger chain has decided to cut back on public appearances of its pasty-faced mascot.</p> <p>That is not the only bad news for McDonald\u2019s, which reports third-quarter figures on Friday. According to the <em>Wall Street Journal</em>, an internal memo shows that only one in five millennials has ever tried a Big Mac.</p> <p>No wonder the company is trying so hard to reinvent itself. It is now 18&#xa0;months into a transformation plan led by British-born chief executive Steve Easterbrook, which includes offering all-day breakfasts, improving the quality of the food on offer, and selling thousands of its restaurants to franchisees. Last week it said it would be making $130m of restructuring charges in this latest quarter and would increase the number of restaurants sold to franchisees from 3,500 to 4,000, out of a total of 36,000.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jul/26/mcdonalds-revenue-falls-second-quarter-2016\" title=\"\">In July, McDonald\u2019s reported a 4% fall in second-quarter revenues</a> amid growing consumer uncertainty.

Anything else could prove very scary for investors.</p> <h2>Bailey decision should check Burberry\u2019s slide</h2> <p>With Burberry planning to end its experiment with creative director Christopher Bailey also acting as chief executive, the luxury goods group could be back on the road to recovery.</p> <p>In the summer, the company announced that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jul/11/burberrys-christopher-bailey-new-ceo-celine-marco-gobbetti\" title=\"\">Bailey would move back to his creative role</a>, and that Marco Gobbetti, the man behind LVMH\u2019s C\u00e9line brand, would take over as chief executive some time in 2017. During his tenure Bailey was unfortunate to face a slowdown in demand for luxury goods, particularly in China and Hong Kong. But since the summer things have picked up, helped by the slump in the pound \u2013 which is boosting its overseas profits as well as tempting more tourists to visit London and snap up its trademark beige check.</p> <p>Recent positive comments from LVMH on trading in Hong Kong also bode well for Burberry, which releases its latest update on Tuesday. Despite the delay in Gobbetti starting, analysts at Berenberg said: \u201cThe recently revamped management team should provide the necessary talent and focus to steer it in the right direction. We believe that the second-quarter results [this week] could mark Burberry\u2019s return to positive like-for-like sales.\u201d</p> <h2>BHP gets the carrot and stick treatment</h2> <p>It\u2019s rare to see a company winning plaudits over its pay policy and then almost immediately being slapped down. But mining group BHP Billiton has achieved that distinction before its annual meeting on Thursday.</p> <p>Corporate governance advisor Pirc praised the company for not paying chief executive Andrew Mackenzie anything under its various incentive schemes last year, cutting his bonus to zero following the dam disaster at the Samarco mine in Brazil in 2015 and the decline in commodity markets that has undermined the whole sector.</p> <p>Pirc said: \u201cThis is a welcome use of the remuneration committee\u2019s discretion. Furthermore, the ratio of chief executive to average employee pay is considered acceptable.\u201d</p> <p>But before BHP could get too carried away, Pirc criticised plans to give Mackenzie up to 200% of his salary under further incentive schemes, \u201cwhich is considered excessive\u201d.</p> <p>It added: \u201cPerformance targets for short-term incentives are not disclosed,&#xa0;making it impossible for shareholders to judge if the targets are challenging.\u201d It said proposed long-term incentive plans were not \u201can effective means of incentivising performance \u2026 not properly long-term and are subject to manipulation due to their discretionary nature\u201d.</p>",
  "<p>Note and lament a new world record. On the latest count, there are now 126 journalists in Turkey\u2019s jails \u2013 more than China, Iran and Egypt put together. And 2,500 or so Turkish writers, editors and broadcasters have lost their jobs since the coup that failed. So much for press freedom in a land that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/27/boris-johnson-turkey-recep-tayyip-erdogan-lewd-poem-mevlut-cavusoglu-kurds\" title=\"\">Boris Johnson now says he wants to see inside the EU</a> (just as he heads in a different direction with a jar of Marmite stuffed up his jumper).</p> <p>Could things get any worse? Actually they grow bleaker the closer you look, because the arrests and the charges are so various, so chaotic and often so plain stupid. Turkey isn\u2019t just pursuing writers they think linked to that supposed G\u00fclenist plot, or Kurdish reporters with a random terrorism sticker plonked on their foreheads.</p> <p>Here\u2019s one case where the journalists involved were trying to warn the country about an impending coup. Slap a charge of disclosing military secrets on them. And here again, outrageously, are two of Turkey\u2019s most distinguished brothers, Ahmet and Mehmet Altan, one an ex-editor and renowned novelist, the other an economist and respected columnist, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/11/brothers-critical-turkish-regime-arrested-after-tv-programme\" title=\"\">held on the most farcical grounds</a>.</p> <p>When Ahmet Altan edited the <em>Taraf</em> newspaper from 2007 to 2012 he used his scorn and his stories to fend off any threats of a takeover. Mehmet argued passionately for a new Turkey united, not riven by race or religion. They are both champions of democracy: just like their father, \u00c7etin, another fine novelist and crusader for free journalism.</p> <p>The brothers were first arrested for giving \u201csubliminal signals\u201d about the coup on a TV chatshow. Hoots of derision. Now they\u2019re accused of \u201cactively conspiring\u201d to discredit the military, so as to open the way for a cadre of coup conspirators. More derision, but also fear. Ahmet still faces charges for being a member of a terrorist organisation and actually staging the 15 July coup. Life-sentence business.</p> <p>Seven years ago, before \u00c7etin Altan died, President Erdo\u011fan gave the old man a prize for intellectual valour. \u201cTurkey is not a country any more where \u00c7etin Altan is put on trial 300 times,\u201d Erdo\u011fan said. \u201cYou cannot move forward if you cannot tolerate the criticism.\u201d The problem now, as Turkey slides back, is finding either rhyme or reason in so many of the post-coup arrests and imprisonments.</p> <p>Is Erdo\u011fan on some solo rampage? Or \u2013 more likely, alas \u2013 are the virulent nationalists now in control bent on paying off old scores come what may? The temptation, as press freedom and much else dies, is to see it as some kind of masterfully controlled and implemented policy. But there\u2019s a still more depressing alternative. Call General Mayhem. It\u2019s retribution time.</p> <p>\u25a0 And so we say farewell to pixelated pictures of sex victims (in particular the teenage girl assaulted by the footballer Adam Johnson). An <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/oct/10/daily-telegraph-fined-80000-over-adam-johnson-photograph\" title=\"\">\u00a380,000 fine for the Daily Telegraph</a>, topped off by \u00a310,000 damages to the girl in question, sees to that.

Didn\u2019t the judge say that \u201cmore distress was caused by social media\u201d? Isn\u2019t it true that identification and pillorying by your Facebook flock may cause lasting, more personal pain? But astronomic fines have no relevance to other teenagers stirring the social media pot.</p> <p>The law, in Levesonian mode, still argues that newspapers are big, known quantities that QCs pushing bags stuffed with legal documents can deal with in traditional mode \u2013 while Facebook, Snapchat and the rest are somehow fleeting, elusive things floating in cyberspace. It\u2019s increasing, outdated rubbish. Pixelated thinking.</p>",
  "<p>Top BBC executives past and present naturally think well of the BBC. So Roger Mosey, who might have been Tony Hall\u2019s number two if he hadn\u2019t chosen Selwyn College, Cambridge, instead, holds corporation custom and practice high as the final Trump crunch nears.</p> <p>\u201cPeople like me who spent decades in the BBC are used to ideas of impartiality and balance. When there\u2019s a general election in the UK, the stopwatch comes out and \u2026 each party is given an arithmetical allocation of airtime. You will hear equally from the Conservatives and Labour, and a specified amount less for the smaller parties,\u201d he tells readers of <em>Varsity</em>. \u201cIn the US, this kind of regulation disappeared decades ago; but even so there has traditionally been an attempt at \u2018fair\u2019 coverage\u2026 \u201d</p> <p>Not any longer, Mosey fears. Trump, \u201ca brazen creator of news\u201d, has blown all that apart. \u201cI have, in my time as a journalist, sometimes been dismissive of regulators and what may appear to be a \u2018nanny state\u2019 approach to broadcasting in a time of unlimited digital choice. But what has happened in the US this year makes a formidable case for the kind of public broadcasting that remains strong in Europe.\u201d</p> <p>Up to a point, Master Mosey. It\u2019s undeniable that, on TV especially, Trump has got away with policy murder, and that Fox News has become a macabre joke. But two events in the past few days seem to have decided this whole campaign.</p> <p>One is the <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/02/us/politics/donald-trump-taxes.html\" title=\"\">New York Times\u2019s publication of a Trump tax return</a> that reveals why and how he may have paid no federal taxes for 18 years. According to some, the decision to print this return broke American law \u2013 straightforwardly, deliberately, but for good purpose. Would the BBC, in the last reaches of an election or referendum campaign, have challenged its own legal advice quite so boldly?</p> <p>And then there\u2019s the foul tape of locker-room-bantering Trumpism that came out of NBC\u2019s <em>Access Hollywood </em>archive. Who found it? A producer rummaging in cupboards? What did they do with it? Handed it up the corporate chain to top TV execs and their legal eagles. What did they do? They havered and pondered until someone sent a copy to the <em>Washington Post</em>, which promptly put the whole stinking package on its website.</p> <p>Full marks to the <em>Times</em> and <em>Post</em>. They did what journalists are there for. They reported the news. They changed this election. But TV and its learned friends behaved like huge corporations with something to lose. They sat on their hands too long.</p> <p>And what \u2013 just one more time \u2013 would the BBC have done, with fairness, balance and licence-fee retribution lowering large? Was its treatment of the Brexit referendum \u2013 in facts or disclosure \u2013 anything to write piously home about? The <em>Mail</em> and <em>Express</em> are taking an axe to Broadcasting House these days for noticing that the pound has gone pop. If we are doomed to spend the next two-and-a-half years arguing about what the vote meant, how does that reflect on the sharp focus of the coverage of the time? Fair or just fairly useless?</p>",

The cash originating in the UK flows to a parent company in Switzerland.</p> <p>The mind-boggling scale of the problem is laid bare in a slew of books and reports that reveal the way in which multinational companies have excused themselves from paying vast amounts of tax.</p> <p>The companies are a who\u2019s who of global brands: Apple, Nike, Google, Pepsi, Pfizer, Walmart, Goldman Sachs, and practically every other multinational in business.</p> <p>The detail can be complicated, but the method is simple \u2013 and legal. Companies set up subsidiaries in low or no-tax jurisdictions. These subsidiaries then charge the onshore parent for services or intellectual property or whatever, with the profits then funnelled legally offshore. US companies are only obliged to pay tax when they bring the money back.

It has booked $214.9bn offshore, a sum greater than any other company\u2019s offshore cash pile. If these profits were held in the US they would incur $65.4bn in tax. The European Commission recently ordered Apple to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/30/apple-pay-back-taxes-eu-ruling-ireland-state-aid\">pay Ireland $14.5 billion in back taxes</a>; its Irish subsidiaries were paying an effective tax rate of 0.005%. Apple\u2019s chief executive, Tim Cook, dismissed the ruling as \u201cpolitical crap\u201d.</p> <p>As a result it is ordinary taxpayers who have to pick up the tab. Last year George Osborne introduced a \u201cdiverted profit tax\u201d aimed at large companies that shift income artificially offshore. It\u2019s unclear if the former chancellor\u2019s initiative will work. Last weekend the <em>Observer</em> reported that Facebook had ended up with an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/09/facebook-uk-ends-up-11m-in-tax-credit-despite-global-profits-of-5bn\">\u00a311.3m tax credit on its UK business</a>. This is a company that made a global profit last year of $6.19bn.</p> <p>The new books include a page-turning account of the investigation into the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/series/panama-papers\">Panama Papers</a>. And an enterprising account of the wealth management industry by a writer who spent two years undercover as a trainee.</p> <p>Published last April, the Panama Papers were the fruits of a thrilling journalistic investigation. The papers \u2013 some 11.5m leaked documents from the Panamanian law firm Mossack Fonseca \u2013 give an unprecedented insight into the offshore world. They expose something obvious, previously hidden in plain sight. Namely that the global offshore industry \u2013 centred in tax havens such as the British Virgin Islands \u2013 was not, as had been thought, a shadowy but minor part of our economic system. Rather it was the system. It is this system that has allowed the burden of taxation to move inexorably from multinational corporations and the well-off to the \u201cunsmart\u201d: the dupes; you and me.</p> <p>The journalists who unearthed this bitter truth were Bastian Obermayer and Frederik Obermaier of Germany\u2019s <em>S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung</em>. (They are not related, but their German and international colleagues fondly nickname them the \u201cbrothers Obermay/ier\u201d.) The paper, based in Munich, has an excellent track record of working on difficult and important investigations.</p> <p>Reporters often get offered information, stuff. I know from previous investigations that this often turns out to be disappointing. As Obermayer recounts, in early 2015, late one evening, he received an anonymous message. It said: \u201cHello. John Doe here. Interested in secret data?\u201d Obermayer replied: \u201cAlways interested in secret data. What is it?\u201d</p> <p>The \u201cit\u201d turned out to be bigger than anyone might have imagined. The source \u2013 his or her identity remains unknown \u2013 had got hold of Mossack Fonseca\u2019s entire internal database. The legal practice was founded in 1977 by an ambitious Panamanian lawyer and the son of a Waffen SS officer. It specialised in setting up anonymous offshore shell companies.</p> <p>The source\u2019s motivation was simple. Like <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/edward-snowden\">Edward Snowden</a>, who lifted the lid on mass electronic surveillance, John Doe was a whistleblower. He/she wanted to expose the scale of injustice of the offshore tax system. Mossack Fonseca denies any wrongdoing.</p> <p>The leak was an act of bravery and amounted to the biggest data dump ever, delivered in real-time instalments. We got a whopping 2.6 terabytes. This was far larger than the top-secret Snowden files or the diplomatic cables leaked in 2010 by an unhappy US army private, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/chelsea-manning\">Chelsea Manning</a>, which revealed Washington\u2019s frank views of its global friends and enemies.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"80e2012fc53e6224282b6f563ec3b6b96256b854\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/80e2012fc53e6224282b6f563ec3b6b96256b854/0_117_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Leaked database from the Mossack Fonseca law firm in Panama revealed the extent of the use of offshore shell companies.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Leaked database from the Mossack Fonseca law firm in Panama revealed the extent of the use of offshore shell companies.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Carlos Jasso/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The Panama Papers include records of 214,000 offshore companies, names of real or \u201cbeneficial\u201d owners, and passport scans. There are bank statements, electricity bills and email chains. Often these are between Mossack Fonseca\u2019s head office in Panama and \u201cintermediaries\u201d, typically other lawyers, accountants and banks.</p> <p>Behind them were a large and diverse group of affluent individuals. We looked, naturally enough, for politicians and those holding public office. But the majority of names in the database belonged to what you might call the non-famous international rich. There were French dentists, Spanish lawyers and Swiss aristocrats, all seeking to minimise their taxes.</p> <p>The leak led to a year-long international collaboration in 80 countries. <em>S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung </em>shared its material with the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists, which is based in Washington.</p> <p>The ICIJ in turn gave access to the data to 100 media organisations and nearly 400 reporters. In Britain that was my newspaper the <em>Guardian</em> and the BBC.</p> <p>The journalists gave the leaked files a name. The Panama Papers was a conscious echo of the Pentagon Papers: volumes of secret documents leaked in 1971 by Daniel Ellsberg which revealed the true US war in Vietnam. Ellsberg swiped a mere 7,000 pages. We had enough reading material to last us about 25 years.</p> <p>I found myself back in the <em>Guardian</em>\u2019s investigations \u201cbunker\u201d. (Actually, it had a bucolic view of Regent\u2019s canal in London: houseboats, joggers, coots.) In 2013 I\u2019d been part of a small group which had studied the Snowden files here. We speculated at the time that MI6 had taken up residence in the flats opposite.</p> <p>This project was different. By means of a secure platform, called the iHub, journalists were encouraged not to compete with each other but to share information and to swap leads and tips. We did, in a flurry of encrypted emails. There were clandestine reporter meetings in Washington, Munich, and London.</p> <p>Early on we looked for Trump. Perhaps the database would point us towards his alleged secret fortune? It didn\u2019t. I did dig up a Russian businessman escaping from Moscow who wanted to buy an apartment in the Trump Ocean Club tower in Panama City. (The agent knocked off $200,000, offering the Trump penthouse for a bargain price of $2.31m.)</p> <p>Other themes gradually became clear. Britain, it turned out, didn\u2019t just feature via UK Crown dependencies like Jersey, Guernsey and the Isle of Man. Rather, it was the heart of the Mossack Fonseca multiverse. True, many of those diverting funds offshore were located in far-away kleptocracies: Russian oligarchs, African despots, and bagmen for Syria\u2019s murderer-president Bashar al-Assad.</p> <p>But it was British lawyers, banks and company formation agents that were facilitating this global tax avoidance. Often, the enablers were top London law firms. Their websites look eminently respectable: a view of Georgian stucco, offices in exclusive postcodes, a smart Farrow and Ball front door with neatly topiaried trees.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Britain didn\u2019t just feature via UK Crown dependencies. Rather, it was the heart of the rotten Mossack Fonseca multiverse</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The leaked documents told a different story. Sometimes, the lawyers would lie about their clients\u2019 identities and connections. Under banking regulations firms were meant to declare if a client was a politically exposed person or \u201cPEP\u201d. This would lead to stricter checks. The solution was to say nothing in the paperwork about a client\u2019s PEP status. In return, big fees.</p> <p>There may not have been bodies on the streets of Belgravia or Knightsbridge. But it was hard to escape the dispiriting sense that the British were the biggest crooks on the planet. Behind the facade of legal piety we were enabling an orgy of transnational theft, and the looting of entire continents such as Africa.</p> <p>The California-based French economist Gabriel Zucman estimates that 8% of the world\u2019s wealth \u2013 $7.6tn (\u00a35.3tn) \u2013 is currently stashed in tax havens. Zucman puts the loss to global tax revenues at $200bn per year. That includes $35bn in the US and $78bn in Europe. What might we do instead with this money?</p> <p>As President Obama noted tax avoidance was a huge global problem, made worse by the fact that offshore structures are perfectly legal. Many of these havens operate under British jurisdiction. More than half of Mossack Fonseca\u2019s companies are registered in the British Virgin Islands, a territory administered from London. The BVI has stubbornly rejected calls for greater transparency. Successive British governments have failed to act.</p> <p>We spent most of our bunker hours working the big names. They included David Cameron, who features indirectly, as well as a host of other colourful figures including Iceland\u2019s prime minister and Vladimir Putin\u2019s KGB-turned-oligarch pals.</p> <p>The database revealed that the offshore fund run by Cameron\u2019s late father Ian had paid no British tax. For three decades. The fund, Blairmore Holdings Inc, had gone to absurd lengths to pretend that it was based in the Bahamas, another major tax haven.</p> <p>It hired a small army of Bahamas residents to sign paperwork. One of them was a part-time bishop. All of this was legal \u2013 but a pantomime designed to keep Her Majesty\u2019s Revenue and Customs at bay.</p> <p>In the run up to publication, slotted for 3 April, we had two worries. One, that our investigation might itself leak. Journalists are a gossipy bunch. Two, that nobody would care. After all, when the <em>Guardian</em> published Snowden\u2019s revelations of state spying in 2013 most people in Britain \u2013 the land of James Bond \u2013 reacted with a weary shrug.</p> <p>In the end we needn\u2019t have worried. In Iceland the prime minister resigned. In Argentina there were protests. In Azerbaijan a small war suddenly initiated \u2013 so some believed \u2013 to distract from revelations featuring the president and his daughters. In China censors blocked the words \u201cPanama Papers\u201d and jammed the website of the <em>Guardian.</em> In Russia officials fumed about a western \u201cspy\u201d conspiracy.</p> <p>Downing Street refused to answer questions about Cameron\u2019s tax affairs, saying that they were a \u201cprivate matter\u201d. Eventually Cameron came clean: he\u2019d owned shares in his father\u2019s tax haven fund. He sold them for \u00a331,500 just before becoming prime minister in 2010.</p> <p>Cameron was reluctant to acknowledge what was obvious: that part of his family\u2019s fortune came from privileged offshore wealth.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fe4e015edf23411e0a502442aff3595bdc000770\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fe4e015edf23411e0a502442aff3595bdc000770/0_403_6706_4025/1000.jpg\" alt=\"More than half of the companies that appear in the Panama Papers are registered in the British Virgin Islands\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">More than half of the companies that appear in the Panama Papers are registered in the British Virgin Islands</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Viewed in retrospect, this was the beginning of the end of Cameron. Weeks later he hosted a global anti-corruption summit in London. He announced a clampdown on offshore havens. The UK would introduce a new register that would compel foreign companies owning British property to declare their owner, thereby cleaning up London as a centre for international money-laundering.</p> <p>It was a start. But Cameron stopped short of compelling British overseas territories from outing the real owners of offshore firms. Without a public register the offshore industry \u2013 with its satellites of lawyers and banks \u2013 was free to carry on as before. The BVI, meanwhile, boycotted the London summit and stayed at home.</p> <p>The picture, then, is a lousy one. But the Panama Papers offer a few rays of hope. In recent years the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development and western governments have tried to clamp down on tax evasion, mindful of the billions being lost during a time of austerity. Pressure has been growing on offshore centres to swap information. Increasingly, the Swiss and others are complying.</p> <p>All this has induced a degree of paranoia among Mossack Fonseca\u2019s well-heeled clients. Emails show that the super-rich have adopted various protective strategies to stop the tax man from knocking. Some of them use fake names. We found Harry Potter, Winnie Pooh and Daniel Radcliffe. (Not the real one.) Plus Isaac Azimov, who turned out to be a tax lawyer from Barcelona.</p> <p>Offshore agents report that their Italian clients are going to desperate lengths to avoid being caught. When visiting Switzerland they leave the Ferrari behind and take a less conspicuous car. They also seek to cover their trail by \u201clayering\u201d: using a chain of offshore companies, rather than just one, to bury an asset.</p> <p>Still, the past six months have seen a victory of sorts for those of us, the little people, who do pay our taxes. From now on, the super-rich and other characters who use exotic offshore structures will be a nervous bunch. How long, they must be wondering, before the next leak?</p>",

There are chapters on \u2018Reliability\u2019 \u2013 temperamental, trouble starting in morning; \u2018Sound systems/In-Car audio\u2019 \u2013 ghastly teenage music; \u2018Bodykits and Accessorising\u2019 \u2013 clothes, image and \u2018look\u2019, and \u2018Interface Connection Problems\u2019 \u2013 not understanding them. The chapter on \u2018The Horn\u2019 \u2013 handling new relationships and approaching sex talks is brilliant. Discovering that what drives <em>you</em> mad is exactly what drives every <em>other</em> parent mad is very funny and quite therapeutic. </p> <p>The manuals are \u00a36.99, and will make perfect little Christmas fillers!

  "<p>Marmite, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/eu-referendum\" title=\"\">Brexit</a>: both are sticky, strongly flavoured and loved or hated in about even measure. So it is rather appropriate that the row and ensuing panic over a hike in the price of the yeasty spread was the moment when we could say that we passed peak euphoria for the Brexiters.</p> <p>In the immediate aftermath of the referendum, they felt entitled to be extremely pleased with themselves. They won when most of them expected to lose. They destroyed the prime minister who tried to stop them and punched the establishment in the mouth. Remainers who had warned that divorcing the EU would unleash severe economic shocks were left looking a bit foolish because those consequences did not materialise immediately.</p> <p>The Outers had a success during the referendum in persuading many voters to ignore the \u201cso-called\u201d experts on the other side and their cautions that there would be a steep bill to pay. You may recall that some of those much-derided experts did predict that Brexit would trigger a fall in the value of the pound with the result that the prices of many household goods would go up. You may also recall that this was dismissed as \u201cscare-mongering\u201d by \u201cProject Fear\u201d.</p> <p>Now some of the consequences of Brexit are beginning to knock on the door. The loudest knock \u2013 more of an almighty crash, actually \u2013 is the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/12/british-shoppers-told-to-expect-price-rises-after-steep-fall-in-pound\" title=\"\">tumble in the value of the pound</a>. It has slumped a long way against the euro and plunged even more dramatically against the dollar. \u201cTake back control\u201d served the Outers well as a referendum campaign slogan. It was probably their most effective persuader. It was also a highly misleading guide to what would happen in a world in which a government does not have unalloyed sovereignty even over its currency. A pound is only worth as much as the world is willing to pay for it. If the world starts to believe that Britain\u2019s economic prospects have darkened and that the country has become a less attractive destination for foreign investment, then the world will be less inclined to hold pounds. If the world starts to think that Britain is becoming less politically stable, a more unpredictable place to do business and a more risky country to lend to, then the world will be even less enthusiastic about owning pounds.</p> <p>The slumping value of sterling tells us that this is exactly what the world now thinks. Markets are reacting to a government that is on a trajectory towards a \u201chard\u201d Brexit that will be incompatible with remaining within the single market and may well see Britain\u2019s departure from the European customs union as well. Companies are becoming spooked as they grasp how protracted the negotiation with the EU is going to be. Those company bosses who have managed to secure time with the ministers in charge of the process come away not reassured by the conversations, but more disturbed. They shudder that the people who are supposed to be directing the process don\u2019t really know what they are doing or agree with one another about where they are headed.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The Brexiter ministers continue to insist that ultimately the EU will want to give Britain a sweetheart deal</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The pound has become a \u201cpolitical currency\u201d and not in a good way. It would be a mistake to think that the rest of the globe follows every cough and splutter of our domestic debates, but they do hear enough of it to catch the general drift. The noise coming out of the mouths of senior Tories at their party conference was belligerent enough to be heard everywhere. It broadcast the message that Mrs May\u2019s Britain is turning hostile to talent and investment from abroad. The government has since rowed back on some of it, executing a forced retreat from the idea of compelling businesses to declare how many of their staff are from other countries, but the overall tone still echoes in everyone\u2019s ears.</p> <p>The martial music played by senior Tories is now being reciprocated from the other side of the channel. There is a toughening of the language being used by EU leaders and even by figures who were originally seen as conciliators. Donald Tusk, the president of the European Council, has generally been regarded as more sympathetic to Britain and more willing to help achieve a gentle uncoupling rather than an acrimonious rupture. A member of the cabinet to whom I spoke recently identified Mr Tusk as the man they hoped that they could do business with rather than Jean-Claude Juncker and a European commission that is seen as determined to follow a \u201cpunishment strategy\u201d of maximising the pain inflicted on Britain for jilting the EU. Yet it was Mr Tusk who last week made a point of ridiculing the \u201ccake philosophy\u201d of Boris Johnson, as in you can have your cake and eat it. Oh no you can\u2019t, retorted Mr Tusk. He invited any adherents to the foreign secretary\u2019s brand of magical thinking to conduct a simple experiment. Buy a cake, consume it and then take a look at what is left on the plate. The choice for Britain, he declared, was not soft or hard Brexit, but <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/13/its-hard-brexit-or-no-brexit-at-all-says-eu-council-president\" title=\"\">hard Brexit or no Brexit</a>. That is a precise echo of what the hard Brexiters in Mrs May\u2019s government are saying.</p> <p>The Brexiter ministers continue to insist that ultimately the EU will want to give Britain a sweetheart deal. Everything coming back from the other side suggests the opposite and for entirely understandable reasons. European leaders are not wavering in the clarity with which they declare that Britain cannot be seen to get a better deal from being outside the EU than it had as a member. They will be able to give that message in person to Mrs May this week when she travels to Brussels for her first European Council as prime minister.</p> <p>There is a risk to making any comment on the falling pound; the risk is to be accused of being a poor loser, a \u201cRemoaner\u201d, a miserable naysayer who refuses to embrace the wonderful vista of opportunities that are presented by having a collapsing currency. It is true that there are some upsides to a plunging pound. It will make some British exports more competitive, provided that their manufacture doesn\u2019t rely on a lot of imported parts. Higher prices for things made abroad may encourage Britons to reduce their appetite for imported goods, which would help to close our yawning trade deficit. The cut-price pound will also make Britain a bargain destination for tourists. Nigel Farage will be able to celebrate all the extra foreigners that Brexit is drawing to our shores.</p> <p>But it is another delusion to think that devaluation is a perfect economic tonic. If it were that, Britain should already be the envy of the world. Since we came off the gold standard in the 1930s, when a pound bought five dollars, this country has experienced a lot of devaluations, planned and unplanned. If making your currency cheaper was the route to riches, our streets ought to be encrusted with diamonds by now.</p> <p>The main political consequence of a falling pound will be felt in a spike in inflation. We will be paying more for petrol, clothing, food, electrical goods and all the other stuff that this country buys from abroad. Inflation, which has been dormant for a considerable period, is set to have a resurgence in its salience as a political issue. The governor of the Bank of England is right to say that these price rises will inflict the hardest hit on those least able to bear it, because people on lower wages spend proportionately more of their income on the things that are going to get more expensive. A rise in inflation will also impact on the cost of anything that is index-linked, which means paying more for everything from rail fares to water.</p> <p>It is already worrying ministers that increased inflation will also have a significant knock-on effect for the government\u2019s finances, which weren\u2019t exactly in rude health before this happened. Among other things, it will make it more expensive for the government to keep its pricey promise to increase the state pension by at least inflation. It will add further pressure on public services, not least the NHS. If the cost of living is going up, public sector workers will think they deserve a compensating rise in pay and will become seriously discontented if they don\u2019t get it. Mrs May inherited a policy of freezing benefits and credits for lower-paid workers. The pain for those subjected to that freeze will be increased if their cost of living is escalating. Private sector workers will either extract wage rises from their employers to offset increases in prices, with all the further consequences that has, or they will suffer a degradation in their living standards. The number of people who are only \u201cjust about managing\u201d, to use Mrs May\u2019s phrase, will increase. So will the number who can\u2019t manage.</p> <p>But I don\u2019t want to sound like a \u201cRemoaner\u201d, so I am delighted to report that there will be one group of people for whom a plunging pound is very good news indeed. London property has just become massively cheaper if you are a foreign buyer. For holders of dollars and euros and other \u201ccitizens of the world\u201d, the sale is now on. Britain is becoming a poundland bargain \u2013 so long as you don\u2019t actually earn your living here.</p>",
