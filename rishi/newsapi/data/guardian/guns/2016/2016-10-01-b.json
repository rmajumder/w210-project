[
  "<p>In February 2007 a strike team from 1 Yorks Regiment raided an Iraqi house believing that it held a Mahdi Army insurgent who was making improvised explosive devices for use against coalition forces.</p> <p>Tensions were running high. The week before, two soldiers from the regiment had been killed and another two seriously injured in IED attacks. According to testimony filed in court by one of the team, which was retracted and then resubmitted, they entered the house and found an \u201cunknown male \u2026 messing about with an EFP (explosively formed penetrator) IED.\u201d</p> <p>The unknown male was Abd Ali Hameed al-Waheed who alleges that after being assaulted he was bundled into a vehicle by the soldiers who threw an acidic liquid into his eyes and used what felt like \u201ccutter pliers\u201d to \u201cpinch and twist\u201d his skin. The Ministry of Defence contends that the injuries were inflicted by the Mahdi Army before the soldiers had arrived and that Waheed was an insurgent.</p> <p>Now, in a high-profile case that has provoked a furore in the Daily Mail and the Daily Telegraph, the armed forces and government and which has come to crystalise the row over \u2018ambulance chasing lawyers\u2019 versus British troops, Waheed is seeking compensation from the MoD for alleged mistreatment and unlawful detention. His is one of three test cases filed against the MoD that will help the judge hearing them, Mr Justice Leggatt, determine how to proceed with a further 600 or so similar claims. The MoD has already opted to settle one of the three cases. This is in addition to about 300 or so other claims it has already settled, paying out almost \u00a320m. About a dozen cases have been dropped.</p> <p>According to his closing submission filed into court, many of Waheed\u2019s claims have gone unchallenged by the MoD. He alleges that he was subject to sensory deprivation, held in solitary confinement and denied adequate shelter, bedding, food and water. The MoD, which declined to call as a witness the Royal Military Police captain assigned to investigate Waheed\u2019s injuries, is resisting his claim for compensation.</p> <p>\u201cOpportunistic claims arising from operations overseas are costing the taxpayer millions of pounds,\u201d a spokeswoman for the MoD explained. \u201cThe MOD will continue to vigorously defend these claims whenever possible.\u201d</p> <p>Records show that shortly after Waheed was captured, a Dr Moy emailed a Major Hazelton of the Royal Military Police. \u201cI have concerns regarding the handling of Internee 91057 [Waheed]. He has arrived at the DTDF [divisional temporary detainment facility] with extensive bruising over his upper back and arms. This bruising is linear, and suggestive of being struck repeatedly with an implement. I suggest that it is unlikely these injuries were sustained during a struggle; he appears to have been deliberately beaten.\u201d</p> <p>Within hours of Waheed being picked up, investigators with the army\u2019s joint forward intelligence team (JFIT) expressed doubts about their captive. \u201cIt is now possible that 91057 is, in fact, not involved in the manufacture of IEDs,\u201d one JFIT email states. \u201cHowever, we have yet to reliably establish the full extent of his involvement.\u201d</p> <p>A few days later another email noted: \u201cThe subject can provide no more information on Ali Jaleel [a suspected bombmaker and the chief target of the raid] and that he has not been involved in any militant activities.\u201d</p> <p>An email on 24 February 2007 \u2013 almost a fortnight after Waheed was seized \u2013 concluded: \u201cThere is a dearth of exploitable information regarding this subject, and it does appear to the JFIT that this is a case of \u2018wrong place, wrong time\u2019. He has shown his willingness to provide ... any information required.\u201d</p> <p>In March a decision was taken to release Waheed. But what of the soldier\u2019s testimony that Waheed was found with an IED? Documents show that after he was seized, a swab taken from him was run through a particle detector to identify trace residues. The detector showed a one-bar reading, which means, according to the forensic specialist who ran the test, that \u201che was far away from an explosive\u201d.</p> <p>Establishing what happened during the raid - where it is accepted that bombs were discovered - would benefit from photographs or video footage of Waheed\u2019s capture. Guidance on strike operations makes clear such recordings should be taken, but much of the footage, and that of many of Waheed\u2019s interrogation sessions, is missing.</p> <p>The case comes at a combustible time. The Iraq historic allegations team (Ihat), set up by the Labour government to investigate allegations of abuse by British forces, stands accused of hounding former soldiers through the courts. The defence secretary, Michael Fallon, has complained that they are \u201cvictims of a witch hunt\u201d. Theresa May, the prime minister, has said she is determined to protect the armed forces against \u201cvexatious complaints\u201d and will use this week\u2019s Tory party conference to announce a crackdown on no-win, no-fee lawyers. Yesterday the former head of the armed forces, Lord Dannatt, called for Ihat to be wound down.</p> <p>\u201cThis is a battle between the armed forces, politicians and lawyers, and there is a feeling that lawyers should butt out,\u201d said John Cooper, QC, who has represented the families of armed forces personnel in many cases against the MoD. \u201cLawyers expect to be given as much as we give out, but when politicians start wading in and almost supporting the undermining of legal firms and lawyers for taking cases which, after all, is their job, it becomes very worrying indeed.\u201d About 100 of the 600 or so civil claims \u2013 including that of Waheed \u2013 being brought against the MoD by the law firm Leigh Day have been referred to Ihat, <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/545281/20160725-IHAT-Quarterly_Update_website_Jun16.pdf\">which is now investigating almost 1,500 alleged incident</a>s. Nevertheless, the two discrete legal processes have become conflated in many people\u2019s minds.</p> <p>This is partly due to the fallout from <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/al-sweady-inquiry-report\">the Al-Sweady Inquiry, the \u00a331m investigation </a>into the alleged abuse of Iraqi detainees, which found that claims of murder and torture against British troops were the result of \u201cdeliberate lies, reckless speculation and ingrained hostility\u201d. Public Interest Lawyers, one of the firms that brought the claims, was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/aug/15/public-interest-lawyers-iraq-war-al-sweady-theresa-may-uk-troops\">closed down after questions were raised</a> about the evidence it presented to the inquiry. Leigh Day meanwhile has been referred by the Solicitors Regulation Authority (SRA) to the Solicitors Disciplinary Tribunal (SDT) to answer allegations about the way it handled some of the cases. The firm denies the allegations and says that the referral to the SRA by the MoD was \u201cpolitical\u201d.</p> <p>Cooper also believes that the backlash against the lawyers confronting the MoD has a political context, taking place as it does amid calls for troops in combat conditions to be exempted from the Human Rights Act: \u201cI\u2019m not saying that when you are in hand -to-hand combat you\u2019ve got to start thinking, does this breach the law? But it should apply in cases where there have been substantiated allegations of torturing people in custody.\u201d</p> <p>That detainees have suffered at the hands of British troops is accepted. Even the Al-Sweady inquiry concluded that some detainees had been mistreated, though not deliberately. Last month three British soldiers who forced an Iraqi teenager into a canal \u2013 a practice known as \u201cwetting\u201d \u2013 which resulted in him drowning were condemned by a judge.</p> <p>The<a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/279190/1452_i.pdf\"> Baha Mousa inquiry</a> concluded that the hotel worker\u2019s death in British army custody was caused by \u201cfactors including lack of food and water, heat, exhaustion, fear, previous injuries and the hooding and stress positions used by British troops \u2013 and a final struggle with his guards\u201d. The inquiry heard that Mousa suffered at least 93 injuries prior to his death in September 2003 and that several practices he was subjected to were banned by UK law and the Geneva convention.</p> <p>Whatever the truth of Waheed\u2019s claims against the MoD, his case, like that of many other detainees bringing actions, highlights the army\u2019s abject failure to anticipate what to do with them once it became an occupying force, a failure identified from the outset by Lieutenant-Colonel Nicholas Mercer, the army\u2019s chief legal adviser in Iraq.</p> <p>Mercer told the Baha Mousa inquiry: \u201cI was acutely aware of the complete lack of planning for detainees and internees \u2026 and raised this repeatedly through the chain of command.\u201d</p> <p>But in postwar Iraq detainees were not a priority. Among the documents forming part of the Waheed case is the joint forward intelligence team operational directive issued to his interrogators. It urges: \u201cManipulate each internee as you see fit to suit your own ends. Do not worry about upsetting them.\u201d</p> <h2>Legal claims against British troops</h2> <p><strong>Baha Mousa Inquiry</strong></p> <p>Baha Mousa, a 26-year-old hotel receptionist, died in custody in 2003. An inquiry chaired by Sir William Gage found that he had been beaten by large numbers of British soldiers, and subject to sleep deprivation, banned stress positions and hooding. Corporal Donald Payne was convicted of inhuman treatment and jailed for a year.</p> <p><strong>Al-Sweady Inquiry</strong><br></p> <p>It was alleged that British troops killed 20 unarmed civilians and abused others detained after a battle with Shia insurgents in 2004. The inquiry, chaired by Sir Thayne Forbes, concluded that all the dead had been killed in battle and . the allegations were \u201cwithout merit\u201d.</p> <p><strong>Ihat</strong></p> <p>Established in March 2010, the Iraq Historic Allegations Team was set up by the MoD to investigate allegations of unlawful conduct and abuse of Iraqi civilians by the British armed forces. Ihat has a remit to refer allegations with sufficient evidence to the Service Prosecutions Authority and dispose of those it judges to be baseless. As of March, Ihat was investigating 1,374 cases involving more than 1,500 victims.</p> <p><strong>Public Interest Lawyers and Leigh Day</strong><br></p> <p>In April, amid concerns about its use of the evidence, PIL, the law firm behind many of the claims investigated by the Al-Sweady inquiry, was referred to the Solicitors Disciplinary Tribunal and wound up soon after. The MoD has also referred another law firm involved in the Al-Sweady inquiry, Leigh Day, to the SRA. The firm says it intends to contest claims against it.</p>",
  "<p>One of the few advantages of Brexit is that the unfolding debacle may be the trigger for the deep economic, political and constitutional reform that Britain so badly needs. It will only be by living through the searing events ahead that people will become convinced that the indulgent Eurosceptic untruths they have been fed are not only economically disastrous but open the way to forms of racism that most Britons, Leave voters included, instinctively find repellent. Brexit will force home some brutal realities.</p> <p>Leave voters in Sunderland \u2013 61% in favour \u2013 will have woken up on Friday to the news that Renault Nissan, the largest car plant in Europe and a crucial pillar of the local economy, employing 7,000 people, has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/sep/30/jaguar-land-rover-brexit-ralf-speth-eu-british-cars\" title=\"\">deferred all new investment</a> until the details of Brexit are clear. The chief executive, Carlos Ghosn, explained that it was not because the company did not value its Sunderland plant, its most efficient. Rather, as a major exporter to the EU, its profitability depends on the prevailing tariff regime, which promises to change sharply for the worse. \u201cImportant investment decisions,\u201d he said, \u201cwould not be made in the dark.\u201d</p> <p>It is hard to fault Ghosn\u2019s reasoning. Gaining control of EU immigration is both a matter of personal conviction and a political necessity for Theresa May. But how can that be squared with ongoing membership of the customs union that defines the single market and which requires acceptance of free movement? Concessions can only be minimal without wrecking the EU\u2019s core structures. Moreover, the Tory hard Brexiters, wedded to the notion of a clean break from an EU they detest, are in the political ascendancy.</p> <p>One senior official tells me that a hard Brexit is inevitable: the best that can be hoped for is perhaps some agreement on the movement of skilled people, but beyond that the future is trading on the terms organised by the World Trade Organisation.</p> <p>If so, Renault Nissan will face up to 10% tariffs on the cars it ships to the EU. Unless the UK government is prepared to compensate it, a bill that could top \u00a3350m a year, it cannot make new investments. The Sunderland economy will be devastated. The same is true for the entire UK car industry. Last Wednesday, <a href=\"http://uk.reuters.com/article/us-autoshow-paris-jaguarlandrover-idUKKCN1201FK\" title=\"\">Jaguar Land Rover</a> made similar remarks: if the position had been more explicit and fairly reported rather than airily dismissed as Project Fear, the wafer-thin 3,800 majority for Leave in Birmingham might have switched their vote.</p> <p>Every part of our economy involved in selling into Europe will be affected both by the rise in tariffs and by the new necessity to guarantee that our products and services meet EU regulatory standards, the so-called passport. This doesn\u2019t only apply to the City where 5,500 UK registered firms turn out to hold the invaluable passport, but to tens of thousand of companies across the economy.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Britain is now one of the most unequal countries in Europe, with immigration the tinder for enmity and hate</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The Brexiters insist the losses will be more than compensated for by the wave of trade deals now open to be signed, but trade deals take many years to negotiate. More crucially, there is no free-trade world out there; rather, there is a series of painstakingly constructed, reciprocal entries to markets, the biggest of which we are now abandoning. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/30/anna-soubry-brands-liam-foxs-free-trade-speech-delusional\" title=\"\">Liam Fox is delusional</a>, as former business minister, Anna Soubry, declares, to pretend otherwise.</p> <p>Nor do hard Brexiters confront the fact that alongside China and the US, Britain has accumulated a stunning $1tn-plus stock of foreign direct investment. Nearly 500 multinationals have regional or global headquarters here, more than twice the rest of Europe combined. They are here to take advantage of our ultra pro-business environment \u2013 so much for the Eurosceptic babble about being stifled by Brussels \u2013 and trade freely with the EU. Britain was becoming a combination of New York and California, with a whole continental hinterland in which to trade. Hard Brexit kills all that stone dead and puts phantoms in its place.</p> <p>The years ahead will be ones of economic dislocation and stagnation. But the impact goes well beyond the economic. Hard Brexit legitimises anti-foreigner and anti-immigrant sentiment. When Britain\u2019s flag outside the EU institutions is brought down and Messrs Farage, Davis, Johnson, Redwood, Fox et al delightedly hail the sovereignty and supremacy of Britishness, it could signal a new round of street-baiting of anybody who does not look and sound British: expect more attacks on Poles and Czechs from Essex to Yorkshire.</p> <p>Politicians of right and left are fighting shy of delivering the condemnation this deserves. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/27/jeremy-corbyn-rules-out-pledge-cut-immigration\" title=\"\">Rachel Reeves</a>\u2019s remarks at the Labour fringe, warning of a social explosion if immigration were not immediately curbed, show how far the permissible discourse on immigration and race has changed. Britain has moved over the past 50 years from being one of the most equal countries in Europe to the most unequal. The result is rising social tension, with immigration the tinder for enmity and hate. The hard-working immigrants who add so much vitality and energy to our society are blamed for ills that have deeper roots. Brexit has made this harder to say.</p> <p>This conjunction of the economically and socially noxious horrifies not only me but also many Tories. Scotland\u2019s Ruth Davidson, a bevy of ex-ministers, some in the cabinet and a large number of backbenchers are keenly aware of the slippery racist, culturally regressive and economically calamitous course their Brexiter colleagues are set on and are ready to fight for the soul of their party. George Osborne is positioning himself as their leader. It is an impending civil war, mirroring parallel feelings in the country at large.</p> <p>Beyond that, the referendum raised profound constitutional questions. In other democracies, treaty and constitutional changes require at least 60% majorities in either the legislature or in a referendum. Britain\u2019s unwritten constitution offers no such rules: a parliamentary majority confers monarchial power so a referendum can be called without any such framing. Article 50 is to be invoked without a parliamentary vote: a change of government in effect without a general election.</p> <p>In good times, the constitution interests only obsessives. Suddenly, Britain\u2019s constitutional vacuity is part of a deep national crisis. The economic and political structures, along with the biased media, that delivered this are rotten. The question is whether the will \u2013 and political coalitions \u2013 can be built to reform them. If not, Britain is sliding towards nasty, sectarian decline.</p>",
  "<p>He struggled through the frozen wastes of North America in his Oscar-winning performance in <em>The Revenant</em>. Now Leonardo DiCaprio is starring in a different role \u2013 taking his powerful new eco-documentary to the White House, in the hope it can help restart <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2016/sep/03/obama-us-china-have-joined-paris-climate-pact-g20-video\" title=\"\">President Obama\u2019s battle against global warming</a>.</p> <p>It\u2019s an issue of importance to both men.

Last month he created the world\u2019s largest ecologically protected area when he <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/sep/06/hawaii-marine-ocean-conservation-papahanaumokuakea\" title=\"\">expanded Papah\u0101naumoku\u0101kea</a>, a marine reserve in his native Hawaii, to encompass more than half a million square miles. He also gave \u201cmarine national monument\u201d status to 4,913 sq miles off the New England coast.</p> <p>Two years ago, DiCaprio \u2013 who has raised money for protecting tigers, orangutans and elephants \u2013 was designated a UN messenger of peace, with a special focus on climate change.</p> <p>The White House screening of <em>Before the Flood</em>, which follows DiCaprio as he travels to parts of the world including Greenland, the Pacific islands, Sumatra and industrial regions of China, precedes a global release via National Geographic later this month. DiCaprio and the film\u2019s director, Fisher Stevens, hope to use it in the run-up to next month\u2019s US presidential and Senate elections. They plan to show the film on college campuses and across swing states, including Florida, where <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jun/22/marco-rubio-re-election-florida-senate-seat\" title=\"\">Senator Marco Rubio is up for re-election</a>.</p> <p>\u201cRubio is a climate change denier, and we want to get these deniers out of Congress, to make them understand the Paris [climate] accords are important and that we need to do more,\u201d Stevens said. The film-makers claim 38 US senators accept money from the energy industry, in effect blocking the passage of environmental legislation.</p> <p>\u201cThese people are not necessarily climate deniers. They\u2019re just in the pockets of the energy industry, even though that\u2019s at the expense of all of us,\u201d said Fisher. \u201cAnd [Republican presidential candidate] Donald Trump has said he\u2019s going to try to kill the Paris accords if elected.\u201d</p> <p>Last month DiCaprio told the audience after the film\u2019s world premiere at the Toronto international film festival: \u201cWe cannot afford, at this critical moment in time, to have leaders in office that do not believe in the modern science of climate change.\u201d</p> <p><em>Before the Flood</em>\u2019s release comes as statistics relating to the health of the planet worsen. Last week the Scripps Institution of Oceanography announced it was safe to conclude that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/sep/28/the-world-passes-400ppm-carbon-dioxide-threshold-permanently\" title=\"\">global CO<sub>2</sub> levels</a> will not drop below 400 parts per million this year \u2013 \u201cor ever again for the indefinite future\u201d.

It\u2019s a simplistic message but it really is.\u201d</p> <p>Despite the intransigence of US legislators, Obama is using his last months in office to establish his legacy as the most environmentally effective president since Theodore Roosevelt created national parks. In Obama\u2019s reading of the issue, climate change is as much a national security issue as an environmental one.</p> <p>He tells the film-makers: \u201cIn addition to the sadness I\u2019d feel if my kids can never see a glacier the way I did in Alaska, even if you were unsentimental about that, you\u2019ve got to be worried about national security and the capacity of the world order to survive the kinds of strains climate scientists are predicting.\u201d</p> <p>Sixty-one countries, including China and the US, representing about 48% of global emissions, have adopted the Paris accords. Countries representing at least 55% of emissions have to adopt the accords for them to be ratified.</p> <p>The film-makers visit Pope Francis in the Vatican, Obama in Washington, political leaders in the Pacific islands of Vanuatu and Kiribati, climate scientists in Greenland and the Indian conservationist Sunita Narain, who explains to DiCaprio that access to energy is as much an issue as climate change for 300 million Indians.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry to say this to you, as an American, but your consumption is really going to put a hole in the planet,\u201d Narain tells DiCaprio. \u201cWe need to put the issue of lifestyle and consumption at the centre of climate negotiations. \u201d</p> <p>DiCaprio responds that it\u2019s difficult to present to Americans the argument that they need to change their lifestyle. \u201cI would also argue that it\u2019s probably not going to happen,\u201d he says. If the climate crisis is to be solved, it will be because \u201crenewables will become cheaper the more we invest into them, and that will solve the problem\u201d. But Narain shakes her head.</p> <p>The film-makers have enlisteded Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross, the pair behind the <em>The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo</em>, for the soundtrack. They use Hieronymus Bosch\u2019s triptych <em>The Garden of Earthly Delights</em> \u2013 which made a strong impression on the young DiCaprio \u2013 to frame the progress of humankind\u2019s impact on the planet, from innocence to Bosch\u2019s final panel of darkness and ruin.</p> <p>How far off are we now, they wonder? \u201cWhat haunts me is the last panel, with the planet in ruins, charred and blackened skies,\u201d DiCaprio muses. \u201cIf this was a movie we could write our way out of this mess, but real life isn\u2019t a movie and we can\u2019t pretend we know how this is going to end.\u201d</p> <p>He adds: \u201cWhat we can do is control what we do next, how we live our lives, what we consume \u2013 and how we vote, to let our leaders know that we know the truth.\u201d</p> <p>One passage of the documentary takes place during the filming of <em>The Revenant,</em> when director Alejandro Gonz\u00e1lez I\u00f1\u00e1rritu was forced to move production 9,000 miles from a snow-free Canadian location to Argentina in search of a snowy landscape.</p>",
  "<p>Some years ago, at the beginning of my political career, I campaigned for an end to female genital mutilation and for tougher penalties for those responsible for carrying it out. Little did I ever imagine that I would be in the position, as home secretary, where it would be my job to drive on the government\u2019s efforts to get rid of this brutal practice. It is one of my absolute priorities \u2013 working with the police and other agencies \u2013 to see this government is the one under which there is the first successful prosecution and punishment of a perpetrator of this horrible crime.</p> <p>And let\u2019s be clear about that: it is a crime. The law in this country is not there to be compromised or to be blinkered. FGM, \u201chonour-based violence\u201d, and forced marriage are illegal. They are pernicious forms of abuse of women and we will not shy away from tackling them because of cultural sensitivities.</p> <p>We have made progress. We have introduced measures to protect women and girls. We now have laws such as a new offence of domestic abuse that covers controlling and coercive behaviour. Prosecutions have begun for stalking offences, forced marriage is criminalised and the \u201crevenge pornography\u201d law that came into effect last year should start to bring an end to the humiliation and pain caused when ex-partners share intimate images online.</p> <p>These are some, but by no means all, of the powerful means we have at our disposal to tackle violence against women and girls. From <a href=\"http://www.cps.gov.uk/news/latest_news/vawg_report_2016/\" title=\"\">Crown Prosecution Service figures</a> last month, it is clear the volume of prosecutions and convictions is at its highest ever level, meaning more victims are seeing justice than ever before. But the reality is that you can\u2019t legislate your way out of everything. Much of the challenge is about stopping vulnerable people becoming victims in the first place. Giving people the voice they need to seek help and supporting them as the scars \u2013 both the ones you can see and the ones you can\u2019t \u2013 begin to heal.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We still have much, much more to do to reveal the true scale of hidden vulnerability</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>We also have to be honest with ourselves and confront some brutal truths about the society we live in and we have to be prepared to have some difficult conversations about some distressing subjects. There are still far, far too many women \u2013 and men \u2013 who are the victims of domestic abuse, who are beaten, who live in fear in their own homes, who are stripped of their sense of self, isolated from friends and family by coercive partners. It is a terrifying and disturbing pattern with which those who have been listening to Helen Titchener\u2019s harrowing storyline in <em>The Archers</em> will be familiar.</p> <p>The toxic wake of scandals such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2014/jun/26/jimmy-savile-sexual-abuse-timeline\" title=\"\">Savile</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/jun/06/rotherham-child-sexual-abuse-few-victims-identified-nca\" title=\"\">Rotherham</a>, and the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/sep/28/ben-emmerson-counsel-child-sexual-abuse-inquiry-sacked-concerns-over-leadership\" title=\"\">independent inquiry into child sexual abuse</a>, has exploded into the public consciousness an awareness of child exploitation and abuse the like of that simply did not exist before. The only way to ever neutralise that toxicity, and give victims and survivors the justice they deserve, is to be utterly unsparing about the failings that led us here and what lessons must be learned.</p> <p>Transparency and public discourse are crucial. We can\u2019t treat issues as taboo because we find them unpleasant. We must lift the shroud of silence and light up the dark corners that allow the perpetrators to operate. That public discourse must also make clear which behaviours are acceptable and which are not. It matters what those in the public eye say. This is something I would urge the shadow chancellor to reflect upon, long and hard. Remarks about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2010/jun/07/john-mcdonnell-assassinate-thatcher-joke\" title=\"\">lynching or assassinating female politicians </a>\u2013 any politicians \u2013 are not jokes. And they are not funny, whoever they are made about.</p> <p>The reality is that there is still too much that goes on behind closed doors and we still have much, much more to do to reveal the true scale of hidden vulnerability. Protecting children at risk of exploitation will always be a priority and at the other end, safeguarding an ageing population brings its own challenges.

  "<p>Many of the 70,000 children in the care of the state will have experienced abject neglect or abuse at the hands of parents unable or unwilling to provide the care and nurture that comes naturally to most families. While adoption will only be appropriate for a minority of these children, it can be transformative, offering them the best chance of growing up in a stable, permanent, loving home.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/sep/29/adoption-numbers-drop-steeply-as-governments-flagship-policy-falters\" title=\"\">12% drop in the number of children being adopted in the year </a>ending in March is therefore deeply concerning.

Martin Narey, the former chief executive of Barnardo\u2019s, observed in his 2011 investigation into the adoption system: \u201cFrequently, a child is living in observed neglect for many months, years sometimes, before first being removed to care.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Adoption rates have only risen when senior politicians  have made the issue a political priority</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Adoption faces similar issues in the courts.

Adoption rates have only risen when senior politicians such as Tony Blair and Michael Gove have made the issue a political priority.</p> <p>The recent fall in adoption is associated with a 2013 court ruling made by Sir James Munby, president of the Family Division, which implied adoption is only appropriate as a last resort when \u201cnothing else will do\u201d. This has paved the way for a renewed reluctance by the courts to approve adoption orders, despite guidance that has since been issued to make clear this ruling did not constitute a change in law.

  "<p>Amid the waves of moral outrage that followed the professional demise of Sam Allardyce, there was very little appreciation of the real reason why he had to be<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/27/sam-allardyce-leaves-england-manager-role-fa\"> removed from his post as manager of the English national football team</a>. Allardyce may have displayed an unseemly enthusiasm for the financial blandishments of the people purporting to be a football agency firm but greed was not the crucial factor here.</p> <p>A curious reaction to Allardyce\u2019s sacking has been apparent since the <em>Daily Telegraph</em> \u201cstung\u201d him. Those who daily dispense street wisdom on these sorts of things all shook their heads ruefully and shouted \u201cgreed\u201d in a way that made you think they had never been guilty of this, the most commonly practised of the seven deadly sins. Many of them follow clubs that have spent inordinate amounts on unremarkable footballers whose stated goal in life is to make as much money as possible out of the short and brutally unforgiving stretch of their playing careers.</p> <p>Yet it would be wrong also to accuse these mendicant, latterday Merlins of being avaricious in their dealings with the game that has made them rich. Football is still largely a game supported by working-class men and women and it is still largely from these communities that the overwhelming majority of professional footballers will emerge. The young men who have been blessed with the ability to play this game with an extraordinarily high level of skill quickly realise that they have been given one of life\u2019s golden tickets.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/28/celtic-manchester-city-champions-league-match-report\">Celtic end Manchester City\u2019s winning run with thrilling Champions League draw</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Within a short period of being discovered, they will understand that an assortment of sharp-suited Fagins and corporate money-changers has hitched their wagons to \u201cthe People\u2019s Game\u201d for the singular purpose of making money from it. From time to time, global sponsors will appoint brand ambassadors and chirrup some nonsense about supporting football in the community but whatever scraps they throw to the urchins are swamped by the eye-watering profits they extract from their association with the game.</p> <p>They will hear dressing-room tales, handed down through each succeeding generation of footballers, of how good, honest professionals were preyed upon and then cheated out of their money by businessmen who stuck in at school while their victims were getting stuck in at endless youth coaching sessions. Most of them will also know that football clubs seem beholden to nothing that resembles employment law and have all the social responsibility of Victorian mill-owners.</p> <p>Footballers exist to be trained to the point of exhaustion; to be exploited for the few brief years when they shine and thence to be discarded as abruptly as a lame horse. I can\u2019t think of any workers more entitled to grab as much as they can while they are still considered sufficiently fit to do so.</p> <p>Managers are footballers who either survived the system or had the fortitude to recognise early in their careers that, though they might not be good enough to make life-changing quantums of money, they could make a decent living beyond their playing days in coaching. They too know that their job security is on a parallel with that of a diversity consultant in Texas. They will never be more than a few months away from being sacked by the puce-faced scion of the local butcher\u2019s firm.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The loyalty of fans to their chosen club eclipses almost all other fealties in the course of our lives</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>So, let\u2019s not get all puritanical and censorious about what might have motivated Big Sam to maximise his earnings during what would inevitably have been a short and chaotic stewardship of the world\u2019s favourite underperforming national football team.</p> <p>Yet Allardyce had to go. By expressing his contempt for FA rules on third-party ownership, he was breaking perhaps the last innocent contract that exists between football supporters and the game that we love. The loyalty of fans to their chosen club eclipses almost all other fealties in the course of our lives. As such, we are eternally vulnerable to the predations of big business and the chisellers who follow in their wake. Our lot as fans is to be festooned with overpriced merchandise, swollen ticket prices and huckster airlines that hike air fares whenever a British team is drawn to play in Europe.</p> <p>The supporters, though, accept all this and understand that it will always be a part of the game. We all choose to look the other way in exchange for two things: that the players give everything of themselves on the pitch and that they all belong wholly to the club that purchased them on our behalf and with our money. We have a not unreasonable expectation that wee Alfredo Sivori is not also part-owned by a dodgy consortium concerned in the supply of rocket-launchers to the Assad regime.</p> <p>At <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/28/celtic-manchester-city-champions-league-match-report\">Celtic Park last Wednesday night, </a>I watched something extraordinary unfold that was more important than seeing my team go toe to toe with the most expensively assembled squad in the history of British football and emerge unbowed. I observed a communion between supporters and team that helped their exhausted players reach the finishing line and stumble over it. And I saw Manchester City players forget about the millions in their bank accounts, roll up their sleeves in the driving Glasgow rain and respond by playing with the passion and desire of their childhoods.</p> <p>The supporters were rewarded with a game that did not feature any bookings and in which the players of each side did not try to con the referee or induce him to dismiss opponents by feigning injury.</p> <p>Later that same evening, I was invited to discuss the Sam Allardyce affair on STV with Nick Hilton, the <em>Spectator</em> writer. Hilton, at one point, seemed to be suggesting that football fans are largely ignorant of the sophisticated financial arrangements that govern Big Football. He was wrong, for we know full well that wherever money chooses to reside corruption and larceny will follow it.</p> <p>But every once in a while, an encounter like Celtic v Manchester City comes along and we remember again why we love this game.</p>",
  "<p>This was meant to be <em>Vogue</em>\u2019s year. The British version of the magazine turned 100, resulting in, among other celebratory goings-on, an exhibition at London\u2019s National Portrait Gallery, <a href=\"http://www.npg.org.uk/whatson/vogue/exhibition.php\">Vogue 100: A Century of Style</a>, telling the story of one of the world\u2019s most influential magazines. But a turn of events, and the social media reaction, threw a stiletto at the brand\u2019s well-manicured public appearance and demonstrated very publicly an insurgency that is under way next to the catwalk.</p> <p>During a round-table discussion about Milan fashion week, editors on <em>Vogue</em>\u2019s American edition gave their views on style bloggers, and it was damning. Questioning the street-style business model of wearing paid-for brand placements, they used descriptors like \u201cdesperate\u201d and said it \u201cherald(ed) the death of style\u201d. In response, style blogger Susie Bubble tweeted: \u201cThe fashion establishment don\u2019t want their circles enlarged and for the ivory tower to remain just that. Towering and impenetrable.\u201d</p> <p>The incident highlighted how the ground beneath the establishment\u2019s feet has shifted this season. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/sep/24/burberry-reinvent-retail-from-catwalk-to-checkout-see-now-buy-now\">See-now-buy-now</a> and genderless catwalks have reflected economic and social shifts towards a younger mindset, while Bubble\u2019s point about enlarging circles could equally read as a comment on what\u2019s been happening on the front row (the \u201cFrow\u201d) in this summer\u2019s global fashion shows.</p> <p>Traditionally the place where old Hollywood glamour mixed with fashion journalism, the Frow has shifted its allegiances, actively courting a younger and more social media-savvy crowd. Dolce &amp; Gabbana\u2019s Milan fashion week show was an extreme example of this. It saw the fashion house fly in a range of millennial celebrities, such as Cameron Dallas, Lily-Rose Depp, Lucky Blue Smith and Rafferty Law, to sit in pride of place. The Frow resembled a particularly large group selfie, where mainstream media journalists were relegated to the second row.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the kitschy, high-energy presentation featured street dancers, model Hailey Baldwin and a pre-show soundtrack of Justin Bieber, pointed attempts to capture not just hearts and minds but the smartphone\u2019s lens too. As the show came to a close, exiting fashionistas, such as Anna Wintour, were met by swarms of pre-pubescent girls screaming not for her but for the heart-throbs they follow on Vine or Instagram. It was Beatlemania for Generation Z.</p> <p>Backstage before the show, Stefano Gabbana admitted that the label was trying to appeal to a younger market. \u201cWe looked at the millennials [for inspiration],\u201d he said. \u201cEveryone wants to be young.\u201d</p> <p>The appeal to fashion labels is clear: a Frow full of social media-savvy celebs creates publicity and generates sales. \u201cVloggers, Viners and Instagram celebs almost exist for endorsements,\u201d says Malcolm Mackenzie, editor of <em>We Love Pop</em> magazine. \u201cThey don\u2019t have a day job, like shooting a movie, to get in the way of self-promotion, because self-promotion <em>is</em> their day job.\u201d</p> <p>But arranging the seating plan of the Frow can be a tricky jigsaw to solve. \u201cMy feeling is that it\u2019s always a balance \u2013 you want heavy-hitter celebrities, but the editors are just as vital with huge followings, too,\u201d says Mandi Lennard, fashion PR and consultant. \u201cIt\u2019s a delicate balance, as you don\u2019t want to make an editor feel neglected.\u201d</p> <p>But perhaps editors just need to adapt to the times: 2016 has seen the fashion industry focus on young celebrities who fit the Hailey Baldwin template: heritage names with large social media followings. \u201cStars like Dallas have a direct line to millions of fans who avidly watch everything they do, so it\u2019s a no-brainer for business to want in on the action,\u201d says Mackenzie.

  "<p>James Harding points to four examples of how the BBC challenged politicians to justify his claim that the broadcaster did a good job during the referendum campaign (\u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/24/dont-blame-bbc-for-brexit-false-balance\" title=\"\">A truly balanced view from the BBC: don\u2019t blame us for Brexit\u201d</a>, Comment). There were, indeed, some cases in its thousands of hours of coverage when journalists grilled their interviewees effectively, but there were many times when they didn\u2019t.</p> <p>I paid special attention to its agenda-setting <em>Today</em> programme in the early period of the campaign and noted many cases of inadequate challenge. For example, it let Andrea Leadsom say falsely that we send \u00a3350m a week to the European Union on 8 March and Gisela Stuart say the same on 15 April. During that interview, the Vote Leave chair also promised to use the money for the NHS. As late as 11 May, <em>Today</em> allowed Boris Johnson to say we are sending the EU \u00a320bn a year.</p> <p>Other failures included letting interviewees spread the myth that the European Union needs us more than we need them. Chris Grayling said this on 10 March, without being adequately challenged, as did John Redwood on 22 March. Meanwhile, on 24 March, David Davis was allowed to get away with saying we can\u2019t stop killers with EU passports coming to the UK when we can.</p> <p>These examples could be dismissed as anecdotal. Given how the BBC dominates our news coverage, there should be an independent audit of how it fared during the referendum, backed up by recommendations of how to do better in future.<br><strong>Hugo Dixon</strong><br>Chairman and editor-in-chief, InFacts<br>London</p> <p>The BBC is valued for taking its duty of impartiality between opinions seriously. It does not have a duty of impartiality between facts and lies; indeed, it has a duty to expose clear falsehoods.</p> <p>The core of the BBC\u2019s Brexit referendum failing was that it allowed itself to be taken for a ride in allowing the \u00a3350m a week lie to be presented as a matter of opinion and given credence by continuous repetition.</p> <p>James Harding points out that Evan Davis challenged that lie but the BBC\u2019s duty with respect to a transparent falsehood is to state that it is false each time it is repeated.<br><strong>Colin Garwood</strong><br>Berkhamsted</p> <p>James Harding\u2019s view of the Brexit debate didn\u2019t reflect mine or that of my friends. We all thought too many times journalists rarely challenged lies and constantly brought on opposing opinion from less credible sources just for the sake of balance. No wonder people were confused.</p> <p>To balance a credible source, why does the BBC <em>still</em> roll out people such as Nigel Lawson (who have no up-to-date expertise and a proved history of inaccurate anti-climate change evidence)? As for experts, they are no longer credible, it seems; they were openly disregarded by Michael Gove, a position rarely ridiculed by BBC.</p> <p>Challenging speakers requires background research and it looks as if the BBC can no longer afford this. <br><strong>CM Retallack</strong><br>Tywardreath, Cornwall<br></p> <p>For the moment, let\u2019s accept that James Harding\u2019s defence of the referendum coverage is valid: a balance between the Leave and Remain proponents. But what he has failed to recognise was the focus of the coverage (a failure of the majority of the media). Alan Johnson was supposed to lead the Labour campaign to stay in the EU, but not once did I see or hear of this reported by the BBC, nor was I aware of coverage of Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s meetings around the country.</p> <p>Why? Because the BBC became fixated on the so-called blue on blue contest between David Cameron and Boris Johnson. Perhaps the anodyne Cameron versus the tomfoolery of Johnson was perceived more interesting than other more serious debate.<br><strong>George Hudson</strong><br>Worcester</p>",
  "<p>The singer Katy Perry, a Hillary Clinton supporter, has produced a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSd-3Yc1N3s\" title=\"\">\u201cVoting naked\u201d video</a>, urging people to vote in the US election. Madonna responded with her own \u201cVoting naked\u201d photo on Instagram, showing her bare shoulders, also urging people to back Clinton, saying that women need to support each other. \u201cWomen Run The World now \u2013 they have to get out and start supporting one another. No more misogynist feminists! No more misogony [sic]. Get out and vote,\u201d wrote Madonna, with good intentions, albeit bad spelling.</p> <p>The image was later deleted, along with the one where Madonna had photoshopped Clinton between her legs. (Stay classy, Ms Ciccone!) Both singers\u2019 efforts did the job by causing a media flurry. Were their actions successful in a deeper feminist way? In my view, quite the opposite.</p> <p>It\u2019s obvious what they were trying to do; in fact, Perry says that her whole aim was to be click-bait. In fairness, Perry\u2019s video is ditsy-humorous rather than sexualised. Her breasts and genitals are blanked out with dark, modesty-style strips; her hair is styled as a rat\u2019s nest with lollipops sticking out of it. While it was still up, Madonna\u2019s image merely gave the impression of nudity.</p> <p>They\u2019re not the first to use nudity to raise awareness. (Famously, there was the Peta campaign \u201c<a href=\"http://www.peta.org/videos/id-rather-go-naked-than-wear-fur/\" title=\"\">I\u2019d rather go naked than wear fur</a>\u201d, featuring various supermodels, one of whom, Naomi Campbell, went on to rather let the side down, by, you guessed it, wearing fur.) Moreover, they were doing it for a \u201cgood cause\u201d, not out of a sense of the now-routine monetised, sexualised exhibitionism. (I don\u2019t know about you lot, but, as a heterosexual woman, I\u2019m officially bored with Kim Kardashian\u2019s constant updates on the state of her tits and arse.) Compared with that, it\u2019s pretty cool that Madonna supported Perry supporting Clinton.</p> <p>However, there\u2019s something worrying, something distinctly non-feminist about these \u201cnaked voting\u201d efforts. In that, with the semi-exception of the actor Mark Ruffalo, a fellow Clinton supporter (who\u2019d previously <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/sep/22/robert-downey-jnr-offers-up-a-naked-mark-ruffalo-to-enocurage-americans-to-vote-video\" title=\"\">jokingly promised to go naked</a> in his next film), there were no prominent males opting for the nudity-equals-attention option.</p> <p>There were no equivalent men running around butt-naked with modesty strips and lollipops stuck in their hair or provocatively leaning their bare shoulders into the camera lens. So why did these incredibly famous, successful women do it?</p> <p>To an extent, where\u2019s the harm? This is an era where revenge porn verges on an epidemic and there have been wretched attempts to shame celebrities with their own stolen explicit images. It\u2019s arguable that by exploiting their own nudity, Madonna and Perry are subverting the global sexualisation of women.</p> <p>The logic here is that there\u2019s a constant scrabble to look at famous women naked, to reduce them and all other women to body parts. Well, these famous women can play this game on their own terms and you\u2019ll listen to their message too.</p> <p>At which point, the argument frays and disintegrates. If a woman feels that the only way she can command attention is by taking her clothes off, then her \u201cmessage\u201d is a scream lost in a&#xa0;hurricane.</p> <p>However good the cause, it doesn\u2019t make up for the core rationale that the quickest, easiest way for a woman to get attention is to disrobe. Men simply don\u2019t feel that they have to behave this way \u2013 they think the quickest, easiest way to get attention is to open their mouths.</p> <p>The fact that both these successful women performed their well-intentioned \u201cethical\u201d striptease on behalf of a female candidate just makes it seem even more skewed and desperate.</p> <p>If, among other things, Clinton is fighting for respect for women beyond their worth (or lack of it) as sexual/post-sexual objects, then I\u2019d wager that the very last thing she needs is for even her supporters to peddle sex.</p> <h2>Foxhunting?

An Ipsos Mori poll says that any attempt to <a href=\"http://www.itv.com/news/2016-09-30/hunting-ban-supported-by-84-of-voters/\" title=\"\">repeal the Hunting Act</a> would be \u201cdeeply unpopular\u201d with 84% of the British public. The poll was commissioned by the League Against Cruel Sports, which could hardly claim no bias, but the findings are clear enough. There was also huge opposition to hare coursing (91%) and deer hunting (88%).</p> <p>So by a huge majority, the British public would prefer that the hunting ban stay in place. Who\u2019d have thought it? Well, actually, most people would. Common sense dictates that the only people who oppose the hunting ban are the relatively small number who hunt. Normal people are unlikely to say: \u201cWell, I don\u2019t hunt myself, but I still feel very strongly that they should repeal the law banning the practice of live animals being chased and ripped to pieces by hounds, pursued by horse riders in fancy dress costume.\u201d</p> <p>However much the pro-hunt lobby tries to frame this as an issue of personal freedom, most people are quite rightly repulsed by the idea of animals being made to suffer and die for what is&#xa0;effectively just a niche sporting pursuit. In 2016, the vermin control argument is also becoming silly. There are quite a few urban foxes these days. Should we start insisting that competitive cyclists chase them around the streets, followed by packs of braying hounds? Perhaps skateboarders could join in?</p> <p>Polls such as this make a mockery of environment secretary Andrea Leadsom saying that she intends to take a \u201cfresh look\u201d at the foxhunting ban. Here\u2019s your fresh look, Ms Leadsom \u2013 84% against, and not likely to go down much in the near future.</p> <h2>Sooty and Soo: greatest glove story ever told?</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"83ea8d90bb3d8df94cbd4fb5bc5bdef330e68660\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/83ea8d90bb3d8df94cbd4fb5bc5bdef330e68660/248_730_3891_2335/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Matthew Corbett with Sooty, Sweep and Soo.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Matthew Corbett with Sooty, Sweep and Soo.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: FremantleMedia Ltd / Rex Feature</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Readers of a delicate disposition, please look away now \u2013 there is news of a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2015/jan/13/sooty-bbc-television-harry-corbett\" title=\"\">Sooty</a>-themed sex scandal. In the 1960s, there was a row when Sooty\u2019s creator, the late Harry Corbett, suggested Sooty should have a girlfriend, Soo. Some people, including the show\u2019s producer and a BBC governor, were scandalised, saying it would \u201cintroduce sex into a children\u2019s programme\u201d. The issue generated so much controversy the director general, Hugh Carleton Greene, had to intervene.</p> <p>All of which has been revealed by Corbett\u2019s son and Sooty-heir, Matthew, in the documentary, <em>Sooty Ungloved</em>, which just enjoyed its, ahem, \u201cworld premiere\u201d in Guiseley, West Yorkshire, where the Corbett family lived for 35 years. I\u2019ve yet to see <em>Sooty Ungloved</em>, but I\u2019m imagining a Watergate-vibe, featuring Sweep interviewed with his face in semi-darkness.</p> <p>In the end, the DG ruled Sooty could have Soo, but that the puppets must \u201cnever touch\u201d (what sordid practices was Carleton Greene envisaging?). What a wonderful story, amusing, but also a bittersweet comment on the lost innocence of a nation.

  "<p>When you\u2019re at a British airport, do you ever reflect to yourself that the experience simply isn\u2019t irritating enough? As you climb out of your shoes and stand, shy and barefoot, on a grimy concourse, do you think: \u201cThey could do more to wind me up\u201d?</p> <p>As you laboriously decant asthma inhalers and contact-lens solution into a clear plastic bag, do you think: \u201cThey could do more\u201d?</p> <p>As you throw a half-full bottle of apple juice in a bin, do you think: \u201cThey could do more\u201d?</p> <p>As a haughty help-desk attendant delights in informing you that no, of course there is no \u201csmoking lounge\u201d because why should the flawless authori-bots who make the rules leave room for human weakness, do you think: \u201cThey could do more\u201d?</p> <p>As you watch an embarrassed old lady forced to empty her entire hand luggage in front of an unsmiling official as a \u201cterror check\u201d triggered by her forgetting to remove a lipstick from an outside pocket, do you think: \u201cThey could do more\u201d?</p> <p>As you get on to the plane and sit for two hours on the tarmac because, although you bought your ticket nine months ago, the scheduled departure seems to have come as a surprise to air traffic control who haven\u2019t given it a slot, do you think: \u201cThey could do more\u201d?</p> <p>As you wait and wait and wait and wait under a sign in the baggage hall that doesn\u2019t even tell you which carousel your suitcase will be coming to, never mind when it\u2019s coming, do you think: \u201cThey could do more\u201d?</p> <p>Well, good news! They\u2019re doing more.</p> <p>The Home Office has confirmed that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/sep/11/travellers-face-5-charge-to-get-through-passport-control-more-quickly\" title=\"\">travellers are to be charged up to \u00a317.50 to \u201cfast-track\u201d through passport control</a> when they arrive at British airports. So you will soon have the opportunity either to pay a fee in order to fulfil the legal requirement of showing your passport, or not pay it and watch other people walk ahead of you into your own country purely by virtue of being richer. All animals are equal but some are more equal than others, I guess.</p> <p>This is disgusting \u2013 and I say that as someone who\u2019s happy to throw money around at airports. And that\u2019s \u201cthrow\u201d like Fatima Whitbread threw the javelin.</p> <p>In 2006, when I won first prize in a poker tournament (the kind of money that one is traditionally meant to spend on cars, coke and hookers), I horrified fellow gamblers by paying off my mortgage. I also joined a gym, which was marginally more expensive than paying off the mortgage, but there was still a bit of money left. With this, I decided to create a \u201cfirst-class flight fund\u201d.</p> <p>That was my crazy act of self-indulgence; where other people might have bought a Ferrari or had their boobs done, I ringfenced a bankroll solely for the purpose of first-class air travel. Discovering in later years that a) business class is cheaper but often nicer than first, and b) once you start buying expensive flights, they give you enough air miles to get lots of free ones anyway, I haven\u2019t flown economy since.</p> <p>The reason I chose that particular splurge is I\u2019m absolutely terrified of flying. I don\u2019t mean nervous. I don\u2019t mean jumpy. I mean sobbing as the plane taxis down the runway. I mean strangers offering to hold my hand. I mean people 10 rows behind going: \u201cIs that the woman from <em>Have I Got News For You</em>, shouting the Lord\u2019s Prayer at the drinks trolley?\u201d</p> <p>Travelling business class helps \u2013 not in the sense of taking the edge off with creature comforts, because I\u2019m too scared to enjoy them, but because it means you\u2019re very near the cabin crew. They are nearly always good at reassurance and will often let you speak to the pilot before takeoff.</p> <p>Look at it another way: when I\u2019m at an airport, I\u2019ve usually spent the best part of three grand on a reclining seat and metal cutlery. Plus, I genuinely think I\u2019m about to die. So, trust me, I am not slow to put my hand in my pocket.</p> <p>I have no problem with most of the perks that come with this ludicrous extravagance. I\u2019m happy to use a special, queue-free \u201cbag drop\u201d. I\u2019ve got no guilt about being allowed an extra piece of hand luggage, or knowing I\u2019ll definitely get the nice meal rather than the inexplicably horrible second choice they offer (by row 47, it\u2019s always: \u201cI\u2019m afraid the roast chicken is now finished but we <em>do</em> have plenty of the beetroot and bison-sperm salad\u2026\u201d).</p> <p>I\u2019m fine with all that. It\u2019s a fair fight; I get a mouthful of chicken and an extra bag of magazines, economy passengers get the comfort of knowing they haven\u2019t pissed thousands of pounds up the wall on basically nothing. All of the really annoying stuff \u2013 the stuff I listed at the beginning \u2013 still happens if you fly first class. That\u2019s why the super-rich get their own planes.</p> <p>Certainly, the experience of coming into the country is the same. And so it bloody should be. A UK passport-holder returning to her home country should be welcomed back: not sneered at, not treated with unwonted suspicion, and certainly not made to wait while someone else pays to skip ahead. Don\u2019t get me wrong; if they bring in the fast track, I\u2019ll pay the money and do it, but I don\u2019t want to be allowed to.</p> <p>This is a huge symbolic moment. If this goes ahead, we are openly saying that it\u2019s OK to pay a public servant for preferential treatment. It\u2019s not even secret bribery, it\u2019s state-approved favouritism.</p> <p>And of all public servants, a border guard! That\u2019s like your mum giving your brother his Christmas dinner ahead of you because he earns more money. It mustn\u2019t work like that. Coming home is coming home.</p>",
  "<p>\u2018Every journalist has a novel inside him, which is an excellent place for it,\u201d the American art historian Russell Lynes once observed. Indeed, each week, the in-trays of publishing agents are inundated with scores of novels from newspaper hacks who believe they can make the jump to fiction. But history suggests Lynes was right.</p> <p>The list of journalists who make the leap successfully \u2013 enough, say, to give up the day job \u2013 is not long. For every Robert Harris or Sebastian Faulks, there\u2019s a dozen who will fail to make much of an impact. Take Amy Silver, for example. The author of a clutch of a romcom novels with inoffensive titles such as <em>The Reunion</em>, <em>One Minute to Midnight</em> and <em>All I want for Christmas</em> enjoyed a decent following but not one that would have her agent eyeing up a second home in Tuscany.</p> <p>But what happened when her fourth novel failed to take off has now entered literary legend and given more than ample succour to any journalist wishing to defy Lynes\u2019s maxim.</p> <p>Paula Hawkins, a former personal finance journalist on the <em>Times</em> and the <em>European</em>, who wrote under the Silver pseudonym, decided to retire the author and strike out under her own name exploring themes that were far darker than those of her first novel, <em>Confessions of a Reluctant Recessionista</em>.</p> <p>Perhaps she was bored with romcom. Perhaps she was just always that way inclined. \u201cI like bad weather,\u201d she has said. \u201cIt suits my mood.\u201d</p> <p>Short of money, Hawkins fired off 30,000 words, the genesis of a book that became <em>The Girl on the Train</em>, now turned into a film by Steven Spielberg\u2019s DreamWorks studio, starring Emily Blunt. Hawkins\u2019s agent was bowled over by what she had written but the author was not convinced. \u201cShe kept saying it was going to be good, but it was one of those things when you\u2019re not sure; it\u2019s like your mum telling you you\u2019re pretty,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/apr/29/paula-hawkins-woman-behind-the-girl-on-the-train-interview\">Hawkins told the <em>Guardian</em></a>.</p> <p>That interview was in April, only 16 months after the book first hit the shelves. Since then, <em>TGOTT</em> has sold, according to a <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/natalierobehmed/2016/08/03/paula-hawkins-joins-highest-paid-authors-ranking-with-the-girl-on-the-train/#4db8d8ebab05\"><em>Forbes </em>estimate</a> in August, more than 15m copies, catapulting Hawkins into last year\u2019s top 10 highest-earning authors.</p> <p>Transworld, the publisher, had initially ordered a print run of 12,000 copies in the UK. Certainly, the book\u2019s outline would have given little clue as to its potential \u2013 the tale of a lonely alcoholic, Rachel, who has lost her job, but who, for the sake of appearances, continues her daily train commute. Few would have predicted it would go on to become <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/aug/25/the-girl-on-the-train-tops-amazons-uk-ebook-sales-this-year-so-far\">Amazon\u2019s bestselling book of 2015</a>.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkoEE1i0CX8\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/KkoEE1i0CX8?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>Watch the trailer for The Girl on the Train.</figcaption> </figure>   <p>It is tempting, for the sake of an easy narrative, to suggest that Hawkins\u2019s success was achieved almost accidentally. She was clearly taken aback by the sheer scale of the book\u2019s success. \u201cYou can tell when there\u2019s going to be a good response, but you can never really tell when something is going to become so huge,\u201d <a href=\"http://www.standard.co.uk/lifestyle/london-life/runaway-success-paula-hawkins-author-of-the-girl-on-the-train-portraits-by-pal-hansen-10133029.html\">she told the <em>Evening Standard</em></a>. \u201cThere\u2019s an alchemy to it that I don\u2019t quite understand.\u201d</p> <p>Transworld launched a campaign around the book at the Harrogate Crime Writing Festival in July 2014, six months before publication, with proof copies targeted at key figures in the book world. Riverhead, the US publisher, was similarly shrewd in its marketing. The Amazon-owned Goodreads website notes how some 4,000 advance reader copies were sent out to booksellers, readers and critics to build a buzz around the title long before it hit the shelves.</p> <p>Such initiatives are not unusual although the scale of the distribution \u2013 and its targeting \u2013 was much more sophisticated than most campaigns. One person who received the book was Stephen King who tweeted that it had \u201ckept [him] up most of the night. The alcoholic narrator is dead perfect.\u201d</p> <p>As word travelled, the buzz became a roar on social media \u2013 Reese Witherspoon posted an Instagram of herself reading the book \u2013 and pre-orders from booksellers started piling in. <br></p> <p>Published in January, a quiet month when publishing houses blood new authors before established writers bring out their summer or autumn novels, <em>TGOTT</em> benefited from some early favourable reviews.</p> <p>Hawkins, for years the one asking the questions, suddenly found herself on the receiving end of interviews and the subject of huge media attention, something that made her feel uncomfortable. \u201cI\u2019d been worrying for so long about my financial situation, what I was doing with my life, so I felt relief, then fear, with the realisation that when something starts to do very well, lots of people are going to read it and that makes you feel really quite vulnerable,\u201d she explained.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Rachel is also conventionally, aspirationally suburban, a peculiarly British type of character perhaps</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>It helped that Hawkins had written a book that was bang on trend. Rachel\u2019s unreliable narrator drew comparisons with Gillian Flynn\u2019s blockbuster <em>Gone Girl </em>that had come out a couple of years before and demonstrated that there was a huge demand for dark psychological thrillers with strong, complex female characters.</p> <p>Hawkins, who was born in Zimbabwe but grew up in the UK and studied politics, philosophy and economics at Keble College, Oxford, acknowledges why people bracket her with Flynn. \u201cThere\u2019s something about that highly flawed, messed-up female protagonist that people seem to like at the moment,\u201d she said.</p> <p>But in interviews she also gives the impression that she feels the comparisons are sometimes overdone. True, both have a missing woman at their heart and paint in claustrophobic detail portraits of disintegrating marriages. But whereas Flynn\u2019s character, Amy Dunne, is menacing, powerful, manipulative, Rachel Watson is almost the opposite. A woman with a faltering, gin-soaked memory, she is trying to do the right thing. She is pitiable and vulnerable. At one stage, in a line that has provoked much attention, Rachel acknowledges: \u201cWomen are still only valued for two things \u2013 their looks and their role as mothers. I\u2019m not beautiful and I can\u2019t have kids, so what does that make me? Worthless.\u201d</p> <p>Rachel is also conventionally, aspirationally suburban, a peculiarly British type of character perhaps. Whereas Amy has a psychopathic hatred for small-town Missouri to which she has been forced to decamp from a vibrant, intoxicating New York, Rachel has a fascination with those whose homes she passes on her daily commute. It is a fascination that many British commuters will recognise, not least Hawkins herself.</p> <p>\u201cI commuted into the centre of London every day, and I used to sit on the train,\u201d Hawkins, 44, <a href=\"http://time.com/3665837/paula-hawkins-girl-on-the-train-gone-girl/\">told <em>Time</em></a>. \u201cFor parts of the journey, I would go quite close to people\u2019s homes and I always liked that \u2013 being able to see inside people\u2019s houses and imagining what those people were like. And then I was sort of idly wondering what one would do if one saw something shocking.\u201d</p> <p>Playing around with a character\u2019s perspective is as old as the thriller itself, in book or film. One of its most celebrated exponents is Alfred Hitchcock and it is no surprise that Hawkins cites him as an influence. \u201cI was going for a slightly Hitchcock-style atmosphere,\u201d she told <em>Time</em>. \u201cI did want that feeling of paranoia, self-doubt, suspicion.\u201d Perhaps this explains the book\u2019s appeal. In Rachel we see a woman out of control. But we also see ourselves.</p> <p>Some feminist critics took issue with how Hawkins (and Flynn) depicted the abuse of women. And some readers carped that they saw the twist coming from far off. But many echoed Stephen King who tweeted, <em>TGOTT</em> is a \u201creally great suspense novel\u201d. Whether the book\u2019s millions of readers will warm to its depiction on the big screen remains to be seen. A pulchritudinous Blunt will make for an interesting Rachel. The twitching curtains of suburban London have been replaced by the river towns of upstate New York. There is, apparently, a lot more sex.</p> <p>Hawkins has had no creative control over the film, which is probably just as well as she has needed the time to polish her follow-up novel about which little is known other than it may be \u201cgothic-tinged\u201d and about sisters. Inevitably, expectation is huge. Transworld is allowing impatient readers the chance to sign up online to receive the first chapter. It\u2019s yet another confirmation of just how far Hawkins has come in such a short space of time.</p> <p><strong>Born</strong> Paula Hawkins, 28 August 1972, in Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe), before the family moved to the UK. Studied politics, philosophy and economics at Oxford, and worked as a personal finance journalist for the <em>Times</em>.</p> <p><strong>Best of times</strong> This August, she entered the <em>Forbes</em> top 10 highest-earning authors on the strength of the first novel written under her own name, <em>The Girl on the Train</em>.</p> <p><strong>Worst of times</strong> A run of romantic comedy novels, written under the pseudonym Amy Silver, failed to catch fire.</p> <p><strong>What they say</strong> \u201cHawkins juggles perspectives and time scales with great skill, and considerable suspense builds up along with empathy for an unusual central character who does not immediately grab the reader.\u201d The <em>Guardian</em></p> <p>\u201cHawkins\u2019s first thriller is well-written and ingeniously constructed \u2013 perhaps a bit too ingeniously\u2026 But the portrait of Rachel as a chronic drunk who might just save herself by playing detective is memorable.\u201d</p> <p>The <em>Washington Post</em></p> <p><strong>What she says</strong> \u201cI think people have got a little bit tired of a trope of a beautiful dead woman on the first page of a novel.

Literally translated, it asks if immigrants should be sent to Hungary without parliament\u2019s approval.

To do so, his government has unleashed what research by <a href=\"http://www.transparency.org\">Transparency International</a> suggests is the largest advertising campaign in Hungarian history. Even in the countryside, voters are never far from a poster that warns: \u201cDon\u2019t put Hungary\u2019s future at risk!\u201d Of the roughly 20,000 outdoor advertising spots in the country, nearly 6,000 have been taken over by the government\u2019s campaign, TI\u2019s legal director, Mikl\u00f3s Ligeti, said. That is five times as many as the next largest, mounted by a tobacco firm in the mid-1990s.</p> <p>Big hitters such as L\u00e1z\u00e1r have been dispatched to tiny villages to make the case for voting. M\u00e1rt\u00e9ly was L\u00e1z\u00e1r\u2019s 20th. \u201cFirst it will be 1,000, then it will be 10,000, 20,000, 30,000 \u2013 if they come, it will be irreversible,\u201d he told the villagers. \u201cRegardless of who you vote for, regardless of whether you like Viktor Orb\u00e1n, this is about who will live in your village, and therefore you should vote no.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cA yes vote will force a flood of people on us \u2013 people with a poisoned tooth in their pants!\u201d yelled one of the long-bearded pensioners, a retired electrician, Tibor Antal. \u201cWhat will we do if those guys come here? We\u2019ll beat them up!\u201d</p> <p>Hungary\u2019s rights campaigners say that the referendum campaign has turned an already dark public discourse into something far worse. \u201cThe mood is quite reminiscent of the 1930s,\u201d said M\u00e1rta Pardavi, co-chair of the Hungarian Helsinki Committee rights group. Pardavi fears that stigmatisation of refugees could soon accelerate the alienation of other marginal groups in Hungary. \u201cRacism directed towards one group can easily be transferred towards other groups in society \u2013 and the seeds of this are being sown by the government through their taxpayer-funded campaign,\u201d said Pardavi. \u201cThis is what distinguishes Hungary from other European countries with hate speech \u2013 here it\u2019s the government that is funding it.\u201d</p> <p>Orb\u00e1n\u2019s critics are suspicious about the timing of the referendum.

Yes, 200,000 Hungarians sought refuge from communism in 1956, she admitted, but today\u2019s refugees are very different. \u201cThey want Hungarians to be their servants,\u201d Lugosi argued. \u201cThey think that it\u2019s the duty of Christians to serve them.\u201d</p> <p><em>Additional reporting by Benjamin Nov\u00e1k</em></p> <h2>A CRUCIAL QUESTION</h2> <p>Hungarians go to the polls on Sunday to vote on whether parliament should allow the EU to set a quota for refugee resettlement in the country. The referendum was conceived and championed by the prime minister, Viktor Orb\u00e1n.</p> <p>Voters will be asked the question \u201cAre you are in favour of the EU being allowed to make the settlement of non-Hungarians obligatory in Hungary even if the parliament does not agree?\u201d The country received the second largest number of asylum applicants in Europe last year, behind Germany. Hungary received 174,000 asylum applications (13% of Europe\u2019s asylum seekers) \u2013 but very few actually stayed. In August Orb\u00e1n announced that the country was planning to build a second fence to prevent refugees from crossing the border. It will stand next to its current 500km razor wire fence that runs alongside its border with Croatia and Serbia. Last year some 400,000 migrants crossed Hungary \u2013 fewer than 18,000 have done so in 2016.</p> <p>Until mid-June, only 2,280 people had been relocated across Europe from Greece and Italy, according to EU data.

  "<p>It is December 1956 and I am in Margate among a number of adults seated on the floor at a meeting organised for Hungarian refugees of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2006/oct/22/egypt.featuresreview\">failed uprising</a> the month before. I am only just eight and have no English, but my father, who does have some, is interpreting. A pretty English woman is about to speak when a young Hungarian puts his lighted cigarette to her stocking. She leaps up in pain. The man sniggers to his friend. The Hungarians are horrified that anyone should think they are represented by two such louts. They want them thrown out. They want to do something.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/01/hungarian-referendum-slam-door-migrants-new-era-europe\">Hungarian referendum decides whether to slam the door on migrants \u2013  and usher in a new era for Europe</a> </p> </aside>  <p>And of course the young men are not representative of the refugees, it is just that we are a mixed bunch. We don\u2019t know each other, we come from everywhere in the country. Some are old, some young, some male, some female, some professional, some manual workers. Some are freed prisoners, some may be spies. Some are just louts. And some, like me, are children. More than 200,000 Hungarians have left the country and more than 20,000 have come to Britain. That\u2019s 2% of the population. Even now there are officially about 80,000 Hungarians living in the UK and there are stories that London is the fifth \u2013 some even claim the second \u2013 largest Hungarian city.</p> <p>In 1989, more than 30 years after the uprising, I spent nine months in Hungary as a British Council scholar. We arrived in January just as the old order began to crumble. J\u00e1nos K\u00e1d\u00e1r, who took over after 1956, was no longer in charge and the man nominally in charge after him, a party official called K\u00e1roly Gr\u00f3sz, was clearly failing. Day after day, events sped dizzily on, out of the ambit of the Soviet Union, out of state socialism as it was understood, towards a condition I felt liberating.</p> <p>My friends and acquaintances were the nicest, most intelligent people. Surely there must be enough of them. The warning of my parents that Hungary was a country that could never sit straight on a horse remained with me, but I suppressed the knowledge. Hungary had produced more than its fair share of prominent people: mathematicians, film-makers, photographers, writers, economists, scientists of all sorts. Surely it would make a success of its new independence. Surely it would sit straight on a political horse of some social democratic colour.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c3a44064a8477c021c0904e76fe4914602bf2cca\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c3a44064a8477c021c0904e76fe4914602bf2cca/0_0_5302_3955/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Hungarian refugees walk towards the Austrian border at Nickelsdorf in 1956.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"746\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Hungarian refugees walk towards the Austrian border at Nickelsdorf in 1956.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Pictorial Parade/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>By 1990 Hungary had elected its first free government in a multiparty election. You could describe it as centre-right in much the same terms as you might such parties in western Europe.</p> <p>We have come a long way since. On Sunday, Hungarians are invited by the government to vote in a referendum about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2015/sep/08/uk-refugee-plan-comparison-european-countries\">migrant quotas (827 refugees for Hungary in 2015)</a> as laid down by the European Union.</p> <p>The Brexit referendum in the UK asked a very simple \u2013 far too simple \u2013 question: in or out? It got a simple answer, the complex repercussions of which are still far from clear. One effect has been a peak in verbal and physical attacks on immigrants, particularly from eastern Europe. The rhetoric leading to the decision invited hostility to foreigners and gave tacit approval to those who wanted something to kick. It was genteel approval, of course. Nobody \u201cmeant\u201d quite what has happened \u2013 they just made use of it.</p> <p>Hungary is not genteel, nor are the questions so simple. However phrased the referendum question, the rhetoric comes down to: do you want to be murdered in your beds? Do you want your town taken over by rabid Islamists? Do you want your women to be molested and raped? Do you want foreigners to take your jobs? And, of course \u2013 and here it chimes particularly well with our own referendum \u2013 do you want bureaucrats in Brussels telling you, the proud (Hungarian/British) people, what to do?</p> <p>The government desperately needs at least a 50% turnout so it can confront the EU with the \u201cwill of the people\u201d. It also needs the EU\u2019s money, of course, but of that it does not speak.</p> <p>The \u201cpeople\u201d question hasn\u2019t just arisen. It has been carefully nurtured by Viktor Orb\u00e1n and his Fidesz party ever since they came to power in a landslide in 2010. That landslide enabled them to change the constitution in several crucial ways. It enabled Fidesz to fill public and semi-public offices with its own people. It has allowed Orb\u00e1n to restrict opposition by economic means, by strangling it. Its patriotic flavour was confirmed by its support for a clearly patriotic National Academy as opposed to the financially starved academy that actually represented the finest artists, writers, musicians and architects. It has waged a cultural war on what it considers to be internationalist, liberal, unpatriotic (often a codeword for \u201cJewish\u201d) filth. It has allowed the government to control the narrative about Hungary\u2019s role in the second world war, the Holocaust and its consequences. It has allowed the far right to reclaim its heroes as public figures. It has controlled the school syllabus. It has, in the process, allowed Fidesz grandees vastly to enrich themselves.</p> <p>There is clearly a project here that is not aimed solely at Europe but at Hungarians themselves. When the migrants and refugees first began to arrive, the government put up vast billboards declaring \u201cYou can\u2019t take Hungarian jobs\u201d. In Hungarian, of course, so no migrant could ever read it.</p> <p>That \u201cyou\u201d was a dog whistle to something in the Hungarian spirit, something that is available through its linguistic isolation and its wounded history. Pick at the wound, emphasise the splendour of the isolation. At the same time make overtures to Vladimir Putin. Look to establish a power base with other old iron curtain countries. Form a bloc to challenge the \u201cdecadent\u201d and \u201cdoomed\u201d liberal west.</p> <p>Let Orb\u00e1n be the leader of that bloc. He\u2019ll make one speech on the international forum and another in Hungarian for domestic consumption. By persuasion and force let him establish his illiberal democracy, ideally without a valid opposition. Why should he not be around as long as Putin? If you have control of the constitution you can do what you like.</p> <p>Now we have the barbed-wire fences, the vigilantes, the hate speech and the populist blend of flattery and demand: the customary far-right appeal to the tribe. Jobbik, the party to the right of Fidesz, is essentially a Hungarian Mosleyite pressure group in civvies. So far.</p> <p>There are natural fears, not all unfounded, about a sudden tide of foreign people, and in the light of violent events around Europe it is easy to amplify them. The liberal failure has been to ignore them entirely. The fears are there to be addressed. Those who fear should be convinced, not dismissed as racist rabble. The rabble is what they could become and are becoming.</p> <p>We were not all heroic freedom fighters in 1956. We were a miscellaneous bunch of resourceless people flung this way and that by history. The crowd of refugees and migrants I saw gathered last summer at the eastern rail terminus in Budapest included many young families, tired and sleeping very rough after a dangerous journey that had proved fatal for some. There might have been an agent or two among them. There may also have been a few louts willing to put out a burning cigarette on a woman\u2019s leg. But no. That is not what we were. How could we be? We were Hungarians.</p>",

  "<p>Four strawberries, picked an hour earlier, sit on a saucer on the dining-room table of Lindsey Lodge Farm, a 40-acre farm growing fruit and vegetables in Suffolk. It is June and these strawberries are the first of the English season. Andrew Sturgeon, a farmer for 30 years, smiles, certain of the quality. The aroma is heady, the taste is of strawberries as they ought to be, naturally sweet. </p> <p>Sturgeon delivers to 45 stores belonging to the East of England Co-operative, owned by its members. It is independent from the Co-operative Group chain and has more than 200 shops in Essex, Suffolk and Norfolk. Ninety per cent of Sturgeon\u2019s fruit is delivered straight to stores within 36 hours of being picked. They sell at \u00a32.25 a punnet, compared with under \u00a32 elsewhere. \u201cCustomers know what they are buying when they ask for our strawberries,\u201d he says.</p> <p>According to a <a href=\"http://www.eastofengland.coop/food/sourced-locally\">recent YouGov poll</a>, 71% of UK shoppers say that buying local produce is important, yet it makes up only a fraction of the retail efforts of the four major supermarkets \u2013 Tesco, Asda, Morrisons and Sainsbury\u2019s, which <a href=\"http://www.retailthinktank.co.uk/whitepaper/the-future-of-the-grocery-sector-in-the-uk/\">dominate 75% of the market,</a> providing ever cheaper food to more than 25 million households. </p> <p>In Felixstowe, in a supermarket converted from a Victorian railway station, Roger Grosvenor, the East of England Co-op\u2019s joint chief executive, explains how the locally sourced drive began nine years ago. \u201cI was driving past fields of asparagus on a visit to a farmer near Aldeburgh when it hit me,\u201d he says. \u201cWhy are we importing asparagus from Peru, when it\u2019s all here?\u201d Sourced Locally was born. </p> <p>It still makes up only 6% of sales, but \u00a345m has been ploughed back into the local economy, creating more than 400 jobs. Labels on products show images of real farmers and producers; provenance is detailed. The food is \u201chonest\u201d. Thousands of locally sourced products come from<strong> </strong>more than 100 suppliers, including exotic items: Suffolk chorizo and chilli sauce from Colchester.</p> <p>Sales have risen 15% in the last financial year. \u201cWe don\u2019t have contracts, everything is on a handshake,\u201d Sourced Locally manager Kevin Warden says.</p> <p>\u201cWhen Kevin first came to see me,\u201d Sturgeon recalls, \u201che said, \u2018What price do you want for your strawberries?\u2019 Nobody had asked me that in 20 years supplying fruit. Other retailers say, \u201cThis is the price we are prepared to pay and then they announce they want double on a promotion at the end of a season when little is left.\u201d</p> <p>Locally sourced food, like Fair Trade or organic produce, is a small but fast growing market. Its popularity flags up that some consumers want to know more about what they buy and the terms on which those goods are delivered to the shelves of their supermarket \u2013store or farm shop including distance travelled, freshness, animal welfare and pricing. It\u2019s a simple story, but increasingly hard to unearth.</p> <p>The major supermarkets serve 25 million households (and are chafing because their profits have faltered recently as discounters Aldi and Lidl continue to thrive). We customers expect cheap food. But cheap food is often heavily processed, full of sugar and fat that plays its part in the obesity crisis we face; it requires animals permanently indoors, \u201cno grazing\u201d eating grain that produces nutritionally poorer meat; and it means the major chains source their produce from around the world, branding products to keep the memory of the British countryside alive, no matter how many air miles are involved. Cheap food also results in British farmers, bruised by the full force of a competitive global market, being increasingly squeezed by the demands of major suppliers for the perfect product and ever lower prices.</p> <p>At the same time, more and more intensive methods are being devised to extract crops from exhausted soil. These are not the ingredients that ensure sustainable, honest food.</p> <p>\u201cCheaper food is obviously welcome but there has to be a balance,\u201d says Matthew Rymer, who comes from seven generations of Gloucestershire farmers. \u201cWhat\u2019s not currently calculated is the hidden cost of what\u2019s on our plates. Too often, major retailers create the price storms that drown the smaller farmers and leave the others floating on subsidies. We are also losing our independent local food processing infrastructure as large retailers and processors contort the food chain and gain more and more retail power.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1d7ade937f8f034dd1c0a569fe4fdd39b0b83593\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1d7ade937f8f034dd1c0a569fe4fdd39b0b83593/0_302_4032_2419/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Matthew Rymer of #namethefarm campaign\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Matthew Rymer of #namethefarm campaign with pedigree Gloucester cattle.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tomas Matousek</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Sunday, 2 October is the final day of <a href=\"http://www.lovebritishfood.co.uk/\">British Food Fortnight</a> (BFF).

As BFF founder Alexia Robinson says: \u201cThis is a watershed moment for British food. Subsidised and regulated for 40 years by Europe, our farmers will now be competing in a global market place \u2026 we need \u2026 a robust supply of quality domestic food.\u201d So what\u2019s to be done?</p> <p>The \u201cagri-food\u201d sector in the UK was <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/526395/foodpocketbook-2015update-26may16.pdf\">worth \u00a3109bn in 2014, employing one in eight of the national workforce</a>. \u201cAgri-food\u201d includes manufacturing, wholesaling, retailing and catering: only 10% comes from farming.</p> <p>In three years, <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-36764592\">1,000 dairy farms have gone</a>, beaten by cheap milk. The income of pig farmers fell by 46% last year and the income of cereal farmers has declined 24%. British farmers receive 60% of their income from EU Common Agricultural Policy payments given, for instance, for improvements to the environment. The government has <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/chancellor-philip-hammond-guarantees-eu-funding-beyond-date-uk-leaves-the-eu\">pledged to continue to pay \u00a33bn a year provided under CAP until 2020,</a> but what then?</p> <p>Until the early 1960s the farmer dictated what was on offer, according to the seasons. Now, while some relationships between retailers and suppliers are long and mutually beneficial, more negative examples are not hard to find.</p> <p>One apple farmer says he was encouraged to grow more and more apples, \u201cthen the supermarkets refused to pay what we needed to survive People rightly talk about food waste but we had to destroy apple trees that were five and six years old with plenty of life.\u201d. Another says he supplied green beans to a high-end retailer which were sent more than 100 miles away for packing, ignoring the environmental cost,while a third of the crop would be rejected in the name of perfection, supposedly demanded by the customer but in practice demanded by supermarket buyers.</p> <p>Last year the National Farmers\u2019 Union set up a <a href=\"http://www.nfuonline.com/assets/6105\">Fruit and Veg Pledge</a> to encourage supermarkets to treat growers and packers across the UK equally and fairly. The increasingly powerful discounter <a href=\"https://www.nfuonline.com/news/staff-blogs/blog-how-we-broke-aldis-fruit-and-veg-pledge/\">Aldi was the first to sign</a>, followed by Lidl and this month <a href=\"http://www.coop.co.uk/corporate/press/press-releases/Food/Co-op-announces-support-of-NFUs-fruit-and-veg-pledge-at-inaugural-farming-conference/\">the Co-op</a> \u2013 and so far that\u2019s it.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jun/20/lidl-makes-fruit-and-veg-pledge-to-back-british-farmers\">Lidl makes 'fruit and veg pledge' to back British farmers</a> </p> </aside>  <p>A survey last year of 1,141 suppliers revealed that 70% had at least one problem under the Groceries Supply Code of Practice with the supermarket chains. <a href=\"https://www.bitterwallet.com/high-street-news/suppliers-too-scared-to-complain-about-supermarkets-86147\">These included such issues as charging for shelf space, short-term contracts and delaying payments</a>. At the same time, the power of the supermarkets, as well as food processors and big agri-business (companies producing grain, chemicals and hi-tech equipment to try to correct the wrongs imposed by intensive farming), is changing the shape of farming.</p> <p>For instance, \u201cbed and breakfast farms\u201d are growing in number \u2013 where a farmer owns the buildings and provides water, straw, machinery etc, and the major producer provides the rest, including livestock, feed and veterinary services. A fee is paid to the farmer for looking after the pig or \u201cfinishing\u201d the cow in its last few weeks.</p> <p>Again, the supermarkets are centralising processing and slaughtering systems on an industrial scale. In recent years 75% of abattoirs have closed, replaced, for instance, by Waitrose\u2019s use of a central slaughterhouse at Dovecote Park, Yorkshire. These are changes that are bound to entail a big increase in animals transported long distances at an environmental cost. The RSPCA believes all animals should be slaughtered close to the point of production to minimise stress (which also affects the quality of meat).</p> <p>All the big supermarkets insisted they had good relations with suppliers and strongly supported British produce. \u201cOur aim is to offer customers great quality and value \u2026 and we are continuing to do this by working well with our partners,\u201d a Sainsbury\u2019s spokesman said. A spokesperson for Aldi said: \u201cUnlike other retailers, once we have agreed terms with suppliers we do not change them midway through the agreement or ask for additional monies to support better positioning of goods or increased shelf space \u2026 Aldi is a privately owned company and therefore not beholden to City shareholders\u2026 We do not need to generate the same gross margin as others in the sector to deliver strong and stable profits.\u201d</p> <p>Supermarket clout is one issue: what is being done to our animals to get fatter livestock, ever quicker, is another. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/grahamharvey\">Graham Harvey</a>, an agricultural adviser to <em>The Archers</em>, and author of <em>Grass-Fed Nation: Getting Back the Food We Deserve</em>, is an advocate of the grass-fed movement. Animals, many of them ruminant, spend their lives \u201cnon-grazing\u201d indoors, fed on grain that would be better used in human diets. Harvey argues that if ruminants returned to grass, instead of grain there would be more than enough food for a global population predicted to reach 8.5 billion by 2030.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"985b174a325cbecf7e4038b13d503159e93b64d8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/985b174a325cbecf7e4038b13d503159e93b64d8/0_192_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Outdoor pigs\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Only 1.5% of pigs in the UK live outdoors for their entire lives.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Murdo Macleod/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>He says \u201cpoor science\u201d, \u201ccorporate ruthlessness\u201d and our own lack of interest means that more than half of EU cereals that could provide food for growing populations are fed to animals producing less nutritional meat. This requires intensive crop production, GM crops and chemicals, insecticides, pesticides, plant growth hormones and \u201cagri-tech\u201d to coax exhausted land to produce, all of which leads to water pollution, soil degradation and biodiversity loss. In 2013 the government announced a <a href=\"http://www.rothamsted.ac.uk/our-science/2020-wheat\">programme</a> in collaboration with one of the three major global agri-chemical companies, Syngenta, to lift average wheat yield from the current 8 tonnes a hectare to 20 tonnes in two decades. Harvey says: \u201cIf we didn\u2019t have such a distorted economy, and agri-business had to pay for the soil degradation and pollution it causes, good food would be cheaper. Supermarkets are not going to change until consumers insist on change. In the meantime, government should be tackling the shareholder power invested in keeping the system that we have.\u201d</p> <p>In June, a respected international thinktank, the <a href=\"http://www.ipes-food.org/\">International Panel of Experts on Sustainable Food Systems (IPES-Food)</a>, said in a major report that two billion people suffer micronutrient deficiencies because food systems produce an abundance of energy-rich but nutrient-poor crops. Olivier de Schutter, co-chair said, \u201cMany of the problems in food systems are linked specifically to the uniformity at the heart of industrial agriculture and its reliance on chemical fertilisers and pesticides.\u201d</p> <p>In the same month, international researchers from Food Research Collaboration, a body connecting academics to civil society, called on EU states to review its food system. Professor Tim Lang, a senior adviser to FRC, said: <a href=\"http://www.hortweek.com/expert-flags-opportunity-shape-food-legislation-following-brexit/edibles/article/1402731\">\u201cPolicymakers are either too hesitant or too dazzled by a belief that technology will resolve future food problems. They cannot. Food culture also needs to change.\u201d</a></p> <p>There is no easy way to make that happen. One tool would be to increase transparency in the food chain by making labels count for more \u2013 but that would need customers to read the small print, make choices and pay a little extra. While some logos such as the <a href=\"https://www.soilassociation.org/\">Soil Association</a> and <a href=\"http://industry.freedomfood.co.uk/\">RSPCA\u2019s Freedom Foods</a> have higher standards, the largest food assurance scheme in the UK, <a href=\"http://www.redtractor.org.uk/choose-site\">Red Tractor (RT)</a>, is staffed and funded by the industry. The label tells you where the food is farmed, processed and packed \u2013 but is that enough?</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/apr/05/national-farmers-union-nfu-supermarket-sourcing-guide\">NFU shoppers sourcing guide</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In 2012 Sainsbury\u2019s dropped the RT label. Asked why, then chief executive Justin King said: \u201cRed Tractor does not tell the customer anything special about the product \u2026 it doesn\u2019t add any value.\u201d Sturgeon in Suffolk disagrees. \u201cRed Tractor has been very effective in raising the standards of both food production and food safety,\u201d he says.</p> <p>RT employs 450 independent inspectors to regulate 50,000 farms. Chief executive David Clarke says very few fail to comply with standards. Asked if consumers should have more precise information on labels, he said: \u201cThat may be true of a small subset of shoppers, but generally [customers] are content to know the country of origin.\u201d</p> <p>If \u201cBritish\u201d is on the label, the implication is that it signals quality and high animal welfare \u2013 but is that always the case? Several months ago <a href=\"http://www.viva.org.uk/\">Viva!, a vegan animal welfare organisation</a>, published a gruelling report into pig farming, the <a href=\"http://www.viva.org.uk/new-big-pig-report\"><em>New Big Pig Report</em></a>. Three pigs are slaughtered every second in the UK. Only 1.5% are organic and live outdoors for their entire lives; 80% of pigs, which are highly intelligent animals, have their tails docked without anaesthetic, the report says. A high percentage of piglets have their teeth clipped so they don\u2019t bite the nipple; 60% of breeding sows give birth in crates in which they cannot turn around, and remain in the crates until the piglets are weaned. All of this is legal.</p> <p>Ninety per cent of British pigs are reared on farms that take part in the RT scheme. In 2015 there were only 35 prosecutions over \u201cwelfare on farms\u201d; the vast majority of the convictions involved animals reared outdoors and visible to the public, according to Viva!.</p> <p>Assurance schemes obviously require decent standards of welfare, clear information, rigour in policing and independence. When standards are poor, the Department for the Environment, Farming and Rural Affairs (Defra) is responsible for investigating complaints on farms and the Food Standards Agency (FSA) looks at food fraud and mislabelling. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/nov/11/defra-hit-by-largest-budget-cuts-of-any-uk-government-department-analysis-shows\">Both are much depleted</a>, another cause for concern about what we are swallowing. Defra is said to be suffering cuts of almost 60% and the FSA is finding \u00a322m in savings.</p> <p>In February, checks on hundreds of samples in West Yorkshire revealed more than a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/feb/07/fake-food-scandal-revealed-tests-products-mislabelled\">third were not what they claimed to be</a> \u2013 beef mince adulterated with pork, \u201cham\u201d made from poultry. West Yorkshire\u2019s public health analyst said at the time: \u201cWe are routinely finding problems with more than a third of samples, which is disturbing at a time when the budget \u2026 is being cut.\u201d If the odds are increasing that you can\u2019t always believe what you read on the label, how else can credibility be restored to promises of \u201clocal\u201d, \u201cfarm fresh\u201d and \u201cpremium\u201d?</p> <p>Matthew Rymer and his business partner, Clifford Freeman, have launched a campaign, <a href=\"http://happerley.com\">#NametheFarm,</a> to encourage consumers to exercise their power and challenge restaurants, butchers and retailers to be transparent about what\u2019s on offer. (Supermarkets have begun using fictional British farm names to brand produce flown in from all over the world.)</p> <p>Rymer and Freeman breed pedigree Gloucester beef, \u201cgrass fed, taken in our transport to a local abattoir all within sight of Gloucester cathedral\u201d. Their new campaign is part of their scheme called <a href=\"http://happerley.com/\">Happerley Passports</a> (the name taken from Apperley, their nearest village) designed to establish traceability across the food chain. \u201cProvenance should not be the preserve of the rich,\u201d Rymer says. \u201cEven if it\u2019s a \u00a33.99 battery chicken, why shouldn\u2019t the customer know its story?\u201d The passport is free to farmers and a small levy is charged to restaurants and retailers. By way of a mobile phone or the Happerley website, it gives the life story of a product \u2013 in beef, for instance, the breed, age when slaughtered, distance travelled to abattoir, farm of origin, and so on.</p> <p>But do consumers really want such granular detail about the ingredient in their casseroles? \u201cBy linking the food on our plates and in packaging back to the farmer we could create the most connected and transparent food industry with huge export potential,\u201d Rymer says. \u201cBrexit gives an opportunity to rewrite the rules. More information for consumers, whether they access it or not, has to mean better scrutiny and improved animal welfare.\u201d It reduces the room for fraud. It also has the potential to put pressure on supermarkets to change some of their methods.</p> <p>The idea of transparency in the food chain to encourage a change in the culture is gaining ground. For instance, the <a href=\"http://www.pastureforlife.org/\">Pasture Fed Livestock Association</a>, five years old, has 250 members, mostly farmers, who sell either direct or via butchers and farm shops. Its livestock is reared only on grass in summer and silage in winter, offering meat that \u2013 according to research \u2013 is higher in vitamins E and B and beta-carotene. A shopper scans the QR code on the meat\u2019s label or enters the label\u2019s number on the PFLA website to receive detailed information(Defra, however, defines \u201cpasture fed\u201d as 51% fed on grass, which further confuses consumers.)</p> <p>\u201cWe are not organic,\u201d says Dr John Medley, chair of the PFLA, \u201cBut like the organic sector we raise questions in the minds of consumers about the provenance of their food.\u201d</p> <p>Last month the British Veterinary Association <a href=\"https://www.bva.co.uk/news-campaigns-and-policy/newsroom/news-releases/vets-call-for-clear-animal-welfare-labels-for-uk-consumers/\">called for mandatory animal welfare labels on meat</a> in an attempt to stamp out cruel practices. <a href=\"http://www.labellingmatters.org/\">Labelling Matters</a>, a campaign set up by Compassion in World Farming and the RSPCA among others, is calling for labels that discard euphemisms in favour, for instance, of \u201cintensive indoor\u201d for pork from pigs that never go outside and \u201cpermanently housed\u201d for dairy cows that never graze in fields.</p> <p>The Co-op is funding a 12-week pilot with a social enterprise, <a href=\"https://www.provenance.org/\">Provenance</a>, to see how it can increase transparency on labelling \u201cto provide a digital history so every product tells a story\u201d. Catherine Higgs of the Co-op says labelling has clout: \u201cWe are proud to have been the first to label eggs intensively produced, a technically illegal step but which directly led to the law changing to allow eggs to be labelled \u2018From caged hens\u2019.\u201d (Tesco plans to end the sale of eggs from caged hens \u2013 1.4bn eggs a year \u2013 by 2025.)</p> <p>So where do we go from here? In 2001, following the foot-and-mouth disaster, the government commissioned <a href=\"http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20100807034701/http:/archive.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/farming/pdf/PC%20Report2.pdf\">a report on the future of farming</a>. It concluded: \u201cEngland\u2019s farming and food industry is unsustainable in every sense of that term. It is serving nobody well. Farming has become detached from the rest of the economy and the environment \u2026 the key objective from public policy should be to reconnect farming with its market and the rest of the food chain; to reconnect the food chain with the countryside; and reconnect consumers with what they eat and how it is produced.\u201d It\u2019s food for thought that, 15 years on, none of those reconnections have been realised.</p> <p>How we create a more honest food chain is complicated and contradictory. Food is cheap, but still people in this country go hungry. While \u201cethical\u201d food including organic and Fair Trade has steadily increased in popularity, in 2015 it made up only 8.5% of the market. Locally sourced produce and pasture-fed livestock widen consumer choice and offer healthier alternatives, but can\u2019t yet meet the scale of supply supermarket chains demand. So, greater education about what constitutes a healthy diet, the learning beginning at school-age plus good information conveyed on labelling, monitored by bodies independent from industry, are vital \u2013 as is willingness to exercise our consumer muscle.</p> <p>Three men, Andronicos Sideras, Ulrik Nielsen from Denmark and Alex Ostler-Beech, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/sep/27/three-men-face-fraud-trial-horsemeat-scandal\">appeared in court</a> in late September accused of arranging beef and horsemeat to be combined and sold as beef in the UK in 2012 in supermarkets including Tesco and Aldi. It shouldn\u2019t take another horsemeat scandal or outbreak of foot-and-mouth \u2013 or report of yet more damage to the environment \u2013 to encourage us to restrain the accelerating power of the major supermarkets and put a proper value on provenance.</p> <ul> <li><em>This article was amended on 4 October 2016 to remove a reference to Iceland supermarkets.</em><br></li> </ul>",

A group of Tory MPs and former cabinet ministers who want to leave the EU as soon as possible and quit the single market say that May must be prepared to walk away from formal Brexit negotiations under<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/25/article-50-brexit-debate-britain-eu\"> article 50</a> of the Lisbon treaty if the European commission and other EU leaders refuse swiftly to accept her terms.</p> <p>Writing in the <em>Observer</em> on behalf of the group, which includes Iain Duncan Smith, John Redwood and Owen Paterson, the chair of the public administration select committee, Bernard Jenkin, says: \u201cA growing number of people support a speedy and clean break with the EU.\u201d He adds that May must be ready to play hardball with Brussels. \u201cWe need to be aware that article 50, as intended, could tie us up in knots. So we must be prepared to leave without any formal agreement if necessary, or the commission has us over a barrel.\u201d</p> <p>A new \u201chard Brexit\u201d campaign group is to launch in Birmingham under the name Leave Means Leave, set up by businessman Richard Tice. The group issued a report on Saturday saying that May should trigger <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/25/article-50-brexit-debate-britain-eu\">article 50</a> early next year and make a commitment to be out of the EU by early 2019. Former chairman of the British Chambers of Commerce John Longworth announced that he was joining the group as a co-chairman.</p> <p>The latest Opinium/<em>Observer</em> poll puts the Tories on 38% and Labour on 31%, with Ukip on 16% and the Liberal Democrats on 5%. Theresa May is seen by 44% of voters as the best prime minister, as against 17% who say Jeremy Corbyn would do the best job.</p>",
  "<p>When David Cameron delivered <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2010/oct/06/david-cameron-speech-tory-conference\">his first party conference speech as prime minister in October 2010</a>, he mentioned the \u201cbig society\u201d 10 times and Europe hardly at all. The Tory-Lib Dem coalition was still young and he was full of praise for Nick Clegg. The word Brexit was not even in the lexicon, never mind the speech. A compassionate, pragmatic Conservatism was his central theme.</p> <p>Theresa May will open her first Conservative conference as PM in the same Birmingham arena but in a political world transformed. She will lead a session entitled Global Britain: Making a Success of Brexit. She will also announce plans for a great repeal bill that will remove the 1972 European Communities Act from the statute book on the day the UK leaves. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/06/david-davis-single-market-stance-not-government-policy\">David Davis</a>, secretary of state for exiting the European Union, and Boris Johnson, the foreign secretary, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/feb/21/boris-johnson-eu-referendum-campaign-for-brexit-david-cameron\">who led the Leave campaign over the summer,</a> will also speak, along with international development secretary Priti Patel, another hardline Brexiter. One MP who campaigned to leave the EU predicted that the two-hour debate would be a \u201cBrexit fest\u201d with much \u201cwhooping and cheering\u201d from the Tory grassroots. Cameron and George Osborne, who fought tooth and nail to stay in the EU, are not expected to show their faces in Birmingham for the entire four days.</p> <p>The stage is therefore clear for May to make her mark, amid competing demands from rival wings of her party for more detail about how she plans to make Britain succeed outside the EU. Will the UK turn its back on the single market completely? Or will it negotiate a halfway house with some access for UK firms, and participation in some form in its rules on free movement of people? Whatever path she chooses, it will be strewn with Brexit mines.</p> <p>In what now seems like political prehistory, Cameron failed completely to shut down Tory arguments over the EU by imploring his MPs to stop \u201cbanging on about Europe\u201d. In the end he was pushed by his party and Ukip into pledging an in/out referendum <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/24/david-cameron-downfall-european-tragedy\">that led the UK out of the EU and ended his premiership</a>. Now \u2013 after Brexit \u2013 May is also discovering that prime-ministerial words on Europe often fall on deaf Tory ears. Her attempt to reassure doubters by insisting that \u201cBrexit means Brexit\u201d, her vow not to give a \u201crunning commentary\u201d on negotiations and now her pledge of a great repeal bill to do the inevitable and scrap European Communities Act will not silence the warring party. The vote to leave on 23 June has not ended the Conservative party\u2019s interminable division over Europe, just opened a new, more intense phase of combat between those on the right who want Brexit to be hard, fast and total, others on the pro-EU left who want something soft that keeps involvement in the single market, and middle-way pragmatists who want a solution somewhere in between.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5265cd52f0b224d55d6fb2cc00bc1cf36f25fd76\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5265cd52f0b224d55d6fb2cc00bc1cf36f25fd76/0_117_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Iain Duncan Smith is among Tory MPs demanding a hard Brexit.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Iain Duncan Smith is among Tory MPs demanding a hard Brexit.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Daniel Leal-Olivas/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Even before they set off for the Midlands, all sides in the Tory Brexit conflict were calling for more detail from May, as they tugged at her opposing sides. Several former cabinet ministers and leading Conservative backbenchers are not only <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/18/tory-eurosceptics-push-for-hard-brexit-eu-single-market\">demanding a \u201chard Brexit\u201d</a> \u2013 to restore full sovereignty by leaving the single market and taking back control of UK borders \u2013 but what would in effect be a \u201ctake it or leave it\u201d Brexit as soon as is humanly possible.</p> <p>Buoyed by signs that the UK economy is performing better than expected after the Brexit vote, they want May\u2019s government to table its demands to the other 27 member states immediately, and insist that if these are not met quickly then the UK should walk out of negotiations, and simply leave. Senior Conservative MP Bernard Jenkin says <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/25/article-50-brexit-debate-britain-eu\">article 50</a> of the Lisbon treaty, under which formal divorce talks will take place, is a potential trap. \u201cWe need to be aware that article 50, as intended, could tie us up in knots. Nobody can guarantee that there will be an acceptable agreement at the end of the process anyway. So we must be prepared to leave without any formal agreement if necessary, or the commission has us over a barrel. Leaving without a formal withdrawal agreement would be messy, but a messy Brexit is what many have suggested the commission and much of the EU would like.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The prime minister should clarify soonest when she is serving Article 50</p> <footer> <cite>Richard Tice, Leave Means Leave</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>These hardline anti-EU Tories have, over the years, become so weary of Brussels extending its powers, and cynical about the UK government\u2019s desire and ability to stop it, that they fear the spoils of referendum victory may still be denied them at the death. If ministers dither, they fear a Brexit fudge which will leave the UK little, if at all, freer than before.</p> <p>Impatience is growing, too, among Brexit-supporting business leaders, who will also use the Birmingham meeting to demand more clarity. Richard Tice, CEO of asset management company Quidnet Capital Partners, who helped fund the Leave.EU campaign, will be launching his new group Leave Means Leave in Birmingham. He told the <em>Observer</em> that what UK businesses need more than a speedy Brexit is certainty about when it will happen. But he does nonetheless want the UK out by early 2019. \u201cGlobal and domestic businesspeople want certainty around timing, so they can plan,\u201d he said. \u201cThe prime minister should clarify soonest when she is serving article 50, which should be no later than the first quarter of 2017, and that we will leave no later than two years afterwards, with or without an EU deal.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"108fe61130436659c0502e34accdbcbbbea7adba\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/108fe61130436659c0502e34accdbcbbbea7adba/0_71_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Theresa May, pictured last week, is under pressure from left and right on Europe.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Theresa May, pictured last week, is under pressure from left and right on Europe.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Matt Cardy/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In a report published on Sunday, Leave Means Leave urges ministers to fight for a zero-tariff free-trade deal (similar to that which Canada is set to sign at the end of October) with the EU once they have triggered article 50.</p> <p>The feeling among most Tory MPs and activists as the conference begins is that May, Davis, Johnson and Liam Fox, the international trade secretary, are tending towards a hard Brexit along the lines Tice would like. Increasingly there is a realisation that because immigration was the main concern for most Leave voters, continued single market membership will be, as one minister put it, \u201cpolitically unsellable\u201d, as it would involve accepting EU free-movement rules. Jonathan Isaby, editor of a new website, <a href=\"http://brexitcentral.com\">Brexit Central</a>, set up by Matthew Elliott, the former chief executive of Vote Leave, said anything less than hard Brexit would be seen by the public as a betrayal. \u201cThe signals from the government are getting ever clearer that we will see a clean Brexit: restoring full sovereignty to Westminster, taking back control of our borders, and giving elected British politicians the power to negotiate our own trade deals around the globe. This clean Brexit is what the British public voted for in such large numbers at the referendum. Any deal that involved membership of the single market \u2013 which is being promoted by some Remain campaigners unwilling to accept the verdict of the British people \u2013 would be akin to a phoney Brexit and totally unacceptable.\u201d</p> <h2>\u2018Disaster\u2019</h2> <p>But the pro-EU Tory left, backed by serious and powerful pro-European business leaders and groups, will have none of it. They will be in Birmingham making precisely the opposite arguments. They accept that Brexit will happen, but say the UK will face serious economic harm unless it retains maximum access to the single market, even if this means accepting some freedom of movement. Some Tories, such as ex-minister <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/30/anna-soubry-brands-liam-foxs-free-trade-speech-delusional\">Anna Soubry</a>, say an end to EU free movement would be a disaster for many UK firms, who will no longer be able to staff their operations.<br></p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/29/former-tory-ministers-demand-clear-brexit-plan-theresa-may\">Former education secretary Nicky Morgan</a>, who was sacked by May in July, will take up a new role as chair of the pro-European Tory Mainstream group, and warn that a hard Brexit would not only be an act of economic self-harm, but also risk unleashing and legitimising bigotry. In a hard-hitting speech just hours after May\u2019s, Morgan will say: \u201cThere are already those for whom the referendum result is not enough \u2013 they want us to have a hard Brexit which cuts us off from the EU, turns our back on the single market and allows people to say things about their fellow citizens that promote intolerance and bigotry. We should, and we will, ask questions about Brexit. There will be complex negotiations, and it would be wrong to throw away, without question, access to the single market simply because free movement is likely to be part of those negotiations too.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"28e4ab46c01ad0d8ff8d7734f6507317c4735d39\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/28e4ab46c01ad0d8ff8d7734f6507317c4735d39/0_0_4320_2591/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Former education secretary Nicky Morgan is calling for flexibility on Brexit.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Former education secretary Nicky Morgan is calling for flexibility on Brexit.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Richard Gardner/Rex Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Cheering her on will be former chancellor Kenneth Clarke and ex-minister Nick Herbert, as well as representatives from UK industry.

Ghosn said his firm would need \u201ccompensation\u201d for tax barriers that might result from Britain leaving the European Union.</p> <p>Mike Hawes, chief executive of the Society of Motor Manufacturers, has now added his voice to those asking for a Brexit plan for business to use when looking to the future. \u201cThe current uncertainty is not conducive to attracting manufacturing investment to the UK. The government must do all it can to maintain the competitiveness of the UK automotive sector, which has been hugely successful in boosting exports, creating jobs and generating economic growth in recent years.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Look at what happened to the moderate Republicans in America \u2013 they ended up with Trump</p> <footer> <cite>Nicky Morgan</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Morgan, who has already criticised May\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/sep/09/theresa-may-to-end-ban-on-new-grammar-schools\">plans for extending grammar schools</a>, sees a wider danger for the party from Brexit, fearing that it could instil a rightwing intolerant mentality and a desire to vacate the centre ground, which would have disastrous and ugly consequences. \u201cLook at what happened to the moderate mainstream Republicans in America who didn\u2019t defend their views against a Tea Party-led lurch to the right \u2013 eventually they ended up with Donald Trump as candidate,\u201d she will argue.</p> <p>May is working hard to show that her government, rather than being rightwing, hard-edged and Brexit-obsessed, is overall a sensitive and moderate one. On entering Downing Street she made clear that she wanted to govern for all and not just the \u201cprivileged few\u201d. She quickly ditched much of the Cameron and Obsorne agenda, and signalled an end to austerity, angering many of the Cameroons in the process. On Saturday the announcement by work and pension secretary Damian Green that tens of thousands of people claiming the main benefit for long-term sickness will no longer face repeated medical assessments to keep their payments, showed, Green said, that the government was \u201chard-headed not hard-hearted\u201d.</p> <p>At conference, some predict further measures for the less well-off, including a shift toward helping those in the rental sector who the Tories are often accused of ignoring. But hard as May tries to build her own programme, her first conference and her first term as prime minister will inevitably be dominated by the Brexit debate and Brexit divisions.</p> <p>So deep is the Tory divide on the issue, and so small is May\u2019s majority in parliament (17), that many MPs \u2013 across all main parties \u2013 believe she could still, despite her denials so far, call a general election in spring or autumn next year. With Labour on the floor, they argue, she could then win her own mandate for the kind of Brexit she wants and increase the Tory majority to much nearer 100. An Opinium/<em>Observer</em> poll on Sunday has put the Tories (on 38%), seven points ahead of Labour (31%). Ukip is on 16% and the Lib Dems and SNP on 5% each.</p> <p>But even more encouragingly for those Tories who would like her to go to the country, more than twice as many members of the public (44%) think May would be the best prime minister than believe the same of Jeremy Corbyn (just 17%). While Brexit divisions will take centre stage in Birmingham, the issue of whether to call a snap election that could give her the power to govern despite them will probably be exercising May more than she will publicly admit.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"9f876f311134f0ab9f5096e3c82905d10ffe4def\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9f876f311134f0ab9f5096e3c82905d10ffe4def/1312_755_2999_3085/972.jpg\" alt=\"Ken Clarke\" width=\"972\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Rt Hon Kenneth Clarke QC MP.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Felix Clay/for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>The three groups \u2013 and their aims<br></h2> <p><strong>The hard Brexiters</strong> (Theresa May, Boris Johnson, Liam Fox, David Davis, Andrea Leadsom<em>) </em>Leave the single market and give up on a deal under which the EU accepts that British regulations have equal weight. This could lead to extra paperwork for businesses exporting to the EU, but it would see the UK government having free rein to curb free movement and establish trade deals with a host of other countries on its own terms.</p> <p><strong>The soft Brexiters</strong> (Anna Soubry, Ken Clarke, Nicky Morgan, Michael Heseltine<em>) </em>Some see a reluctance within this group to even leave the EU, and it looks like they want another vote on the terms of Brexit once negotiated. If the UK is to leave, however, membership of the single market is seen as key - even if that leads to few restrictions on freedom of movement.</p> <p><strong>In the middle </strong>(Damian Green, Amber Rudd, Philip Hammond<em>) </em>Access to the single market, rather than membership, is vital. The UK would not accept EU jurisdiction over standards of goods, but both parties would be willing to recognise as equally valid each other\u2019s regulations on the safety of widgets, for example. It is said that the UK could follow the model of Liechtenstein: access to the market for goods, but with some control of inward migration.</p>",

That is what happened at Bayern Munich and in my time at Barcelona before that. I\u2019m not just talking about better results but an improvement you can notice in the way we play, the amount of control we have in matches.</p> <p>\u201cI am pleased with the start we have made but it is only a start.

There are still areas to improve in terms of tactics and training and the players we might want to bring in for the future.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/30/mauricio-pochettino-pep-guardiola-rivalry-tottenham-hotspur-manchester-city\">Mauricio Pochettino to face Guardiola as an equal in a rivalry born in Barcelona</a> </p> </aside>  <p>What has Guardiola so far managed to change at City? The goalkeeper, most obviously, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/aug/25/claudio-bravo-manchester-city-joe-hart\">even if Claudio Bravo </a>sometimes uses his feet when it would be easier and more sensible to use his hands, as if trying to prove a point. He has also encouraged more subtle flexibility, with Aleksandar Kolarov occasionally moving to centre-half, David Silva turning up in different parts of the pitch and Fernandinho, while notionally the defensive midfielder, does a bit of everything from dropping deep to supporting the attack.</p> <p>\u201cThat is because Fernandinho can do everything,\u201d Guardiola says. \u201cWhat we have achieved so far would have been impossible without him. He is fast, he is intelligent, strong in the air and he can play in several positions. No sooner does he see a space than he runs there immediately. If you need someone to make a correction or a challenge, he sees it too. If a team had three Fernandinhos, they would be champions. We only have one and he is very important to us.\u201d</p> <p>Perhaps the biggest difference is that Guardiola has ditched the rather staid central midfield trio Manuel Pellegrini used to favour, in order to allow Kevin De Bruyne and Ilkay G\u00fcndogan to form more attacking combinations with Silva further up the pitch.</p> <p>De Bruyne is injured and perhaps was missed in Glasgow but, when all those creative players are available, with Fernandinho behind, Sergio Ag\u00fcero up front and Raheem Sterling running between the lines, City have attacking ideas and options few sides in the league can match.</p> <p>\u201cI want to give my influence to my players, of course,\u201d Guardiola says. \u201cI want to convince them to play in a certain way, not just because I feel like it but because I see a need. I didn\u2019t come here just to change things and I am not the sort of manager who keeps making interventions and ends up losing the game. When I make a decision, the players know the reason why.\u201d</p> <p>City\u2019s record against the top teams last season was unimpressive, so their first encounter with a fellow Champions League participant this season will be keenly studied, though Guardiola is not one for building up the big matches. \u201cThe big teams are more difficult to play against because they have better players,\u201d he says. \u201cThat\u2019s how football works. I\u2019ve told the players all along that it doesn\u2019t matter if we play Tottenham or a Conference team, the points are the same. Every game brings its own complications, whatever the level of your opponents.\u201d</p> <p>If City have managed to make the Premier League look easy so far, does that imply English football is not as demanding as everyone says it is? \u201cNot at all,\u201d Guardiola says.</p> <p>\u201cIt is so difficult. I have seen my players so exhausted in the dressing room after matches they could not speak. Before I came here I was told the Premier League was the toughest in the world, everyone can beat anyone. Now I accept it. It is not easy. I want to give credit to my players for the way they have worked.\u201d</p>",

All those years later, [for Rogerson] to have that amount of clout, quite spooky.\u201d </p> <p>There are three known killings directly attributed to Rogerson: Gao and the \u201con duty\u201d shootings of Lanfranchi and would-be armed robber Lawrence Byrne in 1977. But the whiff of suspicion persists that Rogerson had a hand in at least seven others.</p> <p>During the Gao trial, McNamara alleged Rogerson confessed to him of complicity in the killings of heroin dealers Alan Williams and Luton Chu, as well as Lanfranchi\u2019s partner Sallie-Anne Huckstepp. \u201cBut I suspect there are a lot more,\u201d McNab says.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s a long and sad list and I reckon there would be a few people who have just gone, disappeared, that no one cares about.\u201d</p> <p>The new book explores in richer detail the accounts of Rogerson\u2019s profiteering from crime while a detective, anticipating the pivotal shift in Australian criminal enterprise from armed robberies and safe breaking to drug trafficking.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--showcase\"> <blockquote> <p>There\u2019s just something horribly wrong with Roger\u2019s head.</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>New light is shed on Rogerson\u2019s link to heroin importation via Thai sex workers and trafficking in the 1980s with Melbourne criminal Dennis \u201cDr Death\u201d Allen, who was believed to be involved in the killings of up to 15 people.<br></p> <p>Crucially, McNab has produced a remarkable portrayal of Rogerson\u2019s activities in his twilight years, leading up to the murder of Gao. </p> <p>It is one that\u2019s shatteringly at odds with Rogerson\u2019s public rebirth as a \u201cgenial rogue\u201d through his regular media commentary and improbable stints on the stand up comedy circuit with Mark \u201cChopper\u201d Read under the banner of the Wild Colonial Psychos. </p> <p>Perhaps most striking is the account of Rogerson touting himself as a murderer for hire, asking for \u201c$50k upfront, thanks very much \u2013 and don\u2019t worry, I can still fire a gun even though my knees aren\u2019t great\u201d.</p> <p>McNab also reveals the hitherto unknown depth of Rogerson\u2019s ties with outlaw motorcycle gangs, his close friendship with convicted rapist, kidnapper and Bandido Arthur Loveday among others, as he sought to rekindle drug connections. </p> <p>Rogerson was welcomed in Bandidos and Rebels clubhouses across the country and was regularly seen briefing queues of bikies in coffee shops.</p> <p>\u201cA generation of his colleagues have either keeled over or retired, and Roger\u2019s looking around for fresh playmates,\u201d McNab says.</p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s in his mid-60s but Roger misses being on centre stage in the criminal life so he\u2019s reconstructing his drug-dealing mates.\u201d </p> <p>The latter-day Rogerson was a valued source of advice to criminals on how to find weaknesses in prosecutions against them, building on an already staggering range of underworld contacts. </p> <p>\u201cCrooks loved him. There was a whole coterie of men who liked Roger because Roger could do things for them,\u201d McNab says. </p> <p>\u201cHe could get them out of strife with the coppers, he could tell them how the coppers operated, how best to avoid things, the depth of his knowledge. </p> <p>\u201cHe was also a man who possibly, if you were locked up, could walk up to arresting police and crack a deal for you, either through payment of money or say to the copper, by the way, I\u2019ve got a \u2018brief\u2019 [compromising information] on you.</p> <p>\u201cHe knew that knowing everybody would be good for his own business and this extraordinary, outwardly affable, bright, capable man showed no fear.\u201d</p> <p>Rogerson also used his \u201cinfluencing skills\u201d in a multimillion-dollar civil legal dispute while doing consultant work under the auspices of other people\u2019s private investigator licences.</p> <p>The latter is what brought Rogerson together with McNamara, whose own cultivated image as a former honest cop hung out to dry likewise unravels under McNab\u2019s inspection.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d785301fdea70d5324b3587931122ac010a5ac04\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d785301fdea70d5324b3587931122ac010a5ac04/0_0_3280_1968/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Glen McNamara is escorted by a correctional services officer as he leaves the NSW supreme court in Sydney in February 2016.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Glen McNamara is escorted by a correctional services officer as he leaves the NSW supreme court in Sydney in February 2016.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Paul Miller/AAP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It was McNamara who met Gao through his own consultancy work for lawyers, when the young man was acting as a translator for a friend in strife.</p> <p>The unlikely pairing culminated in Gao, through contacts with a Triad gang in Hong Kong, arranging the import of 3kg of ice from mainland China.</p> <p>Things went fatally wrong for the naive Gao after Rogerson, waiting in the wings on the deal, conceived with McNamara a more brutal but profitable alternative.</p> <p>With his running knowledge of underworld sellers and buyers, Rogerson was a \u201cfantastic middleman but came to grief when he stopped being middleman and decided to actually take a bigger slice\u201d, McNab says.</p> <p>\u201cMy view is it started out as a drug deal that became a rip off and at some point in the planning Roger said, well if it doesn\u2019t go right, we\u2019ll just top him, end of story,\u201d he says.</p> <p>\u201cThe idea was quite simply the Triad in Hong Kong and their enforcers would not know who Jamie Gao was selling to, so if Jamie Gao disappeared and it was done cleanly and concisely, he\u2019d just become a disappeared person.\u201d</p> <p>A source revealed to McNab that Gao\u2019s contact in Hong Kong \u2013 who helped broker introductions with the Triad \u2013 later vanished.</p> <p>Rogerson emerged fresh from the killing at an old mates\u2019 lunch club at a Sydney pub having invited some unfamiliar guests: a well-known boxer with two bikies in tow. The latter are alleged to have been Rogerson\u2019s hope for unloading the ice.</p> <p>Where things went \u201chorribly wrong\u201d for Rogerson was his blindness to the array of CCTV cameras that captured their meeting with Gao in the Padstow storage unit, McNab says. For all his criminal investigation nous, awareness of electronic surveillance was an \u201cold Achilles heel\u201d of Rogerson, who was caught on camera years earlier opening fake bank accounts to deposit $110,000 in cash allegedly from a heroin deal with Allen, McNab says.</p> <p>The book describes the moment Rogerson\u2019s notoriety first betrayed his link to Gao\u2019s murder. As one officer scoured through frames of CCTV vision from the storage unit, an older colleague passing by spotted a figure with a \u201cdistinctive gait\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cShit, that\u2019s Roger!\u201d he said.</p> <p>Gao was unlikely to have had any real idea of the background of the men he was dealing with, particularly Rogerson, McNab says.</p> <p>\u201cHad Jamie been a little bit more dexterous in the use of Google he might actually have not gone to that deal,\u201d he says.</p> <p>\u201cStill, it fascinates me that Roger\u2019s career was brought to an end by a 20-year-old Asian kid with an education.\u201d</p> <p>Rogerson, the once-masterful court performer who swayed a jury to take his word over both Drury\u2019s and the heroin dealer who said he\u2019d paid Rogerson for the hit, will end his life behind bars, serving a life sentence along with McNamara.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jun/28/the-noble-aim-of-open-justice-and-the-publics-right-to-know\">The noble aim of open justice and the public's right to know | Richard Ackland</a> </p> </aside>  <p>More than one acquaintance describes Rogerson as a \u201cpsychopath\u201d but the apparently remorseless killer has never undergone a psychiatric assessment of any depth, McNab says.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s just something horribly wrong with Roger\u2019s head.

  "<p>Eddie Jones was not pulling a flanker when he said, after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/sep/30/england-sam-jones-training-squad-autumn-internationals\" title=\"\">revealing his England squad for the autumn internationals </a>at Twickenham, that he was considering handing Maro Itoje the No7 jersey. Itoje\u2019s brief international career has been spent in the second row, but he has played for Saracens at blindside flanker, the position he occupied when he made his debut for the club, and moving him into James Haskell\u2019s position would give Jones the option of pairing George Kruis and Joe Launchbury in the second row.</p> <p>England do not have an openside flanker in the mould of Richie McCaw, Sam Cane or Sam Warburton but Jones believes that the rigid job descriptions of previous times count little in an era when numbers on the backs of players become blurred after a couple of phases.</p> <p>\u201cAt the moment we have Sam Jones and Mike Williams as potential 7s and, having watched the Premiership matches very closely this season, I cannot find anyone else who fits the bill,\u201d says Jones. \u201cWilliams is not playing there for Leicester, but Haskell does not for his club, Wasps.</p> <p>\u201cIt is about maximising your resources. If you do not have a Richie McCaw or a George Smith, you come unstuck if you try to copy that system, as we did in the third Test in Australia when we wanted Teimana Harrison to play that role and he was not able to at that stage of his career. We moved Maro and played him left and right with Chris Robshaw and that remains a definite possibility looking ahead.</p> <p>\u201cThere is no right and wrong way; you have to work out what suits your team. Very few of the Premiership clubs operate with a traditional 7. While, in the old days, you had forwards playing here and backs playing there, after two or three phases now it is all mixed up. In the forward pack you want three players who are capable of passing the ball and five who can smash their way over the gainline and get the opposition moving backwards.\u201d</p> <p>England gather in Brighton on Sunday with Jones hoping that injury problems have peaked. Owen Farrell has yet to play this season, Haskell and Jack Clifford have been ruled out of the autumn series, and Manu Tuilagi, Jonathan Joseph and the team\u2019s captain, Dylan Hartley, have missed the past three rounds of the&#xa0;Premiership.</p> <p>\u201cMissing players is nothing to be frightened of,\u201d said Jones. \u201cManu\u2019s latest injury is not a concern because it is not something we can control. When he is fit, I will be pleased to have the opportunity to select him. If not, we will pick other players.\u201d</p> <p>Would he be worried at losing the leadership of Hartley and Farrell? \u201cNot at all,\u201d he replied. \u201cWe would find if other leaders stepped up. It is a fantastic opportunity, nothing to be frightened of. And we do have other leaders, I am 100% sure of that, although I do not have to consider yet who would be captain.\u201d</p> <p>One player Jones was unable to consider for the squad was the Saracens wing Chris Ashton, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/sep/20/chris-ashton-saracens-england-biting\" title=\"\">who is serving a 13-week suspension </a>for biting the Northampton prop Alex Waller during the Premiership match at Allianz Park last month, his second long lay-off of the year.</p> <p>\u201cYou cannot endorse any sort of behaviour like that,\u201d said Jones. \u201cHe was found guilty and has been punished. I sent him a text the other day saying if you play well when you come back I will consider you. I am not frustrated by it; that is just the choice he made. He needs to find a good restaurant in Barnet so he is not hungry.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>El Cajon police have released video of the police shooting of Alfred Olango, an unarmed black man whose killing on Tuesday prompted days of protests in the San Diego suburb.</p> <p>Olango was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/28/police-killing-black-man-el-cajon-san-diego-protest\">shot and killed on Tuesday</a> after police confronted the 38-year-old behind a Mexican restaurant with reports that he was \u201c<a href=\"http://www.cityofelcajon.us/Home/Components/News/News/2867/112\">not acting like himself</a>\u201d and walking into traffic.

  "<p>Samantha Power, the American ambassador to the United Nations, says the world has reached a \u201cturning point\u201d over Syria. The Russians, who refuse to halt their relentless bombing of Aleppo, say the <a href=\"https://www.rt.com/news/361020-us-politics-reality-show/\">Obama administration is \u201chysterical\u201d </a>and blaming Moscow for its own failures. The UN, lost for words, believes Syria has become a \u201cslaughterhouse\u201d. Stephen O\u2019Brien, a senior official, warns despairingly that Aleppo is \u201cdescending into the pitiless and merciless abyss of a humanitarian catastrophe\u201d. So what is to be done?</p> <p>The short answer is that nobody seems to know \u2013 or, at least, how to do it. This crisis has been unfolding for five long years. Repeated attempts to set a viable peace process in train have failed. Ceasefires have come and gone, always temporary, always broken by one party or another within days or even hours. The latest truce collapsed last week amid a welter of mutual recriminations.</p> <p>The US now says it is examining \u201cnon-diplomatic\u201d options, possibly new sanctions against the Russian and Syrian governments and individuals deemed responsible for using bunker-buster and incendiary bombs in Aleppo. There are dark mutterings about US airstrikes on Syrian military targets. The latter course could bring US and Russian forces into direct confrontation. It would be the sort of serious escalation that Barack Obama has studiously avoided until now, even when his <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2013/09/06/president-obama-and-the-red-line-on-syrias-chemical-weapons/\">\u201cred line\u201d on chemical weapons was crossed in 2013</a>.</p> <p>Yet this crisis is now about far more than the people of Aleppo, or Syria or even US-Russian relations. The war has destabilised neighbouring countries such as Turkey. It has sparked an unprecedented movement of refugees and economic migrants across Europe\u2019s borders. It has fuelled the rise of jihadi terrorism. It has distracted attention and resources from troublespots such as Yemen. Most significantly, perhaps, in terms of long-term damage, it has dramatically exposed the inherent weakness of the UN system and the growing disrespect shown by states for international law.</p> <p>Russia is the worst offender. It has been warned repeatedly, most recently by Ban Ki-moon, the UN secretary general, that its airstrikes in and around Aleppo and elsewhere against civilian targets, hospitals and schools, may constitute war crimes. The charge sheet includes the destruction of a UN-organised aid convoy in northern Aleppo last month that killed about 20 people. Russian and Syrian <a href=\"http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2016/09/suspends-syria-aid-convoy-bombed-160920080213025.html\">denials of responsibility</a> are widely disbelieved.</p> <p>Russia\u2019s annexation of Crimea in 2014 was another egregious breach of international law, the sort of blatant land grab that most people believed belonged to the bad old days of 1930s Europe. Russia\u2019s complicity, also implausibly denied, in the shooting down of a <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/29/world/asia/malaysia-air-flight-mh17-russia-ukraine-missile.html\">Malaysian civilian airliner over Ukraine two years ago</a>, killing nearly 300 people, was an unforgivable outrage against international rules, not to mention common decency. Russia\u2019s increasing use of cyber warfare, notably the recent hacking of the Democratic party and online electoral systems in the US, is another aspect of its serial disregard for international norms. Russia appears only too willing to manipulate the UN security council, despite its responsibilities as a permanent member. This risks a fundamental erosion of the UN Charter, which set as an objective the \u201cestablishment [of] conditions under which justice and respect for the obligations arising from treaties and other sources of international law can be maintained\u201d. Yet such cynicism is not limited to Vladimir Putin\u2019s regime.</p> <p>Earlier this year, China, another permanent member of the security council, flatly rejected the ruling of the UN-backed permanent court of arbitration in The Hague that its island building and wider maritime claims in the South China Sea <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/12/philippines-wins-south-china-sea-case-against-china\">have no legal basis</a>. Beijing said simply that the decision did not apply, for no better reason than it did not fit its strategic objectives. China has also made clear, following North Korea\u2019s recent, illegal nuclear test, that it reserves the right to block attempts at the UN to impose further sanctions if it does not like them, thereby further undermining attempts to rein in the rogue regime in Pyongyang. Recent joint naval exercises in the South China Sea suggest Russia and China are grimly intent on backing up each other\u2019s bad behaviour.</p> <p>Disrespect for the UN and its institutions is a spreading problem, as seen by the apparent impunity enjoyed by those who attack or hinder its peacekeepers, aid workers and organisations. The too frequent inability of the UN to defend itself and those under its care was exemplified last July in Juba in South Sudan, when aid workers were<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/15/south-sudan-aid-worker-rape-attack-united-nations-un\"> brutally assaulted by army troops</a>. In countries such as Sudan, the failing reach of international law is seen in President Omar al-Bashir\u2019s continuing defiance of warrants for his arrest on charges of genocide and crimes against humanity.</p> <p>The International Criminal Court, which issued the warrants, is not a UN agency. But it is a key legal arm of the international system whose authority is regularly flouted by states that, even though they ratified the founding 2002 Treaty of Rome, do not respect its obligations. This tendency towards impunity is further encouraged by the US and other major countries that are not parties to the treaty even though they support ICC actions. This is the same double standard that allows Washington to complain about the flouting of international law in Syria and Ukraine while ignoring the damaging precedent set in 2003 when the Bush administration invaded Iraq without explicit UN legal authority.</p> <p>The suffering in Aleppo is dreadful. As we have said many times, the combatants must pull back and cease fire, as a prelude to resumed diplomatic efforts. But we must also be clear that, increasingly, long-term structural damage is not confined to Syria. Lawless behaviour by powerful state actors is corroding the crucial institutions created in 1945 to prevent another global conflagration. By allowing international law to be repeatedly flouted, we risk an even greater catastrophe.</p> <p>\u2022 Comments will be opened later today. This article was amended on 2 October 2016.

  "<p>The unreconciled Remainers are urging, \u201cPlay for time\u201d in the hope that the UK\u2019s desire to leave the EU will subside. This is madness. They used to deride their present objective: that we could somehow stay \u201cin the single market\u201d but escape the obligations of EU membership. EU leaders, such as the Italian prime minister last week, continue to make clear that this is impossible. Any deliberate and unnecessary delay would refuel the anguish and bitterness that led many people to vote Leave in the first place.</p> <p>That is why a growing number of people support a speedy and clean break with the EU. Nigel Lawson and David Owen have urged this. Now a group of senior Conservative MPs, including Iain Duncan Smith, John Redwood, Owen Paterson and myself, have set out a series of essays (<em>Road to Brexit,</em> Legatum-CSJ) explaining exactly what Brexit means, how it can be achieved quickly, and why it is in everyone\u2019s interests.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/30/anna-soubry-brands-liam-foxs-free-trade-speech-delusional\">Anna Soubry brands Liam Fox's free trade speech 'delusional'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>We need to be aware that Article 50, as intended, could tie us up in knots. Nobody can guarantee that there will be an acceptable agreement at the end of the process anyway. So we must be prepared to leave without any formal agreement if necessary, or the commission has us over a barrel. Leaving without a formal withdrawal agreement would be messy, but a messy Brexit is what many have suggested that the commission and much of the EU would like. Still, a speedy and decisive resolution would be far more acceptable to business than years and years of uncertainty and then a \u201cfudge\u201d, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/29/german-business-leader-warning-brexit-trade-uk\">as confirmed by Markus Kerber</a>, head of the BDI, the federation of German industries.</p> <p>Without a formal agreement, most things, like security cooperation, would carry on anyway because they have to. Complicated things like patent and data law could be quickly sorted out afterwards. Of course, the big threat is loss of access to the single market, but the UK could start by making it clear we are offering zero tariffs for EU imports, and an open UK market for EU services as now, and that we would implement this unilaterally <em>pro tem</em> in the absence of a withdrawal agreement. What would the EU do? Would they really want to slap on their own tariffs and protectionism anyway?</p> <p>There are two other factors that will drive the UK and the EU towards a quick free trade deal, pre- or post-Brexit. We often pointed out that the UK imports \u00a370bn more from the EU than we export to them, and Remainers always talked down this strength in the UK position. True, while 44% of our exports go to the EU, only 8% of EU exports come to us. But as thinktank <a href=\"http://www.civitas.org.uk/reports_articles/uk-eu-trade-and-jobs-linked-to-exports/\">Civitas explains</a>, protectionism would threaten a far bigger share of jobs in the other EU states than in the UK. UK exports to Germany are estimated to support 752,000 jobs, or 2.4% of UK jobs, but 1.3 million German jobs depend upon their exports to the UK, which is 3.2%. This pattern is repeated across the entire EU. UK exports to France support 1.7% of our jobs, but theirs to the UK support 2.4% of jobs in the France; to Italy, it is 0.9% vs 1.7%; for Belgium, it is 0.8% vs 7.8%; and for Ireland it is 1.4% vs 9.5%. Which countries would rationally support anything but free trade?</p> <p>Even in the event of tariffs, we could spend the billions of extra revenue on reducing company and employment taxes and increasing investment allowances, to offset the tariff costs on industry. We should make that clear to inward investors like Nissan now, so they have no cause to pause investment plans. The other factor is the net \u00a310bn UK contribution to the EU. Sudden loss of this would cause chaos in the EU budget. There is a deal to be done, and quicker than most imagine.</p> <p><em>Bernard Jenkin is MP for Harwich and North Essex and was a founding director of Vote Leave.

  "<p>There were dozens of small but fierce fires blazing in the pre-dawn gloom of Freedom Square when Mohammed Helwani arrived, summoned by walkie-talkie to the site of Aleppo\u2019s latest bombing. It looked like a white phosphorous attack, he thought, as he prepared to join a handful of people racing to put out the flames with soil and dust gathered from the surrounding streets. Then he heard the sound of jets circling back overhead.</p> <p>\u201cI jumped inside the entrance of a building without thinking,\u201d said Helwani, a 31-year-old with four children, who leads the local revolutionary council for al-Shaar district. \u201cThe second attack hit near a hospital a few hundred metres from the square.\u201d</p> <p>He thinks the intended targets were medical facilities for women and children, or perhaps a major blood bank on the square. In the last week of attacks that have killed more than 300 civilians, missiles have repeatedly hit hospitals, search and rescue centres and other civilian centres.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/01/-syriaairstrikes-major-offensive-against-rebel-held-areas-of-aleppo\">Syria: Aleppo hospital hit by barrel bombs and cluster bombs, reports say</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The airstrikes last week were just the latest in a string of shells, rockets, barrel bombs and other weapons to hit this small patch of Aleppo. The site of protests and celebrations, bloodshed and healing, its fate over the past five years offers a snapshot of the suffering and turmoil of a city engulfed by civil war.</p> <p>The square \u2013 really more of a dusty crossroads with space for a crowd to form \u2013 earned its name in the early days of the uprising against the government of President Bashar al-Assad, when it became a popular site for demonstrations.</p> <p>Before the war it was an unremarkable spot in al-Shaar district, called \u201cHealing Home Square\u201d, after one of the clinics clustered nearby. Some of those nearby hospitals have survived, although medical services for the quarter of a million people trapped in east Aleppo have collapsed since then, leaving a bare-bones service staffed with volunteers and a handful of overstretched doctors.</p> <p>\u201cThis location was chosen for the blood bank as it\u2019s in the centre of the city and close to many hospitals,\u201d said 22-year-old Ahmed Abu Murad, a volunteer at the centre, which was set up less than a year ago when managers decided they needed to move from a hard-hit part of the old city.</p> <p>The site\u2019s history was a constant reminder that they might be a target. \u201cIt had been a field hospital before it was abandoned due to an airstrike,\u201d Murad said. But as nowhere in opposition-held Aleppo is safe, the group carried out some basic repairs and then started work.</p> <p>Volunteers spend two days a week collecting blood donations for screening, and most of the rest of the week handing out supplies and helping medics at the besieged city\u2019s shrinking number of medical centres, where there are now only around 30 doctors to try to treat the flood of casualties.</p> <p>Murad was in an ambulance helping a friend transfer casualties of another attack when the radio crackled with news that a missile had landed near their own headquarters.</p> <p>\u201cWe drove back as fast as we could to find fires all around, but thank God the bombs landed some distance from the fuel tanks,\u201d he said. Inured to death and destruction, he saw the attack more as narrow escape than near-tragedy.</p> <p>\u201cI jumped from the car to start putting out the small bombs with soil. Then the white helmets [search and rescue] team came to extinguish them with us.

It was horrific.\u201d It also brought painful echoes of another day of bloodshed two years ago, one of Ruba\u2019s worst memories of the war, when a barrel bomb hit a colleague in the square.</p> <p>\u201cIt was a Sunday in July. He was taking aid to orphans,\u201d she said. \u201cIt made me so sad. He was top of his year at university, and separated from his family.\u201d They kept his body, refusing to bury their friend until his parents were able to cross from the government-held side of the city to say goodbye.</p> <p>For Murad too, the square mixes memories of death and freedom. Last summer he arrived at the site that would later be his workplace to collect bodies from the ruins of a field hospital, after two barrel bombs ripped it apart.</p> <p>\u201cThat was a bad day. I was tired from transporting injured people from other neighbourhoods, and came to find many cars smashed, buildings damaged, and our beloved field hospital out of service, with many memories buried in the wreckage.\u201d</p> <p>Last week the people of al-Shaar were relatively lucky. Once the flames were put out and the smoke had cleared, they found only two injured victims and the damage relatively minor in a city where whole apartment buildings have been brought down, Helwani said.</p> <p>The years of bombing have taken their toll on the local civilian population in the neighbourhood, barely 1% of the 300,000 who lived there before the fighting began. After an hour, what passes as normality returned.</p> <p>\u201cFortunately, the square was empty because people stayed home when they heard attacks nearby. Afterwards the cigarette vendors came back and calm returned,\u201d said Helwani, who was closely involved with the early days of revolution in Syria.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/23/ignore-bombs-humanitarian-aid-syria-un-convoy\">We will ignore the bombs to continue delivering humanitarian aid in Syria | Sonja Meyer</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Freedom Square was where he celebrated the rebel takeover of their neighbourhood, but also the first place he saw the carnage that is now a part of his daily life. \u201cThe day the opposition took control, I brought an amplifier and speakers.

  "<p>The<em> Daily Mail</em> might have compiled the far left\u2019s hitlist of Labour MPs. Seven of its apparent deselection targets are women: Angela Eagle, Jess Phillips, Stella Creasy, Louise Ellman, Anna Turley, Luciana Berger and Ruth Smeeth. Of these, Angela Eagle is an out lesbian and Louise Ellman, Ruth Smeeth and Luciana Berger are Jewish.

The only difference between their insults and the insults of the Corbynistas, she tells me, is that the far left is \u201ca bit less rapey\u201d. When men\u2019s rights activists went for Phillips in 2015, Jeremy Corbyn defended her. Now that his own supporters are following suit, the Pilate-like Corbyn washes his hands and piously intones that local parties must decide whether to deselect<a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/09/19/jeremy-corbyn-accused-of-leaving-colleagues-hung-out-to-dry-by-o/\" title=\"\"> their MP </a>.

In it Goodman wrote: \u201cThis letter is to advise you that the \u2018A\u2019 sample urine specimen number 4006253 collected from Tyson Fury on September 22, 2016 in Lancaster, England through his participation in the Voluntary Anti-Doping Association program has been analysed for anabolic agents, diuretics, beta-2 agonists, stimulants and drugs of abuse.

The most astonishing finish to the most important game of the season was scarcely believable: Salford, behind by eight points with around 100 seconds left on the clock, were dead and buried and were on course for the Championship. Hull&#xa0;KR were safe and Super League survival seemed a certainty.</p> <p>At that point, Salford\u2019s players appeared to have accepted their fate: hands on their hips, on the verge of giving up. Yet five minutes later they were running around the field celebrating victory in the most incredible culmination to a rugby league game.</p> <p>Niall Evalds\u2019 try in the corner to make it 18-14 with two minutes remaining seemed nothing more than a consolation. Salford had no chance of scoring again, surely? Fifty-three seconds remained when they got the ball again and after Josh Griffin \u2013 who put Evalds away for his try \u2013 broke in midfield; Salford kept their cool, shifted the ball the width of the field and Greg Johnson touched down on the right wing.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a8f95e66df45bea10bcef104f8e3ba6e988b786e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a8f95e66df45bea10bcef104f8e3ba6e988b786e/0_42_4557_2734/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Marwan Koukash\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Salford Red Devils owner Marwan Koukash during an interview after the match.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ed Sykes/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The only time KR touched the ball again was when they kicked off in extra time.

Unpleasant crowd troubled marred the end of what was a superb spectacle for the sport before that; the RFL later confirmed it will launch an investigation into the matter.</p> <p>A statement said: \u201cGames with so much at stake often mean emotions run high, but that does not excuse the minority of fans who behaved unacceptably following the final whistle. The RFL will conduct a full investigation into these incidents and will work with the police and club involved to ensure anyone found to have acted violently is dealt with appropriately and also banned with immediate effect.\u201d</p> <p>For Hull KR, there will be no Super League for them next year \u2013 and no Hull derby: a blow for the competition as a whole. \u201cThere\u2019s a debate for another day about whether that\u2019s correct but this club has 50 people walking out of this ground not knowing if they\u2019ve got a job,\u201d said the Hull KR coach, James Webster. \u201cThe boys put every single thing they had into it, and it was one of the better games you\u2019ll see. I just can\u2019t fathom this whole situation, to be honest.\u201d</p> <p>KR were magnificent in the opening quarter and they led 10-0 courtesy of tries from Adam Walker and Josh Mantellato. Playing with more energy and enthusiasm than the Red Devils, the home side appeared in complete control but their failure to score a third try afforded Salford the chance to respond before half-time.</p> <p>Tries from Evalds and Ben Murdoch-Masila made it 10-10 and, although Mantellato kicked a penalty on the half-time hooter, the game was still firmly in the balance.</p> <p>When Mantellato converted Thomas Minns\u2019 try to open up an eight-point lead, Rovers appeared in control and seemed destined to see the game out untroubled. Then, from nowhere, Evalds touched down after Griffin\u2019s imperious offload and the late drama truly began.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve never seen anything like it,\u201d said the Salford coach, Ian Watson. \u201cWe sent a call out with five minutes to go; we were under the pump defending our line but we told them to believe.

Here are five topics likely to be on the agenda.</p> <h2><strong>Brexit and other threats to the global economy</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4cc4997a6e3776a3fa9b7a2761dc6fa3b950e697\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4cc4997a6e3776a3fa9b7a2761dc6fa3b950e697/0_44_3375_2024/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Deutsche Bank.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The IMF will urge a clean-up of the problems besetting Deutsche Bank.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Luke MacGregor/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>While the IMF has revised upwards its short-term forecasts for the UK economy, it remains convinced that the long-term impact will be negative, particularly if Theresa May\u2019s government makes control of migration a higher priority than continued access to the single market.</p> <p>Christine Lagarde, the IMF\u2019s managing director, will urge the Bank of England and the Treasury to continue providing stimulus to the economy, with a warning that there could be fresh turbulence for both the UK and the rest of the EU when, with the triggering of article 50, divorce proceedings eventually start.</p> <p>Even so, having been a cheerleader for what Leave campaigners called Project Fear, Lagarde and her officials will have some explaining to do. Hammond is keen to talk up the prospects for the UK economy and will expect Lagarde to be less pessimistic than she was during the referendum campaign. The IMF can be expected to focus on other worries \u2013 and it has plenty of choice.</p> <p>The IMF\u2019s global financial stability report is likely to highlight the problems of European banks hobbled by hundreds of billions of euros\u2019 worth of non-performing loans. It will be urging a speedy resolution of the problems besetting <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/deutschebank\" title=\"\">Deutsche Bank</a>. It also fears that defeat for Italy\u2019s prime minister, Matteo Renzi, in the referendum on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/06/matteo-renzi-italy-referendum-banks-brexit\" title=\"\">reform of the senate</a> called for December would lead to a political and economic crisis that would have ramifications for the whole eurozone.</p> <p>Other countries being closely monitored by the IMF include the US \u2013 now set to grow more slowly in 2016 than was predicted six months ago \u2013 and China, where the government is trying to rebalance the economy away from its reliance on exports.</p> <h2>Adjusting to the \u2018new mediocre\u2019</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5b6d62d9334bf12753bc64e8c29bb18df77ec4c6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5b6d62d9334bf12753bc64e8c29bb18df77ec4c6/0_294_4992_2996/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Pedestrians walk past an electronics stock display at the window of a security company in Tokyo\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Poor economic performance in Japan, as well as the US and Europe, means world growth is stuck at around 3%.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Toshifumi Kitamura/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Ten years ago, the global economy was growing rapidly. Between 2003 and 2006, global growth averaged more than 5% a year \u2013 the strongest performance since the early 1970s. The IMF\u2019s flagship publication, the World Economic Outlook, could see no reason why the \u201cnew normal\u201d would come to an end and hailed the liberalisation of world financial markets as an unmitigated benefit.</p> <p>Times have changed. The new normal has become what Lagarde describes as the \u201cnew mediocre\u201d \u2013 in which growth remains stuck at barely more than 3% a year, thanks largely to the persistently poor performance of the developed nations: the US, Europe and Japan.</p> <p>\u201cFor the past several years, the global recovery has been weak and fragile, and this continues to be the case today, especially for advanced economies,\u201d <a href=\"http://www.imf.org/en/news/articles/2016/09/27/am16-sp09282016-boosting-growth-adjusting-to-change\" title=\"\">she said in a speech last week</a>. \u201cAnd while there are some good signs, the overall growth outlook still remains subdued.\u201d</p> <p>The IMF\u2019s concerns about Brexit stem, in part, from the knowledge that it would not take much for mediocre growth and low levels of inflation to turn into recession and deflation.</p> <h2><strong>Central banks are out of ammo</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bc0deae97617fe169352d5b9b7117fbeec2a2f6b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bc0deae97617fe169352d5b9b7117fbeec2a2f6b/0_0_4096_2458/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Janet Yellen federal reserve\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">There is speculation that the US Federal Reserve will raise interest rates before the end of the year.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jim Lo Scalzo/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Global growth has been weak despite the best efforts of central banks. They have cut interest rates to record low rates and made repeated use of the money-creation process known as quantitative easing in an attempt to boost demand.</p> <p>This week\u2019s meeting take place against a backdrop of growing speculation that the US Federal Reserve will raise interest rates before the end of the year. But other central banks \u2013 the Bank of England, the Bank of Japan and the European Central Bank \u2013are moving in the opposite direction and providing additional stimulus.</p> <p>Lagarde has maintained a neutral position on a rise in US interest rates, but is known to fear the volatility a rate rise could bring \u2013 as money held in developing world banks, and even in London and Frankfurt, flows to the US in search of a safe return at a higher rate. She also thinks central banks are being asked to do too much, and that achieving higher levels of growth will require a three-pronged approach: monetary stimulus, tax cuts or spending increases from finance ministries, and structural reform.</p> <p>The IMF has urged countries which have the financial headroom to do so to spend money on growth-boosting public investment. <a href=\"http://www.imf.org/en/News/Articles/2016/09/27/AM16-SP09282016-Boosting-Growth-Adjusting-to-Change\" title=\"\">In a recent speech</a>, Lagarde singled out Canada, Germany and South Korea as ones with plenty of spare cash. And this comes after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/feb/24/imf-urges-uk-to-ease-austerity-should-economy-slow-further\" title=\"\">an IMF report at the beginning for the year called on the G20 nations</a>, including the UK, US, Mexico and Turkey, to ramp up their outlay on much-needed infrastructure projects.</p> <h2><strong>The ghost of protectionism</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1f594d4fd4678795729d12bd675b954ebf12ef41\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1f594d4fd4678795729d12bd675b954ebf12ef41/0_117_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Donald Trump\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Donald Trump\u2019s anti-free trade rhetoric is an alarming sign of moves towards trade barriers.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Brendan Mcdermid/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The IMF was born out of the turmoil of the 1930s, when tit-for-tat protectionism amplified the effects of the Great Depression. Since its creation at the Bretton Woods conference in 1944, the IMF has been at the forefront of attempts to reduce barriers to trade. It now views with alarm the ebb tide of globalisation, seen in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/20/trump-clinton-free-trade-policies-tpp\" title=\"\">anti free-trade rhetoric of Donald Trump</a>, the stalling of negotiations between Washington and Brussels on the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/ttip\" title=\"\">Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP)</a> and the Brexit vote.</p> <p>The director general of the World Trade Organisation, Roberto Azev\u00eado, will join Lagarde in Washington this week to make the case for freer trade. The concern of both organisations is not just that there has been a gradual rise over the past four years in the number of protectionist measures introduced, but that there is a risk of an anti-trade narrative taking root, which says all the gains from openness are being captured by a tiny global elite.</p> <p>Lagarde says this mood is encouraged by growing inequality, and that tackling the divide between rich and poor would make it easier to negotiate trade deals and for governments to push for other structural reforms.</p> <h2><strong>A new debt crisis</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2ddf3bc558ee963e7e64b4ab8e18468c814282e1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2ddf3bc558ee963e7e64b4ab8e18468c814282e1/0_120_2420_1452/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Children in Luanda\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Angola is one of the countries that has asked the IMF and World Bank for help as growth and commodity prices fall.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Siphiwe Sibeko/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>For the past decade, the activities of the IMF have overshadowed those of its sister organisation, the World Bank, which also holds its annual meeting this week. The focus has been on the problems of the developed world \u2013 the sub-prime crisis, the near collapse of the banks, the threat to the euro and Brexit \u2013 rather than on the world\u2019s poorest countries, many of which had been growing rapidly as a result of booming commodity prices.</p> <p>Many poor countries borrowed heavily on the global capital markets during the good times but are now finding the environment far more hostile. Weak demand in the developed world has led to sharp falls in commodity prices and slower growth in developing countries. The World Bank expects growth in sub-Saharan Africa to be just 1.6% \u2013 the lowest in more than two decades.</p> <p>Angola, Kenya and Nigeria are among countries that have already turned to the IMF and the World Bank for help, and if growth remains weak others are likely to join them.</p> <p>The echoes of another age \u2013 one when the annual meetings were dominated by calls for debt relief \u2013 are getting louder.</p>",
  "<p>He\u2019s jumping without a parachute. After 31 years in the cosy world of John Lewis, the employee-owned department store\u2019s \u00a31m-a-year managing director, Andy Street, is checking out with no payoff in a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/29/tories-choose-john-lewis-boss-as-west-midlands-mayoral-candidate\" title=\"\">bid to become mayor of the West Midlands</a>.</p> <p>It is a mission of passion for the Birmingham-born Street, who is fascinated by politics and has high-profile friends in the House of Commons.</p> <p>The politics, philosophy and economics graduate privately expresses his admiration for London mayor Sadiq Khan, who switched from a high-flying law career to try to bring about real change through politics. Now Street, who will speak at the Tory conference starting in Birmingham , is clearly keen to do the same.</p> <p>But in his bid to become a Tory mayor in a Labour stronghold, Street is also leaving behind a department store heading into stormy waters.</p> <p>Operating profits at the chain, which is regarded as a bellwether for the UK economy, slumped 31% to \u00a332m in the first half of this year as it struggled to adapt to a fast-changing market in which shoppers increasingly expect to buy online for convenient delivery.</p> <p>Street\u2019s lack of pay-off contrasts strongly with the \u00a3<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/apr/22/waitrose-chubby-grocer-lord-price-golden-goodbye-pay\" title=\"\">1.9m golden goodbye cheque collected by his former colleague Waitrose boss Mark Price</a> when he exited - to become a Tory peer and trade minister - earlier this year. One source close to the business said Street\u2019s lack of a payoff could reflect the group\u2019s reluctance for him to leave at such short notice: he will be out of the business on 28 October, just a month after the company confirmed he would be leaving, while Price stayed on for six months after his resignation.</p> <p>But it\u2019s big leap for Street who is thought to be paid around \u00a31.1m a year.</p> <p>In his decade running the department store, Street has overseen major expansion and helped transform its image from a fusty middle-aged brand into Middle England\u2019s favourite shop.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/sep/15/john-lewis-and-next-declare-falling-profits\">Falling profits at John Lewis and Next stoke high street fears</a> </p> </aside>  <p>John Lewis only began advertising on TV the year that Street took over. Now its Christmas ad is a big event attracting millions of hits on social media. The chain also stocks more fashion, launching own labels with appeal to a younger audience such as Somerset by Alice Temperley and Kin.</p> <p>When Street took charge, John Lewis had opened just one store in six years. In his 10 years it has opened seven full-scale department stores, taking the total to 33, as well as 12 smaller \u201cat home\u201d outlets, an airport store at Heathrow and a small outlet in St Pancras International station. Sales have risen 70% to \u00a34.6bn and operating profits have risen 48% to \u00a3250m.</p> <p>It was Street\u2019s decision to maintain staff numbers and concentrate on service during the economic downturn \u2013 when others were cutting costs \u2013 that helped John Lewis win market share from its rivals.</p> <p>John Lewis\u2019s online strategy was kicked off in 2000 when the group bought the UK arm of buy.com. But Street\u2019s enthusiasm for innovation and technology has helped it outperform major rivals Marks &amp; Spencer and Debenhams.</p> <p>More than a third of all its merchandise is now sold online, and sales via the internet rose by 18% in the first half of this year. The business expects more than half of all sales to be online by 2020, and that produces new challenges: sales growth means investing hundreds of millions of pounds in the distribution infrastructure required for home deliveries \u2013 and each item sold online generates less profit because of all that behind-the-scenes work.</p> <p>\u201cThe writing is on the wall for department stores,\u201d says Nick Bubb, an independent retail analyst. \u201cThey have got huge fixed costs. John Lewis has been bucking the trend with its incredible online growth, but it\u2019s not clear that has done anything for profits.\u201d</p> <p>He says Street\u2019s replacement should be a \u201cdifferent kind of guy, who\u2019s good at nitty-gritty focus on profits\u201d.</p> <p>With costs rising, he says \u2013 particularly after the Brexit vote, which has driven down the value of the pound \u2013 John Lewis will have to find cost-cuts that will not hit service. The group has already warned that it is likely to cut jobs over time and a A merger of head office functions with Waitrose may be on the cards.</p> <p>Most retail watchers expect Street\u2019s successor to be an insider, with retail director Mark Lewis and commercial director Paula Nickolds regarded as the frontrunners. Lewis, who only joined the department store in 2013, has a background at eBay and the parcel delivery company Collect+, both of which sectors are at the heart of the digital future. Nickolds, on the other hand, is a John Lewis \u201clifer\u201d who joined the partnership in 1994 as a graduate trainee, and is regarded as good product and people person.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/apr/25/bhs-marks-and-spencer-john-lewis-department-stores\">If BHS can fold, then how safe are M&amp;S and John Lewis? | Mary Dejevsky</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Whoever takes charge will need a command of online selling and a clear idea of how to keep shoppers coming into the stores, where sales are falling.</p> <p>The new boss may also need to take tough decisions on development plans. The new Waitrose boss has already ditched plans for new supermarkets as he faces up to the new retail world order. John Lewis is unlikely to close stores in the short term, but will have to think hard about how to use space.</p> <p>\u201cThe real challenge is going to be how to grow the business from this point onwards,\u201d says Maureen Hinton, group research director at retail analysts Verdict. \u201cIt really can\u2019t keep opening stores.

PayPal, for instance, reneged on a promised $3.6bn investment there, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/apr/15/north-carolina-lgbt-law-business-backlash\">Deutsche Bank canceled plans to hire 250 people </a>in North Carolina in 2017.</p> <p>A group of about 100 major companies urged North Carolina Governor Pat McCrory to repeal the law, a number that eventually swelled to more than 180, including Apple, Airbnb, Bank of America, Starbucks and United Airlines. They partnered with the transgender advocacy groups <a href=\"http://www.hrc.org/press/pressure-builds-in-north-carolina-as-more-executives-from-major-companies-c?xid=nl_raceahead\">Human Rights Campaign and Equality NC to sign a widely shared letter </a>stating that laws like HB2 \u201care bad for our employees and bad for business\u201d.</p> <p>It\u2019s not unusual for companies to take a stance on controversial social issues. Back in 1993, the National Football League <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2014/02/24/what-does-the-nfl-have-to-do-with-arizonas-bill-letting-businesses-refuse-service-to-gay-people/?utm_term=.8c8d365250fd\">refused to hold the Super Bowl in Tempe, Arizona</a>, because the state would not honor Martin Luther King Jr with a holiday.</p> <p>But North Carolina\u2019s legislation appears to have drawn a much more fierce response from a wide range of businesses. The same can\u2019t be said for other divisive issues such as the right to vote and abortion. Since when have so many companies been such vocal supporters of transgender rights? How did the private sector become so activist?</p> <p>Deena Fidas, director of the <a href=\"http://www.hrc.org/hrc-story/workplace-project-internship\">workplace equality program at the Human Rights Campaign</a>, said the transgender issue is benefiting from a long held recognition by businesses that protecting their gay, lesbian and bisexual employees from discrimination directly affects their ability to attract talent and make money.</p> <p>\u201cThey were saying it was both the right thing to do, and also it was the right thing for their businesses,\u201d said Fidas, who called 2011 \u201cthe tipping point\u201d in terms of companies getting vocal in support of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) people.</p> <p>But behind closed doors, the Fortune 500 actually has a track record of working with LGBT rights groups. During the 1990s and 2000s, before <a href=\"http://www.pewforum.org/2016/05/12/changing-attitudes-on-gay-marriage/\">the tide of public opinion had fully turned in favor of same-sex marriage rights</a>, LGBT employees began forming working groups at their companies to seek same-sex partner benefits, diversity training programs and LGBT anti-discrimination policies at their offices. After a while, companies realized that if they wanted to attract and retain the best employees, they\u2019d better step up.</p> <p>\u201cFor businesses, matters of LGBT inclusion are very tied to their business goals,\u201d said Fidas. \u201cWe have been working with businesses going on two decades.\u201d</p> <p>Still, taking a public stand on LGBT rights didn\u2019t happen quickly. Less than five companies spoke out publicly in opposition of California\u2019s Proposition 8, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/feb/07/prop-8-california-gay-marriage-ban-struck-down\">a 2008 ballot amendment that defined marriage as a union between a man and a woman</a>, which was eventually overturned.</p> <p>But by 2011, when New York state was considering same-sex marriage, the leaders of more than two dozen major companies <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/29/nyregion/gay-marriage-gets-backing-from-new-york-business-leaders.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss\">including Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, supported the state\u2019s proposed Marriage Equality Act</a>.</p> <p>North Carolina became ground zero for the transgender bathroom debate because it was the first state to pass the law in March of this year. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/may/18/transgender-bathroom-bill-texas-north-carolina-obama\">Other states </a>that have considered similar legislation within the last few years included Florida, Texas and Minnesota. North Carolina\u2019s law also bars local authorities from floating any anti-discrimination protections for LGBT residents, which US Attorney General Loretta Lynch denounced as \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/may/10/us-justice-department-sues-north-carolina-over-transgender-law-video\">state-sponsored discrimination</a>\u201d.</p> <p>Fidas is director of HRC\u2019s Corporate Equality Index (CEI), an annual survey of more than 1,200 major companies that launched back in 2002 in order to catalogue what kinds of employment benefits and workplace inclusion policies were available for LGBT workers. Not only do the majority of the companies polled by CEI now offer same-sex partner benefits to employees, but more than 500 companies now offer at least one health care plan that includes appropriate coverage for transgender employees, <a href=\"http://www.hrc.org/press/hrc-releases-first-corporate-equality-index-to-rate-global-lgbt-workplace-i\">according to the 2016 CEI survey.</a> And 75% of Fortune 500 companies have anti-discrimination policies that include gender identity, up from just 3% in 2002.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2015/mar/05/transgender-fear-workplace-business\">Transgender: is there still fear in the workplace?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cIf you look at the advancement of the rights in Fortune 500 companies compared to [LGBT] rights in the states, Fortune 500 companies were way more progressive than the states or any of the governments were,\u201d said <a href=\"http://www.kellogg.northwestern.edu/faculty/directory/king_brayden.aspx\">Brayden King, a management and organizations professor at Northwestern University\u2019s Kellogg School of Business</a>.</p> <p>King, whose research focuses on the way activists influence corporate social responsibility and legislation, says that executives are increasingly taking stronger public stances on issues such as climate change and LGBT rights.</p> <p>\u201cBusiness leaders are standing up and recognizing that they have to fill the void that\u2019s being left in many places and many states by state policymakers,\u201d he said. \u201cMany of those companies and executives feel morally that it\u2019s bad for our culture to discriminate. I really believe that. But these are also executives who have to consider the economic impact of what they do.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1525/sp.2011.58.4.491?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents\">In King\u2019s 2011 study</a> of some 133 different boycotts that occurred between 1990 and 2005, he discovered that a boycotted <a href=\"http://www.kellogg.northwestern.edu/news_articles/2011/boycotts.aspx\">company\u2019s stock price would fall an average of 0.7% for each day it made national media headlines</a>.</p> <p>In other words, the concern about being boycotted \u201cisn\u2019t that it hurts revenues or sales,\u201d King said. Rather, it\u2019s about reputation. \u201cCompanies care so much about reputation because it\u2019s really hard to put a dollar value on how people perceive you. We do know that if people perceive you badly, it can take years and years and years [to dispel that].\u201d</p> <p>Likewise, in the case of North Carolina and HB2, King says: \u201cPeople will remember North Carolina for years after this has settled down as the state that has been associated with this controversy. They could change tomorrow, but people will still associate it with this discriminatory action it decided to take.\u201d</p> <p>He added, \u201cThe boycott becomes a permanent part of that state\u2019s narrative history, and that is fundamental to the reputation that that state has.\u201d</p> <p>Indeed, years after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/us-news-blog/2012/aug/03/chick-fil-a-kiss-in\">same-sex couples and supporters staged \u201ckiss-ins\u201d outside Chick-fil-A restaurants across the country </a>in protest of the company\u2019s vocalized opposition to gay marriage, Chick-fil-A CEO Dan Cathy expressed some regrets.</p> <p>\u201cConsumers want to do business with brands that they can interface with, that they can relate with,\u201d he <a href=\"http://www.myajc.com/news/business/cathy-seeks-to-put-gay-marriage-flap-behind-chick-/nfCHj/\">told the Atlanta Journal-Constitution in 2014</a>. \u201cAnd it\u2019s probably very wise from our standpoint to make sure that we present our brand in a compelling way that the consumer can relate to.\u201d</p>",

  "<p>There was plenty to smile about for J\u00fcrgen Klopp in the end as his team climbed to second in the table on the back of a fourth successive Premier League victory, yet the Liverpool manager made no attempt to sugarcoat a first-half performance that prompted the temperature to rise in the visitors\u2019 dressing room at the interval.</p> <p>Whatever Klopp said at half-time \u2013 the German admitted he was \u201cvery angry\u201d \u2013 it did the trick as Liverpool, who were unrecognisable from the team that toiled in the opening 45 minutes, turned this game on its head to condemn Swansea to a defeat that leaves Francesco Guidolin clinging to his job.</p> <p>James Milner delivered the crucial blow six minutes from time with his fourth penalty of the season, after Roberto Firmino had equalised early in the second half, and from that point on it was tempting to wonder what was going through the minds of Steve Kaplan and Jason Levien, Swansea\u2019s American owners, as well as Guidolin\u2019s.</p> <p>Kaplan and Levien had flown in to watch this match in a visit that had been planned for a while but which took on far greater significance amid the speculation about Guidolin\u2019s future. Ryan Giggs and Bob Bradley are both on a shortlist as part of a managerial search that has not always been conducted behind closed doors.</p> <p>In fairness to Guidolin, Swansea were excellent in the opening 45 minutes and the Italian, judging from the number of times that his name was chanted, still has the support of a sizeable number of the club\u2019s supporters. Yet the harsh reality is that this was a fifth defeat in seven league games, with Swansea collecting only one point from a possible 18 since winning at Burnley on the opening day. Those are the sort of statistics to worry any Premier League owner, irrespective of the fact that Swansea have played extremely well in patches in their last two fixtures, against Manchester City and now Liverpool.</p> <p>While the visitors were much the better team after the interval, Swansea should have had more to show for their first-half efforts than Leroy Fer\u2019s fourth goal of the season. Borja, the club\u2019s \u00a315.5m record signing, squandered two excellent chances, the second of which came after Fer had put Swansea ahead. Mike van der Hoorn could still have salvaged a point in injury-time but the central defender \u2013 the wrong man in the right place \u2013 sliced wide with the goal at his mercy.</p> <p>It was some turnaround from Liverpool in the second half and strange to reconcile the team that dominated that period with the one that looked so out of sorts early on. Liverpool were so pedestrian in their build-up in the first 45 minutes and seemed to be taken by surprise when Swansea played them at their own game by pressing aggressively all over the pitch.</p> <p>To compound things for Liverpool they lost Adam Lallana to a groin injury early on and Daniel Sturridge was booked for diving. Klopp talked afterwards about how he sensed that his players had lost their discipline and composure, right down to \u201cmoaning about decisions that were absolutely right\u201d.</p> <p>Borja could, and should, have put Swansea ahead after five minutes but the Spaniard, who was totally unmarked as he got in between Jo\u00ebl Matip and Nathaniel Clyne, inexplicably headed over the bar from the edge of the six-yard box. It was a poor miss and there was another to come from the same player in the 26th minute, when he nodded Gylfi Sigurdsson\u2019s free-kick wide of the post.</p> <p>By that stage Swansea were ahead after Fer exposed a familiar weakness in Liverpool under Klopp. Sigurdsson\u2019s deep corner kick was headed back across goal by Borja and Fer, via a slight touch from Van der Hoorn, stabbed over the line. It was the 16th set-piece goal Liverpool have conceded since Klopp took over as manager last October \u2013 only Swansea have shipped more in that period.</p> <p>The second-half, however, was a different story. Liverpool took control of the game and it was no surprise when Firmino levelled. Jordan Henderson lofted the ball back into the area after Philippe Coutinho\u2019s free-kick came back of the wall and Firmino, with the freedom of the penalty area as the Swansea defence pushed out, guided his header into the corner.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8b7ed576c13a500459476ff15584d2c49468b3fd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8b7ed576c13a500459476ff15584d2c49468b3fd/0_499_5083_3050/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Roberto Firmino celebrates scoring the equaliser.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Roberto Firmino celebrates scoring the equaliser.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Julian Finney/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It was now one-way traffic, with Swansea pinned back. Coutinho stroked a lovely effort from the edge of the area inches wide and Sadio Man\u00e9 saw his shot deflected over the bar by Kyle Naughton\u2019s superb challenge as Liverpool continued to press. Swansea looked like they might cling on but with the clock ticking down \u00c0ngel Rangel clumsily bundled into Firmino and Milner made no mistake from the spot. Then came Van der Hoorn\u2019s awful late miss.</p> <p>With that the game was up for Swansea and it remains to be seen if the same is true for Guidolin.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2016/oct/01/swansea-city-v-liverpool-premier-league-live\">Swansea City 1-2 Liverpool: Premier League \u2013 as it happened</a> </p> </aside> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/oct/01/west-ham-united-middlesbrough-premier-league-match-report\">Dimitri Payet magic earns West Ham a point against Middlesbrough</a> </p> </aside>",

Those further back were resigned to handing their recorders to colleagues up front, as the cabin was at full capacity for press \u2013 a sign of both a critical inflection point in the campaign and the race for the White House entering its final stretch.<br></p> <p>Trump is usually the candidate who can be relied upon to reach for a sporting metaphor, but here it was Clinton turning to baseball, comparing herself to the Chicago Cubs superstar Ernie Banks.</p> <p>\u201cHe was so excited about going to play that he\u2019d say, \u2018Let\u2019s play two,\u2019\u201d Clinton said. \u201cSo I\u2019m looking forward to the next debate and then the one after that.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7c3a9aabdcc4d5f9a8bed295f262c659a5cd0316\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7c3a9aabdcc4d5f9a8bed295f262c659a5cd0316/0_115_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Hillary Clinton speaks to reporters aboard her campaign plane before departing for a rally the day after the debate.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Hillary Clinton speaks to reporters aboard her campaign plane before departing for a rally the day after the debate.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Justin Sullivan/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>After fielding a handful of questions about the debate and its pivotal moments, the former secretary of state began to walk away but turned again when asked about Trump\u2019s claim that he had a defective microphone. \u201cAnyone who complains about the microphone is not having a good night,\u201d Clinton deadpanned.</p> <p>It was a marked transformation from just two weeks earlier, when the media was fixated upon Clinton\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/15/hillary-clinton-returns-campaign-pneumonia\">diagnosis with pneumonia</a> and her characterization of half of Trump\u2019s supporters as \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/10/hillary-clinton-basket-of-deplorables-donald-trump\">a basket of deplorables</a>\u201d, an obvious misstep for which she expressed regret.<br></p> <p>It was one of the roughest patches of Clinton\u2019s nearly 15-month campaign and coincided with a series of polls simultaneously showing a tightening race, with Trump taking an advantage in some battleground states.<br></p> <p>Whether 90 minutes at Hofstra University, at the most watched debate in US history, would change the trajectory of the race remained unclear. But the pendulum appeared to swing back in Clinton\u2019s favor, and the Democratic presidential nominee sought to seize the moment in the days that followed.<br></p> <p>\u201cDid anybody see that debate last night?

You know what? I did prepare. And I\u2019ll tell you something else I prepared for. I prepared to be president of the United States.\u2019\u201d<br></p> <p>As she wrapped up the speech and worked the rope line, the familiar lyrics of Katy Perry blared over the sound system: \u201cYou\u2019re gonna hear me roar,\u201d a theme song of Clinton\u2019s campaign. Reporters darted into the crowd, where supporters said they hoped debate night had signalled a turning point with less than six weeks remaining until election day.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Two pieces of good news added to the sense of momentum. First was the news that the conservative editorial board of the Arizona Republic had endorsed Clinton, a groundbreaking moment for a local newspaper that had never chosen a Democrat for president over a Republican since its founding in 1890. Bill Clinton was the last Democrat to carry the state, in 1996 \u2013 but polling shows a tight race between Trump and Hillary Clinton.</p> <p>Moments later, John Warner, a retired Republican senator from Virginia, announced he was also backing Clinton over Trump. The second world war veteran\u2019s support could carry weight within the national security community and military veterans in the vital swing state.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Both endorsements fed into one of Clinton\u2019s core arguments \u2013 that her opponent, in addition to being a divisive figure, was simply unfit to serve as commander-in-chief. <br></p> <p>The following day, Clinton travelled north to another battleground state, arriving in New Hampshire on a blustery autumnal afternoon.<br></p> <p>In the snows of February, she lost the state to Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, triggering an unexpectedly long and bitter Democratic primary. But the two stood side by side on Wednesday, as she drew upon his star power to galvanize young voters with the promise of a debt-free tuition plan.</p> <p>Her audience, a mixture of students and parents concerned with college affordability, responded with enthusiastic applause.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Sanders, who endorsed Clinton in July at a rally also held in New Hampshire, implored those in attendance to understand that the election presented a stark choice.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/sep/28/bernie-sanders-hillary-clinton-new-hampshire-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/554ca\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2758870\"            data-video-name=\"Sanders makes case for Clinton in New Hampshire \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"Reuters\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-57ec31b7e4b07eb0f44b8316\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/09/28/160928sanders_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/09/28/160928sanders.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/09/28/160928sanders_WebM.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/sep/28/bernie-sanders-hillary-clinton-new-hampshire-video\">Sanders makes case for Clinton in New Hampshire</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>\u201cI am asking you here today not only to vote for Secretary Clinton, but to work hard to get your uncles and your aunts, to get your friends, to vote,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cThis election is enormously important for the future of our country. It is imperative that we elect Hillary Clinton as our next president.\u201d<br></p> <p>At the back of yet another gymnasium, this time at the University of New Hampshire, there was a more subtle reminder that the election had entered its final stretch.<br></p> <p>A reporter from a Japanese news outlet had turned her back to the stage. She was filming not Sanders and Clinton, but the dozens of reporters who filled several rows of tables while frantically typing at their laptops and largely ignoring the bags of Greek salads and BLT sandwiches provided by the campaign for a travelling press constantly on the move.<br></p> <p>Many had taken to the crowd in pursuit of young Sanders supporters, seeking to gauge whether the millennial demographic was finally warming to Clinton\u2019s candidacy. Although she leads Trump among young voters, Clinton has continued to struggle with uneven support from those under the age of 30.<br></p> <p>First-time voter Michael Giordano said the debate had helped instill some confidence in Clinton from his perspective. The former Sanders supporter said he was still on the fence, but conceded: \u201cI\u2019m probably going to vote for Hillary Clinton.\u201d<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"clinton sanders instagram\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;instagram-media&quot; data-instgrm-captioned data-instgrm-version=&quot;7&quot; style=&quot; background:#FFF; border:0; border-radius:3px; box-shadow:0 0 1px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.5),0 1px 10px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.15); margin: 1px; max-width:658px; padding:0; width:99.375%; width:-webkit-calc(100% - 2px); width:calc(100% - 2px);&quot;&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;padding:8px;&quot;&gt; &lt;div style=&quot; background:#F8F8F8; line-height:0; margin-top:40px; padding:44.0740740741% 0; text-align:center; width:100%;&quot;&gt; &lt;div style=&quot; background:url(data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAACwAAAAsCAMAAAApWqozAAAABGdBTUEAALGPC/xhBQAAAAFzUkdCAK7OHOkAAAAMUExURczMzPf399fX1+bm5mzY9AMAAADiSURBVDjLvZXbEsMgCES5/P8/t9FuRVCRmU73JWlzosgSIIZURCjo/ad+EQJJB4Hv8BFt+IDpQoCx1wjOSBFhh2XssxEIYn3ulI/6MNReE07UIWJEv8UEOWDS88LY97kqyTliJKKtuYBbruAyVh5wOHiXmpi5we58Ek028czwyuQdLKPG1Bkb4NnM+VeAnfHqn1k4+GPT6uGQcvu2h2OVuIf/gWUFyy8OWEpdyZSa3aVCqpVoVvzZZ2VTnn2wU8qzVjDDetO90GSy9mVLqtgYSy231MxrY6I2gGqjrTY0L8fxCxfCBbhWrsYYAAAAAElFTkSuQmCC); display:block; height:44px; margin:0 auto -44px; position:relative; top:-22px; width:44px;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p style=&quot; margin:8px 0 0 0; padding:0 4px;&quot;&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.instagram.com/p/BK7EhtWgO8c/&quot; style=&quot; color:#000; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; line-height:17px; text-decoration:none; word-wrap:break-word;&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&amp;#34;I&amp;#39;m proud of the primary campaign that Bernie and I ran.

Acknowledging there was work yet to do in order to bring young voters to Clinton, Palmieri pointed not only to Sanders, but also to Barack and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/video/2016/sep/29/michelle-obama-we-need-an-adult-in-the-white-house-video\">Michelle Obama</a> as powerful messengers.<br></p> <p>The first lady had already increased her visibility on the stump after a memorable speech at the Democratic national convention in July. On Tuesday night, the Clinton campaign also rolled out its first television ad featuring Michelle Obama to air in several key battlegrounds.<br></p> <p>\u201cHillary will be a president our kids can look up to,\u201d Obama says directly to the camera. \u201cA president who believes in our kids and will fight for them every day. That\u2019s why I believe in her.\u201d<br></p> <p>The first lady\u2019s appeal could also carry weight with independent-minded and Republican women put off by Trump\u2019s rhetoric toward minorities and women. If in recent weeks Trump\u2019s campaign had sought to soften his image with scripted lines about outreach to African Americans and the rollout of a paid family leave policy, the aftermath of the debate cast a spotlight once more on Trump\u2019s troubled relationship with women.<br></p> <p>In one of the defining moments of the opening debate, Clinton successfully baited the former reality TV star by sharing the story of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/30/donald-trump-alicia-machado-clinton-twitter-unhinged\">Alicia Machado</a>, the winner of the 1996 Miss Universe pageant, whose physical appearance Trump later derided with nicknames such as \u201cMiss Piggy\u201d. Thirty-six hours later, Clinton had refocused on policy at a roundtable on student loan debt, while Trump walked into a feud with Machado by again taking shots at her weight.<br></p> <p>\u201cThe reason we\u2019re talking about Alicia Machado today is because Donald Trump insulted her again yesterday,\u201d Palmeri told the press gathered in Durham, New Hampshire.<br></p> <p>As reporters continued to pepper Palmieri with questions, the staffer tasked with escorting the travelling press from point A to B tried several times to wrap up the discussion or risk being left behind by Clinton and her motorcade. After meeting with Sanders backstage for 15 minutes, the candidate was scheduled to fly to Boston for another fundraiser in another state.<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"64895ae4323b0f1362a578c7833d7f0037902d24\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/64895ae4323b0f1362a578c7833d7f0037902d24/0_113_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Audience members cheer while Clinton speaks at a campaign rally in Raleigh.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Audience members cheer while Clinton speaks at a campaign rally in Raleigh.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Brian Snyder/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The press scurried into a bus, driving past a lonely protest of three voters holding up signs for the Green party candidate, Jill Stein. One banner declared that if there was ever a time to vote for a third party, it was now.<br></p> <p>At her Boston fundraiser, a 66-mile journey from New Hampshire accomplished in a speedy 20 minutes by air, Clinton continued to drive home the point that Trump had shown himself to be \u201ctemperamentally unfit and unqualified to be president\u201d, an aide said.<br></p> <p>Another short flight returned Clinton to New York state, where she owns a home in Chappaqua and where she prefers to sleep when not required to remain overnight on the campaign trail. Three states and 600 miles made for one of the lighter days on the trail.</p> <p>The following day would be more gruelling, with a plan to hop from New York to Iowa to Chicago and then Florida. But it arrived with a small boost: polling published since the debate, while not definitive, showed Clinton gaining an edge and key groups such as millennials and women turning in her favor.</p> <p>In another part of New York, the repercussions of the first debate were meanwhile playing out in a decidedly divergent manner: Donald Trump was tweeting his rage at the former beauty queen Machado and railing again at Crooked Hillary and the \u201cVERY dishonest media\u201d.</p>",

  "<h2></h2> <p>One of the intriguing points of Monday night\u2019s blockbuster debate was Donald Trump\u2019s nose. He <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/26/trump-sniffles-presidential-debate-clinton-hofstra\">repeatedly sniffled</a> (and drank water), which seemed pretty rich given his assertion that Hillary Clinton lacks stamina. Was he ill? The candidate insisted on Fox News the next day: \u201cNo sniffles, no. You know, the mic was very bad. Maybe it was good enough to hear breathing. There was no sniffles. I have no allergies. No cold. Every once in a while, but no cold.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/27/new-york-debate-drinking-game-trump-clinton-supporters\">'She's debating an idiot': New Yorkers drink and vent for presidential debate</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Perhaps Darth Vader was merely a misunderstood guy because the mic picked up his heavy breathing. These things can matter, as Al Gore knows. The vice-president\u2019s highly audible sigh in the 2000 presidential debate was just possibly the domino that led to the election of George W Bush, which led to the Iraq war, which led to the current mess, which led to Donald Trump. Thus can a sigh or a sniffle sink civilisation.</p> <p>\u2022\u2022\u2022</p> <p>Hitler is having a moment. Making comparisons to the Nazis is often the sign of a losing argument. But credit to the New York Times for its <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/28/books/hitler-ascent-volker-ullrich.html\">review of a Hitler biography</a> that contains some unnerving points without ever mentioning Donald Trump\u2019s name and is all the more powerful for that (after all, the pigs in Animal Farm are not called Stalin and Trotsky).</p> <p>Highlights include: \u201cHitler was often described as an egomaniac who \u2018only loved himself\u2019 \u2013 a narcissist with a taste for self-dramatisation and \u2026 a \u2018characteristic fondness for superlatives\u2019\u201d; \u201cHitler was known, among colleagues, for a \u2018bottomless mendacity\u2019 that would later be magnified by a slick propaganda machine that used the latest technology (radio, gramophone records, film) to spread his message\u201d; \u201cHitler increasingly presented himself in messianic terms, promising \u2018to lead Germany to a new era of national greatness\u2019, though he was typically vague about his actual plans\u201d; \u201cEarly on, revulsion at Hitler\u2019s style and appearance \u2026 led some critics to underestimate the man and his popularity, while others dismissed him as a celebrity, a repellent but fascinating \u2018evening\u2019s entertainment\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>Just coincidence, then, that Barack Obama should make a Hitler reference of his own at a White House ceremony for the US Olympic and Paralympic teams. Noting the presence of relatives of Jesse Owens and 17 other African American athletes who competed at the 1936 Olympics in Berlin, <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2016/09/29/remarks-president-welcoming-2016-usa-olympic-and-paralympic-teams\">the outgoing president said</a>: \u201cIt wasn\u2019t just Jesse. It was other African American athletes in the middle of Nazi Germany under the gaze of Adolf Hitler that put a lie to notions of racial superiority \u2013 whupped them \u2013 and taught them a thing or two about democracy and taught them a thing or two about the American character.\u201d</p> <p>Trump: come 8 November, beware a whupping.</p> <p>\u2022\u2022\u2022</p> <p>Spotted on the menu at the new <a href=\"http://www.trump.com/hotel-collection/washington-dc/trump-intl-hotel\">Trump International Hotel</a> in Washington: \u201cThe Benjamin beer silver bucket, unlimited Amerrica beer.\u201d</p> <p>Make Amerrica great again.</p> <p>\u2022\u2022\u2022</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.gingrichproductions.com/\">Newt Gingrich</a>, former House speaker and Clinton foe, was at the Kennedy Center with his wife, Callista \u2013 a chorister \u2013 to watch Mozart\u2019s opera The Marriage of Figaro last weekend.

Instead, he employs a second \u201cchase plane\u201d for the media. Time magazine\u2019s Zeke Miller has anointed it First Amendment One, a reference to the US constitutional measure that protects freedom of the press.<br></p> <p>The arrangement enables Trump to continue to enjoy his own private plane, which he flies largely at taxpayer expense since it transports his secret service detail. On at least one occasion, it has kept reporters from making it to a Trump rally in time to hear him start speaking. The Republican nominee used the absence of the reporters, many of whom have been following him for more than a year, as an opportunity to mock them.</p> <p>Not all reporters on \u201cFirst Amendment One\u201d relish the nickname.

  "<p>Splash! There\u2019s a ripple on the water and I grapple with my camera to focus on the river. An otter-sized ripple is radiating out across the current. But it turns out to be from a fluorescent stick that\u2019s been tossed into the river and is now being chased by a swimming dog. I lower my camera. Even at 7am, dog-walkers are a ubiquitous hazard for anyone wanting to capture British wildlife.</p> <p>In another life, perhaps I would have had a double-barrelled surname and swaggered across the savannah in khaki, paying off my mortgage with a single photograph of a lion mauling a wildebeest. It\u2019s never too late to pursue your dreams, though \u2013 and that\u2019s why I\u2019m hunched by a Suffolk riverbank with a malfunctioning camera, failing to photograph an otter and instead capturing a blurry image of a dog.</p> <p>I\u2019m getting tips from David Tipling, who is not a posh savannah-swaggering type, but an acclaimed photographer who has travelled the world in pursuit of rare birds. Tipling also offers one-to-one tuition, and close encounters with real wildlife. We meet at 7am by the River Little Ouse in Suffolk to look for otters. Tipling keeps it simple: with tiny binoculars around his neck and a Nikon with a 600mm telephoto zoom, he moves unusually quietly through the countryside. Fieldcraft, as well as technical know-how, is essential in wildlife photography \u2013 and few of us have it since we don\u2019t spend enough time outdoors. \u201cI call it the three Ps,\u201d says Tipling. \u201cYou need patience, perseverance and planning. If you\u2019re at the wrong time of day, or wrong time of year, you\u2019ll miss the wildlife.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a6fc9403cf2cc7a59efd3b960f50783de315f1d0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a6fc9403cf2cc7a59efd3b960f50783de315f1d0/0_0_2592_3888/667.jpg\" alt=\"David\u2019s verdict on Patrick\u2019s shot \u2026 \u2018This has nice light and the poses are good.

While there\u2019s only a 50/50 chance of finding one, once you do they are surprisingly easy to follow, providing you move quickly ahead the moment they dive underwater.</p> <p>The elusiveness of most creatures is one reason why many keen photographers go on a course with a professional. Tipling may have travelled the world taking shots to illustrate Birds &amp; People, Mark Cocker\u2019s majesterial book from 2013, but he also knows exactly where to find a barn owl in Norfolk, and he has a special trick (I could tell you, but then I\u2019d have to kill you) to get close to wild hares.</p> <p>Unfortunately, even Tipling fails to turn up any otters during two hours of lovely riverside walking. We do enjoy seeing five kingfishers darting across the water, however. But these are gone in a flash \u2013 even Tipling doesn\u2019t attempt to photograph them.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"3263a676efc7582f97116e5f6d39d31132047702\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3263a676efc7582f97116e5f6d39d31132047702/0_130_3888_2333/1000.jpg\" alt=\"David\u2019s verdict \u2026 \u2018A very good picture by Patrick: good composition against the water, with strong eye contact\u2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">David\u2019s verdict \u2026 \u2018A very good picture by Patrick: good composition against the water, with strong eye contact\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Patrick Barkham</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Have you ever admired a lovely shot of a kingfisher perched on a bare branch, silver fish in beak? Well, it was almost certainly set up. To photograph a kingfisher, Tipling says, you need to prepare a riverside branch, removing other branches so there\u2019s no visual clutter, then build a shelter to conceal yourself. You may also need bait.</p> <p>In fact, many amazing wildlife shots are created with a surprising amount of human intervention. So for our next lesson, we head to a Norfolk wood where Tipling has built a hide with special one-way glass imported from Barcelona. With the help of a feeder cleverly concealed behind an old oak stump, he has photographed sparrowhawks, green and greater-spotted woodpeckers, rare woodcocks and dozens of forest birds, not to mention stoats, squirrels, badgers, buzzards and red kites.</p> <p>We sit, concealed, on comfortable chairs and talk technology. Keen amateurs are sometimes said to have \u201call the gear and no idea\u201d. I\u2019ve just got no idea. In the decade since I bought a basic Canon digital single-lens reflex (one of those \u201cproper\u201d cameras where you look through the lens to take a shot) I\u2019ve specialised in mediocre pictures on automatic settings. I don\u2019t know what half my camera buttons do.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fcd8546c6306510a4373a467d5c3336ac8b152fa\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fcd8546c6306510a4373a467d5c3336ac8b152fa/0_0_3888_2592/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The verdict \u2026 \u2018I like this, but a professional might have focused more on the water and less on the clouds, leaving something to the viewer\u2019s imagination.

Many keen amateurs purchase a basic telescopic zoom lens for \u00a31,000. But there is secondhand kit and it\u2019s possible to innovate cheaply: for his aerial work, instead of a drone Tipling attaches a \u00a3150 camera to a kite.</p> <p>The big revelation is to be shown <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2012/nov/16/photography-camera-tips\">features my own camera has</a> that I never knew existed. There\u2019s a \u201cdepth of field\u201d preview button so I can see what will be in focus before I take a shot. Tipling explains white balance (just keep it set to automatic), quiet shutter mode (a normal shutter click can spook a barn owl \u2013 Tipling recommends allowing a barn owl to fly as close as possible before taking that first photo) and the importance of technicalities such as Adobe RGB (the amount of colour information stored on a picture file). We also change my ISO setting from 100 to 800, which enables faster shutter speeds in lower light to better freeze movement.</p> <p>We examine a photo of a swan I took that morning. My automatic light settings overexposed the white bird against the dark water. Relying on automatic settings is too crude for most wildlife photography: Tipling sets his shutter speed and aperture manually. If I had done the same, I could have underexposed the photograph, making it darker, and thereby revealing the beautiful detail of the swan\u2019s feathers.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"40677c627c04ba047c0c41fa1f601cce0d6283a3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/40677c627c04ba047c0c41fa1f601cce0d6283a3/0_325_4921_2953/1000.jpg\" alt=\"David\u2019s swan and, below, Patrick\u2019s\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">David\u2019s swan and, below, Patrick\u2019s</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Tipling</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"25023a7e8ad40930a34aecef62e6c27a0d328917\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/25023a7e8ad40930a34aecef62e6c27a0d328917/0_174_3888_2333/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The pro\u2019s verdict \u2026 \u2018The automatic settings have made Patrick\u2019s swan overexposed.

The quicker the shutter speed, the more sharply a camera captures movement: 1/1,000th of a second should be enough for a moving bird wing, although big flappy birds such as herons can be photographed in flight at lower speeds. The aperture (f2.8 to f22 on most cameras) sets the depth of field, or how much is in focus (f22 gives the deepest focus but lets in least light). Because Britain is often gloomy, you usually need a low f-stop.</p> <p>This is no bad thing for wildlife photography, though, because a shallow depth of field blurs the background and isolates the subject \u2013 just what we want. Novices are often so focused on their quarry, they don\u2019t pay any attention to what\u2019s behind it. Avoiding placing background tree branches through the head of a bird in the foreground is harder than it sounds. And even if you blur out what\u2019s behind, patches of light can still distract the eye. \u201cI keep backgrounds as clean as possible,\u201d says Tipling.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"a55ca69629618f0680fc733c458e39a3df7b728b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a55ca69629618f0680fc733c458e39a3df7b728b/0_0_2000_2320/862.jpg\" alt=\"David Tipling\" width=\"862\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Out in the field \u2026 David Tipling.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Tipling</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Meanwhile, I snap away at blue tits and great tits, miss a shrew and get a blurry squirrel. While this is unspectacular, it\u2019s a revelation to be so close to nature.

Tipling has checked the tides and we jump creeks and walk a mile across flat sand. On a distant bank lie more than 100 grey and common seals. \u201cThe biggest photographic challenge here is to make order out of chaos,\u201d says Tipling. \u201cYou\u2019ve got a chaotic jumble of bodies lying across the sand and you\u2019re trying to create a picture that takes away that chaos and gives some sort of impact. You\u2019ve got to get in reasonably tight, otherwise you lose the impact of the seals looking at you.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/gallery/2016/aug/31/2016-wildlife-photographer-of-the-year-finalists\">2016 wildlife photographer of the year finalists - in pictures</a> </p> </aside>  <p>We also have a \u201cfieldcraft\u201d challenge: getting closer without disturbing them. \u201cLow and slow\u201d is Tipling\u2019s mantra, and we approach a group of a dozen seals, extremely slowly and at a zig-zagging angle, as if we might be walking past them. I disapprove of disturbing wildlife but by using this approach, which takes a full hour, we get astonishingly close \u2013 and the seals are undisturbed. Tipling advises me to shoot at seal\u2019s eye-level to create a more intimate picture, slowly shifting position to squeeze out distracting lumps of other seals in the background.</p> <p>After a couple of hours, we quietly leave these beautiful beasts.

The \u201crule of thirds\u201d applies well to landscapes and wildlife: 1/3<sup>rd</sup> foreground, 1/3<sup>rd</sup> subject, 1/3<sup>rd</sup> background tends to create a nicely balanced picture.</p> <p>2. Give your subject space to breathe, don\u2019t just plonk it in the centre.</p> <p>3. Focus on the eyes: our eye is drawn to animal eyes in photographs \u2013 if an eye is blurry, it\u2019s rare for a picture to work.</p> <p>4. Check your background: lower your aperture/f-stop to reduce your depth of field and blur distracting backgrounds.</p> <p>5. Even professionals get wonky horizons on their landscapes \u2013 these can be retrospectively straightened with Photoshop or other computer software.</p> <p>6. Dare to go manual: If you want to capture action, go for a high shutter speed; if you desire texture and depth of field, set your aperture at f11 or higher.</p> <h2>The shot that almost sank a plane</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5b36a547929a4d218fce02a68bf949bd61c802cf\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5b36a547929a4d218fce02a68bf949bd61c802cf/0_0_3421_5286/647.jpg\" alt=\"Emperor penguins in Antarctica\" width=\"647\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Emperor penguins in Antarctica</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Tipling</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>David Tipling went to extreme lengths to capture his most popular photograph \u2013 an emperor penguin and its chick. He flew to the Antarctic on a Hercules and camped 400 miles from the south pole before taking two flights in a Twin Otter 2,000 miles to the penguin colony. While camping on sea ice for 10 days, he was caught in a storm that began breaking up the ice. He and his group had to fly up into the blizzard or the plane would\u2019ve been lost. With almost no fuel left, they landed on the Antarctic plateau. He then had to walk ahead of the plane for 13 miles to make sure the ice was safe for it to taxi to the nearest refuelling spot. \u201cIt\u2019s the most fantastic thing I\u2019ve ever done,\u201d he says.</p> <h2><br></h2>",
  "<p>After my daughter Maxine was born in 1981, she was diagnosed with congenital heart disease at about three months. It was a life-threatening disease and I decided to stay at home for a few years, so I could spend as much time with her as possible. I started growing and selling herbs \u2013 I had about 120 of them in the garden. The garden was like an allotment, with greenhouses and vegetables, but not many flowers.</p> <p>I didn\u2019t have any interest in roses then, but one day when Maxine was about seven, she said to me, \u201cMummy, can we move to a house that\u2019s got roses around the door?\u201d I said to her, \u201cWell, I don\u2019t really want to move, but I\u2019ll grow one,\u201d so we planted a climbing rose by the back door \u2013 and it\u2019s still there today. Ten years ago, we built a new house in our garden and moved in there; our current garden is half the size it was.</p> <p>When Maxine passed away in 2012, aged 30, we remembered that she loved roses, so we asked for people to bring one rose to the funeral. Some people brought me rose plants as well, so we started a little garden for her and planted them there, with her ashes. Maxine\u2019s favourite colour was purple, so one friend bought us a rose called <a href=\"https://www.rhs.org.uk/Plants/149530/Rosa-Rhapsody-in-Blue-Frantasia-(PBR)-(S)/Details\">\u2018Rhapsody in Blue\u2019</a>, which is about as close as you can get to purple. Then I cleared my front garden and planted out half a dozen roses, all with lovely perfumes. My mother-in-law died the same year and we inherited the roses from her garden, too. We planted her favourite, <a href=\"https://www.rhs.org.uk/plants/details?plantid=1688\">\u2018Just Joey</a>\u2019, in the front garden, along with her ashes.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/jul/09/me-and-my-garden-rachel-rogers-schools-gardener-liverpool\">Me and my garden: \u2018I quit the rock\u2019n\u2019roll life to spread the grow-your-own message\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It\u2019s been my project since 2012 to transform the whole garden: it\u2019s my passion.

  "<h2>\u2018The ivory ban has made prices high and poaching lucrative\u2019</h2> <p><em>Enrico Di Minin, research fellow in conservation science at the University of Helsinki, and Douglas MacMillan, professor of biodiversity economics at the Durrell Institute of Conservation and Ecology, University of Kent.</em></p> <p>The 1989 UN ban on international ivory trading was supposed to protect elephants. The result has been counterproductive because restricting supply in a time of increasing wealth in Asia has driven up prices, dramatically increasing incentives and rewards for poachers. Since 2008, large-scale elephant poaching has restarted, driven by high prices in Asia.</p> <p>The trade ban is part of a prohibitionist approach that focuses on enhancing law enforcement, while constricting supply by confiscating and destroying ivory. But some of Africa\u2019s biggest range states \u2013 Namibia, South Africa and Zimbabwe \u2013 <a href=\"http://news.nationalgeographic.com/2016/08/wildlife-Namibia-Zimbabwe-ivory-trade-elephants-cites/\">support a legal trade</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--immersive\" data-media-id=\"6945b48482262bcc0bc4b245551820c9209bad82\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6945b48482262bcc0bc4b245551820c9209bad82/0_0_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A Zimbabwe National Parks official inspects the country\u2019s ivory stockpile at its headquarters in Harare\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A Zimbabwe National Parks official inspects the country\u2019s ivory stockpile at its headquarters in Harare.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tsvangirayi Mukwazhi/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The 2009 <a href=\"https://cites.org/eng/news/Current_rules_commercial_international_trade_elephant_ivory_under_CITES_Proposals_CITES_CoP17_200716\">one-off commercial sale</a> of 102 tonnes of stockpiled ivory generated more than $15m that benefitted elephant conservation and local communities. Further such sales were then banned until 2017.</p> <p>Advocates of the prohibitionist approach argue that this one-off sale has led to increased demand for ivory in Asia and, consequently, stimulated poaching levels in Africa. There is no evidence to support <a href=\"https://cites.org/sites/default/files/eng/cop/17/InfDocs/E-CoP17-Inf-42.pdf\">this claim</a> (pdf) despite numerous assertions by animal welfare groups.</p> <p>Rather, the restrictions under which this one-off sale was permitted might have triggered large-scale poaching of elephants. Market speculators, who probably started investing in raw ivory during the <a href=\"http://danstiles.org/publications/ivory/43.Ivory%20Analysis%20Final%20Report%20lo-res%20copy.pdf\">global financial crisis</a>, started stockpiling in anticipation the black-market price would increase because of scarcity during the sale moratorium. Indeed, the <a href=\"http://savetheelephants.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/2014_ChinaConservationChallenge.pdf\">black market price of ivory</a> skyrocketed between 2008 and 2014.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/sep/01/frontline-bloody-battle-save-africa-elephants\">Saving Africa's elephants: 'Can you imagine them no longer existing?'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In pure economic terms, limiting the supply of ivory can have negative consequences for elephant conservation. Supply reduction, by burning ivory stockpiles and implementing sale moratoria when demand for ivory remains unchanged, can drive prices up and escalate elephant poaching. As the market is controlled by criminals and investors who have no interest in conservation and are influenced primarily by price, elephant poaching can be predicted to increase.</p> <p>Despite recent investment in demand reduction in Asia, it is unlikely demand will be driven to zero within the short time frame required to save the species from extinction in the wild. A more practical approach would be to combine demand reduction campaigns with a legal and regulated supply of ivory, which would keep the price of ivory from rising higher and reduce the incentives for gangs to kill elephants. </p> <p>If this doesn\u2019t happen then African countries might choose to withdraw their participation from Cites and decide for themselves what to do with their elephants and other species.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/sep/23/wildlife-trade-summit-is-a-do-or-die-moment-for-endangered-animals\">Wildlife trade summit is a 'do or die' moment for endangered animals</a> </p> </aside>  <h2>\u2018Legal trade backfired badly in 2008.

Alternatively, in a dynamic economic model where demand and supply can change in response to legalisation, poaching may be worsened by legal ivory trade.</p> <p>This can happen in two ways. First, the conspicuous trade of legal ivory could draw new consumers. Individuals seeing ivory promotions on TV or their peers making purchases may become more interested in buying some themselves. But this growing demand might not be satisfied by the legal supply, incentivising more poaching. Second, with more legal ivory in circulation, it becomes tougher for authorities to distinguish legal from illegal ivory, reducing the risk of detection for illegal traders. This makes it possible for illegal traders to supply more illegal ivory.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>As far as we can tell, the legal sale caused elephant poaching rates to rise and stay high.</p> <footer> <cite>Dr Nitin Sekar and Professor Solomon Hsiang</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Which of these economic theories is correct? In most black markets, this is a challenging question as they are almost impossible to observe. But thanks to Cites, we have data stretching back to 2003 that provides a window into the shadowy illegal ivory trade. At 79 large sites in 40 countries across Africa and Asia, Cites collects data on how many elephants are poached and how many died naturally. In a <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/jun/13/legal-ivory-sale-drove-dramatic-increase-in-elephant-poaching-study-shows\">recent analysis</a>, we used these data to see which economic model is right.</p> <p> Using the Cites global poaching data, we examined whether the \u201cone-time legal sale\u201d of ivory to China and Japan caused changes in global markets for poached ivory.</p> <p>What we found surprised us: the sale announcement corresponded with an abrupt, global and lasting 65% increase in poaching. These findings are further supported by reports on the ground. With the new influx of legal ivory, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/02/world/asia/an-illicit-trail-of-african-ivory-to-china.html\">the Chinese government promoted the product</a>, the Chinese media <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://tv.cntv.cn/video/c10330/7e7b5d36d2ba4817a6994b80c5636153\">trumpeted the investment value of ivory</a>, and a Chinese periodical noted that the one-time sale \u201cstimulated new consumption instead of slowing down illegal ivory trades\u201d. A <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/2012/10/ivory/christy-text\">secondary market for legal ivory permits has emerged</a> to help launder illegal ivory.</p> <p>We tested many alternatives to the \u201cdynamic\u201d theories, but none of them could explain the dramatic 2008 increase in poaching. For instance, there was no greater Chinese investment in valuable raw commodities (such as gold) due to the financial crisis. As far as we can tell, the legal sale and the persisting legal markets <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.g-feed.com/2016/09/replytocites.html\">caused elephant poaching rates to rise and stay high</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d1af3b182ec8b7841c7755cf51549ac68c85d5e0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d1af3b182ec8b7841c7755cf51549ac68c85d5e0/0_0_438_512/428.png\" alt=\"Jump in elephant poaching, graph\" width=\"428\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>We can\u2019t know all the intricacies of the ivory black market, but the evidence suggests that the legal sale of ivory in 2008 led to more poaching, not less.

With presidents Barack Obama and Xi Jinping\u2019s <a href=\"http://news.nationalgeographic.com/2015/09/150925-ivory-elephants-us-china-obama-xi-poaching/\">recent promises</a> to enact \u201cnearly complete bans\u201d on trade in ivory, combined with data-driven demand reduction campaigns and law enforcement efforts, there is an unprecedented opportunity to try andto make them work in the east as well.</p> <h2>\u2018Lifting Africans from poverty is the only way to save elephants\u2019</h2> <p><em>Rowan Martin, </em><em>Zimbabwe delegate to the Cites meeting in Johannesburg</em></p> <p>Ivory has been part of Africa\u2019s wealth for centuries, and the colonial powers of the 18th, 19th and early 20th centuries went to war with each other in the attempt to gain control of it.

At the outset, the Malthusian problem needs to be recognised. Some <a href=\"http://databank.worldbank.org/data/reports.aspx?source=health-nutrition-and-population-statistics:-population-estimates-and-projections\">855 million people</a> live in the countries making up the elephant range in Africa, of which 546 million live in the rural areas.

Unless southern Africa can find higher-valued land uses than the present subsistence agriculture and marginal livestock husbandry, disaster appears inevitable. Those preoccupied with Cites trade bans do not see this bigger picture.</p> <p>The incentives needed to ensure a future for elephants outside state protected areas are, first, a full devolution of authority to those on whose lands elephants live to enable them manage the elephants to their own long-term advantage. Second, for the state to actively promote a high value for elephants and remove all restrictive legislation and bureaucracy that creates perverse incentives.</p> <p> An annual budget of $1.5m is required to protect 5,000 elephants in a national park of 10,000km<sup>2</sup>, which can easily be met from the trade in ivory produced from natural mortality and a low level of problem animal control.</p> <p>Cites has had 27 years to assess the efficacy of the ivory trade ban and it is clear to any impartial observer that it has not worked.</p> <h2>\u2018There is no evidence that ivory sales provide any significant benefit for local people or elephants\u2019<br></h2> <p><em>Dr Andrew Seguya, </em><em>executive director, Uganda Wildlife Authority and member of the African Elephant Coalition who have put forward a proposal that would strengthen the ivory ban</em><br></p> <p>Once again, elephants face a threat to their survival from the ivory trade.

It figures: what works in samba, body-wise, might not work in ballet, and Rambert\u2019s dancers are chosen for their different strengths. I sit in on a morning rehearsal in their giant modernist studio on London\u2019s South Bank. They are focusing on barre work and it\u2019s clear that, even at this stage in their careers, some find ballet easier than others. The aim is to harness this diversity \u2013 of technique, but also, importantly, of race. \u201cWe are 41% diverse,\u201d Baldwin explains, \u201cbut that figure often goes unnoticed.\u201d He hopes to better the ratio to 50% by the time he leaves.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"74ec2301de0c4959299de06898beb25d4637332a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/74ec2301de0c4959299de06898beb25d4637332a/765_0_3316_3500/947.jpg\" alt=\"Exclusive shoot of the Ballet Rambert for Guardian Weekend magazine feature celebrating its 90th anniversary.

Hurst grew up in South Africa under apartheid. His grandmother made costumes for the local dance school, and he learned ballet from a teacher who ignored segregation to teach in Gelvandale, a designated \u201ccoloured\u201d area. \u201cBallet was an elitist thing,\u201d Hurst, now 32, tells me. \u201cKids from my background couldn\u2019t afford to do it properly. It\u2019s only recently that people of different colour, shape and background have been able to pursue this sort of career.\u201d With financial help, he came to Rambert at 18, as an apprentice, and lived \u201clike a student \u2013 very happily\u201d. (Rambert is one of the few companies that pays its apprentices.) Baldwin resurrected the 100-year-old Afternoon Of A Faun, scored by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/claude-debussy\">Debussy</a>, especially for Hurst, who went on to win <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/dance-blog/2014/jan/27/national-dance-awards-natalia-osipova-ramberts-dane-hurst\">male dancer of the year in 2014</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"2ee96a0463259b7bdb67c3872118a48ab77b2137\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2ee96a0463259b7bdb67c3872118a48ab77b2137/841_270_3305_3120/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Exclusive shoot of the Ballet Rambert for Guardian Weekend magazine feature celebrating its 90th anniversary.

The victims are, and always will be the most important part of any peace agreement, and they deserve honesty. I live in Medell\u00edn and am not surrounded by the same kind of conflict people from the countryside have been, and still are to some degree, but understand it\u2019s a very complex subject. In some areas living with the Farc meant protection and even development \u2013 they built roads for places forgotten by the government, maybe not for totally altruistic reasons, but still.<br></p> <p>I think we still have a long way to go and I\u2019m afraid there is a big chance most people will vote no in the plebiscite. Many of my acquaintances, colleagues and even some friends don\u2019t agree with the peace process because, to them, it\u2019s a door to impunity and communism, taking us closer to becoming a second Venezuela. The process is by no means perfect, but it is our responsibility to grade it as objectively as possible, to become critics without hate, and to remove disinformation and lies from the debate. </p> <h2><strong>\u2018I can still remember the fear in my mother\u2019s eyes\u2019</strong></h2> <p><strong>Manuel, 26, now in Bogot\u00e1</strong></p> <p>I was born in a small town in the Llanos region, a stronghold of the liberal guerrillas of the 50s. In the 90s, when I was a child, it was taken a couple of times by the Farc \u2013 we lived surrounded by violence. </p> <p>I remember two events clearly: my mother throwing us to the floor to protect us from stray bullets (I still remember the fear in her eyes) when the Farc first took the town, and a couple years later being trapped on a farm we were visiting when they were engaged in combat with paramilitaries really close by. When we were finally able to return to the town everybody thought we had been killed; those days the paramilitary moved and killed as they wished. Even my dog was shot one night.<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"0f1c9d82e6b5be55f206c2a15fec1e99fed80ef2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0f1c9d82e6b5be55f206c2a15fec1e99fed80ef2/0_2_1642_985/1000.jpg\" alt=\"This 1999 picture shows the coffin of one of 58 soldiers killed in clashes with the Farc guerrilla in Florencia, 530 kms (330 miles) south of Bogota.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">This 1999 picture shows the coffin of one of 58 soldiers killed in clashes with the Farc guerrillas in Florencia, 530km south of Bogot\u00e1.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Pedro Ugarte/AFP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>My family have been lucky enough not to be direct victims, but I had a classmate whose father was killed when paramilitaries drove a car over his chest. Our maid had a small farm with cows. When they did not pay the tax, her husband was killed in front of their house. <br></p> <p>We got used to it, we lost all empathy. For us a massacre in one faraway town was like a weather report, just routine. I don\u2019t live there anymore, nor do my family, but I have experienced directly what many in the big cities haven\u2019t. That lack of experience is why some of them don\u2019t care.</p> <p>The agreement is not going to end the conflict; we still have different agents in play here and I am really worried about violent rightwing groups. It is also hard to believe that suddenly everything in rural areas is going to be peaceful and safe without investment in infrastructure and basic services. I\u2019m sceptical about the future, but ultimately we have nothing to lose in trying this approach.</p> <h2><strong>\u2018I want peace but not at this cost\u2019<br></strong></h2> <p><strong>Anonymous, 55, Cali</strong></p> <p>I feel angry and heartbroken because I know this is a way for the Farc to be free from punishment. They were so close to being defeated because of the policies of former president \u00c1lvaro Uribe and I believe this was why they decided to go in for peace talks. I worry that because they are so wealthy through drug trafficking, the Farc will have enough money to campaign and get into power.<br></p> <p>We have survived 52 years of civil war, and we are a country of positive and hard-working people. Why should we have to let the Farc criminals free while normal Colombians who are in prison for minor crimes have to serve many years? The drug dealers and terrorists of the Farc are being paid and praised like Hollywood stars for all the crimes they have committed against humanity. <br></p> <p>My family feels very insecure because our location is going to see an increase of guerrillas living in our areas; I don\u2019t have hope for Colombia. Criminals will always be criminals, the only difference is that now they are white-collar criminals. We need to renegotiate the deal on offer. I want peace but not at this cost.</p> <h2>\u2018We love our country more than we hate Farc\u2019</h2> <p><strong>Jorge Pati\u00f1o, 39, Bogot\u00e1<br></strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"9f6f93a577938e8c7e040fcac8d3a702e5d0cd87\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9f6f93a577938e8c7e040fcac8d3a702e5d0cd87/0_0_1280_960/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jorge Patino with his wife Ana Mari\u0301a\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jorge Patino with his wife Ana Mari\u0301a</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jorge Patino</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I feel optimistic about our future. No peace deal is perfect anywhere. Justice \u2013 in the traditional sense \u2013 is next to impossible, but it can be achieved in different ways. We\u2019re amputating Farc\u2019s armed hand through negotiation, not violence, and that\u2019s no small feat. Now, they\u2019ll have to learn how to use their non-shooting hand to do things peacefully. <br></p> <p> We\u2019ll also have to take proper care of the victims and give them the respect and truth they deserve, though \u2013 that is also part of justice. </p> <p>We don\u2019t like the Farc, not one bit, but we love our country more than we hate them and, for the sake of Colombia, we\u2019ll give them the chance to act according to the law. We need to relearn as a society how to live with them and they\u2019ll have to learn how to live under the rule of law. The biggest challenge of all will be a cultural one. We have to change our mindset from one of fear and anger to one of planning, caring, listening and forgiving.</p> <h2>\u2018We have a long way to go, but still, I am hopeful\u2019</h2> <p><strong>Mar\u00eda-Victoria Mej\u00eda, 72, near the town of Paipa, Boyac\u00e1</strong></p> <p>I live on a small farm in central Colombia. I shall not be around by the time changes we expect from the peace process become real, but I am hopeful younger generations will do their best to get the most out of the chances they have for a better tomorrow. I hope they commit to successful implementation of all that is spelled out in the agreements. <br></p> <p>Things shall only change, though, when political leaders, the business sector, the legal system, etc, change their ways \u2013 when corruption, exploitation of others and the lack of opportunities are obliterated from everyday life. There is no doubt things shall still be rough in the near future, for 25 years, at least. There are so few opportunities for poor people to get educated, to get out of poverty, to be treated as equals by their fellow citizens, to not be discriminated against on account of their race, colour or place in the society. We have a long way to go, but still, I am hopeful. <br></p> <h2><strong>\u2018The real victims are showing us how forgiveness can change a country\u2019<br></strong></h2> <p><strong>Juan, 29, now living in Scotland</strong></p> <p>I am not only happy, but proud. When I left Colombia to study abroad peace talks were just beginning and I was listening to the same old rhetoric from the Farc, leaving not much space for hope of a successful deal in the future.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/27/colombia-farc-peace-deal-resounds-homeland-uribe\">'The horrible night has ceased': Colombia peace deal resounds in Farc's heartland</a> </p> </aside>  <p> Today, the situation is completely different. The peace negotiations have been able to tackle some of the most endemic problems of Colombian society, and have also opened the door for a bright future in which we can start thinking about the real problems of a developing country rather than spending most of our time and thoughts on war. This opens opportunities for rural areas, but also for urban citizens who might develop businesses based on the strengths of Colombia\u2019s rich nature and diverse landscapes.</p> <p>I think civil society and also the newly incorporated former guerrillas will take some time to accommodate to this new reality. However, the biggest challenge is for politicians to react to a country that wants to leave war behind and focus on developing the best conditions for its people. <br></p> <p>I have been very fortunate to live a life that has not been directly affected by war, and it seems to be that some other people in my position are the ones opposing the peace agreement. The real victims on the other hand <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/29/colombia-farc-peace-deal-vote\">are promoting the yes vote</a> and showing us how forgiveness can change a country.</p> <h2>\u2018We shouldn\u2019t have to explain to our children why we are killing each other\u2019</h2> <p><strong>Juan, 26, Bogot\u00e1 </strong><br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"af6153f6570fdef359ff13e8a3a0d0c4bfe8bd98\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/af6153f6570fdef359ff13e8a3a0d0c4bfe8bd98/0_203_4664_2798/1000.jpg\" alt=\"People gather at Bogot\u00e1\u2019s main square to celebrate the historic peace agreement.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">People gather at Bogot\u00e1\u2019s main square to celebrate the historic peace agreement.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Guillermo Legaria/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Today I live in Bogot\u00e1, but I\u2019m originally from a smaller city, Cali. The peace deal represents the hope for me and my people that we may finally be able to break from the horrors of our past, and be able to move forward as a single, united and peaceful nation. <br></p> <p>I strongly support the deal, even if it is not perfect. We have already suffered enough. Since I was a child, I remember the fear whenever we took a road trip with my family anywhere. Going outside the city, even 5km outside, was always a tense and fearful situation. There was always a risk that the Farc would have a surprise roadblock, and they could kidnap people. In my school a student from the year above me was kidnapped from the school bus.<br></p> <p>The war also allowed criminals to exploit the fear of people. They often pretended to be Farc members and demanded money: my father received one of those calls. I remember the day my father told me \u2013 I was roughly 15 and remember sitting in the living room, scared for him, afraid afterwards that every time he went to work something could happen. <br></p> <p>The peace deal for me, my friends and my family means that we no longer have to try to explain our children and adolescents why we are killing each other. Children will no longer have to grow up learning and praying not to have one of their parents or brothers or sisters kidnapped or killed in a senseless inner conflict. <br><br>Hatred and bigotry has become rampant, especially in the last few months building up to the vote. We need to rebuild our social fabric and to learn to understand each other. </p> <h2><strong>\u2018Santos is only thinking about a Nobel prize\u2019<br></strong></h2> <p><strong>Salua, 32<br></strong></p> <p>I believe Santos made this deal thinking of his ego and the Nobel prize. He does not care how he gets an agreement, or what the terms are, or how much money he needs to spend to get people to approve it \u2013 he just wants to be the president that signed the deal for peace. I also believe he has lied to our country, about the terms and about, for instance, places in congress for the Farc, where I fear they will influence voting with violence.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"2a1247b650a0aa1992d206280ac02f3f382ca04e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2a1247b650a0aa1992d206280ac02f3f382ca04e/0_182_2847_1708/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Timole\u00f3n Jim\u00e9nez signs the final peace agreement between the Colombian government and the Farc in Cartagena on 26 Sept.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Timole\u00f3n Jim\u00e9nez signs the final peace agreement between the Colombian government and the Farc in Cartagena on 26 Sept.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jhon Paz/Xinhua/Barcroft Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>My hopes? For real peace, to extradite heads of guerilla groups to the US for at least 20 years. I also hope the UN steps in and blocks the peace agreement.<br></p> <p>We Colombians are very idealistic; we believe in hope and romance, and we are in some sense naive. But, right now I feel sad, impotent and worried. Our institutions are drowned in a sea of corruption, and we are being so woefully accepting that the end justifies the means. <br></p> <h2>\u2018It isn\u2019t a solution, it is a step toward a solution\u2019</h2> <p><strong>William Corcoro, 50, Bogot\u00e1</strong><br></p> <p>It can only be a step in the right direction, whatever the motives behind its various players. To reject it as a poor solution is an error \u2013 it isn\u2019t a solution, it is a step toward a solution, a very important and crucial step. <br></p> <p>I hope this will lead to greater de-urbanisation in Colombia. So many people are unhappy to be living in cities. Colombians need to re-inhabit our own country, to go back to rural areas. So many feel like shipwrecked castaways here in Bogot\u00e1. The landgrab era will end and peace will return, just as it has in most nations of the world before now.</p>",

There\u2019s been so much heartbreak since, from the preliminary final losses of 1997, 2009 and 2010, to the loss of their skipper Bob Murphy to a season-ending knee injury this year. </p> <p>Somehow, putting aside all the baggage of the past and forging something new, they\u2019ve shown that a community-based club with strong values and clear-eyed leaders can taste the ultimate success, and that being fashionable is overrated. What a moment for Luke Beveridge, the coach who arrived in the wake of a 2014 season in which the club shed both its captain and coach and looked lost. Earlier in the week he was named coach of the year by his peers and in ten minutes\u2019 time he\u2019ll walk up on stage and lift a premiership cup.

If you\u2019d tried to bet on this pairing of football sides at the start of the season, not only would the bookies have offered you long odds, they might have inquired as to the state of your wellbeing.</p> <p>But here we are: the glamorous and well-drilled harbourside superstars of the Swans against a Doggies side full of talent and spirit, but representing Melbourne\u2019s working class western suburbs and a group of fans who\u2019ve had to wait entire lifetime\u2019s for this day. Thirty years ago the club was on its knees. They haven\u2019t figured in a decider in 55 years and took their one and only premiership cup in 1954, when Robert Menzies was Prime Minister and Vance Joy was not a combination of words that had ever been used.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5fe98e7a25b3f8135da2b52354586472fb60ce20\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5fe98e7a25b3f8135da2b52354586472fb60ce20/0_0_3000_2000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Bulldogs and Swans fans arrive at the MCG\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bulldogs and Swans fans arrive at the MCG for the 2016 AFL grand final.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Quinn Rooney/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There\u2019s some romance here but also, I fear, perhaps a dose of reality in the next few hours. Am I wrong in thinking that Sydney will hold their nerve and benefit from their previous grand final experience? We shall see, but a bit more on the phenomenon of grand final nerves in the article below, which you can check out before I\u2019m back with today\u2019s teams. In short, the Doggies\u2019 vaunted press meets Sydney\u2019s hard-nosed, hard-ball-winning midfield in a contest between leg-speed and muscle. I\u2019ll stick with the Swans as my tip, but certainly hope it\u2019s closer than my gut feel suggests.</p> <p>Will the weather be a factor today? No, thankfully. It\u2019s 17 degrees in Melbourne, partly cloudy with a light westerly heading towards the Punt Road end, but there\u2019s no rain predicted for the afternoon and the sun should be beating down on the glorious Melbourne Cricket Ground by the time today\u2019s game ends.

  "<p>Western Bulldogs are the 2016 premiers. This statement, so unlikely at so many points of an improbable campaign, is the product of the Bulldogs outlasting the Sydney Swans 13.11 (89) to 10.7 (67) in a pulsating AFL grand final.<br></p> <p>No less than 99,981 fans crammed into the MCG to witness the Bulldogs\u2019 first grand final since 1961 and their first premiership since 1954. It caps the most remarkable of seasons for the club and the competition. From seventh on the ladder and handicapped by a succession of cruel injuries, the Bulldogs have dominated this finals series, riding an unstoppable wave of momentum. </p> <p>Luke Beveridge deserves the highest acclaim. This is his triumph. Beveridge\u2019s ability to channel the energy within his group over the past two seasons and harness the goodwill pouring his club\u2019s way in recent weeks has been a peerless coaching accomplishment. \u201cWe\u2019ve ridden on your wings,\u201d he told supporters from the dais, before draping his Jock McHale medal around the neck of a tearful Robert Murphy. The coach then stood aside to allow Murphy and Easton Wood to lift the premiership cup for only the second time in the club\u2019s history. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2016/oct/01/afl-grand-final-live-blog-sydney-western-bulldogs-mcg\">AFL grand final: Sydney Swans vs Western Bulldogs - live updates | Russell Jackson</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In keeping with the finals campaign, Beveridge masterminded a team victory. Tom Boyd came of age as a power forward, Liam PIcken showed he\u2019s a jack of all trades and master of most and Jason Johannisen, with a team high 33 disposals, took home the Norm Smith medal. But there were contributors everywhere you looked. Easton Wood and Dale Morris spoiled everything in defence. Clay Smith laid 11 tackles. Tory Dickson kicked three goals in a faultless performance in front of goal. You got the feeling Beveridge could throw a guernsey on a member of the cheer squad and they would deliver decisive contribution. </p> <p>There were six lead changes throughout the game, and the margin stood at just one point midway through the final quarter. Each side threatened to run away with it at different points. Only in the closing stages did the Dogs do so, decisively. </p> <p>As magnificent as the contest was, it wasn\u2019t a celebration of precise football. The winning team went inside 50 on 59 occasions for only six marks. Dane Rampe and Heath Grundy snaffled 20 of those between them. But what was lacking in polish was more than made up for in industry. It was a brutal affair for three and a half quarters, but when the late afternoon haze began to shimmer through the MCG it was the Dogs who had the run to kick their way home. </p> <p>The tone was set from the opening bounce and two minutes of preposterous, stoppage-free demolition derby action, with bodies hurled at pace into contact and neither side able to control possession. </p> <p>So hot was the footy, the first goal took 12 minutes to arrive. Luke Parker took the honours but its genesis was one of the great grand final marks by Kieren Jack. Running with the flight towards the arc, the Swans co-captain flew like a cannon ball, secured the grab, and then had the stuffing thumped out of him by Wood\u2019s shoulder. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ff60abcdc7c2f1426e99317fd8dbff6d8f9e882e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ff60abcdc7c2f1426e99317fd8dbff6d8f9e882e/0_0_3000_2000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Footballer Tom Boyd celebrating\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Maligned forward Tom Boyd came of age in the Western Bulldogs\u2019 grand final victory over Sydney, kicking three goals in the Doggies\u2019 drought-breaking premiership win.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Quinn Rooney/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>By this point Lance Franklin had already been off the ground for five minutes after rolling his ankle in a marking contest. Best on ground when these sides met earlier in the season, the injury-blunted the spearhead for the remainder of the game.</p> <p>The Bulldogs took to the first break with a four-point advantage courtesy of goals from Tory Dickson and Zaine Cordy. They should have been further ahead. True to prematch form the balance of play was in Sydney\u2019s defensive territory but the Dogs, so slick by hand, were clumsy by foot. At times they weren\u2019t just missing targets they gave the impression they weren\u2019t even looking for any.</p> <p>Sydney struggled to capitalise on the rebound. As well as Franklin\u2019s issues, Xavier Richards and George Hewett struggled to get into the game and whenever a marking chain threatened, a blue defender left his man to spoil.</p> <p>The first quarter reaped only three goals but it was absorbing and intense. The second belched 11 and will rank among the great quarters in grand final history. </p> <p>Boyd, Picken and Dickson marched the Dogs into a 16-point lead but a sharp snap from the excellent Tom Mitchell jump-started the Swans into action. Gary Rohan kicked the most peculiar goal of the day, the game having stopped for an age with the noise too loud for any player in earshot to hear the umpire screaming that the supposed mark had been touched. </p> <p>All of which was a prelude to the Josh Kennedy show. The Swan turned on beast mode for a passage, kicking two, Sydney\u2019s third and fourth in succession to drag the game their way. By half-time the finals specialist had amassed 22 possessions, two goals, and was a monty for best on ground. </p> <p>What should have been a clear half time lead for the Swans was dragged to just two points in the shadow of the siren, and in controversial circumstances. Jack was incorrectly penalised for kicking in danger and fined 50 metres for dissent. The Swan deserved a free-kick of his own for forceful contact below the knees but his cries fell on deaf ears. Toby McLean held his nerve.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/westernbulldogs/status/782130329574252545\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">&quot;Sons of the West....!!!&quot;<br><br>Premiership style. \ud83c\udfc6 <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/bemorebulldog?src=hash\">#bemorebulldog</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/2BioFOPfap\">pic.twitter.com/2BioFOPfap</a></p>&mdash; Western Bulldogs (@westernbulldogs) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/westernbulldogs/status/782130329574252545\">October 1, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>The third quarter resembled the first, with clear attacking chances at a premium. Dickson and Kennedy exchanged lead changes early on but neither side could break the shackles, setting up a grandstand finale. </p> <p>The finale that began with Daniel Hannebery carried off the ground after his left knee buckled in a ferocious Wood tackle, the latest in a long line of incidents that went against the Sydneysiders. The Bulldogs won the free kick count 20-8. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/gallery/2016/oct/01/afl-grand-final-sydney-swans-vs-western-bulldogs-in-pictures\">AFL grand final: Sydney Swans vs Western Bulldogs \u2013 in pictures</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It was an ominous start, and despite Franklin booting the opening goal of the term, the Bulldogs had the ascendancy. Jake Stringer, a peripheral figure all afternoon, snapped accurately to extend the lead back to seven, and almost as soon as Hewett replied, Picken restored belief.</p> <p>The game was unravelling as a structured contest. Bodies strewn all over the turf, the Sherrin bobbling of its own accord. Through the chaos, Boyd strode like a man with his own forcefield to wallop the sealer.</p> <p>Win or lose there would be Bulldog tears. They\u2019re that kind of a group; it\u2019s been that kind of a year. But when Beveridge and Murphy moved boundaryside two minutes before the final siren, the emotion was already overwhelming. It was as pure a scene as you could design in the heat of battle, capped moments later by the coach\u2019s generosity \u2013 a fairytale ending to a magical story.</p>",
  "<p>People of a certain age remember where they were when they heard that President Kennedy had been shot. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/1966/oct/22/fromthearchive\" title=\"\">Aberfan</a> was my second JFK moment. On 21 October 1966, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2006/oct/22/ameliahill.theobserver\" title=\"\">116 children and 28&#xa0;adults</a> were crushed or suffocated when a coal spoil tip engulfed Pantglas primary school, together with some of the nearby houses, in the village of Aberfan, south Wales.</p> <p>Aged 22, I had just started a post-graduate year at the Royal Academy of Music in London. The tragedy was caused by an accumulation of water that rendered the tip unstable. The official inquiry cited the National Coal Board\u2019s gross negligence and chairman Lord Robens for issuing misleading statements. Parliament subsequently passed legislation to ensure there would be no repeat of such an appalling event. The father of one of the victims requested that the official report would carry the words \u201cburied alive by&#xa0;the National Coal Board\u201d.</p> <p>Two years ago, I was approached by&#xa0;Ian Jones of S4C and Hefin Owen of&#xa0;Rondo Media to compose a work commemorating the 50th anniversary&#xa0;of the disaster.</p> <p>When the word Aberfan is mentioned, no further explanation is necessary; its eternal effect is encapsulated in its name.&#xa0;What resonates, of&#xa0;course, is that the great majority of&#xa0;victims were&#xa0;children.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/greenslade/2006/oct/20/memoriesofaberfanraiseethi\">Memories of Aberfan raise ethical questions</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The catastrophe and its aftermath have been comprehensively documented, but one story still haunts me. A girl, feeling unwell that morning, didn\u2019t attend school and instead spent the day at her grandmother\u2019s house. It&#xa0;was one of those that lay in the path of the avalanche, and she perished. If&#xa0;she had gone to school, she would have been in a section of the building that escaped.</p> <p>One reason for the intensity of feeling in Wales is that it is such a small country. I was raised in Penclawdd, a village on the Gower peninsula, and Aberfan was&#xa0;only 40 miles away; the disaster seemed local.</p> <p>I have been asked where the inspiration comes from in setting about this task. Inspiration is a curious concept, and one with which I am not really in&#xa0;accord. Geniuses such as Bach or Mozart, employed by church or court, had to compose a piece by a given day; the process, if not the quality, is the same for lesser mortals like me.</p> <p>Paradoxically, dealing with a subject that lies so deep in the soul of Welsh people was both a harrowing and an uplifting experience, but the journey was made easier, more rewarding and&#xa0;essentially only possible by my travelling companion, Mererid Hopwood, the brilliant Welsh poet, academic and linguist who has written a remarkable libretto that was the peg on which I hung my musical coat.</p> <p>While the work\u2019s genesis is in Aberfan, we were mindful of how it might encompass other tragedies involving children: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2013/mar/14/dunblane-massacre-scotland-killing\" title=\"\">Dunblane </a>(1996), the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/beslan\" title=\"\">Beslan school siege</a> (2004), the Korean ferry disaster and the<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/dec/19/peshawar-school-massacre-pakistans-911\" title=\"\"> Peshawar school</a> massacre (both 2014).</p> <p>We have all been children, many of us&#xa0;are parents and grandparents, and our hope is that the work encompasses children all over the world, as well as offering a memorial in music for the disaster in Wales. As Mererid says: \u201cWe sincerely hope the work speaks from two hearts to many hearts.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"82760a6f766746842decfeb4a4108db05ab7266a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/82760a6f766746842decfeb4a4108db05ab7266a/0_157_3054_3818/800.jpg\" alt=\"A school classroom in Pantglas primary school.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A school classroom in Pantglas primary school.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bill Orchard/Rex Features</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><em>Cantata Memoria: For the Children/Er Mwyn y Plant</em> is both music and a poem. It is not a documentary, nor even a dramatisation, but it does include a conflation of ideas and facts that are by now part of the legacy. There wasn\u2019t just one cort\u00e8ge (the title of a movement), but we do know that \u201cAll Things Bright and Beautiful\u201d was sung at Pantglas School from time to time. A poignant line in the hymn has sinister ambiguity in our context as the \u201crivers running by\u201d alludes to the hidden river running underneath the village that contributed to the disaster. The Welsh song \u201cMyfanwy\u201d (written by&#xa0;Joseph Parry from nearby Merthyr Tydfil and also quoted) was sung by&#xa0;the soldiers who dug for victims. \u201cMyfanwy\u201d was also the first piece performed by the local Ynysowen Male Choir, formed after the tragedy, and from which the community sought to find some solace.</p> <p>The text is multilingual: English, Welsh and Latin (from the Mass), while&#xa0;also referencing words in many other languages which, it is hoped, symbolise how this memorial is at once&#xa0;both specific and universal.</p> <p><em>Cantata Memoria</em>, sung by Bryn Terfel among others, is in two distinct sections but performed continuously. The first deals with the disaster and its immediate aftermath, and the second moves from darkness to light, reliving memories and celebrating childhood.</p> <p>It is said that no birdsong was heard&#xa0;in the hours before or after the tragedy and so the words \u201clight\u201d and a&#xa0;\u201cbird\u201d provide the textual thread towards the&#xa0;conclusion of the piece; the orchestra concludes with a glistening arrangement of celesta, glockenspiel and various bells to depict \u201clight\u201d, which, quietly spoken by the children and sung by the soprano, brings the canta ta to a close.</p> <p><em>\u2022 Cantata Memoria</em> is released by Deutsche Grammophon&#xa0;on 7 October and will be premiered at&#xa0;Wales Millennium Centre, Cardiff, the following day.&#xa0;<a href=\"http://www.wmc.org.uk/\" title=\"\">wmc.org.uk</a>.</p>",
  "<p>They are known as the eighth-day dogs<strong> \u2013</strong> animals whose fate is about to be decided.<strong> </strong>After seven days in a local authority pound, a lucky stray dog might be taken in by a rehoming centre, from where he may be adopted by a kind new owner. The alternative, however, is far bleaker. The latest results of a <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-37475055\">Dogs Trust annual survey</a> found that 3,463 unclaimed strays \u2013 many of them healthy and happy \u2013 were put to sleep between April 2015 and March 2016.</p> <p>More than 80,000 strays were collected by local council dog wardens in the year up to March 2016, according to the survey. Of those dogs \u2013 who may have escaped from gardens, run off when on a walk or even been stolen and then abandoned \u2013 just over half were reunited with their owners. But 37,283 went unclaimed.</p> <p>Virtually all strays are previously owned, as ownerless dogs are extremely rare in the UK. \u201cWe don\u2019t really have street dogs,\u201d says Lee Paris, campaigns officer for Dogs Trust. \u201cA lot of [those dogs] would have been abandoned pets, but there are cases of dogs escaping and maybe the public being unaware of how to find them.\u201d</p> <p>Local authority dog wardens \u2013 who are usually provided by private companies \u2013 collect a dog after receiving reports that it is a stray. The animal is then is kept in kennels for a minimum of seven days. Kennel conditions vary: some are run by private boarding houses and sanctuaries, but there have also been reports of dogs being housed in council-run pounds with little or no bedding and minimal veterinary care.</p> <p>If it remains unclaimed after a week, says Paris, a \u201cdog becomes the property of the council and they then need to find a new owner, whether by directly rehoming or finding rescue space. We try and take as many as we can, as do other rescue centres across the UK.\u201d If it cannot be placed, though, the dog will be put down.</p> <p>\u201cThe hardest thing is when you go to the stray kennels and you know you\u2019ve only got spaces for two dogs,\u201d says Lauren Sanderson, deputy charity manager, of <a href=\"http://\">Rain Rescue</a>, which rehomes stray dogs and cats in South Yorkshire.</p> <p>\u201cHaving to see all the ones who need your help and you have to leave them behind \u2013 that\u2019s the heartbreak. Those dogs don\u2019t have anybody. Our work is primarily to save as many of those dogs as we can. We\u2019re a small charity working in a high [dog] destruction area.\u201d</p> <p>Rain Rescue can only house 16 dogs at a time, with others placed in foster homes. However, the charity has taken in 130 dogs this year \u2013 almost all from local authority pounds. \u201cWe base [our choice] on the ones that are most in need \u2013 often they\u2019re the ones who need emergency veterinary treatment, and sometimes the local authorities can\u2019t stretch to that,\u201d says Sanderson.</p> <p>There are, Sanderson says, spikes in summer, when people seem to abandon their dogs before going on holiday, and again at Christmas, when finances are stretched.</p> <p>There are penalties for abandoning a dog, but they are hard to enforce, says Paris. The good news is that fewer stray dogs were handled by local authorities in the last year than the year before. Paris puts this down to improved rates of microchipping, before the fitting of identification implants became law in April.</p> <p>Still, more than 37,000 unclaimed and unwanted dogs seems an appallingly high figure. Some of the dogs Sanderson sees have clearly been abused or neglected. On the other hand, Dogs Trust estimates that around an eighth of unclaimed dogs are cherished family animals, whose owners have simply failed to update their dog\u2019s microchip details, and who would be horrified to find that their pet faces destruction.</p> <p>\u201cSometimes you look at the dog and can see it\u2019s been well cared for at some point in its life,\u201d says Sanderson. Rain Rescue recently took in Herc, a clever German shepherd-rottweiler cross. \u201cHe has clearly been well-trained. You think: \u2018What has happened in that dog\u2019s life, or its owner\u2019s life, for it to end up in stray kennels with nobody to care for it?\u2019\u201d</p>",
  "<p>The way we <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/work-and-careers\" title=\"\">work</a> is changing: colleagues can be the other side of the world, and you can set up a business from a smartphone and be \u201cself-employed\u201d, while dependent for income on an online platform.

Taken together that is around one in five British workers in what are, increasingly unhelpfully, described as \u201cnon-standard work arrangements\u201d. Few people think these trends will reverse, and many predict that traditional employment will eventually become a minority pursuit.</p> <p>We know some of the causes of these changes. Business innovation, technological possibility and lifestyle preferences are combining. By and large, the flexibility is popular. Surveys consistently show that self-employed people are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/may/28/self-employed-greater-job-satisfaction-rsa-report\" title=\"\">happier with their work</a> than employees. About two-thirds of temporary workers choose to work temporarily, while the same proportion on zero-hours contracts do not want fixed hours; most report that they are happy with their <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/work-life-balance\" title=\"\">work-life balance</a>. But not everyone\u2019s experience of new work is positive.</p> <p>There is, for example, a particular problem with job security. While 92% of people <a href=\"http://www.bsa.natcen.ac.uk/media/39061/bsa33_work.pdf\" title=\"\">consider it to be important</a>, only 65% people think their job is secure, and 15% think it is insecure \u2013 that\u2019s around 5 million people wondering if they will be able to pay the bills each month, or what will happen to the mortgage if they\u2019re suddenly out of work. Stress in employment used to be correlated with seniority. Now those with lower incomes are just as likely to suffer anxiety at work.</p> <p>What\u2019s more, around 6 million people are not covered by the standard suite of workplace rights. Worryingly, that number continues to grow, and it shows how rapidly changing business models and working practices are continually stretching the limits of our employment rules. This is not to say that we need to rip up existing models; current employment rules do work for the majority of people. Indeed, employment in this country is at a record high; we have one of the fastest-growing developed economies in the world and we are flying high in the sectors \u2013 such as the creative and tech industries \u2013 that benefit most from flexibility in working practices. The question isn\u2019t how we reduce flexibility, but how we can make it work for more people.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/19/world-without-work-utopia-hell-human-labour-obsolete\">A world without work is coming \u2013 it could be utopia or it could be hell | Ryan Avent</a> </p> </aside>  <p>From employment regulations to tax and welfare rules, to public service operating hours, much is still premised on traditional employment. Can government do more to support non-standard workers? Can we strengthen their voice at work and in the corridors of power? Can we explore and promote new forms of enterprise as the distinction between owner, worker, contractor and consumer gets more blurred? And how can we create a virtuous cycle whereby better employment practices and opportunities for career development feed into higher productivity? These are among the questions I will be reviewing.</p> <p>No government can meaningfully improve the lives of ordinary people without addressing our experience of work. As the Guardian\u2019s John Harris has pointed out, there is a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/06/does-the-left-have-a-future\" title=\"\">world of difference</a> between the happily self-employed software consultant in Hackney and a worker on zero hours desperate for greater security and job progression, so I want the inquiry to get out and about talking to people from across the country about how their experience of work affects their day-to-day lives. Government can play an important role but this is also about the decisions we make as workers, investors, consumers and citizens.</p> <p>The world is changing fast, sometimes bewilderingly so, and there is every reason to be excited. But policy has to become ever more adaptive. The government has to think hard about the difference it can make not just by changing laws but by shaping expectations, promoting dialogue and encouraging innovation. As chair of the inquiry I start out with an open mind to the methods of change, but we can all surely agree on the goal: that the fast-changing modern labour market is one that should offer citizens growing opportunity and control.</p>",

  "<p>In February 1969, I watched the first episode of Kenneth Clark\u2019s famous TV series, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2014/may/18/kenneth-clark-civilised-man-art-historian-civilisation\" title=\"\"><em>Civilisation</em></a>. I&#xa0;can still picture him, standing on&#xa0;barbaric northern headlands, explaining that \u201cour\u201d civilisation had barely survived the collapse of the Roman empire. We had come through only \u201cby the skin of our teeth\u201d. It was an incongruous scene: Clark \u2013 Winchester and Oxford educated, connoisseur and collector, former director of the National Gallery \u2013 looked every inch the toff as he walked in his brogues and Burberry over the battered countryside, where wellington boots and a woolly would have been more appropriate. But I tingled slightly as he&#xa0;repeated that phrase, \u201cby the skin of&#xa0;our teeth\u201d. I was just 14, and it had never struck me that \u201ccivilisation\u201d might be such a fragile thing, still less that it might be possible to trace a history of European culture, as Clark was to do, in 13 parts, from the early middle ages to the 20th century.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Civilisation had shown us that there was something in art and architecture that was worth talking, and arguing, about</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>A few years later, now more a devotee of John Berger\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2012/sep/07/ways-seeing-berger-tv-programme-british\" title=\"\"><em>Ways of Seeing</em></a> (a TV series and book devised in hostile reaction to <em>Civilisation</em>), I began to feel decidedly uncomfortable with Clark\u2019s patrician self-confidence and the \u201cgreat man\u201d approach to art history \u2013 one damn genius after the next \u2013 that ran through the series. I was very doubtful, too, about the image of wild barbarians at the gates that Clark conjured up in that first episode: it was as crude an oversimplification of barbarism as his dreamy notion of ideal perfection was an oversimplification of classicism. Nonetheless, <em>Civilisation</em> had opened my eyes, and those of many others; not only visually stunning, it had shown us that there was something in art and architecture that was worth talking, and arguing, about.</p> <p>Some of the best chapters in James Stourton\u2019s careful biography discuss the making of this series. Clark was then in his early 60s and a considerable catch for its commissioner David Attenborough, who was trying to give the first wave of colour TV on BBC2 a more highbrow image than it had acquired in the&#xa0;US. What better than a series that would feature \u201call the most beautiful pictures and buildings\u201d of the last 2,000 years&#xa0;of western European history?</p> <p>Despite the commonly held belief that Clark was an upper-crust scholar plucked from some dusty museum basement who luckily proved to be a \u201cnatural\u201d on screen, he had already made dozens of programmes for ITV, including one featuring an argument with Berger over Picasso\u2019s <em>Guernica</em> (the two men were ideological enemies but personal friends). He was the obvious man for the job. Less obvious was the&#xa0;director assigned to the series: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2005/oct/28/broadcasting.bbc\" title=\"\">Michael&#xa0;Gill</a>, father of the&#xa0;critic AA Gill, who did&#xa0;not share Clark\u2019s aesthetic viewpoint (\u201cMichael would probably have wanted to be the&#xa0;barbarian at the gate,\u201d his wife observed). To begin with, getting the pair to collaborate was, according to one BBC source, rather like \u201cmating pandas\u201d.</p> <p>For some viewers, <em>Civilisation</em> was life-changing. In the letters Clark received after the broadcasts, no fewer than nine correspondents claimed they&#xa0;had been dissuaded from suicide simply by watching (modestly, Clark wasn\u2019t sure whether to believe them). Even the Sun hyped Clark as \u201cthe Gibbon of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/jul/26/marshall-mcluhan-conservatism-medium-is-message\" title=\"\">McLuhan</a> age\u201d, and he was promptly given a peerage. The rumour was that Mary Wilson said to&#xa0;Harold, after one of their regular Sunday evening viewings in 10 Downing Street: \u201cThat man must go to the House of Lords.\u201d And so he did.</p> <p>But <em>Civilisation</em> was not an instant ratings success. At its first showing, it captured less than 2% of the available audience (compared with 35% for <em>The&#xa0;Forsyte Saga</em>). And Berger was not the only critic of Clark\u2019s \u201ctop-down\u201d approach to cultural politics; others complained that they were watching the elitist musings of an Edwardian critic. Clark\u2019s silly jibes at \u201cpseudo-Marxists\u201d (for some reason, a notch below \u201creal\u201d ones), and his boasts of being a \u201cstick-in-the-mud\u201d laid him open to this.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>On one of his ITV programmes on 'good taste' he seems to have taken a line closer to Grayson Perry than to Brian Sewell</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>As Stourton shows, some of the criticisms do not stick. Although the programmes concentrated on western Europe, Clark was not blind (as he was charged) to other artistic traditions: he had been devoted to Japanese art since childhood. And however patrician his manner, he was a lifelong Labour voter. In fact, in one of his ITV programmes on \u201cgood taste\u201d he seems to have taken a line closer to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/video/2012/jun/18/grayson-perry-good-taste-video\" title=\"\">Grayson Perry</a> than to Brian Sewell.</p> <p>But Stourton frankly concedes one glaring omission in <em>Civilisation</em>. This was a \u201cgreat man\u201d approach in the most literal sense. Hardly any women got a look-in, and when very occasionally they did, it was not as creative artists or even patrons, but as hostesses, temptresses, Virgin Marys, or something woolly called the \u201cfemale principle\u201d. Almost the only woman credited, briefly, with an independent role was <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_Fry\" title=\"\">Elizabeth Fry</a>, the prison reformer \u2013 and, it so happens, the ancestor of one of Clark\u2019s long-standing mistresses.</p> <p>Contested though they still are, it is far easier to evaluate Clark\u2019s TV programmes than the rest of his life. On the surface, his was a golden career. Born in 1903 into a family of the idle rich&#xa0;(\u201cmany richer \u2026 few idler\u201d, as he put it), he made his way through school and university against the usual background of loyal nannies, vicious schoolmasters and cranky dons, before managing to get himself apprenticed briefly to the art historian <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/aug/11/my-dear-bb-letters-bernard-berenson-kenneth-clark-review\" title=\"\">Bernard Berenson</a> in Florence. A glittering CV&#xa0;followed: keeper of fine art at the Ashmolean, director of the National Gallery, keeper of the king\u2019s pictures, chairman of the Independent Television Authority, and so on, ending up&#xa0;a member of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/apr/19/order-of-merit-helps-if-you-are-male-elizabeth-11\" title=\"\">Order of Merit</a>, an august body that he found, predictably enough, full of his old pals.</p> <p>Reading between the lines of Stourton\u2019s account, it seems clear that he was good at big ideas, not so good at&#xa0;attention to detail (always a peril for&#xa0;men, like Clark, who don\u2019t actually need a salary to survive). His tenure at the National Gallery is a case in point. Appointed when he was just 30 in 1933, he scored some great successes: he installed electric light; he opened up early on FA Cup final day to encourage fans to visit; he masterminded the evacuation of the major paintings to the Welsh mines during the second world war; and he reinvented the gallery as a&#xa0;cultural centre for wartime London (with hugely popular concerts organised by <a href=\"https://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/paintings/history/myra-hess-concerts/myra-remembered\" title=\"\">Myra Hess</a>). Yet the staff were almost entirely against him, and it was partly their opposition that led to his resignation as soon as the war ended.</p> <p>Clark\u2019s supporters tend to paint his subordinates as small-minded bureaucrats, narrow scholars or, occasionally, psychopaths; and so they may have been. But one of Stourton\u2019s anecdotes hints at a different story. Clark was going home one evening when he was surprised to see a newspaper hoarding: \u201cNational Gallery. Grave Scandal.\u201d It&#xa0;turned out that one of the gallery\u2019s accountants had had his fingers in the till for years, and all had been made public. Although director, Clark knew absolutely nothing about it.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It is dangerous to investigate marital wars from beyond the grave, and even more presumptuous to try to apportion blame</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>But it is women, again, who are the most uncomfortable part of Clark\u2019s story. His wife, Jane, had read history at Oxford; they married in 1927 and soon had three children (including Alan Clark MP, of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2000/oct/15/politicalbooks.politics\" title=\"\"><em>Diaries</em></a> and other fame). By the end of the 30s, Clark \u201cstarted being unfaithful to his wife\u201d and had multiple dalliances \u2013 \u201ca vigorous private life\u201d in Stourton\u2019s euphemism \u2013 until her death in 1976. Jane, meanwhile, is said to have become increasingly difficult and dependent on alcohol and prescription drugs. It is always dangerous to investigate marital wars from beyond the grave, and even more presumptuous to try to apportion blame. But biographers should watch their rhetoric and at least let the different parties keep their dignity. Stourton tries, but does not always succeed.</p> <p>There is little room for independent women in Stourton\u2019s version of Clark\u2019s life. Jane wins his praise early on for her elegance and her dress sense; she was \u201ca natural and beautiful hostess\u201d. When she doesn\u2019t fit that type, she gets written up as the monstrous, unstable spouse of a long-suffering husband: \u201cThe more she tormented him, the more he sought solace elsewhere.\u201d Stourton occasionally recognises that this logic could be reversed: \u201cThe more he screwed around, the more screwed up she got.\u201d There are simply different ground rules for men and women. When Clark breaks down and cries in a gents\u2019 lavatory in Washington DC in response to a rapturous reaction to <em>Civilisation</em>, that is a sign of his sensitive ambivalence to fame. When the women cry, they are being hysterical.</p> <p>The mistresses generally fare no better than the wife. Stourton only mentions in passing that Janet Stone, the descendant of Elizabeth Fry and mistress of Clark for almost 30 years, was an important photographer in her own right. But he does clearly see the poignant side of a discovery made after Clark\u2019s death: a box of letters from her that he had never bothered, or brought himself, to open.</p> <p>Clark\u2019s television presentation of women as objects of desire or inspiration was not all that far from the way women in his own life continue to be portrayed: \u201ca muse without a role\u201d, as he once dubbed Jane.</p> <p>\u2022 <em>Kenneth Clark: Life, Art and Civilisation</em> is published by <a href=\"https://www.harpercollins.co.uk/9780007493418/kenneth-clark\" title=\"\">HarperCollins</a>.

  "<p>Driving east from Venice along the autostrada, it only takes half an hour to leave the tourists behind and cross into the very different world of Friuli. This autonomous and proudly independent region is officially known as Friuli-Venezia Giulia, a wild and still little-known corner of Italy that has its own language, a distinctive local cuisine, and a host of world-famous wines grown on rolling hillside vineyards. Strategically located at the crossroads of central Europe, Friuli stretches over Italy\u2019s north-eastern border, from the lagoons and sandy beaches of the Adriatic coast to the grand maritime port of Trieste, along the frontier with Slovenia, then up into wild Alpine scenery and the border with Austria.

  "<p>I never learned to ride a bike as a child. I grew up in London in the 1970s, and it just wasn\u2019t on my radar. Plus I was scared of falling. It wasn\u2019t until I was 41, married to a keen cyclist and feeling I was missing out, that we decided to give a tandem a try. The first time we rode it I was terrified. We\u2019ve since done over 2,000 miles and it has become our favourite mode of transport.</p> <p>The front rider is known as the pilot. They control the gears, braking and signalling. The back rider is the stoker. They provide the power. That tends to be my job: pedal, pedal, pedal. The heavier rider should be at the front. It\u2019s bad enough going up a hill when you\u2019re dragging 20-plus stone and the weight of the bike, without having an anchor on the back.</p> <p>Trust and communication are vital. It can be disconcerting \u2013 even dangerous \u2013 if someone decides to brake, freewheel on the pedals or change gear without warning, especially for the stoker whose view of the road ahead is obstructed. You have to be aware of what the other person is doing the whole time, and communicate what you\u2019re about to do. When you get it right and you\u2019re perfectly in sync, you feel like you\u2019re part of a machine. Somehow we never bicker. Well, I did have a few words when Phil piloted us at speed through a large puddle.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/sep/10/my-workout-amy-horton-rock-climber-adrenaline-rush\">My workout: Amy Horton, 26, rock climber \u2013 \u2018It can be scary\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <p>We\u2019ve got \u201cnormal\u201d bicycles, but we never ride them. With the tandem, we have the freedom of being on the bike, getting fresh air and enjoying the countryside, combined with being able to spend time with each other. We can have a conversation without having to shout across to another bike.</p> <p>People are supportive and curious. The reaction from teenage boys is surprising. Of all the things you would have thought a teenage boy would not find cool, it would be two middle-aged people on the same bike, and yet they\u2019ll say, \u201cWow, cool bike!\u201d On a tandem, you\u2019re guaranteed smiles and comments from people you pass.</p> <h2>My weekend workout<br></h2> <p><strong>How often do you ride? </strong>Once a week, more in summer<br><strong>Longest trip? </strong>77 miles<br><strong>Toughest challenge? </strong>Ditchling Beacon in East Sussex<br><strong>Favourite place to ride? </strong>The Chilterns where we live</p> <h2>Five ways to get started: tandem cycling<br></h2> <p><strong>1</strong> The <a href=\"http://tandem-club.org.uk\">Tandem Club website</a> is a useful resource for curious cyclists. It lists all the locations across the country where you can buy or hire a tandem, as well as details of organised tandem rides.</p> <p><strong>2</strong> You can pick up a secondhand tandem for relatively little on eBay, but it\u2019s worth having a go first. Many bikes shops that sell tandems will let you try before you buy. You\u2019ll find out soon enough if it\u2019s not for you.</p> <p><strong>3</strong> The lighter the bike, the better. It just makes riding that much easier and more enjoyable, especially if you\u2019re going to be tackling hills. Having said that, a heavy bike does have its advantages on the way back down.</p> <p><strong>4</strong> Choose your riding partner wisely. If you have a tendency to argue, or you\u2019re still in the first flush of love, it could all go horribly wrong. There\u2019s nothing like a tandem to expose cracks in your communication.</p> <p><strong>5</strong> Do not underestimate the turning circle of a tandem.

However, the online estate agent also says that by the time we reach 55 nearly a third of us no longer think such a thing exists.</p> <p>\u201cIf you want to move up the property ladder at this age, be realistic,\u201d says David Hollingworth at London &amp; Country Mortgages. \u201cConsider house prices and the cost of the move, and assess your income and expenses. Use these figures to shape your expectations.\u201d</p> <p>One way to lower monthly mortgage payments is by opting for a longer repayment term. Some lenders will do 35- or even 40-year loans, and an increasing number are prepared to lend well beyond retirement age. Traditionally, many lenders would only grant a mortgage up to an individual\u2019s planned retirement date \u2013 so for someone aged 45 who expects to retire at 67, that meant a maximum mortgage term of 22 years. But things are changing, and a number of building societies in particular will let you have a mortgage until you are 85-plus. In July, Nationwide <a href=\"http://www.nationwide.co.uk/about/media-centre-and-specialist-areas/media-centre/press-releases/archive/2016/5/9-may-mortgage-lending\" title=\"\">upped its \u201cmaximum age at maturity\u201d</a> from 75 to 85, while <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2016/may/06/halifax-raises-mortgage-borrower-age-limit-80\" title=\"\">the Halifax raised its maximum </a> from 75 to 80.</p> <p>If you are happy to live in a new-build, the <a href=\"https://www.helptobuy.gov.uk/equity-loan/equity-loans/\" title=\"\">help to buy equity loan scheme will see </a> the government lend you up to 20% of the cost.</p> <h2><strong>Pensions</strong></h2>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Investing in a pension is important \u2013 don\u2019t overlook it due to other middle-aged financial commitments</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Positivity about having enough for retirement reaches its lowest ebb between the ages of 45 and 54, according to a study by Skipton building society, when nearly two in five (39%) people say that they feel their preferred lifestyle for retirement is out of reach.</p> <p>However, if you\u2019ve accrued various money purchase (defined contribution) workplace pensions, get them to work harder. Bringing them all under one roof may make sense financially, and will make it easier to keep track of them.</p> <p>\u201cThere is a danger that long-forgotten plans will end up festering in expensive, poorly performing funds, and the paperwork alone can be enough to put you off becoming more proactive,\u201d <a href=\"http://www.which.co.uk/money/retirement/guides/should-i-consolidate-my-pensions/\" title=\"\">says consumer body Which?</a>. There are advantages to switching your pensions, but also pitfalls, such as exit penalties. So check what the deal is first. If you\u2019re not completely sure what you\u2019ve got where, the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/find-pension-contact-details\" title=\"\">Pension Tracing Service</a> can help with finding \u201clost\u201d pensions</p> <p>Many pensions offer additional voluntary contributions (AVCs). If you can afford to, these could be one of the best financial decisions you make. The best AVCs see employers paying in as well as employees \u2013 for example, they might cough up 50p for each \u00a31 you put in.</p> <p>Danny Cox, chartered financial planner at Hargreaves Lansdown, says: \u201cThink about the age you want to retire and how much is needed to fund your lifestyle. Investing in a pension is important \u2013 don\u2019t overlook it due to other middle-aged financial commitments, such as savings and paying off debts.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Debts</strong></h2> <p>Credit cards, overdrafts, personal loans, mortgages, student debts, store cards \u2026 many middle-aged people have racked up some serious debt. It can be harder to make more than the minimum payments at this time: SunLife found that as a percentage of income, those aged 45-54 have more than half of their income allocated to fixed costs.</p> <p>\u201cMany people experience significant money problems in middle age, when pressure on finances can often come from both directions in the family tree,\u201d says Jane Tully, a spokeswoman for the <a href=\"http://www.moneyadvicetrust.org/Pages/default.aspx\" title=\"\">Money Advice Trust</a>. \u201cSeeking free advice is the first step \u2013 you can start to consider setting aside any surplus income for these needs.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>The cost of children</strong></h2> <p>By middle age some of the early childcare costs are over \u2013 but there\u2019s plenty still to pay. For those with children in private education, average fees per term for boarding are \u00a310,317, while average day fees per term are \u00a34,541, <a href=\"https://www.isc.co.uk/media/3179/isc_census_2016_final.pdf\" title=\"\">according to the Independent Schools Council</a>. Many parents go for a longer mortgage term, and lower monthly payments, to release some cash for this, says Cox.</p> <p>As for university, the typical graduate of an English university, under the \u00a39,000 fees regime, owes an average of around \u00a344,000, <a href=\"http://www.suttontrust.com/newsarchive/graduates-in-england-facing-debts-of-44000/\" title=\"\">according to thinktank the Sutton Trust</a>. And after graduation, and a boomerang back into the family home, getting them on to the property ladder is a concern. The Halifax issued data showing that the average deposit paid by a first-time buyer increased by 13% in 2015 to \u00a332,927.</p> <p>\u201cOne of the best ways to save for university and a deposit is a tax-free Junior Isa,\u201d says Cox. \u201cDo this as early as you can, and by the time your child is 18 they can access the funds. However, parents should only do this once they have their own debts under control and their retirement savings in place.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>It has taken me a long time to even attempt to write this down and it\u2019s an effort to condense my thoughts and feelings into something coherent. I\u2019m hoping that putting pen to paper may alleviate some of my anxieties. It all started when I was about nine and your friend from work started helping Dad out with DIY projects and accompanying us on weekend wine runs to France and family holidays.</p> <p>To begin with, it all seemed quite innocent. Dad needed a hand with things and your friend supplied his services in exchange for cups of coffee and evening meals. Early on, I remember you mentioned that you thought your work friend fancied you and as an easily embarrassed child I just giggled and ran off.</p> <p>Since then, every Christmas and birthday, he has lavished you with gifts. You\u2019re always happy to accept then, making excuses such as, \u201cIf he wants to waste his money on me, that\u2019s fine.\u201d</p> <p>I can understand your attraction to him. You\u2019ve always been desperate for attention and control.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Dad is calm and reserved but resolute in his views. When you met somebody so eager to impress you, agree with you and take you for expensive meals while Dad was working the late shift, you couldn\u2019t possibly resist.</p> <p>You have no idea that I\u2019ve seen the messages, lingering hugs and longing glances. I think the instance where you and I went away for my 12th birthday tops it off, though. I imagine it has slipped your memory but it\u2019s firmly planted in mine. Your phone rang while we were in the hotel and I heard the voice at the other end say, \u201cI\u2019m just calling to say that I love you and I miss you\u201d \u2013 except the voice wasn\u2019t Dad\u2019s.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Our relationship is built on lies and you don\u2019t realise that I figured that out a long time ago</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Over the years, I\u2019ve confronted you about the situation in my head on countless occasions. I\u2019m not sure whether Dad knows. I\u2019m sure he has suspicions but has chosen to ignore them in the hope of leading a quiet life in his later years.</p> <p>I remember when Dad was in hospital, you said, \u201cX thinks he could replace Dad if anything happens to him.\u201d That will never happen. If Dad leaves us before you, I\u2019ll be ready to cut all ties. I have to remind myself that I\u2019d lose contact with Dad if I said anything now and I\u2019m not sure how he\u2019d cope with the commotion at his age.</p> <p>I\u2019m still trying to come to terms with the way that you continue to deceive your family and friends. You think that everyone is oblivious to your secret: that you have been having an affair for almost 15 years with a man whom everyone mocks for his lack of personality, gormlessness and general ignorance. It\u2019s surprising, too, given that you left your first husband because of his infidelity.</p> <p>Perhaps the hardest thing to bear is knowing that you are unaware of the damage that you have already caused. Our relationship is built on lies and you don\u2019t realise that I figured that out a long time ago. Your behaviour has left deep wounds that will never heal. You often accuse me of lacking feelings but how could I ever share my thoughts and desires with anyone when the one person a daughter should be able to trust and count on for honesty and advice is all but a distant memory, and has been since your friend entered our lives all those years ago?</p> <p><em>Your \u201cdarling daughter\u201d</em></p>",
  "<p>It\u2019s enough to set any parent\u2019s heart racing. An urgent call from the school to say your child has been involved in cyberbullying. You want to know the name of the child who has dared to say anything hurtful about your son or daughter. Then horror as you discover your child is the bully.</p> <p>It\u2019s an excruciating scenario, and one that could make you feel you have failed as a parent. Yet with an increasing number of cyberbullying victims, there must be a growing number of culprits. There are steps that parents can take to help tackle cyberbullying by understanding the online worlds they inhabit and the technology they use.</p> <p><strong>Could my child be a cyberbully?</strong></p> <p>Children may be able to weave their way round apps and social media at Formula One speeds, yet not be mature enough to understand the consequences and implications of the content they post and share. Two thirds of secondary school pupils agreed it was easier to say something hurtful online than face to face.</p> <p>No one likes the idea of their child as a cyberbully or a bystander to bullying. There is a possibility your child has bullied, or been a witness to it, without fully understanding how it has affected the victim.</p> <p><strong>Why is this an important time of year?</strong></p> <p>Online searches for the term cyberbullying spike at this time of the year, when children are back at school. The number of people who contact me for advice on the issue also peaks at this time. Many children will have started the term with their first smartphone, giving them digital independence and opening up the world of social media. Kids today network with a wider circle of friends that a child growing up in the 1980s could only have dreamed of.</p> <p><strong>How does cyberbullying compare with bullying face to face?</strong></p> <p>Bullying has changed. No longer does it stop at the school gates. Comments online stick around, they breed and they have an audience. Before, bullies could only get to you between the hours of 9am and 3pm, but cyberbullying has the potential to affect someone day and night and it offers a degree of anonymity to the perpetrator. By setting up a fake alias that bears no resemblance to your name, the cyberbully is free to say and do as he or she chooses.</p> <p><strong>What should I say to my child if I find out they are bullying someone online?</strong></p> <p>We\u2019ve all done things we regret, it\u2019s not so black and white to children. The important thing is that your child talks to someone if they\u2019ve messed up. Try not to get angry or overreact \u2013 work out together how to remove inflammatory or offensive content and make amends with the people involved. Some children like to express their feelings in different ways \u2013 if your child finds it hard to sit down with you, let them know they can contact a confidential helpline (such as <a href=\"https://www.childline.org.uk/\">Childline</a>) for advice.</p> <p><strong>What can I do to prevent my child from cyberbullying?</strong></p> <p>It\u2019s vital to show an interest in their digital life and give your relationship with your child a regular health check. Talk about which apps and websites they use, and the kind of things they post on social media. Explain how important it is to think before they post and not say anything online that they wouldn\u2019t say face to face.</p> <p><strong>How do I encourage them to use social media in a positive way?</strong></p> <p>Explain the nuance between sharing what they think might be funny, versus the potential to cause offence. Ask them how they would feel if they were on the receiving end. It is just as important to have manners online as it is at the dinner table or the school hall.</p> <p><strong>What could have turned my child in to a cyberbully?</strong></p> <p>Your child might be hearing or seeing things that affects their behaviour choices \u2013 on TV, social media or others at school. This change in behaviour could include prejudicial attitudes towards fellow pupils, such as racism, attitudes towards disability, sexism, homophobia, transphobia, etc.</p> <p><strong>Who should I tell if my child has bullied someone online?</strong></p> <p>Talk to family and friends \u2013 some may have had a similar experience. Don\u2019t be afraid to talk to their teacher to send clear messages to your child about the impact it could have on them and children they are targeting.</p> <p><em>\u2022 Dr Linda Papadopoulos is supporting the campaign by Internet Matters to help parents deal with cyberbullying, <a href=\"https://www.internetmatters.org/issues/cyberbullying/\">internetmatters.org/cyberbullying </a></em></p>",

Fox has hinted he favours a \u201chard Brexit\u201d that would see the UK give up the benefits of the single market but allow it to limit immigration from the EU.</p> <p>It is understood that Conservatives from the pro-remain wing of the party are planning to put pressure on the government over Brexit during the four-day conference by calling for a more concrete plans, especially to allay business worries.<br></p> <p>One senior Tory MP said: \u201cI think the PM will find that \u2018Brexit means Brexit\u2019 is quickly losing its value, and needs to be replaced by some more concrete details \u2013 fast. It is beginning to look vacuous and like she is playing for time.\u201d</p> <p>Some Tory MPs, however, took a different view about pressure on May to set a firmer timetable for leaving the EU, including Dominic Grieve, the former attorney general and remain campaigner. \u201cI don\u2019t think that the party conference is a place where the prime minister should feel pressured to set out her stall when she\u2019s got a great deal of work still to do on Brexit before article 50 is invoked,\u201d he told the Guardian. Grieve is among those warning that a \u201chard Brexit\u201d is a very high risk strategy and put the UK\u2019s economy and jobs at risk.</p> <p>Fox\u2019s grasp of trade law also came under attack from Sir David Edward, a former judge in the European court of justice who is advising the Scottish government on Brexit. Edward challenged Fox\u2019s claim that the UK would keep the EU\u2019s existing tariff schedule when it leaves the bloc.</p> <p>\u201cNobody who understands trade law could have possibly have said what he said,\u201d he told an MLex Competition conference.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/aug/22/brexit-means-brexit-when-is-big-question\">Brexit means Brexit \u2026 but the big question is when?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cAnd as an economist has said, there is no such thing in today\u2019s world as free trade or a free trade agreement, there is only managed trade or participation in a regulated market, and that is quite important.

And that is that they do not want to see the economy suffer,\u201d he said. \u201cThey do not want to see jobs lost, they do not want to see standards of living decline. So they will expect us to negotiate a solution which delivers the key elements of leaving the EU, regaining our sovereignty, getting control over our borders \u2013 but they will expect us to do all of that in a way that allows the UK economy to go on growing.\u201d<br></p> <p>Hammond is thought to be fighting the case within the cabinet for a deal that retains as much access to the single market as possible, against colleagues who would rather push for a \u201chard Brexit\u201d deal that distances the UK further from EU trade rules in order to achieve tougher controls on migration. </p>",
  "<p>In the early 1970s, at a school near Pontypridd, two teenagers sat in a physics lesson and discussed whose was the best dad. Until then, Gethin Russell-Jones had counted the other boy, Mark, as a friend \u2013 but not this day. \u201cMark said that his dad\u2019s job as a fireman was useful whereas my dad, a Baptist minister, probably did nothing from one Sunday to another.\u201d</p> <p>The conversation turned to war. \u201cAt that time, the question of what people did in the war kept coming up,\u201d says Gethin. Mark\u2019s dad had fought in North Africa during the second world war and Gethin recalls reddening as he told Mark that his dad had been a conscientious objector. He had had to explain what it meant as Mark didn\u2019t know the term. He was incredulous. (\u201cWhat sort of man did that? Did he agree with Hitler? Didn\u2019t he care?\u201d)</p> <p>Gethin rushed to his father\u2019s defence (ironically, a full-on fight followed). But that schoolboy exchange plagued him for decades because, more and more, he found himself agreeing with Mark. \u201cWhen I was very young, six or seven, I remember feeling quite proud that my dad had been a conchie \u2013 that he\u2019d said no,\u201d says Gethin. \u201cIt made him different, gave him a mystique. As I got older and learned more about the war, it became more of an issue. At some point, I began asking Dad what would have happened if the Germans had invaded. He had no satisfactory answer.\u201d</p> <p>Last year \u2013 by then a Baptist pastor himself, as well as the father of four adult children \u2013 Gethin began to delve deeper into John\u2019s story. His book Conchie: What My Father Didn\u2019t Do in the War is the result.</p> <p>Ironically, the project had its origins in a book Gethin had co-written two years earlier with his mother, Mair, about her own war experience.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>In the face of something as monstrous as Hitler, or Isis, what do you do? You can\u2019t do nothing</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>In 1940, Mair had been studying music and German at Cardiff University when she was recruited by the Foreign Office (there really was a tap on the shoulder from a man in a dark suit) to join the code breakers of <a href=\"https://www.bletchleypark.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Bletchley Park</a>. Bound by the Official Secrets Act, Mair remained silent on the subject until the final decade of her life. She died, aged 96, on the day <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/my-secret-life-in-hut-six.html\" title=\"\">My Secret Life in Hut Six</a> was finished.</p> <p>\u201cMy father died before Mum \u2013 and it was almost a challenge to see if I could write about him and what that would look like,\u201d says Gethin. \u201cMy mum was positive, pragmatic, resilient \u2013 she had this huge narrative of the way she dealt with Hitler. My dad had an ideology, but what was his story?</p> <p>\u201cMy mum had always been more accessible. If I needed to talk about something, I\u2019d instinctively go to her. Dad was more aloof, always a bit removed. There was an isolation about him. He was cloistered, quite monastic, uncomfortable in wider society. Being in a pub, for example, or at a rugby match, was just awkward. In a way, this book is the typical story of a son struggling to understand his father.\u201d</p> <p>Conchie draws extensively on John Russell-Jones\u2019s journals, memoirs and sermon notes, which had been packed away for decades in a draughty garage. \u201cI\u2019m the youngest of five but none of us had really looked through them,\u201d says Gethin. \u201cFrom time to time, we\u2019d think, we really should transcribe these.\u2019 Much of it was scribblings, some in battered old diaries, some on the back of old electricity bills. None of it was linear. I had to get used to finding random gems.\u201d</p> <p>Pieced together, they create a vivid picture of a boy coming of age in the aftermath of the first world war and the shadow of Hitler\u2019s rise to power. Born in 1918, John had a Welsh working class background \u2013 his father and grandfather had been tin plate workers and John was the first in his family to go to grammar school and university.</p> <p>John describes one of his teachers, a brilliant Oxford scholar, who had returned from the Somme a \u201cnervous wreck\u201d. That war was supposed to have been the \u201cwar to end all wars\u201d, yet already unease was creeping across Europe.</p> <p>For John, family life revolved around the chapel, where the minister was an outspoken pacifist. Inspired by him, 13-year-old John took part in school debates and gave speeches at a local literary society, arguing that warfare was incompatible with Christianity, that Christians should \u201cwork for justice and equality\u201d and \u201cagainst state-sponsored greed, including war\u201d.</p> <p>By 1939, when the National Service Act required men between 18 and 41 to register, John was studying to be a Baptist minister. Although this was one of the automatically exempt professions, he insisted on attending a tribunal to voice his protest and be officially registered as a conscientious objector. His careful preparations, his speech and the reaction of the officials on the board (one pointed out that the Old Testament was full of wars) makes fascinating reading.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It\u2019s one thing to have convictions but to do nothing, to risk so many other people\u2019s lives \u2026 it doesn\u2019t seem right</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>From this point on though, the war seems to take a back seat in John\u2019s life: he joins other Christian groups, he meets Mair (and notes that they \u201cagree to disagree\u201d on the subject of war). He glides seamlessly towards his calling as an ordained minister. Meanwhile, Europe is in turmoil.</p> <p>\u201cGoing through his papers and looking at the timeline, I got quite irritated with him,\u201d says Gethin. \u201cDad went from having quite a positive view, a belief that by getting together, we could make the world better, to a much narrower outlook, which was all about his personal faith. I don\u2019t remember any diary entries which even mention world events. It\u2019s 1944 and hellish in Europe and Dad\u2019s disappearing down a rabbit hole of self-examination. I read them thinking, come on, Dad!\u201d</p> <p>For the rest of John\u2019s long life \u2013 he lived until he was 92 \u2013 he barely spoke publicly about his pacifism, despite having a weekly platform on which to do it. It had morphed from a public protest to a private decision. \u201cHis whole life revolved around the New Testament. The Sermon on the Mount was his starting point,\u201d says Gethin. \u201cIf you have an enemy, you don\u2019t kill them. You forgive them, however hard that is.\u201d</p> <p>Despite sharing his father\u2019s faith, Gethin remains torn on this point. \u201cIn the face of something as monstrous as Hitler, or Isis, what do you do? You can\u2019t do nothing. It\u2019s one thing to have convictions but to do nothing, to risk so many other people\u2019s lives \u2026 it doesn\u2019t seem right.</p> <p>\u201cWhen I researched the book, I spoke to family members older than me who remembered Dad at that time and a number said they just couldn\u2019t imagine John going to war. They said, \u2018He wasn\u2019t a killing man. But most people aren\u2019t killing types are they? There must have been millions of men recruited who were terrified, who\u2019d never imagined picking up a gun. So that doesn\u2019t really answer it.\u201d</p> <p>At the same time, Gethin can\u2019t help but admire his father\u2019s courage. \u201cHe chose to put his head above the parapet and he didn\u2019t need to.\u201d</p> <p>He also envies his deep certainty. \u201cTo some extent, Dad didn\u2019t really care whether he was understood or misunderstood,\u201d says Gethin. \u201cI\u2019m more ambivalent. I duck and dive. For me, there\u2019s a sliding scale of morality here. My dad was consistent. The pacifist he was as a 92-year-old man was the pacifist he was at 22 \u2013 \u2018God loves his enemies. Jesus told us to love our enemies and turn the other cheek.\u2019</p> <p>\u201cThis was his view and nothing would shift that. You could say that\u2019s intransigent and narrow \u2013 or you could say that\u2019s quite a thing.\u201d</p> <p><em>\u2022 Conchie: What My Father Didn\u2019t Do in the War by Gethin Russell-Jones is published by Lion Books, \u00a39.99.

Foxtel representatives have told Guardian Australia the series will still be premiering in Australia, and the airdate and series rollout will be announced soon.</p> <p>Pacific Heat was created by Rob Sitch, Tom Gleisner and Santo Cilauro of Working Dog Productions, and follows three agents \u2013 voiced by the creators \u2013 from an undercover special unit. </p> <p>According to Foxtel\u2019s description of the series, the Pacific Heat squad have been tasked with exposing the \u201cseedy underbelly\u201d of the \u201cglitzy, glamorous Gold Coast, a sun-drenched paradise where sun and surf meets soaring crime rates and underneath the coconut oil lays a hot-bed of crime\u201d. </p> <p>Sitch plays Special Agent Todd Sommerville, \u201ca cop unconcerned with bending the rules\u201d; Cilauro plays Special Agent Zac Valentic, \u201cthe tough man of the team\u201d; and Gleisner plays The Chief: \u201ctough, street-smart and still unhappy that his peptic ulcer doesn\u2019t entitle him to a disabled parking spot\u201d.

He listed South Park, The A-Team, Hawaii Five-0 and Charlie\u2019s Angels as influences. </p> <p>The team had initially envisaged three to five series, he said \u2013 \u201cbut funny enough, I was looking at the South Park guys at 20 [seasons] and I was sure they were going to stop at six.
