They had given everything in their pursuit of gold in the final of the wheelchair tennis doubles, fighting back from a set down to raise hopes that they would build on their <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/jul/09/don-reid-and-alfie-hewitt-win-wimbledon-wheelchair-mens-doubles\" title=\"\">triumphant run at Wimbledon</a> by becoming Paralympic champions, but the young British duo ran out of steam and La Marseillaise soundtracked the medal ceremony.</p> <p>However, this was only the penultimate chapter in the Rio adventure for a double act dubbed Heid by their noisy pack of supporters. They will be on opposite sides of the net on Friday, when they will have to put their personal and professional relationship to one side in an all-British Paralympics singles final.</p> <p>It is unlikely to be dull \u2013 wheelchair tennis rarely is. It is a wonderfully absorbing sport, skilled, imaginative, brilliantly athletic, and the fans on Centre Court certainly enjoyed their doubles experience.</p> <p>Reid and Hewett settled for silver after losing to the impressive French pair of St\u00e9phane Houdet and Nicolas Peifer, whose 6-2, 4-6, 6-1 victory was their first Paralympic gold together.</p> <p>There is no shortage of history when these four share a court. Reid beat Houdet in the semi-final of the singles here while the French pair were looking for revenge for their defeat in the Wimbledon final in July.</p> <p>Each player settled into a pleasing groove during the early sparring but Hewett quickly became anxious in the light breeze. He argued with the umpire after a tight call went against him and he was seen as a potential weak link by the more experienced Frenchmen. Houdetis 45 and Peifer is 25. Hewett lookedcallow in their company, spraying the ball long and wide with increasing regularity.</p> <p>France took control of the opening set, attacking Hewett\u2019s serve and breaking for an early lead, and the 18-year-old was making far too many errors. Britain trailed 5-2 after a crushing volley from Peifer in Hewett\u2019s second service game.</p> <p>Reid, the Australian Open and Wimbledon champion, seemed to take the loss of the first set as a personal affront. He celebrated loudly after a backhand winner and increased aggression had an invigorating effect on Hewett, whose smash earned Britain a break to love at the start of the second set. Hewett was still vulnerable on serve, however, and he was broken again after a peach of a volley from Houdet, who has won 14 grand slam doubles titles.</p> <p>Now the danger was that France would take control, only for Britain to break again in the sixth game. At the fourth time of asking an inspired Hewett held at last for 5-2. But then it was Reid\u2019s turn to falter when he served for the second set in the ninth game, sending a forehand long and hitting his racket in frustration.</p> <p>When Hewett brought up a set point with a ripped forehand in the 10th game Reid made amends, tapping away a volley to level the match.</p> <p>Yet France were too strong in the decider, breaking four times and sealing their victory when Peifer put a deft volley out of reach.</p> <p>Reid and Hewett do not have long to get over their disappointment.</p>",

  "<p>Council leaders are calling on the government to give them greater powers to check on the growing number of children who are apparently being home-educated \u2013 a trend that is thought to be linked to a rise in the number of illegal schools across England.<br></p> <p>The schools watchdog <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/may/16/ofsted-finds-100-suspected-illegal-schools-in-england\">Ofsted has previously said</a> unregistered schools are exploiting the rules on home education. The Local Government Association (LGA), which represents more than 370 councils in England and Wales, wants local authorities to be given powers to enter homes and premises to check on the suitability of education being offered.</p> <p>It also wants to be able to compel parents to register home-educated children to help councils monitor their education and prevent children from disappearing under the radar. The LGA raised concerns that some illegal schools had been linked to the teaching of extremist views.</p> <p>Richard Watts, chair of the LGA\u2019s children and young people board, said the majority of parents who home-educated their children worked well with their local council to ensure a good education for their child.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>\u201cHowever, in some cases, a child listed as home-schooled can in fact be attending an illegal school. With limited powers to check on the work a child is doing, however, councils are unable to find out whether this is the case.\u201d<br></p> <p>In recent months Ofsted inspectors have launched a crackdown on what they say is a <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2015/nov/10/ofsted-raises-alarm-over-squalid-illegal-schools\">growing number of illegal or unregistered schools</a>, some of which have been found operating in unsafe and unhygienic premises, run by staff who have not been vetted.</p> <p>The chief inspector of schools, Sir Michael Wilshaw, has claimed that some unregistered schools are \u201cusing the freedoms that parents have to home-educate their children as a cover for their activities\u201d and are exploiting weaknesses in the current legislation to \u201coperate on the cusp of the law\u201d.</p> <p>Any parent has the right to withdraw their child from mainstream education, and they do not have to give a reason for doing so. Other children remain hidden from the authorities because they have never been to school. Council officials can enter premises to check up on the education of a child only if they have specific concerns about a child\u2019s safety.</p> <p>Colin Diamond, the executive director for education in Birmingham, said a number of illegal schools in the city had been closed down in the last year after joint inspections by Ofsted and the council. </p> <p>He said he was particularly concerned about the regulation of elective home education (EHE) \u2013 where parents decide to provide education for their child at home rather than sending them to school \u2013 which he believes is inadequate.</p> <p>\u201cWe feel that any EHE learning situation potentially puts a child in a very vulnerable position,\u201d said Diamond. \u201cWe recognise that parents elect to educate their children at home for a very wide range of reasons, and in many cases they do a great job.</p> <p>\u201cBut because the child is isolated, they are not visible to their peer group and professionals don\u2019t keep an eye on them, we would like more powers to be able to make sure every child who is EHE is safe, well and learning well.\u201d</p> <p>At the moment 900 children are registered as EHE in Birmingham. \u201cThose numbers have been growing in the last couple of years. We are very interested in finding out the deeper reasons why,\u201d said Diamond. </p> <p>Figures obtained by the <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-35133119\">BBC</a> through freedom of information requests last December found a 65% increase in children recorded as home-educated over the last six years \u2013 an increase of more than 10,000 pupils, to almost 37,000, in a population of around 9.5 million pupils.</p> <p>Wilshaw said in May that more than 100 suspected unregistered schools had been uncovered by inspectors in a five-month period. \u201cEvidence inspectors have gathered over recent weeks has reaffirmed my belief that there is a clear link between the growth of unregistered schools and the steep rise in the number of children recorded as being home-educated in England over the past few years,\u201d he wrote in a letter to the then education secretary, Nicky Morgan.</p> <p>Diamond said one of the reasons families were choosing not to use state schools was that they wanted their daughters taught separately from boys. Others reasons included concerns about bullying in schools or special educational needs not being adequately met.</p> <p>He called for local authorities to be given more powers to oversee <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/oct/07/muslim-leaders-voice-concerns-about-tory-crackdown-on-madrasas\">supplementary schools</a> \u2013 many of them faith-based \u2013 which typically hold classes in the evening and are not required to be inspected. \u201cAs education gets more complex and fragmented, local authorities are in that unique position of being able to hold it together locally on the ground,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Trevor Holden, chief executive of Luton borough council, echoed the concerns from Birmingham. \u201cIn an ideal world we would look for a change in regulations which require parents to register their children with the local authority, and an urgent review of the powers available to close unregistered or inappropriate schools, should they be discovered,\u201d he said.</p> <p>In Luton the council has raised concerns with Ofsted about two schools. One has since closed, while the other remains open because of confusion over whether it is a full-time school \u2013 and therefore susceptible to regulation \u2013 or a part-time tutoring centre.</p> <p>\u201cThis is a really, really important safeguarding issue,\u201d said Holden. \u201cThe current regulations do not deal with the complex modern educational landscape.\u201d</p> <p>A Department for Education spokesperson said: \u201cIt is unacceptable for any child of compulsory school age not to be receiving a suitable education. We recognise parents may choose to home school their children and many do a good job, but it must be of a suitable quality. That\u2019s why we have taken steps to ensure the system is as robust as it can be when it comes to protecting young people, while at the same time safeguarding the rights of parents to determine how and where to educate their children.</p> <p>\u201cWe are also clear that unregistered schools are illegal and unsafe and we are cracking down on them. We have announced an escalation of Ofsted investigations into unregistered schools, with additional inspectors dedicated to rooting them out, a new tougher approach to prosecuting them and a call to local authorities to help identify any settings of concern.\u201d</p>",

The big question is can Claude Puel\u2019s team emulate Lawrie McMenemy\u2019s 1974 Texaco Cup heroes, who bravely fell at the last hurdle to Newcastle United (the same club, as it happened, who had ended their very first European expedition in 1970). Despite the 1974 feat \u2013 which, lest we forget, included a semi-final triumph over Oldham Athletic - it\u2019s fair to say that Southampton\u2019s European pedigree is less than rich and they could do with embellishing it this season, especially after last year\u2019s ignominious failure against Midtjylland. Being in a group with Sparta Prague, Internazionale and Hapoel Beer\u2019sheva gives them a chance to add a bit of lustre to their international record.</p> <p>Today\u2019s game is also an opportunity for Southampton to get their first victory under Puel, who has not exactly wowed folks on the south coast so far and has been sabotaged by some bad luck (such as the injury to Sofiane Boufal and that absurd penalty decision at the Emirates last weekend). No need for alarm just yet, but Southampton fans would certainly welcome more evidence that the new manager has a plan that will fly. He\u2019ll need to realise that Nathan Redmond-as-striker wheeze just isn\u2019t going to cut it, for instance. He\u2019s deviated from it for this match, at least, as he\u2019s made seven personnel changes to deploy a slightly novel lineup, with Van Dijk the only first-choice defender to start. Austin and Long are together up front in it would be encouraging if they clicked.</p> <p>Sparta are unlikely to make it easy for the hosts. The Czechs did well in this tournament last season, emerging from their group unbeaten before ousting Bayer Leverkusen and Lazio and eventually losing to Villarreal in the quarter-finals. They were hoping to not to be in the tournament again this season but had to make do with it after losing to Steaua Bucharest in the qualifying round for the Champions League. They are paupers compared to the Premier League club but have some players who could enable them to upset the established order, notably the attacking midfielder. All in all, then, this could be an enjoyable contest. To get you in the mood, here\u2019s some footage of when Southampton hosted Sporting Lisbon back in 1981. Don\u2019t be too concerned about your team\u2019s defending, Saints\u2019 fans, just look at those kits: smooth.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R9gAzAi55EI\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/R9gAzAi55EI?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>  </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-09-15T18:26:16.142Z\">at 7.26pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57da836be4b0e813b694d47b\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-15T11:18:10.094Z\">12.18pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">TEAMS:</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Southampton</strong>: Forster; Martina, Yoshida, Van Dijk, Targett; Tadic, Romeu, Hojberg, Ward-Prowse; Austin, Long.</p> <p><em><strong>Subs</strong>: McCarthy, Fonte, Bertrand, Clasie, Davis, Rodriguez, Redmond.</em></p> <p><strong>Sparta</strong>: Koubek; Holek, Costa, Kadlec, Karavaev, Frydek, Sacek, Vacha, Sural, Julis, Kadlec.</p> <p><em><strong>Subs</strong>: Bicik, Mazuch, Marecek, Cermak, Lafata, Holzer, Pulkrab.</em></p> <p><strong>Ref</strong>: Manuel Grafe (Germany)</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-09-15T19:20:40.952Z\">at 8.20pm BST</time></p>  </div>",
  "<p>Two England caps, two hat-tricks, both against Estonia but 12 months apart: the Arsenal striker Danielle Carter has not been injured in the meantime but had failed until Thursday night to convince the head coach, Mark Sampson, that she should be in his team. Perhaps that will change after another sharp-shooting display.</p> <p>The 23-year-old Carter was one of three England strikers who were virtual newcomers to senior international football as Estonia were brushed aside in the penultimate Euro 17 qualifier for Sampson\u2019s team.</p> <p>Carter and Manchester City\u2019s Nikita Parris, who also started this one-sided affair, had only three caps between them before the game while the substitute Rachel Daly, who plays her club football in America for Houston Dash, had made only one appearance.</p> <p>But it mattered not against an Estonian team 80 places below England in the world rankings who have lost all eight of their qualifying group games. England, in contrast, have remained unbeaten in seven.</p> <p>Maintaining that record was never an issue against Estonia, whose English manager, Keith Boanas, is set to quit his role and return home when his contract expires later this year. The former Charlton Athletic boss looked a lonely figure in the technical area as his side took another heavy beating.</p> <p>England won three corners in the first 90 seconds and the only surprise was that it took until the ninth minute for the opening goal to arrive, Carter drilling in a low shot from the edge of the penalty area.</p> <p>The Manchester City midfielder Jill Scott headed in the second goal after 13 minutes and four minutes later the game was over as a contest when Carter tapped home her second from a Parris cross.</p> <p>Parris, who had scored two goals in her first two appearances, squandered good chances each side of half-time but then Carter completed her hat-trick with a 12-yard shot following a Karen Carney free-kick. And a stoppage time penalty by the Chelsea winger completed another good Euro night for England.</p> <p>Having already clinched qualification for next year\u2019s finals in the Netherlands, England regained top spot in Group 7 after being overtaken briefly by Belgium, who had won 3-1 in Serbia earlier in the day.</p> <p>A draw with Belgium in the last of the group\u2019s matches, in Leuven on Tuesday, would be enough for Sampson\u2019s team to finish top with an unbeaten record.</p> <p>But having had their 100% record spoiled in a 1-1 stalemate with the Belgians at Rotherham in May, Sampson and his players will be determined to end the campaign on a winning note.</p>",

Sergei Nikitin, a digital forensic analyst at the Moscow-based security company Group-IB, said not enough information was available to trace the attacks to Russia. He said companies usually publish a report with more exact evidence on how exactly their system was compromised.</p> <p>\u201cWe don\u2019t have this in the case of the DNC and Wada hacks, so it\u2019s not clear on what basis conclusions are being drawn that Russian hackers or special services were involved.

Since it\u2019s enthusiasts, amateurs, they got what they got and went public with it.\u201d</p> <p>But leading cyber security firms have long been finding patterns in Fancy Bears\u2019 activities that give them confidence the hackers are linked to the Russian state. The group, which is also known as APT28, Strontium or Sofacy, has been active since at least 2008 but increased its activities tenfold in 2015, according to Kaspersky Labs. It said in a statement to the Guardian that Fancy Bears is a Russian-speaking group focusing on \u201cNato countries, Ukraine, governments and military contractors\u201d, targets that have tense relations with the Kremlin. Crowdstrike has said Fancy Bears is likely tied to the GRU, Russia\u2019s military intelligence agency.</p> <p>Since the Wada breach was a result of a phishing attack, in which deceptive emails entice users to reveal their passwords, the attackers did not employ malware that could be checked against that typically used by Russian groups. But the US security firm ThreatConnect said the way the phishing was carried out was consistent with Fancy Bears\u2019 past activities.</p> <p>In creating phishing emails, the Wada attacker registered domain names with the same domain registrar Fancy Bears used in the DNC hack, as well as another domain registrar often used by Fancy Bears, according to a ThreatConnect report. The domains were registered shortly after Russian Olympic and Paralympic athletes were banned from competing in Rio de Janeiro, and the deceptive email addresses were written with a formula used by Fancy Bears before.</p> <p>Nikitin said Fancy Bear was most likely a criminal group leaking politically sensitive information to get \u201cfree advertising\u201d in the media for its blackmarket services.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/sep/15/fancy-bears-chris-froome-bradley-wiggins-tues-cycling\">Wiggins and Froome leaks raise familiar questions for cycling but do little else</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But Toni Gidwani, ThreatConnect\u2019s director of research, said whereas cyber criminals will target many people in the hopes of finding easy scores, Fancy Bear had a history of tailoring its attacks to specific targets and, having breached them, lingering on their servers gathering information. \u201cWe\u2019re pretty comfortable that Fancy Bear is linked to the Russian government, taking what we know about their attacks on the whole,\u201d Gidwani said. \u201cThe level of complexity we see them pull off in these attacks, it would be very difficult for this organisation to be criminally motivated or an ideological hacktivist.\u201d</p> <p>The new ostentatious Fancy Bears website, the leak of Wada data on the Russian Olympic boxer Misha Aloyan and the claim by a Twitter account calling itself Anonymous Poland that it was targeting Wada and Cas were not typical of a Russian state hacker group, Gidwani admitted. But she said the people doing the hacking and those leaking the information could be different and called new accounts claiming credit for the attacks \u201cfaketivists\u201d meant to throw investigators off the scent.</p> <p>Gidwani said the suspected Russia-backed attacks would likely continue until at least the US presidential election: \u201cIt\u2019s almost like Joker in Batman, to cause as much chaos as possible and cause people to question the integrity of these systems, whether that\u2019s the US elections and our leadership or international structures that regulate doping in sport.\u201d</p>",

In today\u2019s announcement, the business secretary, Greg Clark, highlighted that the go-ahead for Hinkley was subject to two conditions. One is that the UK government keeps a golden share in Hinkley and similar projects; the other is that ownership of key national assets will be subject to a national security test.<br><br></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video element--supporting\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/video/2016/sep/15/hinkley-point-c-nuclear-power-plant-gets-green-light-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/535y2\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2720468\"            data-video-name=\"Hinkley Point C nuclear power plant gets green light \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"Reuters/AP\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-57da6ff2e4b0e813b694d401\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/09/15/160915hinkley_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/09/15/160915hinkley.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/09/15/160915hinkley_WebM.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/video/2016/sep/15/hinkley-point-c-nuclear-power-plant-gets-green-light-video\">Hinkley Point C nuclear power plant gets green light</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>These conditions should be seen as more than mere window dressing. True, similar conditions are the norm in many other major economies. True also, the British government possesses some powers of this kind already. Most people are likely to see them as utterly sensible. What is different, however, is the new political saliency given to such thinking, which accords to government an ineradicable place to act in the national interest. This suggests something bigger and deeper is changing in our politics.</p> <p>The insistence that government needs the power to exercise judicious control over the ownership of an industry in the national interest may seem sensible and moderate to most people. Yet it also seems revolutionary and radical. It is a break from a recent past in which global market forces have routinely been treated as the only secure basis for ownership decisions.</p> <p>Much the same goes for a requirement that a national security consideration be given to large infrastructure projects. This too sounds like common sense. Yet it needed saying. The UK\u2019s appetite for inward investment is now so large that even national security is being increasingly relegated to the margins.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"efae2e2d9bd34225b53fe2ad81c4b8dfd2a2706f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/efae2e2d9bd34225b53fe2ad81c4b8dfd2a2706f/305_0_2576_3008/856.jpg\" alt=\"The business secretary, Greg Clark, \u2018drew a line\u2019 under George Osborne\u2019s wish to be open for business - and \u2018began to push back\u2019.\" width=\"856\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The business secretary, Greg Clark, \u2018drew a line\u2019 under George Osborne\u2019s wish to be open for business - and \u2018began to push back\u2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Steve Back / Barcroft Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The re-examination of Hinkley is actually less important in terms of the substance of the deal than for these wider signals. It is one sign among many that the economic liberalism of the political right, which has been in such ascendancy since the 1980s, no longer eclipses all other considerations, including the human cost. Clark didn\u2019t bury George Osborne\u2019s wish to be open for business \u2013 what a vacuous phrase it is \u2013 even in sensitive sectors this week. But he drew a line under it and, in a limited way, began to push back.</p> <p>Not before time, many will say. Not yet enough, lots will add. Both observations are right. But we should nevertheless see this moment in our history for what it is. At the end of the 20th century, the triumph of capitalism and democracy seemed at one stage so complete that an era of global economic liberalism appeared to beckon. Today the folly of that delusion has been made obvious by the financial crisis and its political consequences.</p> <p>But it is not just the economic liberalism of the 80s that has hit rough water. So too has the socio-cultural liberalism of the 60s, with its belief in universal rights and the meaninglessness of difference. That form of liberalism has not been able to withstand the challenge of militant Islamism, with its denial of any universality except its own dogmas. The impact on liberal politics and liberal nation states continues to be immense, visible in Britain in everything from Brexit to the rise in state investigatory powers.</p> <p>Liberalism is a Hydra-headed and extremely resilient creature. There are also few words in the political dictionary that mean so many different things in different contexts. Most of us consider ourselves liberals in some respects but not in others. Adherents of 60s social liberalism are not necessarily adherents of 80s economic liberalism, or vice versa. Nor is either liberalism quite as absolutist as is sometimes claimed. Most people are somewhere on a spectrum of views, whether on social issues or economics.</p> <p>We should not pronounce the death of liberalism prematurely. Just because it is full of contradictions and cannot solve the problems of the age, it does not follow that liberalism is ignoble or that it is doomed to collapse \u2013 still less that there is some self-evidently superior alternative. Most people, at least in Britain, still seem prepared to support the liberal democratic order and many of the important liberal social and economic ideas on which it rests.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"316b197a19b120512f41e0a0fad6c7be03784fa1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/316b197a19b120512f41e0a0fad6c7be03784fa1/750_0_3077_3120/986.jpg\" alt=\"Theresa May in Downing Street after becoming prime minister: \u2018Her speeches, both before and after becoming prime minister, are unified by post-liberal thinking.\u2019\" width=\"986\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Theresa May in Downing Street after becoming prime minister: \u2018Her speeches, both before and after becoming prime minister, are unified by post-liberal thinking.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kirsty Wigglesworth/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Nevertheless, it is becoming increasingly useful to see ours not as a liberal age but as a post-liberal one. There has been a rumbling discussion about post-liberalism for some years, triggered not least by concerns about the weakening impact of migration on national social democracies. But it is striking that this week saw the publication of a book by <a href=\"http://www.rowmaninternational.com/books/the-politics-of-virtue\">John Milbank and Adrian Pabst</a>, which takes post-liberalism as an established reality and as the starting point for the examination of a new kind of politics based on a vision of social and personal virtue and what the authors dub conservative socialism.</p> <p>In Britain, the arrival of Theresa May in Downing Street in the wake of the Brexit vote is the most striking example of this shift. May is not an economic liberal like Margaret Thatcher or a social liberal like David Cameron. In fact, liberalism of any kind seems almost a marginal consideration in her thinking and her policy making. These are still early days, but May\u2019s speeches, both before and after becoming prime minister, are unified by post-liberal thinking.</p> <p>All of this poses a particular problem to the one party in British politics that proudly defines itself as liberal. The Liberal Democrats have more immediate hand-to-mouth concerns as they gather for their conference in Brighton than whether liberalism is in terminal eclipse. Nevertheless, in government between 2010 and 2015, the Lib Dems were the victims both of the crisis of economic liberalism, in the shape of austerity, and the crisis of social liberalism, in the rise of anti-migrant feeling articulated by Ukip. Liberals need to get real as well as feel sorry for themselves.</p> <p>As Milbank and Pabst stress, liberalism is certainly not inherently bad, but it does have defects and inherent problems. Brexit is in part a revolt against a set of characteristics of modern liberalism. We have a new political agenda that no political party can afford to ignore. Whether we consider ourselves liberal or not, we increasingly inhabit post-liberal times.</p>",
  "<p>Wisconsin governor Scott Walker broke his silence on Thursday over <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/14/corporate-cash-john-doe-files-scott-walker-wisconsin\">leaked documents obtained by Guardian US</a>, which revealed his links to a complex network of conservative donors and the influence of corporate cash in the election process.<br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2016/sep/14/john-doe-files-scott-walker-corporate-cash-american-politics\">Scott Walker, the John Doe files and how corporate cash influences American politics</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In an interview with Milwaukee\u2019s WTMJ 620, the Republican governor described as \u201cbaseless\u201d the legal investigation into alleged campaign finance violations that produced the 1,500 pages of documents.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s what we often see in media outlets where you get bits and pieces shaped to push their agenda,\u201d <a href=\"http://www.wtmj.com/shows/charlie-sykes/gov-scott-walker-addresses-john-doe-document-leak\">Walker said</a>. \u201cThe bottom line is we\u2019ve had several courts in this state that have shut this down, this baseless investigation down, because it clearly didn\u2019t show that what was done that was not lawful there.\u201d<br></p> <p>Known as the \u201cJohn Doe investigation\u201d, several Wisconsin prosecutors launched a probe into what they suspected were criminal campaign finance violations by the campaign committee of Walker, a former Republican presidential candidate who dropped out early in the primary race. The prosecutors claimed Walker\u2019s committee operated a coordinated network that involved outside lobby groups, thereby allowing unlimited amounts of corporate money to funnel into a third-party group closely aligned with his campaign. In July 2015, the Wisconsin supreme court halted the investigation.<br></p> <p>In saying prosecutors misunderstood campaign finance law to pick on people and groups \u201cwholly innocent of any wrongdoing\u201d, the state\u2019s high court took the extraordinary step to order all documents produced as part of the investigation to be destroyed and later held under seal \u2013 however at least one set survived that was leaked to Guardian US.<br></p> <p>Walker told the radio station that unspecified people related to the investigation who \u201close in the court of law, repeatedly\u201d now \u201cwant to play this out in the court of public opinion \u2013 and do so with only bits and pieces, without the full story\u201d.<br></p> <p>\u201cThe bottom line is that people, not only at the supreme court level, but even initially at the circuit court level, where a distinguished reserve judge \u2013 who, as far as we can tell, has no aligned political allegiance with anyone \u2013 initially shut this down,\u201d Walker said. \u201cAnd that assertion\u2019s been held many times over.\u201d<br></p> <p>Charlie Sykes of WTMJ then proceeded to ask Walker about headlines on Wednesday following <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/14/corporate-cash-john-doe-files-scott-walker-wisconsin\">the John Doe leak</a>, particularly that Wisconsin\u2019s Republican-controlled legislature in 2013 passed new laws making it difficult for victims of lead paint poisoning to file lawsuits against lead producers, following a $750,000 donation to a group aligned with the governor.<br></p> <p>Walker said the donation was irrelevant to his support for the lead law.<br></p> <p>\u201cThe shocking thing for many,\u201d Walker said, \u201cmight be that people actually in elected office do the things they\u2019ve said. I, and plenty of others in the legislature, have said for years \u2013 almost a decade or more now \u2013 that lawsuit reform was an important issue in the state.\u201d </p> <p>The governor said he disagreed with a previous court ruling \u201cthat said you can be sued as an employer, even if there\u2019s no evidence your company had anything to do with what they\u2019re suing about\u201d.<br></p> <p>\u201cWe thought that was wrong, we thought that sent a bad sentiment,\u201d Walker said. \u201cWe thought that would discourage people hiring people in the state of Wisconsin, and bring business to the state.\u201d<br></p> <p>The leak prompted Milwaukee County district attorney John Chisholm, a Democrat who launched the John Doe investigation, on Wednesday <a href=\"http://host.madison.com/wsj/news/local/govt-and-politics/leaked-john-doe-documents-paint-fuller-picture-of-case-against/article_63254ac5-dbf2-5b4b-8714-4dd6694da9a9.html\">to proclaim his support</a> for determining the source of the leak, and said it\u2019s \u201cnot merely a violation of the John Doe secrecy order, it\u2019s a crime under Wisconsin law\u201d.<br></p> <p>In his interview, Walker echoed the sentiment. \u201cI think those involved in law enforcement in this state \u2013 if they want people to take seriously the order of the court \u2013 should certainly do that, no matter what the issue is,\u201d he said. \u201cOtherwise, what kind of system do we live in?</p> <p>\u201cAs I mentioned, in this case, the worst part about it is, they\u2019ve lost in the court of law because several courts have said this is a baseless investigation, and yet, now, they\u2019re trying to leak bits and pieces of it in the court of opinion, without people knowing all the facts.</p> <p>\u201cAnd the things people should focus in on,\u201d he continued, \u201care the fact this has been shut down, because they couldn\u2019t provide a basis for showing anything was illegal.\u201d <br></p> <p>The US supreme court will consider later this month a petition from the prosecutors asking for a full review of the decision to shut their case down.</p>",

  "<p>It was just past sunset on 22 October 1989 when 11-year-old Jacob Wetterling along with his little brother and best friend rode their bikes to a video store down the road in rural Minnesota. They were on their way home when a masked man grabbed Jacob and disappeared with him. Jacob was never seen again.<br></p> <p>For almost 27 years, the mystery of what happened to Jacob haunted not only the small town of St Joseph, Minnesota, but the state and the country. His kidnapping put the fear of so-called \u201cstranger danger\u201d into the hearts and minds of parents across the country and led to legislation that created the sex-offender registry. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/04/jacob-wetterling-remains-of-boy-missing-for-27-years-are-found-in-minnesota\">Jacob Wetterling: remains of boy missing for 27 years are found in Minnesota</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cThis is a case that in many ways changed American childhood,\u201d said Peabody award-winning investigative reporter <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/madeleine-baran-b765a024\">Madeleine Baran</a>. \u201cIt made parents across the country afraid to let their kids out of their sight, because if this could happen in the small town of St Joseph, Minnesota, this could happen anywhere.\u201d Despite the attention and a mass search, Jacob\u2019s body wasn\u2019t found. His parents never knew whether he was alive or dead; they feared the worst while keeping their hope alive for almost three decades.<br></p> <p>Last year, Baran and American Public Media\u2019s investigative and documentary unit, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/apmreports\">APM Reports</a>, decided to make a <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/id1148175292\">podcast about his disappearance</a>. \u201cThis case changed the lives of millions of Americans, and it\u2019s a case that\u2019s not actually well understood,\u201d Baran said. \u201cFrom my initial reporting, it\u2019s a case that seems like it should have been solved so much sooner.\u201d They wanted answers about the initial investigation, why the case was never solved, and why Jacob was never found, dead or alive. The team spent almost nine months embedded in the case, tracing the police investigation, interviewing witnesses \u2013 some of whom the police never spoke to \u2013 and trying to answer two questions: what happened in the case and, more importantly, where was Jacob? </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>From my initial reporting, it\u2019s a case that seems like it should have been solved so much sooner</p> <footer> <cite>Madeleine Baran</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Soon after the podcast, <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/id1148175292\">called In the Dark</a>, was announced, it climbed the iTunes charts thanks to true crime fans subscribing early, eager to sate their desire for the next <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/serial\">Serial</a>. Then, a week before the first episode was set to be released, the case was solved. Danny Heinrich, a sex offender facing child pornography charges, made a deal that included confessing that he had kidnapped Jacob, sexually assaulted him, killed him and buried his body in a field. Heinrich led investigators to Jacob\u2019s body. </p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/06/jacob-wetterling-killing-minnesota-danny-heinrich-admits\">The news of Heinrich\u2019s confession </a>wasn\u2019t a surprise to those closely involved in the case, including the team behind In the Dark. \u201cWe thought it was possible that this man Danny Heinrich could confess. He\u2019d been in jail for almost a year on child porn charges and he was someone who had been looked at for a long time in connection with the case, so yes, it wasn\u2019t a complete surprise,\u201d Baran said.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/sep/06/jacob-wetterling-killing-mother-time-to-heal-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/52vdj\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2696941\"            data-video-name=\"Mother of Jacob Wetterling needs 'time to heal' after 27-year ordeal \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"Reuters\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-57cf32ace4b08603a349257c\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/09/06/160906mom_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/09/06/160906mom.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/09/06/160906mom_WebM.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/sep/06/jacob-wetterling-killing-mother-time-to-heal-video\">Mother of Jacob Wetterling needs \u2018time to heal\u2019 after 27-year ordeal</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>While everyone involved in the case was glad to finally have answers, the sudden resolution changed the plans for the podcast. \u201cWe were pretty close to finishing up all eight episodes,\u201d Baran said. When the news about Heinrich broke, they decided to release the first two episodes of the show early \u2013 after they recorded a new introduction that addressed the sudden developments. \u201cWe thought it was important to go a little bit early for the first two episodes just so people would have that information sooner, especially in Minnesota where the case has been so closely watched,\u201d Baran said. </p> <p>Because the kidnapping was still an ongoing investigation, Baran and her team didn\u2019t have access to the police file while making the podcast. Instead they had to work assiduously to find out everything they could about the case, re-interviewing witnesses, and unearthing information that had never been made public before. That worked in their favor when Heinrich made his confession, because they already knew many of the facts of the case. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>In the Dark was not created as a whodunit, but rather as a 'why didn\u2019t they solve it?'</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>That meant only minimal editing was necessary to address the breaking news and get the podcast out early. \u201cIt did not require complete rethinking of the podcast, the episodes are basically the same they\u2019re just additional things that we\u2019re adding here and there,\u201d Baran said. \u201cWe had been working on this for so long and we basically knew what we were going to say. We were not scrambling to try to put something together. If this had been your standard true crime mystery podcast where we were trying to figure out who kidnapped Jacob, then the changes would have been considerable, but that was not our theme.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"f0be10da3afcfe4111fca25435e0226d19438601\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f0be10da3afcfe4111fca25435e0226d19438601/0_123_3600_2160/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Minnesota guardsmen searched woods and fields hear the abduction site of Jacob Wetterling in 1989.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Minnesota guardsmen searched woods and fields hear the abduction site of Jacob Wetterling in 1989.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy Stock Photo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In the Dark was not created as a whodunnit, but rather as a \u201cwhy didn\u2019t they solve it?\u201d Instead, the show investigated the investigators, looked for missed opportunities, and searched for answers about why it took almost three decades for the case to be solved \u2013 especially because Heinrich was already on police radar and was by no means a criminal mastermind. When the news came that Heinrich was making a confession, Baran sat in the courthouse listening and <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/jun/22/untold-daniel-morgan-murder-britains-dirtiest-cover-up-has-become-a-must-listen-podcast\">marking possible missed opportunities by law enforcement</a>. \u201cIt confirmed a lot of what we had reported,\u201d she said. \u201cTo have Danny Heinrich right there in court describing exactly what he did was helpful to me as a reporter to try to solve this puzzle, not just of who kidnapped Jacob, but of why it was not solved sooner.\u201d For Baran, that\u2019s the crux of the podcast \u2013 asking why law enforcement was never able to crack the case.</p> <p>\u201cThis was not a case of the Wetterlings saying that that they wanted this looked into because of poor law enforcement \u2013 they just wanted to find their son,\u201d Baran said. \u201cI think that the Wetterlings have always wanted us to find Jacob, in the hope that Jacob was still alive. Now Jacob has finally been found and it\u2019s up to us the reporters to ask the questions of law enforcement about what could have been done differently.\u201d </p> <p>\u201cI think it\u2019s really important in these types of cases for the public to look critically at law enforcement,\u201d Baran added. \u201cA lot of attention is paid to the criminal, but we should also pay attention to law enforcement \u2026 It\u2019s the job of law enforcement to solve that case. I hope that this podcast generates interest to people across the country to start asking some tough questions about, \u2018What are the big cases in my area that are not solved and what did law enforcement do in those cases?\u2019\u201d</p>",
  "<p>A gorgeous July day in Paris, the haute couture shows are in full swing and the <a href=\"http://www.fourseasons.com/paris/\">Four Seasons hotel</a> is in glamour lockdown. A motorcade of buffed, black, presidential-scale cars lines the kerb outside its street entrance, currently occupied by two women in red-carpet hair and makeup who have paused at the exit for a prolonged session with a selfie stick. Inside, a chandelier the size of a meteorite twinkles above a vast expanse of black and white marble floor, the airy space punctuated by urns crowded with triffid-sized white gladioli, reed slender and supermodel height.</p> <p>In other words, the scene is perfectly set for the entrance of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2016/jan/09/olivier-rousteing-balmain-rihanna-fashion-paris\">Olivier Rousteing</a>, Balmain\u2019s creative director and Paris fashion\u2019s most glamorous frontman. Except, of course, he isn\u2019t here yet, because I am 10 minutes early and he \u2013 like any self-respecting rock star \u2013 will be 20 minutes late. The restaurant is mostly empty, the diners having spilled out into the courtyard for post-lunch cigarettes and espresso, so I sip a Diet Coke served with elaborate ceremony by a waitress in a cocktail dress, and wait.</p> <p>And then here he is. He is in a black fedora, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/keithrichards\">Keith Richards</a> vibes, a sharp Balmain blazer with sleeves pushed up to the elbow. His chunky black and gold Rolex is exactly the watch <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/tutankhamun\">Tutankhamun</a> would have worn, were he to be reincarnated in 2016. Skinny jeans, biker boots, a black T-shirt faded to the perfect sultry charcoal. His sunglasses are enormous, the size of lab goggles. There is an awkward moment when he sits down opposite me and I think he isn\u2019t going to take them off, but then he does, flashing me the wide, slightly distancing smile of the very beautiful, the smile of a man accustomed to being admired.</p> <p>He is ridiculously good-looking. <a href=\"https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=zoolander&amp;espv=2&amp;biw=1858&amp;bih=1280&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjwhfu2_6nOAhXkIMAKHWA3DeMQ_AUIBigB&amp;dpr=1\">Zoolander</a> good-looking. Poreless skin, worked-out body, cheekbones for days. And while being good-looking has never been part of the job description for a traditional fashion designer, that is the point, because Rousteing is very much a non-traditional fashion designer. He is mixed race. He loves <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/higher-education-network/2016/jan/14/whats-wrong-with-studying-the-kardashians\">the Kardashians</a>. He posts <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/olivier_rousteing/?hl=en\">endless selfies</a>. And he has reinvented the house founded by <a href=\"http://www.balmain.com/en_au/heritage\">Pierre Balmain</a> in 1945 as a new kind of fashion enterprise, one that \u201cis very pop, but communicates like a luxury brand\u201d. He is not always adored by the critics (of which more later). But can 3.8 million Instagram followers be wrong?</p> <p>The industry is scathing about designers who pour their creative energies into their celebrity friendships and social media feeds, but Rousteing turns this on its head. He tells me the moment his creativity stepped up a notch was five years ago, when he moved from behind the scenes at Balmain to replace <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2011/apr/06/christophe-decarnin-fashion-balmain\">Christophe Decarnin</a> as creative director. \u201cThat was a big step,\u201d he says. \u201cSchool can teach you to be a great \u2018designer\u2019\u201d \u2013 he puts ironic speech marks around the word with his fingers, as if to suggest being a designer isn\u2019t really a proper job \u2013 \u201cbut there is so much more to being a creative director.\u201d This job title, by contrast, he says in reverential tones. \u201cIt means overseeing everything from the business to the fittings to the campaign to the stores. It means having a vision.\u201d Where the traditionalists of Paris revere the role of designer and roll their eyes at that of creative director, Rousteing does the opposite.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8d4ccb93a94e5753cbf81c70afe27a337637fb58\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8d4ccb93a94e5753cbf81c70afe27a337637fb58/0_0_3000_2001/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Olivier Rousteing backstage at Paris Fashion week with bosom buddies Kanye West, Kim Kardashian, Kendall Jenner and Kris Jenner.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Olivier Rousteing backstage at Paris fashion week with bosom buddies Kanye West, Kim Kardashian, Kendall Jenner and Kris Jenner.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Michel Dufour/WireImage</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Frankly, Rousteing\u2019s Balmain frightens the life out of the fashion establishment, particularly in Paris, where a few blue-chip family names \u2013 Gainsbourg, Deneuve, de la Fressange, de la Falaise \u2013 have for decades ruled the front row like a quaint oligarchy. Rousteing, by contrast, has forged an alliance with the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/kim-kardashian\">Kardashian</a>-<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/kanyewest\">West</a>s, an American family who have built a multimillion global empire on sex tapes and nude selfies. To use an analogy with a suitable level of cultural bling, Olivier Rousteing is to the Kardashians what <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/botticelli\">Sandro Botticelli</a> was to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2010/may/08/great-dynasties-medici-family\">the Medici family</a>. Critics who dismiss Balmain\u2019s dresses as vulgar because they are made for Kim Kardashian might bear in mind that Botticelli painted <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/picture/2012/mar/19/sandro-botticelli-primavera-spring-artworks\">Primavera</a> for the Medicis.</p> <p>The Balmain aesthetic is tight, bright and leggy. It is a rarefied, artisan-embroidered, exquisitely tailored version of an aesthetic instantly recognisable by any 18-year-old as Friday-night partywear. \u201cSome people feel luxury shouldn\u2019t look like what the masses like,\u201d Rousteing says. \u201cThey feel it should be more elitist. But Balmain talks to young people. It\u2019s not about selling to them, it\u2019s about making them part of my world. And the people who can afford to buy luxury fashion, today those women want to feel young. So Balmain is pop, but it is a luxury brand as well. I don\u2019t think you have to make sad, complicated clothes to show you have depth.\u201d The aesthetic is accessible, but the prices are stratospheric \u2013 so high that they make Balmain feel aspirational in an abstract way. Like diamonds, or skiing holidays.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ca3fe1c030ebd1e618944b35b4e401ae2b0e6c78\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ca3fe1c030ebd1e618944b35b4e401ae2b0e6c78/0_0_2550_3000/850.jpg\" alt=\"Olivier Rousteing hanging out with his buddy, the singer Justin Bieber, at a gala at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City.\" width=\"850\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Olivier Rousteing hanging out with Justin Bieber at the Met Ball in New York.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dimitrios Kambouris/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Together, Rousteing, the Kardashians and a \u201cBalmain army\u201d of I\u2019m-with-the-brand model-groupies have staged a coup over the fashion establishment as gamechanging as it is glamorous, in which the traditional gatekeepers of taste are bypassed. Consider, for example, how Balmain\u2019s autumn/winter 2016 collection has made it into the public consciousness. When Kardashian-clan supermodel and Rousteing\u2019s close friend <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/kendalljenner/?hl=en\">Kendall Jenner</a> opened and closed the show in March, she shared the moment with her 63 million Instagram followers. (It pains me to say it, but with that kind of instant reach, it arguably doesn\u2019t matter whether newspaper critics like your show.) In July, Kanye West and Rousteing jointly released a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LsA84bXrBZw\">music video for West\u2019s single Wolves</a> which doubled as the Balmain autumn/winter 2016 campaign video, featuring Kim Kardashian and models including <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/joansmalls/?hl=en\">Joan Smalls</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/jan/10/jourdan-dunn-crush-of-week\">Jourdan Dunn</a> and <a href=\"http://alessandraambrosio.com/main2.htm\">Alessandra Ambrosio</a> wearing the collection. \u201cWith music, you talk to an entire generation, where sometimes with fashion, you don\u2019t talk to an entire generation because not everybody gets magazines,\u201d <a href=\"http://www.vogue.com/13462487/kanye-west-wolves-music-video-balmain-fall-2016-campaign/\">Rousteing told Vogue</a>. Within two days, the video had been watched five million times on YouTube.</p> <p>Yet when we meet, two weeks before the video will be released, Rousteing is in sensitive mood. In particular, and awkwardly, he is fed up with critics, who he feels disparage his work.</p> <p>\u201cThe reality of fashion is that the more success you have, the more haters you get. I am talking about journalists. But I understand that I will not always be loved in fashion, and that the only thing that matters is the business I am building. So, I don\u2019t care.\u201d I am not entirely convinced of the veracity of this sentence, especially when he continues, \u201cYou can dislike my show, but don\u2019t come to my show and then write 20 lines about how my face looks on Instagram! If that\u2019s what you want to write, don\u2019t bother coming to see six months\u2019 hard work. Just stay home!\u201d</p> <p>Haters? It is a word a pop star would use, not a fashion designer. But then that is Rousteing\u2019s world. Earlier that day, I visited the Balmain showroom to see the resort collection, some of which had been showcased during the menswear show the week before. One fringed and latticed leather coatdress in cornflower blue looked familiar: <a href=\"http://www.instyle.com/news/rihanna-balmain-party-dress\">Rihanna had already worn it</a> on a night out in London, a couple of days after the show, at which it had been well-documented by the paparazzi. I asked Rousteing how that came about.</p> <p>\u201cThe night of the show, she [Rihanna] texted me and she was like, \u2018Babe, I love that show, so beautiful, it was amazing.\u2019 So I texted back, \u2018What do you like?\u2019 and she sent me a picture of the blue coat and I was like, \u2018OK, I\u2019ll send it tomorrow.\u2019 There is no strategy. It comes from a text, from love and friendship. I don\u2019t need PRs.\u201d At this point he remembers his PR is sitting next to him and says, \u201cI mean, of course I need PR. But I don\u2019t need them for that.\u201d His PR, sanguine, concurs. \u201cWhen you see someone wearing Balmain, there\u2019s no contract. It\u2019s a real relationship, and that\u2019s the magic.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1fec7a7a49e77a5a2e7894ade6533b3809b23b6d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1fec7a7a49e77a5a2e7894ade6533b3809b23b6d/0_0_3016_4642/650.jpg\" alt=\"Rihanna wore a Balmain outfit to a fragrance launch in Paris just a few days after it was first shown on the catwalk.\" width=\"650\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rihanna wore a Balmain outfit to a fragrance launch in Paris just a few days after it was first shown on the catwalk.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Fisher/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Rousteing has sufficient star quality not just to get his clothes in paparazzi photographs, but to be in the frame himself. There is <a href=\"http://mobile.nytimes.com/slideshow/2016/05/05/fashion/beyonce-taylor-swift-kanye-west-kardashian-met-gala-/s/05AFTERPARTIES-slide-0BFX.html?_r=0\">a striking photograph</a> of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/beyonce\">Beyonc\u00e9</a> from this year\u2019s Met Ball after party, in which she is lounging on a velvet sofa, gazing at Rousteing next to her, who is talking and gesticulating, feet pulled up on the sofa as if he owns the place. Rousteing wants to be the face of Balmain, because that is \u201ca positive message\u201d, he says. He spent the first year of his life in an orphanage before being adopted by a middle-class white couple, who brought him up in Bordeaux. \u201cDiverse is a word that is really important to me,\u201d he says. \u201cI want to show that no matter your background, no matter what colour you are, where you come from, you can feel part of Balmain.\u201d He is a committed activist for diversity in fashion, consistently casting a range of ethnicities for his catwalks and ad campaigns, and appearing <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sC-n7V2uUc8\">on Newsnight</a> <a href=\"http://edition.cnn.com/videos/fashion/2015/09/29/olivier-rousteing-guest-editor-style.cnn/video/playlists/cnn-style-fashion-videos/\">and CNN</a> to challenge the fashion industry\u2019s lack of diversity.</p> <p>Rousteing began his career in Italy, where he spent five years at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2013/apr/13/roberto-cavalli-this-much-i-know\">Roberto Cavalli</a> before moving back to France. For two years, he worked closely with Decarnin, adored by the French Vogue in-crowd for his haute-grunge aesthetic of insanely expensive ripped jeans, before stepping up to replace him in 2011 at the age of just 24. Between 2013 and 2015 revenue grew by 50% \u2013 but this tells only half the story. Balmain\u2019s new celebrity firepower brought it a vast slice of the fashion bandwidth, and this new status as an industry headliner brought about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/gallery/2015/oct/15/balmain-x-hm-collaboration-the-first-look\">the collaboration with H&amp;M</a> last year, which made the brand a household name. In June this year, Mayhoola, the Qatari private investment company that owns Valentino, announced <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2016/jun/22/fashion-house-balmain-sold-to-qatars-mayhoola-sovereign-wealth-fund\">the acquisition of Balmain</a>, with a view to growing the brand.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e6ec0c4dad176647d029ad22c698c9f09f3de888\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e6ec0c4dad176647d029ad22c698c9f09f3de888/0_855_3280_3908/839.jpg\" alt=\"Rousteing has re-created Balmain\u2019s aesthetic: under his leadership it is tight, leggy and bright.\" width=\"839\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rousteing has recreated Balmain\u2019s aesthetic: under his leadership it is tight, leggy and bright.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jason Lloyd-Evans/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Rousteing was closely involved in sealing the deal. \u201cI met them right at the start, and we clicked. They understand the depth in my work. They get that I have success because I work hard.\u201d To paraphrase <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2014/nov/27/why-working-girl-offers-the-real-deal-mike-nichols-melanie-griffith\">Melanie Griffiths in Working Girl</a>, Rousteing has a head for business and a bod for Instagram. \u201cThe point of my Instagram is to show the beauty of my life. I want to inspire people. Obviously, I\u2019m not going to post a picture of me where I don\u2019t feel like I am pretty, and I am not going to post a picture of my collection before it is ready. But everything is real. I can post a picture of a flower, of my grandma at Christmas.\u201d The bio on his Instagram reads, \u201cTHIS IS MY REALITY\u201d. To be fair, it is probably quite hard to take a bad photo of someone who looks like Rousteing.</p> <p>He works at this. \u201cI go to the gym every morning at 7.30. I work out, I box, and then I go to work for about 10am. I work late, so I eat in the office in the evening. And then I want to go to sleep, because I will be up early at the gym. I might go out Friday or Saturday, but not both.\u201d He was working late in his office on the Friday evening in November last year when news broke of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/nov/14/paris-attacks-timeline-of-terror\">terrorist attacks</a> that killed more than 130 people. Rousteing\u2019s apartment, like many of his colleagues\u2019, is in the 11th arrondissement, close to where the attacks took place, so they slept in the office. That weekend, he stayed in a hotel. \u201cI don\u2019t have anyone in my life in Paris,\u201d he told Vogue. \u201cMy assistants and colleagues went to their boyfriend\u2019s or girlfriend\u2019s or parents\u2019 \u2013 I don\u2019t have that here.\u201d</p> <p>Rousteing does have a support network, but it is a meta, international one. \u201cWhen I post on Instagram about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/justin-bieber\">Justin [Bieber]</a> or <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/lewis-hamilton\">Lewis [Hamilton]</a> or Kim or Rihanna, that\u2019s a real friendship I am showing. If I love your album, I\u2019ll post about your music. But also, we can call each other at 5am when we just need to talk.\u201d</p> <p>His connection to the Kardashians came through West, whom he first had lunch with seven years ago. These days, he is very close with Kris Jenner (\u201cI am always with Kris\u201d) and devoted to Kim. \u201cI don\u2019t care what anybody says about Kim. I love her. I love that she is a woman but has more power than so many men. And I love that she is so powerful but always takes care of the people she loves. And I admire her, because she is the best in the world at communicating with people.\u201d Like it or not, Kim makes people want what she has. It\u2019s a gift her friend Rousteing also has. Balmain\u2019s global presence is only going to grow as the house\u2019s new owners add their financial clout to the cultural pull of the Balmain army. \u201cFashion is a business. If you have a job in fashion, you have that job because people want fashion \u2013 and they want my fashion. You can dislike my taste, but you can\u2019t say I\u2019m not relevant.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Theresa May was accused of backing down on security concerns about Chinese involvement in nuclear power and failing to drive a better deal for taxpayers, following the announcement on Thursday on building the \u00a318bn <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/hinkley-point-c\">Hinkley Point C</a> plant.</p> <p>May\u2019s surprise decision to review the first planned nuclear power station for a generation when she arrived in Downing Street had been regarded as marking a break with George Osborne\u2019s enthusiastic courtship of China, and a greater willingness to take on big business. But after the Chinese ambassador publicly raised concerns about future trading relationships if Britain pulled the plug on the deal, May gave the go-ahead. </p> <p>On Thursday Vince Cable, the former Liberal Democrat business secretary, said that the prime minister had ducked an opportunity to revisit the economics of the Hinkley contract \u2013 which will entail the Treasury promising a guaranteed floor price for the electricity generated, paid for through householders\u2019 bills, over the reactor\u2019s lifetime. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2016/sep/15/business-nils-prately-on-finance-hinkley-point-c-deep-rethink-nuclear-power-uk-china-edf-cost-design\">Hinkley Point C: now for a deep rethink on the nuclear adventure?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cOver the last few weeks we have been marched up the hill and back here,\u201d Cable said. \u201cMaybe she just wanted to demonstrate that this had her fingerprints on it.The biggest issues around Hinkley are the price, and the technology, and those remain unchanged.

  "<p>We appreciate Hadley Freeman\u2019s point (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/10/hadley-freeman-fashion-skinny-models-eating-disorders-body-image\" title=\"\">Don\u2019t blame the fashion world for the cult of skinny, Weekend</a>, 10 September) that eating disorders are multifactorial, unattributed to any single cause. However, we disagree that the fashion industry, and its media representations, don\u2019t play a role.</p> <p>The industry\u2019s promotion of extreme thinness is a major sociocultural pressure that increases eating disorder risk. Furthermore, these pressures are harmful to models, who too often must put their health at risk to keep their job. Legislation that can change this thin-ideal saturated environment has a high potential to decrease the incidence of disordered eating behaviours.</p> <p>The Women\u2019s Equality party\u2019s proposal argues for legislation aiming to increase size and shape diversity in fashion, including through larger sample sizes. Such legislation can be effective when end-users are involved and when enforcement is possible in practice and through the allocation of resources. In&#xa0;addition, providing youth with tools to resist appearance pressures is critical to decreasing rates of disordered eating. The WEP\u2019s additional focus on including media literacy in curriculums would address this. A number of effective, evidence-based media literacy programmes are freely available for schools.</p> <p>Limiting the impact of the thin ideal can only happen through concerted efforts to decrease these pressures and simultaneously help young people resist them. The WEP\u2019s proposal outlines such&#xa0;a plan and may pave the way to healthier working conditions for models&#xa0;and positive body image for the&#xa0;greater public. <br><strong>Rachel Rodgers</strong> <em>Associate professor, Department of Applied Psychology, Northeastern University, USA, </em><strong>Professor S Bryn Austin </strong><em>Harvard TH Chan School of Public Health and Harvard Medical School, </em><strong>Sara Ziff</strong> <em>Founding director,</em> <em>Model Alliance,</em> <strong>\u00c1ine Campbell,</strong> <strong>Madeline Hill,</strong> <strong>Meredith Hattam</strong> <em>Co-directors, Model Alliance</em></p> <p><strong><em>\u2022 Join the debate \u2013 email </em></strong><a href=\"mailto:guardian.letters@theguardian.com\" title=\"\"><strong><em>guardian.letters@theguardian.com</em></strong></a></p>",

The new prime minister wants companies to publish the ratio between the chief executive\u2019s pay and the average company worker\u2019s pay, and it has emerged that the powerful Commons business committee will on Friday launch a wide-ranging inquiry into the make-up of company boards and executive pay.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/sep/15/select-committee-to-launch-inquiry-into-corporate-excess\">Select committee to launch inquiry into corporate excess</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Latest official figures show that regular earnings growth has slowed since the EU referendum and in a sign of continued insecurity in the workplace. Earlier this month new data also showed there has been a 20% rise in the number of people employed on zero-hour contracts, to 900,000, over the last year.</p> <p>Stefan Stern, director of the High Pay Centre said bonuses had their uses but must be handled with care and he highlighted the return to levels last seen when the financial crisis struck in 2008.</p> <p>\u201cOn the one hand, you could see why some employers would want to recognise people and reward them and say \u2018We are through the worst of it\u2019. But on the other hand, there\u2019s a worry that bad habits could return \u2026 I think small bonuses are perhaps a good idea but big bonuses are potentially very dangerous if they encourage people to take excessive risks.\u201d<br></p> <p>David Hillman, with the Robin Hood Tax campaign, said: \u201cOnce again these figures show that financial sector bonuses are way out of kilter with the rest of the economy. There is a long way to go before the excess of the City is curbed and this huge gulf in rewards between bankers and the public sector is addressed.\u201d</p> <p>The City\u2019s annual bonus round was a feature of the boom years in the early part of the 2000s, but the credit crunch, job losses and a clampdown on some of the riskier activities produced a sharp reduction in the payouts made by banks and other financial companies. The EU also introduced rules designed to limit City bonuses, although the rules actually resulted in many workers demanding higher basic pay. <br></p> <p>But bonus payments have gradually picked up again.</p> <p>The ONS data shows that finance and insurance remained the biggest contributor to the total. Employers in the sector handed out bonuses of \u00a313.9bn to their staff last year \u2013 an increase of 2.2% from a year earlier. But other sectors, such as IT and communication services \u2013 including marketing, advertising and PR \u2013 contributed more to growth as bonuses at non-financial companies rose 5.4% to \u00a330.4bn.<br></p> <p>The rewards on offer in the communications business were highlighted when WPP, the world\u2019s biggest advertising company, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jun/08/sir-martin-sorrell-pay-deal-faces-investor-revolt-at-wpp-agm\">paid its founder and boss Sir Martin Sorrell almost \u00a367m in bonuses</a> for last year. WPP suffered a shareholder rebellion, but approved the payout. At <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/apr/18/bp-bob-dudley-pay-package-shareholder\"> BP, a majority of shareholders opposed chief executive Bob Dudley\u2019s bonus-fuelled \u00a314m pay deal.</a> But the vote is only advisory and the rewards were still handed over.</p> <p>Nick Palmer, a statistician at the ONS, said: \u201cAlthough the finance and insurance industry retains the largest share of the total, other industries, particularly among professional and hi-tech business services, have been the biggest drivers of growth since 2008.\u201d<br></p> <p>Bonuses are spreading beyond the City, even as evidence mounts that the payouts are not good for companies in the long run. A Cornell Law School study found in 2014 that a company performs worse the more it pays its chief executive and that bonuses promote selfishness and opportunism. </p> <p>Neil Woodford, one of the UK\u2019s top fund managers, has recently <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/22/top-fund-manager-neil-woodford-investments-scraps-staff-bonuses\">scrapped bonuses for his employees</a>, arguing they are ineffective and can encourage bad behaviour.</p> <p>Finance and insurance workers received the highest average bonus at \u00a313,400 per employee. Health and social workers got virtually nothing. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/sep/2016-09-15T14:52:12/embed.html\" data-alt=\"Bonus graph\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/sep/2016-09-15T14:52:12/embed.html\">Bonus graph</a> </figure>  <p>Almost all the total for last year \u2013 \u00a343.7bn \u2013 was in the private sector with few bonuses in the public sector. Civil servants, teachers and hospitality workers were also near the bottom of the rankings.</p> <p>Though the cash value of bonuses was a record last year, the peak year for bonuses as a proportion of total pay was in 2008, when they accounted for 7.1% compared with 6% last year. </p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/economics-blog/2016/aug/22/city-bonus-culture-bad-for-customers-the-economy-for-workers-neil-woodford\">The City\u2019s bonus culture was widely blamed for fuelling the credit boom and financial crisis</a> by rewarding bosses and traders with cash for short-term results. In some cases, such as Fred Goodwin at Royal Bank of Scotland, chief executives became multimillionaires while leading their companies to the edge of collapse.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/2016/aug/09/theresa-may-should-stick-to-her-guns-on-executive-pay-and-low-pay-alike\">Theresa May should stick to her guns on executive pay and low pay alike</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In the finance industry, bonuses peaked as a share of total pay in 2008 at 34%. The equivalent figure was 22.7% last year, down from 23.1% the year before. In other sectors, bonuses were 4.5% of total pay last year \u2013 the highest level since the ONS started its calculations in 2000.</p> <p>Oliver Parry, Head of Corporate Governance at the Institute of Directors, said bonuses could be a useful incentive for staff, but warned caution was necessary with financial sector bonuses and that the scale of payouts should be linked closely to performance: \u201cFirms have to be very careful in areas like financial products that they don\u2019t create a culture which encourages staff to behave unethically, as we saw with PPI mis-selling. </p> <p>\u201cA separate question is the use of performance-related pay for senior executives, where there have been problems. A few thousand pounds for an employee who hits their targets is one thing, but multi-million bonuses and share awards for CEOs where company performance has not been outstanding, such as we saw at BP, anger shareholders and employees alike.\u201d </p> <p>The ONS said bonuses as a percentage of total pay were 6% for the whole economy, a small increase on the previous financial year. </p>",

  "<p>The government is to press ahead with increases of up to 500% in court fees for immigration and asylum cases, despite a consultation in which all but five of 147 responses opposed the move.</p> <p>The Ministry of Justice (MoJ) confirmed the decision on Thursday, saying it was grateful for the responses to the consultation, but the policy remained that, where fees were charged to access public services, they should be set at such a level to recover the full cost.</p> <p>The decision means that fees for an application to the first-tier tribunal dealing with immigration and asylum cases will increase from \u00a380 to \u00a3490 for \u201ca decision on the papers,\u201d and from \u00a3140 to \u00a3800 for an oral hearing. </p> <p>Fees are to be introduced for the first time for appeals to the upper tribunal: \u00a3350 for applications and \u00a3510 for the appeal hearing.</p> <p>The ministry\u2019s response to the consultation estimates that the charges will raise \u00a334m a year on top of the \u00a37m brought in annually by existing fees. This compares with estimated annual running costs of \u00a386m for both tribunals.</p> <p>Ministers have made one concession as a result of the consultation. Immigration and asylum applicants who have already been assessed as destitute by the Home Office will not have to pay the tribunal fees.

  "<p>Sylvia Gore, who has died aged 71, secured her place in football history when she scored the first official goal for England women, helping them to a 3-2 win over Scotland, their fierce rivals, on 18 November 1972.</p> <p>After years playing club football \u2013 at a time when the sport was still formally banned in England for women \u2013 Gore was named in the FA-sanctioned starting XI on that day as an attacking midfielder. She already had a strong reputation for technical skill and goal-scoring prowess, before the moment when, in torrential rain, she gathered the ball in her own half and ran the length of the pitch before sidefooting it into the net.</p> <p>That historic goal is a snapshot of a stellar playing career in which she was <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/37201105\" title=\"\">likened to her contemporary Denis Law</a> for both her playing style and her instinct for goals \u2013 she once scored 134 times in a season. She also had a long career as a coach and manager, including for Wales women, and as an ambassador for women\u2019s football. Almost every female player in the country has benefited from her endeavours, including the England internationals Rachel Brown and Sue Smith.</p> <p>Domestically, Gore was part of the Fodens team that shocked the dominant Southampton 2-1 to win the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FA_Women%27s_Cup\" title=\"\">1974 women\u2019s FA Cup</a>; she said some years later that the underdogs had not been frightened of their much-decorated opponents, and was adamant that they had deserved to take the trophy.</p> <p>She was born in Prescot (then in Lancashire, now in Merseyside), the daughter of Eileen (nee Nash) and John Gore. Sylvia\u2019s footballing education began early, watching her father and uncle play for their hometown club of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prescot_Cables_F.C.\" title=\"\">Prescot Cables</a> and then pulling on a pair of boots herself. She attended local schools, Our Lady\u2019s and St Edmund Arrowsmith, but with no girls\u2019 teams in Prescot, 12-year-old Sylvia joined Manchester Corinthians and spent her teenage years taking two buses to travel there for matches, accompanied by her parents.</p> <p>Because of the FA\u2019s ban on women\u2019s football, forbidding them to play on official grounds, she had to play on poor pitches with equally poor changing facilities. Gore gleefully recounted later in life that, instead of showers, she and her team-mates would have to use buckets of freezing cold water, or just jump into a nearby duck pond, to have a wash after a match.</p> <p>Though she played in an era when women\u2019s football was not professional, the game always came first for her. When, as a teenager, she was given the opportunity to take part in an overseas charity tour with Corinthians, she was happy to resign from her less than enthralling office job so that she could travel the world and play football on proper pitches in front of tens of thousands of fans as far afield as South America.</p> <p>She joined Fodens, originally a works team from the lorry manufacturing plant in Sandbach, Cheshire, in 1967, and played for them and England until she was forced into retirement aged 35 after sustaining a disabling back injury. She immediately concentrated her efforts on coaching and encouraging new generations of players \u2013 all as a volunteer. She managed the Wales women\u2019s national side between 1982 and 1989, and continued to coach across the north-west, serving as women\u2019s football development officer in Knowsley over three decades. She became the first female director of the Liverpool County FA, in 2014, and was also part of the Women\u2019s FA, which organised and ran women\u2019s football in England before the FA took over in 1993, after which she sat on its women\u2019s committee and then served as a delegate for the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FA_WSL\" title=\"\">Women\u2019s Super League</a>, launched in 2011.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cf1adfe8c837e0d4a16a22b993d0e985b0c52e66\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cf1adfe8c837e0d4a16a22b993d0e985b0c52e66/0_171_4096_2458/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sylvia Gore appointed club ambassador for Manchester City Women in March 2016.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sylvia Gore appointed club ambassador for Manchester City Women in March 2016.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Victoria Haydn/Manchester City FC</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Gore received a special achievement award at the inaugural FA Women\u2019s Football awards in 1999, and was made an MBE for her services to the game in 2000, the year in which she was also honoured by Uefa in Monte Carlo.

At the end of June, an unprecedented number of new members were <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/jun/29/oscars-motion-picture-academy-diversity\">invited to join</a>, 40% of them female or from minorities \u2013 and, sometimes, both.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/sep/03/moonlight-review-devastating-drama-is-vital-portrait-of-black-gay-masculinity-in-america\">Moonlight review \u2013 devastating drama is vital portrait of black gay masculinity in America</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Things were looking up.

Also, there was immediate hope on the horizon: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/jan/26/the-birth-of-a-nation-review-sundance-slavery-epic-as-brutal-as-braveheart\">The Birth of a Nation</a>, Nate Parker\u2019s acclaimed Confederacy biopic, which had premiered to wild applause at Sundance. An uncompromising take on racial politics, it was <a href=\"http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/sundance-birth-a-nation-sets-857365\">picked up</a> by Fox Searchlight for a record $17.5m (\u00a313.5m) on the presumption it would be the next <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/mar/03/oscars-2014-twelve-years-a-slave\">12 Years a Slave</a>.</p> <p>But lately, eggs have been removed from the Birth basket.

He is visibly thrilled \u2013 and relieved \u2013 to be receiving such acclaim for only his second film. \u201cI\u2019ve had a 65-year-old straight white man bawling in my arms.\u201d</p> <p>Loosely based on a play by <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarell_Alvin_McCraney\">Tarell Alvin McCraney</a>, the film focuses on Chiron, whose troubled life is split into three distinct sections, showing his struggle to define, disguise and ultimately accept his own sexuality in the deprived neighbourhoods of Miami. It is both acutely specific and easily relatable, touching upon issues of identity, coming of age, family and romantic attachment.</p> <p>Jenkins is fresh in town from the film\u2019s monumental launch at the Telluride film festival. But while the movie is yet to receive a negative review from critics, he is fending off a small but vociferous backlash online. \u201cI didn\u2019t tell anybody this,\u201d he says, \u201cbut I received hate on Twitter when the trailer dropped. Maybe it was naivety on my part, but it became a discussion that I didn\u2019t anticipate.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"a1f7f0bb1b6dd8b59aa3a25ba3c87212564755c5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a1f7f0bb1b6dd8b59aa3a25ba3c87212564755c5/0_115_2036_2544/800.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018Fifteen years ago, that kid loved ballet but the world has beaten it out of him\u2019 \u2026 Barry Jenkins.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Fifteen years ago, that kid loved ballet but the world has beaten it out of him\u2019 \u2026 Barry Jenkins.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Vivien Killilea/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The vociferous reaction in some quarters \u2013 also visible on <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9NJj12tJzqc\">YouTube</a> \u2013 claims the film poses a threat to black manhood. It is a sentiment that, oddly, echoes that of Parker, who claimed he would never play a gay character because of the need to \u201cpreserve black masculinity\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cGrowing up, you\u2019re told that being a black man, you have to be that much better than your counterparts,\u201d says <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trevante_Rhodes\">Trevante Rhodes</a>, an ex-athlete turned actor who makes a haunting impression as the twentysomething Chiron. </p> <p>\u201cYou have to be stronger, more masculine and the most dominant force in the room at all times. So that automatically puts up that block and you don\u2019t think it\u2019s possible to have any kind of vulnerability about you.\u201d</p> <p>Jenkins concurs: \u201cI think American society forces black men to fortify themselves to have to go out into the world and provide for themselves and survive. Again, the more you fortify, the deeper you\u2019re pushing that vulnerability. I think it\u2019s all connected.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s a theme that runs throughout the film as we see a boy, who likes dancing, turn into a teenager, who is afraid of liking anything, to a man, who gives off the impression that he likes being a criminal.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/oct/21/moonlight-film-tarell-alvin-mccraney-interview\">Moonlight's Tarell Alvin McCraney: 'I never had a coming out moment'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cWe all have masculine and feminine within us,\u201d says British actor <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/may/01/naomie-harris-interview-our-kind-of-traitor-bond-moneypenny\">Naomie Harris</a>, who delivers a ferocious turn as Chiron\u2019s neglectful, crack-addict mother. \u201cWe\u2019re just human beings and I think that\u2019s such a powerful message.

At the same time, I ended up going to a high school that was across town which was all-white and where vulnerability was actually very valuable. I say vulnerability, but what I really mean is being non-threatening. You have to straddle the fence.\u201d</p> <p>In the film, Chiron regulates his behaviour in order to prevent people from knowing he\u2019s gay, but the bullies at school and his cruel mother are aware of his sexuality and persecute him as a result. The experience of being a minority and self-censoring to fit into the world is one the cast find easy to relate to.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s a dexterity you have to have as a black person,\u201d says Mahershala Ali, who plays a local drug dealer who becomes a father figure to young Chiron. \u201cIf I\u2019m shopping somewhere nice or I go to a nice restaurant or I\u2019m working in a city where there are not a lot of black people, I\u2019m careful about how I walk and about how loud I talk or what I\u2019m wearing. You have to edit yourself in order to try and not draw attention. I\u2019ve been on the subway, dressed really nice, and seen women turn their ring over or cross the street and when you get that message over and over again that you\u2019re something to be feared, it\u2019s toxic.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a45822785bda0210278c8c0aa7224587ab528242\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a45822785bda0210278c8c0aa7224587ab528242/66_0_2880_1728/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Andrew Holland with Trevante Rhodes as the older Chiron.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Andre Holland with Trevante Rhodes as the older Chiron.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Bornfriend/A24</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Even today, they say, when they were doing press in a nearby building filled with residential apartments, they were told by an elderly white woman to vacate the elevator so she could take it.</p> <p>\u201cWe get lulled into thinking that there\u2019s equality and love,\u201d says Ali, \u201cand that discrimination isn\u2019t something that\u2019s still around and when that happens, it jars you and it\u2019s painful.\u201d</p> <p>The cast are conscious that the film is launching at a time of heightened violence by police against young black men in the US \u2013 and heightened consciousness of such prejudice. It\u2019s a situation that persists, they say, because of the same stereotypes they too constantly encounter. \u201cRecently, I was shooting a movie in Virginia and I was approached and stalked by officers because I had a hoodie on,\u201d Rhodes says. \u201cIt was the most surreal thing. It was unsettling to think that still exists.\u201d</p> <p>For Jenkins, this makes bringing a character such as Chiron to as wide an audience as possible yet more crucial. \u201cWe don\u2019t get to see stories about these people so we don\u2019t really get to humanise them and see how they get this way,\u201d he says. \u201cTo me it\u2019s groundbreaking that people are responding to a character like this. You walk past someone like him all the time. You see the grills and assume all these things. Fifteen years ago, that kid loved ballet but the world has beaten it out of him.\u201d</p> <p>And as for the Oscar buzz? Jenkins is trying to look at the bigger picture. \u201cI try and compartmentalise myself from the awards stuff,\u201d he says. \u201cWe did the best we could and that\u2019s what matters the most to me. It\u2019s really about making a statement that we are all human beings and we feel the same things.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e82768452528adccd28f1f8868ec255d40cf7993\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e82768452528adccd28f1f8868ec255d40cf7993/0_4_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ashton Sanders as the teenage Chiron.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ashton Sanders as the teenage Chiron.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Bornfriend/A24</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Yet such buzz translates into publicity, ticket sales \u2013 and, potentially, change. Moonlight manages to justify (for those who still require it) an increased call for diversity within two hours, as well as to provide a reflective experience for audience members who rarely get to see anything loosely resembling their lives on screen. Given the past year of violence against both people of colour and the LGBT community in the US, the importance of Moonlight\u2019s plea for tolerance is hard to understate.</p> <p>\u201cI feel like it\u2019s an idiotic thing to assume that loving a man is different to loving a woman,\u201d Rhodes says. \u201cYou\u2019re born a certain way and loving somebody is loving somebody. If you strip away gender and skin colour, we\u2019re all the same and, ultimately, love is the driving force.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022Moonlight premieres at the London film festival on 6 October and opens in the US on 21 October.</p>",
  "<p>Justin Tomlinson scurried into the Commons flanked by friendly Tory MPs and adjusted his expression to contrite.

And when his mate emailed four suggested amendments back, he had forwarded them virtually word for word on to the committee as if they were his own. As you do. It had just been a silly, silly little mistake. Hardly worth bothering with. Nothing to see here, move along. As Tomlinson just had. The poor man had been punished enough by being asked to give a statement and serve a two-day suspension. Saturday and Sunday should cover it.</p> <p>At times like these, it\u2019s noticeable how much more forgiving MPs sometimes are of each other\u2019s shortcomings than they are of anyone else\u2019s. One small misstep and a career can be in tatters. \u201cI\u2019d like to offer my personal thanks to Rona Fairhead, who has stepped down as chair of the BBC Trust,\u201d said the culture secretary, Karen Bradley, sounding anything but grateful in a later statement on the BBC. That\u2019s \u201cstepped down\u201d as in being given the choice to jump before being pushed.</p> <p>Three more times Bradley went out of her way to pay tribute to Fairhead \u2013 it was almost like a Pavlovian response whenever she had forgotten what else she was meant to be saying \u2013 without ever bothering to list a single of her achievements. Perhaps she couldn\u2019t think of any. Rona hadn\u2019t been brilliant at her job, but she hadn\u2019t been that bad either.</p> <p>Fairhead\u2019s real crime was that the prime minister had decided her face no longer fitted \u2013 too cozy with Dave \u2013 and what Theresa wants, Theresa gets. Out of sight, out of mind. Bradley was merely a high-paid functionary keeping her boss sweet. When the BBC is forced to reveal who earns more than \u00a3150K, it might care to point out that the not-very-talented culture secretary is on \u00a3141.5K. It will make some of the Beeb\u2019s stars look like a bargain.</p> <p>Still, at least there was an honesty to Bradley\u2019s artless dismissal of Fairhead. For the very highest levels of parliamentary self-forgiveness, we had to wait for the business and energy secretary, Greg Clark, to give his statement on the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/sep/15/hinkley-point-c-nuclear-power-station-gets-go-ahead\">Hinkley Point C nuclear power station</a>. Having originally delayed the decision to proceed back in July in order to double-check both the security implications and the cost, Clark was happy to pronounce that, thanks to his and the chancellor\u2019s incisive eye for detail \u2013 Philip Hammond was by his side to nod vigorously at this \u2013 the country now had the best deal ever.</p> <p>The fact that he had neither negotiated a drop in the price nor any extra security safeguards, as the ones in place were already sufficient, was irrelevant. He and the government had just done Britain a massive favour. By looking the French and the Chinese in the eye and blinking.</p> <p>\u201cThe British people will not have to pay a penny until and unless the power station is built,\u201d he declared. The \u201cunless\u201d was a curious choice of word for a minister claiming to have safeguarded Britain\u2019s electricity supply for the next 60 years. \u201cAnd the fact that consumers will pay up to \u00a330bn over the odds if the power station is built is only fair because the project is bound to overrun and it wouldn\u2019t be right to expect the French and the Chinese to take the hit.\u201d</p> <p>Several MPs pointed out that the FT, the Economist and the National Audit Office had all described the deal as dreadful for consumers. Clark merely smiled. The people would come to see what a great deal it was in 2025. And if they didn\u2019t, so much time would have passed no one would remember he was the one to blame. Least of all him. In fact, he\u2019d forgiven himself and forgotten already.</p>",

Increasing numbers of men were representing themselves and re-traumatising their victims when they made repeated and often spurious applications for access, they said.</p> <p>Peter Kyle, the Labour MP for Hove, said: \u201cThe family courts are being used to perpetrate abuse against extremely vulnerable women \u2026 One of my constituents has been cross-examined by her former partner on three separate occasions, the man who beat her, broke her bones and battered her unconscious.\u201d</p> <p>He said a transformation of family courts was \u201cdesperately needed\u201d to end the \u201cabuse and brutalisation of women\u201d via the legal system.</p> <p>Angela Smith, the Labour MP for Penistone and Stocksbridge, raised the case of her constituent Claire Throssell and her children, Jack, 12, and Paul, nine, as Throssell watched from the public gallery. </p> <p>Throssell\u2019s estranged partner, Darren Sykes, a perpetrator of domestic violence who had threatened her and his children, <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2016/jun/22/murdered-boys-mother-speaks-out-after-ellie-butler-case\">murdered both boys during a contact visit</a> to his home in 2014 by enticing them to the loft with a new train set.

Sykes died in the fire.</p> <p>Smith said the family courts needed to properly implement \u201cpractice guidance 12 J\u201d, which is supposed to force judges to put the safety of children and their residential parent before the access rights of a violent and abusive parent.</p> <p>She highlighted the demands in the Women\u2019s Aid report for an end to the cross-examination of a survivor by an abuser in family courts, and for special protection to be brought in, such as separate waiting areas, to keep victims safe from violent partners in court buildings.</p> <p>Smith said there was a need both to end the assumption that men who were abusive to women could be good fathers, and to embed a culture in the family courts of putting children first.</p> <p>\u201cThese changes are critical if we are to make sure this never happens again,\u201d Smith said in reference to the Throssell case. \u201cFor Claire\u2019s sake and for the sake of vulnerable women, we need the government to send out a clear message by agreeing to act. Jack and Paul must not be forgotten.\u201d</p> <p>MPs also urged the government to respond to the all-party parliamentary group\u2019s report on domestic abuse, child contact and the family courts, which said the courts needed to ensure there was safe child contact, not contact at any cost.</p> <p>Gill Furniss, the Labour MP for Sheffield, Brightside and Hillsborough, said: \u201cI urge the minister to instigate a full review based on the Women\u2019s Aid report and the APPG findings \u2026 because we must ensure that Jack and Paul and all other victims are never forgotten.\u201d </p> <p>Keir Starmer, the former director of public prosecutions and Labour MP for Holborn and St Pancras, said it was important to look at the changes made to the criminal justice system to better protect victims of domestic violence \u2013 including special measures for victims and witnesses, and the presence of independent abuse advocates \u2013 and ask why the family courts were not making similar changes. <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>He said there was growing evidence that perpetrators of domestic abuse were using the family courts to continue to harass and control their victims. </p> <p>Phillip Lee, the parliamentary undersecretary of state for victims, youth and family justice, said the government was not complacent. \u201cI think it is fair to say the family court system can learn valuable lessons from the criminal justice system.\u201d <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>He said the government was studying the research by the APPG on domestic violence extremely carefully.</p>",

John Bercow, the Speaker, replied: \u201cThat\u2019s the end of it.\u201d <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>The committee\u2019s investigation found that in May 2013, when Tomlinson was a member of the Commons public accounts committee (PAC), he used a personal email address to email a Wonga employee a draft report of a then-ongoing inquiry into the consumer credit market.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>The Wonga employee, who had given evidence to the PAC inquiry, responded with comments from him and a colleague about the report, describing them as \u201careas we thought the committee might want to focus on\u201d.</p> <p>An exchange of emails followed about suggested changes to the report, after which Tomlinson got in contact with a PAC staff member, setting out the amendments, but not divulging their origin.</p> <p>The investigation said Tomlinson, the MP for North Swindon, had immediately accepted he had made an error, and had apologised to the PAC.</p> <p>Tomlinson had initially been supportive of a private member\u2019s bill put forward by the Labour MP Stella Creasy to curb the activities of payday lenders, but eventually voted with the government. <br></p> <p>Creasy, the MP for Walthamstow who sat on the PAC with Tomlinson, said: \u201cI am disappointed to hear about this incident and cannot understand why Justin, if he was interested in strengthening legislation and helping those suffering at the hands of payday lenders, decided to send this document to Wonga instead of the Citizens Advice or other charities which work with those who have struggled to repay their debts.\u201d </p> <p>The affair was further complicated by the fact that two years before the email exchange, Tomlinson had helped arrange for Wonga to provide \u00a330,000 of sponsorship to his local football club, Swindon Supermarine.<br></p> <p>After the emails, in 2014 and 2015, the chairman of the club, Jez Webb, made six donations to his constituency party, which totalled about the same sum.</p> <p>The inquiry report by Kathryn Hudson, the parliamentary commissioner for standards, said Webb had not been chairman of the club when the Wonga deal was negotiated, and there was no evidence the money was connected. Tomlinson had told the inquiry that the similarity between the sponsorship and donation amounts was a \u201chorrible, horrible, coincidence\u201d.</p> <p> The report was, however, highly critical of the MP\u2019s actions. The <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201617/cmselect/cmprivi/672/67203.htm#_idTextAnchor008\">report\u2019s conclusion</a> said they amounted to \u201ca substantial interference\u201d in the work of the PAC.</p> <p>Tomlinson told the inquiry he had not been given any formal training on the work of Commons committees, although he conceded he should have known sharing the draft report was a mistake, especially as it was protected by a password and had a \u201crestricted access\u201d marking.</p> <p>The MP said he had used a private email as parliamentary staff had access to this inbox and \u201ccould be the ones to forward it to the newspapers or to other people\u201d.<br></p> <p>Hudson did say she found it \u201cdifficult to understand\u201d why Tomlinson said he did not think the suggested changes to the report were Wonga\u2019s view, as the Wonga employee made it clear he had consulted someone else and was putting forward the views of the company. </p> <p>In mitigation, the committee found Tomlinson did not seek to have Wonga\u2019s views explicitly shape the report. The MP has described his actions as the \u201cresult of my own naivety and stupidity\u201d over the confidentiality of committee papers. The report added: \u201cWe are concerned that a member of a select committee was able to be in such a position.\u201d<br></p> <p>The privileges committee only has the power to recommend a suspension from parliament.

  "<p>Environmental destruction and landgrabs could lead to governments and individuals being prosecuted for crimes against humanity by the international criminal court following a decision to expand its remit.<br></p> <p>The UN-backed court, which sits in The Hague, has mostly ruled on cases of genocide and war crimes since it was set up in 2002. It has been criticised for its reluctance to investigate major environmental and cultural crimes, which often happen in peacetime.<br></p> <p> In <a href=\"https://www.icc-cpi.int/Pages/item.aspx?name=pr1238\">a change of focus</a>, the ICC said on Thursday it would also prioritise crimes that result in the \u201cdestruction of the environment\u201d, \u201cexploitation of natural resources\u201d and the \u201cillegal dispossession\u201d of land. It also included an explicit reference to land-grabbing.</p> <p>The court, which is funded by governments and is regarded as the court of last resort, said it would now take many crimes that have been traditionally under-prosecuted into consideration.</p> <p>The ICC is not formally extending its jurisdiction, but the court said it would assess existing offences, such as crimes against humanity, in a broader context. <br></p> <p>The ICC\u2019s policy paper on case selection and prioritisation declares: \u201cThe office [of the prosecutor] will give particular consideration to prosecuting Rome statute crimes that are committed by means of, or that result in, inter alia, the destruction of the environment, the illegal exploitation of natural resources or the illegal dispossession of land.\u201d </p> <p>Land-grabbing has become increasingly common worldwide, with national and local governments allocating private companies tens of millions of hectares of land in the past 10 years.</p> <p>The anti-corruption campaigners Global Witness say this has led to many forced evictions, the cultural genocide of indigenous peoples, malnutrition and environmental destruction.</p> <p>Alice Harrison, an adviser at Global Witness, said: \u201cToday\u2019s announcement should send a warning shot to company executives and investors that the environment is no longer their playground. </p> <p>\u201cThe terrible impacts of land-grabbing and environmental destruction have been acknowledged at the highest level of criminal justice, and private sector actors could now be put on trial for their role in illegally seizing land, flattening rainforests or poisoning water sources.\u201d</p> <p>International lawyers said broadening the priority cases to include land-grabbing would recognise that mass human rights violations committed during peacetime and in the name of profit could be just as serious as traditional war crimes. </p> <p>\u201cIt will not make land-grabbing <em>per se</em> a crime, but mass forcible evictions that results from land-grabbing may end up being tried as a crime against humanity,\u201d said Richard Rogers, a partner in the international criminal law firm Global Diligence. </p> <p>Rogers has lodged a case with the ICC on behalf of 10 Cambodians alleging that the country\u2019s ruling elite, including its government and military, has perpetuated mass rights violations since 2002 in pursuit of wealth and power by grabbing land and forcibly evicting up to 350,000 people.<br></p> <p>\u201cCambodia is a perfect example for this new ICC focus. It fits in to the new criteria,\u201d he said.</p> <p>He predicted it could have a bearing on the way business is done in certain countries. \u201cCompanies who want to invest in [some] places risk being complicit in crimes against humanity. Tackling land-grabbing will also help address some of the causes of climate change, since deforestation is very often a result of land-grabbing.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2016/may/03/paraguay-battles-over-land-rights-in-the-courts-and-across-the-airwaves\">Paraguay battles over land rights in the courts and across the airwaves</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The new ICC focus could also open the door to prosecutions over climate change, Rogers said, because a large percentage of CO2 emissions had been caused by deforestation as a result of illegal land-grabbing.<br></p> <p>The ICC can take action if the crime happens in any of the 124 countries that have ratified the Rome statute, if the perpetrator originates from one of these countries, or if the UN security council refers a case to it. Crimes must have taken place after the Rome statue came into force on 1 July 2002.</p> <p>Reinhold Gallmetzer, a member of the ICC working group who drew up the policy document, said: \u201cWe are exercising our jurisdiction by looking at the broader context in which crimes are committed. We are extending the focus to include Rome statute crimes already in our jurisdiction.</p> <p>\u201cForcible transfer [of people] can already be a crime against humanity, so if it is committed by land-grabbing \u2013 whether as a result or a precursor \u2013 it can be included.\u201d</p> <p>The ICC paper also lists other crimes, such as arms trafficking, human trafficking, terrorism and financial crimes, in which it intends to provide more help to individual states to carry out national prosecutions. </p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 19 September 2016.

They gathered at the edge of the cordon as the plain, black van pulled up to the entrance to the block. </p> <p>Before officials could begin their work, Anny Basala Ekofo\u2019s sister and Botanba rushed through the cordon to try to get closer to their loved ones, only to be intercepted by police.</p> <p>\u201cBasala, Basala, wake up,\u201d cried her sister. More family members came forward to comfort them as officers formed a line to prevent the mourners from advancing any further. </p> <p>The crowd stayed to watch as the bodies were taken from the block.

  "<p>January 1976 was as bitter as any winter in Nashville and, as the young New York film-maker Jim Szalapski made his way back north, his camera caught the land\u2019s starkness: snow flurries, icy roads, trailers upturned and cargo spilled. Szalapski had just finished shooting a documentary he would name Heartworn Highways, a profile of a new country scene emerging out of Texas and Tennessee; singer-songwriters such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/may/17/guy-clark-song-tribute-country-music\">Guy Clark</a>, Townes Van Zandt, and the young Steve Earle and Rodney Crowell who would become known as proponents of \u201coutlaw country\u201d. Working with a small crew, and even smaller budget, over the course of a few weeks he had caught these musicians playing across liquor-soaked evenings in trailer lots, blacksmiths\u2019 workshops and penitentiaries, attempting to place their music in a cultural landscape.</p> <p>Ten months later, over Thanksgiving weekend, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/martinscorsese\">Martin Scorsese</a> began shooting <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/dec/04/the-last-waltz-review\">The Last Waltz</a>, a recording of Canadian-American group the Band\u2019s farewell concert in San Francisco. It featured not only songs by the Band, but also a glut of their musical friends: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/bobdylan\">Bob Dylan</a>, Muddy Waters, Neil Young, Van Morrison, and the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/feb/12/mavis-staples-i-often-think-what-would-have-happened-if-id-married-bob-dylan\">Staple Singers</a> among them.

Heartworn Highways did not surface until 1981, when it played for a week at the Art Cinema on Eighth Street in New York. And though it has garnered a cult following (and a low-key DVD release) in the years since, it has stood somewhat in the shadows. When he died in 2000, Szalapski believed his great labour of love had been a failure. It is interesting to see 1976 as framed by these two films. That year\u2019s US album charts were dominated by [Peter Frampton\u2019s] Frampton Comes Alive, Wings at the Speed of Sound, Their Greatest Hits (1971-1975) by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/eagles\">Eagles</a> and Stevie Wonder\u2019s Songs in the Key of Life. Heartworn Highways and The Last Waltz offer something quite different, and helped to spawn the musical genre we have come to know as Americana.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>When I grew up, country music represented a frame of mind that I didn\u2019t care for \u2013 it was redneck music</p> <footer> <cite>Philip Schopper</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>At the time Szalapski began shooting, country music was in the midst of an upheaval. Four years earlier had seen the opening of Opryland, an extravagant theme park that offered rollercoasters and log flumes, and provided a new home for the Grand Ole Opry \u2013 the phenomenally popular country music radio show recorded before a studio audience, whose organisers considered themselves the fierce conservators of the country sound.</p> <p>But country had begun to change: in the early 60s, a folk scene had sprung up in the south, promoting not only contemporary and traditional folk artists but blues greats such as Lightnin\u2019 Hopkins and Mance Lipscomb. By the time Bob Dylan arrived in Nashville to record Blonde on Blonde in early 1966, the first of three albums he recorded in the city, it felt as if the formulaic Nashville country sound was giving way to something more reflective of a traditional heritage, and of the decade\u2019s countercultural movement. In the years that followed, the next generation of country stars drew on these folk and rock influences, as well as honky tonk and rockabilly, and the resulting \u201coutlaw country\u201d movement, led by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2002/feb/15/guardianobituaries1\">Waylon Jennings</a>, Willie Nelson and Kris Kristofferson found a ready audience; in 1976 the compilation Wanted!

In my mind it was associated with prejudice and intolerance and that sort of thing.\u201d Still, he had made a pact with Szalapski some years earlier that if either of them managed to get a film off the ground the other would work on it.</p> <p>And Szalapski was persuasive. He told Schopper that, \u201cthese fellas were writing their own material, and it was a new kind of country music, and they were outlaw musicians in the sense that they were outside the mainstream of country music production at that time\u201d. Szalapski, he recalls, had already made a couple of field trips down to Texas and Tennessee. \u201cHe went down with a tape recorder first of all, sat in their homes, their living rooms recording some of the music as they play. The musicians would tend to get together of an evening, playing \u2013 pickin\u2019 and grinnin\u2019 as they call it.\u201d He returned to New York enamoured with it, says Schopper: \u201cHe would play it for people and say: \u2018Listen to this! Something should be done with this!\u2019 And he would try to pitch a film.\u201d</p> <p>Though he was unsure of the commercial value of such a film, Schopper was soon smitten, too. \u201cWhat these folks were playing was different. I was drawn to it. I would hear the writing and the skill of musicianship and was really knocked out by it, and the values it was embracing were much closer to hippy values. These songs were about real people and real experiences, and weren\u2019t simply songs about driving your truck, getting drunk and cheating on your girlfriend.\u201d</p> <p>Szalapski also proved very convincing to a young British art dealer named Graham Leader. The pair had grown friendly over a couple of years, and when Leader found himself with time on his hands he decided to head to Nashville with his director friend to hear the music Szalapski had raved about.</p> <p> \u201cI just went there on an adventure,\u201d he recalls. \u201cThe thing that really captured my imagination was entering this world, a world I would never have stepped into. And being there, in a way, was a revelation and I thought: \u2018Who wouldn\u2019t be interested in this music, this world and these people?\u2019 So I asked Jim what it would take to make the film and he gave me a number and I said: \u2018OK, let\u2019s just do it.\u2019\u201d Leader signed on as producer, and five weeks later they were filming.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjnXkhwubzQ\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/FjnXkhwubzQ?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>Trailer for Heartworn Highways.</figcaption> </figure>   <p>There has been nothing throughout Leader\u2019s career that has given him quite the same satisfaction as Heartworn Highways. \u201cBecause of its purity,\u201d he explains, \u201cand the way it was made. Jim was the proverbial fly on the wall, able to get in very close to the subject, whatever the subject. I don\u2019t think the music world is a world that\u2019s wide open, and it\u2019s certainly a distrusting world, but because of his nature and his ability to be sublimated to whatever was going on, he was able to move in very close, and through that find the real depth of colours, of tones, of pictures that you would never ever see, normally.\u201d</p> <p>Upon the film\u2019s brief release in 1981, the <a href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/postscript-guy-clark-1941-2016\">New Yorker</a> ran a three-page review of Heartworn Highways, and while it praised the film highly bemoaning the lack of structure or narration. In truthThat perceived messiness was wholly intentional. \u201cJim and I used to joke that we were making a content-free documentary,\u201d Schopper laughs. \u201cMeaning we had no agenda, we weren\u2019t out to do a documentary about the music industry or the music business, we were making a film that felt like an experience; you step into it and when you step out of it you feel like you\u2019ve been somewhere and been immersed in something.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt was non-narrated, and in those days to have a film that was non-narrated and cuts away from the action to action that was going on elsewhere\u2026 [didn\u2019t happen],\u201d Leader explains. \u201cWe wanted the whole film to be like a song,\u201d Schopper adds. \u201cEverything had to do with feeling. What feels right to be next, until finally we have something all together that took you along on an emotional and musical trip, and you can come away feeling like you\u2019ve met some people. And not to be overly corny about it, but maybe you\u2019ve met some friends.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>At the opening chords of I\u2019m a Man, Marty just went into complete panic - he had told everyone to turn off their camera</p> <footer> <cite>Jonathan Taplin</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>What The Last Waltz had that Heartworn Highways did not was money, famous subjects and a pre-ordained narrative structure. \u201cIt came together incredibly quickly,\u201d recalls the film\u2019s producer, Jonathan Taplin. \u201cWe just all ran up to San Francisco, brought the best cameramen we knew and literally arrived the night before. In one night, we got 90% of the film. But like any documentary it begins to have an interesting flow to it, and you begin to tell a story, and that was the story both of the Band but also of the music.\u201d</p> <p>There were hair-raising moments; shooting on 35mm film meant that the magazines had to be changed every 10 minutes, leading to some performances being sacrificed. When Muddy Waters turned up too late to rehearse and announced he would be playing Mannish Boy and Caledonia, Scorsese decided they would change magazines during the first song. \u201cMarty didn\u2019t understand that Mannish Boy was Muddy\u2019s term for I\u2019m a Man,\u201d recalls Taplin. \u201cAnd at those opening chords of I\u2019m a Man, Marty just went into complete panic, he realised that was the most important song for Muddy and he had told everyone to turn off their cameras.\u201d Only by fluke \u2013 one of the cameramen had removed his headphones and therefore had not heard Scorsese\u2019s instruction to stop filming and change the magazine \u2013 did the the song get filmed.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=91Eg95vF72k\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/91Eg95vF72k?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>The Band perform Further on up the Road with Eric Clapton in The Last Waltz.</figcaption> </figure>   <p>For the most part, Taplin remembers the joy of that night \u2013 the way \u201cthose friends of theirs really raised their performances to the best level possible,\u201d he says. \u201cTo me it\u2019s one of the best Van Morrison performances ever. Neil Young was astonishing. I think everybody who was there felt the strength of the moment. There\u2019s a sequence where <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/ericclapton\">Eric Clapton</a>\u2019s doing Further on up the Road, and Robbie Robertson takes the second solo, and they were both pushing each other to play at a level that I hadn\u2019t seen either of them play for a while. And there\u2019s a kind of grin going back and forth.\u201d His personal highlight, however, is Levon Helm singing The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down. \u201cFor me that\u2019s the kind of elegiac tune that the Band represents, and the film represents. It\u2019s about the end of a time, and obviously the song is about the end of another time, but it has a sad but beautiful we\u2019re gonna somehow still survive mood to it that\u2019s pretty unique.\u201d</p> <p>The legacy of these two 40-year-old films is tangible. Leader says: \u201cI can be anywhere in the world, at a party or a dinner, and people tell me how much they love that film. I was once in an elevator in Sydney wearing a Heartworn Highways T-shirt, and a young band got in and one of the guys looked at me and said: \u2018That\u2019s my favourite film.\u2019It was very special, because it had been in the dark for so long.\u201d Among its many fans are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/jan/31/father-john-misty-josh-tillman-fleet-foxes\">Father John Misty</a>, and Colin Greenwood of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/radiohead\">Radiohead</a>. An anniversary edition of Heartworn Highways released this year was also accompanied by a sequel, Heartworn Revisited, which focused on contemporary musicians ploughing a similar furrow \u2013 among them Justin Townes Earle, Langhorne Slim and Jonny Fritz, with contributions from the players of the original film. Leader now plans to turn Highways into a series.</p> <p>For Taplin, The Last Waltz \u201cdid something to preserve a sense of this roots music\u201d \u2013 music with \u201crough edges\u201d made without aid ofAuto-Tune or Pro-Tools\u201d. He speaks of the young artists, including Mumford &amp; Sons and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/aug/31/sturgill-simpson-country-music-reluctant-saviour-metamodern-sounds-interview\">Sturgill Simpson</a>, who have cite its influence. \u201cI think that next generation of kids that began to make this Americana thing real, that was a touchstone for them. It was a way for them to go back and to think about more simple, grounded music in a time when that wasn\u2019t what was really going on.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7092b1ed9a1c2cb0cce9edbd8fb651026e9f88de\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7092b1ed9a1c2cb0cce9edbd8fb651026e9f88de/0_40_3386_2031/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Heartworn Highways Rodney Crowell\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rodney Crowell, as seen in Heartworn Highways.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: film company handout</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>One of those artists is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2011/sep/23/life-after-death-simone-felice\">Simone Felice</a>, once of the Felice Brothers, and now a solo performer and producer. \u201cI was born and grew up in the shadow of Big Pink,\u201d he says, meaning the house in West Saugerties in upstate New York where the Band holed up in the late 60s. \u201cWe used to ride our bicycles past it as kids \u2026 Teleport to 2006. By the greasy hand of fate my brothers and I found ourselves living in an extremely creepy mansion on the Hudson River, writing songs and shooting deer rifles. There was an old TV with a VHS player. We found a tape of The Last Waltz and put it in \u2026 Two words: Holy Shit.\u201d</p> <p>He would later play with Helm, and hear about the darker side of life with the Band, but still he likes to keep the memory of what The Last Waltz inspired safe. \u201cThose nights by the river, watching and learning with my brothers and friends,\u201d he says, \u201cwhen the music business was still a glittering Oz where songs and dreams collided and not the festering toilet I\u2019ve come to know \u2013 the unfettered spirit of music flowed from those men and women on the TV as from some wild, legendary river in a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/johnsteinbeck\">Steinbeck</a> novel. That\u2019s what I\u2019ll choose to take away. That\u2019s what I\u2019ll choose to carry.\u201d</p> <p>The legend that The Last Waltz helped to instill, remains part of the Band and their contemporaries\u2019 appeal. \u201cThe Band are the ultimate exponents of the melting pot that is Americana,\u201d says Barney Hoskyns, author of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/mar/02/small-town-talk-bob-dylan-the-band-van-morrison-joplin-hendrix-woodstock-barney-hoskyns-review\">Small Town Talk: Bob Dylan, The Band, Van Morrison, Janis Joplin, Jimi Hendrix and Friends in the Wild Years of Woodstock</a>. \u201cThey\u2019re the band cited by all the innumerable acts that mine that seam. You could probably say 5,000 bands since who have wanted to be the Band, though they\u2019re not as talented or as steeped in music and they\u2019re middle-class pretenders. But that\u2019s the fantasy to life in Big Pink.</p> <p>\u201cDid they create Americana at Big Pink?\u201d he asks. \u201cProbably. That is music taken from every element of American roots. It\u2019s neither black nor white. It\u2019s rural but not entirely rural. It\u2019s southern but not entirely. It\u2019s soulful, it\u2019s bluesy, it\u2019s folksy. It\u2019s got gospel in there, but rock\u2019n\u2019roll elements there, too. What would you have called it then? So it began a strain of retromania, of pulling away from the contemporary moment and retreating into some sort of cocoon of authenticity. Which, of course, isn\u2019t authentic at all.\u201d</p> <p>Forty years on \u2013 whether through a shared retromania or a celebration of songwriting prowess and the countercultural voice \u2013 these two films do seem to speak to one another. They portray a time in 1976 when a group of musicians were helping to define one of the US\u2019s distinct musical voices. \u201cThose roots of Americana go deep,\u201d says Hoskyns, \u201cand if we look at the musical tree, then I\u2019d say The Last Waltz and Heartworn Highways are branches of the same tree.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 <em>The soundtrack to Heartworn Highways is out now on Light in the Attic</em></p>",

He\u2019s played by Woody Harrelson, an odd choice for anyone who\u2019s ever seen a picture of Johnson, but with heavy prosthetics, distracting at first and also strangely useless given that he ends up looking more like Nixon. </p> <p>The film focuses on Johnson\u2019s rivalry with John F Kennedy as the pair go up against each other as the democratic candidate and once Johnson loses, we see him deal with life as an over-experienced vice-president and, after tragedy strikes, president. Overwhelmed with responsibility and disrespected by Kennedy\u2019s aides, he finds himself stuck in a difficult situation.</p> <p>From the first notes of worthy presidential music, it\u2019s clear that LBJ is not going to worry itself with reinventing the political biopic. Reiner\u2019s take on the Kennedy years of Johnson\u2019s life is strictly conventional, even down to the oft-used marching drums in the background, but it\u2019s solidly entertaining nonetheless, its adherence to formula never dulling its drama.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dg3k23ixGqQ\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/dg3k23ixGqQ?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>The dialogue might often resort to painfully clunky exposition but it never resorts to a simplistic portrayal of Johnson and his politics. As an older southern democrat, he\u2019s torn between his heritage and Kennedy\u2019s progressive views and, in particular, his strong belief in the importance of civil rights. He\u2019s painted as a man playing both sides but also learning, his pragmatism and values ultimately ushering him towards equality. It\u2019s refreshing in a rigid, and often cliched, film as this to see such a flawed protagonist.</p> <p>There\u2019s also a pleasing focus on political minutiae, detailed enough but accessibly conveyed and the film weaves in the growing issue of aesthetics (Johnson is deeply aware of his position as workhorse compared to JFK\u2019s showhorse) at a time when media representation was starting to have a profound effect on voters. There\u2019s also a nicely played scene where Johnson discusses the importance of civil rights with a bigioted southern senator (a believably foul Richard Jenkins) as his black maid serves them dinner.</p> <p>Harrelson overcomes the heavy layer of prosthetics to deliver a commanding and layered take on the president. He easily flips from confidence (bragging about the size of his penis to a busy room) to embarrassment (a Dallas crowd eager for JFK has no interest in him) and it\u2019s a pleasure to see him play something other than wisecracking support. Yet Jennifer Jason Leigh has precious little to do in the thankless role of his wife and, at a tight 98 minutes, the film feels somewhat short on their relationship.</p> <p>It\u2019s a well-worn road but Reiner steers with skill, delivering his best film since 1995\u2019s The American President, hinting that he might have more political tales in him yet.

He also said, however, that any post-Brexit deal should preclude agreements to privatise public services and should not feature current rules on a ban on state aid for industries that not all EU members abided by.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m just making the point that in our relationship with the European market, whatever form it is \u2026 we need to make sure we are not signing up to something that actually constrains governments in the future,\u201d he said. </p> <p>Corbyn also reiterated some of the ideas floated during his battle against Owen Smith for the Labour leadership. He called for a programme of national investment in infrastructure and training, and an emphasis on scientific research and nation-wide high-speed broadband.</p> <p>He also said the changing global economic situation presented \u201ca deep challenge to the social democratic and socialist tradition of which Labour, new or old, has always been a part\u201d. He added: \u201cIt punctures the old belief that it was possible simply to redistribute the proceeds [of] a growing economy to pay for public services. It can no longer credibly be argued, for the majority of people, that free trade and free markets alone will deliver increased prosperity. A future Labour government will have to do more than redistribute income and wealth. It will have to focus on how we earn that income and wealth in the first place.\u201d</p> <p>Other ideas floated in the speech included giving each new recipient of a national insurance number details on how to join a trade union, and a \u201cPhilip Green law\u201d to curb dividends and set rules on adding debt to companies.</p> <p>This was \u201can alternative to the drift and decay of the Tories\u201d, Corbyn said, adding: \u201cWe can and we will rebuild and transform this economy so that no one and no community is left behind.\u201d</p> <p>Corbyn is seen as increasingly likely to defeat Smith in the leadership contest. The result is due to be announced on 24 September just before the start of Labour\u2019s annual conference. </p> <p>On Thursday the bookmaker William Hill said it had received a \u00a360,000 bet on Corbyn to win at odds of 1/16, and had now trimmed the odds to 1/25.</p>",
  "<p>There are very few victims of Russian hackers who emerge with their reputations enhanced. Colin Powell may be unique for that alone, judging from the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2016/sep/14/hacked-colin-powell-emails-jolt-presidential-race\">bluntness of his leaked emails</a> about Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton.</p> <p>To be clear: hacking personal emails is reprehensible, and those behind the hack are scumbags who are trying to manipulate American voters.</p> <p>To be doubly clear: the news media (including this column) have no principles and no shame in exploiting the ill-gotten product of those scumbags. Guilty, as charged.<br></p> <p>And yet the Powell emails are so insightful and direct, it seems a shame \u2013 even if we have no sense of shame to let them pass by without comment.<br></p> <p>First, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/14/colin-powell-emails-trump-disgrace-but-no-clinton-vote\">the emails</a> are as scathing as they are fresh from his outbox. One, dating from June, describes Donald Trump as \u201ca national disgrace\u201d and \u201can international pariah\u201d. Powell said Democrats had no need to attack Trump because he was \u201cin the process of destroying himself\u201d.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Another, from just last month, describes Trump\u2019s pursuit of Barack Obama\u2019s birth certificate as racist. \u201cYup, the whole birther movement was racist,\u201d Powell said. \u201cThat\u2019s what the 99% believe. When Trump couldn\u2019t keep that up he said he also wanted to see if the certificate noted that he was a Muslim\u2026 As I have said before, \u2018What if he was?\u2019 Muslims are born as Americans everyday.\u201d<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>You might say he considered Trump and his supporters deplorable.</p> <p>As Buzzfeed <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeed.com/andrewkaczynski/colin-powell-calls-trump-national-disgrace-in-personal-email?utm_term=.pjyzxWePJ#.esPQg45BK\">reports</a>, the emails were obtained by <a href=\"http://dcleaks.com/\">DCLeaks.com</a>, a site with reported links to Russian intelligence. If such reports are true, the Russians may have finally misread the impact of their leaks. Far from making Powell look foolish, the emails only savage the candidate who so admires Vladimir Putin.</p> <p>Powell was astonished, for instance, that Trump would hire Roger Ailes, the disgraced former head of Fox News, who now sits in a cesspool of sexual harassment claims. \u201cAiles as an advisor won\u2019t heal women, don\u2019t you think,\u201d wrote Powell.</p> <p>Powell was already a national treasure. Not just as a former general, national security adviser, chairman of the joint chiefs and secretary of state. But as the best qualified and most charismatic man never to have run for president.</p> <p>There was a good reason why Bill Clinton\u2019s team was so worried Powell might run for election as the Republican nominee in 1996: because he could have won, and reshaped the political landscape for a generation.</p> <p>Instead he served another president who spent his first term siding with Powell\u2019s haters. Like Tony Blair, Powell was na\u00efve to think he could talk sense into George W Bush, or outflank his arch enemies, Dick Cheney and Donald Rumsfeld.</p> <p>They set him up as the fall guy for their half-baked case for war, cashing in on his credibility. They filled the first draft of his UN speech with bogus reports linking Saddam Hussein to 9/11, leaving Powell\u2019s team no time and no room to weed out all their fabrications. Still he later called the speech a painful and devastating moment: a permanent blot on his record, as he put it.</p> <p>That directness is what shines through the emails, along with a sharp sense of political and media analysis.</p> <p>Quite rightly, Powell is uncomfortable about condemning every Trump eruption because the response merely adds fuel to the fire. \u201cYou guys are playing his game, you are his oxygen,\u201d he wrote to one would-be interviewer. \u201cI will watch and pick the timing, not respond to the latest outrage.\u201d</p> <p>He put it more succinctly in another email: \u201cTo go on and call him an idiot just emboldens him.\u201d</p> <p>Powell is also blunt about Hillary Clinton\u2019s failings, especially the effort to excuse her use of a private email server by pointing to his email use in the state department.</p> <p>\u201cHRC could have killed this two years ago by merely telling everyone honestly what she had done and not tie me into it,\u201d he wrote late last month. \u201cI told her staff three times not to try that gambit. I had to throw a mini-tantrum at a Hamptons party to get their attention. She keeps tripping into these \u2018character\u2019 minefields.\u201d</p> <p>There is surely the opening of a whole book chapter in that Hamptons party. Obama likes to say that the smallness of our politics doesn\u2019t match the magnitude of our challenges. You don\u2019t get much smaller than a mini-tantrum about an email server.</p> <p>\u201cI would rather not have to vote for her, although she is a friend I respect,\u201d Powell <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/15/us/politics/colin-powell-emails-hack-donald-trump.html?hp&amp;action=click&amp;pgtype=Homepage&amp;clickSource=story-heading&amp;module=first-column-region&amp;region=top-news&amp;WT.nav=top-news&amp;_r=0\">wrote</a> in another email, that described her \u201cunbridled ambition\u201d and her husband\u2019s unbridled libido.</p> <p>Naturally, Trump has shown none of Powell\u2019s self-control or strategic thinking in responding to the hacked emails.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>\u201cI was never a fan of Colin Powell after his weak understanding of weapons of mass destruction in Iraq = disaster,\u201d Trump <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/776269061823074304\">tweeted</a> on Thursday morning. \u201cWe can do much better!\u201d</p> <p>This from a real estate developer who supported the invasion of Iraq and has repeatedly lied about it throughout the course of the campaign. But as Powell says, calling him an idiot just emboldens him. So we will just have to settle with deplorable.</p> <p>Powell likes to tell the story of a post-Soviet meeting of security officials in Europe. There he was confronted by an old Russian general who chastised him for wanting to keep Nato alive when the Warsaw Pact had died. Powell grinned as he recounted his reply: \u201cIt\u2019s hard to close a club that people still want to join. I can\u2019t help it if my club is more popular than yours.\u201d</p> <p>Powell\u2019s personal club remains more popular than anybody else\u2019s. Not least because he never ran for president, never suffering the kind of reputational damage that is strewn across that battlefield.</p> <p>As the Russian hackers have unwittingly revealed, Powell remains a sharp observer of presidential politics, no matter whose club you belong to.</p>",

  "<p>This coming Monday, 19 September, is the feast day of Saint Theodore of Tarsus (602-690), one of my political heroes. Born in modern-day Turkey, he fled the approaching Muslim army and ended up as archbishop of Canterbury, where, among other things, he invented the parish system. If localism has a patron saint, he is a Turkish immigrant. For the parish system became not just the basic unit of ecclesiastical government, but also, for centuries, our basic unit of social togetherness. The whole idea of a priest and a parish was the very infrastructure of local community. With the shop and the pub, it came to define what we meant by the local. This was where roots were set, where generations were born and died, where the British values of social togetherness were nurtured. It was perhaps the single most important moral contribution of the church to British society. It\u2019s where the \u201cwe\u201d has precedence over the \u201cI\u201d.</p> <p>But localism is now much derided. On a plane back from Israel last week, passing the time with in-flight entertainment, I am subjected to the most excruciating <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/149172139\">advertisement for Pullman hotels</a>. The music pulsates. A young man is going for a run in Shanghai, off to some high-powered meeting, then returning to his hotel. The narrator sounds sexy and enticing. \u201cNo frontiers, no borders, no limits. You are the beautiful nomads. And our world is your playground.\u201d I shuddered. What morally vacuous sentiments.</p> <p>I thought of all the people I might be literally flying over, risking everything, desperate to escape the misery of Syrian barrel bombs. No frontiers? No borders? Beautiful nomads? The contrast was offensive, sick. For millions, born with the wrong sort of passport, the world is a vale of tears, a daily struggle for survival and the survival of their children. These people squeeze themselves through razor wire and face the daily rejection of strangers. How they must loathe the easy entitlement of the beautiful nomad, ugly with self-worth, for whom \u201cour world is your playground\u201d. And, yes, I feel convicted by that description too.</p> <p>The philosophy of the beautiful nomad is often called liberalism. It\u2019s the philosophy of the unfettered self, free from restraint, free from the tiresome constraints of place and the local. Indeed, from the perspective of this liberal cosmopolitanism, the local community is a place to escape from, to grow out of, a place of narrow-minded sameness, a place to go back to at Christmas, but nothing more. Asked where he came from, the philosopher Diogenes replied that he was \u201ca citizen of the world\u201d.</p> <p>The beautiful nomad would think it an outrage that they\u2019d have to pay for a visa to travel to Europe, for instance.</p> <p>Michael Oakeshott, another philosopher, shows us how beautiful nomads are made. He argues that it is precisely the job of liberal education to sever people from their attachments to the local: \u201cEach of us is born in a corner of the earth,\u201d he writes. \u201cBut school and university are where a learner is emancipated from the limitations of his local circumstances. They are sheltered places where excellence may be heard because the din of local partialities is no more than a distant rumble.\u201d</p> <p>The values of the beautiful nomad are the opposite of those of Theodore and his community-orientated parishes. Here in the parish, what we mean by \u201csocial mobility\u201d is helping the elderly get to the shops. And not about clever youngsters moving onwards and upwards, cutting themselves off from their roots and their background, rarely to return.</p> <p>I know why the people of Syria leave their homes and seek a new place to live. Most of them would prefer to have stayed put. But they need safety. And we should welcome them. They are not hopping around. They want to settle. No, it is the beautiful nomad that is the dangerous creature. Having little respect for roots or for locality, s/he is the digital \u00fcbermensch, the epitome of capitalist entitlement that believes only in the things that s/he has made, bought or chosen. And like a locust, the rapacious consumption of the beautiful nomad turns the world into a desert. \u201cIt\u2019s not about where you are,\u201d advises the Pullman advert. Place is unimportant. Just consume and move on.</p> <p><em>Twitter: </em><em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/giles_fraser\">@giles_fraser</a></em><br></p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 16 September 2016.

  "<p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to scene-steal,\u201d Felicity Montagu tells me. But perhaps she just can\u2019t help herself, given the whirlwind of accents \u2013 Aussie, northern, estuary, RP \u2013 that she uses to animate her anecdotes in our hour together. Certainly, she has pinched scenes from some of comedy\u2019s biggest names \u2013 whether as Lynn, the tight-lipped, long-suffering PA to Alan Partridge, or as Sue, the voluptuous, cake-scoffing vicar\u2019s wife in <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLfzskRj5Yo\">Nighty Night</a>. Then there\u2019s that <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfwBwk7k3Gs\">hugely satisfying scene</a> in the first Bridget Jones film, where Montagu\u2019s sloaney Perpetua \u2013 all Alice band, pearls and raised eyebrows \u2013 rises sharply from her swivel chair to witness Bridget quit her job. \u201cBecause if she gives one inch,\u201d snarls Perpetua, \u201cI\u2019m going to fire her bony little bottom anyway for being totally spineless!\u201d</p> <p>We meet in a south London rehearsal room where Montagu is preparing to appear on stage in a new adaptation of the book that inspired Bridget Jones: <a href=\"https://openairtheatre.com/production/pride-and-prejudice-2016\">Pride and Prejudice</a>. She plays \u2013 who else? \u2013 Mrs Bennet, joining the roll-call of character actors from Alison Steadman to Brenda Blethyn who have brought those infamous Longbourn nerves to life. The danger, Montagu says, \u201cis overplaying the comedy. Mrs Bennet is a woman who is just ferociously in a hurry to get her five daughters married because of the poorhouse. If her husband dies, she knows she could be out on her arse.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmpwe80FFsU\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/kmpwe80FFsU?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>Watch Felicity Montagu in I\u2019m Alan Partridge</figcaption> </figure>   <p>From Armando Iannucci to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2015/dec/06/julia-davis-i-like-that-really-repressed-stuff-you-can-kick-against\">Julia Davis</a>, Montagu has worked with some of the best comedy writers in the business \u2013 and Jane Austen is no different. That is to say, she\u2019s brutally honest, sometimes to the point of cruelty. But Montagu balks in rehearsals when people say how awful her character is. \u201cNo! Mrs Bennet just comes from her own perspective. She\u2019s really only herself at three in the morning when she\u2019s pacing the bedroom or the parlour, worrying about stuff. She wants to make things happen, but she gets things wrong. She\u2019s headstrong and temperamental. And she\u2019s very attention-seeking because, socially, she\u2019s feels quite inadequate.\u201d<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>As for Austen, Montagu thinks she was \u201ca very profound writer, but I don\u2019t think I\u2019d have liked her as a person. She had a very cruel eye on women. And some of her characters are so sententious, like Elizabeth Bennet. She\u2019s not funny, she\u2019s serious. She\u2019s a good girl but I do think: lighten up, love! People take themselves so seriously, people who are control freaks, people who are narcissists. Life is too short \u2013 I lost my mother, just like that. I was lucky I was 29. I wasn\u2019t 13, I wasn\u2019t eight. But you have to treasure what you have and be joyful, as much as you can. And when terrible things happen to you, you have to say, well, just let\u2019s move on and shut the doors on it.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"33a03c7fa6713e42591f688258a700699ccc957d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/33a03c7fa6713e42591f688258a700699ccc957d/0_0_5760_3840/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Felicity Montagu (centre) in rehearsal for Pride and Prejudice at Regents Park theatre in London.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Felicity Montagu (centre) in rehearsal for Pride and Prejudice at Regent\u2019s Park theatre in London.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Johan Persson</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The youngest of five children, Montagu grew up in Yorkshire, her mother a beguiling, intellectual woman from Brisbane, her British father an army man from a long line of army men, who served in Burma and India before going into industry.

The show was inspired by a package holiday they had taken to Fuerteventura in the Canary Islands. \u201cWe\u2019ve always had a rough and tumble relationship,\u201d says Montagu. \u201cForever catching up with each other because I was grieving when I gave birth and then I got very ill and was in hospital for weeks.\u201d A pre-fame <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2003/jan/29/familyandrelationships.healthandwellbeing\">Gina Ford</a>, the childcare guru, was Olivia\u2019s baby nurse. \u201cShe was whipped away and taken home because I couldn\u2019t breastfeed her.

Her mother sent her to dance lessons from an early age \u2013 \u201cshe didn\u2019t want me to get fat\u201d \u2013 while her father marched her to the bank manager when, at 18, she announced she wanted to act. Despite his reservations, he agreed to be her guarantor and Montagu made good on the loan. After drama school, she was cast in Terry Johnson\u2019s Unsuitable for Adults at the Bush in London. Roles at the Royal Court and the National followed before the first of many television credits, on Victoria Wood Presents. \u201cBless her cotton socks,\u201d she says of the late comedian. \u201cShe\u2019s a terrible loss for my generation.

Her family questioned the official account, in a rural county with a long history of racism, that she had hanged herself. </p> <p>Cannon Lambert, attorney for Geneva Reed-Veal, told multiple media outlets on Thursday there is an agreement with the Texas department of public safety and Waller County to bring an end to the federal civil rights action, which <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/news/sandra-bland-family-reaches-million-settlement-texas-authorities/\">had been scheduled for trial in January</a>.</p> <p>However, an attorney for Waller County said the settlement agreement was still only provisional. </p> <p>\u201cA potential settlement agreement has been reached, but is not yet final,\u201d Larry J Simmons said. \u201cThe parties are still working through a few details. In addition, the potential settlement must be approved by the Waller County commissioner\u2019s court, which has not yet occurred.\u201d</p> <p>Lambert told the Guardian he disputed the characterisation of the agreement as still in doubt and described the deal, which he said was made on Wednesday evening, as \u201cunprecedented\u201d for what the county has pledged to do in addition to the payment.</p> <p>\u201cYou have substantial changes that are taking place at the jail, where the jail from here forward, it\u2019s going to be using automated electronic sensors to ensure the accuracy of timing and checks of the detainees in their cells. That\u2019s going to help prevent any sort of document falsification going forward,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cIn addition they\u2019re going to have a nurse and/or EMT [emergency medical technician] that\u2019s going to be on duty for all shifts. Those two things in themselves are huge, but over and above that the Waller County judge has pledged that he will actively pursue state legislation in Texas for more funding to help improve intake booking, screening, training and the like.\u201d</p> <p>Lambert said any laws that stem from those efforts were set to be named in Bland\u2019s honour, while the jail will also train and re-train its employees on a continuing basis.</p> <p>Of the money going to the family, he said, the Texas department of public safety will be liable for $100,000, the maximum allowable under state law, with the county \u2013 or its insurers \u2013 to contribute the remaining $1.8m.</p> <p>After a state trooper pulled Bland over in July last year, their exchange escalated into a verbal and physical conflict, with trooper Brian Encinia forcing Bland out of her car and threatening to tase her. On a video of the stop, Bland is heard screaming in pain.</p> <p>Bland, 28, had just moved from the Chicago area to the county near Houston to start a job at Prairie View A&amp;M University, her alma mater. </p> <p>Her family\u2019s questioning of the official account of her death prompted intense <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jul/25/sandra-bland-suspicion-mistrust-official-inconsistencies\">national scrutiny</a> on the circumstances of her arrest and death, and a raft of conspiracy theories. Activists continue to mount vigils and protests, while the road where she was stopped has been formally renamed Sandra Bland Parkway.</p> <p>An autopsy concluded that Bland hanged herself using a plastic trash bag. Jail intake questionnaires gave conflicting details as to Bland\u2019s likely mental health in the hours after her arrest.</p> <p>The Texas Commission on Jail Standards cited the jail three days after Bland\u2019s death for failing to conduct face-to-face observation of all inmates at least once an hour, and for inadequate training on how to handle potentially suicidal inmates.</p> <p>The incident spurred Texas lawmakers <a href=\"https://www.texastribune.org/2016/07/08/one-year-later-sandra-bland-remains-center-stage/\">to examine</a> jail standards and possible criminal justice reforms.</p> <p>The Waller County sheriff, Glenn Smith, commissioned a panel to examine his department\u2019s performance. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/apr/12/sandra-bland-jail-report-texas-black-lives-matter\">Last April it produced a report </a>calling for a new jail, improved procedures and greater respect to be shown towards suspects.</p> <p>Bland\u2019s mother, Reed-Veal, filed the wrongful death lawsuit in August last year. It alleged that jailers failed to respond properly when Bland showed signs of distress and that she was placed alone in a cell \u201cwith a variety of inappropriate items \u2026 including a large garbage can, garbage bags, exposed beams, cords and other items\u201d. Attorneys for Waller County argued that Bland killed herself because she became upset when no one posted bail for her.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jul/28/not-white-thing-suicide-african-americans\">It's not a \u2018white thing\u2019: the mythology of suicide in black American lives</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In court earlier this year, attorneys for Bland and for the defendants clashed over access to evidence, with Bland\u2019s lawyers seeking access to a detailed report produced by the Texas Rangers which has not been made public. A judge ordered the parties into mediation in July.</p> <p>Simmons added the Waller County defendants \u201cvigorously deny any fault or wrongdoing, and the potential settlement does not involve any such admissions\u201d.</p> <p>Lambert said: \u201cThere\u2019s 1.9 million admissions that illustrate that they recognise and acknowledge their failure.\u201d</p> <p>The Texas DPS, which fired Encinia, did not respond to a request for comment.

This would involve a new approach to enforcing free market rules, he went on, singling out EU state aid rules as a particular issue.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Any deal with the EU must recognise that the old state aid rules are no longer valid.</p> <p>When governments across the world are intervening, it makes no sense to tie a government\u2019s hands here.</p> </blockquote> <p>Later, in response to a question, Corbyn said that he was not saying Britain should reject a trade deal with the EU after Brexit if it involved accepting state aid rules; he just wanted Britain to be able to adopt a flexible approach to state aid, as Germany, France and Italy seem to be allowed to do, he said.

That release came from the campaign. It didn\u2019t come from Jeremy. And we\u2019ve apologised. It was just inappropriate. One of our researchers saw a bit of incoming flak and then did a list of all the statements that have been made by other MPs, some of which were not particularly kind, let\u2019s put it that way. It was a briefing note. It shouldn\u2019t have gone out. And we apologised for that.</p> <p>It certainly was not a list in any way to attack anyone. It was just a factual report.</p> </blockquote> <p>McDonnell said that he was \u201cabsolutely furious\u201d about the release of the list because the Corbyn team are \u201crebuilding relations\u201d with Corbyn\u2019s critics. He says almost the whole PLP (parliamentary Labour party) backed Corbyn\u2019s stance in PMQs yesterday on grammar schools. He said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The thing about last night, that going out, it just set us back. And I was furious about that, to be frank, absolutely furious. And just at a time when we were rebuilding relations. I hope it hasn\u2019t set us back. And we will certainly have a conversation with all those involved.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>Corbyn said he never resorted to using abusive comments himself.</strong></li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I, as you know, never abuse anybody, tempting as it sometimes is.

I won a seat back for Labour last year after 30 years. I should be out this morning with the CWU in my constituency campaigning to keep a post office.

He claimed that a third of members have yet to vote.</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The release of this list, and the victim culture it is trying to perpetuate, is an example of how nervous [Corbyn] is, and his team are, about the result. I think a third of members are yet to even vote in this. And Jeremy and his team know they have put a lot of people off through their incompetence over the last year who do not want to vote for them again this time around.</p> <p>For those members who have not voted yet, this is another demonstration of the kind of lack of leadership, the kind of division, that Jeremy and John McDonnell want to perpetuate if they win again. And look at the permissive culture they have created of abuse against Labour MPs, and especially women MPs.</p> <p>Jess Phillips has had months and months of abuse, a torrent of abuse, from Corbynistas and the like. And she has been put on this list again. That is a dereliction of duty. That is not leadership. That is Jeremy telling his trolls online to carry on. He is giving them a green light to continue their abuse. If Labour members don\u2019t want that abuse to continue, they really need to choose Owen [Smith] while they\u2019ve still got a chance in this leadership election.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>He said he would be talking to a lawyer about possible legal action.</strong></li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I\u2019ve already asked for an explanation from Jeremy, I\u2019ve already been in touch with the chief whip\u2019s office, I have already been in touch with the party chair and the general secretary of the party. I do want an answer and I will be speaking to a lawyer tomorrow.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>He called for a written apology from Corbyn. That would help resolve the matter, he said.</strong></li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>He strongly rejected the claim that he had been abusive towards Corbyn</strong>.

If he had something to say, he said it openly, he said.</p> <ul> <li><strong>He claimed it was hypocritical of Corbyn to refuse to accept criticism given his own record as a backbencher.</strong></li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Jeremy was the most rebellious backbencher for 30 years and yet somehow - it\u2019s utter hypocrisy really - does not like it when his own backbenchers disagree with him. Instead of challenges, instead of having a debate with us, he goes out and issues a silly little list like they did in January instead of having a debate and building that policy platform that we need to win.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>He particularly criticised the decision to include Ben Bradshaw on the list. </strong>Bradshaw was the only Labour MP in the south west, he said.

There are huge economic interests but there are also red lines. It is very well known that freedom of movement is one of those red lines. \u201cIt is very difficult for the European Union to do something else vis a vis Britain compared to what we agreed upon with Norway and Switzerland. </p> <p>The big question is, even if there is some room for manoeuvre, is this sufficient for the British negotiators?

  "<p>Seven years ago, Dr Charles Runels\u2019 lover surprised him at his office, demanding that he inject blood into her clitoris as a Valentine\u2019s Day present. She hiked up her dress, hopped on to the exam table and motioned for Runels to put on his headlamp. She explained that she\u2019d been watching him inject his own penis with blood for about a year, and that while his bigger and stronger erections had been fun, she\u2019d grown tired of the one-sided sexual enhancement. It was her turn. So Runels bowed between her legs, numbed her clitoris with an ice cube and shot her up. </p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know how graphic you can be with this thing,\u201d he said over the phone, pausing mid-story to ask me about the Guardian\u2019s policy on discussing orgasms. \u201cBut the next afternoon, she came to see me, and her orgasms came more quickly \u2013 very strong, ejaculatory orgasms. The passion, the thunder, the sounds that she was making \u2026\u201d</p> <p>He sighed at the memory.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s when I thought: I should try this on my patients.\u201d</p> <p>And just like that, the O-Shot was born. </p> <p>The non-surgical treatment that aims to facilitate and improve orgasms in women, which Runels trademarked in 2011, can only be performed by him or one of the more than 500 certified practitioners he\u2019s trained over the years. It has two steps: first, he extracts PRP, or platelet-rich plasma, from a woman\u2019s blood (usually taken from her arm). He then re-inserts it into the clitoris and the ceiling of her vagina with a syringe. The infusion of white blood cells, according to Runels, increases lubrication and sensitivity, allowing the patient to reach climax easily. </p> <p>Today, more than 20,000 women have had the procedure done, and Runels estimates an 85% success rate. In the mainstream medical community, however, the O-Shot is controversial; its findings are viewed as inadequately tested (it\u2019s not FDA approved) and some question whether its effects boil down to nothing more than placebo.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>For Runels, the ability to have good orgasms is essential to a woman\u2019s overall wellbeing</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>But Runels insists the procedure changes lives. He also claims it can cure incontinence and pain during sex caused by anything ranging from scarring after childbirth, to post-radiation dryness and even female genital mutilation (FGM). For Runels, the ability to have good orgasms \u201cempowers\u201d assault victims and is essential to a woman\u2019s \u201coverall wellbeing\u201d. </p> <p>In others words, this is a man obsessed with making women come.</p> <p>As I listened to him describe the procedure and his philosophy, I wondered: who was this man who\u2019d dedicated so much of his life to helping women orgasm? What was behind Runels\u2019 fixation? Was he a feminist revolutionary? Or a total creep? </p> <p>I booked a flight to Alabama to find out. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"3c1ef963915875cda3eb2ba6c651b66357f0f0c8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3c1ef963915875cda3eb2ba6c651b66357f0f0c8/0_320_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Dr Charles Runels does an O-Shot procedure on a patient inside his clinic in Fairhope, Alabama, with help from staff member Danielle Gautier.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dr Charles Runels does an O-Shot procedure on a patient inside his clinic in Fairhope, Alabama, with help from staff member Danielle Gautier.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bryan Tarnowski/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>\u2022\u2022\u2022</h2> <p>Fairhope, Alabama (population 5,326) is an unlikely place to find a man trying to revolutionize women\u2019s sexual health. Runels admits that living \u201cin the buckle of the Bible belt\u201d \u2013 where vibrators are literally illegal, thanks to the state\u2019s Anti-Obscenity Enforcement Act \u2013 poses certain drawbacks.</p> <p>\u201cBut as long as you\u2019re not too open about it, you can find the free-thinking people,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Still, peddling clit injections seemed like a hard sell. </p> <p>Runels\u2019 office isn\u2019t anything like the sterile exam rooms most women associate with gynecological exams. It\u2019s intimate, personal and cozy \u2013 because in addition to treating thousands of patients there over the years, he also lives there. The small entryway opens on to a living room dominated by gym equipment. In the bathroom, I found a functioning shower and shelves filled with employees\u2019 toiletries. The only examination table was separated from the kitchen by a curtain. </p> <p>Pamela, Julie and Vivienne \u2013 the three women on Runels\u2019 four-person staff \u2013 greeted me with open arms. In order to better understand what they promoted, Pamela and Vivienne told me they\u2019d both had O-Shots administered by Runels. (Mark, the sole male employee, opted for the male version, a \u201cP-Shot\u201d.)</p> <p>When I asked whether it was weird for any of them that their employer had seen their genitals, they laughed: \u201cOf course not!\u201d Pamela had never felt better; she said she enjoyed multiple orgasms now.

She told me that doctors regularly flew in from all over the world to be trained in the procedure, and that initially they reacted to offers of free O-Shots just as I had \u2013 with a mix of embarrassment and surprise. But by the end, she said, everyone wanted one.<br></p> <p>She and Runels laughed, recalling how the last class had run until three in the morning, just to accommodate demand. \u201cIt\u2019s like a Baptist revival, except you\u2019re injecting each other\u2019s genitals,\u201d he said. </p> <p>I assured them I wasn\u2019t interested. Runels looked at me and said: \u201cDon\u2019t be surprised if you change your mind.\u201d</p> <h2>\u2022\u2022\u2022</h2> <p>Throughout this piece, I\u2019ve changed O-Shot recipients\u2019 names \u2013 including those of Runels\u2019 employees \u2013 in order to protect their identities. Many live in the small, Christian community of Fairhope and fear ostracism.

But soon her father \u201cnoticed something different\u201d about her and started calling her a \u201cwhore and a lesbian\u201d. Physical abuse followed when Lacey\u2019s next rapist, her husband, found himself unable to climax unless Lacey was in excruciating pain. He raped her throughout their 10-year relationship, and left her with herpes, incontinence and vaginal scarring. </p> <p>At 29 years old, she wet the bed, had never had an orgasm and thought her vagina was deformed. Doctors responded to her concerns by suggesting lube and psychotherapy. </p> <p>At 30, Lacey never expected to experience sexual pleasure again. She tried using a back massager for stimulus, but it left a painful callous on her clitoris. Later she met Runels at the bank where she worked. After learning what he did, she confided in him, and Runels said he knew of something that might help \u2013 or, at the very least, something that would not hurt her. </p> <p>Lacey got the O-Shot on her lunch break, and immediately \u201cfelt alive down there\u201d. Over the next few weeks the callous slowly disappeared, revealing healthy, circulated tissue. Her incontinence went away. </p> <p>But more than anything, Lacey felt healed by her newfound ability to orgasm; before the shot, climaxing, if it happened at all, had taken about half an hour of \u201cjackhammering friction\u201d. After the shot, she switched to a gentle (and illegal \u2013 remember, this is Alabama) finger vibrator, and came within seconds.

It\u2019s time for us to quit avoiding the subject of a woman\u2019s sexual function, and actually start thinking about how the system of her sexuality might work.\u201d</p> <p>Wasn\u2019t it strange, he wondered, that when it came to a woman\u2019s health, we talked about her body only in terms of a reproductive system?</p> <p>He gestured to the plastic female pelvis on his bookshelf. \u201cWhat about an orgasm system?\u201d he said.</p> <h2>\u2022\u2022\u2022</h2> <p>As someone who enjoys orgasms, I agree with Runels that they\u2019re \u201cimportant\u201d, but I\u2019m not a scientist. So I set out to fact-check his claim that orgasms help women feel better (and the implied reverse claim: that the absence of orgasms counts as sexual dysfunction) against what we already know.<br></p> <p>But it turns that we don\u2019t know very much. </p> <p>I mined academic periodicals for information on the interplay between orgasms and health. But as far as I could tell, such studies tended to center on male sexual dysfunction in the wake of prostate cancer. It seemed like scientists were eager to investigate the devastating effects of surgery on a man\u2019s inability to ejaculate, while a female cancer survivors\u2019 sexuality only mattered in terms of whether she could still have children. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0f2b3f6eecdeda83fbf15cf2555837cf6c0a55cb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0f2b3f6eecdeda83fbf15cf2555837cf6c0a55cb/0_170_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Diagrams and models of male and female reproductive systems sit next to incense and a photo of Dr Runels\u2019 parents.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Diagrams and models of male and female reproductive systems sit next to incense and a photo of Dr Runels\u2019 parents.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bryan Tarnowski/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Disgruntled by the academic definition of women\u2019s health as \u201ccancer\u201d or \u201cbabies\u201d, I extended my search to female orgasms in general, and I found that research devoted to the subject often revolved around questions such as \u2013 and I\u2019m paraphrasing here \u2013 \u201cIs female ejaculation a real thing?\u201d or \u201cWhy does the female orgasm even exist?\u201d </p> <p>As for how orgasms (or the lack thereof) might relate to a woman\u2019s health or happiness? Academics aren\u2019t interested.</p> <h2>\u2022\u2022\u2022</h2> <p>Many in the mainstream medical community see the O-Shot as little more than a placebo. </p> <p>When I asked Dr Jennifer Gunter, an OB/GYN who writes frequently about female sexuality, what she thought about Runels and his techniques, she screamed.</p> <p>\u201cYou don\u2019t do procedures on partners! I want to vomit,\u201d she said. \u201cYou\u2019re not supposed to practice medicine on your family and friends \u2026 oh my God. Talk about a power differential.\u201d</p> <p>Though some hail the O-Shot as a much-needed advancement in women\u2019s sexual health, many doctors are skeptical of Runels \u2013 and his methods. Gunter told me that Runels\u2019 close relationships with some O-Shot recipients enhanced the likelihood of placebo \u2013 that, whether or not they knew it, these women wanted Runels to feel good about himself. </p> <p>She explained that in order to take the O-Shot seriously, she\u2019d first want to see somebody do a study on \u201c10 rat vaginas\u201d. She pointed out that Runels\u2019 procedure had not yet been approved by the FDA, and compared the potential unknown side-effects to those that might be associated with the unregulated use of a vaginal mesh.</p> <p>She laughed. \u201cTo get something approved by the FDA is a very low bar. You basically have to prove you didn\u2019t kill 20 people \u2013 I mean, I don\u2019t know what it was, exactly. [But] the body can do really weird crazy things.

But an <em>untested</em> procedure on your sexual partners?\u201d<br> </p> <p>As as I could tell, the word \u201cuntested\u201d seemed up for debate \u2013 according to Runels, it had been tested; using funds from his medical group, Runels had recently financed a $95,000 study to test the effect of the O-Shot on vulvar lichen sclerosus, a dermatological, eczema-like condition which produces cracking and bleeding around the vagina, led by George Washington University faculty member and lichen sclerosus expert Dr Andrew Goldstein. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>To get something approved by the FDA is a very low bar.

(This paper has since been published in the Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease.) </p> <p>Gunter, who specialized in lichen sclerosus and had previously warred with Runels on Twitter, said she\u2019d seen the paper but couldn\u2019t take it seriously, since it only involved nine participants \u2013 \u201cIt\u2019s a case series, not a study\u201d \u2013 not to mention that the overall absence of a placebo group ruined its findings. When I asked Gunter what she thought about the participants\u2019 feedback, which was apparently positive, she explained to me the difference between actual evidence (numbers) and anecdotal evidence (human testimony).</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3df78f87c9872197aff8bd313561473168efe8d3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3df78f87c9872197aff8bd313561473168efe8d3/0_15_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Dr Charles Runels shows the PRP (platelet-rich plasma) to a patient, which comes from the blood of the patient themselves and is the secret behind the O-Shot.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dr Charles Runels shows the PRP (platelet-rich plasma) to a patient, which comes from the blood of the patient themselves and is the secret behind the O-Shot.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bryan Tarnowski/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I had trouble with the idea that a woman\u2019s feedback was purely anecdotal. Didn\u2019t dismissing a woman\u2019s sexuality as a psychological issue implicitly throw into question her ability to describe what was happening to her body?</p> <p>Gunter countered that the dermatological issues associated with lichen sclerosus were categorically separate from sexual function. She had patients \u201cin their 50s, 60s\u201d with lichen sclerosus who didn\u2019t even care about sex \u201cbecause their husbands were impotent\u201d.</p> <p>I flinched at this. Wasn\u2019t it sort of a double standard to say that if man can\u2019t get erection, he\u2019s \u201cimpotent\u201d \u2013 in other words: he has sexual dysfunction whether he wants it or not, but a woman only has it if it bothers her? </p> <p>Why did diagnoses of sexual dysfunction appear to be split along gender lines, considered either physical or psychosomatic depending on the presence or absence of an erection?</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Why do diagnoses of dysfunction appear split along gender lines, dependent on the presence or absence of an erection?</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Gunter sighed. Apparently I was conflating two separate fields. She urged me to run some of the scenarios I\u2019d mentioned (injecting lovers, injecting employees) by a bioethics expert. </p> <p>So I contacted Tim Caulfield, a professor at the University of Alberta\u2019s school of law and school of public health.</p> <p>Caulfield told me that PRP first became \u201csexy\u201d in 2013, when NBA players such as Kobe Bryant started getting the injections to heal athletic injuries. That same year, blood injections rocketed into the world of trendy cosmetics when doctors in Miami gave Kim Kardashian a \u201cvampire facelift\u201d (another of Runels\u2019 trademarked PRP procedures, it turns out, where blood is dripped all over the T-zone while attacking the area with needles). </p> <p>Afterward, Kardashian posted a selfie of her blood-soaked face (when the photo went viral, her doctor received an official \u201ccease and desist\u201d call from Runels, who explained he owned the trademark). But despite its popularity in mainstream media, Caulfield said that the actual science behind PRP was \u201ciffy\u201d at best. </p> <p>Like Gunter, he brought up the placebo effect \u2013 and, in particular, \u201cplacebo theater\u201d. He explained that white coats, medical lingo and especially the presence of needles combine to heighten a patient\u2019s anticipation that a treatment will work. </p> <p>The O-Shot ranged in price from $1,200-$1,500, and controlled studies have shown that more costly treatments increased the placebo effect \u2013 an effect that is so strong, it has been shown to actually create physical improvement in Parkinson\u2019s symptoms. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Studies have shown that more costly treatments increased the placebo effect \u2013 and can even improve Parkinson's symptoms</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Was my kneejerk reaction to stand up for Runels predicated on subconscious insecurity? As a journalist, did I need to believe so badly that I\u2019d come to Fairhope for a reason \u2013 that I\u2019d not been lured in by a campaign for snake oil \u2013 that I was refusing to entertain reason?<br></p> <h2>\u2022\u2022\u2022</h2> <p>Later during my visit to Runels\u2019 clinic, I was sitting down for lunch \u2013 idly asking him why he\u2019d trademarked the name of his procedures \u2013 when suddenly he stabbed a giant needle through the lid of my sushi container.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0cac6bf1840b209d54755123a0131ced71f2b035\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0cac6bf1840b209d54755123a0131ced71f2b035/0_349_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Runels uses the skull during his doctor training sessions to help illustrate where to inject when doing the vampire facelift procedure.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Runels uses the skull during his doctor training sessions to help illustrate where to inject when doing the vampire facelift procedure.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bryan Tarnowski/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cThat,\u201d he said, gesturing theatrically at my impaled take-out box, \u201cis why I trademark my ideas.\u201d He explained that an individual claiming to administer the O-Shot had once stuck \u201ca mixing needle\u201d \u2013 which is about the size of a cocktail spear, and should only be used to pierce rubber \u2013 into a woman\u2019s clitoris, endangering her physical safety. </p> <p>Owning the O-Shot name enabled Runels to mine the term online, ensuring that practitioners who offered it had trained with him. Runels paid his lawyer $30,000-$50,000 a month just to track down and send cease-and-desist letters to anyone who advertised the O-Shot without having trained with Runels or someone in his medical group.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Runels paid his lawyer $30,000-$50,000 a month to send cease-and-desist letters to anyone who advertised the O-Shot</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Two of Runels\u2019 assistants, Pamela and Julie, entered to tell me Julie would be getting the O-Shot \u2013 <em>right then \u2013 </em>so I could witness how painless it was. Julie explained that this wasn\u2019t just for my benefit \u2013 that she was 50 years old, had suffered incontinence since having kids and was hoping the O-Shot would help. So I put away my sushi and followed her through the curtain. Moments later, in an awkward attempt to make conversation while I sat between her legs, I said: \u201cYour vagina looks like my vagina.\u201d<br></p> <p>\u201cOh, good,\u201d Julie said, sounding relieved as she glanced down at her lap. She lay back, clutching Pamela\u2019s hand, explaining that she\u2019d always secretly thought that she might be \u201cdeformed down there\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cEveryone comes here thinking that,\u201d Pamela reassured her. </p> <p>Runels hummed his way into the room and after drawing blood from Julie\u2019s arm, he loaded it into the centrifuge and left us alone so that Pamela could lather on the numbing cream. She used her fingers to spread Julie\u2019s labia, gently coaxed the clitoris from its hood and applied the ointment. After giving it time to kick in, Runels returned to inject the lidocaine into the top crest of Julie\u2019s labia minora \u2013 at the point just before it branched into the base of the clitoris. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"23960dacf766915207e6816e2980eb5aa407bc82\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/23960dacf766915207e6816e2980eb5aa407bc82/0_384_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Runels performing an O-Shot procedure on a patient.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Runels performing an O-Shot procedure on a patient.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bryan Tarnowski/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I waited for Julie to cry out in pain. But instead she just kept talking to Pamela about church. Runels explained to me that this area of the labia wasn\u2019t sensitive (it was built to rip during childbirth) and that bloodflow would naturally take the lidocaine from the labia minora into the clitoris, making a direct injection unnecessary. We made small talk for a few minutes until she she was fully numb. Then Runels plucked the vial of her blood from the centrifuge, preparing for the final injection \u2013 a direct hit to the clit. The PRP floated on top, yellow and opaque, like dehydrated urine. </p> <p>While Runels flicked the needle, I ignored the taste of metal in my mouth, squeezed my thighs together and pretended everything was normal. But apparently my secondhand discomfort was unfounded; not only was the whole thing over in seconds, but afterward Julie said: \u201cIs it happening yet?\u201d \u2013 because the O-Shot felt like nothing.</p> <p>\u201cHow long will this last?\u201d she asked Runels.</p> <p>\u201cConservatively speaking, around nine months,\u201d he answered. He added that, in Lacey\u2019s case, results had persisted for nearly six years. </p> <p>Julie beamed at me, and I smiled back, saying I was happy for her \u2013 but the truth was, I couldn\u2019t get Dr Gunter\u2019s and Dr Caulfield\u2019s voices out of my head. Two smart and accomplished medical experts had insisted to me that satisfied O-Shot customers were dupes. </p> <p>As a layperson, I couldn\u2019t help but respect their authority. But as a human being, it was hard for me to discredit so many women\u2019s stories. When they said the O-Shot worked, I believed them.</p> <h2>\u2022\u2022\u2022</h2> <p>On my last day in Alabama, imaginary feuds between feminists and doctors and ethicists and patients ricocheted around my brain. I\u2019d talked to so many people, read too many papers, and still had no clue what to think about the O-Shot. </p> <p>So I asked Runels to inject my clitoris. </p> <p>\u201cThis is insane,\u201d a girlfriend texted me. \u201cYou don\u2019t even have sexual dysfunction!\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The procedure was brief and painless and within hours I was boarding my flight home, eager to put the O-Shot to the test</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>I responded with some defiant emojis. It wasn\u2019t orgasms I was struggling with \u2013 it was the conclusion to my article. So I stepped out of my jeans and held Pamela\u2019s hand while Runels tugged on the headlamp. \u201cIs it happening?\u201d I said \u2013 but it was over. The procedure was brief and painless, and within hours I was boarding my flight home, eager to put the O-Shot to the test.</p> <p>Unfortunately, results proved vague. </p> <p>Every time I had sex I would ask myself: does this feel better than it did before my clitoris was injected with blood?</p> <p>Even more mood-killing were the other questions pulsing through my mind: does having an orgasm as a result of this procedure make me a good or bad feminist? Have I taken a daring move by putting my clitoris first? Or have I sold out a century of progress by \u201cobeying\u201d Runels, a member of the patriarchy, who deluded me into thinking I needed him to fix me?\u201d </p> <p>These questions made sex worse. So I decided to depoliticize my body \u2013 to take psychology and medicine and feminism out of the equation, and forget I\u2019d ever met him.</p> <p>That did the trick. And it felt great. </p>",
  "<p>It is mid-afternoon and the Venice Lido is a ghost town baking in the sun. The film festival wound down the previous evening, and now the thoroughfare between the beach and the cinemas is deserted except for construction workers in threes and fours dismantling the decorations. The glitz has faded. The stars are gone.</p> <p>Well, most of them. Denzel Washington and Chris Pratt are the last men standing in this tumbleweed town. In the street, their faces loom menacingly out of the posters for the remake of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/sep/08/the-magnificent-seven-review-denzel-washington-chris-pratt-antoine-fuqua-toronto-film-festival-tiff\">The Magnificent Seven</a>, in which an ethnically diverse cast of outlaws and miscreants defend oppressed townsfolk from a brutal tyrant. Seated at a table in a hotel room, the actors appear somewhat less than magnificent. Washington is slumped in his seat. He is 61, heavy-set, tired-looking. He may be dressed in a baggy, grey T-shirt and jogging bottoms but his magnetism is undimmed. When he peers straight at you, there\u2019s a crackle of electricity in the air.

He sweats gravitas.</p> <p>His 37-year-old co-star \u2013 who is wearing jeans and a thin suede jacket, and sporting a sketchy beard \u2013 carries his fame more lightly. Pratt made his name as a deliriously dopey member of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/parks-and-recreation\">Parks and Recreation</a> ensemble. Superstardom only descended, though, once his loosey-goosey charms were transposed to a blockbuster setting in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/guardians-of-the-galaxy\">Guardians of the Galaxy</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/jurassic-world\">Jurassic World</a>.

With a cast list that offers a rebuke to conventional Hollywood casting (there\u2019s even a woman among the seven heroes) and a conflict that pits poor against rich, the movie is in the tradition of westerns that comment on our times, such as <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjjAHAmY-DU\">Soldier Blue</a> or <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/oct/19/wild-bunch-peckinpah-action\">The Wild Bunch</a>.

Pratt leans in. \u201cThere\u2019s definitely a conversation that\u2019s happening around the world and the movie seems to have become part of that. But that wasn\u2019t our intention. I\u2019m not the most articulate guy. I wish I were. So I\u2019m not gonna be the one to express it. At the end of the day, it\u2019s two hours of kickass entertainment.\u201d</p> <p>I try another tack. The villain, played by Peter Sarsgaard, is a greedy industrialist whose only love is for land and power. Any current presidential candidates spring to mind? Washington is having none of it. \u201cNah. That\u2019s what you may see. The audience may not.\u201d I\u2019m part of the audience, though. \u201cAre you? You gonna pay to see the movie?\u201d I\u2019ve already seen it. \u201cAre you gonna pay? Answer the question.\u201d I tell him I would do had I not seen it. I start to explain that I paid to see <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/feb/26/safe-house-review-denzel-washington\">Safe House</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/nov/28/unstoppable-denzel-washington-review\">Unstoppable</a> and many of his other films. But it\u2019s too late. He\u2019s already laughing and braying (\u201cA-ha! See? Right?\u201d) and wagging his finger triumphantly.</p> <p>\u201cThe average person who\u2019s paying to see it is just looking for a good time. When I did Cry Freedom, a doctor friend told me: \u2018Denzel, I have life and death in my hands every single day. I go to the movies to escape.\u2019 What I got from that was that just because it\u2019s important to me doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s important to the everyday person. We just try to give them enough to get the monkey off their back so they can feel like: \u2018Hey, I\u2019m Chris Pratt up there,\u2019 or \u2018I\u2019m Denzel.\u2019 It ain\u2019t that deep.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9f5d085a555697ebe074e1f3a43325d2dadd27ae\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9f5d085a555697ebe074e1f3a43325d2dadd27ae/79_0_1675_1005/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Chris Pratt in Guardians of the Galaxy.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Chris Pratt in Guardians of the Galaxy.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Uncredited/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I point out that films can easily contain both action and ideas. They\u2019re not mutually exclusive. He has starred in plenty of examples \u2013 Malcolm X, Crimson Tide, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2006/mar/26/philipfrench1\">Inside Man</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/jan/31/flight-review\">Flight</a>. \u201cSure,\u201d he concedes. The pressing issue now is why neither actor will offer even the most superficial interpretation of the new picture. Is there a danger that if they describe it as one thing \u2013 the \u201cdiversity western\u201d, say, or the \u201canti-Trump allegory\u201d \u2013 then it will become fixed as that forever? \u201cNo, there\u2019s a danger if <em>you</em> do,\u201d Washington tells me. \u201cHow many readers you got?\u201d I tell him what I can remember about circulation figures and online traffic. \u201cWhat an opportunity you have.\u201d He sits back in his seat in the manner of a statesman who has settled a complex debate decisively, rather than an actor who has avoided a question. He stares at me for a moment, then his face breaks into a smile. \u201cI\u2019m just messing witchoo,\u201d he says.</p> <p>Once again, Pratt steps in with a placatory aside. \u201cIt\u2019s tough these days. I\u2019m expecting people to talk about this movie and form their own opinions. I want theirs to be as valuable as mine. I\u2019m not a politician. I\u2019m not in the business of trying to shape people\u2019s opinions. I\u2019m an entertainer. I know there\u2019s a giant industry now of talking about stuff and saying stuff.\u201d</p> <p>Washington lunges forward, palms downwards on the table. \u201cToday\u2019s subject: phones,\u201d he says in the mock-authoritative voice of a news anchor. \u201cAre phones safe for you? We have three experts on the left. And three experts on the right. We\u2019ll be right back after this.\u201d Pratt launches into an advertising jingle \u2013 \u201cMaybe it\u2019s Maybelline!\u201d \u2013 and the two men rock back and forth, laughing raucously. I laugh too, although I\u2019m confused. Pratt\u2019s objection, as far as I can make out, is that people are prone to discussion. He sets me straight: \u201cI find myself kind of withdrawing a bit. Look, no one pays me for my opinion. If I say something stupid and it becomes a headline, it\u2019s, like: \u2018Guess what Chris said!\u2019 Then everyone clicks on this stupid thing I said.\u201d He looks into his lap. \u201cThis is going really well,\u201d he says quietly.</p> <p>I ask if they\u2019ve both simply resolved to keep personal and political opinions private. \u201cWould you?\u201d Washington shoots back. I tell him that if he asked me a question, I\u2019d answer it straight. \u201cWho would you vote for if you could vote in the US election?\u201d Easy. Hillary Clinton. And him? \u201cThat\u2019s private.\u201d Pratt perks up: \u201cI\u2019m writing \u2018Denzel\u2019 on the ballot,\u201d he says. More laughter.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/video/2013/jan/30/denzel-washington-robert-zemeckis-kelly-reilly-flight-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/3de55\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"1860548\"            data-video-name=\"Denzel Washington, Robert Zemeckis and Kelly Reilly on Flight: 'Superman really can't fly' - video\"            data-video-provider=\"guardian.co.uk\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-403247498\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/brightcove/2013/1/30/130130Flight2-16x9.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2013/1/30/130130Flight2_3gpLg16x9.3gp\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/connectedTV/1280/2013/1/30/130130Flight2-720.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/ad/130130Flight2/130130Flight2.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2013/1/30/130130Flight2_3gpSml16x9.3gp\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/video/2013/jan/30/denzel-washington-robert-zemeckis-kelly-reilly-flight-video\">Denzel Washington, Robert Zemeckis and Kelly Reilly on Flight: \u2018Superman really can\u2019t fly\u2019</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>In 1992, when Bill Clinton was elected, Washington <a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/interviews/denzel-washington-puts-power-behind-oratory\">said</a> he felt \u201ca little hope\u201d. I ask how he feels now and for a moment he looks like a man sick to death of having things he said more than 20 years ago read back to him. \u201cI hope so,\u201d he admits finally. Then it\u2019s back to entertainment. \u201cWhatever I\u2019m thinking doesn\u2019t have anything to do with the people who go see the movie to have fun. I never saw any movie because I read an article about it.\u201d Ah. Now the unspoken question hanging in the air is: why are we doing this interview?</p> <p>Instead, I steer it back to him. As a young actor, Washington was a big fan of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/james-earl-jones\">James Earl Jones</a>. Wouldn\u2019t he have been interested in Jones\u2019s opinions? He swivels round in his chair to address Pratt: \u201cI saw James Earl Jones do Oedipus the King. He was magnificent. I went backstage and he let me try on his rings in the dressing room. They were huge! And he had this big, booming voice.\u201d He turns back to me. \u201cThat\u2019s what it was. Not: \u2018Mr Jones, what are your political opinions?\u2019 Who cares?\u201d So wouldn\u2019t he have been curious to read about what Jones thought? \u201cThat assumes I was reading.\u201d</p> <p>Pratt jumps in. \u201cThey didn\u2019t market that kind of thing,\u201d he says. On the contrary, I tell him, whenever I research actors from the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s, they are invariably more forthcoming in their interviews. They offer opinions. They risk controversy. They don\u2019t always play it safe. He asks me why that is and I suggest to him that information spreads so quickly now, and in so many different directions, that self-censorship and rigid PR management are the only ways to exert control. \u201cYou\u2019re in the fortunate position of being able to research and take your time,\u201d Washington tells me. \u201cBut, with clickbait, it doesn\u2019t even need to be true. It just has to be first. \u2018Oh, it was all lies?

Even so, Washington and Pratt have managed not to deliver a single tangible opinion \u2013 unless you count their views on the risks of giving opinions. It\u2019s a tonic, then, to speak to Fuqua, who tells me that, yes, his version of The Magnificent Seven is unequivocally a portrait of the modern world. \u201cEverything\u2019s a little chaotic. We\u2019re a bit divided. We\u2019re fighting enemies we can\u2019t see and who don\u2019t play by our rules. There is tyranny. But the best part is we have a choice. In the film, we have black, white, Asian, Mexican, Native American, a white woman, all coming together to fight injustice.\u201d</p> <p>Fuqua has no issue with the movie being seen as an emblem of diversity. \u201cThere\u2019s a problem. We did something about it. And here\u2019s the beauty part: MGM and Sony backed it. No one said: \u2018A black man? A Native American?\u2019\u201d He is even happy for the villain to be regarded as a Trump surrogate. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t say not to. He represents that type. When I said tyranny, I meant raping the land, stealing people\u2019s money. I made the movie because I wanted to say that.\u201d I breathe an internal sigh of relief at his directness. That wasn\u2019t so hard, was it? Nothing like getting blood out of stones or opinions out of A-list actors.</p> <p>\u2022 The Magnificent Seven opens in the UK on 23 September.</p>",

  "<h2>OUTFOXED AND OUTFOUGHT</h2> <p>Musing about the afterlife towards the end of a popular movie directed by Martin McDonagh, Colin Farrell\u2019s character, Ray the hitman, wonders if hell might perhaps be \u201cthe entire rest of eternity spent in Bruges\u201d. While it\u2019s true that the Belgian city might be more popular as a weekend destination for couples who like to wander around looking at old stuff than a bolt-hole for hired guns with low boredom thresholds, it will always have a special place in the hearts of Leicester City fans. For them, it is the place where they played their first ever match in Big Cup, an occasion marked with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/14/club-brugge-leicester-city-champions-league-group-g-match-report\">an emphatic 3-0 win</a> in which Riyad Mahrez proved a far more capable hitman than Farrell by adding two goals to the opener scored by Marc Albrighton without causing any collateral damage to choirboys, drug-abusing dwarves, American tourists or couples who like to wander around looking at old stuff.</p> <p>\u201cMaybe the music woke him,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/14/claudio-ranieri-champions-league-riyad-mahrez-leicester\">trilled Claudio Ranieri</a> of a player whose performances so far this season had been well below the high standards he\u2019d set in winning last year\u2019s PFA Player of the Year award. \u201cMaybe he\u2019s tired of dilly-ding, dilly-dong and the [Big Cup] music woke him.

Much has been made of how difficult it would be for Spurs to play at Wembley, what with the pitch being slightly more rectangular than the one they\u2019re used to at White Hart Lane, the number of supporters on hand to cheer them on much greater and the pegs in the dressing room being that little bit more \u2026 \u201changy\u201d.

  "<p>It has been two months since I was brutally attacked along with more than 30 other individuals by armed soldiers at the Terrain compound in Juba, South Sudan.

But as I find my role transformed, I can\u2019t help but feel that this \u201cjustice\u201d we ask for is as elusive as ever.</p> <p>If the ongoing presidential investigation into the attack is thorough and soldiers are indeed found guilty of the crimes committed against us, there is a high chance they may be sentenced to death. Recently, two soldiers in Wau found guilty of committing murder and other crimes were <a href=\"http://www.sudantribune.com/spip.php?article59721\">executed by firing squad</a>.</p> <p>I can only speak about my own reaction to the events that followed the attack against us. I know very well that not everyone will agree with what I am about to say: but after two months of healing, I am wondering what \u201cjustice\u201d even looks like.</p> <p>In the decade since the 2003 UN Baghdad bombing, <a href=\"http://www.un.org/press/en/2014/sc11524.doc.htm\">aid worker casualties have tripled to more than 100 deaths per year</a>.

I am angry because I feel that the UN failed to do anything to protect us or to rescue us after the attack. I am angry at a nation that has a large armed force but no funds to pay them \u2013 soldiers that in many cases joined this army as children, trained and initiated into a life of destruction, fear and anger. I am angry at those soldiers who during the event clearly coerced younger troops, some who could not have been more than 16, to rape foreigners while they watched and cheered. The lives of those young soldiers have also been changed forever.</p> <p>Yes, I am angry. Yes, we need justice. But the death penalty does not give life to John Gatluak Manguet Nhial. Causing suffering in others does not alleviate my suffering. Instead, the death penalty only further erodes society\u2019s respect for the sanctity of life. It builds scar tissue to coarsen our culture, diminish our humanity.</p> <p>As a humanitarian, I moved to South Sudan to support a population that has endured war for generations. As humanitarians, we lived in South Sudan to use whatever skills we had to try and save lives.

But this discussion needs to happen before that call is made, before the trigger is pulled.</p> <p>We need to work towards better implementation of international humanitarian law and accountability for those who violate it. But these efforts must work hand in hand with the need to continue work to strengthen judicial systems and encourage governments to stop the use of capital punishment immediately.</p> <p>How can we call for justice when we know the consequences of that justice offend our moral code?</p> <p>South Sudan has continued to use the death penalty despite well-documented weaknesses in the country\u2019s legal system, which prevent it from ensuring the basic legal rights of people accused of crimes.

The study\u2019s co-author Dr David Keatley <a href=\"http://www.lincoln.ac.uk/news/2016/09/1266.asp\">said</a>: \u201cAnyone can be affected by what they see online, the social cues images can give and the popular conceptions of an \u2018ideal body image\u2019.\u201d </p> <p>The study goes further, linking gym attendance with feelings of inadequacy, rather than a desire to build muscle. \u201cWith the recent growth of selfies ... there\u2019s a real risk that males may be more influenced to attend the gym more regularly and work out to a point where it becomes dangerous or detracts from their wellbeing,\u201d Keatley continued.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-instagram\"> <blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" data-instgrm-captioned data-instgrm-version=\"7\" style=\" background:#FFF; border:0; border-radius:3px; box-shadow:0 0 1px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.5),0 1px 10px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.15); margin: 1px; max-width:658px; padding:0; width:99.375%; width:-webkit-calc(100% - 2px); width:calc(100% - 2px);\"><div style=\"padding:8px;\"> <div style=\" background:#F8F8F8; line-height:0; margin-top:40px; padding:62.4537037037% 0; text-align:center; width:100%;\"> <div style=\" background:url(data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAACwAAAAsCAMAAAApWqozAAAABGdBTUEAALGPC/xhBQAAAAFzUkdCAK7OHOkAAAAMUExURczMzPf399fX1+bm5mzY9AMAAADiSURBVDjLvZXbEsMgCES5/P8/t9FuRVCRmU73JWlzosgSIIZURCjo/ad+EQJJB4Hv8BFt+IDpQoCx1wjOSBFhh2XssxEIYn3ulI/6MNReE07UIWJEv8UEOWDS88LY97kqyTliJKKtuYBbruAyVh5wOHiXmpi5we58Ek028czwyuQdLKPG1Bkb4NnM+VeAnfHqn1k4+GPT6uGQcvu2h2OVuIf/gWUFyy8OWEpdyZSa3aVCqpVoVvzZZ2VTnn2wU8qzVjDDetO90GSy9mVLqtgYSy231MxrY6I2gGqjrTY0L8fxCxfCBbhWrsYYAAAAAElFTkSuQmCC); display:block; height:44px; margin:0 auto -44px; position:relative; top:-22px; width:44px;\"></div></div> <p style=\" margin:8px 0 0 0; padding:0 4px;\"> <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BBnBCIzR2ST/\" style=\" color:#000; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; line-height:17px; text-decoration:none; word-wrap:break-word;\" target=\"_blank\">California daze</a></p> <p style=\" color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px; margin-bottom:0; margin-top:8px; overflow:hidden; padding:8px 0 7px; text-align:center; text-overflow:ellipsis; white-space:nowrap;\">A photo posted by Sam Smith (@samsmithworld) on <time style=\" font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px;\" datetime=\"2016-02-10T14:47:03+00:00\">Feb 10, 2016 at 6:47am PST</time></p></div></blockquote> <script async defer src=\"//platform.instagram.com/en_US/embeds.js\"></script> </figure>  <p>But are selfies, celebs and Instagram wholly to blame for these masculinity transitions? In August, <a href=\"http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/09589236.2016.1217771\">Dr Jamie Hakim</a> theorised that this \u201cspornosexuals\u201d era (Mark Simpson\u2019s portmanteau of \u201csports star\u201d and \u201cporn star\u201d where men attend the gym to look \u201chench\u201d rather than healthy) was tied to the recession.

  "<p>Students and faculty members at Long Island University\u2019s Brooklyn campus will finally return to business as usual on Thursday after a historic 12-day lockout ended shortly after midnight.</p> <p>Over the last two weeks, around 400 LIU professors were locked out of their Brooklyn campus by university administration, with unqualified fill-in instructors making a farce of classes. A bitter labor dispute between university administrators and faculty members was at the root of it. <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Although it is over for now, the disquieting significance of what unfolded will live on.</p> <p>The lockout \u2013 thought to be the first of its kind in the US \u2013 not only signals a worrying turn for the value placed on professors as disposable commodities, but highlights the extra hurdles faced by working-class students of color as they seek to fight their way to the American dream.</p> <p>Nichia McFarlane is one of them. Just before she graduated high school, the now 24-year-old Brooklyn native ran away from what she calls a difficult home. She has been supporting herself ever since: after high school, she worked two jobs full-time, and simultaneously enrolled at Long Island University as a full-time student.</p> <p>At first, McFarlane says she was lost, and was tempted to drop out. But when she took an English course, things started to click. She says the professors she met at LIU changed her life.</p> <p>On Monday, two of her English professors embraced her in tears. Last Friday, McFarlane, who is only two semesters away from graduating, withdrew from the university.</p> <p>McFarlane says after the lockout was announced, and after she realized courses were not being taught by the qualified professors she had been looking forward to, students received emails from the administration saying their time to un-enroll without incurring a financial penalty had been shortened. She had to make a split-second decision that very day, and withdrew.</p> <p>\u201cAs they were locking out faculty, they were trying to lock in students. It felt like a con or a scam. I don\u2019t want to think that about the university that I am going to.\u201d</p> <p>Now that the lockout is over, McFarlane is not sure whether she will transfer, or re-enroll next semester. \u201cIt\u2019s not something I want to do any more,\u201d she said on Thursday morning about attending LIU. The dispute has left her with a bitter taste in her mouth.</p> <p>McFarlane has won essay awards within the LIU English department. Somewhat auspiciously, yet tragically, the last essay she gained academic star status for was one reflecting on the importance for women of color to empower themselves within higher education settings, despite often being barred from doing so based on societal norms.</p> <p>\u2022\u2022\u2022<br></p> <p>The lockout was orchestrated and led by LIU administration and its president, Kimberly Cline. Members of the Brooklyn faculty and LIU\u2019s administration had been in talks over a new contract, and as school was set to begin, they had not yet reached an agreement. With the lockout ended, contract negotiation (which is now involving a mediator) has been extended until May.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>\u201cEmployers have a right at certain points during collective bargaining to impose a lockout. It is a mirror image of employees\u2019 right to strike,\u201d explains Brishen Rogers, a professor of law at Temple University in Philadelphia.</p> <p>Rogers says one of the few other big symbolic lockouts in recent memory is Ronald Reagan\u2019s lockout. The firing of 11,000 air traffic controllers in 1981, which successfully broke unions, was widely seen as a watershed moment for the growth of neoliberalism.</p> <p>The comparison could well be telling. At the heart of this lockout lie bigger questions beyond faculty-administration relations. The lockout appears to be a symbol of the corporatization of American higher education as a whole \u2013 where professors are no longer treated with standalone value, but as disposable commodities.</p> <p>This is the case for Kathryn Krase, a 41-year-old associate professor of social work at the Brooklyn campus of New York\u2019s Long Island University. On 1 September, Krase became a tenured professor: an increasingly difficult feat in today\u2019s academic climate.</p> <p>Celebrations were painfully short-lived.</p> <p>At one second past midnight, on 3 September, with barely a day\u2019s notice to allow them to grab personal belongings and make any kind of arrangements, Krase and all 400 of her Brooklyn campus faculty colleagues were locked out of their own university by administration amid a labor dispute. Barred from setting foot on campus for the last two weeks, they have had no access to email, online coursework platforms, or student class lists. More concretely, from one day to the next, their salaries, benefits and healthcare were cut off. </p> <p>Whether or not they will be compensated for their 12 days of temporary redundancy has yet to be decided.</p> <p>\u2022\u2022\u2022</p> <p>Jacob Remes, a labor historian and a New York University professor, says that in the second part of the 20th century, education in the US slowly went from being seen as a sacred path towards creating American citizenship to being framed in a more instrumentalist way as a \u201cgood investment\u201d. The combination of this with high university tuition means that we now have a clear market approach to the entire sector.</p> <p>In the context of LIU, this means \u201cthat not only are professors seen as disposable, students are too\u201d, he says. \u201cThere is a broader trend of thinking of students as customers and as what the university does as selling degrees. Once you start doing that, it is very easy to see everyone as disposable, students too.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022\u2022\u2022</p> <p>Many on and off campus have started speculating that the treatment afforded the Brooklyn campus, a majority minority, low-income campus, would never have been afforded its suburban twin.</p> <p>\u201cOur school is largely a minority school, and many of us do not have financial means. This is part of why this is not moving fast enough. That, coupled with the fact that most of us are students of color. It seems like we are disposable, like we are just not that important,\u201d says McFarlane, the star English student.<br></p> <p>The lockout certainly seems to speak to the longstanding divide in the US between education standards for urban, lower-income, and more demographically diverse communities, and suburban, better-off, and whiter communities.</p> <p>LIU has two campuses, welcoming just under 10,000 students a year each. The Brooklyn campus, where the lockout of faculty took place, is a distinctly diverse place, where around eight out of 10 students identify as non-white. Many are first-generation college attendees, come from working-class, or immigrant backgrounds, and work full-time on top of attending classes full-time, says Srividhya Swaminathan, a professor of English at the university.</p> <p>The LIU Post campus is suburban, better off, and majority white (although, to be fair, not overwhelmingly so). The contrast between the two campuses is stark. While LIU Brooklyn is in the heart of bustling, densely populated Brooklyn, LIU Post is situated on the plush 300-acre estate of a cereal magnate, along an area of Long Island known for its opulence, sometimes named the Gold Coast. This area was most vividly brought to life in F Scott Fitzgerald\u2019s The Great Gatsby.</p> <p>\u201cThis is the kind of two-tier system that we see again and again in American life,\u201d says Rogers, the Temple law professor. \u201cWe have always seen a greater investment in public education, public infrastructure and services in whiter, wealthier areas.\u201d</p> <p>Ben Saunders, a professor of psychology at LIU Brooklyn, says that he feels the campus in Brooklyn is effectively funding the suburban Post campus, echoing critiques long made over the centuries by black public intellectuals: that communities of color are systematically plundered to support unrealistic standards of living for whiter communities.</p> <p>With students not receiving proper instruction in their first days back at school in Brooklyn, but still being required to fulfill exorbitant tuition demands, this certainly seems truer than ever.</p>",
  "<p>Residents of the world\u2019s largest refugee camp are technically being returned by force to conflict zones in a major contravention of international law, a rights group has argued.</p> <p>Since the Kenyan government <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/11/kenya-close-worlds-biggest-refugee-camp-dadaab\">announced in May that it will close the Dadaab camp</a> in eastern Kenya in November, many of the camp\u2019s roughly 300,000 residents have begun to leave for their original homes in war-torn Somalia.</p> <p>The Kenyan government and the management of the UN refugee agency, UNHCR, claim these returns are voluntary.

It\u2019s not the right time for us to go back. But every day the Kenyan government is telling us that we have to go, and UNHCR is not giving us any different information \u2026 I said I will go back as we have no other option.\u201d</p> <p>HRW argues that this dynamic is technically a breach of international law, since the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jul/07/un-refugee-convention-on-unlawful-entry-expulsion-and-refoulement-in-full\">1951 refugee convention</a> forbids the return or \u201crefoulement\u201d of refugees to countries where they may be at risk. </p> <p>HRW states: \u201cRefoulement occurs not only when a refugee is directly rejected or expelled, but also where indirect pressure on individuals is so intense that it leads them to believe that they have no practical option but to return to a country where they face serious risk of persecution or threats to their lives and safety.\u201d</p> <p>Bill Frelick, HRW\u2019s refugee rights director, said: \u201cThe Kenyan authorities are not giving Somali refugees a real choice between staying and leaving, and the UN refugee agency isn\u2019t giving people accurate information about security conditions in Somalia. There is no way these returns can be considered voluntary.\u201d</p> <p>In <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2016/may/25/kenya-william-ruto-tells-uk-to-resettle-somali-refugees-living-in-dadaab\">an interview with the Guardian</a> earlier this year, Kenya\u2019s vice-president, William Ruto, denied that refugees were being coerced into leaving. \u201cWe believe very strongly that there is a lot of willingness by the refugees to go back home,\u201d Ruto said. \u201cWe do not expect that it will get to a situation where anybody is forced to go back home, because that is not within our international obligations.\u201d</p> <p>The management of the UN refugee agency, which is meant to ensure the implementation of the 1951 refugee convention, says the returns are legal. \u201cWe have not seen [forced returns],\u201d a UNHCR spokesman <a href=\"http://www.nation.co.ke/news/UN-defends-Kenya-over-claim-forceful-repatriation-Dadaab/1056-3359452-883l8e/index.html\">said last month</a>.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/apr/17/dadaab-refugee-camp-closure-risk-350000-somali-lives-amnesty\">Dadaab refugee camp closure would endanger 350,000 Somali lives, warns Amnesty</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But in the field, UNHCR officials told a different story. \u201cFamilies we have interviewed and many of those who filled the repatriation forms have shown that they are returning because of threatening rhetoric by Kenyan regional security officials who recently visited the camp,\u201d a Dadaab-based UNHCR official, Mohamed Mahad Gurhan, <a href=\"http://www.nation.co.ke/news/UN-defends-Kenya-over-claim-forceful-repatriation-Dadaab/1056-3359452-883l8e/index.html\">told Voice of America</a>.</p> <p>Kenyan officials say their actions are inspired by Europe\u2019s attempts to keep Syrian refugees out of Europe by force. The initial decision to close Dadaab came just weeks after the announcement of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/mar/08/eu-turkey-refugee-deal-qa\">EU-Turkey deal</a>, which is meant to ensure the deportation of most asylum seekers arriving by boat to Greece.</p> <p>At the time, Kenya\u2019s cabinet secretary, Joseph Nkaissery, <a href=\"http://www.interior.go.ke/?p=3113\">said</a> of the Dadaab closure: \u201cThis is the standard practice worldwide. For example in Europe, rich, prosperous and democratic countries are turning away refugees from Syria, one of the worst war zones since world war two.\u201d</p> <p>The pattern is also being repeated in Pakistan, where <a href=\"http://www.hrw.org/news/2016/09/14/pakistan-coerced-refugee-return-endangers-thousands\">HRW says</a> the government is intimidating tens of thousands of Afghan refugees into returning home.</p> <p>Around 3 million Afghans have sought refuge in Pakistan, and roughly 90,000 have returned home this year after what HRW calls coercion on the part of the government.</p> <p>\u201cPakistani authorities are increasingly committing abuses against Afghan refugees that are triggering a mass refugee return,\u201d said Patricia Gossman, senior Afghanistan researcher at Human Rights Watch. \u201cThe government should rein in its abusive security forces and ensure the refugees\u2019 secure status and protection.\u201d</p>",

There\u2019s a scattering of arrangements and transcriptions, but the most substantial works here are <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSdrSeRbTqI\">Stevenson\u2019s Peter Grimes Fantasy</a>, a fantastical weaving of themes from Britten\u2019s opera; the Symphonic Elegy for Liszt, effectively a dark, extended barcarolle, and the gloriously extrovert Beltane Bonfire, composed as a competition test piece. That contains quotations from Chopin and Mozart, and allusions abound in Stevenson\u2019s music, just as his own musical language gathers in a range of composers from Liszt and Alkan onwards. Hamilton, who studied with the composer, brings exactly the right degree of control to the unstoppable streams of musical ideas, without ever compromising their energy or technical brilliance.<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2bcae2e4e8fa675bb0cf3ad14ab6f0faf39e21a5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2bcae2e4e8fa675bb0cf3ad14ab6f0faf39e21a5/133_259_1833_2440/751.jpg\" alt=\"Ronald Stevenson (1928-2015).\" width=\"751\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Composer Ronald Stevenson.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Chris Rice/Altarus Records</span> </figcaption> </figure>",

Both the NSA and GCHQ had direct access to the systems of Google, Facebook, Apple and other US internet companies in a program called <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/prism\" title=\"\">Prism</a> (though these companies have denied the backdoors). Documents show how GCHQ was tapping <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2013/jun/21/gchq-cables-secret-world-communications-nsa\" title=\"\">fibre-optic cables to intercept data</a> flowing through the global internet in a program called Tempora. They were surveilling world leaders, exploiting and hoarding software and hardware vulnerabilities in covert hacking operations, and intercepting phone data and \u201cnearly everything a user does on the internet\u201d. All without a clear democratic mandate.</p> <p>Martin is right that \u201chard data and hard, credible evidence has been scarce in cybersecurity thus far\u201d. However, we do have evidence of what security services get up to in secret, and it shows they cannot be trusted with power.</p>",
  "<p>There\u2019s a familiar shape lurking outside a side door at Pinewood Studios, tugging away on a cigarette. Leather jacket. Strap-on dreads. A bit older than you remember, but still very much the same rollie-smoking space waster. As one of the millions of kids who grew up with Red Dwarf \u2013 taped the episodes off the telly, made Bazookoids out of boxes \u2013 bumping into Dave Lister in a smoking area is more than a little surreal. \u201cYou want to be outside having a fag with eight Stormtroopers!\u201d says Craig Charles. Star Wars: Rogue One is filming on an adjacent lot. He launches into his giant, pepper-grinder laugh. \u201cNow THAT\u2019s surreal!\u201d </p> <p>We\u2019re here \u2013 in what, it turns out, is geek paradise \u2013 because filming on Red Dwarf series 11 and 12 is under way, a full 28 years after the smash cult sitcom began. Even taking into account its extended periods of hiatus, it\u2019s a pretty extraordinary lifespan for any show \u2013 never mind an odd, depressing-sounding sci-fi sitcom about the last human being left alive. </p> <p>When the show first aired in 1988, no one expected it to go anywhere. TV sci-fi was dead. (Late-80s Doctor Who saw to that.) The myth prevails that Red Dwarf only got the green light because money was set aside for a second series of the enthusiastically forgotten Ben Elton show Happy Families, which had the common decency not to be made. But according to Elton, it probably came from an unmade second series of his later sitcom Filthy Rich and Catflap. Nevertheless, all of a sudden there was some cash spare for a comedy about a man stranded 3m years into deep space with a hologram of his dead bunkmate, a creature who evolved from the ship\u2019s cat, and a senile computer named Holly.</p> <p>\u201cWhen the show took off there was no one overseeing it,\u201d says co-creator and writer Doug Naylor, \u201cso we could just do what we wanted.\u201d This meant, rather than established actors like Alan Rickman and Alfred Molina (both of whom auditioned), the roles of Lister went to Craig Charles, a zeitgeisty punk poet; his uptight superior Rimmer to amply nostrilled impressionist Chris Barrie; the computer\u2019s to laconic standup Norman Lovett, and the Cat\u2019s to a dancer named Danny John-Jules, who arrived to audition an hour late but in character, looking resplendent in one of his dad\u2019s zoot suits.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c3c1badafd0e0c42f8b88a9f4f00eb66c638e2f1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c3c1badafd0e0c42f8b88a9f4f00eb66c638e2f1/0_129_4827_2895/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018It\u2019s like Porridge \u2026 in space.\u2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018It\u2019s like Porridge \u2026 in space.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: UKTV</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Oddly, the show became a hit, enjoying a rude run of form between 1988 and 1993 and winning an Emmy in 1994. Something about it resonated: perhaps it was the exploration of some genuinely intriguing sci-fi ideas, from virtual reality to time travel; genetic engineering to the total absence of alien life. Perhaps it was its invented lexicon, replete with smegheads, goits and gimboids.</p> <p>Most likely, it was that, removed of all its sci-fi baubles, Red Dwarf was a classic, studio-based odd-couple sitcom. \u201cI always saw this as kind of Porridge in space,\u201d says Charles. It\u2019s no coincidence that the Marooned episode \u2013 consisting largely of Charles and Barrie, alone, bickering, trapped \u2013 is considered by many fans to be the best. \u201cRed Dwarf for me is about the chemistry of the main four,\u201d says Barrie. \u201cIf you look at Blackadder in its pomp, or Porridge, it\u2019s just a great marriage of performance and script. Red Dwarf has always had that.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"37c54ad785a30986cb15675d77451b6a2ac29bb4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/37c54ad785a30986cb15675d77451b6a2ac29bb4/0_253_5430_3258/1000.jpg\" alt=\"IT\u2019LL BLOW YOUR ARSE INTO SPACE! \u2026 back on board the Starbug.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">IT\u2019LL BLOW YOUR ARSE INTO SPACE! \u2026 back on board the Starbug.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: UKTV</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The show\u2019s momentum couldn\u2019t last: at the height of its popularity, Rob Grant (the other half of the writing and production duo) left. An uncertain seventh series in 1997 jettisoned the studio audience; a wobblier eighth in 1999 \u2013 which unwisely revived the entire crew of Red Dwarf \u2013 brought it back. After this, the BBC declined to renew it. That seemed to be that.</p> <p>\u201cThere was 12 years where I referred to Red Dwarf as \u2018that thing I used to do\u2019,\u201d says Robert Llewellyn, who joined in series three as uppity mechanoid Kryten. But the cast still loved the characters. The fan clubs were still around. Red Dwarf had lost none of its cultish buoyancy at conventions or in DVD sales. So, in 2009, Dave commissioned a three-episode special. Everyone returned. They did so again for a further full series in 2012. Both smashed Dave\u2019s ratings records. More Dwarf seemed inevitable, if the cast were game.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve known these guys longer than I\u2019ve known my wife,\u201d says Charles. \u201cThat was what it came down to \u2013 a choice between staying in Coronation Street or doing this.\u201d Last year, after 10 years on the cobbliest of soaps, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2015/sep/21/craig-charles-dark-side-interview\">Charles left</a>. He missed comedy, and the opportunity to strap on the famous dreads came up. \u201cI was like \u2018I\u2019ve got to do it.\u2019 It\u2019s a career-defining role.\u201d As it was with Llewellyn\u2019s re-application of the rubber head: \u201cThe only reason I do it now \u2013 and I don\u2019t do any other acting, it drives me mad \u2013 is because it\u2019s being with your mates for a few weeks.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s nothing similar about us,\u201d says John-Jules. \u201cExcept we all have Red Dwarf.\u201d</p> <p>The new series sees the return of filming before a live audience. A genuine camaraderie comes across during recording \u2013 one anyone who\u2019s seen out-takes compendium <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMoTBwjv1tU\">The Smeg-Ups</a> will recognise. \u201cIt would show if we were sick of each other,\u201d says Llewellyn. \u201cThere have been shitty times, certainly, but this season has been brilliant fun.\u201d There\u2019s gurning to camera. 25-year-old in-jokes. A lot of corpsing. The cast go and sit in the crowd during pre-recorded scenes. Llewellyn stays in character. Someone asks to lick Lister. \u201cAll the faffing, larking about between takes keeps the audience going,\u201d says Charles of the three-hour live taping. \u201cThough in SOME of the cast\u2019s cases,\u201d he snipes, side-eyeing John-Jules, \u201cit\u2019s because they can\u2019t remember a fuckin\u2019 thing.\u201d </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9abd421310215f9d38a5aef7df4c627be104143c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9abd421310215f9d38a5aef7df4c627be104143c/0_147_5235_3141/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018It used to be an \u201cH\u201d on the forehead \u2013 done.

The sets teem with fanboy detail: the Jupiter Mining Corporation-branded chilli sauce on Lister\u2019s shelf (tagline: \u201cIT\u2019LL BLOW YOUR ARSE INTO SPACE!\u201d); dog-eared copies of Morris Dancing Monthly on the coffee table; crushed JMC beer cans next to Lister\u2019s seat in Starbug; the photos of Jim Bexley Speed in his bunk. \u201cDid you have a look at the keyboards in the science room?\u201d asks Charles. \u201cWe\u2019ve messed around with the keys on one of them.

But few comedies reach the high-water mark of Red Dwarf\u2019s imperial phase to begin with, let alone maintain it for six series. Competing with itself, new Dwarf will always lose. 99% of sitcoms would. But there\u2019s still enough essence of Dwarf to satisfy fans, who \u2013 as the show approaches it fourth decade \u2013 it is aimed squarely at. \u201cThere\u2019s gonna be people out there who have their knives out for us,\u201d says Barrie. \u201cBut for the vast majority, the response will be really good.\u201d<br></p> <p>As to whether there\u2019ll be more, nothing\u2019s confirmed yet. \u201cIt\u2019s been the backbone of my career,\u201d says Barrie. \u201cI\u2019m happy to see it through to the end. As long as I\u2019m capable and required, I will say yes.\u201d Sounds promising \u2013 though they may need to spend a bit longer in the makeup chair for series 18. \u201cFor Chris it used to be an \u201cH\u201d on the forehead \u2013 done,\u201d says Llewellyn. \u201cNow he needs a bit more help in the ... hair department.\u201d He turns the Bazookoid on himself. \u201cSix days after we finish shooting I turn 60,\u201d he says. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s right for a 60-year-old man to be covered in rubber. I\u2019ve been very much cured of any temptation towards a rubber fetish.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d says Barrie, \u201cbut he\u2019s already been a man of 59 doing it. He\u2019ll be there. I know he will.\u201d Llewellyn adds, mock-appalled: \u201cBut don\u2019t forget, Craig\u2019s busy DJing for young people.\u201d</p> <p><em>Red Dwarf XI starts on 22 September at 9pm on Dave.

  "<p>In recent years, Justin Timberlake\u2019s been forcefully trying to sell to the world that he can act. For a superstar of his stature, he\u2019s done just fine at picking the right roles to showcase his good looks and undeniable charisma, most notably putting both to good use as Sean Parker in The Social Network. But as Jonathan Demme\u2019s concert documentary Justin Timberlake + the Tennessee Kids indisputably shows, Timberlake is only truly in his element when on stage being a showman. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2016/jul/01/justin-timberlake-uses-black-culture-says-hip-hop-star-vic-mensa\">Justin Timberlake 'uses black culture', says hip-hop star Vic Mensa</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Filmed over the final few nights of Timberlake\u2019s 20/20 Experience tour in Las Vegas, Demme\u2019s film doesn\u2019t purport to be the megastar\u2019s answer to Madonna: Truth or Dare, the Material Girl\u2019s seminal documentary that blended footage from her Blond Ambition tour with a candid delve into her whirlwind life.</p> <p>Demme gets his behind-the-scenes bits swiftly out of the way, introducing us to Timberlake\u2019s bandmates, managers and dancers. The singer silently takes in the cavernous MGM Grand arena and relaxes in his backstage suite. Ready to go on, Timberlake appears completely unfazed, high-fiving his crew as he passes them by on the way to take his position. Then, before you know it, he\u2019s onstage getting the party started.</p> <p>Only during the end credits does Demme return backstage, to show the herculean task of transforming the venue into Timberlake\u2019s playground. For the rest of Justin Timberlake + the Tennessee Kids, Demme keeps the focus solely on the concert. Luckily, the man of the hour puts on a great spectacle.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_LQoM8hJS6c\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/_LQoM8hJS6c?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>Even if Timberlake\u2019s brand of funky pop is not to your liking, he proves himself to be such a forceful and gifted entertainer, that resistance is ultimately futile. His falsetto is on-point throughout, as are his smooth moves \u2013 like a blend of Frank Sinatra, Michael Jackson and Prince, to whom the film is dedicated. There\u2019s a sexy swagger to Timberlake\u2019s onstage personae that never reads as cocksure, largely because of the lavish attention he pays to his band and dancers. <br></p> <p>As the title of Demme\u2019s documentary suggests, Justin Timberlake + the Tennessee Kids is inclusive, showcasing the talents of the 25 or so performers sharing the stage with the main act. They all look like there\u2019s no place they\u2019d rather be, despite it being the end of a grueling two year tour. In an era when machines are largely responsible for the beats that drive pop music, the reverence Timberlake shows for actual instruments is worth endearing. </p> <p>Still, there\u2019s no mistaking Timberlake as ring leader. He works hard for the title, sweating his way through the numbers, mostly culled from his hit 2006 album FutureSex/LoveSounds, leaving his set only once, to change from his tight Tom Ford tuxedo into something more casual. On top of singing and dancing, he plays both the piano and the guitar. But his most impressive feat: not once is he seen swigging water. The only liquid he consumes, under Demme\u2019s watch, is a shot of tequila, offered to him by his frequent producer Timbaland, who\u2019s planted in the audience pit.</p> <p>Timberlake is altogether God-like, as presented in the Netflix film, with Demme oftentimes shooting him from underneath, like a commoner gazing up at an idol. It\u2019s a hell of a view.</p> <ul> <li>Justin Timberlake + the Tennessee Kids arrives on Netflix 12 October.<br></li> </ul>",

There is no overall trend to say that grammar schools are better for the country\u2019s education, let alone social mobility. I knew plenty of millennials who have not \u2018succeeded\u2019 from grammar school, and the largely academic curriculum was also not helpful in equipping them with the knowledge and tools for working in trades.

Mrs May\u2019s assumption is that bright kids can do it, no matter what sort of home they are brought up in.

  "<p>EU leaders will search for unity at a special summit without the UK on Friday, in the hope of setting a course for a union battered by the Brexit vote and riven by a simmering east-west row over migration. </p> <p>Donald Tusk, the former Polish prime minister who chairs EU leaders\u2019 summits, hopes to cool tempers after Luxembourg\u2019s foreign minister called for Hungary to be <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/13/expel-hungary-from-eu-for-hostility-to-refugees-says-luxembourg\">thrown out of the EU</a> for allegedly treating asylum seekers \u201cworse than wild animals\u201d.

Officials are playing down expectations of results from the meeting at Bratislava castle, in the capital of Slovakia, one of the four Visegr\u00e1d countries along with Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic. <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Officials close to Tusk hope for small but symbolic breakthroughs, most notably an agreement to send an extra 200 border guards and 50 vehicles to the EU\u2019s external frontier in Bulgaria by next month.</p> <p>Agreeing on stronger border defences is the easy bit. The thorny issue of sharing the cost of protecting refugees is likely to continue to strain unity. The Visegr\u00e1d group are fiercely opposed to the EU executive\u2019s attempts to <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/03/eu-refugee-crisis-closed-door-countries-pay-solidarity-contributions\">fine them for not accepting refugees</a> in their countries.

In his annual <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/14/juncker-european-unity-brexit-vote-eu\">state of the union address,</a> he said solidarity \u201cmust come from the heart\u201d and could not be forced. One EU source said it was too early to say what this meant for the policy, describing it as \u201ca semi-step back by the commission that might be a useful way out\u201d. Another EU official said the dispute was \u201ca cancer we have to cure\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"55b8878ec88e282760eb375af576780240fb76a3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/55b8878ec88e282760eb375af576780240fb76a3/0_0_3097_1858/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Donald Tusk\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Donald Tusk, the president of the European council, hopes for small but symbolic breakthroughs.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kirsty Wigglesworth/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In the citadel that towers over the Danube, Tusk will brief leaders on his recent <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/08/donald-tusk-theresa-may-article-50-brexit-negotiations-eu\">meeting with the British prime minister</a>, Theresa May, although officials say there is little to report.

The European ideology that you find in Brussels, Paris and Berlin, you won\u2019t find in Bratislava, in Budapest.\u201d</p> <p>Orb\u00e1n, and Jaros\u0142aw Kaczy\u0144ski, the leader of Poland\u2019s ruling Law and Justice party and an influential Eurosceptic, were outliers, he said.</p> <p>\u201cThe Czech Republic tries very hard to have a good relationship with Berlin and are trying to distance themselves from the other three. The Slovak government, which has the presidency, is trying to be part of the mainstream,\u201d he said.</p> <p>When Slovakia\u2019s prime minister, Robert Fico, stands alongside Tusk to discuss the results of the summit on Friday evening, that view will be put to the test.</p>",
  "<p>By the time the deal was done, after a summer of vaunted arrivals and improbable returns, Chelsea\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/aug/31/david-luiz-shock-return-chelsea-34m-transfer-psg\" title=\"\">deadline-day signing of David Luiz</a> didn\u2019t feel like that big a deal. He was a deadline\u2011day headline, an intriguing subplot bringing light relief to the fraught soap opera of this season\u2019s Premier League. Yet, really, even in the context of Chelsea\u2019s habit of revisiting former beaux, the second coming of David Luiz is remarkable.</p> <p>This, after all, is a player who was sold with hoots of disbelieving laughter for a fee <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/may/24/david-luiz-paris-psg-50m-fee-chelsea\" title=\"\">rising to a possible \u00a350m in 2014</a>, becoming the most expensive defender in the world \u2013 a record he still holds. How had Chelsea got so much? And what were Paris Saint-Germain doing signing a player whose greatest asset is arguably that he is instantly recognisable in silhouette? And then two years later, Chelsea decided they would spend 60% of that fee to get him back; that rather than looking to the future, rather than seeking a young talent they could craft to one day form an enduring partnership with Kurt Zouma, they would bring in the familiar, gaffe-prone devil they knew.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/15/cecs-fabregas-part-of-chelsea-plans-antonio-conte\">Cesc F\u00e0bregas remains part of my Chelsea plans, insists Antonio Conte</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Could he perhaps play at the back of midfield? Yes. Does his arrival open the possibility of playing with a back three? Yes. But <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/13/david-luiz-chelsea-return-liverpool-john-terry-injury\" title=\"\">with John Terry injured</a>, Antonio Conte has said David Luiz will make his second Chelsea debut on Friday against a Liverpool side who, when they are rampant, are very rampant, having already put four past last season\u2019s top two. Send in the clowns! <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2011/nov/20/chelsea-liverpool-andre-villas-boas\" title=\"\">Fire up the PlayStation!</a> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1tmMe1WBnc\" title=\"\">Scatter the pratfall rakes!</a></p> <p>Yet perhaps the mockery isn\u2019t entirely fair. That Chelsea have gone back to David Luiz says much about the dearth of genuinely high-class central defenders. David Luiz is capable of immense performances. There are times when he becomes a leader, dominating games almost by force of personality alone. He was superb <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2012/may/19/bayern-munich-chelsea-champions-league-final\" title=\"\">in the 2012 Champions League final</a>, an inspirational presence who radiated authority, despite having Jos\u00e9 Bosingwa to his right, that flank otherwise protected by Salomon Kalou. David Luiz took Chelsea\u2019s second kick in the shootout that night, after Juan Mata had missed. He scored with such an emphatic sense of purpose that the mood in the stadium almost palpably changed: he restored Chelsea\u2019s confidence with that kick and in so doing planted doubt in Bayern heads.</p> <p>Chelsea have been on the receiving end of that as well. Two seasons ago, after PSG had Zlatan Ibrahimovic sent off at Stamford Bridge, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/mar/11/chelsea-psg-champions-league-match-report\" title=\"\">it was David Luiz round whom PSG rallied</a>. He was the giant dragging them to belief. After Gary Cahill seemed to have won the tie, it was he who found the equaliser to take the game into extra time.</p> <p>But that virtue, that capacity to command the spirits of his team-mates, is not readily tameable. There are times when he seems too passionate, most notably in the World Cup semi-final. He wasn\u2019t the only Brazilian blubbing and beating his chest at the national anthem, but he was the one who held up Neymar\u2019s shirt in bizarre oblation to the absent star when injury ruled him out in Belo Horizonte. He was the greatest cauldron of patriotic fervour and it was he who boiled over most spectacularly, drawn repeatedly out of the backline as Germany <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/jul/08/germany-brazil-world-cup-semi-final-match-report\" title=\"\">sliced through Brazil again and again</a>.</p> <p>That was an extreme case but it was part of a general trend. David Luiz is not reliable. He is not disciplined. There are times when he tries to do too much. If Franco Baresi was the Apollo of defenders, cold, rational and calculating, David Luiz is the Dionysus, wild, charismatic and emotional. His heart can inspire him and those around him but it can lead him into places he probably shouldn\u2019t go.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cdce6e77491a88c34e26e8471d1e56cc10d6784e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cdce6e77491a88c34e26e8471d1e56cc10d6784e/0_53_3579_2148/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018If Franco Baresi was the Apollo of defenders, cold, rational and calculating, David Luiz is the Dionysius, wild, charismatic and emotional.\u2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018If Franco Baresi was the Apollo of defenders, cold, rational and calculating, David Luiz is the Dionysius, wild, charismatic and emotional.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: CameraSport via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There is a place for that even in modern football. Alongside a controlling presence, somebody who can harness his urges, David Luiz can be highly effective. Thiago Silva just about kept him in check at the World Cup; it was when he was suspended that David Luiz became self-destructively overenthusiastic.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/14/jurgen-klopp-liverpool-face-world-class-talent-diego-costa\">J\u00fcrgen Klopp says Liverpool will not target \u2018world-class\u2019 Diego Costa</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Sometimes there is need for that sort of galvanic personality. Whether that is Chelsea here and now is another issue. Somebody such as David Luiz requires the team to be built if not around him, then at least with a clear idea of his strengths and weaknesses. Yet Conte as good as admitted he signed David Luiz because his preferred targets at centre\u2011back were unavailable and the Brazilian came into reach on the final day of the transfer window.</p> <p>As Conte said, David Luiz has \u201cgreat personality, good technique, likes to play\u201d. He can play a much higher line than Terry if Conte wishes to impose a more extreme version of his pressing game. He does appear to be \u201ca good guy, a positive guy for the changing room\u201d. That he has \u201cgreat commitment and attitude\u201d seems a given, but for Conte to say he has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/09/chelsea-antonio-conte-david-luiz-best-defenders\" title=\"\">\u201cgood technique, good personality like Leonardo Bonucci </a>and he likes to play football.

  "<p>Perhaps everyone who read comments from the Czech president, Milo\u0161 Zeman, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/14/milos-zeman-czech-leader-refugees\" title=\"\">published in the Guardian yesterday</a>, concluded that the chain-smoking 71-year-old is an exceptionally distasteful man. His objection to accepting Muslim refugees, and urging Czechs to arm themselves against a possible \u201csuper-Holocaust\u201d, is not even the worst example of the president\u2019s obtuseness.</p> <p>A few examples. On the International Students\u2019 Day on 17 November, which commemorates the closing of Czech universities by the Nazis in 1939, Zeman shared a platform with a Czech far-right party. And of the Czech Friends of the Earth, award-winning nature conservationists trying to protect a national park from illegal logging, he said he would treat them in a \u201cgood old medieval way: burn them, piss on them and salt them\u201d. He really does make Nigel Farage look like a nice guy.</p> <p>While comparison to the British far-right populist holds well in many respects, there is a larger question to answer. Why on earth would a nation \u2013 represented on the dawn of its freedom 25 years ago by the universally popular figure of V\u00e1clav Havel \u2013 elect as its president such a moron?</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We have to face the harsh reality: European post-communist countries have failed to build a decent type of democracy</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>To find a correct answer we have to recognise that Zeman is alone neither in the Czech Republic nor in the region of the post-communist EU member states. Rather, he is a vulgar version of the populists who have emerged across the region as its new political leadership. Think of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/apr/11/lech-kaczynski-obituary\" title=\"\">Poland\u2019s Jaros\u0142aw Kaczy\u0144ski</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/26/hungarian-prime-minister-viktor-orban-praises-donald-trump\" title=\"\">Viktor Orb\u00e1n in Hungary</a> or <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2016/06/21/the-next-e-u-president-says-islam-has-no-place-in-his-country/\" title=\"\">Robert Fico in Slovakia</a>. In the Czech Republic, we also have the dangerous oligarch, media and agro-business tycoon and minister of finance, <a href=\"http://www.economist.com/blogs/easternapproaches/2013/11/czech-politics\" title=\"\">Andrej Babi\u0161</a>.</p> <p>With their authoritarian style and fanning of hatred towards minorities and refugees, they all stand as evidence to the story of the failed transformations of the post-communist countries. We have to face the harsh reality: the central European post-communist countries have failed to build a decent type of democracy, and most of them are in acute danger of slipping into authoritarian regimes.</p> <p>People by and large do not feel represented by the political parties. This is often explained by the fact that substantial parts of the leadership of post-communist political parties have participated in institutionalised corruption. But perhaps even more important is the fact that all of the parties have advocated the neoliberal capitalism most people have come to see as a political and economic system that makes their lives worse.</p> <p>In central Europe, you could even conclude that neoliberal capitalism has encouraged corruption by declaring that everything should have its price tag. If \u201ceverything\u201d, why not state decisions? Why not university degrees or public offices? It has been proved that all of those assets have been the subject of murky trades in the Czech Republic\u2019s recent past.</p> <p>Only when we realise this can we explain Czech society\u2019s deep disgust with post-communist politics, and the opportunities for the strong populist figures who pretend they will defend society against whatever may come.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/14/milos-zeman-czech-leader-refugees\">Milo\u0161 Zeman: the hardline Czech leader fanning hostility to refugees</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But this crisis of political representation is not confined to the east. It partly explains Brexit, the emergence of movements such as Podemos or Syriza, and Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s transformation of Labour. The left movement in eastern Europe was totally demolished by communism, and all attempts to establish progressive social movements are still struggling with that stigma.</p> <p>Thus the new wave of central European populism comes with rightwing methods of escalating hatred; even if, as in the case of Zeman and Fico, they claim to have a leftist background. The situation should be worrying for all of the Europe. Central Europe is on the way to become once again a chaotic place of mutually competing nationalisms and geopolitical struggles. If this dystopian future for the region is to be averted, it would require a broad-minded EU strategy to fix and deepen the democracies in the region.</p> <p>While \u201cbroad-minded EU strategy\u201d might sound like an oxymoron to many, the situation is too serious for the EU not to even attempt it. Is it possible? Or can we Czechs manage to defeat hateful populism ourselves? While there are many who will not stop trying, it is only fair to accept the situation is even worse than it was immediately after the fall of communism, when the future looked so bright and promising.</p>",
  "<p>On it goes.The Russian cyber-espionage group Fancy Bears had promised to publish more confidential records of more athletes, obtained by hacking into the World Anti-Doping Agency\u2019s databases. And last night they were good to their word, posting the confidential medical records of over a dozen more top athletes, including the British cyclists Bradley Wiggins and Chris Froome, showing the banned substances for which they had received a therapeutic use exemption (TUE). It followed the first leak of information detailing the TUEs Serena and Venus Williams and the gymnast Simone Biles had received. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/sep/15/chris-froome-defends-use-tues-wada-hacking-leaks\">Wiggins and Froome have defended their use</a> of TUEs, while the Williams sisters\u2019 and Biles\u2019 insistence that they had done nothing wrong has been staunchly backed by Wada and the tennis and gymnastics authorities.</p> <p>Nonetheless, on social media questions about whether there is more here than meets the eye have been winging their way round the carousel. Some have doubted whether Serena Williams needed to take powerful medication such as prednisolone, methylprednisolone, hydromorphone, oxycodone and prednisone, for instance, while others have asked what the Fancy Bears data says about TUE use and how widespread it may be.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/sep/15/chris-froome-defends-use-tues-wada-hacking-leaks\">Chris Froome defends use of TUEs as Team GB athletes warned of data leaks</a> </p> </aside>  <p>When it comes to the Williams sisters, however, one of the world\u2019s top anti-doping experts tells the Guardian that the Fancy Bears data suggests no indication of wrongdoing. \u201cThe first thing that struck me was that nothing struck me,\u201d says Richard Ings, who as a former president of the Australian Anti\u2011Doping Agency and senior executive of the ATP tennis tour is better qualified than most to judge. \u201cSerena, for instance, had exactly the sort of medication \u2013 often for very short periods \u2013 you would expect for soft tissue injuries and was granted approval.\u201d</p> <p>But can we trust the process? In tennis, at least, Ings believes we can. \u201cThere is no doubt that TUEs can be abused,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s like any other aspect of anti-doping. You have anti\u2011doping agencies that tip off athletes before testing and you have anti-doping agencies that have TUE policies that are flexible at best. But tennis has an independent medical review board, which involves three doctors reviewing each TUE request from a player\u2019s physician and \u2013 where appropriate \u2013 granting their usage with strict limitations.\u201d</p> <p>The Williams sisters and Biles aside, the wider question of whether widespread TUE usage is appropriate is one that is increasingly debated within anti-doping and sports science circles. The respected sports scientist Ross Tucker, for instance, believes that what started out as a legitimate practice \u2013 the idea that athletes with asthma, say, getting TUEs so they could negate the disadvantages they faced \u2013 has been corrupted. \u201cI would consider banning all TUEs in competition,\u201d Tucker tells the Guardian. \u201cI know it is a hard-line stance. But what would be the downside if people with asthma cannot compete? Conceptually to me, that is fine. Because unfortunately the efforts to be inclusive with people who have valid medical issues have created a loophole that is being exploited by sophisticated dopers.\u201d</p> <p>Tucker points to the high use of corticosteroids, which are given to athletes to help them breath better yet can also be performance-enhancing. \u201cIf they were banned, unfortunately you would end up discriminating against people with asthma,\u201d he says, \u201cbut, if you define asthma as a breathing disorder which prevents you from accessing your maximum capacity, you could argue that EPO should be legal because people don\u2019t have high blood values too.\u201d</p> <p>Then there is the rumoured widespread use of cortisone, especially in cycling, to reduce weight while maintaining power, something Tucker calls the \u201choly grail\u201d in the sport. \u201cIt\u2019s an anti-inflammatory but it works because it negates the inflammatory pain that you normally get when you exercise and so there is no signal to back off.\u201d He points out a further worrying issue with TUEs: in the past some athletes, such as Lance Armstrong, have been allowed TUEs retrospectively to escape possible bans, as the American did after testing positive for corticosteroids in 1999.</p> <p>Some, like the triathlete Jodie Swallow, have called for all TUEs to be made public. Yet that raises privacy concerns. \u201cIf you have a female athlete going through IVF \u2013 why should the world know such a private issue,\u201d one figure in anti-doping told the Guardian.</p> <p>Ings concurs. \u201cI know of athletes with hepatitis who are taking low doses of steroids to help control it and even athletes with cancers,\u201d he says. \u201cAll sorts of things you don\u2019t want on a front page of a Russian website.\u201d</p> <p>Ings believes the Fancy Bears hack is \u201can extension of a political beat-up from disgruntled people in Russia\u201d which is clearly targeting Wada. \u201cIt\u2019s trying to draw the conclusion that Wada is complicit in allowing athletes to dope to deflect from the fact that Russia was complicit in allowing athletes to dope,\u201d he says. \u201cThis is not about corruption in Wada. It is about compliance and competency. I don\u2019t think Wada has anywhere near the bandwidth to review all these TUEs and to make sure they are being applied properly.\u201d</p> <p>He calls for much more public information by sport and country about which and how many TUEs were received, approved, dismissed \u2013 and a proper compliance framework to audit the system. Tucker, who is a stronger critic of the status quo, concurs. \u201cPeople who have asthma are told to start swimming, because it forces them to breathe in a controlled way and it helps symptoms, so the fact so many swimmers have asthma is not an indication of something dodgy and nefarious,\u201d he says, \u201cbut we don\u2019t know because there is no baseline data.</p> <p>\u201cImagine if we knew how many swimmers are asthmatic by country? Or, say, endurance runners? Or which training groups were all on it? It would help us understand whether the use of TUEs is getting out of hand.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/sep/13/wada-russian-cyber-attack-espionage-group\">Wada cyber attack: Williams sisters and Simone Biles targeted by Russian group</a> </p> </aside>",
  "<h2>Negotiating the crooked line</h2> <p>To see or not to see. That is the question after the opening two rounds of the new Premiership season when the emphasis seems to be on increasing the time the ball is in play by ignoring certain law infractions. Crooked feeds into the scrum have long been connived at, but now forward passes are being tolerated and not straight in the lineout has become a relative concept.</p> <p>Not too unstraight, it seems now. Which sort of makes sense given the determination to unclot matches from numerous scrum resets: why blow for a throw that, while not straight down the middle of a lineout, is not veering towards the thrower\u2019s scrum-half and swap that set piece for a potentially troublesome scrum?</p> <p>Get the ball out and away seems to be the mantra and, added to the drift towards making it harder for defending teams to contest at the breakdown, rugby union is becoming less a contest for possession and more one of what sides do with the ball. Some are adapting more slowly than others: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/sep/10/wallabies-play-with-energy-and-substance-to-defeat-springboks\" title=\"\">Last Saturday, South Africa</a> persisted in kicking to Australia\u2019s full-back, Israel Folau, not a smart tactic in itself, rather than trusting themselves to sustain an attack.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2016/sep/13/new-zealand-warren-gatland-british-irish-lions-saracens\">New Zealand and Saracens have taken rugby to new levels of excellence | Robert Kitson</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It is a legacy of the days when teams considered it to be dangerous to be in possession in certain areas of the field, that is within range of the opposition goal-kicker. Wales have for years made conquest of the skies a key part of their gameplan and in Dan Biggar have one of the best retrievers around, but with officials now seeming to favour the attacking side it is becoming more of a risk to give possession away.</p> <p>One consequence is that there will be more inconsistency. When Leicester played Gloucester at Kingsholm <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/sep/02/gloucester-leicester-premiership-match-report\" title=\"\">on the opening night of the Premiership season</a>, they were awarded a try after JP Pietersen had appeared to throw the ball forward after being tackled. There was no review, but later, when Adam Thompstone chased a kick ahead and had a claim for a penalty try after being impeded as the ball bounced over the Gloucester tryline, he was ruled on review to have been in front of the kicker.</p> <p>Which he was, if marginally, but certainly less in front than Pietersen\u2019s pass was of its target, Manu Tuilagi. Who is deciding which rule breaches to see and which not to? Not referees, now professional at the top level and obliged to act on directives \u2013 speeding up matches is the latest one \u2013 but because they remain employed by unions, rather than World Rugby, they remain subject to the whims of their employers with countries having differing priorities. There is no move to have the world\u2019s leading officials employed by the game\u2019s governing body, even though it would aid consistency by removing them from the conflicting demands of their unions when it comes to which laws to focus on, although the idea has been discussed in the past.</p> <p>The law on a forward pass is clear: \u201cA throw forward occurs when a player throws or passes the ball forward, ie if the arms of the player passing the ball move towards the opposing team\u2019s dead ball line.\u201d The definition was changed three years ago having read: \u201cA throw forward occurs when a player throws or passes the ball forward. \u2018Forward\u2019 means towards the opposing team\u2019s dead ball line.\u201d</p> <p>So it is now not about whether a pass is forward, but the direction in which a player\u2019s arms are pointing. If a player perfects a throw like an American Football quarterback in a clear backward movement and manages to manoeuvre the ball out of the side of his or her throwing arm so that it clearly travels forward, there is no breach of the regulation itself, only its spirit.</p> <p>When World Rugby announced last year the current experimental law variations, which are being trialled throughout the world in club and international tournaments, it stated that the laws must allow for a fair contest for possession, especially \u201cin the contact area, in general play and when play is restarted at scrums, lineouts and kick-offs\u201d.</p> <p>It is not quite working out that way. Even Sam Warburton, renowned turnover specialist, is finding it hard to steal possession at the breakdown since players were stopped from putting their arms on the ground beyond the ball . As fetchers struggle to adapt, England have shown that operating without a specialist openside is not the handicap it would have been even a year ago.</p> <p>Before the start of the season, Exeter\u2019s head coach, Rob Baxter, said he was concerned that attempts to speed up the game and demystify some of its more arcane elements as it sought a new audience in countries such the United States, China and continental Europe, would make it <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/27/rob-baxter-exeter-new-premiership-season\" title=\"\">less a sport for all shapes and sizes and more one modelled on rugby league</a>, all action and athleticism with no room for specialisation.</p> <p>One of the current law trials discourages players from putting a foot into touch before catching the ball or planting it over the dead ball line before dabbing it down, because the reward will no longer be a lineout on the line the ball was kicked from or a scrum. In the first instance, the player will be considered to have put a foot in touch and in the second a drop-out will be awarded.</p> <p>If it is currently hard on kickers who have not made an egregious mistake, it is another move in favour of the team in possession. That said, the six-point try is unlike to pass into law because in the trials it has spawned even more kicks to touch and driving mauls, which remain difficult to defend legally. If player welfare lies at the heart of any permanent changes to the laws before the next World Cup, the contest for possession and the value of rugby union\u2019s staples, such as the set-pieces, should not be far behind.

Vigil points out the same thing happened during her time as a US senator for New York, when it was mainly local press focusing on her work.<br></p> <p>No one is asking Clinton about napkins these days, but that doesn\u2019t mean the sexism has gone. \u201cWithin the beltway press, the sexism has become more nuanced condescension,\u201d Boehlert said. </p> <p>Presidents have also had much more serious health crises far before Clinton came down with a bout of pneumonia. Franklin D Roosevelt wore leg braces and could barely walk when he accepted the Democratic nomination in 1932, before becoming entirely paralyzed. John F Kennedy had Addison\u2019s disease. Both health issues were rarely covered in the media.<br></p> <p>\u201cYet Hillary Clinton had pneumonia, didn\u2019t share it for two days and it was the biggest crime of the century.

  "<p>You remember that time a children\u2019s TV presenter, one who has been working in children\u2019s television <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Jarvis_(presenter)#CBeebies\">for decades</a> and is now employed on <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/cbeebies/shows/show-me-show-me\">a channel aimed at under-8-year-olds</a>, decided to risk it all and say one of the worst possible swear words on a <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/cbeebies/shows/show-me-show-me\">show for pre-schoolers</a> that he is <a href=\"http://www.chrisandpui.com/\">famous for co-hosting</a>? Remember how he took a huge risk for no appreciable gain and uttered a context-free profanity to an audience of toddlers? How he must have wanted to swear on children\u2019s TV but paradoxically didn\u2019t want anyone to notice so \u201csnuck it in\u201d as part of a song, where it would be more ambiguous? How all the editors and regulators at the BBC happened to completely miss it and allow it to be aired?</p> <p>Remember this happening? Well you shouldn\u2019t, because it clearly didn\u2019t. No presenter and/or channel would risk their whole livelihood in such a pointless, meaningless way, especially not the ever-pressured BBC. And, yet, an alarming number of people <a href=\"http://www.mirror.co.uk/tv/tv-news/youre-fluttering-c-mothers-shock-8789810\">do think it happened</a>. Apparently, there have been some \u201coutraged parents\u201d who are aghast at the whole thing. </p> <p>This seems reasonable in some respects; if your toddler was subjected to extreme cursing then as a parent you probably would object. On the other hand, if your very small child is able to recognise strong expletives, then perhaps misheard lyrics on cheerful TV shows aren\u2019t the most pressing issue in their life. </p> <p>Regardless, a surprising number of people report that they did genuinely \u201chear\u201d the c-word. This is less likely to be due to a TV presenter having some sort of extremely-fleeting breakdown, and more likely due to the quirks and questionable processing of our senses by our powerful yet imperfect brains. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bb67ac8b2944d97c77f82b789352d6407070a6da\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bb67ac8b2944d97c77f82b789352d6407070a6da/0_369_5537_3323/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A visitor peers into US artist John Baldessari\u2019s \u201cBeethoven\u2019s Trumpet (With Ear) Opus # 133\u201d at the Art Basel fair in Hong Kong\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">What goes into your ears isn\u2019t always the same as what you hear.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Anthony Wallace/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The vast majority of people will be able to recall at least one time when they misheard a song lyric, thinking the artist was saying something entirely different. I still hear \u201cI can see clearly now Lorraine has gone\u201d when listening to the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FscIgtDJFXg\">classic John Nash song</a>. I assumed Lorraine was an ex of Nash\u2019s who caused him much turmoil and confusion. These misheard lyrics or <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mondegreen\">\u201cmondegreens\u201d</a> are very common, often leading to humorous discussions. But why do they happen? </p> <p>Part of it is due to the way the brain works. One argument is, rather than constantly having to work what\u2019s going on second by second based on sensory information, the brain <a href=\"http://hfs.sagepub.com/content/31/6/617.short\">creates mental models of how the world works</a>, based on memory and experiences. This frees up a lot of time and resources, but it does result in our perception being influenced by what we <em>expect</em>, rather than what we do experience. Notice how people gravitate to things they already believe/agree with via <a href=\"https://www.sciencedaily.com/terms/confirmation_bias.htm\">confirmation bias</a>; there\u2019s usually nothing specific to make one argument or observation stand out amongst countless others, but it\u2019s one we already have in our mental model, so we focus on that one (eg you believe the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/brain-flapping/2012/dec/13/moon-landings-faked-science-confessions\">moon landings were faked</a>, so you ignore all the official evidence but focus on one poorly-spelled blogpost which supports this view). </p> <p>You can also find many demonstrations of how our ears, as well as other sensory apparatus, mislead or confuse us often. Check out <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzo45hWXRWU\">auditory illusions</a>, the sound equivalent of optical illusions like the <a href=\"http://7thspace.com/optical_illusions/visual-illusion-21.html\">two face/candlestick thing</a>. The sound waves hitting your ear drum aren\u2019t doing anything wrong, but your brain is processing them in ways which end up as confusing and befuddling. </p> <p>It gets even more surreal when other senses get involved. Taste is especially vulnerable to <a href=\"http://www.scaa.org/chronicle/2012/07/06/the-tasting-experience-our-five-senses-and-some-of-the-ways-they-influence-each-other/\">other senses getting involved</a>, but our hearing is often overruled by vision. If you go to a cinema, you perceive the sound coming from the screen. It\u2019s not, though; it\u2019s coming from the speakers surrounding you. But we don\u2019t perceive that; our brains hear sound and see movement and talking on the screen, so determine that that\u2019s where it\u2019s coming from. Despite the fact that it\u2019s not. </p> <p>Check out <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-lN8vWm3m0\">the McGurk Effect</a> for a more blatant example of this. This may also explain why, when a video has the visual and audio out-of-synch, it can be very hard to watch. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b805e77cd3fea033682a495cea93cb7a75cf7de8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b805e77cd3fea033682a495cea93cb7a75cf7de8/0_0_5124_3075/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Mishearing important words has been the cause of a many a humorous misunderstanding and divorce.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mishearing important words has been the cause of a many a humorous misunderstanding and divorce.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Piotr Powietrzynski/Getty Images/age fotostock RM</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Any and all of these things can happen at any given time. When you\u2019re only half-listening to something, not giving it your full attention, it can be even easier as things are more ambiguous. A simple word like \u201ckite\u201d can become a far more alarming one like the unfortunate c-word, especially if the preceding word features similar syllabic and phonetic elements, like \u201cfluttering\u201d does. It suggests a rhythm that could easily fool a half-concentrating brain.</p> <p>Why would so many other people hear it too, though? Because, as previously stated, much of what we perceive is based on expectation. As soon as you see an article or video online titled \u201cDid He Really Say That!?!\u201d or even just asking \u201cWhat do you think this guy is saying?\u201d, that predisposes people to expect something unusual/shocking. And, as stated, expectation plays a big part in perception. The extra-weird thing is that, once the brain has decided what it\u2019s heard, it\u2019s <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mumpsimus\">very difficult to hear anything else</a>, no matter how unlikely or illogical its conclusions may be. The brain doesn\u2019t like questioning or doubting itself. So it doesn\u2019t do that. And if you still doubt that your brain will do this, just remember \u201c<a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/head-quarters/2015/feb/27/the-dress-blue-black-white-gold-vision-psychology-colour-constancy\">that dress</a>\u201d.</p> <p>This isn\u2019t to say that TV presenters would <em>never </em>say the C-word, of course. <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/4gy9s2/all_the_people_who_have_accidentally/\">Just ask Jeremy Hunt about that</a>.</p> <p><em>Dean Burnett has written a book about the many things the brain does wrong. </em><em> </em><a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Idiot-Brain-Neuroscientist-Explains-Really/dp/1783350814/ref=sr_1_1_twi_pap_2?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1461961162&amp;sr=1-1\"><em>The Idiot Brain</em></a><em> </em><em>is available now in</em><em> </em><a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/catalog/product/view/id/370462/s/idiot-brain/\"><em>the UK</em></a><em>,</em><em> </em><a href=\"http://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/idiot-brain-dean-burnett/1122688091?ean=9780393253788#productInfoTabs\"><em>US</em></a><em> </em><em>and <a href=\"http://www.harpercollins.ca/9781443450065/the-idiot-brain\">Canada</a>.</em></p>",

The companies involved all deny any wrongdoing and say they comply with the law in the countries in which they operate.</p> <p>Public Eye, however, says the result is \u201cregulatory arbitrage\u201d that allows traders and fuel companies to dump cheap, dirty fuels by blending them into other diesel before export, maximising profits at the expense of Africans\u2019 health. Erik Solheim, the director of the UN Environment Programme (UNEP) called the practice unacceptable. </p> <p>Last week, the World Bank said <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2016/sep/08/air-pollution-costs-trillions-holds-back-poor-countries-world-bank\">air pollution was among the biggest killers worldwide</a>, costing developing countries billions of dollars in lost income. Vehicle emissions are a significant contributor to air pollution, which is why in Europe the maximum sulphur content of diesel has been set at 10 parts per million (ppm) since 2009.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5dbc1f4359f7188424768f925f0902d26be5c172\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5dbc1f4359f7188424768f925f0902d26be5c172/0_0_1080_1618/667.jpg\" alt=\"The Probo Koala, a tanker chartered by Trafigura, dumped toxic waste in the Ivory Coast in 2006.\" width=\"667\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Probo Koala, a tanker chartered by Trafigura, dumped toxic waste in Ivory Coast in 2006.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Raigo Pajula/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In parts of Africa, the legal limit on sulphur in diesel is 5,000 ppm, although UNEP has been working to bring this down. The rapid growth of urban dwelling and car ownership in the developing world means that more Africans are exposed to high vehicle emissions.<br></p> <p>The high-sulphur fuels also have a knock-on effect, rapidly destroying emission-reducing technologies in vehicles, according to Rob de Jong, the head of the UNEP transport programme. \u201cSo if you buy a vehicle that\u2019s a couple of years old and import it into some of the African countries, the technology in there \u2013 sensors and filters \u2013 all gets spoilt, and these cars, which are potentially very clean, are destroyed in a couple of tanks, and for the next 20 years will be belching smoke,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s important to understand the tragedy of this,\u201d he said.</p> <p>This in turn increases emissions of fine particulate matter, which can lodge deep in the lungs, causing cancers and other health problems.</p> <p>Public Eye tested diesel sold at the pumps of outlets partly owned by various Swiss trading companies in eight countries across sub-Saharan Africa, and found that more than two thirds of the fuel they sampled had sulphur levels of more than 1,500ppm, 150 times the European limit. </p> <p>Data shared with the Guardian shows that ships chartered by BP imported cargoes tested at more than 3,600 ppm in 2013, when the legal sulphur limit was still 5,000 ppm. In 2014, when the legal limit had been reduced to 3,000 ppm, BP shipments identified in the data registered sulphur content of 2,500 ppm.</p> <p>Public Eye\u2019s interest in the area was first sparked after the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/may/13/trafigura-ivory-coast-waste\">Probo Koala</a>, a tanker chartered by Trafigura, dumped toxic waste in the Ivory Coast in 2006.

  "<p>Last week\u2019s roasting of Mark Zuckerberg over <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/sep/08/facebook-mark-zuckerberg-napalm-girl-photo-vietnam-war?CMP=share_btn_tw\">Facebook\u2019s decision to censor the most iconic photograph of the Vietnam war</a> has once again turned a favored son of Silicon Valley into a public punching bag. It happens pretty often, although typically the damage is more spontaneously self-inflicted. Tech executives seem to have a special talent for doing or saying infuriating things.</p> <p>Indeed, hardly a week goes by without a powerful person in Silicon Valley upsetting a significant number of people. Whether it\u2019s Marc Andreessen <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/feb/11/marc-andreessens-colonialism-tweet-silicon-valley-facebook-india\">declaring that India was better off under British colonial rule</a>, or Marc Benioff <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/12/black-lives-matter-marc-benioff-facebook-twitter-uber\">seeing Black Lives Matter as a branding opportunity</a>, or Elon Musk <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/jul/07/tesla-elon-musk-autopilot-death-crisis-management\">shrugging off</a> the death of a Tesla driver using the car\u2019s autopilot feature, tech industry titans are the stuff that PR nightmares are made of.</p> <p>Why is the tech industry so frequently enraging? The most obvious answer is its insularity. The industry remains heavily concentrated in the San Francisco Bay Area, and its upper ranks form a fairly close-knit community. An act or opinion that elicits vigorous approval within this community might set off a tsunami of outrage outside of it, a disconnect that many tech elites seem unaware of.</p> <p>Silicon Valley\u2019s leaders are also accustomed to being treated differentially, even worshipfully, by a tech press that faithfully parrots their press releases and a political class that hails them as the saviors of the American economy. If they act a bit too bullish or speak a bit too freely, it\u2019s because they\u2019ve been encouraged to. If they respond poorly to criticism, it\u2019s because their skins haven\u2019t been given the opportunity to thicken.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>To change the world, Silicon Valley\u2019s leaders must do battle with the forces that want to keep it the way it is</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>But these reasons provide only a partial explanation. Silicon Valley may offer an especially extreme case, but the bosses of any industry are insular by virtue of their power and wealth. You could hardly accuse the overlords of the financial sector of being in touch with the everyday lives of ordinary Americans. The more meaningful question isn\u2019t whether tech is an island, but what kind of island it is. </p> <p>The most important thing to understand about tech elites is that they\u2019re idealists. When they talk about changing the world, they mean it. This is hard for outside observers to understand, who are often inclined to dismiss tech\u2019s transformational rhetoric as hackneyed marketing chatter. It may be hackneyed, but it is also deeply felt among industry leaders. </p> <p>This idealism is the legacy of the 60s and 70s counterculture, which continues to exert enormous ideological influence on Silicon Valley. Historian <a href=\"http://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/F/bo3773600.html\">Fred Turner</a> has chronicled how cultural entrepreneurs such as Stewart Brand and the editors of Wired magazine powerfully shaped tech\u2019s image of itself \u2013 so powerfully that even the 20-year-old founder who has never heard of Brand or never read Wired<em> </em>in the 90s is living in the world they created. The techno-utopian consensus comes in many flavors, but at its core is the idea that technology is a tool for personal empowerment that can radically restructure society for the better.</p> <p>Utopia won\u2019t arrive without a fight, however. To change the world, Silicon Valley\u2019s leaders must do battle with the forces that want to keep it the way it is. This is the other half of hippiedom: rebellion against the big, boring institutions that enslave society. The cosmology of the counterculture was never complicated: it\u2019s the Empire \u2013 authoritarian, bureaucratic, collectivist \u2013 v the Rebel Alliance \u2013 scrappy, romantic, individualist. It may seem strange that the people running one of the most profitable sectors of the economy think of themselves as rebels. But for the idealists of Silicon Valley, fulfilling their ideals necessarily involves a frontal assault on the establishment. Witness their fondness for the word \u201cdisruption\u201d, which conveys the joyful violence of smashing the status quo. Or the Facebook motto \u201cmove fast and break things\u201d, which surely applies to more than just code.</p> <p>Seeing tech elites the way they see themselves, as utopian revolutionaries, helps clarify why they so often stumble into controversy. If you believe that your industry is an instrument of human liberation, then you\u2019re likely to feel an excess of confidence in your ability to tackle or speak about subjects you know nothing about \u2013 in much the same way that a Christian fundamentalist might feel qualified to give an opinion on homosexuality, say, or the age of the universe. And if you believe that you are saving the world through an act of creative rebellion, then you may react angrily to criticism, because it feels like ingratitude. Here you are struggling to destroy the Empire, and this is the thanks you get?</p> <p>Andreessen\u2019s remark about the benefits of British colonialism offers an instructive example. A venture capitalist and Facebook board member, Andreessen was responding to the Indian government\u2019s decision to ban Facebook\u2019s Free Basics program, a free mobile service aimed at bringing the internet to people too poor to pay for it. This seemingly philanthropic gesture was motivated by self-interest: Facebook would determine which apps and which kinds of data would be permitted, forming a digital dictatorship over large parts of India that would pay dividends down the road. Indians responded with fierce <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jan/15/india-net-neutrality-activists-facebook-free-basics\">protests</a> that eventually succeeded in killing the experiment.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Tech was making the world a better place\u200b\u200b \u2013 yet the world it was making wasn\u2019t one that millions wanted to live in</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>In a tweet, Andreessen blamed India\u2019s rejection of Free Basics on an \u201canti-colonialism that has been economically catastrophic\u201d for the country. The intensity of this response, which required days of damage control to retract, suggests he was truly incensed at the thought that the interests of Silicon Valley and those of the human race as a whole might not coincide. Tech was making the world a better place \u2013 yet the world it was making wasn\u2019t one that millions of Indians wanted to live in. </p> <p>The reality is that Silicon Valley isn\u2019t a force for good or evil, but something more prosaic: a force for capital accumulation. Its executives may talk about radical transformation, but their transformations aren\u2019t particularly radical. No one would dispute that companies such as Apple, Facebook and Google have changed much about our lives. But compared with the extraordinary innovations of the 20th century, and the expectations these produced about a space-faring, Jetsonian future, the world of apps looks pretty meager. Peter Thiel, whose contrarianism runs so deep it even out-contrarians the contrarians of Silicon Valley, puts it perfectly: \u201cWe wanted flying cars, instead we got 140 characters.\u201d </p> <p>What\u2019s changed even less, however, is the economic regime where these modest transformations take place. Tech elites may like to think of themselves as rule-breakers, but they play by the same rules as the rest of American capitalism. The future they imagine for us is one in which markets predominate and small numbers of large corporations continue to own society\u2019s wealth. This is ultimately what the Rebel Alliance has to offer: the same political economy as the Empire, with better UI. Fortunately, there\u2019s nothing foreordained about this future. Forging an alternative will require following the Indian example, and building a movement from below. It may bruise a few egos, and inflame a few tempers, but the emotional discomfort it causes the billionaire prophets of Silicon Valley will be well worth the result.</p>",

About which there is optimism, so much so that there are now ideas being floated that might be considered positively revolutionary.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2016/sep/09/chase-carey-new-life-f1-bernie-ecclestone-neglect\">Chase Carey will breathe new life into F1 after Bernie Ecclestone neglect | Paul Weaver</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Pleasing as it might be to consider Lewis Hamilton noting post-race that he wanted to thank the team for working so hard on his car, making the right strategy calls and helping him deal mercilessly with a group of revisionist collaborators, the drivers will not be manning barricades. Indeed, although Mercedes suffered here under the lights of Singapore last year, unable to make the super-soft tyres work, with Sebastian Vettel <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/sep/20/f1-sebastian-vettel-singapore-intruder-walks-on-to-track-lewis-hamilton\" title=\"\">taking what was Ferrari\u2019s last race win</a>, the Briton is confident that his team has identified and dealt with the issues and expect no repeat of the difficulties. On track, with resources now shifted to building the 2017 cars, radical transformation will have to wait until Australia next year at best.</p> <p>Off track however, what is to be done? Outside the sport, the reaction to Liberty\u2019s purchase and its subsequent announcements of plans to expand it around social media, promotion and marketing has been better than one imagines they expected. The company\u2019s stock price rose by 15% on Tuesday as the volume of shares traded increased dramatically. The money men like it, as well they might given that CVC had made $8.2bn in 2014 since its initial investment of $2bn in 2006. But it is also this economic engine that could be the force for real change.</p> <p>One of the most pressing issues of recent years has been the very survival of the smaller teams and central to that is the distribution of prize money between competitors. Sauber and Force India have lodged an official complaint with the EU over the current system of dividing revenues that favours the big five \u2013 Mercedes, Ferrari, Red Bull, McLaren and Williams \u2013 over the rest.</p> <p>The issue is raised with positively Stakhanovite zeal at the Friday conferences attended by team principals and always provokes the same responses. The smaller teams think it is unfair and the big boys are \u2013 in principle \u2013 in favour of them receiving more, as long as it does not come out of their share. The vested interests involved created an impasse that has shown no sign of being broken and by which the previous owners were entirely unconcerned as long as it did not affect their bottom line.</p> <p>While Liberty have said they have no plan for the time being to review the current payment structure, there is still a sense that change is in the air. They have proposed that teams will have the opportunity to participate in the investment in F1, which, although short on detail, has been cautiously welcomed. Might the teams go further though, might they use this as a chance to effect real change, for the long-term benefit of F1?</p> <p>\u201cThe sport has been crying out for a very long time for something like this to happen,\u201d Anthony Indaimo tells me.</p> <p>Very few will recognise Indaimo\u2019s name, but his opinion is worth bearing out. He is head of corporate at Withers, a law firm with an international sports practice across 18 offices globally involving F1 teams and drivers. It has been part of the sport since 1986, when it arranged the sale of Tyrrell to Benetton, and has been involved in negotiating F1 TV deals and also worked with BMW Sauber, the original Renault F1, Lotus, Marussia, Caterham and now represents two of the current top drivers as well as the modern Renault Sport Racing. They reviewed the current bilateral agreements that cover the teams\u2019 payments and are in place until 2020 and, crucially, were involved with the Formula One Teams Association (Fota) \u2013 the last time they acted collectively and successfully, when in dispute with the FIA over regulation changes in 2009.</p> <p>\u201cThe dynamics of the different relationship [with Liberty] might force the teams to act together in a way that they wouldn\u2019t be able to do but for this change,\u201d Indaimo explains. \u201cI say this because nobody thought that Fota would be formed or that it would be successful. We were intimately involved with that so we know what happened. This acquisition might prove to be a similar catalyst.\u201d</p> <p>The redistribution of wealth in F1 centrally concerns three facets. Cost-cutting \u2013 which has never worked \u2013 redividing the current revenues and increasing the overall revenues so each team receives more. Liberty clearly has plans to achieve the latter but a redivision might also be possible.</p> <p>Indaimo says: \u201cWhat you might see is a couple of the top teams sitting in a room and thinking: \u2018The financial agreement expires in 2020, that\u2019s set in stone but what should we be doing now to really leverage our position and make our voice heard.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>This is a collective muscle-flexing that is more than possible, he believes. \u201cIn 2014, F1 revenues were \u00a31.8bn approximately and 50% is taken by the owners. There are only a couple of variables you need to discuss and negotiate so that everybody gets more. Prize money to the teams should be 55% as opposed to 50%. A 5% differential of \u00a31.8bn is a lot. Then you also look at the revenue pie increasing and there is more for everybody.</p> <p>\u201cThese are the discussions that need to be had and will be had in the not-too-distant future.\u201d</p> <p>Against all this is the hard fact that acting in concert in recent years has been painfully hard, as the protracted and often fruitless strategy group meetings on regulation changes have proved. However, the vested interests involved then were less easily solved. Since in this case the idea of fairer payments has already been agreed as long as no one is worse off, acting together would have no direct impact on the racing but would be of benefit to the sport as a whole.</p> <p>\u201cThis might be the time when the teams put their differences aside and come together for a common purpose,\u201d Indaimo says.</p> <p>It\u2019s an idea at least. And that is where all good revolutions begin.</p>",
  "<p>It\u2019s finally happened. After weeks of speculation, and despite a hastily called review by Theresa May, the government has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/sep/15/hinkley-point-c-nuclear-power-station-gets-go-ahead\" title=\"\">given a green light</a> to the most expensive white elephant of a project in British history.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/sep/23/hinkley-point-squandermania-george-osborne-china\">With Hinkley Point, squandermania has reached dangerous new heights | Simon Jenkins</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The nuclear power station proposed at Hinkley Point is no ordinary piece of infrastructure. Indeed, <a href=\"http://www.greenpeace.org.uk/blog/nuclear/new-petition-stop-hinkley-nuclear-plant-and-spend-money-renewable-instead-20160307\" title=\"\">according to Greenpeace</a> it will be the most costly object ever built on Earth. A large chunk of the funds for the construction will come from China as part of a deal that will see it lead on the development of another reactor in Bradwell, Essex.</p> <p>EDF, an energy company owned by the French state, will stump up the rest of the construction costs. Just months after people in this country voted to \u201ctake back control\u201d, ministers want to place a big chunk of our energy system in the hands of foreign governments.</p> <p>The amount of cash for this project that is set to be provided by UK taxpayers is eye-watering. The National Audit Office produced a detailed <a href=\"https://www.nao.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Nuclear-power-in-the-UK.pdf\" title=\"\">report</a> in July on the viability of nuclear power in the UK, significantly revising its estimates of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/jul/13/hinkley-point-c-cost-30bn-top-up-payments-nao-report\" title=\"\">\u201ccontract for difference\u201d subsidies</a>, up from \u00a36.1bn to \u00a329.7bn. Essentially, UK bill payers and businesses are underwriting the whole project through a promise of unjustifiably high payments for every unit of electricity produced.</p> <p>This is a terrible deal that has been slammed by economists and environmentalists alike for locking us into paying twice the current wholesale electricity price for 35 years.</p> <p>Though the case against Hinkley can easily be made on financial grounds alone, it\u2019s not only wasted money that marks this project out as extremely risky. At the heart of the problems with nuclear energy is the stark fact that there is still no solution to the nuclear waste problem. Over its lifetime Hinkley will produce waste equivalent to 80% of all the waste so far produced in the UK in terms of radioactivity. Having such highly dangerous spent fuel on site for up to 200 years will be a massive challenge.</p> <p>Earlier this month a <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-37255980\" title=\"\">terrifying expos\u00e9 by the BBC</a> revealed the risks associated with handling nuclear waste, with allegations that years of neglect have led to the nuclear-processing facility at Sellafield being \u201criddled with safety flaws\u201d.</p> <p>Added to the waste issue are serious concerns about the viability of the reactor planned for Hinkley. It\u2019s known as the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/jul/28/what-do-we-know-about-hinkley-points-technology\" title=\"\">EPR</a>, and has not yet been shown to work anywhere in the world. Indeed every project in Europe and China using this kind of technology is facing huge cost overruns and delays. Vincent de Rivaz, EDF\u2019s chief executive, had promised that Hinkley would be cooking Christmas turkeys in 2017, when even under best-case scenarios the project will have barely even been started by then. In fact, Hinkley is unlikely to provide power until the late 2020s \u2013 far too late if we\u2019re serious about weaning ourselves off fossil fuels with the haste that\u2019s needed.</p> <p>Perhaps the most absurd aspect of this project is that fact that it\u2019s being waved through while cheaper and cleaner alternatives are being blocked. According to the National Grid\u2019s energy scenarios, by 2020 small-scale distributed generation will represent a third of total capacity in the UK. But the government is now actively undermining progress. Beneath a layer of green spin, ministers are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/jul/24/the-9-green-policies-killed-off-by-tory-government\" title=\"\">demolishing the UK\u2019s renewable-energy and energy-saving policies</a>. Last week it was revealed that only 10 new community energy organisations have been registered so far this year, compared with 76 last year.</p> <p>The evidence for alternatives is clear: smart meters, home and grid-scale batteries that store and release excess renewable power, and other modern solutions would be cheaper and more efficient than building new power stations to meet extra demand during relatively short periods. The cost of wind and solar has dropped significantly, and we know that a nationwide scheme of home insulation would hugely reduce demand, keep people warm in their homes and provide jobs in every constituency for a fraction of the price of Hinkley.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/jul/27/hinkley-point-c-no-more-than-doomed-attempt-face-saving\">Hinkley Point C is no more than a doomed attempt at face-saving</a> </p> </aside>  <p>With the evidence against Hinkley so overwhelming, it has been puzzling to see Labour swing behind the project. Indeed, just a week after Jeremy Corbyn launched a genuinely decent plan to decentralise energy production in Britain, it is baffling that his party<a href=\"https://www.politicshome.com/news/uk/energy/renewable-energy/media-interview/77753/barry-gardiner-labour-would-not-scrap-hinkley\" title=\"\"> now backs</a> this monstrously expensive, centralised project that is going to be part-owned by the Chinese state.</p> <p>Ultimately the government, and opposition parties, need to decide what kind of Britain they want to build. Do we keep ploughing billions into mammoth infrastructure projects such as Hinkley, or do we refocus resources and build up an energy democracy from the bottom up?</p> <p>Make no mistake, nuclear power will suck resources away from building the energy infrastructure we need, and threaten our climate change targets because of the snail\u2019s pace at which it will be built.</p> <p>Politics is all about choices. I\u2019m urging ministers to choose a future where power is in the hands of the many, not the few \u2013 and where Britain puts to use its most abundant resources: the sun, sea and wind.</p>",

  "<p>Liverpool councillors have unanimously backed a motion calling on retailers in the city to stop selling the Sun newspaper.</p> <p>A widespread boycott of the newspaper has been in place across Merseyside for more than 25 years in protest at the paper\u2019s coverage of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/apr/26/hillsborough-disaster-deadly-mistakes-and-lies-that-lasted-decades\">1989 Hillsborough stadium disaster</a>, which left 96 people dead. </p> <p>At a council meeting in Liverpool town hall on Wednesday night, councillors backed a motion calling on shops to stop selling the paper, condemning it for publishing \u201cblatant lies\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cDue to crowd control mismanagement those fans, whose ages ranged from 10 to 67 years old, had the life crushed out of them,\u201d the motion said. \u201cContrary to the facts, the S*n published a front page story with the banner headline \u2018The Truth\u2019 which contained blatant lies.\u201d</p> <p>The paper\u2019s initial coverage claimed that Liverpool fans were drunk and had attacked those trying to help the victims of the disaster. The report claimed that fans had pickpocketed the dead and urinated on police.</p> <p>\u201cFor this reason we call on all retailers and vendors of newspapers in Liverpool to stop selling the S*n,\u201d said the motion, which applauded the work by campaign group Total Eclipse of the Sun for working to \u201crid Liverpool of the paper\u201d. </p> <p>A spokesman for the Sun said they would not be commenting on the vote.</p> <p>After <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/apr/26/hillsborough-inquests-jury-says-96-victims-were-unlawfully-killed\">an inquest verdict in April</a>, which found that the 96 victims had been unlawfully killed, the Sun again apologised for its coverage of the disaster, but drew criticism for being one of the few national newspapers not to put the verdict on its front page.</p> <p>The paper\u2019s leader column following the inquest ruling said: \u201cThe supporters were not to blame. But the police smeared them with a pack of lies which in 1989 the Sun and others in the media swallowed whole.</p> <p>\u201cWe apologised prominently 12 years ago, again four years ago on the front page, and do so unreservedly again now. Further, we pay tribute to the admirable tenacity of the friends and relatives over so many years on behalf of the 96 who died.\u201d</p> <p>Speaking ahead of the vote, Hillsborough survivor Ralph Hadley, from the Total Eclipse of the Sun campaign, said that around 220 shops had already agreed to stop selling the paper.</p> <p>The mayor of Liverpool, Joe Anderson, said the newspaper would \u201cnever, ever\u201d be forgiven for its coverage of the disaster. \u201cIf I had my way and we could legally do it, I would ban it from shops across the city region,\u201d he added.</p> <p>MP Steve Rotheram, Labour\u2019s candidate to be metro mayor of the Liverpool city region, welcomed the councillors\u2019 move. \u201cI commend the work the Total Eclipse of the Sun group is carrying out to promote and celebrate establishments across our area that do not sell the S*n,\u201d he said in a statement. </p> <p>\u201cI know individuals will agree with me that the lies and smears they peddled in coverage about the Hillsborough disaster were abhorrent.

The Marshallese may use faded US dollar bills, daub murals of LeBron James and Steph Curry on walls and retain the names Rita (after Rita Hayworth) and Laura (after Lauren Bacall) for the two ends of the curved Majuro island, but the relationship with America is a complicated one. </p> <p>A US military base remains at Kwajalein, where unarmed missiles periodically land, fired from California. Many Marshallese serve in the US army, while the rest of the population each gets around $500 a year via a trust fund set up to compensate the harrowing nuclear tests. Still, many feel it\u2019s not enough given the legacy of trauma. </p> <p>\u201cIt appalls me the way the US has treated the Marshallese people out here,\u201d says Jack Niedenthal, a native Pennsylvanian who came to the Marshall Islands with the Peace Corps in 1981 and never left. </p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s just a really dark spot, I think, in US history.

A lack of a US-funded cancer clinic is a particular frustration. \u201cIt was so easy for them to spend millions of dollars to do the testing but why is it so hard to help the people that they moved off of Bikini atoll? A lot of people are very upset.\u201d</p> <p>Kramer is part of a relatively influential Marshallese clan \u2013 her husband is a leading construction magnate in Majuro. But a comfortable life in the US won\u2019t represent home, just like Kili doesn\u2019t now.

The heat can be blistering all year round. Life proceeds at a plod, the cars trundling along at barely 15mph, the friendly populace showing few signs of impatience or haste. </p> <p>The minimum wage is just $2 and that is if you are lucky \u2013 the unemployment rate is <a href=\"http://www.theodora.com/wfbcurrent/marshall_islands/marshall_islands_economy.html\">around 36%</a>. The country produces coconuts and breadfruit, and sells fishing licenses for the international trawlers that scour Marshallese waters for tuna, but it leans heavily upon the aid of others. Majuro\u2019s police station, courts and street lighting were funded by Japan and Taiwan, the latter country getting Marshallese recognition in the UN in return. </p> <p>Half of the Marshall Islands population is aged under 24 and many inevitably wonder how life would play out in the US, even if it is cloaked in the language of duty. Family bonds are sprawling yet iron-clad in Marshallese culture \u2013 moving countries is largely aimed at helping the family thrive financially or socially.</p> <p>\u201cA lot of people feel like the United States is the promised land, and that\u2019s where a lot of them wind up going,\u201d says Niedenthal, the former Peace Corps member who has helped administer the trust fund for years but is now packing up his office, disillusioned. \u201cMost times they buy one-way tickets.

As they get into their Marshallese flag dresses (<em>ratak</em>, meaning \u201csunrise\u201d, and <em>r\u0101lik</em>, \u201csunset\u201d, are the central elements of the national emblem) the room is filled with teenage American accents talking about teenage American things.

But the Marshallese community, now numbering around 10,000, remains close-knit. </p> <p>Legend has it they congregated at this unlikely, nondescript place because of a pioneer named John Moody, who moved to the area first through education and then work in the 1970s. </p> <p>Moody toiled for nearly 20 years in the <a href=\"http://www.tyson.com/\">Tysons</a> poultry plant, gutting and packing chickens. The work was smelly and dangerous \u2013 Moody lost the tip of his index finger to a factory saw \u2013 but the pay was a major upgrade on the Marshall Islands.</p> <p>Tysons, along with fellow chicken producer George\u2019s, remains a major employer of Marshallese people in Springdale. Walmart\u2019s headquarters, located up the road in Bentonville, is another major feature of the local economy.</p> <p>The Marshallese are an object of curiosity here, but are largely accepted by a population that has has become more diverse in recent years. White, Latino and Marshallese students rub shoulders at the <a href=\"http://har-ber.sdale.org/\">Har-Ber high school</a> in Springdale, where the Marshallese passion for basketball is well appreciated. \u201cIf they were taller than 5ft 3in we\u2019d have the best team around,\u201d the basketball coach admits, a little ruefully.</p> <p> Melines Morris, who moved to Springdale from the Marshall Islands as a five-year-old, says she is often confused for a Hawaiian person.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"53cb15191f8e729e0e207e9bc15b85d3f9f46137\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/53cb15191f8e729e0e207e9bc15b85d3f9f46137/0_0_5643_3762/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Teenagers get ready for the first Marshallese beauty contest in Springdale, Arkansas.

I\u2019m from the Marshall Islands. You can call me marshmallow.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Like many Marshallese in Springdale, Morris\u2019s family is fractured. Her mother\u2019s side of the family came to Arkansas but her father stayed in the Marshall Islands, where he has been ever since, speaking to his daughter over Skype or Facebook. Morris was plunged into a new reality, a world of McDonald\u2019s and Valentine\u2019s day and Hanukkah, without being able to speak English. But she is now what many people would expect of a stereotypical American teen.</p> <p>\u201cWhen I first started here, I always wanted to tell myself \u2018I\u2019m American\u2019, because I thought it was really cool coming here and then seeing new faces,\u201d she says. \u201cAs I grew up, I knew more about my culture, and then I really liked it. I was telling myself: \u2018Wow, I\u2019m blessed to have this culture.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Morris now attempts to straddle both worlds, of Snapchat and of Marshallese customs on clothing and behavior, as well as celebrations such as <em>kemem</em>, a big bash thrown at the first birthday of a child. She says she was \u201cvery angry\u201d when she heard about what climate change was doing to the Marshall Islands and wants to go back to help \u2013 but not to live.</p> <p>Arlynda Jonas, 23, is also inclined to stay in the US. Like Morris she has an American accent, which she says some Marshallese people tease her about. </p> <p>\u201cI feel like I\u2019m more towards the American side than my Marshallese side but I know that I should be on my Marshallese side more strongly,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s really hard. I don\u2019t want to forget my culture, my heritage or anything.\u201d</p> <p>At the Constitution Day parade in Springdale, the tone is a little more defiant. The celebrations have been given a climate change theme, giving the occasion more of a protest than a party feel. Banners proclaim \u201c70 years of exile\u201d for the Bikinian people and \u201c1.5 to stay alive\u201d, referring to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/apr/14/worlds-scientists-to-join-forces-on-major-15c-climate-change-report\">global temperature rise that can\u2019t be breached</a> if the Marshall Islands is to survive. Candies are tossed to onlooking children as the parade passes by.</p> <p>Kenneth Kedi, speaker of the Marshallese parliament, is in Springdale to address the crowd. Kedi decries the salt-soaked soils of home, ruined for crops, and the disastrous drought. Climate change \u201cisn\u2019t shenanigans, it\u2019s reality\u201d, Kedi says.</p> <p>Kedi spent six years in the US and is now putting his son through school here.

Marshallese people are often deeply religious \u2013 most of the population is Protestant. Large sections of the address is in Marshallese but at one point the pastor blurts out in English while referencing climate change: \u201cWhat is going on?\u201d</p> <p>Pageant contenders read out poems on climate change.

  "<p>Gabriel Gabor remembers a time in 1998 when he was promoting MLS to the midwest market with the help of one of the league\u2019s most celebrated Latino players, Carlos Valderrama. \u201cWe would walk down Main Street in Kansas City, and nobody would bother us,\u201d says Gabor, who now focuses on developing and cultivating the Hispanic and Latino market for the league. \u201cNowadays, if I walked down the street with the same player, we would get stopped every second \u2013 and the reason is because the Hispanic population in the midwest has exploded. These regions are very different to how they were 20 years ago.\u201d</p> <p>This is no exaggeration. The US Hispanic community is the largest ethnic or racial minority group in the country, making up more than 17% of the population: by 2060 it is estimated that proportion will have grown to 28.6%. Gabor, who is of Argentinian descent, knows that in order for MLS to succeed it needs the Hispanic and Latino community. \u201cWe view the Hispanic market as part of our DNA. It\u2019s part of how we function and everything we do,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s no coincidence that we were the first league [in the US] to have a full-time, Spanish language, cultural, bilingual staff. Why? A large percentage of our fans are Hispanic, a lot of our players are Hispanic, and so the teams have changed because of that and franchises have adapted and evolved because of this very fact.\u201d</p> <p>When it comes to identifying the importance of the Hispanic community, MLS leads the way among US sports leagues. And there have been specific plans of action that have helped this growth. \u201cTo us it\u2019s about the difference in how we communicate to Hispanics today as opposed to 15 or 20 years ago,\u201d says Gabor. \u201cThere\u2019s a <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.pewhispanic.org/\">recent survey</a> that showed that the majority of Hispanics in the US are no longer foreign-born, so even though they have the Hispanic culture in their blood, they consume everything in English. So regardless of language, we think about being bicultural and that\u2019s what sets us apart. We\u2019re not just translating news.\u201d</p> <p>MLS\u2019s strategy to specifically target the community by understanding the culture, and not just the language, has been a success. In fact, <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://pressbox.mlssoccer.com/sites/default/files/201603/MLS16-0815_PlayerMap_World_v4_0.pdf\">MLS is the most diverse professional sports league in North America</a>, with players from 59 countries around the world. The league\u2019s social media presence is also impressive. Its bicultural strategy \u2013 both from English and Spanish accounts \u2013 is <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.stonetemple.com/how-major-league-soccer-nails-it-in-social-media/\">confident, without being overbearing</a>, and is aimed at appealing to fans from all cultures, not just Hispanics.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Maidana hugs his fans.\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;instagram-media&quot; data-instgrm-captioned data-instgrm-version=&quot;7&quot; style=&quot; background:#FFF; border:0; border-radius:3px; box-shadow:0 0 1px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.5),0 1px 10px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.15); margin: 1px; max-width:658px; padding:0; width:99.375%; width:-webkit-calc(100% - 2px); width:calc(100% - 2px);&quot;&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;padding:8px;&quot;&gt; &lt;div style=&quot; background:#F8F8F8; line-height:0; margin-top:40px; padding:50.0% 0; text-align:center; width:100%;&quot;&gt; &lt;div style=&quot; background:url(data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAACwAAAAsCAMAAAApWqozAAAABGdBTUEAALGPC/xhBQAAAAFzUkdCAK7OHOkAAAAMUExURczMzPf399fX1+bm5mzY9AMAAADiSURBVDjLvZXbEsMgCES5/P8/t9FuRVCRmU73JWlzosgSIIZURCjo/ad+EQJJB4Hv8BFt+IDpQoCx1wjOSBFhh2XssxEIYn3ulI/6MNReE07UIWJEv8UEOWDS88LY97kqyTliJKKtuYBbruAyVh5wOHiXmpi5we58Ek028czwyuQdLKPG1Bkb4NnM+VeAnfHqn1k4+GPT6uGQcvu2h2OVuIf/gWUFyy8OWEpdyZSa3aVCqpVoVvzZZ2VTnn2wU8qzVjDDetO90GSy9mVLqtgYSy231MxrY6I2gGqjrTY0L8fxCxfCBbhWrsYYAAAAAElFTkSuQmCC); display:block; height:44px; margin:0 auto -44px; position:relative; top:-22px; width:44px;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p style=&quot; margin:8px 0 0 0; padding:0 4px;&quot;&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.instagram.com/p/BHYzKjcjL54/&quot; style=&quot; color:#000; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; line-height:17px; text-decoration:none; word-wrap:break-word;&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Hugs for the game winner. #HOUvPHI&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style=&quot; color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px; margin-bottom:0; margin-top:8px; overflow:hidden; padding:8px 0 7px; text-align:center; text-overflow:ellipsis; white-space:nowrap;&quot;&gt;A photo posted by Major League Soccer (@mls) on &lt;time style=&quot; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px;&quot; datetime=&quot;2016-07-03T05:24:52+00:00&quot;&gt;Jul 2, 2016 at 10:24pm PDT&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;script async defer src=&quot;//platform.instagram.com/en_US/embeds.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>There are 101 Hispanic and Latino players born outside the US playing in the league. From El Salvador and Honduras to Colombia and Argentina, these athletes make up a multicultural melting pot that mirrors the different cultures watching from the stands. On film and television, diversity can help movies and shows connect with a wider audience, and that same logic can be applied to sport. And that can be good for business as well as building social bonds.</p> <p>\u201cWhen DC United first came to the area, we had a very good connection with the Latino community,\u201d says Victor Melara, the team\u2019s director of community relations. \u201cWe had prominent players who the community could identify with. Players like Jaime Moreno and Marco Etcheverry from Bolivia, and Ra\u00fal D\u00edaz Arce from El Salvador, really helped build a close tie with the community as some of the biggest Hispanic demographics here in the DC area are from these countries. Once those players left, the team began losing some of that connection and we kept hearing constantly that we weren\u2019t doing enough to attract the Hispanic fan.\u201d</p> <p>DC United listened, and through the years they have made efforts to strengthen the relationship. One includes a partnership with <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.americascores.org/affiliates/dc\">DC Scores</a>, a non-profit organization that offers free after-school programs and summer camps to children from low-income areas. \u201cThey are our official charity partner where we funnel all our charity and fundraising events through them,\u201d says Melara, who grew up in a Salvadoran family in the northwest area of DC. \u201cDC Scores serves about 2,000 youths here in the area, and from that number I would say close to 50% are Hispanic.\u201d</p> <p>Melara understands that interaction is an important way of building trust, so much of the work involves sending out players and coaches to meet local Hispanic communities. Another success has been Partido de las Estrellas, an all-star match involving old and current Hispanic players as well local celebrities. The venue is located in Columbia Heights, a part of the city with a notably large Hispanic and Latino population, and aside from the match itself, there\u2019s music, food and other forms of entertainment celebrating the community\u2019s value to the city.</p> <p>DC United are not the only team who have placed such a strong emphasis on Hispanics, and every team has a strategy on how it can build stronger bridges with the youngest ethnic group in the country. According to Pew Research Center\u2019s Hispanic trend division, 60% of US-Hispanics are millennials or younger (32.5 million) meaning in order to evolve, teams have to value and prioritize the younger generation.</p> <p>As Hispanic Heritage Month gets under way, Gabor wants to emphasize that cultivating and celebrating the Hispanic community is more than just a 30-day project. \u201cWe live in a Hispanic culture, so we\u2019ve never had a specific effort for this month,\u201d he says. \u201cSo we don\u2019t just believe in a Hispanic Heritage Month, we believe in a Hispanic Heritage existence.\u201d</p>",

According to the Inter-Parliamentary Union, women make up less than 10% of MPs in the lower house of Japan\u2019s parliament, and 20% of those in the upper house. Inada is one of only three women in the 20-strong cabinet of the prime minister, Shinzo Abe, whose mission to fill 30% of public and private sector leadership positions with women by 2020 has got off to a disappointing start.</p> <p>Murata, a former swimsuit model who worked as a journalist before being elected to parliament in 2004, seized the opportunity to lead the Democrats after the former leader, Katsuya Okada, said he was stepping down in the wake of the party\u2019s poor performance in July\u2019s upper house elections.</p> <p>During its three years in government from 2009, the party was criticised for mishandling the planned <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/jun/02/japan-prime-minister-yukio-hatoyama-resigns\">relocation of a US marine base</a> on the southern island of Okinawa and for its response to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/fukushima\">triple meltdown at Fukushima Daiichi</a> nuclear power plant in March 2011. The party, whose MPs include an uneasy mix of liberal and conservative defectors from other parties, has never recovered from its <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/dec/16/japanese-conservatives-poll-triumph\">heavy general election defeat</a> in late 2012.</p> <p>A poll by the Asahi Shimbun this week showed support for the LDP at 40%, with the Democrats on just 7%.</p> <p>Murata\u2019s attempts to rebuild the party\u2019s credibility got off to a shaky start, just hours before her expected victory was confirmed on Thursday.</p> <p>Questioned by reporters, she acknowledged that she still held Taiwanese nationality, despite earlier claiming that she had become a naturalised citizen of Japan in 1985 at the age of 17.</p> <p>\u201cI would like to apologise for the confusion caused by my inaccurate recollection of what happened and the contradictions in my recent remarks,\u201d she said, before confirming that she identified herself as Japanese. \u201cI\u2019ve always worked for the good of this, my own country, and I\u2019ll continue to do so,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Japanese law requires people with dual nationality to choose one or the other before they reach the age of 22, although failure to do so is not a crime. Many retain dual nationality under a \u201cdon\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell\u201d policy.</p> <p>The nationality debacle is likely to be seized on by her opponents, however. The conservative Yomiuri Shimbun newspaper described Murata\u2019s confusion over her nationality as a \u201csorry state of affairs\u201d.</p> <p>Despite her assurances this week that she had taken steps to renounce her Taiwanese citizenship, the newspaper said in an editorial: \u201cIt is out of the question for a legislator \u2013 who is supposed to serve the interests of the nation, including in foreign affairs and national security \u2013 to leave their own nationality obscure.\u201d</p> <p>The Yomiuri suggested that some might question her loyalty to Japan, particularly over foreign policy issues where it is in disagreement with Taiwan.</p> <p>\u201cAlthough Taiwan is friendly towards Japan, it is in conflict with the Japanese standpoint regarding some issues, for instance, its ownership claims on the Senkaku islands,\u201d the paper said. \u201cIf Renho retains her Taiwan citizenship, she could become the target of undesirable suspicions regarding her relations with Taiwan.\u201d </p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/senkaku-islands\">Senkakus</a> are administered by Japan but also claimed by China and Taiwan.</p> <p>During her leadership campaign, Murata vowed to protect the war-renouncing article of Japan\u2019s postwar constitution, as speculation mounts that Abe will use his party\u2019s big parliamentary majority to trigger changes that would end the military\u2019s strictly defensive role.<br></p>",

The leak of these records is an attempt to undermine the credibility of Wada and that\u2019s something for them to deal with.\u201d</p> <p>As well as the two leading cyclists, golfer Charley Hull, rower Sam Townsend and rugby union player Heather Fisher are included in the second batch of athletes whose details have been made public by cyber-espionage group Fancy Bears, which is believed to be from Russia. There is no suggestion of any wrongdoing by any of the athletes.</p> <p>In a separate development, UK Anti-Doping (Ukad) has written to Team GB athletes warning them that their medical records could be at risk of exposure.</p> <p>The letter states: \u201cUkad is in close contact with Wada and it has been confirmed to us that the group has accessed some athlete data.

We are working hard to urgently determine what impact, if any, this may have on you and other British athletes, and exactly what information, if any, may have been compromised.\u201d</p> <p>Ukad also urge athletes to be vigilant where use of computer passwords is concerned. \u201cRemember, no sporting or anti-doping organisation, including Wada, will ever ask you for your password, and you should not divulge this to anyone under any circumstance. If you are concerned about the security of your password, we strongly recommend that you take steps to change it.\u201d</p> <p>Wada <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/sep/13/wada-russian-cyber-attack-espionage-group\">first fell victim to hackers on Tuesday</a> when medical records relating to TUEs granted to certain athletes were leaked. TUEs can be issued to athletes who have an illness or condition which requires the use of medication that is on WADA\u2019s prohibited list.</p> <p>The latest leaks suggest that Rio gold medallist Wiggins, who has never made any secret of the fact he suffers from asthma, has several TUEs for salbutamol, a substance commonly used in an inhaler.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the three-times Tour de France winner Froome has TUEs for prednisolone, a steroid that can be used to treat chest complaints. In a statement on Thursday, Team Sky, for whom Froome rides, said: \u201cApplications made by Team Sky for TUEs have all been managed and recorded in line with the processes put in place by the governing bodies. Team Sky\u2019s approach to anti-doping \u2013 and our commitment to clean competition \u2013 are well known.\u201d</p> <p>A British Cycling spokesman also followed suit, saying: \u201cWe\u2019re proud of our strong anti-doping culture at British Cycling.

If no other offences were committed in that time the fine would be discharged.</p> <p>However, Ruth Barson, who has worked with Dhu\u2019s family in her role as the director of legal advocacy with the Human Rights Law Centre, said the proposed changes were a half-measure.</p> <p>Dhu\u2019s family has campaigned since her death for an end to jailing people for fines and for the introduction of a custody notification system.</p> <p>\u201cIf the Barnett government was committed to reducing the number of vulnerable and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people being locked up for fine default then they just need to change the fines legislation itself to make it far more flexible,\u201d Barson told Guardian Australia.</p> <p>She said the legislation did not account for resource shortfalls in rural and regional WA, which could limit sentencing options, and said WA should emulate the \u201cexcellent blueprint\u201d of New South Wales, which stopped using jail time to \u201ccut out\u201d fines in 1996.</p> <p>It is the second major change announced since the premier, Colin Barnett, publically promised Dhu\u2019s mother, Della Roe, that he would address the issues that led to her death.</p> <p>The first, extending the Aboriginal visitors scheme to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/feb/19/indigenous-prisoners-in-police-custody-get-24-hour-counselling-hotline\">a 24-hour hotline</a> available to Indigenous people imprisoned in police cells, was also a \u201cB-grade\u201d system, Barson said.</p> <p>In that case, Dhu\u2019s family and Indigenous advocates had been calling for WA to introduce a formal custody notification system (CNS), again following a NSW model, which would impose a mandatory requirement on police to contact the Aboriginal Legal Service any time they held an Indigenous person in custody.

  "<p>Cristiano Ronaldo and Hope Solo are \u2013 how shall we say this politely? \u2013 divisive characters in world football.

Ronaldo was proved right too, as long as you don\u2019t include beating England in the last 16 as \u201canything\u201d. Which many people wouldn\u2019t.</p> <p>But cheap gags at Roy Hodgson aside, did Ronaldo and Solo - which sounds a bit like an 80s cover band \u2013 have a point? Are today\u2019s football games too easily destroyed by parking the bus and counter-attacking? The answer is simple: yes. The solution, though, is more difficult.</p> <p>And make no mistake: For all the global dollars, euros and pounds that wind up in the hands of Manchester United and Barcelona, a solution is necessary. The internet and the 500-channel universe have given football a larger audience, particularly in the United States where the Premier League now regularly <a href=\"http://www.socceramerica.com/article/68858/tv-report-epl-outdraws-nhl-in-2015-16.html\">draws in bigger viewership that the NHL</a>. But that audience can also be taken away.<br></p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/mar/02/league-1-america-soccer-revolution-never-was\">Gimmicky attempts to jazz up the game</a>, done mostly for an American audience with Fifa\u2019s alternating blessing and scorn, didn\u2019t pay off. The old NASL had a points system that rivaled English county cricket in its complexity and enforced the offside law only in the last 35 yards of the field. The USISL of the early 1990s used a 60-minute countdown clock that stopped when the ball went out of play, along with \u201ckick-ins,\u201d cruel and unusual punishment for fouling too often, and <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/fifa-plan-bigger-goals-1322249.html\">the occasional flirtation with larger goals</a>.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/mar/02/league-1-america-soccer-revolution-never-was\">Three points for a goal?

No one wants to go back to the days of awarding only two points for a win or allowing defenders to play the ball into their own goalkeepers\u2019 safe hands. Yet those tweaks are not enough, especially in an era in which we\u2019ve all realized that to play like Barcelona, you need to be a team like Barcelona.</p> <p>The fundamental problem is space. Twenty-two players on a large rectangle seems to be a good number until the space is condensed by a team playing a high defensive line. Or when a crowd of players are in the box, reducing football to a simple test of one\u2019s ability to leap while shoving just enough to avoid a whistle.</p> <p>With all due respect to the recent set of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/jan/08/kickoffs-backwards-rule-changes\">changes to the laws of the game</a>, highlighted by the newfound legality of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/jan/08/kickoffs-backwards-rule-changes\">taking a kick-off backwards</a>, it\u2019s time for something more radical.</p> <p>Such as \u2026</p> <p><strong>Smaller numbers on set pieces</strong>. One reason teams can park the bus is that traffic in front of goal is so congested on corner kick and free kicks in an opponent\u2019s half. If teams were limited \u2013 say, five to six players per team in the box until the ball is cleared \u2013 attacking players would have more space, and defensive players would have more of a challenge. Teams could nominate whoever they want to go into the box so fans would still get the thrill of seeing their keeper sprint up the pitch for a rubbish header in the final seconds of a cup tie.</p> <p><strong>Farewell, offside.</strong> Interpretation of Law 11 <a href=\"http://www.skysports.com/football/news/11095/9930438/the-offside-rule-change-explained-with-the-help-of-a-referee\">has evolved over the years</a>. Now, we\u2019re told \u201ceven is on.\u201d But it\u2019s still far too easy for a defensive line to compress the field. The law\u2019s supporters say defenders are free to join the attack without having to worry about an opposing forward lurking 70 yards down the field, but when the defense press forward, we can end up with 20 or so mobile players in a congested area. And then the outcome of a game may hinge on the split-second decision of an assistant referee who surely could do better things than stare at the second-to-last defender for 90 minutes.</p> <p>Which leads to this \u2026</p> <p><strong>More eyes off the ball</strong>. The NFL <a href=\"http://operations.nfl.com/the-officials/these-officials-are-really-good/officials-responsibilities-positions/\">has several officials</a> who watch for fouls away from the ball. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Official_(basketball)\">Basketball has three officials</a> for 10 players.

Some suggestions:</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2015/jun/05/breaking-the-law-why-fifa-should-relax-its-eligibility-rules\">Breaking the Law: why Fifa should relax its eligibility rules | Scott Murray</a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong>Passivity penalty</strong>. Each team will be required to register a legitimate shot on goal at least once every 30 minutes. Failure to do so is punished by the removal of one player. The referee wouldn\u2019t issue a red card \u2013 so players aren\u2019t suspended for a collective failing \u2013 but the manager of the offending (or over-defending) team would be obliged to take off one player. We\u2019ll need to define a shot too \u2013 possibly a ball that is either on target or within six yards either side of the goal \u2013 to prevent players from just taking a speculative whiff from 50 yards out every few minutes.</p> <p>Those are game-by-game solutions. A few other ideas are dependent on the type of competition.</p> <p><strong>League play:</strong> Deduct points. Each time a team attempts fewer than eight shots in a game, it\u2019s a warning. The third warning is a one-point deduction. The fifth warning is a two-point deduction. And so on. Until your team is relegated on minus-98 points.</p> <p><strong>Tournament play:</strong> Revamp extra time. If a game remains tied after extra time, the team that attempts the most shots in the added period is declared the winner. A team may still park the bus for 90 minutes, but sometime in the next 30, they needs to get that bus in gear. If teams are level on shots, it goes to penalties just to make England unhappy. Yes, you may see teams doing whatever they can to take or prevent shots. That simply adds another dimension to the game and makes the tiebreaker something other than the test of nerves and luck of the traditional kicks from the penalty spot.</p> <p>And if all else fails, boo. Complain. Gripe. Writers, should stop hailing the \u201cbrave defense\u201d of an overmatched team that makes little effort to play an entertaining game. Fans, create tifo ridiculing negative opponents.</p> <p>Perhaps that\u2019ll remind coaches and players that their massive salaries are dependent on people who have other options to spend their money on. And if they keep on treating the beautiful game as a dour exercise in cranking out results, we\u2019ll all be watching and playing lacrosse or ultimate frisbee in another couple of decades.</p>",
  "<p>The prime minister, Theresa May, tops the list of 50 most powerful people in UK higher education this year. </p> <p>Published by <a href=\"http://wonkhe.com/\">Wonkhe</a> \u2013 a thinktank for higher education policy \u201cwonks\u201d \u2013 the list is dominated by politicians, but includes the vice-chancellors, journalists and thinkers who are making the most impact on the sector.</p> <p>Wonkhe editor Mark Leach says: \u201cThere is, of course, no scientific way to measure power. Our judging discussions had two overriding themes: who has the power to allocate resources and make the rules? And who is active and effective at trying to influence this? </p> <p>\u201cMany of the figures work day-in, day-out in our sector. Others may give very little thought to the world of UK universities \u2013 but they make the massive decisions that shape the world in which British higher education must operate.\u201d</p> <h2>Top 10 on the power list</h2> <p>(with commentary from Wonkhe)</p> <h2>1 Theresa May, prime minister</h2> <p>As home secretary, May was loathed by universities thanks to her dogged determination to restrict international student recruitment and her zealous implementation of anti-terror legislation. May has previously declared her pride in standing up to university lobbyists on these matters, and said she believes universities need to reform their business models to lessen their dependence on foreign recruitment. Fresh policy being driven from No.10 could have far-reaching consequences for the sector, such as a new wave of grammar schools, and compelling universities to open their own schools. The new PM will define the post-Brexit climate in which higher education institutions will have to learn to operate. </p> <h2><strong>2 Angela Merkel, Germany\u2019s chancellor </strong></h2> <p>As one of the most influential people on the planet, Angela Merkel scores very highly on this year\u2019s list. The terms of the UK\u2019s exit will have to be approved by the European Union\u2019s member states, but nothing will be agreed without the consent of Germany. We should expect her to play a key role in the negotiating lines for the UK\u2019s exit of the EU, and subsequent deal-making. Bundestag elections will next take place in 2017 and Merkel is said to be politically vulnerable. So this could be a make-or-break year for the quantum-chemist-turned-politician. </p> <h2><strong>3 David Davis and Oliver Robbins, secretary of state and permanent secretary for exiting the European Union</strong></h2> <p>The men running the first ever UK government department to include a present continuous verb literally hold the keys to the kingdom in their hands. It\u2019s a vastly complicated task, and the highly-regarded Oliver Robbins will play a critical role at every twist and turn. The sector has already been in to see the pair and state their case. David Davis has never showed a great deal of interest in universities, and hasn\u2019t given much away yet. But it is in his power to put universities at the centre of a sustainable deal \u2013 or to set up a post-Brexit horror show. </p> <h2><strong>4 Carlos Moedas, EU commissioner for research, innovation and science </strong></h2> <p> Moedas will have considerable influence over the finer points of higher education policy during Brexit, and the sector will need to make representations to him to get a good post-Brexit deal with the European research community. Moedas has already been in close communication with Jo Johnson about the status of Horizon 2020 projects involving British researchers, and although he\u2019s offered some reassurance, little action has been taken so far. </p> <h2><strong>5 Philip Hammond, chancellor of the exchequer </strong></h2> <p>A sober public image has led to the chancellor being labelled \u201can accountant\u201d, but his background is actually in entrepreneurial business, and Hammond was not shy about taking risks. A post-Brexit reset of UK fiscal policy will have a massive impact on higher education. Hammond has hinted that austerity and his predecessor\u2019s fiscal targets may be tweaked or abandoned, and his upcoming autumn statement is hotly anticipated. Hammond is thought to be arguing for a Brexit settlement that maintains as much of the single market as is possible, which should make him an ally for the sector\u2019s broader interests.</p> <h2><strong>6 Xi Jinping, president of China </strong></h2> <p>The growing importance of China to UK higher education (and indeed the wider economy) will be accelerated by Brexit, particularly if there is a decline in EU student numbers. Several UK universities now have campuses in China, including Liverpool and Nottingham. In 2008-09, one in five new international students came from China. In 2012-13, it was one in three. Around a quarter of postgraduate taught students are Chinese. The growing success of China\u2019s own universities in global rankings is also a significant competition area for UK universities. Xi Jinping\u2019s state visit to the UK last year saw the red carpet enthusiastically rolled out by UK universities who were desperate to impress the Chinese premier. Amid the pomp and ceremony, it was excruciatingly clear that the Chinese felt that they represented the stronger side of a global partnership.</p> <h2><strong>7 Jo Johnson, minister for universities, science, research and innovation </strong></h2> <p>On his appointment, the sector was pleased that a well-connected and wonkish politician was chosen to represent it. Few anticipated the zeal with which he would take forward a series of reforms that are still only in their early stages, including the paradigm-shifting Teaching Excellence Framework which has been dominating the policy debate. Since the reshuffle, he has to divide his time between two departments and teams, and has been stripped of his own special adviser. He will be judged on his ability to resist Theresa May and Amber Rudd\u2019s mindless assault on universities\u2019 ability to recruit international students and to ensure the best possible deal for universities and science in the Brexit negotiations. <strong><br></strong></p> <h2><strong>8 Justine Greening, secretary of state for education </strong></h2> <p>The first openly LGBT woman to serve in the cabinet, and the first education secretary to attend a comprehensive school, Greening was welcomed as a safe pair of hands after Michael Gove and Nicky Morgan. The return of higher and further education to the Department for Education puts her in a powerful position. She will be the arbiter in fights for funding between schools, universities and colleges, particularly if the Treasury begins trimming the department\u2019s budget. Greening is a close ally of the prime minister and is tasked with planning the reintroduction of grammar schools.<strong><br></strong></p> <h2><strong>9 John Kingman, chair, UK Research and Innovation </strong></h2> <p>Recently appointed as the inaugural chair, John Kingman\u2019s already-high stock in the sector is rising further. When UKRI is fully operational, it will have a budget of over \u00a36bn per year. He\u2019ll be combining his UKRI role with that of chairman of Legal &amp; General Group. <strong><br></strong></p> <h2><strong>10 Greg Clark, secretary of state for business, energy, and industrial strategy</strong></h2> <p>Clark finds himself higher up this year\u2019s list thanks to his wide-ranging new role. It\u2019s not only the research and science policy buck that stops at his desk \u2013 his mandate to create a new industrial strategy for the UK could have far-reaching consequences for universities. Many in the sector are pinning their hopes on the strategy mitigating some of the worst effects of Brexit, so the stakes couldn\u2019t be higher. </p> <h2>The top VCs</h2> <p>University leaders also feature prominently on the power list, particularly vice-chancellors who take the most active roles outside of their own institutions. </p> <p>Leach comments: \u201cSome, such as Leszek Borysiewicz, Steve Smith and David Eastwood, are veteran \u2018big beasts\u2019 of the sector who have had multiple leadership roles in the world of education, science and research. Others, such as Ian Diamond and Anton Muscatelli, have taken an active role in a specific area of government policy. Finally, there are the \u2018rising stars\u2019, a new generation of vice chancellors who recognise the importance of being active in public life, such as Janet Beer.\u201d </p> <p><strong>Here are the top 10 VCs and their rankings:</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"0f946bd1486f78f200c31e657cc723d0fb410ca0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0f946bd1486f78f200c31e657cc723d0fb410ca0/734_560_3798_2279/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Prof Sir Leszek Borysiewicz, vice chancellor of Cambridge University\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Professor Sir Leszek Borysiewicz.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Felix Clay/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Leszek Borysiewicz, University of Cambridge (15)<br>Ian Diamond, University of Aberdeen (20)<br>Anton Muscatelli, University of Glasgow (21)<br>Louise Richardson, University of Oxford (22)<br>David Eastwood, University of Birmingham (25)<br>Steve Smith, University of Exeter (26)<br>David Bell, University of Reading (29)<br>Janet Beer, University of Liverpool (31)<br>Anthony Seldon, University of Buckingham (35)<br>Julia Goodfellow, University of Kent (37)</p> <p><em>The full list of 50 is available <a href=\"http://wonkhe.com/\">on the Wonkhe site </a></em></p>",
  "<p>People often say they couldn\u2019t do my job. I frequently wonder how I do. There are times I dread going in, times I can\u2019t sleep at night because I\u2019m worrying about a patient and days where I can laugh and cry intermittently. Every day feels like a gamble working as a community mental health nurse, not knowing what to expect.<br></p> <p>Take Friday as an example. My diary was packed. Any sensible community nurse knows to keep this day as free as possible.

Two police officers arrive as I explain to them the seriousness of the threats Adam has made while describing a worrying relapse in his mental state.

With some reluctance, they finally agree to go to the addresses we provide, but as they have no powers of arrest, we need to arrange an emergency assessment.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video element--supporting\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/video/2016/sep/11/nhs-providers-chief-executive-under-greatest-pressure-generations-health-hospitals-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/52gck\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2708579\"            data-video-name=\"NHS Providers chief executive: \u2018We are under the greatest pressure in generations\u2019 \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"BBC The Andrew Marr Show\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-57d5272de4b07ac3d446b045\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/09/11/160911MarrNHS_1_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/09/11/160911MarrNHS_1.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/09/11/160911MarrNHS_1_V5.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/video/2016/sep/11/nhs-providers-chief-executive-under-greatest-pressure-generations-health-hospitals-video\">NHS Providers chief executive: \u2018We are under the greatest pressure in generations\u2019</a></figcaption> </figure>   <h2>12pm</h2> <p>My phone is going wild, my anxiety through the roof.

It drops the $500,000 lifetime cap and makes a number of other changes while still reining in some of the more generous tax concessions. Financial services minister Kelly O\u2019Dwyer did a lot of the backbench negotiating while Scott Morrison did the shoulder charging. Both ministers challenged Labor to support the changes in question time but Chris Bowen was not ready to approve it. Labor of course have their own package which does broadly similar things. But given the Coalition tried to sneak a few other measures into the budget omnibus bill, he wants to see the fine print first. <br></strong></li> <li><strong>The super compromise was a win for government but it still has to pass the parliament and that needs Labor\u2019s support. But the win did increase Coalition confidence in question time, as evidenced by Mike Bowers photos. Turnbull rejected the characterisation as a backflip, saying policies needed to change and respond to circumstances. He said the government would consider ideas from any quarter, even Labor. Leader of government business, Christopher Pyne followed up, saying the Labor\u2019s divisive rhetoric was so last parliament. Remember that one under Tony Abbott?<br></strong></li> <li><strong>The budget omnibus bill went to the Senate today and after the motion by Labor and the Coalition to extend the hours for the day, senators will be forced to sit until the bill passes. The Greens are objecting mightily, having wanted to get the bill to a Senate inquiry. <br></strong></li> <li><strong>Attorney general George Brandis will have to submit to a Senate inquiry into the circumstances around his direction that any requests for legal advice from the solicitor general must come through his office. This will be a very interesting fishing exercise.<br></strong></li> <li><strong>Bill Shorten is still in Canada with Justin. Trudeau, not Beiber. </strong><br></li> </ul> <p>That\u2019s it from me.

Labor\u2019s superannuation package, which was released by <strong>Chris Bowen</strong> a fair while before the Coalition\u2019s package, should also be congratulated. Bowen essentially gave Morrison cover to work up superannuation reforms which could make a difference to the budget and get rid of a significant tax shelter. As Morrison said, people were stacking money into balances up to $100m paying no tax. Larf! </p> <p>Now you could say, Morrison should have run it past his own backbench before the budget to make for a neater policy package. It certainly would have saved a bit of angst and removed a stick for <strong>Eric Abetz</strong>. But hey, the broader point remains. If the generous concessions for largely high-income earners are wound back for the good of the budget and the savings figures are correct, <strong>Morrison and Turnbull done good</strong>. (All nuclear explosions kept to the comments thread, please.)</p> <p>Bowen will be out at midday. Morrison says he has spoken to him.

I live in a small town and live among some people who for various reasons share some of the views of <strong>Pauline Hanson</strong>. Some vote for her.</p> <p>I heard those views just prior to Hanson winning a seat in 1996. I had just moved out of the city and at that time, she was an anathema to me because I considered her and her supporters ignorant.

They have issues which they want to see ventilated and putting a lid on them will not make them go away. Conversations help.</p> <p>But there is a difference between then and now, though the messages are similar. I covered that 1996 speech when she said Indigenous Australians were getting special benefits and we were being swamped by Asians. Now we are being swamped by Muslims, who are taking benefits, and the Asians, having done too well, are buying all our land.

I predict the Sudanese will come into focus in the future.<br></p> <p>The difference as I see it is this. In 1996, Hanson was unformed, politically naive, channelling views she heard in her family and in her community. The political process and Svengalis got a hold of her, chucked her in jail for a bit and she has emerged out the other side a different person. Strategic. Polished. That speech last night was a result. Deliberately hitting the same notes but choosing different victims. Smirking as the Greens staged their ill-advised walkout. As <strong>Tony Burke</strong> said she is not dumb, this was a deliberate, damaging, illogical but incendiary intervention. As much as I railed in 1996, I prefer that version. Pauline Hanson 2.0, in this security environment, has much more capacity for damage. </p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-09-14T23:42:34.389Z\">at 12.42am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57d9cf64e4b067ad30087c9e\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-14T22:36:37.144Z\">11.36pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>If you are looking around for powerful first speeches, check this one out.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muNKv2QttTY\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/muNKv2QttTY?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>Julian Leeser, new MP for Berowra, gives his first speech.</figcaption> </figure>   <p>Leeser won the safe Liberal seat after <strong>Philip Ruddock</strong> retired. </p> <p>It\u2019s the personal experiences I think which shape the best first speeches.

Her comments don\u2019t make Australia stronger or safer, or Australia a more cohesive society.</p> </blockquote> <p>Wong made the point that if Hanson had been around in the 1950s or 60s she would have targeted Greeks and Italians, then eastern Europeans, then Asians in the 1990s, and today Muslims. </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I think diversity is a strength.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Nick Xenophon</strong> said the way Hanson had \u201cvilified\u201d Islamic Australians was \u201cheart-breaking\u201d.<br></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>This is not what Australia is about \u2013 we are an open, inclusive country.

  "<p>The European Union\u2019s trade negotiators are due to meet their US counterparts on Thursday amid growing speculation that talks over the <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/jul/03/what-is-ttip-controversial-trade-deal-explained\">Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership</a> have ground to a halt.</p> <p>The European commission\u2019s trade chief, Cecilia Malmstr\u00f6m, will meet US trade ambassador Michael Froman in a bid to rescue the TTIP talks at a meeting in Brussels on Thursday described as a \u201cstocktake\u201d of the negotiations so far.</p> <p>The two sides are understood to be preparing to put the talks on the back burner while policymakers consider complaints about a similar and equally controversial EU trade deal with Canada.</p> <p>The comprehensive economic and trade agreement (CETA) deal with Canada is due to be ratified by the council of ministers next month prior to being debated by the Strasbourg parliament. But protests in Germany, France and Finland could wreck the agreement and with it the prospects for the TTIP talks.</p> <p>A gathering in Germany of SPD members next week at a special congress could force the left-of-centre party\u2019s leadership to reverse its support for CETA, and trigger widespread revolt across the continent against the deal and its cousin TTIP. </p> <p>Last month Sigmar Gabriel, the SPD leader and economy minister in Angela Merkel\u2019s coalition government, said that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/29/eu-trade-negotiator-talks-down-ttip-failure-report-sigmar-gabriel\">\u201cin my opinion, the negotiations with the US have de facto failed</a>, even though nobody is really admitting it\u201d, though he remains a supporter of the CETA deal.</p> <p>EU officials believe the ailing European economy can only recover with the help of trade deals that harmonise rules and regulations, making it easier to sell goods and services abroad.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>A spokesman for the commission said it was aiming to strike a comprehensive deal with the US. </p> <p>He said: \u201cSince the beginning of this year there has been a intensification of contact between negotiators, both at technical and political level.\u201d</p> <p>He denied that negotiators were shedding controversial elements of the talks to secure a deal before the US president, Barack Obama, leaves office at the end of the year.</p> <p>\u201cA quick deal would likely be a scaled down deal that would not include meaningful outcomes for most of the EU\u2019s interests. That would mean far fewer benefits for EU citizens. It is in the EU\u2019s interest that substance prevails over deadlines,\u201d he said.</p> <p>But Jude Kirton-Darling, Labour MEP for north-east England and a member of the European parliament\u2019s trade committee, said the political arm-twisting needed to secure the CETA deal could spell the end for TTIP.</p> <p>\u201cTTIP has been stalled for months, and [Thursday\u2019s] meeting is merely a face-saving exercise for both the US and the EU. Political attention in Europe is now really focused on the finalised EU-Canada CETA deal, due to be ratified in the coming months, which up to now has been subject to less public scrutiny but raises many of the same concerns around standards, public services and the rule of law,\u201d she said.</p> <p>\u201cLoud public declarations from EU leaders and their opposition to TTIP in recent weeks can only be understood in the context of growing public discontent over the CETA deal. TTIP\u2019s life support machine will be turned off if doing so helps to secure a majority in favour of CETA.\u201d</p> <p>TTIP has become the focus of anti-globalisation protests in the US and Europe with both presidential candidates, Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump, accusing the Obama administration of promoting a trade deal that would cost jobs and drive down wages.<br></p> <p>The European commission has come under intense pressure to abandon the talks following protests across Europe against provisions that campaigners argue will allow US companies to demand access to public sector contracts. Opponents have also complained that a separate courts system to resolve trade disputes will allow corporations to sue governments when new laws restrict their ability to make profits.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Malmstr\u00f6m has overhauled the investor-state dispute settlement (ISDS) system used in most trade deals, which anti-TTIP campaigners have described as a secretive courts process for the sole benefit of multinational corporations. She has proposed a more transparent version, which has retrospectively been inserted into the CETA agreement.</p> <p>The anti-poverty charity Global Justice Now has described <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/ttip\">TTIP</a> as having \u201clittle to do with selling more products\u201d and being \u201cmore <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/may/20/david-cameron-support-ttip\">a charter for deregulation</a>, which threatens to change the way we make decisions about laws\u201d.</p> <p>This week Alfred de Zayas, the United Nations independent expert on the promotion of a democratic and equitable international order, called for all future trade agreements to \u201cstipulate the primacy of human rights\u201d in a clear reference to the private courts systems included in TTIP and CETA deals. </p> <p>He said existing treaties should be revised to ensure that they did not conflict with the duty of government to fulfil binding human rights treaties and meet environmental and health goals. <br> </p>",
  "<blockquote> <p>I\u2019m thinking of replacing my <a href=\"http://www.gsmarena.com/huawei_ascend_y300-5386.php\">Huawei Y300</a> smartphone, which is about three years old now. I was wondering about buying a second-hand phone. I believe you save a considerable amount of money buying hardware behind the curve. Until now, I\u2019ve bought most hardware new. Are there any dos and don\u2019ts when buying second hand? <strong tabindex=\"-1\">Robert</strong></p> </blockquote> <p>You can save money by buying new smartphones that are \u201cbehind the curve\u201d \u2013 Amazon often has deals on new phones at close to used prices. Otherwise, the savings on second-hand phones may be offset by the extra work you have to do, and the extra risks. The savings may be wiped out if your phone fails, or turns out to be stolen.</p> <p>There are actually two types of second-hand phone. The first is the usual type, sold by individuals and some small dealers. The second type consists of refurbished phones, which have been tested, fixed and graded by retailers. Refurbished phones should always come with a guarantee, though you may only get six months.</p> <p>Buying a refurbished phone reduces the risks involved, but generally raises the prices.</p> <h2><strong>Refurbishers</strong></h2> <p>O2\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.o2.co.uk/shop/like-new\">Like New</a> online store should be one of the safest places to buy refurbished. The first catch is that O2\u2019s smartphones come with a sim and a contract, but <a href=\"https://www.o2.co.uk/shop/phones/?contractType=payasyougo#condition=likenew&amp;sort=content.sorting.featured\">Simply Pay As You Go</a> doesn\u2019t involve a monthly fee. The second catch is that you can only choose from a small number of phones. The third catch is that <a href=\"http://www.o2.co.uk/refresh\">O2 Refresh</a> offers low prices if you trade in your existing phone.</p> <p>There are other sources of refurbished phones including eBay and <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/SIM-Free-Mobile-Phones-Smartphones-Second-Hand/s\">Amazon</a> traders, and CeX and similar stores. There\u2019s a list on the Money Saving Expert page, <a href=\"http://www.moneysavingexpert.com/phones/buying-refurbished-phones\">Buying a refurbished mobile</a></p> <p>If you buy from a refurbisher, you will usually be able to use a credit card for payment, except on eBay. If your second hand smartphone costs more than \u00a3100, you will get extra protection if something goes wrong.</p> <h2><strong>Checking a phone</strong></h2> <p>If you buy from an individual, you must check that the smartphone works correctly, and that it isn\u2019t stolen. Warn sellers in advance: they may spare you the effort by selling to someone less savvy.</p> <p>This approach depends on meeting the seller face to face, rather than buying sight-unseen from eBay, Gumtree or whatever. It also depends on you having the right size sim for the phone you want to buy, but you can always pick up a cheap one.</p> <p>You should obviously check the smartphone for scratches and other damage, including corrosion around the sockets. Check the camera lens for scratches. If the back opens, get the seller to open it: the smartphone should be clean inside.</p> <p>Take along a laptop, a charging cable, earbuds or headphones, and \u2013 if necessary \u2013 a microSD or SD card. Plug the smartphone into your laptop to make sure it charges. Check that the headphone jack and card slot work. Use your own sim to make a phone call.</p> <p>If the smartphone is locked to a particular network, it should be cheaper than an unlocked phone. Even if you happen to use the same network, do some research first, to make sure you can unlock it.</p> <h2><strong>Secret codes and apps</strong></h2> <p>Most if not all phones have \u201chidden codes\u201d that provide access to extra information and self-test routines. For example, on some Android phones, *#*#4636#*#* will provide usage statistics and battery information, while *#*#0*#*#* will run an LCD display test. I got both these codes from a post at <a href=\"http://www.redmondpie.com/hidden-android-secret-codes-for-samsung-htc-motorola-sony-lg-and-other-devices/\">Redmond Pie</a>, and many others are demonstrated in various <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyQvMAKZ6qI\">YouTube videos</a>. You can search in advance for the codes you need.</p> <p>An alternative is to run an app such as <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mtorres.phonetester\">Phone Tester</a> for Android or <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.idea.PhoneDoctorPlus\">Phone Doctor Plus</a> for Android and Apple\u2019s iOS. These will tell you about the actual smartphone hardware, whether the sensors work, and something about the state of the battery. The healthier the battery, the better \u2013 especially if it\u2019s sealed in the case.</p> <h2><strong>Is it stolen?</strong></h2> <p>Every phone has a unique IMEI (International Mobile Equipment Identity) number, which it sends to the mobile network operator when you turn it on. It\u2019s a string of 15 or 16 digits. It\u2019s usually found on the outside of the box the phone came in, and it will be printed somewhere on or inside the phone, eg under the battery.</p> <p>The IMEI should also be listed somewhere in the smartphone settings, eg under \u201cAbout device\u201d on Android. If not, typing *#06# should show it on the screen.</p> <p>Once you have the IMEI, you can find out the phone\u2019s history. The prime source is the <a href=\"https://www.checkmend.com/uk/\">CheckMEND Mobile Equipment National Database</a>, which claims to be \u201cthe world\u2019s largest source of used mobile phone and device history, including data from police, insurers, retailers and networks.\u201d Unfortunately, it\u2019s not free. A single history report costs \u00a31.99, but you can get them for less if you open an account.</p> <p>There\u2019s a more expensive but possibly more convenient way to access CheckMEND. Send an <a href=\"https://www.checkmend.com/uk/sms-mobile-checking\">SMS text message</a> to 83010 with the word CHECK followed by your IMEI followed by your email address. This costs \u00a33 plus your standard network rate.</p> <p>CheckMEND also runs a <a href=\"https://www.checkmend.com/uk/safe-seller\">Safe Seller</a> scheme with UK police forces. Second hand phone retailers can sign up to get 25 free IMEI searches and a Safe Seller window sticker, among other things.</p> <p>A few sites will check IMEI numbers for nothing. For example, try the <a href=\"http://www.imeipro.info/\">Free international IMEI blacklist checker</a> or the Australian <a href=\"http://www.amta.org.au/pages/amta/Check.the.Status.of.your.Handset\">AMTA</a> website.</p> <h2><strong>What\u2019s a fair price?</strong></h2> <p>Second-hand smartphone prices are set by the market, so the best thing you can do is compare prices and see if there is a consensus. Useful websites include <a href=\"http://www.smartfonestore.com/\">Smartphone Store.com</a>, <a href=\"http://www.cashgenerator.co.uk/mobile-phones\">Cash Generator</a>, <a href=\"http://www.preloved.co.uk/adverts/list/3600/mobile-phones.html?keyword=unlocked+smartphones+for+sale\">Preloved</a> and, of course, <a href=\"http://www.ebay.co.uk/sch/Mobile-Smart-Phones/9355/bn_450671/i.html\">eBay</a>. If you use eBay, it\u2019s important to click \u201cUK only\u201d (or wherever) and to show only \u201csold listings\u201d. This will tell you the prices things actually sold for locally, not the often-silly prices demanded.</p> <p>Bear in mind that the price depends on the condition of the product. Something sold as BNIB (brand new in box) is going to fetch a lot more than the beat-up version some careless user has kept with his keys and dropped every week.</p> <p>I think a fair price is one that makes both people happy. There\u2019s no point in trying to rip someone off for a few quid because you may want to contact the seller later, either for advice or because something has gone wrong.</p> <p><strong>Have you got another question for Jack?

  "<p>The morning after the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/eu-referendum\" title=\"\">EU referendum</a> was not, for progressives, like the morning after any other defeat. It wasn\u2019t just depressing, but disorienting. For Remainers used to thinking of themselves as the sensible mainstream the result was a rude shock. They hadn\u2019t just lost, they were lost in a country they no longer recognised. People clearly weren\u2019t thinking what they were thinking, after all.</p> <p>And so, many will be drawn to the upbeat title of this book, with its can-do suggestion that actually there\u2019s still a huge market for progressive parties if only they can get their act together.</p> <p>The idea for a cross-party collection of essays stems from <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/general-election-2015\" title=\"\">election night 2015</a>, when the Green MP <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/carolinelucas\" title=\"\">Caroline Lucas </a>and her Liberal Democrat opponent Chris Bowers were chatting at their Brighton count about the futility of fighting each other when they actually agreed on so much.</p> <p>A few months later they joined forces with the rising Labour star <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/lisa-nandy\" title=\"\">Lisa Nandy</a> to produce this book, arguing not for a&#xa0;merger of their three parties, or even a formal electoral pact, but more cautiously for making common cause wherever possible. Why split the anti-Tory vote between them when, they suggest, the differences between many Labour, Lib Dem and Green candidates \u201care far smaller than the differences between figures who are at home in the Conservative party?\u201d</p> <p>That would be easier to swallow, perhaps, if Labour weren\u2019t currently tearing itself in two over some of these supposedly small differences. Ironically, Nandy quit the front bench rather than work with <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/jeremy-corbyn\" title=\"\">Jeremy Corbyn</a> in the very month this book was written.</p> <p>But the prospect of a Labour split does, in a sense, add fresh urgency to the argument. Some Corbynites would clearly rather work with Greens, nationalists and fringe socialist parties than with the dreaded Blairites; some on the Labour right wonder if they now have more in common with centrists in other parties. Could there be an earthquake coming \u2013 a grand redrawing of the political map?</p> <p>There are some highly readable essays here. Skim readers should skip straight to <a href=\"https://www.chathamhouse.org/expert/duncan-brack\" title=\"\">Duncan Brack</a>\u2019s practical account of lessons learned from Tony Blair and Paddy Ashdown\u2019s efforts to forge a Lib-Lab pact in the 90s. The SNP MPs <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/mhairi-black\" title=\"\">Mhairi Black</a> and <a href=\"http://www.snp.org/chris_law\" title=\"\">Chris Law</a> shed interesting light on sticky relations with Labour at Westminster.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/yasminalibhaibrown\" title=\"\">Yasmin Alibhai-Brown</a>\u2019s argument that the left has for the best of reasons failed to call out unacceptable beliefs and practices in ethnic minority communities is the best-written polemic in&#xa0;the book, whether you agree with it or not. True progressives, she argues, should operate without fear and favour \u2013 which means demanding that white liberals integrate better, too: \u201c<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/davidcameron\" title=\"\">David Cameron</a> talked about racial integration, but how many Asians get invited to his house?\u201d</p> <p>And while there\u2019s no set progressive manifesto, some common themes do emerge: electoral reform to help smaller progressive parties, a basic universal income that might compensate for technology destroying low-skilled jobs, a shorter working week and a shift towards prioritising happiness over economic growth. An essay from the <a href=\"http://www.newweather.org/\" title=\"\">New Weather Institute</a>\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.newweather.org/about-us/david-boyle/\" title=\"\">David Boyle</a>, arguing that the left should be proposing new ways of creating prosperity rather than just demonstrating that it \u201cknows how to share it around\u201d, meanwhile provides a necessary counterpoint to some more utopian contributions.</p> <p>But the most important chapter here is probably the one many readers won\u2019t like, in which the pollster <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/john-curtice\" title=\"\">John Curtice</a> runs briskly through the electoral maths. As he writes, almost half the nation voted for broadly progressive parties in 2015 (49% backed Labour, the LibDems, Greens, SNP or Plaid Cymru, while 51% chose the Tories or Ukip). But it\u2019s not as simple as concluding that first-past-the-post has cheated half the nation out of the liberal-left government it secretly wanted. Drill deeper and there\u2019s worryingly little support for many of the assumptions made elsewhere in the book \u2013 for example, spending more on benefits even if it means higher taxes. Almost two-thirds of voters think ordinary people don\u2019t enjoy a fair share of national wealth, yet only 40% favour redistribution from richer to poorer. Most think people should use their cars less for the sake of the planet \u2013 but when asked if they personally are willing to drive less, a majority aren\u2019t. People like \u201cwhat we might call the \u2018sentiment\u2019 of progressivism\u201d, Curtice writes, but balk at what it means in practice. As for electoral reform to make every vote count, voters rejected that idea in a referendum just five years ago.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>This barely addresses the gap between what voters are thinking and what progressives would like them to be thinking</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>And the yawning hole in this book is that it barely addresses this awkward gap between what voters are thinking and what progressives would like them to be thinking. Brexit may have come too late for the authors to reflect on, but progressive ideas took a pasting in May 2015 too, and the book doesn\u2019t seem very interested in asking why.</p> <p>The awkward reality hinted at in Curtice\u2019s essay is that in Britain, progressives often struggle to get into government unless they hitch themselves to larger movements and identities. Labour has prospered by uniting progressive liberals, often middle class and urban, with a more socially conservative working-class movement. Tory modernisers thrived only by convincing traditional Conservatives to play along. The SNP blends progressive policies with identity politics. There are endless ways to make up the numbers, but growing big enough to govern usually involves compromises between those impatient for progress and those lagging behind; yet this book largely ignores the challenge posed by the latter.</p> <p>Labour could add votes \u2013 although analysis suggests not enough to win a&#xa0;general election \u2013 by wooing Green voters, but the positions they\u2019d strike to do so risk alienating others. Does anyone really imagine Labour voters who want to keep Trident, cut immigration, and who aren\u2019t much interested in civil liberties have nowhere else to go? It\u2019s not as simple as mentally shifting Green voters in marginal seats from one box to another, and assuming nothing else changes \u2013 and even if it were, scope&#xa0;for tactical voting is always limited by voters\u2019 often deep attachments to their original tribes.</p> <p>The authors are right to point out the madness of people who fundamentally agree on so much yet are scrapping over what looks like nothing. But if progressives aren\u2019t careful, dreams of reuniting the left can become a place to hide from reality; a means of wishing away awkward truths about what voters think, and ducking the need to compromise with your own party. The trouble with collections of essays is that while each can be individually stimulating, they are often too contradictory to cohere into one clear story.

  "<p>The Honor 8 is the latest smartphone from Huawei\u2019s cheaper sub-brand. It\u2019s no longer as cut price as the range used to be, but Huawei has squeezed most of what was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/apr/18/huawei-p9-review-smartphone-leica-camera-fingerprint-scanner-emui-software\">good about its flagship P9</a> smartphone into something that costs almost 20% less. So do you really need to spend more than \u00a3400 for a great phone any more?</p> <h2>Glass is back</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0580ff7aa65043d4c20a2afc43ebdedbf3aa6698\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0580ff7aa65043d4c20a2afc43ebdedbf3aa6698/0_0_3983_2390/1000.jpg\" alt=\"honor 8 review\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The glass back and its varying light reflections making interesting patterns.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The Honor 8 bucks the brand\u2019s trend for metal-bodied phones with a glass front and back and metal around the sides. It\u2019s a simple, attractive design, which feels very solid.</p> <p>The curved metal sides are easy to keep a grip of, thanks to narrow screen bezels, while the back has an attractive layering pattern that reflects light at different angles. The blue version is particularly pretty in sunlight. Shame, then, that you\u2019ll probably want to put it in a protective case to prevent smashing both sides.</p> <p>At 7.5mm thick, the Honor 8 is a slim phone stacking up well compared to similarly-priced competition, including the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/oct/23/google-nexus-5x-review-android-60-marshmallow-smartphone-battery\">7.9mm thick LG Nexus 5X</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/jun/14/oneplus-3-review-flagship-phone-at-mid-range-price\">7.4mm thick OnePlus 3</a>. It\u2019s also of a similar weight but doesn\u2019t have any elements protruding from the back - a rarity for thin smartphones in the last couple of years.</p> <p>The 5.2in screen is good but not spectacular, with highly saturated colours, muted blacks and good viewing angles.</p> <h2>Specifications</h2> <ul> <li><strong>Screen: </strong>5.2in full HD LCD (424ppi)</li> <li><strong>Processor:</strong> Octa-core Huawei Kirin 950</li> <li><strong>RAM: </strong>4GB of RAM</li> <li><strong>Storage: </strong>32GB + microSD card</li> <li><strong>Operating system: </strong>Android 6.0 with Emotion UI 4.1</li> <li><strong>Camera: </strong>12MP dual rear camera, 8MP front-facing camera</li> <li><strong>Connectivity: </strong>LTE, Wi-Fiac, NFC, IR, Bluetooth 4.2, USB-C and GPS</li> <li><strong>Dimensions: </strong>145.5 x 71.0 x 7.5mm</li> <li><strong>Weight:</strong> 153g</li> </ul> <h2>Snappy with pretty good battery life</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cb0054f3981e90655ec010483f343085b480611c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cb0054f3981e90655ec010483f343085b480611c/0_0_4000_2400/1000.jpg\" alt=\"honor 8 review\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Honor 8, powered by Huawei.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The Honor 8 uses Huawei\u2019s octo-core Kirin 950 and has 4GB of RAM, making it a highly capable smartphone, particularly at under \u00a3400.</p> <p>Performance can only be described as snappy, with little in the way of lag visible anywhere, despite Huawei\u2019s heavy modifications to Android \u2013 more on that later. The Honor 8 will be able to handle pretty much anything anyone will likely try and do with it, from gaming to photo editing, without much issue.</p> <p>I also found it held on to a 4G signal better than most other smartphones in weaker network areas, although at the same time it was worse affected by the congested network conditions of London commuter trains, causing a greater battery drain than some other similar smartphones going through the same areas.</p> <p>The phone supports dual-Sims too, but one of the Sim trays can take a microSD card instead, so you either increase the storage capacity or add another phone number or data connection.</p> <p>Overall, battery life was very good, however. I could easily stretch out the battery to two days with little effort. Activating the battery saving modes added further capacity. During a normal work day, with hundreds of push notifications, three hours of wireless music listening, three hours of browsing and using apps, a quick game and the odd photo, I would make it home on the second day with around 10% of battery life left.</p> <h2>EMUI 4.1 Android</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d6478396b4b03487aa6d190eb78e3c622b114779\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d6478396b4b03487aa6d190eb78e3c622b114779/0_0_3294_1977/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Honor 8\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">It looks more or less like a standard Android on first look, but look further and its software feels like an imitation of Apple\u2019s iOS.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The Honor 8 runs Huawei\u2019s version of Android 6 Marshmallow called Emotion UI (EMUI) 4.1.

The notification shade has been changed to a two-panel layout with a timeline-style listing of events, while the overview of recently used apps is flat, sliding carousel of app images, rather than a vertical stack of apps.</p> <p>Along with the visual changes, EMUI has much more aggressive power-saving features, that shuts down problem apps and severely limits what can be active when the screen is off by default.</p> <p>Some of the changes are good, others are a matter of taste, while some make Android less usable.</p> <ul> <li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/apr/18/huawei-p9-review-smartphone-leica-camera-fingerprint-scanner-emui-software\">See the review of the Huawei P9 for a more on EMUI 4.1</a></li> </ul> <h2>Fingerprint scanner</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6ec936da0771e4dc7276c891ba0a714929f9d4af\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6ec936da0771e4dc7276c891ba0a714929f9d4af/0_0_4546_2728/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Honor 8 review\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The fingerprint scanner on the back doubles as a button</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Huawei continues its use of very fast, very accurate fingerprint sensors on the back, which are some of the best in the business and are able to unlock the Honor 8 in a fraction of a second.</p> <p>The fingerprint scanner doubles as a button, which can be customised to do just about anything with a short-, double- and long-press, including launching the Google search app.</p> <h2>Dual camera</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9cc00e14b4efdf867e1782c179289152e9f783a9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9cc00e14b4efdf867e1782c179289152e9f783a9/0_0_3950_2370/1000.jpg\" alt=\"honor 8 review\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Two cameras on the back are better than one, according to Huawei.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The Honor 8 has the same twin 12-megapixel camera set up as the P9 and performance is similar.

Battery life is good, the dual camera setup produces decent shots, the fingerprint scanner is excellent and with 32GB of storage and a microSD card slot, there\u2019s plenty of space for apps, photos and music.</p> <p>The biggest problem with the Honor 8, however, is the software. Huawei\u2019s EMUI is getting better, slowly, but it\u2019s an old version of Android 6 Marshmallow now, and while some may like the look and feel of it, I\u2019m not a big fan.</p> <p>It\u2019s generally less intuitive and more fiddly than the standard Android interface, but does have some powerful power control features. For two-thirds of the price of most top-end smartphones, the Honor 8 is great value and doesn\u2019t feel like a budget phone . It\u2019s just not quite brilliant.</p> <blockquote> <p><strong>Pros:</strong> good battery life, snappy, feels and looks nice, excellent fingerprint scanner, good camera, dual sim, headphone jack, microSD card slot</p> <p><strong>Cons:</strong> back is very slippery, software isn\u2019t as good as the hardware</p> </blockquote> <h2>Other reviews</h2> <ul> <li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/oct/23/google-nexus-5x-review-android-60-marshmallow-smartphone-battery\"><strong>Google Nexus 5X review: the people\u2019s Android phone?</strong></a></li> <li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/aug/27/huawei-honor-7-review-solid-mid-range-with-lightning-fast-fingerprint-scanner\"><strong>Huawei Honor 7 review: solid mid-range with lightning-fast fingerprint scanner</strong></a></li> <li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/jun/14/oneplus-3-review-flagship-phone-at-mid-range-price\"><strong>OnePlus 3 review: flagship phone at mid-range price</strong></a></li> <li><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/mar/11/samsung-galaxy-s7-edge-review-android-smartphone-phablet-marshmallow\">Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge review: this is the smartphone to beat</a></strong></li> </ul> <p><sup><em>Some Guardian articles and galleries contain links to various products and services.

  "<p>My obituary was published when I was 24. It\u2019s a complicated thing to be dead when you\u2019re still very much alive and eager to make a name for yourself. It said I was dead on <a href=\"http://gb.imdb.com/name/nm0231946/\">IMDB</a>, a site that was new when I first died in 1999 \u2013 a time when people still believed everything on the internet was true. It was the marketing department that killed me. The folks at the now-defunct Artisan Pictures bought an odd little midnight offering at Sundance that year called <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/1999/oct/22/4\">The Blair Witch Project</a>, about three film students who go into the woods to make a documentary about said witch and are never heard from again. I was the girl. The girl from The Blair Witch Project. The first line of my obituary.</p> <p>Being dead and alive at the same time has its advantages. I watched a significant time in my life unfurl without me. Who gets to do that? On a brutally hot July day, the 1984 Toyota Celica I bought with my temping pay when I moved to LA overheated (again), only this time it happened under a billboard with my face on it. I sat there, under my enormous face, waiting for the car to cool down, thinking: \u201cSurely this will work out?\u201d When I arrived home that day I did an interview that I\u2019d surreptitiously arranged with my hometown paper, the Philadelphia Inquirer, and shared this story, laughing: \u201cI\u2019m like the poorest new famous person in America!\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/sep/08/bad-omens-blair-witch-omen-ring-carrie-trouble-with-horror-franchise-revival\">Bad omens: Blair Witch and the trouble with the horror franchise revival</a> </p> </aside>  <p>As soon as it ran, I got a call. \u201cYou can\u2019t say things like that,\u201d said the marketing department.</p> <p>\u201cBut it\u2019s true!\u201d I said.</p> <p>\u201cWe need you not to say things like that.\u201d</p> <p>I wanted to say, \u201cWell, are you sending me money?\u201d But I was a 24-year-old actor so I said sorry. The next week I received a fruit basket. The crap kind with pears and water crackers and mostly packaging.</p> <p>As ticket sales began to level off and there was a boost to be gained from the late surprise of: JK! They\u2019re alive! Joshua [Leonard], Mike [Williams] and I were allowed a resurrection. When the time came for us to finally show our faces, the number one question people asked was: \u201cWere you really scared?\u201d If we were not really dead, it was important that we were really scared. People love the safety of horror movies, the controlled anxiety. But this one was supposed to be different. This one was supposed to be real. Williams, Leonard and I did such a convincing job with our acting, improvising, and shooting that the movie went on to make about $250m at the box office \u2013 from a budget of around $75,000.</p> <p>Making the movie was (except for the wet days) a joy. It was as scrappy and punk rock an affair as movie-making could be. The producers skulked about in camouflage with boom boxes blasting children\u2019s voices, they bound blood and teeth in twigs, hung stickmen, dropped notes with the next essential conflict they wanted from us in a milk crate marked with a bicycle flag so we could find it. We went to Denny\u2019s on Halloween after we wrapped and ate in the company of pirates and cats and sexy witches \u2013 the only witches seen during the production. The next year, people were dressed as us.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"577ad9968b783526434dc0f55f633797f3b6a9a8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/577ad9968b783526434dc0f55f633797f3b6a9a8/0_0_1922_1410/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A promotional \u2018missing\u2019 poster used to coincide with the US release of The Blair Witch Project in 1999.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"734\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A promotional \u2018missing\u2019 poster used to coincide with the US release of The Blair Witch Project in 1999.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: William Thomas Cain/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It was the collaborative spirit of production that made my death feel especially violent. It\u2019s a strange thing to get no credit where credit is deeply due. By strange I mean shitty. We were supposed to be really scared, so we weren\u2019t actors (all of us are formally trained). We improvised all dialogue from an outline, but we weren\u2019t writers. We shot it and independently provided the impetus for many of the scenes you see in the film, but we were not directors. While this work became record-breakingly profitable, what we were was dead.</p> <p>The upside of dying early is an early rebirth. I scrapped my LA life in 2007 and moved to a small town in the Sierra Nevada foothills, where people know exactly where they know me from. I was stagnating and I wanted to grow. Being literal-minded, I grew medical marijuana while I figured out what came next. What came next was a return to writing and my memoir of a year growing weed, <a href=\"http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/blair-witch-actress-reveals-real-279503\">Growgirl</a>, came out in 2012. Last year I co-created an independent pilot called <a href=\"http://www.theunion.com/news/16391283-113/tv-pilot-the-high-country-skewers-growing-culture#\">The High Country</a>, a comedy about the underworld of cannabis growing in northern California, (which is way more interesting than Hollywood). I had remade myself. So imagine my surprise when I heard about this <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/sep/12/blair-witch-review-horror-sequel\">new Blair Witch</a>. Dead again, after all.</p> <p>On learning of the sequel, I did what any sensible woman would do and drank very nice bourbon in a very nice bathtub while bawling my eyes out. Nothing I do will ever surpass what I did at 24. My name and face are for ever going to be someone else\u2019s intellectual property. My snot-flooded portrait was back. It\u2019s all anyone wanted to talk to me about. I bawled more. Refilled the bath. Stared at the wall.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/sep/12/blair-witch-review-horror-sequel\">Blair Witch review \u2013 found-footage sequel brings horror of deja-vu</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Then Lionsgate called. The company that originally bought The Blair Witch Project was purchased by Lionsgate and they\u2019re the ones behind this new sequel. They asked what they could do to show me how much they appreciated my work in the original. They made sure my last name wasn\u2019t used anywhere. In their press materials, their protagonist goes in search of his \u201csister\u201d but they don\u2019t use my name. For all the talk of Hollywood being populated with jerks and sharks, these guys were actually being considerate and were genuinely concerned that this would not be any more disruptive to my life than was inevitable.</p> <p>Sure, it helps them that I can say with total sincerity that I hope you\u2019ll go see this movie. It helps me too. It feels good to be proud of the work I did back then. It feels good to see it endure. It feels good to be acknowledged for my role in something that became such an indelible part of our culture. The Lionsgate folks made it seem so easy, because doing the right thing usually is. The wrong thing announces itself with an anxious clench. The right thing, the kind thing, has big soft life in it.</p> <p>I can\u2019t wait to watch those new Blair Witch kids die this weekend. I hope they\u2019re up for a lively ride.</p>",

The furrows in the dappled grey backgrounds, which have the ghostly patina of an etching, turn out to be the tracks of trucks and the grooves of dykes and berms, dug out to stop the desert sand from blowing into the salt pans.</p> <p>\u201cI like it when the viewer can\u2019t \u2018get it\u2019 instantly,\u201d says Burtynsky, poring over one of his two-metre wide prints to find a clue that proves we are looking at a river delta, not just an abstract swirl of reds and browns. Like spotting the striped red jersey in a <a href=\"http://www.whereswally.co.uk/\">Where\u2019s Wally illustration</a>, there is a satisfaction that comes from decoding the signs of life and industry in one of his sprawling scenes. \u201cYou should have to dig in with your eyes to work out what\u2019s going on.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7109d00f51565b244e9d916d4b4278b2ffcbf6f6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7109d00f51565b244e9d916d4b4278b2ffcbf6f6/0_0_1100_825/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Highland Valley #8 \u2026 an open pit copper mine in Canada\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Highland Valley #8 \u2026 an open pit copper mine in Canada</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Edward Burtynsky/Edward Burtynsky, Courtesy of Flowers Gallery, London / Metivier Gallery, Toronto</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>He\u2019d like you to dig in a little with your brain too, because these glossy visions are no mere enviro-porn. \u201cThere\u2019s definitely a \u2018holy shit!\u2019 aspect to the work,\u201d he says. \u201cWe\u2019re at a critical moment in history where we\u2019re starting to hit the thresholds of human expansion and the limits of what this planet can sustain.

His team scouts potential subjects from the comfort of Google Earth, then with GPS technology Burtynsky can fix a position in the air by latitude, longitude and altitude, and send a drone-mounted camera back again and again to the exact same spot until he\u2019s happy with the shot.<br></p> <p>He is currently engaged in a five-year project on the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/apr/01/generation-anthropocene-altered-planet-for-ever\">anthropocene</a>, the pending name for the present geological age in which humans have had a discernible impact on the environment, working in collaboration with scientists from the international <a href=\"http://quaternary.stratigraphy.org/workinggroups/anthropocene/\">Anthropocene Working Group</a>. \u201cWe\u2019ve had the five great extinctions,\u201d he says, referring to prehistoric devastations from the \u201cGreat Dying\u201d of the Permian eruptions, to the asteroid that wiped out the dinosaurs. \u201cNow humans are having the equivalent effect of that meteor impact.\u201d</p> <p>If his message is one of impending catastrophe \u2013 or indeed a catastrophe that\u2019s already happened \u2013 it is tempered by the fact that these manmade scars are incredibly seductive. Who could deny the alchemical allure of the <a href=\"http://www.flowersgallery.com/works/view/14915-phosphor-tailings-pond-2-polk-county-florida\">toxic phosphor tailings ponds</a> in Florida, or the beauty of the scrubby patchwork quilts left by mass deforestation? As Burtynsky admits, his images would be equally at home on a Greenpeace poster or the cover of an oil company\u2019s annual report. \u201cThe work asks more questions than it answers,\u201d he says. \u201cWhich is what artists are there to do.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"16afc5269bc641a002aa9052208375b46c9e9abf\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/16afc5269bc641a002aa9052208375b46c9e9abf/0_0_1100_824/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Salt pans in the Little Rann of Kutch, Gujarat, India.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"749\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018An archaic, almost primordial feeling\u2019 \u2026 salt pans in the Little Rann of Kutch, Gujarat, India.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Edward Burtynsky, Courtesy of Flowers Gallery, London / Metivier Gallery, Toronto</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Further questions are raised in a new book that accompanies the exhibition, <a href=\"http://www.thamesandhudsonusa.com/books/edward-burtynsky-essential-elements-hardcover\">Essential Elements</a>, which pairs his photographs, sometimes by tonal values or patterns, rhyming the forms of rice terraces with those of oil fields, but also by narratives that hint at a more critical agenda. On one spread, the mirror-glass skyline of Toronto, shot in the late afternoon sun, faces a gnarled hole in the ground in Australia, the sunset pinks and turquoises echoing the sandy soil and greenish lake at the bottom of the copper mine. \u201cWe build cities and leave holes in the ground where they came from,\u201d says Burtynsky. He refers to quarries as \u201cinverted skyscrapers\u201d.</p> <p>Flicking through the book is like touring the landscapes of late capitalism, tracing the supply chains of our consumer culture back to both ends \u2013 where the stuff came from and where it ends up. A field of shiny motorbikes is paired with a heap of tyres, an iron-ore mine with a ship-breaking yard. His post-production can be a little heavy-handed with the contrast and saturation levels, in the quest for pin-sharp clarity. But this is also part of his conscious aesthetic: images are pumped up until the entire picture plane is flattened into a surface seething with granular detail, or what he calls \u201cthe democratic distribution of light and space across the whole field,\u201d a neutrality that encourages the eye to wander.</p> <p>The flattening of these gaping scenes plunges the viewer headlong into the dams and reservoirs, aqueducts and deltas of this global survey. It brings a visceral sense of places that have been drained, drilled, excavated and extracted, terrains that have an archaic, almost primordial feeling. This is the fundamental matter from which human civilisation has been wrought, the landscapes that have been squeezed and scraped for their material worth, ravaged and disfigured on an epic scale, leaving beautiful residue in their wake.</p> <p>\u201cIn our ephemeral information age, people think we\u2019ve left behind the stone, bronze and iron ages,\u201d says Burtynsky. \u201cBut they\u2019re all still going on \u2013 we use tonnes of this stuff every day.

  "<p>High-profile BBC journalists and presenters such as Nick Robinson, Laura Kuenssberg and John Humphrys will have their pay made public as part of a plan imposed by the government while it renews the BBC\u2019s royal charter.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/may/12/director-general-fears-ministerial-influence-over-bbc-in-white-paper\">BBC chief voices fears over ministerial influence outlined in white paper</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The Department of Culture will announce on Thursday that it has told the BBC it must disclose the salaries of the 109 TV and radio presenters <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/aug/02/bbc-reveal-pay-stars-earning-more-prime-minister\">who earn more than \u00a3150,000 a year</a>, a figure far below that previously envisaged.</p> <p>David Cameron had told the BBC before last June\u2019s EU referendum that the pay disclosure should only apply to on-air talent earning more than \u00a3450,000 a year. But Theresa May, the prime minister, and Karen Bradley, the culture secretary, have chosen to reduce the amount, meaning that many of the corporation\u2019s best-known journalists will have their pay announced.</p> <p>It is expected that Kirsty Wark, Fiona Bruce and Jeremy Vine will be among those whose pay will have to be disclosed by the broadcaster. Others likely to be affected include Tess Daly and Claudia Winkleman, who present Strictly Come Dancing. Initially their pay will have to be disclosed in \u00a350,000 bands, though these will narrow.</p> <p>The BBC has been highly critical of plans to force it to disclose what presenters earn, describing them as a \u201cpoachers\u2019 charter\u201d because it would give rivals a clear idea of how to woo some of their best-known names at a time when competition in television is intensifying. <br></p> <p>Earlier this week, Channel 4 agreed to pay \u00a325m a year to snatch the Great British Bake Off from the BBC \u2013 and the two broadcasters are now in a tug of war over the programme\u2019s judges Paul Hollywood and Mary Berry.</p> <p>However, the government is determined to introduce greater transparency to publicly funded bodies. The draft charter is also likely to require that the BBC moves to smaller bands than \u00a350,000 \u201cin line with public sector best practice\u201d in the future.</p> <p>A government source said: \u201cLicence fee payers have a right to know where their money goes. By making the BBC more transparent, it will help deliver savings that then can be invested in even more great programmes.\u201d </p> <p>At present, the BBC discloses the amounts received by its most highly paid stars in wide income bands on an anonymous basis. The broadcaster\u2019s latest annual report revealed that the number of BBC stars earning from \u00a3500,000 to \u00a35m a year fell from nine to seven last year. These seven, likely to include Gary Lineker and Chris Evans as well as Graham Norton, shared \u00a36.6m in total, a decline of 25% compared with the total for all those earning more than \u00a3500,000 in 2014-15.</p> <p>The government\u2019s disclosure rules only apply to those paid by the licence fee, which is expected to catch most of the best-known news presenters. The pay of senior BBC executives is already disclosed, with government sources calling the historic secrecy around presenters\u2019 and actors\u2019 pay \u201can anomaly\u201d. </p> <p>Actors and on-air talent paid for by the BBC\u2019s commercial arm or under co-production deals could still avoid the disclosure rules in theory, as will all on-air talent working for the BBC\u2019s commercial rivals. Two of the main presenters of Great British Bake Off, Berry and Hollywood, for example, are not thought to be employed directly by the BBC but by Love Productions.</p> <p>The charter document will also finalise plans to reform the BBC\u2019s governance. On Tuesday, the BBC\u2019s chairman, Rona Fairhead, announced that she would not be staying on after Theresa May decided that an earlier agreement that she should remain in post until 2018 would not be honoured and there there would be an \u201copen and transparent process\u201d of recruitment which the DCMS said would start \u201cin the coming weeks\u201d.</p> <p>Ministers are expected to confirm they only intend to appoint up to five board members, including the chair and up to four members representing the nations and regions. A new, single BBC board, replacing the old two-tier BBC Trust and executive board, will include five other \u201cindependent\u201d board members and four other corporation executives \u2013 meaning that government appointees will be in a minority. </p> <p>That will be seen as a victory for the BBC, which had warned of the risks of creeping political control. But the defenestration of Fairhead has left bad feeling among some of the outgoing trustees, some of whom have told the Guardian of their \u201cabsolute outrage\u201d over her treatment.</p> <p>Although the decision by Cameron to allow Fairhead to extend her contract in May after a behind-the-scenes deal was widely criticised, reversing the decision a matter of months before the end of the existing trust has proved equally controversial.<br></p> <p>One trustee, who did not want to be named, said: \u201cThis is quite simply an affront to and massive erosion of the independence of the BBC. </p> <p>\u201cThis ground zero approach seems to be Theresa May\u2019s trademark \u2026 This is not just utterly brutal to [Fairhead], it\u2019s bad for the BBC. There is a vital distinction between a national and a state broadcaster and this regime has simply decided to appoint its own person to the job.\u201d</p> <p>Given the surprise over Fairhead\u2019s departure, which will only happen once the trust itself is wound up early next year, few names have emerged as favourites for the job. In the past, former ITV\u2019s chairman, Archie Norman, and Pearson\u2019s boss, Marjorie Scardino, have been mooted for the role.</p> <p>Other plans expected to be unveiled in the new charter include a clause to prevent the BBC striking financial settlements with the Treasury in secret, such as last year\u2019s arrangement, which saddled the BBC with the cost of free licence fees for the over-75s. Instead any new licence fee settlement is likely to be put before parliament for debate.</p>",

  "<p><strong>Q</strong> My partner and I own our home outright. We plan to buy a second property to rent out using \u00a360,000 in savings and a mortgage of \u00a3120,000 secured on our home rather than a buy-to-let mortgage. The second property is not for immediate profit but for the long term \u2013 our children will hopefully be able to raise cash from it to use as deposits in years to come.</p> <p>We aren\u2019t married yet, so to avoid the extra 3% stamp duty on second properties we are thinking that it be worth taking one of our names off the property we live in and buying the second property in the sole name of the other person. From what I have read, if you are not married you are considered as two parties. <br></p> <p>We are aware of the tax implications of letting property and the capital gains tax, but we do not intend to sell for many years.<br></p> <p>We are keen to see if we should do this as we will decide whether to buy now and marry later if it will save us the extra 3% stamp duty. <strong>KM</strong></p> <p><strong>A</strong> You are right in thinking that the two people in a married couple or civil partnership are treated as one for the purposes of working out whether the higher rates of stamp duty land tax on second properties are payable. So, for example, if a married couple own a home they live in and buy a second property \u2013 even if each property is in the name of just one spouse \u2013 the couple is treated as owning two properties and so they have to pay the higher rate of stamp duty on the second property.<br></p> <p>You are also right in thinking that, as an unmarried couple, if you each bought a property in your sole name and thus owned only one property each, the higher rates of stamp duty would not come into play. However, the higher rates would apply if you went ahead with a joint purchase of a second property.<br></p> <p>Putting your home into your partner\u2019s sole name and buying the property that you plan to rent out in your sole name before you marry is feasible, but I\u2019m not convinced it is a wise move. It is true that, assuming a purchase price of \u00a3180,000 for the second property, it would mean a stamp duty bill of \u00a31,100 rather than \u00a36,500 \u2013 a saving of \u00a35,400. However, you need to ask yourself if you would feel comfortable giving away \u2013 and so losing control over \u2013 your share of the family home. Even if you did, you would have to go to the expense of getting new wills drawn up so that you would inherit the property if your partner died.<br></p> <p>There are other drawbacks in doing what you propose. If your home is in your partner\u2019s sole name, you won\u2019t be able to raise cash from it by remortgaging, so you would need a buy-to-let mortgage for the second property, which is likely to cost more than remortgaging your current home. <br></p> <p>If you buy the second property on your own, all the rental income will be taxed as yours, which could push you into the higher-rate tax bracket. And assuming that the capital gains tax (CGT) rules don\u2019t change in the meantime, when you come to sell the property you will be responsible for paying the tax on the whole of the taxable gain. If the property were owned jointly, the gain would be split between the two of you and each of you would be able to take advantage of the CGT annual exempt amount of \u00a311,100 (in the 2016-17 tax year). </p>",

  "<p>At a digital innovation consultancy in central Helsinki, the men\u2019s toilets were causing something of an inconvenience. The Finnish company, Futurice, employs many male employees and the bathrooms were often occupied.</p> <p>However, now they can find out if one is free without leaving their desk. An app with a live map of the office tells them. \u201cThe bathrooms on the map turn red when they\u2019re occupied and green when they\u2019re unoccupied. Then you know where to go,\u201d says Paul Houghton, who has the grand title of director of wizardry and development at Futurice.<br></p> <p>The live map was created by Houghton and his colleagues to explore whether internet of things (IoT) technologies, where objects communicate with each other over the internet, could improve working life for staff and also save them time. <br></p> <p>It displays real-time information about what\u2019s happening in the office, for example quiet places to work. Using Wi-Fi beacon triangulation, it shows where someone is in the building at a particular moment (their marker moves when they move) and is designed to encourage ad hoc social interactions and make it easy to find people. Soon it will have a heat map showing areas that are particularly warm or cool.<br></p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>In a poll, 58%\u200b said IoT increased collaboration while 54% believed it raised productivity</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Houghton, who is the mastermind behind project V\u00f6r, says: \u201cWe built the whole service around the idea of indoor location. It\u2019s an experiment in creating the office of the future. But it\u2019s also because we moved office from one part of Helsinki to the centre where we have a new open [plan] office type of environment and there were some problems with this new space that we felt we could address with technology.\u201d<br></p> <p>A designer was brought in and staff were interviewed about what they wanted. Besides the bathroom issue, another common irritation was around hot-desking. \u201cBecause we\u2019re right in the centre of town we have less space and because we\u2019re a consultancy our people are away on customer site. So when you come in you don\u2019t have a permanent place to work. The first thing you think when you walk in is: where am I going to sit today? Where are my friends or teammates?\u201d<br></p> <p>The team began experimenting. Beacons, (Futurice uses small wireless sensors that can attach to a location or object, they broadcast tiny radio signals which a smartphone can receive and interpret), switches, cameras and air quality sensors were placed around the office, and these communicate with employees\u2019 phones over the office network via the Android app. Motion sensors send information to the map about which desks are free.<br></p> <p>However, the experiment has discovered that, in certain areas of office life, the technology wasn\u2019t welcome. \u201cWe put motion sensors in the [men\u2019s] bathrooms, and I thought it would be interesting to also put in an air-quality sensor in the bathroom, so it would sense methane in this case,\u201d says Houghton. \u201cBut I was kicked out of the ladies\u2019 room with my tail between my legs because they told me, in no uncertain terms, that this is their private space and they didn\u2019t want any spaceship-looking sensors.\u201d<br></p> <p>It\u2019s a light-hearted point but highlights serious concerns around the internet of things and privacy. While knowing where your colleagues are in real time might be useful, isn\u2019t there something sinister about being able to watch a colleague\u2019s every move? Offices can breed resentments and personality clashes, so how can they ensure this won\u2019t be used against people?<br></p> <p>Houghton points out the project has been created by staff, not the company, and they have endeavoured to put the user in control of their own information. \u201cIt\u2019s an entirely opt-in system. It\u2019s been created by a few of us employees playing around. You can turn it off \u2026 or you can just not install it on your phone. Not everyone uses it, for sure.\u201d </p> <p>Then there\u2019s the question of the data generated and what happens to it. Houghton says none of the information leaves the office. \u201cIt\u2019s not in the cloud. It\u2019s not written down anywhere. There\u2019s no record, it\u2019s just what\u2019s happening near me right now.\u201d They have no plans to sell the software, says Houghton, it\u2019s just for internal use.<br></p> <p>It\u2019s unsurprising that businesses are experimenting with the internet of things. Those that use these technologies experience clear benefits, according to a <a href=\"https://hbr.org/resources/pdfs/comm/verizon/18980_HBR_Verizon_IoT_Nov_14.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">survey </a>in 2014 by the Harvard Business Review. Of those polled, 58% said it increased collaboration within the business while 54% believed it increased employee productivity.<br></p> <p>Mike Gotta, research vice president at IT research and advisory company Gartner, says the idea of \u201cindoor mapping\u201d, or a \u201cGoogle maps for the building\u201d could become a handy tool for office staff. \u201cImagine you\u2019re a new hire at a big company, you\u2019re going to meet someone but you don\u2019t know where they sit. All you see is a sea of cubicles.\u201d As the new recruit walks through the office, information could be sent to their phone telling them about the department they\u2019re walking through, says Gotta.<br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/careers/2015/oct/12/five-simple-ideas-that-will-change-the-way-you-work\">Five simple ideas that will change the way you work</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The technology could also be used to promote wellbeing, says Gotta. The health conscious could be given the longest route to get from A to B. \u201cIf you\u2019re 15 minutes early for a meeting you could walk the long way.\u201d It\u2019s not a big leap from apps that are already out there. \u201cThere are some consumer apps \u2013 you need to apply that concept to the workplace,\u201d he says.<br></p> <p>Gerard Grech, chief executive of Tech City UK, says: \u201cWe\u2019ve seen great examples of IoT being adopted within offices to boost productivity, keep staff happy, improve the work environment and save energy \u2013 but these are just a few areas where IoT is being applied.\u201d<br></p> <p>He gives the example of marketing agency Partners Andrew Aldridge, which has created a detector that automatically triggers purifiers if air quality in the office is poor.<br></p> <p>Many larger tech companies around the world are using IoT to drive business performance and morale within the team, says Grech. E-commerce company Klarna, based in the UK and Sweden, and US-based Twilio have connected live data and messages to screens throughout the office to keep staff updated in real time or to say thank you to someone who helped out a fellow employee.<br></p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re merely scraping the surface of what could be achieved if more offices look at how they can adopt the internet of things and data to improve everything from operations to sales, and happiness to product development,\u201d says Grech.<br></p> <p>Many people will feel uncomfortable with the idea of technology being deployed to promote their happiness at work. However Futurice\u2019s Houghton doesn\u2019t see it that way. They haven\u2019t measured whether staff productivity has increased. However he says: \u201cThese little conveniences add up and they save a little bit of time.

The organisation emerged four years ago at a time of mounting climatic stress in Santiago.</p> <p>A recent protest saw at least 2,000 people take to the capital\u2019s streets to demand the repeal of laws that privatised Chile\u2019s water supply. At the heart of the protest and others like it in recent years lies frustration that the privatisation of water has kept prices unnecessarily high, delivered poor service and done little to address concerns over insufficient supply in the future.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"9011aa417b8915449265e533644a33987c3ecddf\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9011aa417b8915449265e533644a33987c3ecddf/723_283_3528_2117/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A street flooded from the overflowing of the Mapocho river during heavy rains in Santiago on April\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A flooded Santiago street during April\u2019s heavy rains, when 4 million people were left without tap water.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Pascal Diaz/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>With water availability to Santiago <a href=\"http://sdcenter.org/santiago-climate-risk-and-response/\" rel=\"nofollow\">predicted</a> to fall 40% by 2070, residents are right to be concerned about the future of their water. For Fern\u00e1ndez, while climate change poses a serious threat to the city\u2019s water supplies, she believes the issue is principally political: \u201cThe root of the problem lies in the commodification of the nation\u2019s water under [Pinochet\u2019s] dictatorship,\u201d she said.</p> <p>The process of water privatisation in Chile which began in 1981 under General Pinochet established a model for water management that strengthened private water rights, adopted a market-based allocation system and reduced state oversight. That model became emblematic of neoliberal reforms heavily promoted by the World Bank and International Monetary Fund.</p> <p>These reforms fundamentally changed the way water is valued and managed globally. No longer a mere necessity for human survival, water has become an object of international financial speculation and experts <a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/willem-buiter-water-2011-7\" rel=\"nofollow\">predict</a> that \u201cblue gold\u201d will soon become the most important physical commodity worldwide, dwarfing oil and precious metals.</p> <p>Pinochet\u2019s political demise in 1990 was not the end of Chile\u2019s faith in a privatised water supply.

The Chilean government\u2019s special <a href=\"https://www.camara.cl/trabajamos/comision_portada.aspx?prmID=720\" rel=\"nofollow\">committee on water resources</a> recently proposed reforms to national water laws. Those proposals, now under discussion in congress, would prioritise human consumption over commercial use and grant the Water Directorate new oversight powers.</p> <p>The private sector is resisting reform, however. The Confederation of Production and Commerce, representing the Chilean private sector, made its opposition clear in a <a href=\"http://www.cpc.cl/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Declaracion-publica-CPC-sobre-regimen-juridico-de-propiedad-de-derechos-de-aguas.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">statement</a> (pdf) last month.

  "<p>When New Zealander Kate Jones* realised the fairy tale of marriage and kids was taking its sweet time she took out an insurance policy and applied for donated sperm.</p> <p>\u201cSince I was 10 years old, I just expected to have a baby when I grew up,\u201d she says. </p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve always wanted to be a mother, but the idea of going to a clinic for that never featured.\u201d</p> <p>With the encouragement of her family and friends, Jones registered with a clinic. What she didn\u2019t realise was that the current waiting list was up to two years.</p> <p>\u201cI had no idea there was a shortage, that came as a real surprise. But it\u2019s something out of my control, so I just tried to get on with life while I waited. I kept dating, still hoping to have a baby the traditional way.\u201d</p> <p>New Zealand is in the grip of a sperm drought, with fertility counsellors saying long waiting times are putting significant strain on already stressed prospective mothers.</p> <p>\u201cIncreasingly we are hearing of New Zealand women travelling overseas for reproductive tourism,\u201d said Dr Mary Birdsall, a fertility specialist with Fertility Associates.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a very challenging situation. It\u2019s challenging to recruit donors, and it is tough on the women who are psychologically and biologically ready to start a family, but can\u2019t.\u201d</p> <p>In 2004 the New Zealand government introduced legislation banning anonymous sperm donations and preventing donors from receiving any payment for their services.</p> <p>Donors in New Zealand have minimal costs covered (such as travel to the clinic) but are not compensated for their time, which after rigorous medical testing and counselling, can be significant.</p> <p>Under the new law, the sperm donor must also agree to being identified to any offspring when the child turns 18.</p> <p>A decline in sperm donations following the introduction of the legislation coincided with a sharp rise in same-sex and single women applying for donated sperm.</p> <p>Dr John Peek, general manager of Fertility Associates, New Zealand\u2019s largest fertility clinic, said there is usually enough sperm in the country to treat about 80 families, but the number of people applying for the sperm is around four times that.</p> <p>\u201cNew Zealand has had a shortage of sperm donors for a long time,\u201d said Peek.</p> <p>\u201cI think rather than peaking it has become a continuous drought.

Even six months could make the difference between having a child or not.\u201d</p> <p>In 2015 Fertility Associates treated 300 women with donated sperm. Of those 35% were heterosexual couples with male infertility issues, 25% were lesbian couples and 40% were single women.</p> <p>McDonald said single women now make up the largest group seeking donated sperm at Repromed - and the first process in their journey is often grief counselling. </p> <p>\u201cSome women feel a sense of shame at having to take this route to becoming a mother,\u201d said McDonald.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6a3bc87f892ee01a926e3bb8fe6281aa5438a41c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6a3bc87f892ee01a926e3bb8fe6281aa5438a41c/0_1485_3506_2104/1000.jpg\" alt=\"In 2004 the New Zealand government introduced legislation banning anonymous sperm donations.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">In 2004 the New Zealand government introduced legislation banning anonymous sperm donations.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sarah Jones (debut Art)/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cOne of the first steps is grieving, that life has not turned out how you hoped.

She also investigated New Zealand websites set up to acquire sperm, but found them \u201ca bit dodgy\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThey\u2019re not very professional. They can be a bit creepy even.

That\u2019s not sperm donation, that\u2019s sex.\u201d</p> <p> In 2015 the Advisory Committee on Assisted Reproductive Technology (ACART) advised the New Zealand government that foreign sperm and eggs should be allowed into New Zealand and subject to the same rules that apply to local donors.</p> <p>Comparable countries like Australia and England allow the importation of foreign sperm, and demand is growing from Kiwi women that New Zealand should follow suit.</p> <p>The ACART report found many New Zealand women were already travelling overseas to procure sperm, but time, cost and murky trans-border legislation meant it was not a viable option for most.</p> <p>The report was delivered to the health minister at the beginning of 2015. A spokesperson from the ministry said it expected the minister to assess the report by the end of 2016.</p> <p>Peek said his clinic could not explore overseas options until the minister ruled on import and export legislation, but it was \u201cdifficult not to say yes\u201d to women who were increasingly desperate.</p> <p> Jones is supportive of New Zealand allowing the importation of foreign sperm, but says New Zealand men should be better educated about donation first \u2013 and better compensated for their time if they do donate.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/22/what-is-it-really-like-to-live-in-new-zealand\">What is it really like to live in New Zealand?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>After a year\u2019s wait, Jones was given the choice between two sperm donors.

The Russians have basically hacked into both parties at the national level and that gives us all concern about what their motivations are.</p> <p>\u201cThe FBI director would tell you they\u2019re just trying to undermine the integrity of the process,\u201d McCaul continued, after Blitzer noted that if Russia had hacked the RNC, it was news to him. \u201cThey are not discriminating one party against the other.</p> <p>\u201cThey have hacked into the RNC, so this is, again, they\u2019re not picking sides here, I don\u2019t think,\u201d McCaul said. \u201cThey\u2019re hacking into both political parties.

Clinton placed half of Trump supporters in a \u201cbasket of deplorables\u201d on 9 September and stumbled upon leaving the World Trade Center on 11 September. Trump led Clinton 44-39 in a four-way race in the poll, with Libertarian candidate Gary Johnson scoring an impressive 10 points.</p> <p>No Republican has ever won the presidency without winning Ohio, which has picked the winner in every presidential election since 1964.

  "<p>Parklets are popping up everywhere. Cities around the world \u2013 and increasingly across Australia, from <a href=\"http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-09-18/pop-up-parks-catch-on-in-perth/6788094\">Fremantle</a> to the <a href=\"http://www.qt.com.au/news/council-approves-parklet-trial-effort-improve-busi/1799512/\">Fraser coast</a> \u2013 are introducing programs to convert roadside parking spots into more green and sociable spaces.</p> <p>In Sydney, Waverley council\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.waverley.nsw.gov.au/building/current_projects/bondi_junction_projects/great_places/urban_interventions\">Urban Interventions</a> program received an award for \u201cbest planning idea\u201d from the Planning Institute of Australia (New South Wales) in 2014. The Glebe Chamber of Commerce is running a <a href=\"mailto:https://pozible.com/project/glebe-parklet-share-your-city\">crowdfunding campaign</a> to turn its pilot parklet into a more lasting installation.</p> <p>Before parklets there was <a href=\"http://rebargroup.org/parking/\">PARK(ing)</a>. In 2005, members of the San Francisco design collective Rebar paid an on-street parking meter for two hours. Rebar used the space to create a \u201cpark\u201d with turf, a tree, a bench and signs inviting passersby to sit and relax. It then packed up and returned the space to its former condition.</p> <p>While the event was not intended to continue beyond the initial two hours, photos and video were rapidly shared online. The images proved inspirational: requests quickly came from people asking how to create their own \u201cparks\u201d. Rebar responded by producing a how-to guide and launched an event that would make a much bigger statement about the use of public space.</p> <h2>Going global</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"86e96487294e3f17e23a6dcf68c447b5893cd795\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/86e96487294e3f17e23a6dcf68c447b5893cd795/0_25_754_452/500.jpg\" alt=\"Rebar\u2019s original pop-up park in San Francisco in 2005\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">From little things: Rebar\u2019s original pop-up park in San Francisco in 2005.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: my.parkingday.org</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In 2006 the first <a href=\"http://parkingday.org/archive/\">PARK(ing) Day</a> was celebrated with 47 \u201cparks\u201d in 13 cities across three countries. The event grew rapidly, expanding to more than 200 parks in 2007 and featuring in the Venice Architecture Biennale in 2008. By 2011 PARK(ing) Day included almost 1,000 parks in 35 countries.</p> <p>PARK(ing) Day has spread beyond the event itself. As well as parklet programs, the first of which was introduced in <a href=\"http://pavementtoparks.org/parklets/\">San Francisco</a> in 2010, participants have gone on to develop a range of related events \u2013 from the <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3069577/Skipsters-Charity-Melbourne-creates-mobile-park-street-using-SKIP-look-trendy-alternative-place-hang-out.html\">skipsters</a> of Melbourne to the <a href=\"http://www.mtlblog.com/2015/05/montreals-free-summer-boardwalk-village-is-back-this-june/\">temporary villages</a> of Montreal to the worldwide <a href=\"http://betterblock.org/\">Better Block</a> movement.</p> <p>At the core of PARK(ing) Day is an idea about law. Paying the parking meter was seen as a way to access ownership, albeit temporarily, in a city where the means to acquire legal title were beyond the reach of many residents.<br></p> <p>Its instigators described this act as creating a \u201clease\u201d, a property right that brought with it a right to engage in planning, by participating in the development of a vision of what could be and, significantly, in the (fleeting) material creation of that vision.</p> <p>At first, the vision was for more parks in an area that \u2013 according to the city\u2019s own maps \u2013 had little green space. In subsequent iterations in cities around the world, PARK(ing) Day participants have claimed and reclaimed the street in diverse and dynamic ways: from croquet greens to community health clinics, libraries to lemonade stands, bike workshops to weddings.</p> <p>Turning a parking space into a park is a quirky idea but even in 2005 it was not entirely new. Precedents can be found in many cities over many years: from the installations on California roads by Bonnie Ora Sherk in the 1970s, to the <a href=\"http://tlchamilton.blogspot.com/2001/07/parking-meter-party.html\">Parking Meter Parties</a> held in Hamilton, Ontario, from 2001, to Ted Dewan\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.wormworks.com/roadwitch/pages/livingroom.htm\">road witching</a> in Oxford, the UK, from 2003, to Michael Rakowitz\u2019s 2004 <a href=\"http://www.michaelrakowitz.com/plot-proposition-i/\">(P)LOT</a> projects in Vienna, Austria, and Trento, Italy.</p> <p>Yet none of these precursors succeeded in engaging or inspiring people on such a grand scale.</p> <h2>The power of a \u2018sticky\u2019 idea</h2> <p>Rebar describes PARK(ing) Day as a \u201csticky\u201d idea. With very little organisation \u2013 almost none in recent years, since Rebar no longer exists \u2013 the event has proved extremely durable.</p> <p>While some participants engage consistently over many years (the Sydney office of <a href=\"http://fieldsofactivity.com/parking-day/\">Arup has built \u201cparks\u201d</a> seven times since 2008), most take part just a few times. Yet PARK(ing) Day continues to attract new participants: North Sydney girls high school and locals around Australia Street, Newtown, are some of the newest.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjMLGCingNo\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ZjMLGCingNo?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>The reach of PARK(ing) may be traced to the power of the initial image, or to the success (or luck) of Rebar in connecting with particularly influential people.</p> <p>But a key part of the event\u2019s success is its connection to law. PARK(ing) Day was not presented as a protest, a plea for change, or a proposal for reform. On the contrary, PARK(ing) Day was expressly presented as something already legal. PARK(ing) Day provides a powerful invitation to citizens around the world to rethink the city and their place in it.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"counter\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;The\u00a0Conversation&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;https://counter.theconversation.edu.au/content/64359/count.gif&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <p><em>\u2022 Friday, 16 September, is the 11th PARK(ing) Day.

  "<p>From giving women the vote to repealing the White Australia Policy, the Australian parliament has an amazing history of taking the transformative decisions that make this country so great today. </p> <p>On issues like economic reform and gun control, Australia was well ahead of its time and we\u2019re still seen as a global leader. </p> <p>That great history makes it all the more bizarre that we\u2019re on the brink of handballing the next big social change \u2013 marriage equality \u2013 to an expensive and unnecessary plebiscite, rather than dealing with it in parliament like every other decision that doesn\u2019t need a change to the constitution. </p> <p>When we elect our MPs, we trust and expect them to make those calls.

Given that the rate of depression for gay Australians is much higher than the national average, that\u2019s a serious concern.</p> <p>This isn\u2019t about giving people time and space for a national debate. Australians have been talking about marriage equality seriously since the early 2000s and we already have the forums for people to express their views on both sides, including the media and the parliament itself. The issue is with using taxpayer funds in a way that could give a platform to the worst kind of homophobic rhetoric \u2013 without even binding parliament to the result. </p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/video/2016/sep/13/children-from-rainbow-families-discuss-marriage-equality-plebiscite-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/52z2h\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2714138\"            data-video-name=\"Children from Rainbow Families discuss marriage equality plebiscite \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"guardian.co.uk\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-57d7a185e4b08465d4500198\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/09/13/160913gaymarriage_h264_publish.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=11572802&amp;format=video/m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=11572802&amp;format=video/webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/video/2016/sep/13/children-from-rainbow-families-discuss-marriage-equality-plebiscite-video\">Children from Rainbow Families discuss marriage equality plebiscite</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>There have only been three plebiscites in Australian history and the last one was the vote on whether to change a national anthem \u201cAdvance Australia Fair\u201d.

Hoth Mai served as the chief of staff and deputy chief of logistics of the Sudan People\u2019s Liberation Army before being dismissed in 2014.</p> <p>\u201cThe residence is situated on a one-acre lot backing up to a forested area bordering nearby Lysterfield Lake, a popular destination for sailing, canoeing and mountain biking,\u201d the Sentry report says. </p> <p>\u201cThe home boasts four bedrooms, a top-of-the-line kitchen, a two-tiered home theatre, a sauna and an infinity pool. When the Sentry visited the home in August 2016, a BMW 316 used by one of Hoth Mai\u2019s daughters was parked in front of the house. </p> <p>\u201cThe home was described by the real estate agency that sold it as \u2018perfecting the balance between serenity and glamour\u2019. </p> <p>The agent who sold Hoth Mai the home, and who did not want to be named, told Guardian Australia that he thought the family \u201cwere lovely and very well-mannered and well-educated\u201d.</p> <p>Contrary to the Sentry report\u2019s claims, he said the property was originally bought in Hoth Mai\u2019s wife\u2019s name, not his son\u2019s. The name was transferred to his son at settlement. The agent said he did show Hoth Mai through the home once and that the property had been paid for using money transferred from overseas bank accounts, including from Dubai. </p> <p>According to <a href=\"http://www.theaustralian.com.au/national-affairs/foreign-affairs/south-sudan-general-on-60k-paid-15m-cash-for-melbourne-mansion/news-story/0989507a63845168e03df6fdf8d577c2\">a report in the Australian</a>, the former owner of the home grew suspicious of the Hoth Mai family owing to difficulties with the settlement, including the family experiencing trouble getting money out of Dubai. He reported his concerns to the Foreign Investment Review Board but told the Australian the board \u201cdidn\u2019t want a bar of it\u201d.</p> <p>The Guardian has sought comment from Hoth Mai.</p> <p>In July Australia\u2019s foreign affairs minister, Julie Bishop, announced $8m in funding for the South Sudan humanitarian fund and the UN high commissioner for refugees to deliver deliver food, shelter, security and other assistance to South Sudanese who had fled the conflict to neighbouring countries. It brought Australia\u2019s total contribution to South Sudan to more than $50m since December 2013.</p> <p> The Sentry report also states that the president, Salva Kiir, and the opposition leader, Riek Machar, had both amassed wealth from the conflict, which they had shared with their family through luxury trips, cars and homes.<br></p> <p>\u201cSeveral of President Kiir\u2019s other children have attended high school and college in Australia, Malaysia and Uganda,\u201d the report said. </p> <p>\u201cAnd President Kiir\u2019s children appear to travel internationally for more than just their education.

While fiction might be the catalyst for this discussion, in the eyes of Abdel-Magied and others the issues are deeply rooted in real-world politics and a long history.</p> <p>The image of the blackface minstrel artist of 1830s America \u2013 the white performer painted up to look like a caricature of an African-American person and performing comic skits \u2013 is perhaps the most oft-invoked example of cultural appropriation from history. <a href=\"http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/foster/sfeature/sf_minstrelsy.html#\">The racial dynamic of minstrelsy was complex</a> \u2013 it was performed by African-American and Anglo actors alike \u2013 but while African-American performers often sought to gain financial security from the practice and in some cases use their platform to <a href=\"http://exhibits.lib.usf.edu/exhibits/show/minstrelsy/jimcrow-to-jolson/african-american-performers\">counter negative public stereotypes of themselves</a>, white performers reinforced those stereotypes. This occurred within a society which still had not abolished slavery, and in which the political power dynamic was very much racialized. As the civil rights movement grew, so did criticism of white people attempting to exploit the images and experiences of people of colour for social and financial gain. </p> <p>This pattern is repeated around the world, particularly in places that experienced colonisation and slavery, such as India, Australia and South Africa. As scholars, artists, activists and writers of colour fought to gain access to predominantly white institutions and public spaces, and gained visibility in the cultural sphere, they began to criticise the inaccurate representations of themselves they saw created by and for the profit of others.</p> <p>The issue has been heavily explored within the academies but has gathered momentum in popular culture over the past decade. It underpins criticism of, among other things, Iggy Azalea\u2019s \u201c<a href=\"http://www.salon.com/2014/07/15/iggy_azaleas_post_racial_mess_americas_oldest_race_tale_remixed/\">sonic blackness</a>\u201d, Coldplay\u2019s \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/feb/01/coldplay-beyonce-hymn-for-the-weekend-cultural-appropriation-india\">myopic construction of India</a>\u201d in their music videos, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/aug/27/miley-cyrus-twerking-cultural-appropriation\">Miley Cyrus\u2019s dance moves</a>.

The argument has been assisted particularly by the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/dec/23/in-defence-of-intersectionality\">feminist community\u2019s focus on \u201cintersectionality\u201d</a> \u2013 crudely the idea that discrimination takes on different forms depending on the race, class and/or gender of the person discriminated against. </p> <p>The charge of \u201ccultural appropriation\u201d is not confined to fiction, but at the moment that\u2019s perhaps the most hotly contested terrain<strong>.</strong> In March, Harry Potter author JK Rowling was accused of appropriating the \u201cliving tradition of a marginalised people\u201d after a story published to her <a href=\"https://www.pottermore.com/\">Pottermore</a> website <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/mar/09/jk-rowling-under-fire-for-appropriating-navajo-tradition-history-of-magic-in-north-america-pottermore\">drew upon Navajo narratives about skinwalkers</a>. Shriver herself mentioned the case of white British author Chris Cleave, whose novel The Other Hand is partly narrated by the character of a teenage Nigerian girl. \u201cIn principle, I admire his courage,\u201d Shriver said. She then went on to detail <a href=\"http://www.sfgate.com/books/article/Little-Bee-by-Chris-Cleave-3168139.php\">reviewer Margot Kaminski\u2019s concerns</a> that Cleave was \u201cexploiting\u201d the character, that he ought to be \u201ctaking special care\u201d with representing an experience that was not his own.</p> <p>Shriver took aim at the suggestion that an author should not \u201cuse\u201d a character they created for the service of a plot they imagined. \u201cOf course he\u2019s using them for his plot!\u201d she said. \u201cHow could he not?

The difference between cultural representation and cultural appropriation, by this logic, lies in the white writer telling stories (and therefore taking publishing opportunities) that would be better suited to a writer of colour.</p> <p>Some writers argue that it works in reverse, too. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/nov/30/marlon-james-writers-of-colour-pander-white-woman-man-booker-event-brief-history-seven-killings\">In an event for the Guardian in November last year</a>, Booker Prize-winning author Marlon James said publishers too often \u201cpander to the white woman\u201d (the majority of the book-buying public), causing writers of colour to do the same.
