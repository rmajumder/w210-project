  "<p>A best man who swindled a groom and his friends out of almost \u00a38,000, failed to book flights for a stag do and lied about having terminal cancer has been jailed for 20 months.</p> <p>Martyn Galvin, 30, was sentenced on Thursday at Teesside crown court and ordered to repay the stolen funds.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/jun/24/stag-hen-dos-york-anti-social-behaviour\">Nobody actually enjoys stag and hen dos. Especially not the city of York | Joel Golby</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The stag party \u2013 the groom and 16 of his friends \u2013 only realised the deception when they got to Newcastle airport in August last year to find there were no flights or accommodation reserved in Prague. Galvin tried to blame the travel agent for getting the dates wrong.</p> <p>The groom had asked Galvin \u2013 his closest friend \u2013 to be best man at his wedding before he had even proposed to his partner, prosecutor Jenny Haigh told the court.</p> <p>He said Galvin, from Yarm in North Yorkshire, constantly distracted him from wedding plans with problems about payments for the stag dos in the Czech capital and a day at York races.</p> <p>In a statement read out in court, the groom said: \u201cWhen Martyn told me he had suspected cancer I was absolutely devastated for him and his family. I offered to take over the organising but he insisted, stating a groom should never have to organise his own stag do. How could I not feel guilty? I felt I had put too much on him.\u201d</p> <p>Galvin\u2019s claim to have terminal bowel cancer was exposed as a lie. </p> <p>\u201cI was told by his mum that he did not have any sort of cancer and he had not left the house all week. I was beyond devastated,\u201d the groom said. \u201cI could not believe that Martyn had done this to me.\u201d</p> <p>The victim said he now felt like he was known as \u201cthe groom whose best man screwed his friends and family over money, and I\u2019m ashamed\u201d.<br></p> <p>He added: \u201cFor months he conned me and a lot of our friends into thinking he was seriously ill for the plain reason of money. At no point did he hesitate in his scheme. He had six months to organise a stag do but he didn\u2019t. He just took the money he was asking people for.\u201d</p> <p>Despite the emotional turmoil that Galvin inflicted, the groom said he did not let the scam spoil his wedding. </p> <p>\u201cI picked a new best man and the wedding day was the proudest, happiest day of my life with no mention of the existence of Martyn or the stag do,\u201d he said. </p> <p>\u201cSince he confessed what he had done, I\u2019ve not seen Martyn and I never want to see him again.\u201d</p> <p>Judge Simon Bourne-Arton QC, the recorder of Middlesbrough, told Galvin that his scam was \u201cperhaps one of the nastiest and meanest I\u2019ve encountered in my time involved in criminal law\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThe fraud involved a string of quite dreadful lies, lies to your best friend, a man who entrusted in you the task and the honour of being his best man,\u201d he added.</p> <p>Duncan McReddie, defending, said Galvin had a long-running gambling addiction. His client was truly remorseful and he and his family would compensate all the victims in full.<br></p>",

  "<p>Cleaners who scrub toilets and change sheets for the world\u2019s elite sportsmen and women at the athletes\u2019 village in Rio earn less than \u00a310 a day, the Guardian has learned, even though many leave home at 4am and return from their Olympic workplace after 9pm.</p> <p>Their wages, indirectly paid by the UK service company Clean Event, are less than half what a housekeeper in Rio can expect and sit uneasily with the first-world service demanded by the International Olympic Committee.</p> <p>The figure also contrasts sharply with the \u00a3700 daily stipend paid to IOC executive members, who also get free hotel accommodation and flights.</p> <p>The cleaners are easy to spot at the workers\u2019 entrance of the village. Almost all are black women in blue uniforms printed with \u201chousekeeper\u201d. Around their necks are entry passes issued by Clean Event, though they work directly for a Swiss human resources subcontractor, Adecco.</p> <p>In a grim labour market, with unemployment at a record 11.3%, many are grateful for any job. But few laud the pay and conditions. One young woman, who requested anonymity, said cleaners were sometimes asked to do tasks outside their job description \u2013 such as clearing construction site debris. They were also banished from the grassy plaza provided for athletes and so had to rest in smoking areas, and often missed lunch because of long canteen queues.</p> <p>When cleaners fell sick or had an accident, she said, they were initially prohibited from using the main medical centre in the athletes\u2019 village, which was reserved for Olympic competitors. Instead they had to go to public hospitals farther away. This policy had subsequently been changed, she said, after the workers complained they were being treated like animals.</p> <p>But there are still problems. A second cleaner said an elderly worker fainted with a suspected heart attack. Police, rather than medical staff, removed her from the village. \u201cNo ambulances arrived because the preference is for the athletes. It\u2019s humiliation at every turn,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Cleaners are paid 5.91 reals (\u00a31.40) an hour. But deductions for food, transport and insurance left some earning little more than \u00a31 an hour for their eight-hour shift. The return on their time invested was even worse when commuting times were included. Rio\u2019s sprawl and poor public transport networks mean some have to travel more than two hours each way. The pay \u2013 just above the minimum wage \u2013 is legal but at odds with the global standards expected inside the Olympic bubble.</p> <p>\u201cThe athletes must be aware of our working conditions because they can see the poor quality of the work we do. There are too many buildings, not enough staff and no real incentive to do a good job,\u201d said a third cleaner.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/apr/07/rio-olympic-park-contruction-workers-clash-security-guards\">Rio Olympic Park construction workers clash with security guards</a> </p> </aside>  <p>All six cleaners interviewed by the Guardian complained of long lines for the canteen, which offered food that was described as \u201chorrible\u201d or \u201cdisgusting\u201d even though the cost was subtracted from their pay.</p> <p>Most said they accepted the conditions and were glad of the chance to earn money and see Olympic athletes. Their proximity \u2013 and lack of adequate training and supervision \u2013 has contributed to <a href=\"http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-08-06/rio-2016-moroccan-boxer-arrested-for-alleged-sexual-assault/7696532\">cases of sexual harassment against athletes</a>, as well as accusations of theft and prostitution by cleaners. A few crimes have been proven but the innocent majority are also suffering from guilt by association.</p> <p>\u201cWe are being treated like dogs, like thieves,\u201d said the second cleaner. \u201cWe often receive gifts from the athletes. They sign authorisations and we take pictures with them to prove that they gave the present to us. We also get signatures from our supervisors. But the security guards forbid us from leaving with the gifts, because they think we stole them. We can\u2019t wear brand-name tennis shoes because we\u2019ll be accused of theft.\u201d</p> <p>Observers at the village said the situation was humiliating and unjust.</p> <p>\u201cIt is a mess. The companies that are involved are closing their eyes,\u201d said a Brazilian volunteer inside the athletes\u2019 village, who said all of the cleaners were Afro-Brazilians from poor backgrounds. \u201cThe foreign service companies get a big contract and then pay this shameful amount of money because they choose the poorest workers. They couldn\u2019t do that in Sydney and London but they do that in Brazil. I feel bad about that.\u201d</p> <p>However, Manuel Thedim, director of the Institute of Work and Society, said broader problems were to blame for the discrepancies in conditions in London and Rio.</p> <p>\u201cThe world isn\u2019t a pretty place. If the productivity is less in Brazil, you pay less.\u201d He said the salary was not absurdly low: although house cleaners in middle class families could earn 60% more, he said, they tended to have higher social capital and better contacts.</p> <p>Brazil\u2019s labour ministry said it had notified Adecco about irregularities in the village, including food and equipment lapses that put workers at risk.</p> <p>Clean Event offices in Rio and London did not respond to requests for comment.</p> <p>In a statement, the Rio 2016 Olympic Organising Committee expressed respect for labour rights and said it insisted that \u201ccontractors are in compliance with current legislation in Brazil\u201d.</p> <p>It has previously acknowledged security problems in the Olympic Village, which has a workforce of 5,000 people for its 18,000 guests, and controls have been tightened, including repositioning cameras to monitor people as they arrive and leave.</p>",

The goal is to play more football.\u201d</p> <p>Pacy, direct and possessing adhesive control, Watmore has been likened to a young Gareth Bale by Sunderland\u2019s Jermain Defoe, but he knows he cannot afford to tread water. \u201cI\u2019m no longer an unknown quantity,\u201d he says. \u201cThat provides a challenge as you can\u2019t really surprise people very much.

  "<p>Wembley is no place for losers as the saying goes and Marc Sneyd knows that more than most.

With this victory they are assured of a place in the Super 8 play-offs and they also moved nearer to a first League Leader\u2019s Shield in Super League history with four rounds remaining.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re now in effect 80 minutes away from a Grand Final,\u201d Radford said. \u201cTo get the top-four done and dusted so early is great. We\u2019ve got first place to be going for too, so we\u2019ve got to keep this up.\u201d</p> <p>Any fears Hull would be caught cold the week before Wembley were soon put to bed: they led 22-0 at the interval and would run in another 22 points without reply in the second half to emerge comfortable victors.</p> <p>Sneyd had a role in all three of Hull\u2019s first-half tries, with two well-placed kicks causing mayhem in the Catalans backline, allowing Dean Hadley and Mahe Fonua to touch down. The scrum-half followed that up with an exceptional cut-out pass that eventually put Mark Minichiello over for Hull\u2019s third, all of which Sneyd converted before adding two penalties to make it 22-0 at the break.</p> <p>The second half was no better for Catalans, and their coach, Laurent Frayssinous, described the final score as embarrassing. The Dragons were without a whole host of key personnel due to injury but following this defeat, their seventh in eight Super League games, they will be six points adrift of the top four should St Helens beat Wigan on Friday.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s out of our control, the top four,\u201d Frayssinous said. \u201cYou could see how big the gap was between the two teams. It\u2019s all making it really hard for us to make the four at the moment.\u201d</p> <p>Tries from Fetuli Talanoa and Fonua (again) ensured there would be no grand comeback from the Dragons before Sneyd marked a magnificent individual display with a try of his own before converting Frank Pritchard\u2019s solo effort late on.</p>",

Aiba declined to say what Bouzidi\u2019s new role would be. Wu took the decision following an emergency board meeting on Thursday morning.</p> <p>Michael Conlan, the Irish boxer who railed against Aiba after losing against Vladimir Nikitin, said on Wednesday night he believed that the decision may have been punishment because the former Aiba judge Seamus Kelly, who put his name to allegations of fixing in the Guardian, was Irish. \u201cBefore the Olympics we got the bad feeling \u2013 when an ex-Irish [judge] who was part of Aiba came out and kind of outed them,\u201d Conlan told Newstalk\u2019s Off The Ball show.</p> <p>\u201cWe knew they were going to come down hard on us for him having his say.\u201d</p> <p>Following his defeat Conlan had said \u201camateur boxing stinks from the core to the top\u201d and vowed never to fight in an Aiba-sanctioned competition again.</p> <p>Among other contentious bouts were the Russian heavyweight Tishchenko\u2019s heavyweight gold-medal bout victory over Kazakhstan\u2019s Vassiliy Levit and the American Gary Antuanne Russell\u2019s loss in his light middleweight quarter-final to Uzbekistan\u2019s Fazliddin Gaibnazarov.</p> <p>There was further embarrassment for the governing body when its original version of the press release covering Bouzidi\u2019s move said: \u201cAiba&#xa0;...&#xa0;remains fully committed to a zero tolerance policy towards fair play in boxing.\u201d</p>",

Bannon on Friday\u2019s Breitbart News Daily that Breitbart News was one of the few bright spots in generally dismal media coverage of the Brexit debate.</p> <p>\u201cI would like to think and hope that right across the globe, what we\u2019ve done is to prove that people power \u2014 and we need a few good journalists like Breitbart, writing and talking about these things \u2014 but people power <em>can </em>beat the establishment, if they try hard enough,\u201d said Farage.</p> <p>Bannon congratulated Farage, UKIP, and the rest of the Leave coalition for a hard-won \u201cDavid versus Goliath\u201d victory that seemed impossible at the outset, as portrayed by most U.K. and U.S. media. \u201cIt\u2019s just been extraordinary,\u201d said Bannon, who is the Executive Chairman of Breitbart News.</p> <p>\u201cWell, it certainly has been,\u201d Farage agreed. \u201cAnd can I just say a massive thanks to Breitbart, on both sides of the pond? Because you guys have been fair with me, and given me a chance to make my arguments. I thank you guys very much indeed for that.\u201d</p> </blockquote> <p>While Trump has reportedly been receiving Bannon\u2019s counsel for some time, he apparently wasn\u2019t paying too much attention in late June, when he professed ignorance on the Brexit issue but a gut tendency to back Leave.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-08-18T16:11:07.585Z\">at 5.11pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57b5d584e4b0c23bfed8ab1e\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-08-18T15:48:33.577Z\">4.48pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Long-promised <strong>TV ad buys by the Trump campaign</strong> are finally on the books \u2013 but the numbers aren\u2019t overwhelming:</p> <p>UPDATE: the new numbers are bigger:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/Mdixon55/status/766328918831992832\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">.<a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump\">@realDonaldTrump</a> TV buy up to $3.5 million in Fl, NC, OH, and PA. <br><br>$1.3 M of that is Florida.

This morning they have changed their forecast to 348-190 for Clinton, sensing a Democratic drift in the second congressional district in Nebraska, which is one of two states that splits its electoral votes. Do they know what they\u2019re talking about? <a href=\"http://www.centerforpolitics.org/crystalball/articles/clinton-rises-to-348-electoral-votes-trump-drops-to-190/\">You be the judge</a>. Here\u2019s a bit from their analysis:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We are putting Clinton over the 270-mark in the Electoral College (273 electoral votes, to be precise) with states we have classified as Likely Democratic or Safe Democratic. Clinton had previously been at 269 in those categories. To us, this means that Trump has to find a way not just to sweep all Republican states and the remaining states classified Leans Democratic (see our map, below) but to dislodge at least one Likely or Safe Democratic state. Anything can happen over the next dozen weeks, but we wouldn\u2019t recommend betting your children\u2019s college funds on a Trump administration.</p> </blockquote> <p>The Sabato map does not detect any tossup states. That judgment is not unique among pros. The map almost exactly resembles FiveThirtyEight\u2019s <a href=\"http://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2016-election-forecast/?ex_cid=rrpromo#plus\">polls-plus model</a>, which bakes in polling numbers with other fundamentals such as economic stats and historical data.</p> <p>Here\u2019s a basic version of the map (but visit <a href=\"http://www.centerforpolitics.org/crystalball/articles/clinton-rises-to-348-electoral-votes-trump-drops-to-190/\">Sabato\u2019s site</a> for subtleties and analysis):</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"270\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.270towin.com/maps/Eb4Km&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.270towin.com/presidential_map_new/maps/Eb4Km.png&quot; width=&quot;460&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;vertical-align: middle;&quot; src=&quot;http://www.270towin.com/uploads/3rd_party_270_30px.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt; Click the map to create your own at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.270towin.com/maps/Eb4Km&quot;&gt;270toWin.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>If you like electoral college maps but haven\u2019t discovered <a href=\"http://www.270towin.com/\">270towin.com</a> yet, <a href=\"http://www.270towin.com/\">visit them</a>, it\u2019s fun.</p> <p>Update: also <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/paloma/daily-202/2016/08/18/daily-202-why-florida-is-trump-s-best-swing-state/57b50086cd249a2fe363ba26/?postshare=8261471524775146&amp;tid=ss_tw\">read James Hohman in the Washington Post</a> on why Florida is MR BREXIT!\u2019s \u201cbest swing state\u201d:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p><strong>Florida is the only battleground that moved in Trump\u2019s direction after both conventions. </strong><a href=\"http://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2016-election/polls-clinton-running-table-key-battlegrounds-n629136\">Seven states</a> were surveyed by <a href=\"http://www.nbcnews.com/politics/first-read/polls-clinton-ahead-trump-midwest-battlegrounds-n626541\">NBC, the Wall Street Journal and Marist</a> before and after.

ALL women are as reliable as my bible! A book that, much like a women, is incapable of lying!\u201d</p> <p>Schumer initially responded to the backlash by reportedly <a href=\"https://twitter.com/LizArcury/status/765437989921103872?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">blocking women on Twitter</a> who said they were fans and asked that she fire Metzger.

But critics and victims\u2019 advocates have <a href=\"https://viewer.gutools.co.uk/culture/2016/aug/17/amy-schumer-writer-rape-kurt-metzger\">said they were disappointed</a> that the comedian, considered one of the most <a href=\"https://viewer.gutools.co.uk/stage/2015/aug/02/amy-schumer-interview-trainwreck-judd-apatow\">powerful feminist voices in comedy</a>, has not more aggressively denounced Metzger or officially severed ties with him.<br></p> <p>In one of many additional public <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/kurt.metzger/posts/10208046060563346?pnref=story\">Facebook posts</a> since the controversy erupted, Metzger appeared to express regret, saying that he has \u201calways been in defense of the victims of assault\u201d and adding: \u201cI stand by the points I made, but I sincerely apologize for using inflammatory language to make them.\u201d</p> <p>However Metzger showed less contrition in other public Facebook posts, and also appeared to double-down in a series of Facebook message exchanges with a Guardian reporter, sent in the early hours of Thursday morning.</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t fucking complain about the police not helping if you didn\u2019t bother going to the police at all,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/kurt.metzger/posts/10208033140440351\">he said in one of the public posts</a>.</p> <p>\u201cRape is hard to prove. That\u2019s why you can\u2019t dick around on twitter first. Time is of the essence.\u201d Metzger used highly-derogatory language against women before adding that his critics should \u201ctry actually helping victims instead of spotlighting how unique and enlightened you are for being against rape\u201d.</p> <p>In his exchange with the Guardian, Metzger shared messages that, he said, were from rape victims who wrote to him expressing gratitude for his comments. </p> <p>He added: \u201cIm the one who actually cares about victims \u2026 I really dislike this social media groupthink and ill be goddamned if im gonna roll over \u2026 Prosecuting rape on social media is wrong plain and simple.\u201d</p> <p>He also took issue with reports that characterized him as insulting survivors, saying: \u201cI would never mock a rape victim \u2026 I will never stop mocking victim culture \u2026 There is a big fucking difference.\u201d</p> <p>Victims\u2019 advocates have repeatedly noted that there are many reasons survivors of assault do not turn to the police for help. Critics argue that law enforcement often discount women and that the process of a criminal trial <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/11/campus-sexual-assault-university-colorado-austin-wilkerson\">can be re-traumatizing</a> without leading to any meaningful justice or <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jun/06/stanford-sexual-assault-judge-recall\">accountability for offenders</a>.</p> <p>A <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/11/baltimore-police-gender-bias-women-justice-department\">US justice department</a> this month, for example, uncovered that police and prosecutors in Baltimore openly expressed their contempt for a woman who had reported a sexual assault, with one writing that the victim \u201cseems like a conniving little whore\u201d.</p> <p>Metzger \u2013 who has writing credits on 39 episodes of Inside Amy Schumer, including the most recent season finale that aired in June \u2013 has in the past <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2016/aug/17/amy-schumer-writer-rape-kurt-metzger\"> been accused</a> of harassing women online.</p> <p><br></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p>",

An emotional Afaf Nasher, the president of the New York chapter of the Council on American Islamic Relations, fought back tears as she called for a hate crimes investigation.</p> <p>\u201cI applaud the district attorney for upgrading the charges to murder-one however at the same time, we continuously pursue and push for the investigation of hate crimes,\u201d Nasher said. </p> <p>Morel\u2019s first-degree murder charge is a rarity in itself, as it\u2019s usually reserved for people who kill police officers.

After meeting with members of the Bangladeshi community and Islamic leadership council, the Queens district attorney upgraded the charges to first-degree murder, which indicates the crime was intentional and premeditated.</p> <p>What remains uncertain is Morel\u2019s motivations. In court on Tuesday, Morel\u2019s lawyer told the judge his client \u201cdid not make any form of admission\u201d.</p> <p>Also, speaking with the Daily News from Rikers Island jail, Morel <a href=\"http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/alleged-imam-killer-claims-innocence-rikers-wasn-article-1.2755340\">said</a>: \u201cIt wasn\u2019t me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI just want to say I like all types of religions,\u201d he said.</p> <p>On Wednesday night, several Imams, Muslim lawyers and Muslim activists met at a mosque in Jamaica, Queens, to discuss how to respond to the crisis that has shocked their community.</p> <p>The meeting, which was closed to media, was attended by representatives of a variety of different immigrant Muslim groups, as well as African American Muslims. Akonjee\u2019s son was also in attendance.</p> <p>Members remained steadfast in their call for Morel to be charged with a hate crime. But the NYPD chief of detectives Bob Boyce said the motivation of the killer remained a mystery.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a bit of a tough one for us to figure out,\u201d Boyce told reporters on Wednesday.</p> <p>An investigation of Morel\u2019s phone and Facebook account, as well as interviews with friends, have not surfaced any indication that he harbored any hatred towards Muslims, Boyce said.</p> <p>Hate crime convictions have long been a contentious issue for the NYPD and prosecutors. Experts say, prosecutors are hesitant to charge defendants with hate crimes because it is difficult to prove and provides little benefit when pursuing a conviction.</p> <p>\u201cIt is very difficult to establish that a hate crime has occurred,\u201d said Jack Levin, co-director of the Brudnick Center on Violence at Northeastern University and author of The Violence of Hate. He explained that it requires understanding the thinking of a defendant. Also, the charge in the first-degree murder carries the heaviest sentence of life without parole, and therefore an additional hate crime conviction would be additional work with little gain for prosecutors.</p> <p>But the symbolism of a hate crime is important to affected groups and can help indicate trends to encourage legislators to address a wider problem, Levin explained.</p> <p>Morel will appear in court today to enter his plea and will be assigned a homicide lawyer.</p> <p>Ahmed, Akonjee\u2019s son in-law, said they will wait for \u201cthe final result\u201d before making any judgments.</p>",
  "<p>The photograph, a still image drawn from video footage captured by a security camera, shows a mass of cylindrical shapes squashed together in a box and wrapped in what appears to be silver foil, their surfaces glistening like sardines in a tin.<br></p> <p>The shapes are not sardines, however, but human beings.

Don\u2019t be mad at your fans. They love you,\u201d Gomez wrote. </p> <p>An internet tempest ensued, which ended with Bieber deleting his account and, I don\u2019t know, making sea levels rise with the overflow of tears from fans around the world. Then Gomez issued a mea culpa, taking to Snapchat to write, \u201cWhat I said was selfish and pointless.\u201d Yes, girl. 100 emoji. But you shouldn\u2019t have been able to weigh in at all.</p> <p>In the dark ages before broadband and social media, once a couple ended a relationship, typically people were done. Sure, every so often there might be a letter mailed, a phone call made, a text message sent or an email drafted, but nothing that contained the possibility of constant interaction. If you date someone and it doesn\u2019t work out but you keep following their social media accounts, you are prone to see mention of them just about daily.<br></p> <p>Maybe, if you aren\u2019t ready to cut the digital cord, you can mute them on Twitter and unfollow them on Facebook. But when it comes to Instagram, you are stuck with them. You can scroll by, but as Selena Gomez has shown us, you may fall victim to your ex being messy and live for drama on your timeline. </p> <p>I\u2019ve done this plenty of times. Sometimes when you\u2019re done dating a person, they want to \u201cstay friends\u201d, and that includes keeping in touch through social media. I used to agree. Now, to quote the late Whitney Houston, and every black woman I\u2019ve met over the age of 45, \u201cHell to the nah.\u201d As I tend to tell most of the folks I\u2019ve dated in the past: thank you for your services. Fin. </p> <p>What else do we have to talk about? Why do I need to see constant pictures and video of you? What would possess me to follow your random thoughts on the Twitter? </p> <p>I\u2019ll admit that there are some former boo thangs that I\u2019ve occasionally checked up on via social media, but I had the decency to do that after too many drinks and in darkness of my apartment. Why? Because I have just the right amount of shame. Justin Bieber needs to check his supply \u2013 it\u2019s running low.</p> <p>Now I like Selena Gomez, but she was your classic ex acting a smooth fool. Gomez is what the kids would call \u201cmessy boots\u201d. She played right into the <a href=\"http://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/beyonceknowles/donthurtyourself.html\">lyrics</a> of a wise Queen Bey: \u201cWhen you hurt me, you hurt yourself / Don\u2019t hurt yourself, don\u2019t hurt yourself.\u201d</p> <p>Justin, when you get back on Instagram \u2013 and we all know you will, because it\u2019s 2016 and your management team isn\u2019t crazy \u2013 do yourself a favor and block Selena Gomez. If y\u2019all ever get back together, you can unblock her. </p> <p>I extend that same advice to everyone else. Do not play keeping up with the exes on social media. Get rid of them. That is, unless you want to hook up again, but even then, block them right back after they leave. Sometimes petty is just the way to play it.</p>",
  "<p>Two West Mercia police officers are under criminal investigation over the death of the former Premier League footballer Dalian Atkinson, who died after he was Tasered three times by police.</p> <p>The two officers were also being served with gross misconduct notices, the Independent Police Complaints Commission said on Thursday. </p> <p>Some eyewitnesses have also reported that Atkinson was struck by officers while he was on the ground. One woman has already told the BBC that she saw what she believed was Atkinson being kicked by police.</p> <p>The IPCC has stressed its decision to launch a criminal investigation does not mean the officers did anything wrong.</p> <p>The former Aston Villa footballer died after police Tasered him near his father\u2019s home in Telford on Monday.</p> <p>West Mercia police said officers used a Taser at about 1.30am on Monday after responding to reports of concerns for a person\u2019s safety. The man failed to respond to medical attention and was pronounced dead 90 minutes later.<br></p> <p>A postmortem examination was held on Wednesday and the cause of death was inconclusive. Further tests were due to be carried out. The IPCC is liaising with Her Majesty\u2019s coroner.<br></p> <p>The key issues in the criminal investigation will be whether the decision to use force was justified and then whether the level of force was proportionate to Atkinson\u2019s behaviour. <br></p> <p>One officer fired a Taser three times. Whether Atkinson\u2019s behaviour at the time merited this response will be another key part of the inquiry. </p> <p>Atkinson\u2019s family welcomed the decision by the IPCC to launch a criminal investigation. They have hired a law firm expert in cases against the police for deaths in custody and experienced in battling the IPCC to conduct a proper investigation. </p> <p>In a statement the family said: \u201cWe are still in shock as to the circumstances in which Dalian died. We are determined to get justice for him, which means getting to the truth. We welcome the IPCC\u2019s decision that this is a criminal investigation and emphasise their request that there should be no speculation in the media as to what happened to Dalian, as this could prejudice the criminal investigation and any potential prosecution.</p> <p>\u201cWe are looking to the IPCC to carry out a thorough and robust investigation that will ultimately provide transparency and accountability. Dalian\u2019s memory requires nothing less.\u201d</p> <p>Atkinson\u2019s brother, Kenroy, 53, previously said the ex-footballer had undergone dialysis for kidney failure and was \u201cin a manic state and depressed\u201d at the time of the incident. </p> <p>He said his brother had attacked their 85-year-old father, Ernest, at his home before police were called to the scene. </p> <p>The IPCC said it would carry out a full and thorough inquiry.</p> <p>The IPCC commissioner Derrick Campbell said: \u201cHaving carefully considered the evidence gathered so far, we are undertaking a criminal investigation into the circumstances surrounding Mr Atkinson\u2019s death and the level and type of force used. Two police officers will be interviewed under criminal caution by IPCC investigators.<br></p> <p>\u201cAs this is a criminal investigation, the IPCC is limited in the amount of information which can be released into the public domain. I would ask people to be patient during the progress of our investigation and not to add to speculation about the circumstances of Mr Atkinson\u2019s death. Speculation across the media as a whole can risk prejudice to the investigation process.</p> <p>\u201cWe will keep Mr Atkinson\u2019s family updated and our thoughts remain with all of those affected by his death.\u201d</p> <p>In a statement the IPCC added: \u201cTwo West Mercia Police officers have been advised they are under criminal investigation and are also being served with gross misconduct notices. </p> <p>\u201cA criminal investigation does not mean that criminal charges will necessarily follow. </p> <p>\u201cThe IPCC investigation is at an early stage, and the position will be kept under review as the investigation progresses.\u201d </p> <p>Tasers deliver an incapacitating 50,000-volt shock, and critics say the weapon is too often lethal. Its use has been linked to at least 10 deaths in England and Wales over the last decade. In 2013, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2013/jul/11/man-dies-tasered-by-police\">Jordan Lee Begley</a>, 23, died two hours after a Greater Manchester officer targeted him with a stun gun at his home. Police had been called to reports of an argument.</p> <p>Atkinson achieved acclaim for his goal of the season against Wimbledon in 1992 as part of an Aston Villa team that went on to secure the runners-up spot in the first year of the Premier League. He also scored at Wembley in 1994 when Villa beat Manchester United to lift the League Cup.<br></p> <p>He started his career at Ipswich Town and then played for Sheffield Wednesday and the Spanish side Real Sociedad before moving to Villa. He was the first black player for Sociedad, scoring 12 goals in La Liga.<br></p> <p>At Villa he scored more than 20 Premier League goals between 1991 and 1995 before going on to play less successfully for other teams, including the Turkish side Fenerbah\u00e7e and Manchester City.</p>",
  "<p>There was no shame in defeat for Thomas Barr, the Irishman who finished a gallant fourth in the 400m hurdles final won by Kerron Clement of the USA. Barr chiselled the best part of half a second off the personal best and national record he set in qualifying, but came up just short of a podium finish in a race reduced to only seven competitors after Javier Culson from Puerto Rico was disqualified for a false start.</p> <p>\u201cI would be lying if I said I was complaining but I was so close \u2013 0.5 of a second and I think I could have found it,\u201d said Barr. \u201cFourth is the worst place as you are so close.\u201d He was certainly closer than Culson, whose race ended in heartbreak before it began. The twitchy London 2012 bronze medallist was in no doubt it was he who had jumped the gun and hunkered down trackside, sobbing uncontrollably before being led down the tunnel. It was a sorry sight, but meant one less rival to worry about for the 24-year-old Barr, who subsequently ran with a vacant lane three on his immediate inside.</p> <p>A native of Waterford and the first Irishman to qualify for the Olympic 400m final \u2013 or any other sprint final \u2013 since 1932, he was not even sure he would line up at Rio a month ago, having endured a miserable season in which he was sidelined for nearly three months between March and the middle of June with a recurring hip injury. Left with only five weeks to get his body in shape and his stride patterns and rhythm in order, his performance as third-fastest runner in qualifying caused a shock in Ireland.</p> <p>\u201cI had no chance on paper after all my injuries,\u201d he said. \u201cMaybe I should miss three months of training every year. It\u2019s gone crazy back home with big screens, so hello if you are watching.\u201d</p> <p>There have been few Irish highlights during a Games in which the president of the country\u2019s Olympic Council has been arrested and one of the country\u2019s boxers was sent home for failing a drug test. Two silver medals won on water have helped ease the pain, while the sight of a hard-done-by Michael Conlan hoisting his middle finger in the direction of a panel of ringside judges has elevated the boxer to national treasure status.</p> <p>Barr\u2019s efforts in this final were equally commendable, even if his home-straight kick was not strong enough to see him past Turkey\u2019s Yasmani Copello, who finished third behind Clement and the fast-finishing Kenyan Boniface Tumuti.</p> <p>Clement appeared in the video for Beyonce\u2019s Run The World (Girls), in which he says his role was to \u201cjust stand there and be pretty\u201d.</p> <p>He did not loiter here, and won in a time of 47.73sec despite the best attempts of Tumuti to overtake him in the closing stages.</p>",
  "<p>Here is a tip for Sports Direct that could save Mike Ashley a few bob. Rather than bringing in highly-paid consultants to evaluate the company\u2019s board, just ask your shareholders. City institutions would swiftly tell Ashley that Sports Direct needs a credible chairman and a permanent finance director.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>The fact that Sports Direct chose to publicly announce that it will conduct an \u201cexternal evaluation\u201d of its board suggests one problem is already clear. Keith Hellawell is not performing as chairman.</p> <p>The UK corporate governance code stipulates that FTSE companies should appoint a third party to review their board at least every three years, but it is unusual for a company to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/18/sports-direct-vows-to-publish-report-into-staff-working-conditions\">announce the evaluation publicly as Sports Direct did</a>.</p> <p>The company should not need a third party to identify the strengths and weaknesses of its board. The chairman should already know them and the company\u2019s shareholders should be confident that he does.</p> <p>Investors have had concerns about Hellawell\u2019s suitability since he was appointed in November 2009. The former policeman made his name as the chief constable of West Yorkshire and the government\u2019s drugs tsar, but had limited experience of the private sector. <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>At first, such concerns were put to one side because Sport Direct\u2019s share price was rising and the retailer had previously been without a permanent chairman for more than two years after David Richardson, an experienced executive, <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2007/jun/01/retail.frontpagenews\">quit following clashes with the rest of the board</a>.</p> <p>Frustration has grown after criticism of Sport Direct\u2019s working practices, a <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/mar/25/sports-direct-backstreet-outfit-mps-parliamentary-inquiry\">chastening appearance by Hellawell in front of a parliamentary committee last year</a> and <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/sep/25/sports-direct-mike-ashley-43m-punt-tesco-shares\">Ashley buying shares in other retailers such as Tesco and Debenhams</a>. Perhaps most importantly, shares in Sports Direct are now worth less than a third of the 922p peak hit in 2014.</p> <p>The lack of a permanent finance director is a farce and another damning indictment of Hellawell. Bob Mellors stepped down in December 2013 for health reasons, but Sports Direct is yet to appoint a permanent replacement, with Matt Pearson filling the role on an interim basis.</p> <p>The company held its last board evaluation in 2014, but did not publish the findings or make notable changes as a result. That cannot be the case this time. It must revitalise its board. It should replace Hellawell and appoint a permanent finance director.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>It needs to make changes to become a credible investment proposition in the eyes of City institutions, but also to protect the thousands of employees who work for the company. Ashley has pledged to publish the results of an investigation into Sport Direct\u2019s working practices and to make improvements. A strong chairman would ensure this happened.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <h2><strong>Asda takes sensible route in face of </strong><strong>ongoing </strong><strong>sales downturn</strong></h2> <p>The sharp downturn in Asda\u2019s sales shows how quickly momentum can change in the supermarket industry.</p> <p>Less than three years ago, Asda was the first of the \u201cbig four\u201d supermarket chains to react to the rise of the discounters Aldi and Lidl, revealing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/nov/14/asda-fight-rivals-1bn-investment-plan\">plans to cut prices by \u00a31bn over the next few years</a>. It was the best-performing major supermarket chain in the country ahead of Tesco, Sainsbury\u2019s and Morrisons.</p> <p>Now it has <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/18/walmart-asda-rejects-price-war-after-eighth-quarter-of-decline\">reported a 7.5% drop in like-for-like sales</a> for the last three months, its worst-ever quarterly performance and the eighth consecutive drop in quarterly sales.</p> <p>Since Asda made its move in 2013, Tesco, Sainbury\u2019s and Morrisons have all responded, while Aldi and Lidl continue to expand rapidly, the Co-op has revitalised its stores, and Waitrose and Marks &amp; Spencer remain strong upmarket competitors.</p> <p>Asda\u2019s sales have fallen victim to the desire of its US parent company, Walmart, to protect profits in the UK. This has made it vulnerable to aggressive moves from its rivals.</p> <p>The ousting of Asda\u2019s boss Andy Clarke earlier this year suggested that Walmart wanted improvements, but new boy Sean Clarke is unlikely to make dramatic change and launch a new price war. Instead, the strategy will be \u201cfocused on improving the retail basics\u201d, according to Doug McMillon, Walmart\u2019s chief executive. This basically means Asda will focus on keeping its shelves full and costs under control.</p> <p>This is not the drastic response you might expect to a 7.5% fall in sales, but it is sensible. The leading grocery retailers need to move away from their obsession with market share and like-for-like sales, which excludes newly opened or closed stores. Now that the \u201cbig four\u201d are more focused on closing stores than opening them, it is inevitable they will lose market share as the discounters open new outlets across the country and customers buy more on the internet. </p> <p>It is important that the supermarkets remain competitive on price and quality, but a race to the bottom with more steep price cuts would be ruinous and make stores unviable.</p> <p>The \u201cbig four\u201d are already struggling to make their largest stores profitable. It will take years to repair the damage done by opening too many stores, and cutting prices will not solve the underlying problems. Asda and its rivals have a long battle ahead, and there is no easy answer.</p>",

The government intends to continue to protect the food industry and so is ignoring this tragedy of the commons. So much for the promise made by Theresa May when she became Tory leader to \u201c<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/jul/11/andrea-leadsom-apologises-to-theresa-may-politics-live?page=with:block-5783cba5e4b0630007c6b69d#block-5783cba5e4b0630007c6b69d\" title=\"\">unite our country \u2026 not for the privileged few but \u2026 for every one of us</a>\u201d.</p> <p>She has fallen at the first hurdle. She is following Michael Gove\u2019s pre-Brexit advice that \u201c<a href=\"http://unilty.com/uk-has-had-enough-of-experts-says-gove/\" title=\"\">people in this country have had enough of experts</a>\u201d. She has not challenged the might of the food lobby.</p> <p>Predictably the food lobby continues to complain about the nanny state, just as did the tobacco lobby. The government had to be nanny when it introduced anti-smoking laws, vaccination programmes, seatbelt laws, clean air acts and all those other laws that make life worthwhile.</p> <p>The government eventually took on and defeated the smoking lobby. It will have to do the same with the food lobby. The food industry has a big advantage over tobacco in that people will still have to eat, so big food can carry on selling food and making profits, but it will be healthy food. Why are we waiting?<br><strong>Ann and Neil Holmes</strong><br><em>Bromsgrove, Worcestershire</em></p> <p>\u2022 The government\u2019s obesity strategy published today was an opportunity to tackle childhood obesity and household food insecurity that has been missed. While welcoming some positive elements in the strategy, such as the targets for reducing sugar content in food and drink, and the commitment to the <a href=\"https://www.healthystart.nhs.uk/\" title=\"\">Healthy Start scheme</a>, we are dismayed by the government\u2019s lack of ambition.</p> <p>We know from the significant bank of evidence that exists on childhood obesity that in order to tackle it we need limits on food marketing to children, continuation of vital public health schemes, and strong targets for the reduction of childhood obesity. Instead the government\u2019s strategy relies on voluntarism, an approach that has so far failed to make any real inroad into childhood obesity.</p> <p>We need a strategy that can stand up against the major spending power of the big food and drink brands. The seven biggest brands alone spend more than \u00a3300m a year on marketing, over 10 times the amount spent on the government\u2019s flagship healthy eating initiative. But this strategy has failed to deliver.</p> <p>It is time for the government to make a real statement on tackling childhood obesity in the UK. We simply can\u2019t afford not to.<br><strong>Geoff Tansey</strong> <em>Chair, Fabian Commission on Food and Poverty</em><br><strong>Jeanette Orrey</strong> <em>Co-founder, Food for Life</em><br><strong>John Middleton</strong> <em>President, Faculty of Public Health</em></p> <p>\u2022 Expecting the food industry to police itself with regard to junk food is like waiting for the oil industry to tell people not to drive their cars or for arms sellers to advise gun owners not to shoot.</p> <p>Is it too idealistic to hope for a more ethical form of capitalism whereby manufacturers have a moral responsibility to avoid \u2013 or at least limit \u2013 any harm caused through the production and sale of their goods? Given how unlikely this is in a world driven by economic growth and profit margins, we need a government that will exercise the necessary controls to protect citizens from the excesses of the corporate world.<br><strong>Fiona Carnie </strong><br><em>Bath</em></p> <p>\u2022 The UK faces a massive obesity crisis which Action on Sugar says could \u201cbankrupt the NHS\u201d. However, we need to think not just about reducing sugar consumption, but promoting physical activity too.</p> <p>We have invested strategically, and successfully, in promoting Olympic cycling. Yet all over Britain, parents are deterred from allowing their children to cycle to school for fear of road danger.</p> <p>The Dutch spend \u00a324 per person annually on creating a cycle-friendly environment, and 49% of pupils there cycle to school. By contrast, the UK government proposes investment in its draft <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/512895/cycling-and-walking-investment-strategy.pdf\" title=\"\">Cycling and Walking Investment Strategy</a> (CWIS) of just \u00a32 per person next year, falling to a paltry 72p by 2020. It\u2019s hardly surprising that 1% of school trips in Britain are cycled, and our obesity rates are significantly higher.</p> <p>As part of its obesity plan, shouldn\u2019t the government use some of its sugar tax revenues for enabling non-athletes of all ages to cycle safely for day-to-day journeys? That would be a hugely cost-effective way not only to tackle obesity, but also congestion, air pollution and climate change. By creating people-friendly streets and communities, it would surely be a fantastic vote-winner too.<br><strong>Roger Geffen</strong><br><em>Policy director, Cycling UK </em></p> <p>\u2022 The government has started consulting on the introduction of a tax on sugary drinks. We are already seeing marketing for sugar-free drinks as being healthier than the originals, and they will now be cheaper. But there is no evidence that artificial sweeteners are healthier than sugar, so we can help the manufacturers with their marketing while doing nothing to improve children\u2019s health.<br><strong>Michael Peel</strong><br><em>Winscombe, Somerset </em></p> <p><strong><em>\u2022 Join the debate \u2013 email </em></strong><a href=\"mailto:guardian.letters@theguardian.com\" title=\"\"><strong><em>guardian.letters@theguardian.com</em></strong></a></p>",

  "<p>Back when I was a university undergraduate in Ye Olde England, my dorm room had an Ikea lamp, lots of pretentious books and a pretentious vintage rock band poster.

They\u2019ve been taught that college can be a premium experience, and both private companies and colleges are lining up to serve it to them. Colleges, in general, have gone from stark study centers to country-club like experiences. MIT has a ball pit; Boston University has a climbing wall; Rutgers University\u2019s $55m Rockoff dorm features a Coldstone Creamery and a state-of-the-art gym.</p> <p>Developers have also started investing billions in off-campus dorms. A recent <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-03-07/off-campus-college-dorms-now-resemble-spring-break-hotels\">Bloomberg analysis</a> of 94 student housing complexes across the US found that 80% had access to a swimming pool, 55% lived in properties with on-site tanning salons, while 45% have beach volleyball courts. Just 38% offered dedicated study rooms.</p> <p>Dorm decor, it seems, has become a competitive sport in educational institutions across the country. And while Goodson and Bozeman may be the current reigning queens, plenty of other people are taking part. There are 68,296 #dormroom photos on Instagram, and scrolling through them reveals a few things about the new generation of college kids\u2019 things. Here\u2019s what I learned. </p> <p><strong>Typography &amp; ampersands</strong><br></p> <p>I don\u2019t know what the Helvetica is going on but typography is very hot right now and dorm rooms seem to have become a fount of fonts. What\u2019s more, empirical Instagram evidence suggests that the <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BJJZcUcjvRz/\">ampersand</a> is having a moment. </p> <p><strong>Inspirational phrases</strong></p> <p>Most of the time these don\u2019t even appear to be ironic. Rather they say things like \u201cYou\u2019re not a pigeon you\u2019re a unicorn\u201d in elaborate typography. You may think inspirational phrases are trite but keep calm and you can carry them off.</p> <p><strong>All matching everything</strong></p> <p>Thanks to social media, dorm mates are connecting and coordinating before they even meet.

  "<p>Oliver Stone looks overwhelmed. It is May 2015, and we are in Munich on the penultimate day of shooting his drama about Edward Snowden. At lunch, the director seems anxious and weary, eyes heavy, shoulders stooped, energy sapped. When the idea of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QlSAiI3xMh4\">Snowden</a> was proposed, he explains, he had strongly resisted. Then, slowly and reluctantly, he was drawn in. Today, he sounds as if he might regret that decision. There have been problems with finance, with finding distributors, in portraying something as dull as the cyberworld that Snowden inhabits.</p> <p>\u201cA director has to say everything is great, things are wonderful,\u201d he says, exasperated. \u201cEvery day on a set is a potential disaster. Every day on a film set is the hope that it is turning out well, but the truth is it is just a slog all the way through. It\u2019s the bulldozer going through a treeline. It is not easy. It has never been easy.\u201d</p> <p>This film, in particular, was not easy. \u201cEvery movie I have made is a challenge. But from day one, every day seems to have its obstacles, whether it is computers or the technology being arcane, difficult to understand, or the character of Snowden, who has a strong, robot, nerd quality. It is a drawback. He is not the active type.\u201d As Stone headed back to the set, his final comment expressed his limited ambition for the movie at that time: \u201cI don\u2019t want to do anything that will hurt Edward Snowden.\u201d</p> <p>Almost a year later, I meet Stone again, in London. The tiredness is gone. This is a man full of enthusiasm for life and his movie. The editing has gone well, he feels; the previous week a positive reaction had met an early preview in Idaho \u2013 despite his sense of dread.</p> <p>\u201cAs a director, I think the film has a power beyond its details,\u201d he says, beaming. \u201cMaybe no one will come. But those people that come will see something they have not seen before. There are no chases. There are no murders. I love tension but there is a different kind of tension \u2026 What Snowden did in history, I believe, will make a difference. I don\u2019t think it is going to go away.\u201d</p> <p>It was a few months after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/the-nsa-files\">the story first broke in summer 2013</a> that Stone was approached by Anatoly Kucherena, Snowden\u2019s lawyer in Russia, about making a movie about his client. It caught him, he says, at a low point. A project about Martin Luther King had failed to come to fruition. He didn\u2019t fancy embarking on another complicated proposition unlikely to make it to the multiplex. Nonetheless, he went to Moscow, met the man himself, and was sufficiently intrigued to do further research and <a href=\"http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/oliver-stone-options-novel-by-710699\">buy up film rights to Kurcherena\u2019s fictional account of an American whistleblower, Time of the Octopus</a>, as well as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/feb/13/snowden-files-luke-harding-review\">Guardian correspondent Luke Harding\u2019s The Snowden Files</a>.</p> <p>I first met Stone six or so months later, when he visited the Guardian. I was called into the office of the then-editor, Alan Rusbridger, and was pleased at the prospect, never having met a Hollywood director before. This was also one whose films I had enjoyed. There were a handful of us in the room and we chatted for about hour. The reason I was there was that, along with <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHVO6XL-b7U\">fellow journalists Laura Poitras and Glenn Greenwald</a>, I had met Snowden in Hong Kong, where he handed over tens of thousands of top-secret US and British documents to us \u2013 one of the biggest leaks in intelligence history \u2013 before going into hiding. Stone wanted to hear the account firsthand. At that point, I wasn\u2019t sure what to make of the director, but I was impressed by the detail he had already accumulated about Snowden.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bed9db441ad6e43b5c415785afa78aa8eccfd488\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bed9db441ad6e43b5c415785afa78aa8eccfd488/0_405_6016_3611/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Oliver Stone on the set of his film Snowden\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Oliver Stone on the set of his film Snowden.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: J\u00fcrgen Olczyk</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I met him next in December 2014, alone over lunch in London. I was half-an-hour late but he did not make a fuss: there was nothing of primadonna to him. Instead, he cracked on with his questions. There were a lot of them. They were followed up with emails and phone calls. I liked this obsessiveness, more journalist than film director; a stubborn pursuit of the unanswered in an effort to complete a picture. In the end, Stone and his co-writer Kieran Fitzgerald interviewed almost everyone involved. He spoke to lawyers, journalists and former members of the NSA. He went to the Ecuadorean embassy in London to talk to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange. And he met Snowden\u2019s partner, Lindsay Mills. He went to Moscow at least eight times to meet Snowden.</p> <p>Too much research, Stone says. About 80% had to be ditched. Not time wasted though, he says \u2013 it gave him the clarity he hankered after. We are now back in Munich, two days after the UK general election: a time of great industry and excitement in a newspaper. Filming, by contrast, is boring. I had never been on a movie set before and I am glad I had the chance to see behind the scenes. But I had somehow imagined it might be a bit like a stage performance. It was not. The experience is dull and repetitive. That morning was dominated by Stone shooting Joseph Gordon-Levitt, who plays Snowden, looking out of a hotel window. This was meant to be in Hong Kong; Snowden\u2019s bedroom at the Mira hotel having been recreated in Germany. Gordon-Levitt was filmed looking left to right and then down to the street. Over and over again. Different lighting. Different angles. Different shots. The scene makes it into the movie but only lasts a few seconds. It took four hours.</p> <p>When not looking out of glass, Gordon-Levitt was happy to chat. By then, he had already met Edward and was accurately reproducing his slow, precise speech. The son of west coast liberals, he had fostered an intense interest in Snowden and the arguments around surveillance. Unafraid of public declarations of political intent, Gordon-Levitt was preparing to be an advocate for privacy issues in the press commitments ahead. He has already donated his earnings from the movie to the American Civil Liberties Union, one of whose lawyers is Snowden\u2019s chief representative.</p> <p>Watching the shooting in the mocked-up Hong Kong hotel, I spotted on Snowden\u2019s cluttered table an empty can of Tsingtao beer. But there were never any empties in that room. None of us was drinking at the time; Snowden is teetotal. But I didn\u2019t have the heart to mention it because it was already so far into the shooting and the idea of subjecting them to more hours reshooting felt unimaginable. In the end, though, I can\u2019t remember seeing the stubbie in the final cut.</p> <p>There are other, bigger quibbles. Parts of the film are pure Hollywood. Stone devotes much of the movie to the romance between Snowden and Mills. The way Snowden smuggles data out of the NSA headquarters in Hawaii in a Rubik\u2019s Cube is almost certainly the stuff of thriller fantasy. It is also a straightforward biopic, following Snowden from a failed attempt to join US special forces to a successful career as an NSA computer specialist, through disillusionment and then to being a whistleblower.</p> <p>Yet the broad direction of Snowden is more faithful to the truth than might be expected from Hollywood. Stone is quick to insist he is not a political director or an activist, but a dramatist. A surprise to me, maybe to others also familiar with his work. Yet perhaps what he meant was that he does not want to make anything that would be dull. The film isn\u2019t. But I\u2019m an interested party: I\u2019m depicted in it, and so I hope it does well.</p> <p>I\u2019m most interested in the film\u2019s capacity to shift public opinion about the man whose story it portrays. Attitudes in the US tend to be polarised between those who view him as a traitor and those who see him as a hero. Stone\u2019s film can reach people with little prior knowledge. It humanises its subject, makes complex arguments about the balance between privacy and surveillance immediately understandable. Even those who argue that they are not bothered about potential intrusion into the private lives will likely squirm at a scene in which the central couple are having sex \u2013 but then Snowden hesitates, spotting an open laptop, wondering if anyone might be watching through the webcam. (The incident is based on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jul/18/-sp-edward-snowden-interview-rusbridger-macaskill\">an interview with the Guardian</a> in which Snowden said surveillance agencies do engage in such voyeurism.)</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7942fde07c7fbbf280430de21c40fbdb25a6f5d9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7942fde07c7fbbf280430de21c40fbdb25a6f5d9/0_0_2048_1367/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Joseph Gordon-Levitt as Edward Snowden and Shailene Woodley as his girlfriend Lindsay Mills in Snowden\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Joseph Gordon-Levitt as Edward Snowden and Shailene Woodley as his girlfriend Lindsay Mills in Snowden.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/Open Road Films</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Will Snowden shift opinion? \u201cI hope so,\u201d Stone says, a touch uncertain. \u201cIt is tricky,\u201d he qualifies. In fact, his film may give some of the more zealous anti-surveillance campaigners pause for thought. One of the more unexpected subtleties in the film comes with its portrayal of the NSA, where differing views about the balance between privacy and security are permitted \u2013 embraced, even.</p> <p>\u201cEd never revealed real people to us,\u201d said Stone. \u201cBut he gave us ideas about real people and events from which we could draw and make \u2013 with dramatic licence \u2013 conclusions that would not be too far-fetched. We tried over many drafts to make it as realistic as possible.</p> <p>\u201cThe NSA have human souls,\u201d he added. \u201cThey are not all James Bond villains.\u201d He was not smiling; he meant it.</p> <p>Yet his own allegiances lie with the whistleblower; his undoubted aim is to caution the unaware about what he calls \u201cthe surveillance state\u201d. \u201cI think we are all facing problems of an Orwellian super\u2013organisation that is running the world,\u201d he says. \u201cBut that is politics!\u201d He is disappointed that the issue has surfaced so little in the US election campaign so far \u2013 its sole appearance at that point was in a Democratic candidates\u2019 debate. Stone backed Bernie Sanders (and is also a fan of Jeremy Corbyn). \u201cHillary Clinton has no mercy in her soul for Snowden,\u201d he says, also murmuring uneasily about her \u201chardcore warmongering tactics\u201d.</p> <p>Snowden will be released in the US two months before a new president is elected, and a day after Stone\u2019s 70th birthday. Its fate will be decided then. But what of the most important opinion, that of Snowden himself? His instinct when he worked at the NSA was to keep a low profile \u2013 presumably he would have been mortified at the prospect of a movie about him. And he remains an essentially private person, happy to talk about technology and surveillance, but guarding details about his own life. The world of the celebrity is not one he would be comfortable with.</p> <p>Stone hints that Snowden liked the movie \u2013 and his cooperatation suggests he is onside. His real pleasure in it, though, may be like mine. In April, the trailer was released. Snowden tweeted: \u201cFor two minutes and 39 seconds, everybody at NSA just stopped working.\u201d</p> <h2>His accent is good, if more Edinburgh than my Glasgow glottal stop</h2> <p><strong>Ewen MacAskill meets Tom Wilkinson, the man who plays him in Snowden</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c86b87fcd5907e9f2b65a471f81697bb3244387c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c86b87fcd5907e9f2b65a471f81697bb3244387c/0_118_3504_2103/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tom Wilkinson as Ewen MacAskill in Snowden\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tom Wilkinson as Ewen MacAskill in Snowden.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/Open Road Films</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>After seeing the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/oct/16/citizen-four-review-edward-snowden-documentary\">Oscar-winning movie Citizenfour</a>, a Guardian colleague offered up his verdict: \u201cThe guy playing you is rubbish.\u201d It was a joke, I hope; the guy playing me is me, as Citizenfour is a documentary.</p> <p>Released in 2014, Citizenfour recorded a meeting between NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden with three journalists, Laura Poitras, Glenn Greenwald and myself, in Hong Kong in 2013. Oliver Stone\u2019s Snowden is different. Actors take most of the roles, including Tom Wilkinson as me.</p> <p>Throughout my career, I have been comfortable with a low profile, hiding behind print. That has not survived the Snowden story, which has so far spawned three plays, several documentaries and now a Hollywood movie.</p> <p>My part in all of them is relatively small. Even so, the first time I went to see myself played by an actor \u2013 Jonathan Coy, in<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2014/apr/23/privacy-review-donmar-warehouse-london\"> James Graham\u2019s Privacy at the Donmar Warehouse in 2014</a> \u2013 I felt a mixture of both embarrassment and dread, not least because <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2014/apr/23/relief-portrayal-privacy-new-play-james-graham\">I had to write about it</a>. But Coy did a good job and I began to relax after he delivered the first of his lines. I had met the actor before on what I thought was a social occasion \u2013 in fact, he was scoping me, picking up mannerisms.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2014/apr/23/relief-portrayal-privacy-new-play-james-graham\">Fear, then relief, at my portrayal in new play Privacy</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It gave me a strange taste for this strangest experience. When I flew to Munich to visit the set of Snowden, two things were uppermost in my mind. The first: would my small role survive the final cut? The second: would I keep my Scottish accent? Stone might have opted for American, or even English.</p> <p>In a break on set during a thunderstorm, I met the man playing me: Tom Wilkinson. He confirmed he stuck with Scottish. \u201cIt is always an accent I have never had any problems with,\u201d he said. \u201cI am good with accents in a way and Scottish is apparently one of them.\u201d And his accent is good, if a little more Edinburgh than my Glasgow glottal stop. Plus, he refers to Snowden in the movie as \u201claddie\u201d. Not a term I would ever employ.</p> <p>One of the biggest differences between being portrayed on stage and on film is that the language in the play was mine, recorded verbatim, while that in Snowden is invented.</p> <p>At one point in the real meeting in the Mira hotel, Snowden covered himself and his laptop with a red hood. He wanted to hide his password from any hidden cameras, he explained later. Even at the time it seemed odd behaviour and myself and Glenn are caught in Citizenfour exchanging puzzled, uneasy glances.</p> <p>In the movie, I offer up a quip as Snowden pulls the hood over his head, something like, \u201cDo we all get under that?\u201d, which I did not say. Stone repeatedly stressed to me he was making a movie and had to make it interesting. Me just taking notes in a chair, he said kindly, just wasn\u2019t particularly exciting. He needed action.</p> <p>There\u2019s another striking line in which I call the Guardian to tell them that \u201cThe Guinness is good\u201d \u2013 a pre-arranged signal that the whistleblower was genuine, not a crank. In fact, I did say that in real life. And, oddly, it was scripted, the brainchild of then-Guardian US editor Janine Gibson, who is played here by Joely Richardson.</p> <p>The film shows me nodding off. This is accurate, too \u2013 but it happened later than the scenes shown. Neither Glenn, Laura or myself got much sleep for a week. It was only when Snowden went into hiding that I began to relax and started falling asleep all over the place.</p> <p>As for Wilkinson, he was less exercised by the themes behind the film than his director or co-star, but he recalled with excitement the coverage in the Guardian when the story broke, and is sympathetic towards the man. \u201cI don\u2019t think he is a traitor,\u201d he says, quiet and considered. \u201cYou need someone like that. I think all people who put themselves out on a limb to the extent to which he has have a simplicity of outlook that eludes the rest of us.\u201d</p> <p>Earlier in the summer, I saw a preview of the film with my colleague Luke Harding, on whose book much of the movie is based. Afterwards, I asked him how accurate he felt the Wilkinson portrayal was. A fearless foreign correspondent confronting the powerful forces of the US and British intelligence services \u2013 right? Luke\u2019s verdict: \u201cYou looked a bit dopey.\u201d</p> <p><em>\u2022 Snowden premieres at the Toronto film festival on 10 September, opens in the US on 16 September and in the UK later in the year</em></p>",
  "<p>Sir Robin Chichester-Clark, who has died aged 88, was the epitome of the \u201cbig house\u201d unionists who dominated political and public life in Northern Ireland in the decades after partition in 1922. He represented Londonderry in the House of Commons from 1955 until 1974 and earned the distinction of being the only member of his party to serve at any ministerial level in a British government. While in opposition he held several shadow posts under <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2005/jul/18/guardianobituaries.conservatives\" title=\"\">Edward Heath</a>, who appointed him minister of state for employment in his 1970 administration.</p> <p>Until 1966, the Ulster Unionists held all 12 Northern Ireland seats at Westminster but the election of the nationalist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2005/aug/26/obituaries.uk\" title=\"\">Gerry Fitt</a> in West Belfast that year fractured the longstanding monopoly and signalled the beginning of a new and more turbulent era for unionism.</p> <p>Since partition, there had been a \u201cconvention\u201d that Northern Ireland affairs were not discussed in London, an arrangement that suited Whitehall ministers and officials wary of any contact that might ignite the ever-glowing embers of crisis in Belfast.</p> <p>But, with the private encouragement of the Labour prime minister, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/1995/may/25/obituaries\" title=\"\">Harold Wilson</a>, and the vociferous support of a cadre of Labour MPs formed into the <a href=\"http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/events/crights/nicra/nicra781.htm\" title=\"\">Campaign for Democracy in Ulster</a>, Fitt challenged the prevailing order, raising long-held grievances about voting rights, religious discrimination and other contentious issues.</p> <p>As leader of the unionist MPs it fell to the innately moderate Chichester-Clark to defend his party\u2019s partisan record. Having lost the fight to save the convention, he and his colleagues secretly consulted the RUC inspector-general, seeking material from special branch to discredit Fitt, whom they had come to regard as an IRA agitator. In the end Chichester-Clark appeared quite a woeful figure in the Commons when he could only cite Fitt\u2019s preference for an Irish passport as evidence of his subversive leanings.</p> <p>When the campaign for civil rights in Northern Ireland accelerated after a violent encounter between marchers and the RUC in October 1968, Chichester-Clark, as the Conservative spokesman on NI affairs, had the impossible task of defending the increasingly repressive security policies being pursued in Belfast and countering the universal scorn of the Commons, where the need for urgent and far-reaching reform at Stormont was now accepted on both sides of the house.</p> <p>Given the traditional unionist links with the Conservative party, Chichester-Clark was first disappointed and then disillusioned as even the moderate unionist case for gradual reform he advocated was comprehensively rejected. His hurt was all the more acute because his older brother, James, the Stormont prime minister between 1969 and 1971, later made a life peer as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2002/may/20/guardianobituaries.northernireland\" title=\"\">Lord Moyola</a>, was struggling to advance cautious reform against the stridency of his uncompromising party hardliners and a backdrop of intensifying civil disorder.</p> <p>When Heath became prime minister in 1970 and refused to ease the pressure for reform at Stormont, Chichester-Clark\u2019s credibility and influence was further undermined</p> <p>After Stormont was prorogued in <a href=\"http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/events/aia/bac.htm\" title=\"\">favour of direct rule from Westminster in 1972</a>, and the government held fruitless talks with the IRA in London, he felt completely betrayed. When his government then entered into the <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/december/9/newsid_2536000/2536767.stm\" title=\"\">Sunningdale agreement</a> with the Irish Republic in 1973, his disillusion was complete.</p> <p>With discontent growing among his constituency party members in Northern Ireland, Chichester-Clark decided to get out before he was disowned, but his failure to secure an alternative Conservative candidacy in Britain to contest the 1974 general election finally ended his political life. He was knighted later that year.</p> <p>Named Robert, but known as Robin, he was born at Moyola Park, the family\u2019s sprawling ancestral estate at Castledawson, Co Derry, at the foot of the Glenshane Pass. His father, James Lenox-Conyingham Clark and mother, Marion (nee Chichester), had changed their names by deed poll in 1924 to the simpler Chichester-Clark. He had two siblings, James and Penelope.</p> <p>Robin was initially educated at home by governesses but later was sent to Selwyn House prep school near Broadstairs, Kent. For part of his time there, the school was evacuated to Wales. When he left in 1940 he enrolled at the Royal Naval College, Dartmouth, before reading law and history at Magdalene College, Cambridge.</p> <p>He first worked in journalism then public relations, representing Glyndebourne Opera in 1952-53. He joined the Oxford University Press, where he remained until, following in the footsteps of his father and grandfather, becoming the MP for Londonderry in 1955.</p> <p>After leaving politics, Chichester-Clark set up as a management consultant and was active at board level with a broad range of organisations, both commercial and artistic. He was also involved in fundraising for the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra.</p> <p>He is survived by his second wife, Caroline (nee Bull), whom he married in 1974, and their two sons, Adam and Thomas; and by three children, Emma, Mark and Sophia, from his first marriage, to Jane (nee Goddard), which ended in divorce.</p> <p>\u2022 Robert (Robin) Chichester-Clark, politician, born 10 January 1928; died 5 August 2016</p>",
  "<p>Earlier this week, according to Twitter, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/miley-cyrus\">Miley Cyrus</a> died. \u201cWhat an awful thing to wake up this morning and one of the first things you see is <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%23RIPMileyCyrus&amp;src=typd\">#RIPMileyCyrus</a>!\u201d <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ThePerezHilton/status/765176194425688065\">tweeted Perez Hilton</a>. \u201cMy heart sank! THANKFULLY she\u2019s fine!!\u201d. Having spent most of the day near the top of Twitter\u2019s list of worldwide trends \u2013 so often in 2016 a morbid roll call of genuine celebrity deaths \u2013 it took a while for people to work out how and why a hashtag proclaiming the death of a very much alive pop star had captured people\u2019s imagination. The answer? Fan wars.</p> <p>Twitter has tended to be a safe-ish medium for pop stars to manipulate when they have something to promote, with the more rabid fans (or \u201cstans\u201d) encouraged to get things trending in order to unlock \u201cexclusive content\u201d. Increasingly, however, hashtags are being used by groups of fans \u2013 \u201cfandoms\u201d \u2013 not to promote stars, but as weapons in the murky world of online wars. Various fandoms, used to feeding off the thrill of interacting with their idols, and emboldened by being grouped together and named (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/lady-gaga\">Lady Gaga</a>\u2019s Little Monsters, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/justin-bieber\">Justin Bieber</a>\u2019s Beliebers, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/rihanna\">Rihanna</a>\u2019s Navy), have decided to make their own entertainment. Namely, they start Twitter \u201cparties\u201d that prematurely celebrate the end of a pop star\u2019s career (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/charlieputhisoverparty?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Ehashtag\">#CharliePuthIsOverParty</a> trended on Wednesday after the singer allegedly replied to a fan with the word \u201cdie\u201d).</p> <p>So what brought about Cyrus\u2019s Twitter-only death? The hashtag was <a href=\"http://www.inquisitr.com/3420254/miley-cyrus-racist-twitter-exo-kpop-trend-ripmileycyrus/\">traced back to a fallout between fans of Bieber and those of K-Pop boyband Exo</a>. Both said their idols were more popular after the two performed on the same night in separate venues. A fan of Cyrus, perhaps noticing an opportunity to throw the cat in among the already excitable pigeons, made some fairly derogatory comments about K-pop fans, and the hashtag emerged shortly after (as with most of these trending hashtags, it\u2019s unclear exactly who started it; some K-pop fans even accused Cyrus fans of doing it to make them look bad).</p> <p>K-pop fan Ram, whose tweets trying to explain the whole sorry situation were retweeted nearly 700 times, thinks these new, more chaotic fan wars are a demonstration of loyalty. \u201cI don\u2019t know about other fandoms, but here in the K-pop fandom if you see someone bashing your idols you should stand up and defend them,\u201d she says. \u201cI feel like my fandom is my family. They\u2019re people you love and you should defend people you love. Them being happy is important to us.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c4690d6280bff622b62b2569f5969bd3bef4ff3d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c4690d6280bff622b62b2569f5969bd3bef4ff3d/0_0_2992_2323/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Justin Bieber and Selena Gomez in 2012.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"776\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Justin Bieber and Selena Gomez in 2012.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PictureGroup/Rex Features</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Another soldier of the short-lived #RIPMileyCyrus Twitter war was Jorge Flores, a K-pop fan from Baytown, Texas. Like Ram, he was moved to act by a need to defend the honour of his idols. \u201cThe K-pop community is definitely a family,\u201d he says, citing Twitter as the only way someone from a small US Midwest town has of interacting with his idols. \u201cWe argue here and there about small stuff, but when someone attacks any of us, we gather together and put people in their place. The positive thing about being part of a fan army is that you always have someone watching your back \u2013 we have a shoulder to lean on, and someone to cry with who understands where we are coming from. We are supporting our idols, too. When they are having a hard time, we step in and make them feel better, and fight off any negativity.\u201d</p> <p>Another fan \u201cfighting off negativity\u201d is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/selena-gomez\">Selena Gomez</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/taylor-swift\">Taylor Swift</a> fan Sean Arcilla, who lives in the Philippines. More a messenger of peace, Arcilla\u2019s aim is to spread unity, one hashtag at a time. \u201cFirst of all, fans with hatred in their hearts started these hashtags,\u201d he says. \u201cSome people are joining in because they want to defend their affected idol, but some people are just making fun of it, and enjoying tweeting the hashtag so it will trend easily. I miss the old days, to be honest.\u201d</p> <p>For Bradley Stern, editor-in-chief of <a href=\"http://popcrush.com/\">the PopCrush website</a>, these hashtags are part of the fans\u2019 sense of entitlement in an age of direct digital access. \u201cThis all lends itself to the false notion, especially by young fans, that we are owed something from these people,\u201d he says. \u201cThe air of mystery has now entirely gone as a result, as more and more pop stars attempt to cultivate this relatable brand of interaction with their fans. So we\u2019re invited to feel this false sense of intimacy because <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/jun/09/nick-jonas-last-year-was-complicated-review-single-sad-and-highly-sexed-pop\">Nick Jonas</a> tweeted you directly with a winky face, for example.\u201d Arcilla, however, sees things differently. \u201cI am a fan of Selena and Taylor, but if I\u2019m owed something from them, then what is it? It\u2019s the music. The speeches. The help they give to us fans. If they make a mistake then I will prove to them that a mistake is only a mistake.

Some fans seem to want to cause online chaos to get the attention their slightly wary idols are now not so keen to give them. \u201cI think celebrities are starting to distance themselves from the voices of their stan communities, which maybe drives some people to come up with something so controversial that the artist is forced to speak out,\u201d says David Monger, creator of popstar parody YouTube channel <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/GingerTheHorse\">The Nekci Menij Show</a>. \u201cAt this point, things move so quickly you have maybe a few hours to get your campaign going by any means necessary. It\u2019s an environment where attention is the most valued commodity, and if you\u2019re trending, I guess you\u2019re rich.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/aug/16/justin-bieber-quits-instagram-selena-gomez\">Justin Bieber quits Instagram after feud with Selena Gomez</a> </p> </aside>  <p>One recently trending topic, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/sorryjustinbieber\">#SorryJustinBieber</a> \u2013 started after Bieber closed down his Instagram account following a spat with ex-girlfriend Selena Gomez (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/justindeactivatedparty?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Ehashtag\">#JustinDeactivatedParty</a>) \u2013 was actually used as a trap by Bieber\u2019s fans. Rather than showing a stream of tweets apologising, it was full of anger at Bieber for daring to close his Instagram account in the first place (shutting down a social media account, a fan\u2019s best way into your world, is tantamount to slamming a door in their face). \u201cI think there are a certain amount of fans who love their favourite artists so much, they are actually mean to them. It\u2019s almost the same as making fun of your sibling, in a way,\u201d says Stern. \u201cYou love them, but you\u2019re allowed to pick on them because you really \u2018get\u2019 them. And that can get scary.\u201d For Flores, it\u2019s a fan\u2019s only way of showing the pop star how their behaviour affects them, even if it means grabbing their attention under false pretences. \u201cWhen a fandom is hurt, they will literally try anything to get the message across to their idol.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b866a43caf724607fdf15bb5871f36b7fb4a121c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b866a43caf724607fdf15bb5871f36b7fb4a121c/0_53_4352_2814/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Demi Lovato.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"647\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Demi Lovato.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: RMV/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In the days of 80s and 90s pop megastars, it was fairly easy to gauge how successful they were using sales figures, chart placings and ticket sales. Now the water is murkier, with the less controllable world of social media playing a crucial role in galvanising a fanbase into streaming songs, watching videos and showing off their loyalty, with sites such as Billboard running online competitions to find out \u201c<a href=\"http://www.billboard.com/fan-army-bracket/\">Whose Army is the Strongest?</a>\u201d. With fans conditioned to monitor their idol\u2019s every movement, there\u2019s a real sense of investment that heightens the scrutiny the pop star finds themselves under. Earlier this week, for example, singer Demi Lovato\u2019s mum posted a video on Snapchat in which she made a joke about the Zika virus. Demi could be heard laughing in the background. Within minutes the hashtag <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%23DemiLovatoIsOverParty\">#DemiLovatoIsOverParty</a> was trending, <a href=\"http://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/celebrity-news/demi-lovato-forced-apologise-after-8625740\">leading to an apology from Lovato</a>. \u201cNowadays, one dodgy comment can literally end your career,\u201d Monger says. \u201cThese \u2018party\u2019 hashtags are a massive exaggeration, but in that moment, fans might feel like that person has just alienated their whole fanbase permanently.\u201d For rival fandoms looking to stick the knife in, such slip-ups are seized upon. \u201cPop fans have never been thirstier to police and label someone problematic or petty or shady, because above all else, it provides them with some added entertainment,\u201d Stern says.</p> <p>As with most things in pop, there\u2019s a sense of transience, with thetrend of pop-star-bashing hashtag \u201cparties\u201d hopefully a fad that will die out. The trending hashtags usually only last a couple of hours, with their shelf life only extended by confused fans trying to work out the conversation or people jumping on the bandwagon. \u201cA Twitter trend explodes and disappears, and then another rises up,\u201d Stern says. \u201cThe cycle continues.\u201d Somewhere along the line, however, that cycle has morphed, with the passion that\u2019s always been at the heart of pop now strangely mutated.</p>",

Forget the pink pound \u2013 the first rule of 21st-century icondom is that you don\u2019t alienate the hate dollar.

Doubtless Kim will still have her unsolicited intellectual backers among those who think they wish to create a better world for women and girls, but are really just useful idiots. I never quite remember how this one goes exactly, but I think I\u2019m on the right lines if I explain to you that Kim is owning her own reality or something? And her truth? She is owning her own truth. I think she is also telling her own truth, and that is an inherently feminist act, even if it is by the medium of arse snaps. Above all, she is a successful businesswoman \u2013 an achievement apparently so unique and ultra-modern that the nature of the product is a sublime irrelevance.</p> <p>Of course, there will be some of you old-fashioned worrywarts out there who feel they can only regard Kim as a highly paid shill for Big Sexting, a role for which she is perfectly suited given her defining characteristic is a relentlessly mercenary form of sub-clinical narcissism. And you might even have concerns about that, given that a huge percentage of her fanbase is impressionable teens.</p> <p>But listen: what you need to understand is that there really is no material, blindingly obvious difference between when Kim\u2019s taking selfies for wider consumption in her $3m bathroom and when your 13-year-old daughter\u2019s doing it in yours. Or, indeed, it\u2019s being done by a 13-year-old girl you don\u2019t even know, whose entire street is worth very much less than $3m. As the Kim she looks up to would doubtless explain, that kid is Owning Her Own Reality. Anyone using her body in this way is living her truth, and the mere act of sexting effectively puts them in control of their own personal media empire. Right now its sole output is pictures of their tits sent to some teenage boy who really doesn\u2019t understand the stakes, but hey. We all have to start somewhere on the ladder, right? They are owning their own truth and their own reality. What need have they of labels such as feminist, daughter, or even woman?

She and seven other presenters have been deemed by their employer to be too overweight to appear on camera and suspended for a month.</p> <p>They have been given an ultimatum: lose weight or lose your job.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s unfair,\u201d Khattab told the Guardian. \u201cIt\u2019s discriminatory. They discriminate between men and women. They haven\u2019t gone to any men, accusing them of being fat and suspending them. Only women.</p> <p>\u201cMy appearance is my business, not theirs. It\u2019s my private matter and in fact, I\u2019m the way a common, natural Egyptian woman is. You can\u2019t judge a presenter only by how much they weigh.\u201d</p> <p>Khattab\u2019s programme, called Itelala (Views), is broadcast on public television\u2019s Channel Two every Friday at 9pm. It reflects on the social and cultural events of the past week, with guests usually invited to the studio. \u201cI have a long history of very successful programmes and my place will be empty if I leave my programme as the result of this,\u201d she said. </p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkItpTFRq18\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"345\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/tkItpTFRq18?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>According to the privately owned Egyptian newspaper al-Youm al-Sabe (the seventh day), the decision was taken by Ertu\u2019s female director Saffa Hijazi, who has called on the presenters to go on diets if they want to keep their job. <br></p> <p>Khattab said many people in Egypt had expressed sympathy with their situation. \u201cThe public opinion in Egypt reject this decision against many of our country\u2019s distinguished presenters,\u201d she said. Not everyone has been supportive, with some using derogatory terms such as \u201cbakabouzas\u201d (overweight girls in Arabic) to refer to them. <br></p> <p>Reda Eldanbouki, director of the women\u2019s centre for guidance and legal awareness, an Egyptian NGO based in al-Mansoura, said it was shameful for Hijazi to ask the eight presenters to only come back in front of camera once their appearance has become \u201cappropriate\u201d. <br></p> <p>\u201cThis decision was shameful and violates various clauses of the Egyptian constitution and objectifies women and is abusive towards them,\u201d he told the Guardian. \u201cIt also violates the ability for women to work freely in public positions. It contradicts the most important agreements that demands total equality between the genders in public positions and also the agreements to end all discrimination against women.\u201d</p> <p>Eldanbouki called on the public broadcaster to rescind the decision, reinstate the presenters and offer them an apology. He noted that it also violated many international treaties that Egypt has endorsed. \u201cThe Arab charter on human rights 2004 states that all people are equal before the law and every citizen has the right to equal opportunities to work in every public position available in their country based on principle of equal opportunities,\u201d Eldanbouki said.</p> <p>Khattab said the nationwide debate the decision has prompted has put a great deal of psychological pressure on her, distracting her from her usual life. She still has another programme on radio, which is about poetry, that she has been allowed to continue. </p> <p>But she is unsure about the fate of her TV programme. \u201cFor now, they have banned me from appearing in front of camera for one month,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t know what will happen after that, whether I will be prevented from doing my job or not.\u201d On Itelala, she said she talked about \u201cvery crucial subjects about social, cultural issues and also about the media, whether they exaggerate or they are telling the truth.\u201d</p> <p>Khattab said the TV authorities did not care about the real reason why the state broadcaster has been lagging behind its competitors. \u201cThey don\u2019t care about the TV itself and how it progresses and how it is placed compared to other TVs. The state TV cannot compete with other channels, it does not have the characteristics to do so.\u201d|<br></p> <p>Asked if losing her job would be a burden, she said: \u201cFinancially everybody wants to work, it\u2019s my job first of all, it\u2019s my right, and I\u2019m very successful in my field. I just want justice.\u201d</p> <p>Khattab\u2019s ordeal comes at a critical time for journalists in Egypt, a country that has dramatically stepped up its persecution of the press since president, Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, once head of the armed forces, took the helm in the aftermath of the 2013 military coup that ousted the democratically elected president, Mohamed Morsi.</p> <p>According to Reporters Without Borders, under Sisi\u2019s leadership \u201cthe current authorities are orchestrating a \u2018Sisification\u2019 of the media\u201d and \u201cjournalists are obliged on national security grounds to report only the official version of \u2018terrorist\u2019 attacks\u201d.</p> <p>Last year, Egypt was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/feb/23/egypt-prison-for-journalists-reporters-without-borders-letter\">one of the world\u2019s worst jailers of journalists</a>, with at least 24 behind bars. </p> <p>According to the New York-based Committee to Protect Journalists this year alone four journalists have been sentenced for \u201cpublishing false news\u201d, five other been sent to trial and two locked up. Photojournalist Mahmoud Abou Zeid has been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/greenslade/2014/jun/25/egypt-journalist-safety\">behind bars for more than 900 days</a>. </p>",
  "<p>Caitlyn Jenner\u2019s reality TV show I Am Cait hit the chopping block earlier this week. There will be no third season. Social statements about their programming aside, the bottom line for E! must have been that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/aug/16/caitlyn-jenner-i-am-cait-will-not-return-third-season\">hardly anybody was watching it</a>. After opening with 2.7 million viewers, it dipped as low as 480,000 before the network decided to pull the plug. </p> <p>As I am trans and very visible, I have countless one-on-one conversations about being transgender, often with strangers. Nobody has ever asked me my take on scenes from I Am Cait, but hundreds have asked: \u201cWhat do you think of Caitlyn Jenner?\u201d </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/aug/16/caitlyn-jenner-i-am-cait-will-not-return-third-season\">Caitlyn Jenner's I Am Cait will not return to TV for a third season</a> </p> </aside>  <p>I think we should thank her. Ms Jenner\u2019s vast media exposure has pressed a conversation about gender upon the American public, meaning that millions can no longer claim total ignorance of the issues that affect transgender people. This is a huge benefit for the trans rights cause, even if her story is not representative of most trans people\u2019s lived experience.</p> <p>The Jenner effect has given the world an exemplar of a trans individual \u2013 herself. Tabloid speculation, her Diane Sawyer interview, and most recently the reality show all cultivated a national curiosity in gender identity. Following her pinup-esque <a href=\"http://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2015/06/caitlyn-jenner-bruce-cover-annie-leibovitz\">Vanity Fair cover</a>, networks across the country reached out for local trans commentators. I found myself visiting <a href=\"http://www.msnbc.com/melissa-harris-perry/watch/the-politics-of-navigating-identity-464179267722\">Melissa Harris-Perry</a> and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knLujYS6btY\">Good Day New York</a> to discuss Jenner through my own story.</p> <p>It was an important opportunity to speak up while the world listened, but in doing so I discovered a new talent for speaking, writing and outreach that was marketable. I owe my own advocacy career in no small part to Jenner.</p> <p>A backlash accelerated too. Earlier this year, South Dakota governor Dennis Daugaard prepared to sign a law restricting bathroom use by assigned sex. He claimed he had never met a transgender person, and only backed down after that was <a href=\"http://www.argusleader.com/story/opinion/voices/2016/02/13/gov-daugaard-you-met-transgender-person-me/80330184/\">proven to be a lie</a>. Acting against trans people is getting harder to get away with now \u2013 at least without huge political cost.</p> <p>North Carolina surpassed South Dakota\u2019s attempt, passing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/may/09/lgbt-bathroom-bill-north-carolina-justice-department\">its discriminatory law</a> in a March special session. Companies, major artists and even sports tournaments are pulling their assets from the state, and the federal government has filed suit to challenge the law. Trans people suddenly matter \u2013 and not just the ones who look like Jenner.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"608fd42fdb842c80ea4656111cc00f61134f5f6b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/608fd42fdb842c80ea4656111cc00f61134f5f6b/0_142_3594_2157/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jenner accepts the award for outstanding reality program for I am Cait at the Glaad media awards in April.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Caitlyn Jenner accepts the award for outstanding reality program for I Am Cait at the Glaad media awards in April.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alberto E Rodriguez/Getty Images for Glaad</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Still, Jenner\u2019s affluence and privilege remain major reservations for the transgender community and our allies. Plenty outright despise her, noting that she can afford fancy clothing and feminizing surgery that are inaccessible to many of us. She will never face eviction, struggle to find jobs or resort to sex work.</p> <p>The notion we must firmly debunk is that fortune alone has made her transition easy. Rather than write her off over jealousy, there is a better way for any activist to guide this narrative: privilege does not shield anyone from possibly being trans. Being rich, in fact, can also lock you in.</p> <p>As a woman of 31 who transitioned between the ages of 25 and 29, I look at 66-year-old Jenner and wonder whether I could live my life thus far again and half beyond, unable to express my true self. How constricted did she feel, even trapped within a spacious \u201cwalk-in\u201d closet? She helps prove to the world that it is never too early, nor too late, nor too complicated to embrace your gender identity or reinvent yourself in any other way imaginable.</p> <p>Jenner is a self-made woman since her record-setting performance at the 1976 Montreal Olympic Games. Her detractors, LGBT and otherwise, would be willing to overlook wealth alone were it not for the crazy things she says. She <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/apr/28/bruce-jenner-transgender-republican\">identified herself as a Republican</a> to Diane Sawyer and said she \u201cdidn\u2019t quite get\u201d same-sex marriage, <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/caitlyn-jenner-clarifies-thoughts-on-same-sex-marriage--2015149\">though she later clarified her comments</a> on Ellen.</p> <p>Face-to-face with the Advocate\u2019s <a href=\"https://lifeafterdawn.com/\">Dawn Ennis</a>, herself the most experienced openly trans journalist in the industry, she envisioned becoming Ted Cruz\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.advocate.com/caitlyn-jenner/2016/3/02/she-cait-and-i-am-not-face-face-jenner\">trans ambassador</a>. Yes, that Ted Cruz, the fear-monger who accused a Planned Parenthood shooter of being a <a href=\"https://thinkprogress.org/ted-cruz-describes-alleged-planned-parenthood-shooter-as-transgendered-leftist-activist-f16525c4504a#.7pbrwdsfe\">transgender leftist activist</a>. If she wants to be his trans whisperer, I say let her try.</p> <p>One can take a more lenient stance on dingbat misguided statements coming from someone who genuinely desires to <a href=\"http://caitlynjenner.com/2015/09/what-ive-learned/\">do good</a> than from someone like Donald Trump who makes <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/09/trump-gun-owners-clinton-judges-second-amendment\">thinly veiled</a> cracks about assassinating rivals. The Republicans need voices like Jenner\u2019s because she is rich, white, and fits within conservatism in every other ideological way besides how she expresses herself.</p> <p>We all screw up at first on this journey. As one example, I adored the first out trans woman I ever met as an undergrad at Boston University. I was still a deeply closeted guy. My friends had come over for a random movie night. When she left for the bathroom, I revealed her status to the others, simply because I could not contain how cool I felt it was. I had zero concept of the rudeness or hurt that comes from outing someone. I learned over time, and Jenner will too.</p> <p>Perhaps the hardest part to learn \u2013 or relearn \u2013 once the adrenaline rush of transition takes over our spirits and fire is that trans is just one aspect of identity, and gender likewise the one thing it changes. I\u2019d love to see Jenner return to sportscasting, particularly for the Olympic decathlon. Trust the viewing public to rely upon her, or other trans individuals (like me?), to tell stories unrelated to gender transition, drawing instead upon our broader life experiences. Then watch the rightwing nuts try to lash out against such coverage, inevitably drawing in even more intrigue.</p> <p>Whatever she chooses, the cancellation of I Am Cait is just a small setback within an otherwise triumphant transition story \u2013 the first, if not only, transition story many have ever heard. I can respect why my peers might say good riddance, but part of me is devastated.</p> <p>I will never get to be on her show. There was that awkward moment at an awards dinner when I stood two feet behind her, hoping she\u2019d turn so I could muster the courage event to introduce myself, and maybe pitch myself to her. I melted and she never even fliched. Terrible plan.</p> <p>Caitlyn, you have a standing invitation to join me on my show one day. I have no show yet, nor any clue what form it would take, but I am dreaming just a little bigger now because of how you challenged us to be our bests. Brava!</p> <ul> <li>This article was amended on 19 August 2016 to clarify that Caitlyn Jenner came out in support of same-sex marriage after initially being unclear on her position. An earlier version stated that she opposed same-sex marriage.</li> </ul>",

  "<h2>Yet you may see the meaning of within</h2> <p>Now I\u2019m not saying it\u2019s a conspiracy or anything, but some people in the comments seem to know a bit too much about what\u2019s going to happen in Mr Robot. Sure, in the fractured mental universe Elliot inhabits there was a possibility that his low-key life of diner lunches and basketball might have turned out to be a illusion, but a lot of you guys just seemed to <em>know</em>. I\u2019m reporting you to Philip Price. Enjoy your moment of glory.</p> <p>Yes, it turned out to be all a dream. Actually, not a dream but a lie. Elliot is in prison for a crime as yet unspecified (is it the hack? Or Tyrell Wellick? Or something altogether different?). He says that he conjured up his apparently humdrum existence in order to protect us, his imaginary friend. He promises he won\u2019t lie to us again. And he\u2019s the hero, so we trust him, right?</p> <p>In terms of unreliable narration, Elliot upped the ante in this week\u2019s excellent episode. His bedroom turned out to be a cell, his therapy was being conducted in the prison visiting room. His new pal Leon was not only a fellow con but allied to the Dark Army, and capable of sticking five men dead in a bloody frenzy. As for Ray and his online business empire, that remains unclear. Perhaps for good reason. After all, it would seem that prison authorities might be less than keen for an inmate to get unfettered access to the darknet from the comfort of their own cell (potential theory: Ray is actually a prison guard or governor and therefore has access to places ordinary prisoners would not). Whatever the truth, I for one have had my opinion of Elliot shifted. In a drama, that\u2019s always a good thing.</p> <p>Maybe it was a necessary lie. The other thread to Elliot\u2019s story this week is his reconciliation with Mr Robot, his acceptance that this persona will not only always be with him but actually <em>is </em>him. It\u2019s Elliot who has violent compulsions and takes great risks. It is he who, as we are being (mis)led to understand, shot dead the murderer Wellick.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3e4e5cd5a229ad1dd9130441ac77bf8015ff3136\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3e4e5cd5a229ad1dd9130441ac77bf8015ff3136/0_134_1065_639/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Not only has Elliot reconciled with Mr Robot, but Mr Robot has actually started being nice.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Not only has Elliot reconciled with Mr Robot, but Mr Robot has actually started being nice.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Amazon</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>We will (un)learn more over the coming weeks, but I think it\u2019s fair to say that this little <em>coup de theatre</em> is not a Bobby Ewing moment. We\u2019ve learned that Elliot\u2019s actions this season took place in a different context, but they still happened. I think.</p> <h2>But listen to the colour of your dreams</h2> <p>Elliot\u2019s control as a narrator is not unlimited. He is not party to what is happening with Angela, for example. She begins this episode narrowly avoiding being sprung by my number one dream agent, Dominique DiPierro, and ends it isolated in Evil Corp\u2019s Risk Management department (motto: Keep Calm and Manage Risk). It\u2019s certainly an odd episode for her, the girl next door who transformed into a corporate killer. Dom knows she\u2019s behind f.soc\u2019s pwning of the FBI. And she\u2019s right. But Angela\u2019s new colleagues in Risk don\u2019t trust her either after some awfully transparent manoeuvring to get hold of the files on the New York facility scandal (honestly, one day as a hacker and she thinks she\u2019s Snowden). <br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3794b308c272aa0a85173f30d1239b89b6c32f29\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3794b308c272aa0a85173f30d1239b89b6c32f29/98_0_1042_625/1000.jpg\" alt=\"One day as a hacker and she thinks she\u2019s Snowden \u2026 Angela makes moves that would give Phillip Price a stroke.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">One day as a hacker and she thinks she\u2019s Snowden \u2026 Angela makes moves that would give Phillip Price a stroke.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Amazon</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Why all the sudden risky moves? It could be that she\u2019s been chastened by the encounter with her father who, in a move that would give Phillip Price a stroke, announced that he cared not for money at all and that any settlement he and his fellow class-actioners might agree to would be about truth and justice. That was what Angela wanted too, last season. But in taking Terry Colby\u2019s bargain, she\u2019s gone far in a direction where money is the only thing that talks. Perhaps her actions here were an attempt to rectify this. So far they don\u2019t seem to have borne much fruit.</p> <h2>Order v Chaos rating: 8</h2> <p>The social and political climate is at a steady simmer. Phillip Price is still waiting for his bailout as a pair of big brass balls crash the congress floor. Outside, the Evil Corp HQ protesters are getting ever louder. Lady Wellick gets covered in (perhaps bull) blood, not for being a murderer though, just a capitalist.</p> <p>Finally we hear an announcement over the radio that taxis will no longer be taking cash. Instead, riders are encouraged to use E Coins. I presume this to be the proprietary currency of Evil Corp. I\u2019m sure it was introduced to simplify daily transactions like paying electricity bills etc. But hey, what if the dollar was no longer a stable enough currency to trade in, thanks to, say, a massive hacking attack? Would that not make E Coins a very attractive alternative currency, one that was both stable and already being used by most households? What if that was what Evil Corp and WhiteRose wanted all along?</p> <h2>Self harm index: green</h2> <p>Not only has Elliot learned to accept he is Mr Robot, Mr Robot has started being nice to Elliot. Not only does he hold his hand in solitary, he literally takes a beating from a bunch of goons on Elliot\u2019s behalf (some brilliantly swift editing visually switching Mr Robot for Elliot every time a blow rained down). What an inspiring figure.</p> <h2>Questions</h2> <p>Where is Ray? What are E Coins? Did Phillip look a little vulnerable as he talked about E Corp \u201chaemorrhaging money\u201d? Leon turns out to be pretty scary, huh?</p>",
  "<p>Getting married is supposed to be one of the best days of your life \u2013 but what if it\u2019s not? This week, the 2015 Bake Off winner <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2015/oct/12/bake-off-winner-nadiya-hussain-muslims-britain\">Nadiya Hussain</a> described her wedding as one of the <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/nadiya-hussain-great-british-bake-off-gbbo-wedding-day-one-of-worst-of-her-life-a7192256.html\">worst days of her life</a>. \u201cYou are literally on show and it\u2019s something I was always really uncomfortable with,\u201d she said.</p> <p>A wedding day can become a disaster for other reasons too, from extreme nerves to the venue falling through. We asked for your stories of nuptial horrors. Here, six people tell of everything from a death to rowdy guests. </p> <h2>\u2018I hated my dress, my hair and the fact that my husband arrived late\u2019 \u2013 Annie, 65, East Midlands</h2> <p>My husband\u2019s family are Catholic and insisted that we wed in a very unattractive church in my hometown. I actually wanted to have a register office wedding followed by a few drinks in a pub, but I was out-voted. We had very little money and although my parents grudgingly coughed up for the reception we had to pay for everything else. My mother-in-law-to-be was constantly adding further expenses \u2013 flowers, organs, choirs. Being young and stupid we allowed this.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"51cc5563dbb8236519a230a68e42c7dc63b56173\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/51cc5563dbb8236519a230a68e42c7dc63b56173/0_170_5100_3060/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Church wedding\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018We wed in a very unattractive church in my hometown.

I hated the embarrassment of having to be the centre of attention and the fact that I dismally failed to live up to anyone\u2019s idea of a blushing bride, a sentiment echoed by two older women standing outside the church who asked me when the bride was arriving.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We spent our wedding night in a local hotel in a room with single beds</p> <footer> <cite>Annie</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>My husband was equally miserable and we both felt that the money could have been better used to fund a deposit on a house. We spent our wedding night in a local hotel in a room with single beds. I remember spending a lot of time in there sicking up the wedding breakfast through a combination of nerves, exhaustion and the large scotch my father pressed on me before we left for the church. It was such a disastrous day that we have never felt inclined to celebrate any wedding anniversary since, even though we have now been married for 45 years. </p> <h2>\u2018I had to grin and bear it but was livid\u2019 \u2013 Mark, London<br></h2> <p>It was my now-wife\u2019s dream to have our reception in an exquisite location, with a private garden for kids to play in. So we booked a venue in London and it rained heavily during the church ceremony, but the sun came out during the reception. However, the manager of the venue decided to lock all the doors and would not allow any of the guests access to the garden. I tried to appeal to her, but she would not come out of her office to speak to me. I got very frustrated and angry \u2013 not what you want during your wedding reception. Eventually she came down and said it was for health and safety reasons, so guests would not slip and get their clothes dirty. </p> <p>My wife and I were very upset \u2013 one of the main reasons for having our reception there was the garden, and no one told us they could lock all the doors if they chose. </p> <p>I would have made a scene if all our friends and family had not been there, but I had to grin and bear it. I am still angry about how it ruined our wedding reception. We console ourselves saying that the rest of the day was great.</p> <h2>\u2018I had to go and lie down during the dinner, and couldn\u2019t eat a thing\u2019 \u2013 Amy, 35, Wiltshire</h2> <p>I used to be an events manager. I have never had so much go wrong with planning before: the dress arrived late, the shoes I ordered had to be returned, the marquee company mis-measured the tables so I had to change the table plan last-minute. The list of problems was neverending. </p> <p>The day itself was beautiful, but we were both shattered and struggled with being the centre of attention. Both of us are quite shy. Neither of us had slept properly for weeks. I felt on edge for the rest of the day, worrying about everyone else. I wish someone had asked me if I was all right \u2013 all I needed was some reassurance that everyone else was enjoying themselves.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The day itself was beautiful, but we were both shattered and struggled with being the centre of attention</p> <footer> <cite>Amy</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>I had to go and lie down during the dinner, and couldn\u2019t eat anything.

I\u2019d become so freaked out, I was having anxiety dreams: walking down the aisle to find my husband-to-be waiting for me without a head, giant rats in my underground cave ceremony, that sort of thing. This was compounded by not being able to eat for the final month because of nerves.</p> <p>On the day itself, it pissed it down, the hotel \u201clost\u201d loads of the booze we\u2019d supplied for the evening bit, and the DJ was really grumpy. By the time I went to bed that evening, I was crying because my new husband had gone to the bar with his friends as he wasn\u2019t \u201cready for bed\u201d. My tears continued the next morning when I said goodbye to all my friends and family sobbing. After it was all over, I felt horrified that I had been sucked into such an embarrassing, narcissistic load of nonsense. </p> <h2>\u2018A relative died on my wedding day\u2019 \u2013 Chloe, 57</h2> <p>My husband and I were 23 when we got married. We had the wedding in my hometown in Wales and invited all our friends and then our parents invited all the family. Among them was an elderly uncle of my husband who had been poorly but came. He was in the church for the wedding and during the line to meet and greet, complained of feeling tired so his daughter took him to sit on a park bench where he promptly died as he sat there. Luckily she had the presence of mind to put his hat on his head and just hold his hand while the crowd went by. We didn\u2019t really know anything about it as half the family were doctors who knew what to do. All the family were brilliant and kept saying how he would have wanted to go like that, after having been to church and surrounded by the family.</p> <h2>\u2018I was totally pissed before the nuptials had even begun\u2019 \u2013 Tanya, 37, Ireland</h2> <p>Where do I start? My mother tried to convince me not to get married in the middle of winter, but I said no \u2013 how bad does winter really ever get in Ireland? The answer: historically bad. Christmas 2010 has become synonymous with cancelled flights, frozen pipes and no drinking water. Amazingly, all of our guests made it to the day, though evening guests cut their losses and stayed at home. <br></p> <p>The morning of the wedding, my hairdresser arrived early. \u201cThem roads are shocking, you better ring and warn your guests before someone\u2019s killed on that ice,\u201d was her opening greeting. That didn\u2019t help my nerves and so I started on the bubbly, while texting every single friend with road safety measures. I cried a bit. I drank some more. The photographers arrived and remarked that they thought the groom would be there by now but couldn\u2019t find him. I became convinced he\u2019d been killed. More tears ensued, and I downed a third glass. The bridesmaid was dispatched to locate the future husband and on coming back with good tidings I guzzled more to celebrate. Result? Totally drunk before the nuptials had even begun.</p> <p>Now, one would imagine that that was sufficient trauma for one day. But alas, we had chosen a multipurpose venue for our special day. In the function room next to ours was wedding number two, a rowdy and animated bunch. That would have been fine, if the rooms hadn\u2019t been separated by a partition and we weren\u2019t sharing the same bathroom facilities. These guests were stashing their Smirnoff behind the cisterns in the loo, and any attempt to use the toilet by our guests was deemed as an intrusion. <br></p> <p>The redeeming parts of the day were the service itself, which, despite my being rather drunk was very moving and special. I did keep looking at my husband and thinking, \u201cI am so thrilled and lucky to be marrying you.\u201d</p> <ul> <li><em>Some names have been changed</em><br></li> </ul>",

  "<p>Uber passengers in Pittsburgh will be able to hail self-driving cars for the first time within the next few weeks as the taxi firm tests its future vision of transportation in the city.</p> <p>The company said on Thursday that an unspecified number of autonomous Ford Fusions will be available to pick up passengers as with normal Uber vehicles. The cars won\u2019t exactly be driverless \u2013 they will have human drivers as backup \u2013 but they are the next step towards a fully automated fleet. </p> <p>Passengers will be able to opt in if they want a self-driving car, and rides will be free to those willing to do it, a spokesman said.<br></p> <p>Uber, which has a self-driving research lab in Pittsburgh and has been testing the cars around the city in recent months, has no immediate plans to deploy self-driving cars beyond the Pittsburgh experiment. </p> <p>It\u2019s CEO, Travis Kalanick, has said the ride-sharing company\u2019s future and indeed the future of all transportation is driverless.</p> <p>\u201cWhen there\u2019s no other dude in the car, the cost of taking an Uber anywhere becomes cheaper than owning a vehicle. You basically bring the cost below the cost of ownership for everybody, and then car ownership goes away,\u201d Kalanick said at the Code Conference in 2014, shortly after Google unveiled its self-driving car prototype.</p> <p>The Silicon Valley company also announced on Thursday that it is working together with Swedish carmaker Volvo on self-driving cars, signing a $300m (\u00a3230m) deal.<br></p> <p>The agreement will allow the two firms to pool resources, and initially expand the autonomous capabilities of Volvo\u2019s XC90 SUV, which is already one of the most advanced road cars available with various autonomous safety systems is and due to begin <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/apr/27/volvo-test-self-driving-cars-london-2017\">self-driving trials in London in 2017</a>.</p> <p>Vehicle manufacturers across the world are racing to produce systems capable of driving themselves in among regular traffic.

Volvo\u2019s chief executive, H\u00e5kan Samuelsson, is certain that high-end car buyers <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/may/03/self-driving-cars-volvo-chief-autopilot\">will flock to buy self-driving cars</a>, while Uber\u2019s vast on-demand car fleet could potentially bring the technology to ordinary people more quickly. </p> <p>Toyota has said it is investing an undisclosed sum in Uber, while German rival Volkswagen has said it will back Gett, a ride-hailing company.

Volvo will operate the same vehicles, developing a system designed to be owned and used by a driver, partly under the guise of safety. This reflects the company\u2019s ambitious plan to ensure no one is either seriously injured or killed in one of its cars from 2020, which it says is only possible by integrating automated technology.</p> <p>\u201cAutonomous driving is key. For this you need software to develop and be safe,\u201d Volvo\u2019s chief executive, Hakan Samuelsson, told Reuters.</p> <p>Bought by Geely from Ford in 2010, Volvo has long been a pioneer in car safety having invented the three-point seat belt and making it standard equipment in 1959.</p> <p>\u201cVolvo is a leader in vehicle development and best-in-class when it comes to safety,\u201d said Travis Kalanick, Uber\u2019s chief executive.</p> <p>The joint interment will provide funds for sensor and hardware research, as well as the software required to spot obstacles and drive the car.

Early on Thursday evening, the speaker, Ana Pastor, announced that the debate would be held on 30 August.</p> <p>The deal is unlikely to result in the swift establishment of a government as, even with the support of Ciudadanos, the People\u2019s party will be unable to muster enough votes to win a majority in Spain\u2019s 350-seat congress of deputies.</p> <p>But Rajoy could still manage to form a minority government if the socialist PSOE party agreed to abstain in a second vote, which is held 48 hours after the first, and which requires only a simple majority. However, the PSOE leader, Pedro S\u00e1nchez, has repeatedly ruled out doing anything that would facilitate Rajoy\u2019s return to power.</p> <p>Speaking after the meeting, Rivera said Rajoy had met the conditions needed to win Ciudadanos\u2019s backing.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve asked two things of Mr Rajoy: first, that he sign the anti-corruption pact \u2013 and he\u2019s agreed to,\u201d said Rivera. \u201cThe second thing I asked was that a date for investiture be set today \u2013 and Mr Rajoy has promised to fix one this afternoon.\u201d</p> <p>Rajoy said that a \u201cdecisive step\u201d had been taken, adding that teams from his party and Rivera\u2019s would begin negotiations on Friday.</p> <p>Despite <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/29/spain-mariano-rajoy-accepts-king-felipe-invitation-form-government\">accepting the King\u2019s invitation to try to form a government three weeks ago, Rajoy had been cagey</a> as to whether he would submit himself to a vote that he is almost certain to lose.</p> <p>His decision to accept the Ciudadanos plan and put himself forward for investiture will increase pressure on S\u00e1nchez, who risks being seen as a stumbling block to the formation of a government.</p> <p>Rajoy called on the socialist leader to drop his opposition and \u201cco-operate so that we can have a government\u201d. The alternative, he said, would be \u201can unmitigated disaster\u201d for which S\u00e1nchez would bear responsibility.</p> <p>Earlier on Thursday, Pablo Iglesias, leader of the far-left Unidos Podemos party \u2013 which finished third in both recent elections \u2013 said he had been talking to S\u00e1nchez about the prospect of forming a progressive government if Rajoy failed in his investiture bid. </p> <p>The socialists, however, were quick to distance themselves from Iglesias\u2019s claim. In a statement, the party said that while S\u00e1nchez had kept talking to his fellow party leaders, \u201che has not broached the subject of putting together an alternative government in the hypothetical event of Mr Rajoy\u2019s failure with any other political grouping\u201d.</p>",

Over the past five years there has been a 49% increase in ethnic-minority long-term youth unemployment, compared with a 2% fall in white youth unemployment. The report also found that black and Asian workers are more than twice as likely to be in the insecure work that is blighting Britain.</p> <p>Nothing about these findings should be surprising: black young people have historically suffered from disproportionately high levels of unemployment and limited opportunities. However, it is no coincidence that inequalities have worsened since 2010, when the coalition government began dismantling social provision.

Perhaps the bigger issue has been the loss of decently paid, secure public sector work that offered ethnic minorities decent employment.</p> <p>When left to its own devices the free market has shown again and again that it will racially discriminate. This is why the Race Relations Act was passed in 1965, and ethnic minorities have <a href=\"http://www.runnymedetrust.org/uploads/Parliamentary%20briefings/CutsdebateMarch2011.pdf\">largely relied on public sector employment</a> for career advancement.

Flagged up here are many of the burning issues that BAME communities face: endemic discrimination in stop and search, massive disproportionality in prosecution and sentencing. Disappointing, though, given the racialisation of the \u201cgangs\u201d issue, by police, CPS and media alike, is the failure to mention the joint enterprise laws. This doctrine has operated over the years as a mechanism to create guilt by association, hoovering up and criminalising young poor men and children with alarming regularity. Nevertheless, the report is timely. It disrupts the self-congratulatory narrative, established soon after the Macpherson report, that Britain has entered a post-racial era. If there is racism, it\u2019s an individual failing \u2013 not the problem of the system.</p> <p>If the report\u2019s findings are backed up by the Lammy independent review into the treatment of, and outcomes for, BAME individuals in the criminal justice system, then this could strengthen the call from community organisations for much needed radical reform. But if this is to happen, we have to get beyond an approach that sidetracks the debate into one of recruitment and retention of more BAME police officers, prosecutors, judges.

The Guardian sought comment on the pipeline and the restraining order from Energy Transfer partners, but they did not respond before deadline. </p> <p>People at the rallies uniformly reported that 400 to 500 people had gathered at the blockade site over the last two days, with 700 people camping in solidarity. Mossett says that food and other supplies are being brought to the camps, and facilities set up because \u201cwe anticipate that it\u2019s going to grow\u201d.<br></p> <p>Morton County sheriff Tom KirchMeier said it\u2019s difficult to tell exactly how many people have assembled. \u201cThe current numbers are unknown. We are assessing regularly as the numbers change hourly, and daily,\u201d he said. North Dakota Highway Patrol spokesman Tom Iverson said extra traffic control had been dispatched to the area to cope with the large number of vehicles arriving at the site.</p> <p>According to Mossett, the immediate goal for activists is to prevent construction until 24 August, when an <a href=\"http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2016/08/15/dakota-access-pipeline-standoff-mni-wiconi-water-life-165470\">application for an injunction</a> by the Standing Rock Sioux will be heard in Washington DC. </p> <p>If Dakota Access will not suspend construction until then, the protesters are determined to force them to do so, at least at this point in the pipeline. This weekend, protesters are planning to take to the river in canoes and other watercraft. </p> <p>In the longer term, Hall says they will be there \u201cas long as it takes\u201d.</p> <p>In recent years, there have been a string of indigenous actions against oil pipelines in the US and Canada, but this one is already attracting especially broad support. On <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/jon.eagle.sr/posts/1263456217011924\">Facebook</a>, Jon Eagle Sr, the Tribal Historic Preservation Officer at the Standing Rock Reservation, affirmed that the Seven Council Fires of the Sioux Nation \u2013 representing all Sioux groups \u2013 had come together for the first time since 1876 over this issue. Tribal chairman Archambault called in a <a href=\"http://standingrock.org/data/upfiles/media/Dave%E2%80%99s%20Press%20statement%20for%20release.pdf\">statement</a> for \u201cmy fellow American citizens (to) stand with my people\u201d.</p> <p>Mossett thinks that Native American pipeline activism may be at a crossroads. \u201cThis is the first time that the tribes have been coming together in recent history.\u201d</p> <p> </p>",
  "<p>The vicarage garden has long been neglected, home to an impenetrable thicket of bindweed, bramble and disgusting plastic rubbish smuggled in by those shrieking foxes. This year the resistance began. Not knowing the first thing about gardens, and driven by little more than shame at the state it\u2019s got into, I set about one small corner, hacking my way through ferocious weeds and thorns, them viciously biting back. A few months into this war of the roses and my defiantly urban soul has been strangely touched by the gentle magic of gardening. I am now watering, tending, watching; childishly excited about how my tomatoes are getting on. The other day I even built my&#xa0;own compost heap.</p> <p>For as long as I can remember, I have thought of the garden as little more than a flat parcel of land outside the back door, where the dog has a wee; no more interesting than the venue for an occasional BBQ and football kickabout. Certainly of no particular intellectual or moral interest. Which was pretty stupid of me \u2013 especially given that the Bible gives a whopping big clue that moral knowledge is first discovered among the apple trees of that first legendary garden, expulsion from which marked the beginning of the great salvation drama of Judao-Christianity.</p> <p>The garden, of course, is where human art and the anarchy of nature meet and battle it out. The traditionally French approach \u2013 famously exemplified at Versailles \u2013 has been for nature to appear subservient to human will, forcing even trees and shrubs to express their fealty to the Bourbon monarchy by lining up straight and standing to attention in clipped symmetrical rows. By contrast, the traditional English garden flatters nature with the illusion of its victory \u2013 though it is no less the product of artifice and design than the French garden. But whatever one\u2019s aesthetic (or is it political?) point of view, the garden remains a thrilling meeting point of humanity and the natural world. From behind a wheelbarrow, you are a part of something bigger than yourself. In silent reverie, you cooperate with forces that are not yours to control, nursing life and beauty and nourishment into existence. No wonder monks have always loved a garden. My younger self would have scoffed at these evening rounds of deadheading as a bourgeois retreat into some selfish domestic idyll. But as a place&#xa0;of healing for the mind and repair for the soul, I have found nowhere better. And&#xa0;a&#xa0;recent study by the <a href=\"http://www.kingsfund.org.uk/sites/files/kf/field/field_publication_file/Gardens_and_health.pdf\" title=\"\">King\u2019s Fund, Gardens and Health</a>: implications for policy and practice, gave an evidence-based version of that same answer.</p> <p>Of course, some gardens do&#xa0;reek of private privilege. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2016/feb/14/garden-bridge-half-truths-deceptions-evasions-thames-london-rowan-moore\" title=\"\">ill-fated garden bridge</a> across the Thames is deeply unpopular with so many south Londoners precisely because it takes \u00a360m of taxpayers\u2019 money and creates a flashy entertainment space that can be closed off and hired out as an expensive corporate playground. As more and more of the capital\u2019s public space is being privatised, the garden bridge is a line that should&#xa0;not be crossed.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"b7ae9d8415e48a2086303dd931dd19e573a96644\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b7ae9d8415e48a2086303dd931dd19e573a96644/0_171_3264_1958/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Guerrilla gardening at Elephant and Castle\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Guerrilla gardening at Elephant and Castle.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Giles Fraser</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But not all gardening is premised on some walled-off defence of private property. At the edge of my parish, the <a href=\"http://guerrillagardening.org/\" title=\"\">guerrilla gardener Richard Reynolds</a> has magically transformed the solid impacted soil beside unloved municipal byways into glorious little oases of lavender and sunflowers. In an echo of the great <a href=\"http://www.diggers.org/diggers/gerard_winstanley.htm\" title=\"\">Gerard Winstanley</a>, Reynolds doesn\u2019t seek permission from authority \u2013 in his case the hostile bureaucracy of Southwark council \u2013 he just gets out there with his trowel and plants the roundabouts in an act of resistance to the brutal inhumanity of the concrete jungle.</p> <p>My efforts have not been so daring or public-spirited. I sit back and look at cleared soil and imagine a future of hollyhocks and foxgloves. The Greeks called it eudaimonia, that sweetspot of intersection between happiness and virtue. We call it the good life. Children from the parish\u2019s music summer school surge into the vicarage garden for a lunchtime picnic. From here, I can hear the cries of cricket fans at the Oval. And, on a still night, the sound of Big Ben. Sometime in the future the bindweed will have the place back. Eventually, the weeds will inherit the earth. But for now, I have cleared some space to live in. Think in. And I am grateful.</p> <p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/giles_fraser\" title=\"\">@giles_fraser</a></p>",

Over the first seven episodes of the show\u2019s second season (the eighth airs on Sunday 21 August), the cast travels from Los Angeles to Baja aboard the Abigail, a yacht belonging to enigmatic businessman Victor Strand, played by Colman Domingo. </p> <p>Hence the infinity tanks, which today are empty \u2013 the main exterior Abigail set has just been removed from the studio\u2019s prize outdoor tank, which resembles an enormous series of interlocking concrete salt dishes. It\u2019s a massive undertaking: the original task of moving the boat from the soundstage where it was constructed to the tank was scheduled for half a day, but took over two days. Still, even the empty tank is impressive, and looks more like a skate park than a film set. (It comfortably held the entire vessel used for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/News_Story/Critic_Review/Guardian_review/0,4267,1089474,00.html\">Master and Commander: the Far Side of the World</a>).</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0aef582fb351bc5d5a8506ca837d437d0669920e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0aef582fb351bc5d5a8506ca837d437d0669920e/2341_243_8388_5035/1000.jpg\" alt=\"There will be blood: Frank Dillane as Nick Clark, Alycia Debnam-Carey as Alicia Clark and Michelle Ang as Alex.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">There will be blood: Frank Dillane as Nick Clark, Alycia Debnam-Carey as Alicia Clark and Michelle Ang as Alex.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Richard Foreman Jr/AMC/AMC</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The tank is wide open, but the rare moments of filming I see during my day on set are crammed into tight spaces in what comes to feel like a maze encompassing the indoor sound stages. Each scene is set up in a space so narrow that it would be almost impossible not to get the angle the directors want, so they only run through a quick take or two before sending the relevant cast members off to another segment of the maze. The haste makes sense: each episode is filmed in eight days (some seven) on a tight turnaround.</p> <p>Not that the cast members are upset. \u201cPeople see what they want to see,\u201d Colman Domingo says, stretched out on a couch in his dressing room in one of the studio\u2019s main buildings, surrounded by a gaggle of journalists. He\u2019s describing the ambiguity of his character, Victor Strand, who provides some respite from the constant trauma of life in a zombie apocalypse and who is by far the best part of Fear the Walking Dead.</p> <p>\u201cWhat I love about our show is that you\u2019re ahead of the game,\u201d Domingo adds, referring to the fact that the Walking Dead audience knows far more than the characters. Alycia Debnam-Carey, who plays angsty teen Alicia Clark, knows all about the passion of the show\u2019s fans. \u201cYou\u2019re playing a teenager who is making mistakes in a world where the audience is so much more aware than our characters,\u201d she says, which is something she describes as \u201cfrustrating for our audience\u201d.

Speaking in a room covered in 3D models and SketchUp renders that look like unused concepts for Doobie Brothers album covers, production designer Bernardo Trujillo tells us that he and his team did the entire design and building of the Abigail sets in six weeks, from elaborate renderings depicting the full interior of the yacht to the various pieces that combine to create almost all of the locations and cabins. (\u201cWe learned a lot about boats,\u201d he says, laughing.) Erickson admits the intensity of this demand: \u201cIt\u2019s very easy to be in the writer\u2019s room and say hey, they\u2019re gonna get on a boat for a season. It\u2019s another thing when you have to build your section of the boat in six weeks.\u201d</p> <p>There\u2019s an extraordinary amount of stuff needed to keep the Fear machine going. Case in point: the props department, housed in a warehouse filled with fake weapons, backpacks and cans of food, in addition to making molds, filling them, and generating a large silo of prop weapons (including several differently-sized duplicates used to film slightly different, stitched-together versions of fight scenes), has to get clearance for the use of certain items. This legal limitation contributes to the oddity of many of the weapons used on the series \u2013 as props master Colin Thurston wryly notes, handing one of the assembled reporters a rubber machine gun for further examination, \u201cAMC are very protective about marks and branding\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/aug/15/best-tv-fear-the-walking-dead-60-days-in-fearless\">The week\u2019s best TV: Fear the Walking Dead, 60 Days In and Fearless</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The Walking Dead is, perhaps, the most valuable of those marks \u2013 especially considering the intensity of its fanbase. Over the course of our set visit, each actor on the show our group talks with is asked about the rabidity of fan reactions. \u201cOut of every hundred people,\u201d says Mercedes Mason, who plays Ofelia Salazar, there are \u201cthree or four who are mad at everything\u201d.

The studio is the site of a hyper-efficient production assembly line, churning out the same scenes with different variations to meet a large demand for Walking Dead content. It\u2019s kind of like a lunch buffet, just waiting to be crammed down so everyone can get back to work. But despite this high level of activity, the set is still somewhat subdued, more efficient than lively \u2013 for the production of a zombie show, Fear the Walking Dead is surprisingly bloodless.</p>",
  "<p>Rossy de Palma\u2019s left eye is a gentle sea-green, the lid softly hooded; her right eye is brighter and rounder, a sparkling hazel. As the sulky, menacing Marian in the new <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/pedroalmodovar\">Pedro Almod\u00f3var</a> film, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/may/17/julieta-review-pedro-almodovar-ties-himself-down-with-fractured-melodrama\">Julieta</a>, the left eye seems to dominate, casting a melancholy spell. But today, as herself \u2013 a vivacious arthouse icon \u2013 the right takes over. She is positively radiant.</p> <p>The skew of her features is softer in person than it looks on screen, her long nose more Modigliani-elegant than Picasso-strange. Still, her looks are such that it would be impossible for her to walk into a room without being noticed. In fact, as I am waiting in the green room of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/bfi\">British Film Institute</a> on a quiet weekday afternoon, her imminent arrival is announced by a smattering of film students in the foyer, who break into polite applause as she walks past. She is statuesque in high-heeled sandals, with crimson toenails matching the painterly daubs on the silk shirt she wears open over a tight dress. The large, gold earrings (she is, after all, a glamorous <em>Madrile\u00f1o</em> of a certain age) gleam under a leather pork-pie hat of the kind worn by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/the-specials\">the Specials</a>.</p> <p>Julieta marks De Palma\u2019s first major role in an Almod\u00f3var film in 21 years. The director cast her for the first time in <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BGdCdm_NXCy/\">Law of Desire</a>, in 1987, and then in four more films in the following eight years. For the past two decades, she has not worked with Almod\u00f3var, save for a cameo role in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2009/aug/27/broken-embraces-review\">Broken Embraces</a>. But the impression she left in those early films \u2013 huge earrings, bright clothes, jet-black hair \u2013 is so vivid that her on-screen appearance in Julieta as Marian, a scowling housekeeper in muddy-toned cardigans and a greying, frizzy perm, is quite a shock. \u201cIt\u2019s true! No glamour, baby! No glamour!\u201d She throws her head back; throaty laugh, huge white teeth. \u201cOoh la la!\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e7cfa73c434b9e199ec3bdf4d3d7683249208152\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e7cfa73c434b9e199ec3bdf4d3d7683249208152/0_0_5317_3840/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Adriana Ugarte and Rossy de Palma\" width=\"1000\" height=\"722\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">De Palma starring opposite Adriana Ugarte in Julieta.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: 20th Century Fox</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The story centres on a woman who has been missing for many years, and scenes set in the mid-80s revive the mischievous glamour of Almod\u00f3var\u2019s early heroines, so it is hard not to see the story mirrored in the real-life return of De Palma to centre stage. But she waves away the suggestion that she was an Almod\u00f3var exile. \u201cI felt like I was always connected to him. Even when I was not in his films, I felt like I am part of his world.\u201d On the set of Julieta, she was Almod\u00f3var\u2019s conspirator in playing jokes on the other actors, most of whom he was working with for the first time.</p> <p>\u201cWe make a lot of jokes when we are filming. Pedro will tell me silly things to say to the other actors, and they don\u2019t know that he is joking, because they don\u2019t know his sense of humour yet. When Pedro is shooting, he is very fun. He is so happy, because he is doing what he loves the most.\u201d</p> <p>The door opens, and Almod\u00f3var himself walks in to greet his muse. It is Almod\u00f3var season at the BFI, and tonight De Palma will introduce a screening of 1995\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBzIoP9EgEU\">The Flower of My Secret</a>, in which she plays a surburban housewife. Almod\u00f3var is neat and compact in trainers, a zipped-up leather jacket, hands stuffed into his jeans pockets. Even with his crown of badgerish white hair, De Palma, in her heels and hat, towers over him as they chat. After a few moments, they embrace for a second time, say their farewells and De Palma rejoins me on the sofa.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"8ade51b34cb5a971f694a488318edbc280e3e117\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8ade51b34cb5a971f694a488318edbc280e3e117/0_0_2319_3504/662.jpg\" alt=\"Rossy de Palma and Pedro Almod\u00f3var\" width=\"662\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018I felt like I was always connected to him, even when I was not in his films\u2019 \u2013 De Palma with Pedro Almod\u00f3var.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dan Wooller/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Julieta is a film in which \u201ceverything is held back \u2013 the pain, the love, the tears\u201d, she says. She could not be more different: she sits close, smiles and nods at my questions before cutting them short with a friendly pat on the thigh and taking over, her hands acting out an accompanying mime to every sentence. When she describes emotions being held back, for instance, her hands are around her throat. Sometimes the mime is quite tricky to decipher. She tells me about the character of Marian, who is \u201clike a Russian doll\u201d: \u201cWhen we meet her, she is young, but she already has an old woman inside. Time is like ...\u201d \u2013 she stops talking, moves her lips rapidly, pretends to pull something out of her mouth and stretch it \u2013 \u201cyes! Chewing gum. Time is like chewing gum.\u201d</p> <p>Almod\u00f3var tells women\u2019s stories in a way almost no one else does. They are messy and complicated and fearsome, rather than decorative, linear and neatly tied up with a kiss. Julieta addresses the thorny issue of ageing, with a main character played by two different actors, one portraying her youth, the other her middle age; the transition hinges on a scene where one morphs into the other while drying her hair under a towel. \u201cPedro says that makeup cannot change the look in the eye, and the look in the eye is what counts. So he wanted two women, a young woman and a mature woman. I prefer the look of the older woman, because you can see so much in her eyes, all that she has been through.\u201d</p> <p>De Palma will be 52 next month. \u201cBut I feel 25 inside. And who cares, anyway? I am healthy, so I have gratitude for that, because that is the most important thing. And if you have curiosity, if you can still be amazed by human beings and amazed by a beautiful flower, if you are still thinking about films you want to see and poems you want to write, then what difference does it make?\u201d<br></p> <p>As a teenager in Mallorca \u2013 born Rosa Elena Garcia Echave, she adopted her hometown as a stage name \u2013 she and eight friends formed a punk-pop band, called Peor Impossible. \u201cIt means \u2018the worst possible\u2019.

Once you are there, you are from there.\u201d</p> <p>Having never planned her career, she laughs at the idea that she might have a strategy for what to do next. \u201cI have always felt like an outsider, but I am very happy like that,\u201d she says. Does she ever long for, say, a huge box-office superhero movie? \u201cI would love to be in an action movie! Yes, yes, I could do all the kung fu! Ha ha!\u201d (She illustrates this point with a few kung fu moves. She looks marvellous.)</p> <p>Time is up and she stands to hug me. She smells incredible, so I tell her. \u201cBut it is my fragrance!\u201d she exclaims, before rummaging in her bag to show me a chic glass bottle: Rossy de Palma\u2019s Eau de Protection. \u201cI made a fragrance for protection, because too many perfumes are just seduction. Seduction is great, but there is so much more to being a woman.\u201d</p> <p><em>Julieta is released in the UK on 26 August</em></p>",
  "<p>The first of many women we see projected on to a large stage screen tonight is Naomi Campbell, clad in knee-high leather boots, fearsome headgear and little else.

You\u2019d only be half surprised if it ended with <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://anohni.com/\">Anohni</a> breaking out of a box and telling us she\u2019s <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQKjMvG7BLU\">not going to be the person she\u2019s expected to be any more</a>. </p> <p>Quite how this pensive intro relates to the former Antony and the Johnsons musician\u2019s Mercury-prize nominated eco-conscious electro album Hopelessness isn\u2019t obvious. Even less so why Campbell \u2013 supermodel of <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/jan/16/usa\">chucking-mobile-phone-at-a-maid infamy</a> \u2013 has been selected as effectively Anohni\u2019s earth mother spiritual avatar (she will appear onscreen again at the end of the show, miming the words to <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Pei4SnavUk\">Drone Bomb Me</a> with tearful eyes). But, as a device for announcing this show\u2019s clever multimedia credentials, not to mention its superior breeding to your average pop performance, it\u2019s effective. Drawing on Chichester-born, New York-made Anohni\u2019s background in performance art, this is a suitably striking audiovisual live treatment of what is <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/may/05/anohni-hopelessness-review-the-most-profound-protest-record-in-decades\">comfortably one of the year\u2019s best records</a>.</p> <p>Anohni finally appears to sing <a href=\"https://youtu.be/Fi0q0O4V5Qs\">4 Degrees</a>, her synth-powered banger about rising global temperatures. Dressed like a Jedi, her face shrouded by a veil, she cuts a mysterious, almost forlorn figure, disembodied even from her own gymnastically supple and fragile voice. She\u2019s flanked by American experimental musician Daniel Lopatin AKA <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://pointnever.com/\">Oneohtrix Point Never</a> and Scottish beatsmith and sometime Kanye West go-to guy Ross Birchard AKA <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.hudsonmohawke.com/\">Hudson Mohawke</a>. The pair resemble DJ friars in headphones and robes, prodding at laptops as they reconstruct Hopelessness\u2019s crisp, clean, imposing electronic architecture.</p> <p>The at-times transcendent quality of the music is at jarring odds with the grisliness of Anohni\u2019s words, which range across subjects from the dying natural world to political hypocrisy and sexual violence with unflinching brutality. On Watch Me she coos a sarcastic come-on to CIA snoops watching her watching pornography. On Obama she grimly denounces the outgoing president who swept to power on a tide of the very thing that her album desperately decries a subsequent loss of: hope. Set to a stuttering trap beat, Indian Girls \u2013 one of a handful of non-Hopelessness tracks performed tonight \u2013 includes such stomach-turning imagery as \u201cyou cut the throat of Indian girls / drove a stick from anus to mouth\u201d.</p> <p>Save for a terse thanks to collaborators and crew after the credits roll, Anohni doesn\u2019t speak a word, lest the spell somehow be broken. It would all feel like the work of someone who takes herself far too seriously were it not all done with such fine theatrical poise. If the catastrophic future which Anohni starkly prophesies comes to pass, we\u2019ll wonder why we didn\u2019t take her words more seriously still.</p>",

  "<p>I seem to have got myself into a bit of a pickle this week over comments I made at the <a href=\"https://www.edbookfest.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Edinburgh international book festival</a> on Sunday. The Times took my answer to a question about Brexit and <a href=\"http://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/corbyn-is-stuck-in-the-last-century-says-bragg-trhv6tqvj\" title=\"\">made it sound</a> like an attack on Jeremy Corbyn, laying my general criticisms of the Labour party squarely at his feet. I was portrayed as a \u201cpreviously loyal supporter\u201d of Corbyn who now felt that he was a 20th-century Labour man, unable to reach the parts of the electorate needed to build an effective political force.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/aug/15/neil-kinnock-condemns-corbyn-for-silence-or-ignorance-over-brexit\">Neil Kinnock condemns Corbyn for 'silence or ignorance' over Brexit</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Needless to say, I spent much of the day fire-fighting on social media, explaining that no, I had not given an interview to the Murdoch press and yes, I am still a supporter of Corbyn. Unfortunately my message failed to reach the editorial departments of the Mail, Express and Metro, who went ahead and ran the story without my corrections. After 12 hours of trying to contain the fuss, I decided to switch off my phone and watch the cycling in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/ng-interactive/2016/aug/05/rio-olympics-2016-medal-table-and-results-in-full\" title=\"\">Rio</a>.</p> <p>The festival event had been a lot of fun. I talked about my lyrics, played a few songs and took questions from the chair and audience, expressing my opinion that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jun/25/brexit-vote-poor-elite\" title=\"\">Brexit</a> is just the latest in a series of unexpected electoral results that have happened since the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/dec/28/markets-credit-crunch-banking-2008\" title=\"\">2008 financial crash</a>. The British people appear to have lost faith in the ability of Westminster to solve their problems. The first sign of this shift was the failure of the electorate to give any single party a mandate <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/general-election-2010\" title=\"\">in 2010</a>.</p> <p>Although the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/dec/15/-sp-britain-on-brink-real-story-scottish-independence\" title=\"\">Scottish referendum of 2014</a> was won by the unionists, the wave of support for independence didn\u2019t seem to ring any alarm bells in Westminster. Politicians appeared unconcerned that so many people were looking elsewhere for solutions to their problems. The Scottish Labour party made a terrible mistake during the campaign, taking its support for granted, failing to see that devolution had changed the terms of the debate and indulging in the kind of tribalist attacks on the SNP that had yielded results in previous decades.</p> <p>At the 2015 general election, it was the Liberal Democrats who were punished for taking voters for granted. In places such as the west country, the Lib Dems had been seen by many as a palatable anti-Conservative vote; putting the Tories into power destroyed that illusion. Their catastrophic loss of dozens of seats in places where they were the only viable opponents to the Conservatives had the effect of giving David Cameron a tiny majority. Westminster breathed a huge sigh of relief. Normal service had resumed.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Labour party members and supporters voted overwhelmingly for someone who challenged the Westminster consensus</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The Labour party was so convinced that things were back to normal that it took the extraordinary step of inviting supporters as well as members to vote in the election to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/may/16/labour-leadership-contenders-to-address-party-activists\" title=\"\">replace Ed Miliband</a> as leader. So certain was it that centrist candidates would win handsomely that it kindly lent its votes to a no-hope leftwing challenger, just to give the impression of choice. Taken for granted for many years, Labour party members and supporters <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/sep/12/jeremy-corbyn-wins-labour-party-leadership-election\" title=\"\">voted overwhelmingly</a> for someone who challenged the Westminster consensus, a decision that inspired thousands more to join the party.</p> <p>The final act of complacency came from Cameron, who took it for granted that a referendum on our membership of the European Union would produce a pro-remain vote so resounding that it would silence his critics on the Tory backbenches. Instead, those voters who felt ignored by Westminster for years took the opportunity to voice their anger.</p> <p>Overnight, a problem that had been brewing for years became glaringly apparent: the centre had lost control of the agenda. As panic set in, the Labour party at Westminster rebelled against its own membership, seeking to overturn the biggest mandate ever achieved by a Labour leader. And the Tories, unwilling in this febrile atmosphere to trust their own supporters, swiftly engineered the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jul/11/cameron-announces-he-will-step-down-after-pmqs-on-wednesday\" title=\"\">coronation of a new prime minister</a>. Ignoring the fact that the majority of their members had voted to leave the EU, they installed a leader from the remain campaign.</p> <p>Taken together, these electoral results represent an attempt by citizens to take back control from Westminster, where an inflexible voting system and the centralisation of policy-making has left people feeling that their voices are unheard, especially in England, where there has been no devolution of power from the centre. Voters are looking beyond the three-party centrist model that has dominated national politics for the past 70 years, making it difficult to produce policies that attract support across the UK.</p> <p>Yet barely a week goes by without one of the Labour rebels demanding that the party \u201cget back to winning ways\u201d, as if years of disconnection can be simply resolved by pulling the old levers that worked so well in the 20th century: triangulation not principle; decisions guided by focus groups not members; policies pitched solely to marginal swing seats rather than to the country as a whole and the party\u2019s core supporters taken for granted.</p> <p>Outlining this argument in Edinburgh was what got me into trouble in the Times, when I wondered out loud whether Corbyn fully understood the forces that had swept him to power. A parliamentarian for 33 years, does he recognise that the institution itself needs reform before a new political consensus can be built? I\u2019m not being disloyal when I ask Corbyn for his views on fair votes, federalisation and progressive alliances. I\u2019m just encouraging him to make the leap into 21st-century politics.</p>",

They offer a hopeful picture of how to engage kids in healthy eating:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p> All our main meals are cooked with fresh ingredients so we know what\u2019s going in. Kids are involved in the cooking (and growing food) so they learn to enjoy food. Sweet/sugary treats are not forbidden but are limited, usually as a treat with lunch or after school on a Friday. My kids are young enough that I don\u2019t have to worry about them eating junk food unless we give them it, they don\u2019t get fizzy juice and the diluting juice they do get is sugar free. We don\u2019t eat takeaways or prepacked food. Biggest issue is breakfast cereals, even Wheetabix has added sugar these days! <br></p> </blockquote> <p>They also talked about a great initiative their school is involved in:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Our school does a Wednesday wander where all the kids (preschool to p7) all walk, run, skip etc a mile every Wednesday. The kids love it!</p> <p><br> All the schools in the local area grow their own fruit and veg and do basic cooking with the ingredients they\u2019ve grown.

Medical experts and campaigners criticised the strategy \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/aug/18/childhood-obesity-strategy-wasted-opportunity-campaigners\">centred on the sugar tax \u2013 as \u201cweak and embarrassing\u201d</a>.</p> <p>The strategy relies on voluntary action by the food and drink industry, which has undertaken to reduce by 20% the amount of sugar in products such as cereals, desserts, yoghurts and sweets. It\u2019s been made clear to manufacturers that reducing sugar in their products means they will escape the sugar tax, not due to come in for two years.</p> <p>So, what do you think of these plans? The money the government make from it will go to fund breakfast clubs and sport (giving students an extra 30 minutes a day of physical activity). </p> <p>Alex Renton wrote about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/mar/20/sugar-tax-good-idea-go-after-processed-foods-next\">the benefits of a sugar tax in March, saying</a>: \u201cHundreds of millions will flow (if Osborne keeps his promise) into children\u2019s sports, neatly answering those who still believe, against the evidence, that the best way to address the excess calories modern children eat is through exercise.\u201d</p> <p>However, critics complain that this should go hand in hand with other measures proposed by Public <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/health\">Health</a> England: banning price-cutting promotions of junk food in supermarkets and restricting advertising of unhealthy food.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4cf872d9b430239a3fbfd7d913410f7f31f0c1ee\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4cf872d9b430239a3fbfd7d913410f7f31f0c1ee/0_112_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"burgers and chips\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>What\u2019s more, others feel that the sugar tax in its current form is an ineffective measure. The British Medical Association said: \u201cAlthough the government proposes targets for food companies to reduce the level of sugar in their products, the fact that these are voluntary and not backed up by regulation, renders them pointless. Targets are also needed to reduce levels of saturated fat and salt in products \u2013 these must be backed up by regulation.\u201d</p> <p>The British Soft Drinks Association is also unhappy the sugary drinks levy is going ahead. \u201cGiven the economic uncertainty our country now faces, we\u2019re disappointed the government wishes to proceed with a measure which analysis suggests will cause thousands of job losses and yet fail to have a meaningful impact on levels of obesity,\u201d said Gavin Partington, its director general. He added that manufacturers were already cutting the sugar content of their drinks.</p> <p>What do you think? Share your views with us by joining our debate here from 12pm-2pm.</p> </div>   </div>",

A multibillion-pound industry trades on our wish to be thin, in magazines, slimming products, diet fads and endless advice from pseudo-nutritionists. No public health campaign could begin to compete with the message sent out every day in every way that thin is beautiful, and fat is ugly, undesirable and a sign of moral uselessness. That\u2019s not a nudge, it\u2019s a daily knock on the head with a cudgel. \u201cYou can\u2019t be too rich or too thin,\u201d said Dorothy Parker.</p> <p>What no one says explicitly enough is that fat is a social class issue. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2004/may/28/society.publicservices1\" title=\"\">Most of the seriously obese are poor</a>.

The hyper-rich are called \u201cfat cats\u201d, but privilege is usually thin and sleek, its body well-exercised by gyms and personal trainers on diets of kale and goji berries. And even then, God knows, to be middle class doesn\u2019t guarantee thinness, as every ageing decade adds to girth. But poverty is a marker for most obesity.</p> <p>Reports suggest the poor find it harder to afford fresh fruit and vegetables, home cooking, and of course swimming pool and gym fees, ballet and judo lessons for their children. All true, but that\u2019s only part of the story. As some smug middle-class people remind us, well-educated penurious families can feed their children well on lentils, but that\u2019s irrelevant to life at the bottom of the social heap.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/jul/05/olympic-legacy-failure-sports-centres-council-cuts\">Olympic legacy failure: sports centres under assault by thousand council cuts</a> </p> </aside>  <p>To be obese signifies being poor and out of control, because people who feel they have no control over their own lives give up. What is there to struggle for if there is no chance ever of a job that will pay beyond bare subsistence? With no prospects, drinking, smoking and eating the wrong things become small compensations in lives with very little else. Being out of control becomes a mindset ever harder to climb out of. Why defer small gratifications when there is no greater reward on offer?</p> <p>Most people have social incentives not to give in to temptation \u2013 and even then we often fail \u2013 but those who have nothing are likely to give up more easily. From every social signal, poor children know from their first day at school that they are low in the pecking order and that gap between them and the rest widens with every school year, as their self-esteem falls away.</p> <p>Those on the margins, excluded from life\u2019s best things, eat themselves into an early grave. It is inequality and disrespect that make people fat. Look at the historical figures: obesity took off in the 1980s, up more than 400% in the years since inequality exploded. The link between inequality and obesity is stark around the world: among developed nations, America is the most unequal society and the fattest, with Britain and Australia next on both scores. Europe is better and the Scandinavian countries best of all.</p> <p>There may be social policy reasons, as social democratic governments invest in picking up family problems earliest. But the big picture is this: where the status and income gap in a society is smallest, so are the waistbands. Turn to that great classic of inequality research, The Spirit Level: Why Equality Is Better for Everyone, by Richard Wilkinson and Kate Pickett, and chapter seven documents how <a href=\"https://www.equalitytrust.org.uk/obesity\" title=\"\">wider income gaps mean wider waists</a>.</p> <p>That dispiriting fact could be an invitation to nothing-can-be-done fatalism, when of course governments should do all they can to stop the food industry making us all needlessly fatter, with the NHS picking up the bill. But yet again, social dysfunctions spring from the unequal state of the whole society.</p> <p>There is a nasty tendency to fat-shame the poor, a vicious cycle in which people are blamed individually for both their obesity and their poverty.</p> <p>But the social facts suggest Britain would get thinner if everyone had enough of life\u2019s opportunities to be worth staying thin for. Offer self-esteem, respect, good jobs, decent homes and some social status and the pounds would start to fall away.</p>",

At issue are claims made by Lochte that the group were held up at gunpoint by men posing as police but inconsistencies in their story have created Brazilian judicial interest and a media sensation.

  "<p>Theresa May during her leadership campaign to become prime minister said she wanted to tackle health inequalities. As prime minister she could help protect the next generation from diseases like type 2 diabetes, cancer, as well as reduce the crippling burden of obesity on the NHS. </p> <p>Instead, we have an insulting <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/aug/18/childhood-obesity-strategy-wasted-opportunity-campaigners\">response by her administration to the UK crisis in obesity</a> and type 2 diabetes \u2013 both in children and adults. The government, heavily influenced by food and drinks lobbyists, has rowed back on its promises by announcing what looks like a weak plan rather than the robust strategy it promised. It lacks any meaningful action and instead sings from the old hymn sheet about physical activity, personal responsibility, and voluntary product reformulation. What is needed is a level of intervention, regulation and enforcement by the state that is at least on a par with seatbelt use and not smoking indoors.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/aug/18/whats-the-answer-to-tackling-childhood-obesity-share-your-thoughts\">What's the answer to tackling childhood obesity? Share your thoughts</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In 2004, the World Health Organisation declared obesity a global epidemic. Twelve years later the statistics tell us that not only are we failing to tackle the issue, but it\u2019s getting worse. There are now <a href=\"http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/real-life-stories/one-million-morbidly-obese-britons-942572\">one million morbidly obese people in Britain</a>. Trends suggest that without effective intervention <a href=\"http://www.nhs.uk/change4life/supporter-resources/downloads/change4life_marketing%20strategy_april09.pdf\">nine out of 10 adults, and six out of 10 children, will be overweight or obese by 2050</a> (pdf). The association between <a href=\"http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/Coronary-heart-disease/Pages/Causes.aspx\">diet and heart disease</a> and cancer is irrefutable. </p> <p>The physical effects of obesity are plain to see. Mental health problems are less obvious. Obese children sometimes face depression, low self-esteem and bullying. Peer pressure can drive them to suicidal behaviour and affect their development and progression at school. It could be argued that diet-related ill health is set to cripple the NHS. It is estimated that the cost of obesity to the NHS in England in 2007 was \u00a34.2bn and has risen to over \u00a36bn in 2016.</p> <p>Supermarkets don\u2019t help \u2013 placing snacks such as crisps and chocolates in prominent positions. Fast-food restaurants not only proliferate, but big food corporations are the main sponsor of sports events. Food corporations often focus on personal responsibility as the cause of the nation\u2019s unhealthy diet and raise fears that government action challenges freedoms. This obscures the reality that some of the most significant health advances have been made by population-based public health approaches in which the overall welfare of the population trumps certain individual or industry freedoms. The public smoking ban is a prime example. It has already had an impact on reducing cardiovascular mortality. The government should ban the buy one, get one free culture for fizzy drinks and junk food. Wouldn\u2019t it be innovative for them to encourage supermarkets to promote the buy one vegetable get one free instead?<br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/jul/13/obesity-causes-premature-death-concludes-study-studies\">Obesity causes premature death, concludes study of studies</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Doctors are increasingly concerned about the impact of poor diet on the nation\u2019s health. It also directly affects GPs who face the challenge of routinely managing patients with complex, chronic conditions caused by factors beyond their clinical influence. It\u2019s high time that the government implemented not one but a series of robust measures through legislation to tackle this worsening crisis. There should be legislation to enforce supermarkets to avoid placing snacks such as crisps and chocolates in prominent positions; a ban on advertising unhealthy food and drink to children; mandatory traffic light labelling on food packaging; powers for councils to ban junk food adverts near schools. </p> <p>With diabetes already consuming 10% of NHS resources and one child in every four too heavy, the need to do something is urgent and plain. Government\u2019s prime responsibility is the health of its population, not the financial health of big food and drinks companies. The UK should lead the world in tackling obesity and type 2 diabetes and this is an embarrassing and inexcusable waste of a fantastic opportunity to put the nation\u2019s health first. We can beat child <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/obesity?src=hash\">obesity</a> but we need to tackle the food and drinks industry and complicit government policy first.</p> <p><strong>Do you work in the NHS?

  "<p>Early in my career as a junior doctor I had a rotation I was looking forward to, where I was working with different senior doctors in the mornings and afternoons. I was quite excited as this was definitely a part of medicine I was interested in. </p> <p>On one of my first days I arrived at 6.30am to meet my senior doctor. I waited in the pre-op area, a room with several beds and curtains where patients have their regular checks before an operation. A small congregation of doctors and nurses wandered in talking. I didn\u2019t know what the senior doctor who I would be working with looked like so I asked one of the nurses. \u201cYes, that\u2019s him there,\u201d she said with a cautious look. I walked proudly up to him and introduced myself.</p> <p>The senior doctor looked me up and down and said, \u201cWell done you\u201d, then brushed past me into the corridor. I scuttled after him thinking maybe he didn\u2019t realise \u201cI ... I think I\u2019m with you this morning?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes, yes I guess you are.\u201d</p> <p>I followed him into another room, starting to sweat slightly.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/healthcare-network/2016/aug/04/dont-be-smart-arse-junior-doctors-survival-guide\">'Don't be a smart arse' \u2013 a junior doctor's survival guide</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cHAT!\u201d shouted the nurse. \u201cYou need a hat!\u201d</p> <p>The senior doctor turned around: \u201cBetter get yourself a hat.\u201d He let go of the door which swung almost into my face. <br></p> <p>\u201cHat,\u201d I said to myself, but where? Feeling anxious I rushed around the theatres and found the changing rooms and finally a box of hats. I stumbled back into the room, the first patient had already been brought in. The senior doctor thrust a tray into my midriff: \u201cAny good with cannulas?\u201d</p> <p>I mumbled something about recently being on paediatrics and not having done that many yet; he interjected: \u201cGo on then.\u201d <br></p> <p>I smiled and introduced myself to the patient, applied the tourniquet, cleaned the area of skin and nervously began to insert. Feeling pressure, I was overjoyed to see flashback \u2013 a small spot of blood in the cannula that means you\u2019ve struck a vein. But on withdrawing the inner needle, no blood flowed. \u201cNo, no, no, you\u2019ve blown the vein. Here.\u201d The senior doctor stepped in and re-jigged the cannula correctly.</p> <p>A grilling started and even questions answered correctly were met with a look of them being barely acceptable. If wrong it was: \u201cI mean, you did pass your exams? You should know this.\u201d A humiliating dressing down in front of a sympathetic looking nurse. <br></p> <p>I was asked to perform a procedure I was unfamiliar with. Hands sweating, I tried my best but I struggled. \u201cCome on,\u201d he boomed. \u201cWe\u2019ve already discussed this \u2013 it won\u2019t be long before we have to start worrying.\u201d He sat back watching me struggle.

And if you don\u2019t fit into that narrow window, and you\u2019re poor, too bad. Our dysfunctional political system is putting people\u2019s health at risk and leading to a two-tiered system of testing.

  "<p>If you\u2019ve been to a Target, a Walmart or any other superstore in the last few weeks, you\u2019ve almost certainly seen them \u2013 parents with frazzled expressions, clutching lengthy shopping lists and pushing carts heaped high with school supplies ranging from backpacks and binders to scissors, crayons and an apparently infinite supply of composition notebooks.<br></p> <p>Perhaps you even count yourself among their number, and you\u2019re adding up the damage this back-to-school shopping binge has done to your family\u2019s budget. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2015/jan/23/obama-better-childcare-raise-childgivers-pay\">To provide better childcare, the US will have to raise caregivers' pay</a> </p> </aside>  <p>If you are feeling the pain, though, you can be fairly sure that your child\u2019s teacher is reeling. Cutbacks to school funding mean that budgets for items like markers, staplers and construction paper have been slashed to the bone. One Connecticut teacher <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/news/amid-education-cuts-teachers-scrimp-for-school-supplies/\">reported that her funding per child for the entire school year is now $1.60,</a> down from $15 about a dozen years ago. </p> <p>While teachers beg parents for help, and make pitches for support for specific projects from the general public on <a href=\"https://www.donorschoose.org/\">DonorsChoose.org</a>, they inevitably end up dipping into their own pockets to fill in the gaps. The average teacher forks over $500 of his or her own money every year, with 10% spending more than $1,000 on their students, for a total of $1.6bn nationwide.</p> <p>Meanwhile, there\u2019s new evidence that teachers are making an ever greater financial sacrifice in other ways. We\u2019re still prone to argue that while teachers tend to collect relatively small paychecks, relative to their levels of education and experience, their benefits help to compensate for that. That long summer holiday? The healthcare and other benefits? The pension?</p> <p>Well, <a href=\"http://www.epi.org/publication/teachers-make-17-percent-less-than-similar-workers/\">a new report from the Economic Policy Institute</a> tells us that it\u2019s time to re-evaluate our assumptions. In 1996, in absolute terms, teachers earned 4% less than workers with the same kinds of education and credentials. Today, that wage penalty is 17.3%. Adjusted for benefits, they are still 11% underpaid, compared to a 2% wage gap back in 1996.</p> <p>The report notes that this is most dramatic for women, for whom teaching was once a way to earn better wages than they could anywhere else. In 1960, the EPI notes, women teachers had a 14.7% wage gap in their favor. Today, they earn 13.9% less than they could, on average, by taking their skills elsewhere. </p> <p>Some teachers have done the math and are leaving the profession. One Florida woman wrote about what she described as the heart-breaking decision to do just that in the Palm Beach Post. She calculated that, at the age of 32, if she wanted to stop living with her parents and keep her teaching job, her current salary would leave her with <a href=\"http://extracredit.blog.palmbeachpost.com/2016/08/09/why-im-leaving-teaching-a-wellington-teachers-painful-decision/\">about $200 a month</a> for food, gas, cell phone, and any entertainment expenses. </p> <p>\u201cCould I count my pennies and scrape by? Barely,\u201d she wrote. \u201cBut what kind of life is that? And should I have to, with a college degree, after ten years of service, in a career that impacts the lives of our future leaders?\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s a reasonable question.</p> <p>Sadly enough, the cash-strapped position in which many teachers find themselves leaves them in the low- to middle-income part of the economy that is targeted by the same kind of lenders that seek to do business with people with poor or no credit, the underemployed, those without bank accounts or those with spotty work histories. </p> <p>Last month, the 600,000 or so members of New York State United Teachers, which includes classroom teachers as well as college and university faculty, staff and support staff, received <a href=\"https://nysut12.mypaycheckdirect.com/\">a catalog from MyPaycheckDirect</a>. Endorsed by the union\u2019s benefits department, the company \u2013 a division of Bluestem Brands, whose other businesses include the better-known Fingerhut \u2013 offers recipients the opportunity to buy a whole array of consumer goods and pay for it in a series of installments. The company minimizes its own risk by capping the amount that someone can buy based on salary and years of experience (if you\u2019re a teacher with only two years of experience, earning only $20,000, you can buy only $500 worth of goods; if you\u2019re making more than $34,000 a year and have been a member of the union for more than 20 years, you\u2019re eligible to spend up to $2,500). And of course, it also will have access to your paycheck, as its moniker implies.</p> <p>The company trumpets the ease and convenience of the plan. No credit check is required; you can make 26 biweekly payments or 12 monthly payments; best of all, it announces, there are no interest fees!</p> <p>The problem? Instead of paying interest, a teacher who opts for these installment purchase plan will end up paying a higher price for their new consumer item \u2013 often significantly higher \u2013 than they would if they had chosen to shop around and been in a position to pay conventionally, whether by using a credit card (even if it took a few months to pay off the full bill, meaning that they would end up paying a few dollars in interest as well as the principal).</p> <p>I conducted a completely random test of some 30 items, and discovered that every one of them carried a hefty premium price tag. The worst was an Ameriwood Cosco Leni Crib, priced at $659.99 (or $55 a month). For less than four monthly payments, a teacher could have purchased precisely the same crib from Amazon and several other sites; MyPaycheckDirect charged a 266.15% premium for the \u201cconvenience\u201d of the 12 monthly payments and no credit check. </p> <p>Anyone wanting to buy the Rockland three-piece metallic luggage set also faced an outsize premium (183%); they could have paid only $169.49 to Amazon for items for which MyPaycheckDirect are asking $479.99 (or $40 a month).</p> <p>Most of the other premiums are less extraordinary, but still hefty, especially when put in the context of a teacher\u2019s already limited budget. A 16-cup rice cooker, $40 at Kohl\u2019s, is $60.99 in the catalog; a Hoover cordless handheld vacuum that can be bought for $84.20 at Amazon is $159.99 here. An 80\u201d cat tree for your resident felines, $142.99 at Target, is $199.99 at MyPaycheckDirect. Interested in a LeapFrog LeapPad3 WiFi Learning Tablet? (It is back to school season, after all\u2026) Toys R Us and Walmart will both sell you one for about $90, but MyPaycheckDirect wants $129.99, 44.4% more. </p> <p>The icing on the cake: while many of those retailers also offer free shipping for big-ticket items, MyPaycheckDirect doesn\u2019t seem to do so. </p> <p>This online retail campaign isn\u2019t targeting the classic subprime consumer: people who have made poor financial choices and are suffering as a result. Instead MyPaycheckDirect appears to be directing its catalogs at civil servants and other individuals who earn less than other members of society simply because they\u2019ve chosen to put their personal wealth behind other considerations \u2013 like educating our children. The company clearly hopes that they\u2019ll throw financial caution to the wind, and overpay simply in exchange for the ability to pay a manageable amount each month. </p> <p>Carl Korn, a spokesman for NYSUT, says that inside every catalog there\u2019s a letter from the union\u2019s Member Benefits Department advising the recipient \u201cto shop and compare before making a purchase with PayCheckDirect and consider this program as an alternative to using their credit cards\u201d. The union also offers members an array of voluntary financial programs, including financial planning and credit counseling.</p> <p>\u201cIn a perfect world, consumers would always budget carefully, carry no credit card debt and save until they have enough money to purchase what they want,\u201d Korn adds. \u201cIn the real world, PayCheck Direct is an appealing option for some of our more than 600,000 members, especially those who might not have the means to purchase products like computers or refrigerators.\u201d</p> <p>Still, it\u2019s hard to imagine a case, based on the 30 or so items I looked at \u2013 other than an emergency replacement of a broken fridge or a dead laptop \u2013 where making a purchase from these catalogs is a better option than using a conventional credit card or simply saving a little bit from a paycheck each week or each month until they could purchase it outright.</p> <p>In the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis, we\u2019re all alert to the risks associated with predatory lenders. But what about a different kind of profiteer? Firms like Paycheck Direct are all too aware that teachers and others have fallen behind financially; that creates a great new market for them. The only way to fix that is to pay teachers what they\u2019re worth.</p> <p> </p>",

  "<p>It is high summer, a time when many of us are forced to face up to a deeply unpalatable truth: that, when it comes to food, we are nothing more than slatterns. For this is the one time of the year when, in preparation for going on holiday, we can be guaranteed to clean the fridge. And I mean clean it properly. Of course, there will be people rolling their eyes at this; the ones who clean their fridge weekly and keep a pack of wet wipes to hand for whenever they have to touch door handles or stroke their children\u2019s hair.</p> <p>Everyone else will be nodding in recognition. As a warm-up for the food panel show I present for BBC Radio 4, I often ask audiences how often they clean their fridge. (Oh yeah, I know how to entertain.) The number that say it\u2019s every week can be counted on the fingers of one hand after that hand has been through an industrial accident. For the rest the deep cleanse really is just a once a year job.</p> <p>I understand why this is \u2013 because I am one of them. I mean to do better, but it doesn\u2019t quite happen. The fridge is a big white box. White means clean. It\u2019s also cold in there and cold means fresh. That\u2019s the point of the fridge, isn\u2019t it? It\u2019s a fridge ergo it\u2019s clean and fresh. And then we prepare to go away on holiday and we spot the half-finished bottle of milk and we know instinctively what we must do. We start to unload and are brought face to face with our own quietly liquefying shame.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/aug/24/why-my-fridge-makes-me-feel-guilty\">Why my fridge makes me feel guilty</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The mouldering vegetal matter we didn\u2019t get round to using, the turnips the organic veg box merchants insist on stuffing in the bottom to make up the numbers, are only part of the story.

The \u201cgood idea at the time\u201d jars. Gingerly you unscrew the lids to find so much furry mould you don\u2019t know whether to spoon it into the bin, or comb it.

You spot the other jars, their lids jammed in place by clots of suppurating matter that have dribbled themselves all over the lump of Pyrenean cheese you once had a now long-forgotten plan for.</p> <p>We like to think of ourselves as health and safety conscious.

Hieronymus Bosch wouldn\u2019t have the imagination with which to depict the horror of hidden mould and contagion. The one we are confronted with every year at this time. So we knuckle down, pull out the shelves, swab the interior and promise ourselves that when we return from holiday it will be a new start. Which it won\u2019t be. Because it never is. But hey, it\u2019s the thought that counts. I just hope the holiday was worth it.</p>",

This policy has over-promised, but I fear that the reality will be under-delivery.\u201d </p> <p>The sugar tax should be extended to all heavily sugared foods, not just soft drinks, he said. \u201cA sugar tax should be broadly welcomed, but it remains unclear how this will be implemented, why it will be limited just to soft drinks and not include sugary foods, and how it will avoid becoming a tax that unintentionally penalises fruit juice, and as a result farmers and food producers,\u201d said Poulter. </p> <p>He said measures to boost school sport \u201csound good, particularly during the Olympics. But there is a worrying lack of practical measures about how we can turn warm words into reality. There is also an urgent need for more joined-up government thinking to ensure that regular physical activity as well as personal and social education, which includes important public health messages, becomes mandatory in all schools.\u201d</p> <p>Lamb, like Poulter a health minister alongside Hunt until May 2015, described the action plan as \u201ca massive damp squib\u201d. He said: \u201cGiven Jeremy Hunt\u2019s rhetoric we were entitled to expect something a bit more dramatic and effective than what we got. Is this really the best response to a \u2018growing public health catastrophe\u2019, or \u2018national emergency\u2019? Can it really be described as a \u2018game-changing moment\u2019?\u201d </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/live/2016/aug/18/is-a-sugar-tax-enough-to-tackle-childhood-obesity-live-debate\">Is a sugar tax enough to tackle childhood obesity? \u2013 live debate</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Poulter sharply criticised the plan\u2019s continued reliance on voluntary action by the food industry to tackle children\u2019s expanding waistlines. Food and soft drink producers could not be trusted to take action to boost health, he said. Health charities believe that the \u201cresponsibility deal\u201d begun by then health secretary, Andrew Lansley, in 2010, under which manufacturers and sellers pledged to improve their practices to reduce obesity and alcohol misuse, has failed. </p> <p>\u201cLooking more closely at some of these plans, I have concerns, because when we draw on learned experience of corporate behaviour, we know that the continuation of a policy of hoping that sugary drinks and junk food manufacturers will want to start working with government to drastically reduce unhealthy sugar content is unlikely to be successful,\u201d Poulter said. </p> <p>\u201cThe responsibility deal has failed to deliver and has revealed a woeful lack of corporate responsibility. Junk food and sugary drink manufacturers have shown that they can be no more trusted to help help tackle childhood obesity than drinks companies can be to play their part in reducing irresponsible drinking habits.\u201d</p> <p>Poulter said ministers should recognise that evidence showed increasing the price of products that can harm health decreased both demand and consumption. \u201cSo we need strong legislation, for example through increases in VAT, that will increase the price of junk food,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the leader of Britain\u2019s paediatricians has accused ministers of letting children down and risking the public\u2019s health by discarding plans that would have made the UK a world leader in tackling obesity. </p> <p>\u201cWhat is deeply saddening, because they can\u2019t exercise personal responsibility, is the failure of the state to protect infants and children,\u201d said Prof Neena Modi, president of the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health. She was extremely disappointed that the government\u2019s \u201cweak\u201d plan had eschewed necessarily \u201ctough policies\u201d, such as taxing unhealthy foods, limiting the number of fast food outlets near schools and banning the advertising of foods high in fat, salt or sugar. </p> <p>\u201cHad measures such as these been put forward, the UK would have a strategy of which to be proud. Instead, infants and children have been let down, and because the overwhelming majority of obese children will become obese adults, government is placing the health of the entire nation in grave jeopardy,\u201d Modi said. <br></p> <p>Prof John Middleton, president of the Faculty of Public Health (FPH), the UK professional body for public health specialists, said the plan \u201clet down a generation of children by not going far enough to tackle childhood obesity\u201d.</p> <p>He said: \u201cFPH remains fully supportive of a duty on sugary drinks a part of a wider strategy to tackle childhood obesity, and is very disappointed that the necessary, evidence-based measures to make the duty a success are not included in this report. These include tougher regulations of junk food marketing to children, particularly online, where there are far fewer restrictions.</p> <p>Anna Taylor, executive director of the Food Foundation, said: \u201cThis represents a gear change, but is nowhere near the \u201cgame-change\u201d promised by Jeremy Hunt. It\u2019s good to see better commitments on reformulation but there is so much missing! </p> <p>\u201cChildren and their parents are being systematically targeted with adverts, promotions and brand awareness of unhealthy foods \u2013 they can\u2019t escape. Any parent waking up this morning in the hope that the government would help them protect their child from obesity will be bitterly disappointed.\u201d</p> <p>A Coca-Cola Great Britain spokesperson said: \u201cWe agree with the government that obesity rates are too high, but we do not believe a tax on only some soft drinks with sugar will reduce them. What it will do is hit consumers in the pocket and damage a range of businesses up and down the country. <br></p> <p>\u201cBy reformulating 28 of our drinks since 2005, giving consumers even clearer nutritional information on our packs and investing more in marketing our no-sugar options, we have contributed to a significant reduction in sugar consumption from soft drinks over the last decade \u2013 and a 16% reduction in the last four years alone. </p> <p>\u201cDuring this time there has been no corresponding decline in obesity rates. A policy focused on a single nutrient in narrow range of products \u2013 that provide an average of just 5% of the total calories in a British teenager\u2019s diet \u2013 is not the right response.\u201d<br></p>",

  "<p>Growing up a century ago, Henry Farrell did not dream of playing for the red, white and blue. Or of competing in the Olympics, for that matter.</p> <p>There really wasn\u2019t any national side to think of. The US national soccer team had performed but twice \u2013 both times overseas in 1916 \u2013 so there were few inspirations and larger-than-life role figures to emulate.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/jun/10/pele-bobby-moore-usa-bicentennial-cup\">When Pele and Bobby Moore took on the world's best \u2013\u00a0for Team America</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Fifa was just finding its bearings, having been founded in 1904.</p> <p>Olympic soccer had hardly forged a great tradition, because only five tournaments had been held, with only European teams participating and with England winning the gold three times.</p> <p>And the advent of the World Cup was still years away.</p> <p>Yet Farrell and his United States team-mates wound up making history in 1924, becoming the first American national team to play and record a win a game in a major international competition \u2013 and on foreign soil.</p> <p>His granddaughter, Sue Beatrice, recently told the Guardian that Farrell talked about the Olympics quite a bit.</p> <p>\u201cThey had an enormous impact on his life, to the point when he became a police officer when he did not get into the next Olympics,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Farrell was a handful on the soccer field. He was around 5ft 6in and 140lb, Beatrice remembered, not necessarily the most intimidating presence on the pitch. Whatever Farrell might have lacked in his physical presence was compensated for by skill, tactical knowledge, shooting ability and pace. Oh, did he love to run.</p> <p>Beatrice rode her bicycle to visit Farrell when he was in a New Jersey nursing home.</p> <p>\u201cHis spirits were still up,\u201d she said. \u201cOnce he ended up in a wheelchair. I said: \u2018Oh my God, it\u2019s downhill from here.\u2019 He used to race the wheelchair around. They asked him to stop. They finally gave up and they had wheelchair races around the place.\u201d</p> <p>Farrell was a gamer. He never wanted to come out and played many times with injuries. \u201cApparently he played a game with a broken leg,\u201d Beatrice said. \u201cHe wouldn\u2019t give up. He was feisty. He was a tough guy. He was not a large man. He was athletic.\u201d</p> <p>According to one newspaper account, Farrell suffered two broken kneecaps, broken ankles, legs and ribs in his career. One Philadelphia sportswriter wrote that \u201cFarrell is such a \u2018spotted\u2019 player that he is also compelled to take lot of punishment.\u201d</p> <p>Those injuries probably caught up with Farrell, who lost both legs in his later years. \u201cDue to the injuries he did receive in soccer, he had circulation problems, lost a toe, eventually lost both legs, I was told,\u201d Beatrice said. \u201cI don\u2019t know if that was the case. He wasn\u2019t diabetic.\u201d</p> <p>In his prime, he was among the best the USA had to offer.</p> <p>It shouldn\u2019t be surprising that Farrell developed a passion and excelled at the beautiful game. Born in Philadelphia on 2 October 1902, Henry Charles Farrell was the son of John B Farrell, a pioneer of the game in the USA. In the late 19th century, John Farrell promoted the sport and eventually become president of the Football Association of Eastern Pennsylvania and District.</p> <p>Then president of the Allied Association of Philadelphia, John Farrell played a vital role in the founding of the US Soccer Federation, as we know it now, in 1913. He decided to leave the American Football Association (created in 1884) and back the new organization, the United States Football Association. Farrell and Douglas Stewart, president of the Referee\u2019s Association of Philadelphia, agreed to pay half the expenses of the very first meeting, according to the PhillySoccerPage.com.</p> <p>Farrell attended that gathering at the Astor House in New York City on 5 April 1913 and served on the committee that drafted the organization\u2019s constitution.</p> <p>At the time of the creation of the USFA, Henry Farrell was 10 years old and just getting started. In 1914, he was a member of the Brook\u2019s school, which won the city public school championship. While attending West Philadelphia high school, moved up the ladder in the Allied League, winning titles and filling the net with the Philadelphia Textile Club, Nativity, Atlantic City and Marshall E Smith teams before joining Fairhill SC, a top amateur team, in 1923-24.</p> <p>\u201cIt is somewhat curious, but this player has always played with a team that has finished either in the champion or runner-up position,\u201d one local newspaper reported. \u201cThis alone proves his capabilities as a leader of the attack and still more will be seen and heard of this player in another season or two. He is the \u2018goods\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>Farrell\u2019s personal scrapbook was filled with dozens of stories about Fairhill\u2019s victories, league titles and his scoring exploits. He was good for at least one goal a game. One article claimed he averaged 45 goals a season.</p> <p>His reputation preceded him. Farrell and several Philadelphia area players were invited to try out for the US Olympic team that had been invited to play at the 1924 Games; there was no qualifying back then.</p> <p>Quite appropriately, the final tryout was held at Olympic Park in Paterson, New Jersey. Candidates were divided into three groups that played three 30-minute periods with a five-minute break between each one. Farrell was in the first group, which played against Scott AA of Passaic, New Jersey. Eventually, US soccer officials and selected 17 players (though most of the 23 Olympic soccer teams deployed 22-man rosters) who had about a week to prepare for their long journey to France. Eight players were from Philadelphia; four from Fleisher Yarn, two from Disston FC and two from Fairhill.</p> <p>George M Collins, who wrote soccer columns for the Boston Globe, was named manager. He was soccer crazy himself. Once after breaking his leg, he played under the name of George Mathews so his wife wouldn\u2019t worry about him. George Burford was the coach.</p> <p>Joined by US Olympic Committee vice-president Col AG Mills, the team embarked on the SS America from New York for a 10-day voyage across the Atlantic. The players trained twice a day \u2013 morning and afternoon on the ship. The morning session was dominated by calisthenics and gym work, while the afternoon workouts included shooting, heading, trapping and jogging.</p> <p>\u201cOne of my grandfather\u2019s memories of the Olympics was shooting craps on the boat,\u201d Beatrice said with a laugh. \u201cHe made friends there. They gambled and had fun. It was a whole different world for him. He got a kick out of that. He had a lot of photos. I think he called them prayer groups, where they\u2019re all kneeling and they\u2019re actually shooting craps.\u201d</p> <p>The US team disembarked in Cherbourg on 19 May, \u201csinging, cheering and exuberant\u201d, according to one newspaper, before venturing to Paris to prepare for their first-round game against Estonia (many newspapers spelled it Esthonia back then) six days later at what is known today as The \u201cChariots of Fire\u201d Olympics.</p> <p>They players were not in the same good spirits when they saw their accommodations at the Olympic Village, adjacent to Colombes Stadium. They staged a revolt, claiming the food was unsatisfactory and their living quarters were infested. Arrangements were made to move the team to a hotel about a half-hour from the middle of Paris, Sam Foulds and Paul Harris wrote in their book, America\u2019s Soccer Heritage.</p> <p>Unlike today\u2019s four-team groups, that competition was single-elimination; one loss and you were out, so each team was on the edge. Back then, it was supposed to be an amateur tournament, but some teams utilized professionals.</p> <p>In the opener, the crowd of 7,475 at Pershing Stadium was \u201csomewhat hostile\u201d to the Americans, the Associated Press said. The team was greeted with boos and hisses, Foulds and Harris wrote.</p> <p>The USA starting XI: Jimmy Douglas (Newark FC); Irving Davis (Fairhill), Arthur Rudd (Fleisher Yarn), F Jones (Bridgeville FC); Ray Hornberger (Disston FC), Fred O\u2019Connor (Lynn GE), William Findlay (New York Galicia), Dr Aage Brix (Los Angeles AC); Andy Straden (Fleisher Yarn), Henry Farrell (Fairhill), Samuel Dalrymple (Disston FC).</p> <p>A struggling USA side managed to secure the lone goal of the match from Andy Straden\u2019s (his name also was spelled Stradan in several sources) penalty-kick in the 10th minute.</p> <p>Ten minutes into the second half, Estonia were awarded a penalty-kick. Depending on which story you believe, Elmar Kaljot either hit the post or booted his attempt over the crossbar. The referee claimed Kaljot kicked the ball before his whistle, so he was allowed to retake it. His second attempt hit the woodwork. Douglas gathered in the rebound and the USA managed to close out a 1-0 win.</p> <p>\u201cIt is a fallacy to say that a winning match is always a well-played match,\u201d Collins, the coach, was quoted by AP. \u201cI am not quite satisfied with the showing of our boys, but we will put in some hard licks between now and the second round. If, as we hope, Uruguay defeated Yugoslavia tomorrow, and we were drawn against them, we will try and make it interesting for our South American brothers.\u201d</p> <p>Well, be careful what you wish for, because the Uruguayans rolled to a 7-0 triumph over Yugoslavia. Uruguay was at the verge of its golden age in which they won back-to-back Olympic soccer gold medals and the first World Cup in 1930. Few international soccer experts realized how good this team was and how many players would become legends.</p> <p>The walking wounded Americans were forced to replace Brix and Rudd. Farrell also was hurting, but he played anyway. It was not known who had what ailment, although one Paris newspaper reported players had wrenched shoulders, sprained ankles and sore legs.</p> <p>The USA never had a chance. Uruguay made a hero out of goalkeeper Jimmy Douglas, who produced several vital saves in a 3-0 result. Douglas wound up on the 1928 Olympic team and on the side that participated in that inaugural World Cup in Uruguay. Legendary midfielder Jos\u00e9 Leandro Andrade, the first player nicknamed the Black Pearl (Pel\u00e9 was the second), masterminded the attack. Pedro Petrone scored twice and H\u00e9ctor Scarone added another.</p> <p>\u201cUruguay deserved victory and won largely through miraculous team work,\u201d Collins was quoted by the Philadelphia Evening Bulletin. \u201cIt is easy to understand why Uruguay won,\u201d American Olympic Committee member Peter Peel told the Philadelphia Evening Bulletin. \u201cIn our sense of the word, the Uruguayans are not amateurs, but professionals. They have played together for years and represented their country in many previous contests. On the other hand, our team scarcely knew each other at all before the present games.\u201d</p> <p>That latter scenario began an unwanted US national team tradition that lasted until the 1970s.</p> <p>Upon returning home, Farrell resumed his career with Fairhill with memories, pictures of him and his team-mates and a participation medal he held dear to his heart.</p> <p>\u201cI was under the illusion for a long time that he had won a gold medal as kid,\u201d Beatrice said.</p> <p>\u201cHe started showing that to me when I was four. He was very proud of it. Kept it wrapped in velvet, in a pouch and in a little wooden box. He had five different medals that he would show me. They were from different things that he won. The biggest, the heaviest, the most amazing one was that participation medal. I was impressed by it. It was a big shiny object. As a kid, gold star stickers impressed me, so that was over the top. I had friends over and I would ask him to bring it out and show them. He loved doing that.\u201d</p> <p>Farrell was dedicated to the game. He married Caroline Purdy one Sunday morning in 1927. \u201cHe was married in the morning and played that afternoon,\u201d his daughter Carolyn told the Philadelphia Bulletin in 1979. \u201cHe went right to the game \u2013 that was the honeymoon.\u201d</p> <p>His scoring accomplishments continued with hopes of playing at the 1928 Olympic Games in Amsterdam. Farrell was relentless, converting a hat-trick in a 3-2 win over the Kensington Blue Bells in November 1927 and connecting for four goals in a 5-3 result over the Lighthouse Blues in February 1928.</p> <p>Those type of performances had to put Farrell high on the list of candidates, but he was rejected by the American Olympic Committee because he was deemed to be a professional.</p> <p>\u201cThey were trying to make ends meet and he wound up coaching some kids over the summer and took money for it,\u201d Beatrice said. \u201cBack then the rules were so strict that made him a professional. He said that\u2019s what got him booted out.\u201d</p> <p>Undaunted, Farrell continued playing, joining the New York Nationals in the American Soccer League.</p> <p>He pulled off a rare double against a touring Italian Olympic team. While wearing the colors of a Philadelphia all-star team, he set up one goal in an 8-3 loss in Philadelphia on 11 August 1928. (An interesting aside: the Italian team did a fascist \u201csalute, while several 100 spectators sat spellbound\u201d, the New York Times reported).</p> <p>Wearing the uniform of the Nationals the next day, Farrell created the lone goal in a 3-1 defeat to the same Italian side before 10,000 spectators at the Polo Grounds in New York City.</p> <p>With injuries slowing him down, Farrell decided to become a Philadelphia policeman. He continued to play on the weekends and coached in the Police Athletic League.</p> <p>While his police exploits did not grab the same headlines he made in soccer, Farrell produced several feats of heroism.</p> <p>In 1934, he saved the life of a 10-year-old girl who was set ablaze by her father. In 1954, he received a commendatory letter from Philadelphia commissioner Thomas J Gibbons for saving a man\u2019s life. He was also one of the first policemen to use a radio-equipped patrol car to arrive at crime scenes quickly.</p> <p>\u201cHe was a crossing guard until he could no longer stand,\u201d Beatrice said. \u201cHe would be out there, rain or shine, day or night, making sure the kids got across the highway. The little town we had [Centre City, New Jersey] was divided by a very busy highway. If kids didn\u2019t cross where he was, they took an enormous risk. A lot of dedication there.\u201d</p> <p>Henry C Farrell died at the age of 77 in May 1980, leaving behind a family, scoring exploits during the early days of American soccer and a legacy that will be difficult to duplicate.</p>",
  "<p>It\u2019s been nearly 25 years since Anita Hill, a lawyer and law professor, testified before the US Senate judiciary committee about the sexual harassment she allegedly experienced at the hands of then US supreme court justice nominee (and fellow lawyer) Clarence Thomas. Though Thomas was ultimately confirmed to the court, the hearings and the media coverage led to <a href=\"https://chnm.gmu.edu/courses/122/hill/hillframe.htm\">a rapid uptick</a> in the filing of sexual harassment complaints and federal awards to victims, and a broader understanding of what qualifies as gender discrimination and sexual harassment.</p> <p>Except, it seems, in some parts of the legal profession: it was only last week that the American Bar Association <a href=\"http://www.americanbar.org/news/abanews/aba-news-archives/2016/08/house_approves_host.html\">adopted</a> a <a href=\"http://www.americanbar.org/content/dam/aba/administrative/professional_responsibility/final_revised_resolution_and_report_109.authcheckdam.pdf\">model rule</a> to encourage state bar associations to prohibit and sanction sexist, racist and other discriminatory comments and conduct by lawyers. </p> <p>Mark Johnson Roberts, chair of the ABA\u2019s commission on sexual orientation and gender identity, provided an example of an incident that happened to a colleague in Oregon. \u201cIt\u2019s a business social event, and her opposing counsel in one of her cases is there,\u201d he said. \u201cTo make a long story short, he grabs her butt. She tells him, \u2018My husband isn\u2019t going to appreciate that, please stop.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLater in the party, he comes up, hugs her and grabs her breast. She bolts away, and he follows her. He corners her and he asks her in the crudest possible terms first, whether she was going to copulate with her husband that evening and second, whether she was going to perform fellatio upon him.\u201d Preferring not to pursue criminal charges for the assault, she went to the state bar and, he said, was told there was no recourse unless he had a criminal conviction. She later filed criminal charges and he was convicted, and Oregon has since amended its state rules.</p> <p>Though <a href=\"http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation-now/2016/08/10/lawyers-stop-saying-honey-sweetheart-court/88510246/\">characterized in some media</a> coverage as a rule that would bar judges and lawyers from calling women \u201choney\u201d or \u201csweetheart\u201d in legal settings, the new rule would go much further, barring \u201charassment and discriminatory conduct based on race, religion, sex, disability, LGBTQ status and other factors when such conduct is related to the practice of law\u201d in state bar associations that adopted it. Punishment for offenders found to have violated the rule would vary, but could involve official warnings, fines and, in egregious cases, potential disbarment.</p> <p>Only 25 state bar associations and the District of Columbia currently prohibit such discrimination and harassment, which means that lawyers in half the country who have been subjected to it \u2013 and especially those in private practice \u2013 have little, if any, professional recourse. </p> <p>In the US, state bar associations are responsible for sanctioning lawyers (including disbarring them) for professional misconduct. Without a prohibition on harassment and discrimination, conduct that could be considered a fireable offense in many American workplaces would have limited consequences for lawyers who engage in it.</p> <p>Lori Rifkin, a trial lawyer in northern California, is one of a small number of female lawyers who have successfully <a href=\"http://abovethelaw.com/2016/01/lawyer-receives-stern-benchslap-and-amazing-sanction-for-sexist-deposition-comment/\">obtained sanctions</a> against lawyers who made sexist comments in a professional setting. As part of a more expansive motion to have a male opposing counsel in a case sanctioned for a variety of what she and her co-counsel termed \u201csubstantial discovery misconduct\u201d, she was able to present evidence of him using sexist language to disparage her. </p> <p>While questioning her opponent\u2019s client in a deposition, she said that the male opposing counsel kept cutting her off, and as she was objecting to his behavior for the record he did so again. </p> <p>\u201cHe told me that my behavior was not becoming of a woman,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd then he stopped.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThere was kind of a gasp in the room,\u201d Rifkin said \u2013 a room that included a female court reporter and several other lawyers \u2013 \u201cand he added: \u2018Or an attorney who is acting professionally.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>While researching her efforts to sanction the lawyer in the case, Rifkin found that there were only two other successful motions in similar cases, despite the fact she had experienced sexist comments from her earliest days as a lawyer. \u201cI\u2019ve dealt with \u2013 and I\u2019m sure you can pick any woman attorney off the street and she\u2019s dealt with \u2013 comments like these. It\u2019s just so rarely this clear and on the record.\u201d </p> <p>The judge in the case excoriated the opposing counsel for his remarks, and levied a fine.</p> <p>But <a href=\"http://abovethelaw.com/tag/the-pink-ghetto/\">stories like Rifkin\u2019s</a> are all too common, even if court filings and sanctions against offenders are not. \u201cI\u2019m 37, and I have supervised numerous<strong> </strong>female attorneys younger than I, and I can confidently say that [this behavior] is not going extinct,\u201d she added.</p> <p>Katina Ancar, who currently works as in-house counsel for a public agency in California but used to work at a law firm, has had to find ways to cope with both gender and racial discrimination in her career, mostly from clients and co-workers.</p> <p>\u201cVery recently, I had a very senior employment lawyer, the most senior employment attorney in the organization \u2013 a white woman \u2013 walk up to me,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd her hand came at me, and as she\u2019s doing it, she says: \u2018I know I shouldn\u2019t be doing this\u2019, and then she put her hand in my hair.\u201d</p> <p>Many African Americans view the tendency of some white people to, without permission, fondle their natural hair <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2011/LIVING/07/25/touching.natural.black.hair/\">a racist act</a>. \u201cI wasn\u2019t a person,\u201d she said. \u201cI was an object for her.\u201d</p> <p>Ancar, who had only recently cut her hair in order to transition to a more natural style, found out it wasn\u2019t her co-worker\u2019s first time touching the hair of African American employees. \u201cI told another African American attorney in the office, and she said: \u2018Yeah, she\u2019s done it to me.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>But it was often clients, Ancar said, who engaged in the most discriminatory action. Some, for instance, often refused to let the young female associates make court appearances, even though they did the bulk of work on most cases. \u201cWe\u2019ve had to use statements by judges [in support of the associates who write the briefs presenting them in court] to convince even our female clients to allow female associates to appear in court,\u201d she said, because there was no direct way to call the behavior discriminatory without alienating the client. </p> <p>\u201cYou get sexism from men, but it permeates the way women think as well.\u201d</p> <p>Paula Brantner, a lawyer and consultant who formerly ran the nonprofit Workplace Fairness, said of the American Bar Association\u2019s model rule: \u201cIt\u2019s one of those things that I think was obviously overdue.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou would think the profession would be able to police itself, that this would be a no-brainer,\u201d she added. \u201cBut it\u2019s happening in the courtrooms, it\u2019s happening between opposing counsel and co-workers, it\u2019s happening outside the office in professional settings.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not about the competitive practice of law. It\u2019s about people seeking to assert power over other people, and this is one way they do it.\u201d</p> <p>Rifkin agreed. \u201cThe fact that it took until 2016 is emblematic of an ongoing problem in the legal profession,\u201d she said. \u201cThe idea that sexism or racism or homophobia have somehow gone away or become less prevalent in the legal profession is a myth.\u201d</p> <p>And though Rifkin\u2019s successful case against her opposing counsel drew plenty of media coverage at the time, she\u2019s not sure it changed enough minds. \u201cAs recently as last week,\u201d she explained, \u201can attorney approximately my age, the first thing he said to me in a deposition was: \u2018Calm down.\u2019\u201d</p>",

Since those discussions began in 2012 the Ogiek have been allowed to live undisturbed on the land.</p> <p> But the boundary between the 17,000-hectare (42,000-acre) reserve and KFS-controlled land has never been made fully clear, says Justin Kenrick of the <a href=\"http://www.forestpeoples.org/\">Forest Peoples Programme</a>, an NGO that has been working with the Ogiek. </p> <p>Kenya\u2019s 2010 constitution protects indigenous rights to land, but the community land bill that is meant to put these into law is yet to be passed by parliament.</p> <p> <a href=\"https://composer.gutools.co.uk/content/578f4bcae4b03c1910482ffc#sdfootnote2sym\"></a>\u201c[Ogiek] rights have been brutalised,\u201d says Esther Mwangi, a scientist at the <a href=\"http://www.cifor.org/\">Centre for International Forestry Research</a>. \u201cA lot of this happens because of the lack of political power and influence.\u201d</p> <p>Things had been looking up for the Ogiek of Mount Elgon. They have written bylaws to ensure protection of the forest \u2013 which have been shared with government agencies, as part of their fight to convince the authorities that they had coexisted with the forest and its wildlife for centuries. They were also working with the KFS and <a href=\"http://www.kws.go.ke/\">Kenya Wildlife Service</a> to hand over poachers and illegal charcoal burners.

Kitelo claims trees are not being replanted and that farming is covering about 30,000 hectares, three times the area it is supposed to cover. Meanwhile, the KFS maintains that conservation requires the forest to be uninhabited.</p> <p>\u201cThere was no one living there,\u201d says Alex Lemarkoko, the KFS\u2019s head of enforcement, who claims that in June his team were only \u201cclearing\u201d the area of livestock herders. \u201cIn terms of evictions \u2013 no we have not done evictions.\u201d</p> <p> Lemarkoko also denied the existence of villages on the moors above the forest. \u201cIt is too high, people cannot live there \u2013 they don\u2019t live there,\u201d he says. \u201cHunting and gathering is a primitive practice, it doesn\u2019t happen in Kenya.\u201d</p> <p>The KFS believes people and wildlife must be kept separate. But, as Kenrick points out, numerous studies have shown that <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://bit.ly/1kpdAVW\">indigenous groups are often the most effective guardians of forests</a>. \u201cThe colonial approach to conservation has involved evicting the very communities who have sustained their lands for centuries or millennia, leaving their forests at the mercy of those whose only interest is in exploiting them,\u201d he says.</p> <p> This \u201ccolonial approach\u201d is followed across Kenya.

Yet the most straightforward, persuasive description persists: it is a documentary about competitive tickling.<br></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iOBXuCYB4jQ\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/iOBXuCYB4jQ?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>\u201cIn a perfect world, I kind of don\u2019t want people to know anything about it,\u201d Farrier says by phone from Auckland.</p> <p>\u201cThinking it\u2019s going to be a light documentary about competitive tickling \u2013 that\u2019s the best possible way to go into the film.\u201d </p> <p>In his native New Zealand, Farrier is known for his good-humoured, straight-faced odd spots on late-night television news, which range from his search for the Mongolian death worm purported to live in the Gobi desert, to a heart-to-heart with Justin Bieber in the star\u2019s Baby days.</p> <p>Easygoing, affable and normal \u2013 the straight man to the world\u2019s apparently infinite reserves of weirdness \u2013 he has characterised himself in the past as a \u201cquirky-story-light-fluff-journo\u201d.</p> <p>Outside of New Zealand, he\u2019s become known as \u201cNew Zealand\u2019s Louis Theroux\u201d. There is even a physical resemblance, as described by one journalist as \u201cnerdy-looking\u201d. Farrier posted a screenshot of this to Instagram, with three red-faced scowling emojis and the hashtags \u201c#hot #cool #coolguy\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a82e31006106e31e0aee552d4923b656c3ac408f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a82e31006106e31e0aee552d4923b656c3ac408f/0_0_5760_3840/1000.jpg\" alt=\"David Farrier\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018New Zealand\u2019s Louis Theroux\u2019: Tickled director David Farrier</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: A Ticklish Tale Limited</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>When he first came across Jane O\u2019Brien Media back in 2014, he had planned to make a two-minute clip about competitive tickling for his then employers at TV3. But a representative responded to his interview request with hostility, saying that to \u201cassociate with a homosexual journalist\u201d would bring the \u201cpassionately and exclusively heterosexual athletic endurance activity\u201d into disrepute. (Farrier is in fact bisexual.)</p> <p>Undeterred, Farrier wrote three blog posts detailing their interactions, escalating to personal slurs sent over email and legal threats from within New Zealand and the US.</p> <p>Then he was told that Jane O\u2019Brien was sending three employees to New Zealand, with, he understood, the intention of forcing him to drop the project: \u201cIt was like, obviously, they do have a shitload of money \u2026 they\u2019re not joking,\u201d he says.</p> <p>The three posts were subsequently pulled from TV3\u2019s website for their risk of defamation. Farrier started to think that the story \u2013 whatever it was \u2013 demanded a closer look.</p> <p>With co-director Dylan Reeve, a fellow Aucklander who\u2019d been following the story, he launched a crowdfunding bid to pursue the project.</p> <p>\u201cIt was my suspicion that there was enough going on that there would be some kind of something worth watching \u2013 whether it was a feature-length thing, a video for Vimeo \u2013 and it just kind of grew from there,\u201d he says.</p> <p>The Kickstarter page raised close to NZD$30,000 in three weeks. The 92-minute documentary was cut and completed within about 18 months of his first contact with Jane O\u2019Brien Media. Farrier took unpaid leave from TV3 for the shoot and quit before the film\u2019s premiere at Sundance. It came together fast, says Farrier \u2013 but that\u2019s how the story unfolded. \u201cIt feels representative of what happened to me.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"b9ec3b2393cd85b7a3d59fb38b871c914655e3c7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b9ec3b2393cd85b7a3d59fb38b871c914655e3c7/0_0_5760_3840/1000.jpg\" alt=\"David Farrier delves into the tickling fetish\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">David Farrier (left) delves into the tickling fetish.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: A Ticklish Tale Limited</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Tickled is Farrier\u2019s first foray into documentary. In the kindest possible way, it shows. As though for fear of having too little to show, he is over-reliant on telling (\u201cI have simply no idea what to expect,\u201d he says via voiceover at a pivotal moment) and his representation of Jane O\u2019Brien Media as \u201cbullies with way too much money\u201d seems a naive characterisation.</p> <p>But this has next to no negative impact on the viewer\u2019s experience. The documentary may be flawed, but the journalism is excellent \u2013 helped along, as most journalism is, by a few strokes of luck \u2013 and the story is exclaim-aloud, hand-on-mouth remarkable.</p> <p>As <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/mar/08/tickled-documentary-review-david-farrier-cyberbullying\">the Guardian\u2019s Nigel Smith wrote of</a> its premiere at Sundance, \u201cthe revelations ... are too juicy to spoil \u2013 the pleasure in watching this documentary is derived from its countless twists\u201d. And no one was more surprised by what he found than Farrier.</p> <p>\u201cWe couldn\u2019t have anticipated where it would go,\u201d he says. \u201cI mean, the scale of it kind of blew our minds \u2013 it still blows my mind. As we went, things just kept on getting bigger and bigger and bigger \u2013 and it\u2019s all about tickling, which seems so utterly bizarre.\u201d</p> <p>For him, the story is still unfolding. Jane O\u2019Brien Media has had what Farrier terms a \u201cvery Scientology response\u201d to the film; Kevin Clarke, one of the three employees that were sent to New Zealand, <a href=\"http://www.tickledmovie.info/2016/04/who-am-i/\">has set up a website to counter</a> Farrier\u2019s allegations, calling him a \u201cworld class liar\u201d and referring to his \u201cLiarmentary\u201d.</p> <p>Clarke attended both Sundance and the True/False Film Fest in Missouri in March, where Farrier was served with papers for a defamation lawsuit. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/davidfarrier/status/706308164380200964\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">thought this lady was a fan:<br>&quot;are you david?&quot; <br>i said &quot;yes&quot; hopefully...<br>&amp; then she served me.<br>this is a first. <a href=\"https://t.co/eO4UMWEoXA\">pic.twitter.com/eO4UMWEoXA</a></p>&mdash; David Farrier (@davidfarrier) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/davidfarrier/status/706308164380200964\">March 6, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>At the same event, Farrier says police ejected two audience members understood to have been attempting to record the film with a camera or microphone hidden in a coffee cup; police later told Farrier they were private investigators from New York.</p> <p>I remind Farrier that he employed the same strategy in Tickled to record a conversation with Clarke in Auckland (under New Zealand law, only one party\u2019s consent is required). He laughs: \u201cI think that was coincidental.\u201d</p> <p>Two lawyers worked pro bono to stave off the legal threats that hounded Tickled throughout its production, and more were hired after its release. David D\u2019amato, a central figure in the film who says he has no relationship with Jane O\u2019Brien Media, has filed two defamation suits against Reeve and Farrier; both were dismissed on jurisdictional grounds, but he has threatened further action. </p> <p>D\u2019amato and Clarke voiced their grievances at the Los Angeles premiere of Tickled in June \u2013 shock appearances described by New Zealand media as equivalent to watching Blackfish at the cinema \u201conly to discover either uniformed Sea World reps or the orca sitting next to you\u201d.</p> <p>The pair derailed the question and answer session after the screening in a bizarre episode that was <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/MagnoliaPictures/videos/10154133024155985/\">broadcast live on the Facebook page</a> of Magnolia Pictures, the distributor of the film in North America.</p> <p>\u201cAs we say in New York, Los Angeles TV: \u2018You need to lawyer up,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/davidfarrierjournalist/posts/1191113287597887\">warned D\u2019Amato, adding</a>: \u201cI do have to credit you, that while your facts are very discordant, some of the effects in the movie \u2013 the music, the choreography \u2013 it was done very well.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/davidfarrier/status/744033517370216448\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">david d&#39;amato has left the LA evening premiere of TICKLED at the nuart (photos via <a href=\"https://twitter.com/dylanbland\">@dylanbland</a>) <a href=\"https://t.co/u16cR7ViLc\">pic.twitter.com/u16cR7ViLc</a></p>&mdash; David Farrier (@davidfarrier) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/davidfarrier/status/744033517370216448\">June 18, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>Farrier seems remarkably relaxed about all the \u201ccraziness\u201d that\u2019s happened since the film\u2019s release. Partly it\u2019s self-preservation, partly it\u2019s familiarity: \u201cIt\u2019s been going on for so long you sort of get used to it, I suppose.\u201d</p> <p>It did take a while to get into that mindset, though. \u201cYou don\u2019t sue people in New Zealand and Australia unless you\u2019re involved in some insane big business situation. You don\u2019t have individuals suing willy-nilly. </p> <p>\u201cHopefully people watch this and do go, \u2018Oh god\u2019. The legal system is pretty fucked up over there.\u201d</p> <p>Of all the stories told by Tickled, at its heart it is a film about privilege: the people who don\u2019t have it, and the corners they can find themselves backed into \u2013 and the people who do, and the escape routes it presents them with.</p> <p>\u201cIf you\u2019ve got money in America, that does protect you in a huge way,\u201d says Farrier. \u201cAll the young men who are drawn into this tickling competition, they don\u2019t have money \u2026 And that\u2019s where it becomes problematic later.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8e11c59cb6446680da3b785798b7a5ab2671416d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8e11c59cb6446680da3b785798b7a5ab2671416d/100_0_1799_1080/1000.jpg\" alt=\"David Farrier welcomes Jane O\u2019Brien Media at Auckland International airport\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">David Farrier welcomes Jane O\u2019Brien Media at Auckland International airport.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: A Ticklish Tale Limited</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>During the film\u2019s production, Farrier left a \u201cvery long, rambling voicemail\u201d with the FBI about what he\u2019d uncovered, but did not hear back. </p> <p>\u201cI want people to leave the film feeling \u2026 that something\u2019s not right \u2026 Things need to be put right in some way, however that ends up happening \u2013 I have no idea,\u201d he says.</p> <p>\u201cTwenty-one years of this \u2013 that\u2019s fucking nuts.\u201d</p> <p>For now, Farrier draws pragmatic satisfaction from the fact that the film at least exists as a counter-narrative to that given by Jane O\u2019Brien Media.</p> <p>\u201cIt seemed the best thing to do was to make a film \u2026 put it out there, get eyes on it,\u201d he says. \u201cSo at the very least, if people want to go and do this tickling competition, they\u2019ll Google it and find \u2026 the other side of that particular story.</p> <p>\u201cAt the very least, there\u2019s that.\u201d </p> <p><em>\u2022 Tickled is in cinemas around the UK, the US and Australia</em></p>",
  "<blockquote> <p><em>My first ever laptop was a MacBook Air. However, the logic board stopped working, and Apple was going to charge $600 to fix it. Technicians have told me it is not worth fixing.</em></p> <p><em>At this point in time I cannot afford to buy a new MacBook, so which PC laptop would you recommend? I am a third year social work student, and I won\u2019t really be carrying it to class: it will mostly be used at home. I don\u2019t run any special applications, and my budget is less than $1,000.</em> <strong>Esther</strong></p> </blockquote> <p>If you have $1,000 to spend, then you can probably get a new 11in MacBook Air for $899 or a 13in MacBook Air for $999. You could even get a $1,099 13in MacBook Pro for less, if you look for discount offers on Amazon or at a local store. Or you could get a Mac Mini and add your own keyboard and screen for less than $1,000, though you would lose the portability of a laptop.</p> <p>First, check with your university or college to see if you qualify for any educational discounts on Apple products. Next, look at refurbished and second-hand models. These tend to be expensive \u2013 Macs hold their value well \u2013 but you may get some of that back if you eBay your broken MacBook Air for \u201cspares or repair\u201d.</p> <p>While you can afford $899 for an 11in MacBook Air, that\u2019s the minimum price. Expanding the memory to the recommended 8GB adds $100, while three years of Apple Care support would add another $249, bringing the total to $1,248. For this price, you could buy five low-end Windows laptops and not worry about them breaking.</p> <p>However, this not a particularly good time to buy a Mac, because the current line-up is rather old and, despite last year\u2019s refreshes, needs updating. The 13in MacBook Pro, mentioned above, hasn\u2019t been redesigned since 2012, and the Mac mini design dates from 2010. The 11in MacBook Air still has a resolution of 1366 x 768 pixels, with Mac fans waiting for Apple Retina screens. Except for the overpriced ($1,299) MacBook, the <a href=\"http://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Mac\">MacRumors Buyer\u2019s Guide</a> rates them all \u201cDon\u2019t Buy\u201d.</p> <p>The shortage of new models seems to have depressed Mac sales in the USA, but you can expect an upsurge when Apple rolls out some new ones, or just refreshes the old ones. After that, you may be able to pick up an older MacBook for less.</p> <p><strong>Pro vs Air</strong></p> <p>The MacBook Air is aimed at people who need portability, and its performance is compromised. If you don\u2019t need the portability, then I\u2019d generally recommend a MacBook Pro instead. And while the cheapest non-Retina 13in MacBook Pro can justifiably be dismissed for being <a href=\"http://www.theverge.com/2016/8/4/12373776/2012-macbook-pro-still-alive-not-dead-why\">overpriced and out of date</a>, it does have some advantages. It\u2019s the only surviving MacBook where you can easily replace the memory, the battery and the hard drive, and I think it\u2019s the only one that still has a proper Ethernet port, Firewire, and a built-in DVD drive.</p> <p>With a 13in MacBook Pro, you can upgrade the memory for very little cost. You can swap the DVD drive for an SSD (solid-state disk), and replace the battery and the logic board if they fail. Of course, if you can\u2019t do those things yourself, a repair shop will do the job, and you won\u2019t be wholly dependent on Apple.</p> <p>The 13in MacBook Pro\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.ifixit.com/Device/MacBook_Pro_13%22_Unibody_Mid_2012\">reparability</a> means it could outlast today\u2019s soldered down, sealed-box designs.</p> <p>As you have only used a Mac, I\u2019d urge you to stick with Mac if possible: people generally like what they know. Even if, one day, you came to prefer Windows 10, you would still have had to learn new ways do lots of things.</p> <p><strong>Windows alternatives</strong></p> <p>There are two obvious approaches. The first would be to buy a very cheap Windows laptop to tide you over. In this case, your long-term aim would be to buy another Mac when new models appear and/or your finances improve. The second would be to buy a more powerful Windows laptop to use for several years.</p> <p>Very cheap Windows laptops tend to have Intel Atom Z3735F or similar Pentium/Celeron processors, 2GB of memory, and 32GB eMMC flash drives (roughly the equivalent of an SD card, not an SSD). An example is the Lenovo IdeaPad 100S with an 11.6in screen, available from Amazon.com for <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0167W1VAM/\">$149.65</a>. Alternatives include the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/ASUS-X205TA-11-6-Laptop-Intel/dp/B00NY29UIO/\">Asus EeeBook X205TA</a>, which I\u2019ve seen as low as $140, and the HP Stream 11, which you can get for around $179 from Wal-Mart etc. There\u2019s also an <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B015CQ8PNA/\">HP Stream 13</a> with a 13.3in screen.</p> <p>These 2GB laptops are the modern equivalent of netbooks, designed for casual use. They are much less powerful than your MacBook Air, but they can still run Microsoft Office \u2013 which you should be able to get free, as a student \u2013 and handle web browsing and email. Although they are short of storage space, you can add a 32GB or 64GB SD card, and you can save files to a cloud drive. Microsoft OneDrive access is built in, but you can use Apple\u2019s iCloud, if you already have that.</p> <p>For a little more money, you could get a Windows 10 detachable or two-in-one with a touch-sensitive screen. These work as both laptops and tablets, running tablet apps downloaded from the Windows Store. I like the <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Asus-T100Chi-B1-BK-WX-Transformer-Touchscreen/dp/B01E7N7ZBC/\">Asus T100Chi</a> as it\u2019s better made than most similar machines and has a \u201cFull HD\u201d touchscreen (1920 x 1200 pixels) for $188.24. The <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.amazon.com/HP-X360-11-6-inch-Touch-Screen-Convertible/dp/B017PGNECW/\">HP Stream X360</a> is an alternative at $262.92.</p> <p>If you shop around, you can find plenty of similar machines from Asus, HP and Lenovo with 11.6in, 13.3in, 14in and 15.6in screens. The \u201cbest buy\u201d may be whatever\u2019s on special offer this week.</p> <p><strong>Windows 10 laptops</strong></p> <p>\u201cProper\u201d Windows laptops have at least 4GB of memory (which is fine for Windows 10), faster Intel Core processors, and either an SSD or a traditional 500GB or 1TB hard drive. These will perform more like your MacBook Air. They will run several programs at once, and support many more browser tabs without slowing down.</p> <p>They are also, of course, more expensive, but you will have to balance the price difference. For example, the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/ZenBook-UX305UA-13-3-Inch-Generation-Titanium/dp/B01BMERZJ6/\">Asus Zenbook UX305UA</a> (or CA) is arguably a better laptop than the MacBook Air: you get a newer, better processor (2.3GHz Core i5-6200U), a better screen with touch sensitivity, 8GB and a 256GB SSD for around $750, where the 13in MacBook Air costs $1,119. But if you\u2019re paying $750, you\u2019re not far off the price of a low-end Mac.</p> <p>A compromise might be something like a <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Lenovo-Yoga-710-11-Pentium/dp/B01HAQFSLM/\">Lenovo Yoga 710</a> with 11.6in Full HD screen, 4GB of memory and 128GB SSD for $499. There are lots of versions of the Yoga 700 and HP Pavilion 13 around, and you can often pick up bargains.</p> <p>If you are willing to move up to a less-portable 15.6in screen, the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Asus-Laptop-i3-5020U-Windows-Gradient/dp/B0181OV6JA/\">Asus X555LA</a> is good value and looks quite MacBook-like. You get an Intel Core i3-5020U processor, 4GB of memory (expandable), a 1TB Hard Drive and DVD for $315.36. Again, there are several other models with slightly different specifications.</p> <p>None of these laptops is as well made as a MacBook, and the trackpads and keyboards are rarely more than average, and they don\u2019t run macOS. However, when at home, you can raise the screen to an ergonomic height and use them with an external USB keyboard and mouse. In practical terms, they\u2019ll do the same job for a fraction of the price.</p> <p><strong>Have you got another question for Jack?

  "<p>Ice scientists are mostly cheerful and pragmatic. Like many other researchers coolly observing the rapid warming of the world, they share a gallows humour and are cautious about entering the political fray.</p> <p>Not Peter Wadhams. The former director of the Scott Polar Research Institute and professor of ocean physics at Cambridge has spent his scientific life researching the ice world, or the cryosphere, and in just 30 years has seen unimaginable change.</p> <p>When in 1970 he joined the first of what would be more than 50 polar expeditions, the Arctic sea ice covered around 8m sq km at its September minimum.

That\u2019s because it\u2019s popular to say that a meme has died once it has been reported on by the media and reproduced by the masses. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/2016/jun/08/the-month-in-memes-viral-comedy-june-2016\">Unicycling frog Dat Boi</a> has been declared dead on a number of occasions, but is still regularly referenced on social media. It echoes the age-old adolescent frustration about alternative culture being co-opted by the mainstream, and is proof that, in some quarters, the kind of memes you\u2019re into says just as much about you as your Instagram feed or your preferred Labour party faction.</p> <p>Yet mainstream culture\u2019s appropriation of memes can be a serious issue. Many memes first gain traction on <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Twitter\">Black Twitter</a> \u2013 the name given to a subset of the platform\u2019s users best known for birthing social justice movements such as Black Lives Matter. One recent trend directed by Black Twitter has been the creation of memes from 90s PBS cartoon <strong>Arthur</strong>. Stills from the show are used as shorthand for various feelings \u2013 a closeup of <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BestArthurMemes/status/759137680051625984\">Arthur\u2019s clenched fist</a>, for example, equals suppressed rage \u2013 while the different skin colours of the characters allow meme-makers to layer on jokes about racial politics, such as Arthur\u2019s sister DW silencing her white bunny friend as she utters the dubious phrase <a href=\"https://twitter.com/coolminnie16/status/758648466088169472\">\u201call lives matter\u201d</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0e7c0bac09562f18663efdac68c9ef4e93e713f8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0e7c0bac09562f18663efdac68c9ef4e93e713f8/0_0_592_458/500.jpg\" alt=\"arthur\" width=\"500\" height=\"387\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Arthur\u2019s first has become a Harambe meme.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Instagram/alexmemepage</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But when a meme like this becomes popular, the concept of Black Twitter is often erased from the conversation: in the case of Arthur, many websites wrote about the phenomenon without referencing who came up with it. And when that is viewed as part of a narrative that has seen white people endlessly appropriate black culture, it becomes about more than just who projected adult emotion on to a kids\u2019 cartoon first.</p> <p>Returning to the subject of death (this is 2016: worst year since records began, after all), you may remember hearing the story of <strong>Harambe</strong>, the 17-year-old gorilla who was killed in May after a child climbed into his enclosure in Cincinnati Zoo. Meme-makers have seized on this gorilla\u2019s death (initially on Black Instagram, as it happens), honouring the ape in social media posts with a cod-fanaticism that belies references to a number of things. Originally, the blinkered mourning of Harambe was a parody of the hysteria expressed by some social media users at the news of its shooting, yet in his afterlife, Harambe\u2019s death and the remembrance of it have been woven into multiple other narratives.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d8f051bfc05fc8a9e6f642b7803558016d169ee7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d8f051bfc05fc8a9e6f642b7803558016d169ee7/0_0_488_571/427.jpg\" alt=\"2016 has been a year characterised by great loss\" width=\"427\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">2016 has been a year characterised by great loss</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Twitter/@WORLDSTAR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>2016, for example, has seen an unprecedented number of major cultural figures pass away, leading to the media to indulge in a perpetual state of bereavement. Some memes have included Harambe in this pantheon of greats, a joke that acts as a sort of release valve from the pressure of constant mourning. At the same time, Harambe also represents stubborn remembrance in a world of rolling atrocity news \u2013 don\u2019t forget it\u2019s been four months since he died, roughly 10,000 years in meme-time \u2013 and part of the joke is trying to make anything and everything a tribute to him, countering the compulsive forgetting that the media usually practises. (See, for instance, the defaced <a href=\"http://www.standard.co.uk/showbiz/celebrity-news/taylor-swift-mock-memorial-defaced-with-harambe-the-gorilla-epitaph-a3300936.html\">Taylor Swift mural</a> that commemorated the singer\u2019s \u201cdeath\u201d after losing a spat with Kim and Kanye, and some US teens <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeed.com/davidmack/rip-harambe-the-gorilla-who-died\">tricking Google</a> into renaming a street Harambe Drive.) </p> <p>These callbacks are a standard meme mechanism, but what\u2019s different about Harambe is how much importance he has been imbued with over time. As of August 2016, Harambe is widely regarded to be of cosmic significance, his death half an opening of a Pandora\u2019s box of 21st-century ills, half a martyrdom of saint-like proportions.

In the two weeks after my first cycle of treatment, my weight dropped by 6kg to 54kg. I was never particularly muscular, but my arms and legs are almost stick-like now; my ribs show through my skin more than ever. In the wards I share with other men, this weight loss has led to many of them looking nearly androgynous. My university work and writing doesn\u2019t require physical strength, but for the builders and labourers with cancer, the illness can be a wrench not just to their livelihood, but to their identity.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"071409a5b64392390ab753ab0f70b4cf7ad2a52c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/071409a5b64392390ab753ab0f70b4cf7ad2a52c/0_39_750_938/400.jpg\" alt=\"Dean Eastmond and Adam Packer\" width=\"400\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dean Eastmond and Adam Packer. \u2018\u2018Being a man\u2019 translates into not visibly caring about your emotions.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Adam Packer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Accepting that you look like someone with cancer is a jolt \u2013 just as difficult as accepting that you are a person living with cancer. I have become someone I don\u2019t recognise so readily when I catch myself in the mirror late at night, I feel like a lesser version of myself; incomplete. And the problem is that because \u201cbeing a man\u201d so often translates into not visibly caring about or acknowledging your emotions, my sense of masculinity feels fractured and fragile.</p> <p>The loss of independence that comes with cancer \u2013 from the struggle not just to keep afloat financially but to pour a glass of water \u2013 is incredibly frustrating. I\u2019m halfway through my degree and was pulling together a happy life in a big city away from home. Being grounded at my family home for the duration of treatment feels like the toughest tablet to swallow. Despite my family\u2019s endless efforts to ensure I\u2019m safe, comfortable and as happy as possible, not being able to be responsible for my own wellbeing or even able to take my medication on time without help has stripped away my sense of self control. My parents\u2019 lives revolve around me now, which makes me feel both guilty and grateful.</p> <p>My treatment will most likely leave me infertile, and as a gay 20-year-old, I hadn\u2019t thought too much about my desire to have children just yet, so this news is a little unsettling. I\u2019ve long understood that I\u2019ll never procreate in a typical heterosexual relationship, but the sense of being \u201cincomplete\u201d because you\u2019re unable to procreate in the usual way is something a lot of patients talk about. I spent some time discussing infertility with a Muslim patient who was on my ward and, to him, losing the ability to procreate has disrupted his expected family plans, and makes him feel he\u2019s letting his parents down. Another patient I spoke to was concerned about what future girlfriends would say about his manhood.</p> <p>Cancer has made me rethink what masculinity means to me and others, and I\u2019ve had to adapt to suit this temporary identity. I am less independent, but more driven than ever. While cancer seems to change and compromise the identity of many men, what really needs to change is our understanding of what it means to be a \u201creal man\u201d.</p>",

Only a radical interpretation will enable it to escape the shadow of its source material. And there is another hurdle to overcome: while the movie was about repetition, the play is an example of it. </p> <p>Deviations from the screen version are minor. Though this is a musical, written by Danny Rubin (who co-wrote the screenplay with the film\u2019s director, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/feb/25/harold-ramis\">the late Harold Ramis</a>) and with songs by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2016/apr/01/tim-minchin-on-his-musical-groundhog-day-and-george-pells-moral-obligation\">Tim Minchin</a>, it has no place for Sonny &amp; Cher\u2019s \u201cI Got You, Babe\u201d, the one song that featured prominently in the film. But many of the wisecracks, including that \u201cdeja vu\u201d line, will be known to the audience before the words leave the actors\u2019 lips.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2016/aug/16/groundhog-day-review-tim-minchin-musical-old-vic\">Groundhog Day review \u2013 Tim Minchin's musical is fantastically witty</a> </p> </aside>  <p>No play looking to break free of its cinematic origins should kick off with a filmed segment, but that\u2019s precisely what Groundhog Day does. Some of the dialogue is also unchanged, though the tone of the show is necessarily different. Ramis shot the film in a straightforward fashion which made its outlandish premise seem even weirder. Matthew Warchus\u2019s production, however, is all pizzazz. Musical theatre has to be. It\u2019s hard to be deadpan when the action needs to be paused so that characters can belt out showstoppers about their thwarted dreams.<br></p> <p>Even allowing for that trade-off, it\u2019s disappointing that unforced moments from the film are now underlined, italicised and reprinted in 40ft neon. A single throwaway line from the movie, in which a barfly admits to Phil that his own life resembles an endless succession of identical days, has become a five-minute number in which that same drunk croons about how no one cares what he says.<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"6dff6e4027e7ad794cc9ca262bc40fedc2458eef\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6dff6e4027e7ad794cc9ca262bc40fedc2458eef/84_0_1618_1618/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Groundhog Day\u2019s original Ned Ryerson\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Groundhog Day\u2019s original Ned Ryerson (Stephen Tobolowsky)</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/Columbia/Sportsphoto Ltd/Allstar</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Unexpectedly, it\u2019s easy to put aside our memories of Murray. Where he played the character as a defeated sleazeball, Andy Karl turns him into an arrogant jock. His snappy performance, which has some of the self-satisfied smarm of Jason Bateman, helps the show forge its own identity, as does Carlyss Peer as Rita, Phil\u2019s producer. Rita is one of the beneficiaries of the musical format, which gives her room to reveal in song emotions that would have no other place in the story. <br></p> <p>That goes double for Nancy, a minor character who gets a solo at the start of Act Two (\u201cPlaying Nancy\u201d) in which she challenges her own slender role in the narrative. In the film, Nancy had one purpose: to be tricked into bed by Phil. But now, as played by Georgina Hagen, she sings knowingly about being \u201cthe perky-breasted giggly one\u201d and wonders if she is \u201cdestined to be a detour on the journey of some man\u201d. Not that this sort of retroactive backstory always works. The revelation that the unctuous insurance salesman Ned Ryerson is a heartbroken widower snuffs out the comedy in a character who was hilarious precisely because he was so uncomplicatedly repulsive. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6856d6b1f714c9cd8644ccf9b8a88e99976004b9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6856d6b1f714c9cd8644ccf9b8a88e99976004b9/0_183_5229_3137/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ned Ryerson (Andrew Langtree) in Groundhog Day at The Old Vic.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Unctuous insurance salesman Ned Ryerson (Andrew Langtree) in Groundhog Day at The Old Vic.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Manuel Harlan</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>For long periods, most of the company\u2019s energies seem to go into wheeling over-fussy sets on and off the stage.

One need only look at the opening night audience to see how influential the film has been: among the attendees were Edgar Wright (Hot Fuzz), whose whip-crack editing owes a thing or two to Ramis\u2019s film; Joss Whedon, whose Buffy the Vampire Slayer referenced it; and Richard Curtis, who tried and failed to make his own version with About Time. </p> <p>Rubin and Minchin have written a bigger, broader Groundhog Day.

After voting last year in favour of cutting tax credits for the poor, the creative team decide to stage the finale as a battle between the country club elite and the penniless caddies in which the latter are beaten into submission. Ballads include You Took Me Out of the Bunker (And Onto the Green) and Number 3 Iron (But Number 1 In My Heart). The animatronic gopher, from the team behind War Horse, and the lavish turd-in-the-pool set-piece, are highlights.</p> <p><strong>Stripes <br></strong>The team behind Black Watch bring Murray\u2019s coarse 1981 army comedy to the stage, importing actual mud from battlefields around the world for use in the naked mud-wrestling sequence.</p> <p><strong>Lost in Translation <br></strong>Murray was Oscar-nominated for his role as an actor holed up in a plush Tokyo hotel in Sofia Coppola\u2019s tentative 2003 love story, with Scarlett Johansson as the lonely young woman who befriends him. Mark Rylance and Carey Mulligan take the leads in this David Hare adaptation, which displays complete fidelity to the original in its utter absence of incident and a final exchange between the almost-lovers that is inaudible to the human ear. In an initiative to make theatre affordable for the masses, this hotel-set play is a site specific work performed in Premier Inns around the country. Ticket price includes breakfast buffet</p>",

The method involved asking girls to lift their breast and boys to lift their genitals prior to squatting.</p> <p>A 2013 report by the inspectorate criticised the \u201chumiliating\u201d treatment of a boy aged 17 who was on high suicide alert after attempting to take his own life five days earlier.</p> <p>While refusing a staff directive to go to his room and have a shower, he did not appear to be abusive verbally or physically, the report said.</p> <p>The boy was forced to the floor and held face-down by five staff, who cuffed both his hands behind his back and his ankles, the latter contrary to policy<strong> </strong>that ankle cuffs<strong> </strong>should only be applied during escorts to outside emergency medical facilities.</p> <p>Staff then cut through his clothing with a knife, leaving him naked on the floor before he was taken to an isolation cell for more than an hour.</p> <p>A manager had said the boy was \u201cextremely aggressive\u201d.</p> <p>But the Youth Detention Inspectorate report said the forced applied was potentially unlawful.</p> <p>\u201cThis type of practice is humiliating and has the potential to cause emotional, psychological as well as physical harm to the young person,\u201d it said.</p> <p>Roxanne Moore, an Indigenous rights campaigner for Amnesty International, said that \u201cdespite the brutal nature of this event, it was not reported as an \u2018incident of concern\u2019,\u201d and there was no immediate internal review because the child himself did not make a complaint. </p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-08-18/images-of-alleged-mistreatment-cleveland-youth-detention-centre/7758204\">ABC reported</a> that the detention centre never conducted an investigation of the incident as requested by the inspectorate, citing a lack of staff.</p> <p>The inspectorate in 2015 raised concerns about the \u201cconcerning\u201d use of guard dogs by private security in youth detention, citing the case of three Indigenous girls who had run from staff and jumped into a pool at the Cleveland centre.</p> <p>When one girl went to leave the pool, a guard allowed the dog to approach her \u201cin what would be perceived an aggressive manner and stopped her from withdrawing from the swimming pool\u201d.</p> <p>The dog reared on its hind legs and barked at her, while at least eight staff watched on.</p> <p>\u201cThis type of response is concerning as the security officers have no legal authority to physically touch or restrain a young person who is in the legal custody of the department,\u201d the report said. </p> <p>\u201cThere is also a real risk that such security strategies have an adverse effect on staff efforts to build rapport with the children.\u201d</p> <p>Moore said the revelations showed Australia urgently needed \u201can independent investigator for all places of detention\u201d.</p> <p>Queensland needed \u201ca more humane and preventative justice system, focused on rehabilitating vulnerable children, rather than further traumatising them,\u201d she said.</p> <p>\u201cIt shouldn\u2019t take the probing of an international human rights organisation for the public to hear about terrible abuses suffered by children in detention.</p> <p>\u201cThis culture of secrecy has existed for many years, through successive governments.

R\u00f6yksopp? Earlier this week, he finally revealed a few items from his current motivational playlist, including Promises by Nero and Skrillex and No Beef by Afrojack and Steve Aoki. That aggressive combination of jabbing synths and pounding kick drum is pretty standard for Phelps; in the past, he has dropped names such as Young Jeezy, Eminem and Lil Wayne. But while Phelps\u2019s teammate Ryan Lochte is reported to get similarly fired up by Lil Wayne\u2019s rhetoric in The Sky Is the Limit (\u201cCos the sky is the limit / The sky is the limit / And if you look high, you see that I\u2019m gonna be in it\u201d), the collective playlist of 2016\u2019s Olympians is a more multi-dimensional musical beast.

  "<p>British society hands out golden tickets to the privileged. These tickets secure the lucky few, born into certain select families, disproportionate power and influence for the rest of their lives. Growing up in a comfortable home with space to study; always having a satisfied stomach; being exposed to a wide range of books and a broad vocabulary from an early age; all these factors help guarantee academic success.</p> <p>A private education can inject extra confidence; family connections and contacts can open the door to desirable professions. Expensive postgraduate qualifications \u2013 increasingly necessary for certain careers \u2013 can be paid for by parents with the disposable income to do so. Working for free in unpaid internships \u2013 another ever more crucial passport into elite jobs \u2013 is a financial non-starter for many, but not for those whose parents have healthy bank balances. The housing crisis can be bypassed with a generous bank transfer from Mum and Dad, either helping with the rent or putting down the deposit.</p> <p>No wonder, then, that British elites are so&#xa0;utterly unrepresentative of the wider population. Private schools educate only 7% of Britons. And yet, according to research by the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/feb/24/privately-educated-elite-continues-to-take-top-jobs-finds-survey\" title=\"\">Sutton Trust</a> this year, private school alumni make up nearly three quarters of the top judiciary, over two-thirds of Oscar winners, six out of 10 top doctors, over half of the top journalists, and almost a third of MPs.</p> <p>Unless you really believe \u201cthe most talented\u201d and \u201cthe most privileged\u201d are synonymous, this is manifestly unjust. Only a programme of social transformation can address such inequality \u2013 from tackling the housing crisis to increasing investment in early-years education to a war on poverty.</p> <p>This government, on the other hand, has opted for tinkering. The Tory Cabinet Office minister Ben Gummer (himself the privately educated son of a&#xa0;Tory cabinet minister) proposes to ask all civil service applicants <a href=\"http://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/job-applicants-to-be-asked-if-they-are-from-middle-classes-qqrsmffdm\" title=\"\">12 questions</a>. Their purpose: to assess where they stand in the social pecking order. The questions are certainly eclectic, ranging from whether they spent time in care or previously held refugee or asylum status, to what school they went to, whether they were eligible for free school meals, and what their postcode was at the age of 14. And then the question guaranteed to cause squirming \u2013 how the applicant would assess their own socio-economic background.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b01c66a7a9d05939897ddaa761d7353407de74f2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b01c66a7a9d05939897ddaa761d7353407de74f2/0_25_4000_2400/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Call centre\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018The shift from a working class of mines, steelworks and factories to one of supermarkets, call centres and offices confused things, but merely discussing class is often regarded as subversive.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bloomberg via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Such efforts are not worthless: they may provide a small boost to efforts to make elite professions more diverse, and at least foster debate about our class-ridden \u2013 indeed, class-defined \u2013 society. Sure, the shift from a working class of mines, steelworks and factories to one of supermarkets, call centres and offices confused things, but merely discussing class is often regarded as subversive: after all, it not only makes us confront the issue of who has wealth and power, it also encourages us to ask why.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Questioning class privilege in elite circles can be construed as a personal attack</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>And then there\u2019s the insecurity of the elite. Everyone likes to believe their success is down to their own talent, hard work and determination. Questioning class privilege in elite circles can be construed as a personal attack: \u201cYou\u2019re saying I\u2019m only here because I was born with a silver spoon in my mouth!\u201d (Cards on the table: I do not believe I would be writing for this paper if, like people I grew up with, I spent my childhood on a Stockport council estate.)</p> <p>Discussions about class suffer from a lack of precision. For example, the&#xa0;educational attainment of working-class white pupils is often discussed, but&#xa0;the statistics actually relate to \u201cwhite pupils who are eligible for free school meals\u201d. Only around 14% of pupils claim them, so \u201cworking class\u201d simply becomes synonymous with the poorest families in society.</p> <p>But the working class has always included a broad variety of experiences: homeowners and social housing tenants, full-time and part-time, women&#xa0;and men, British-born and migrant, black and white, public and private sector, urban and rural, English and Scottish, and so on. Such differences often become divisions that&#xa0;are ruthlessly and effectively exploited, turning neighbour against neighbour, rather than directing anger at&#xa0;the powerful.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/14/courageous-thinking-labour-education-jeremy-corbyn\">At last, courageous thinking from Labour on education | Zoe Williams</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The left desperately needs to refocus on class. From the 1980s onwards \u2013 as the Labour movement was crushed, old industries smashed and the cold war ended \u2013 class took the back seat. Gender, race and sexuality seemed more salient and relevant. In truth, it should never have been either/or: how can you understand gender without class and vice versa given, say, the disproportionate concentration of women in low-paid and insecure work?</p> <p>But this era left many working-class people feeling that not only did the left no longer care about them \u2013 worse, that these issues had become sticks to beat them with. Many felt insulted and written off as a bigoted, backward, knuckle-dragging mob, only happy when launching an expletive-ridden diatribe about a minority.</p> <p>The abandonment of class since the 90s has had profound consequences for this country. As in the&#xa0;United States, the populist right saw a vacuum and they occupied it: they&#xa0;adopted the language of class, spoke of how the metropolitan liberal set had nothing but contempt for working-class Britain, and championed working-class interests \u2013 not against bosses and bankers, but rather immigrants and benefit cheats.</p> <p>And lo, a working-class revolt finally came, and it was Brexit. Let\u2019s not generalise: millions of working-class people did vote to remain, particularly those from ethnic minorities or who were younger. But while a large majority of middle-class professionals voted for the EU, a decisive majority of working-class people opted to leave. Ukip chipped into&#xa0;a Labour working-class base that felt maligned and demonised.</p> <p>While Labour descends into a mire of&#xa0;introversion and internecine conflict, Theresa May is cleverly raiding the old language of the left. Her government will only further entrench the concentration of wealth and power in very few hands. But with so much of working-class Britain feeling culturally alienated from the left, that hardly matters.</p> <p>A new rightwing majority could be forged by a swath of working-class Britain who feel the left inhabits a parallel universe. It\u2019s time for the left to&#xa0;return to class \u2013 or an eternity of Tory governments beckons.</p>",

But section 18D provides exemptions for \u201cany genuine academic, artistic or scientific purpose or any other genuine purpose in the public interest\u201d.</p> <p>Sackville says while there are \u201cpowerful policy reasons\u201d for keeping hate speech laws, amendments could create a \u201cmore defensible balance between the legitimate protection of vulnerable groups from serious hate speech and the values of free speech\u201d. </p> <p>\u201cAn objective test would involve reference to the standards of a reasonable member of the community at large,\u201d he said.<br></p> <p>\u201cIn practice, as in so many areas of the law, this would involve courts exercising judgment in the light of their assessment of prevailing community standards, taking account of the evidence adduced in the individual case.\u201d</p> <p>The Liberal senator James Paterson joined Bernardi to argue the case for change. Asked why it was necessary to give people the legal right to insult or offend people on the basis of race, Paterson said a number of court cases \u2013 including the case relating to Andrew Bolt \u2013 showed free expression was curtailed by 18C. </p> <p>\u201cIn some ways a more troubling case ... is a case currently before the courts from the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/jun/14/facebook-to-be-subpoenaed-in-queensland-racial-discrimination-case\">Queensland University of Technology</a> where some students essentially engaged in a bit of <a href=\"http://resources.news.com.au/files/2016/02/03/1227734/675188-160204qut.pdf\">letting off steam on social media</a> and we have now had up to a three year process of investigation,\u201d Paterson told Sky. </p>",

</aside>  <p>A surge in complaints during every local government election campaign since 2004 has prompted questions about politically motivated abuse of the CCC\u2019s corruption complaints system.</p> <p>The CCC issued a <a href=\"http://www.ccc.qld.gov.au/research-and-publications/publications/ccc/publishing-allegations/publicising-allegations\">discussion paper</a> titled \u201cMaking allegations of corrupt conduct public: is it in the public interest?\u201d and invited responses.</p> <p>It will hold a public forum on 7 October to \u201chelp to identify a workable solution which addresses reputational damage as well as the protection of free speech, a fair trial, and the effectiveness of the CCC\u201d.</p> <p>Media organisations have argued the public airing of corruption complaints to the CCC is instrumental to transparency and the public interest.</p> <p>The Queensland police commissioner, Ian Stewart, in one of the few other submissions backing the status quo, noted that it was a \u201ccomplex issue \u2026 however, the Queensland police service holds the view current practices are appropriate\u201d.</p> <p>This was because they allowed for transparency and there were existing laws and policy around the release of information about complaints, \u201cnotably defamation and public interest disclosure legislation\u201d, Stewart said.</p> <p>He noted that \u201cchanges may impact on the number of complaints (with complainants able to remain anonymous)\u201d and questioned the \u201cimpact of investigations and or enforcement of any breach of new legislation\u201d for police and the CCC.</p> <p>The Independent Commission Against Corruption in New South Wales \u2013 which has a history of holding many more public corruption inquiries than the CCC \u2013 said it had \u201cno recent experience\u201d of the problem of corruption complaints aired during election campaigns.</p> <p>Past concerns about politically motivated complaints appeared to have been dealt with by Icac raising the issue directly with MPs and parties in 1999, and then issuing a brochure during local government elections in 2004. </p> <p>\u201cIt does not appear from Icac records there has been a need to repeat these exercises for subsequent state or local government elections,\u201d the commissioner, Megan Latham, said.</p> <p>The LNP in its submission said similar efforts in Queensland had failed to prevent \u201crepeated abuses of the corrupt conduct complaints and notification system in the pursuit of short-term political advantage\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cTime and again persons and entities involved in the politics of Queensland have made complaints alleging corruption on the part of a political opponent for the purpose \u2026 of being able then to disseminate the fact that the complaint had been made, often without details or an analysis of its merits,\u201d it said.</p> <p>Media reporting of such cases \u201cwill usually lead to great reputational harm to the impugned person, and will often yield significant political advantage for the proponents of the complaint\u201d.</p> <p>The LNP argued changes to stop CCC complaints or investigations being publicised would not stifle public debate, as complainants could still make their allegations public, if not the fact of their complaint.</p> <p>The referral of Campbell Newman to the corruption watchdog during the 2012 state election campaign by the then premier, Anna Bligh, was a bitter bone of contention for the LNP. </p> <p>The watchdog, examining allegations about Newman\u2019s dealings while Brisbane lord mayor with an office in a building linked to his family, ruled there was no evidence of official misconduct and he went on to become premier.</p> <p>The Council for Civil Liberties said defamation laws were an expensive and time consuming remedy for targets of vexatious complaints. It supported a sanction similar to South Australia, where an individual faces a fine of up to $30,000 for breaching the confidentiality of official corruption complaints.</p> <p>The secrecy obligation is waived once the South Australian corruption watchdog finishes investigations, holds public hearings, finds sufficient evidence to charge or discipline targets of complaints, or the supreme court or the targets themselves authorise disclosure. </p> <p>The former LNP opposition leader Lawrence Springborg, in a submission as chair of the parliamentary crime and corruption committee, noted the \u201cpractical difficulties involved in enforcing an obligation of confidentiality, especially in relation to complaints made anonymously\u201d had been highlighted previously by the committee and the CCC .</p> <p>Springborg said if the proposal for binding secrecy was to be effective, changes needed to be considered to the Public Service Act and Local Government Act to put the same obligations on complainants. </p> <p>\u201cUnless this is done, the potential for abuse of the complaints system will remain,\u201d he said.</p> <p>The Queensland Law Society said publicity of corruption complaints \u201cmay result in irreversible damage to individuals\u2019 reputations if the complaints are found to be baseless or vexatious\u201d.</p> <p>Requiring confidentiality in \u201cthe assessment stage of complaints will assist in deterring baseless or politically motivated complaints\u201d, it said.</p> <p>The office of the information commissioner said \u201cin most cases\u201d complaints to CCC or their investigation \u201cshould not be disclosed [as] it may unfairly impugn a person\u2019s reputation and/or may compromise [an] investigation\u201d.</p> <p>But this secrecy would also require changes to the Right To Information Act around the notification of decisions \u201cincluding reasons [for] refusal of access to documents\u201d which would reveal investigations were under way, it said.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/apr/21/unions-say-eric-abetz-a-hypocrite-over-concerns-a-federal-icac-would-harm-reputations\">Unions say Eric Abetz a hypocrite over concerns a federal Icac would harm reputations</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Cynthia Kardell, a solicitor and national president of Whistleblowers Australia, said it would be \u201ca mistake to allow the potential for reputational damage to the subject of the allegations to constrain how the CCC operates because it would open it up to being manipulated by equally powerful players in private\u201d. </p> <p>\u201cIf the subsequent public debate wrongly tends to elevate the credibility of the complaint or the complainant, then that should not influence what the CCC does either.

The most recent inspections found no major faults but a January 2015 inspection stated that oil fuel lines should be screened or protected to avoid any spray or leakage on to ignition sources.</p> <p>Crespo said 105 people were treated at the scene, mostly for heat stroke, shock and dehydration, and 24 others had been hospitalised. Among them were three women who dislocated their ankles and a man who broke his leg while going down the emergency slide.</p> <p>On the docks several dozen people were carried in on stretchers, one of which held a man hooked to an IV line who was cradling a crying baby clad only in a diaper.<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a65b6844d65f0ee0db839a6f51725f72d55ccd7b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a65b6844d65f0ee0db839a6f51725f72d55ccd7b/0_83_4448_2670/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Smoke billows from the Caribbean Fantasy after a burst fuel line caused a fire in the engine room.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Smoke billows from the Caribbean Fantasy after a burst fuel line caused a fire in the engine room.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The injured were followed by a small group of children who held hands as they disembarked from coast guard boats.

  "<p>So you have seen the milking cows going to the abattoir and seen the footage of the dairy farmers walking off the land. There you are in the supermarket aisle, in front of the milk fridge. What to buy?</p> <p>Alex Robertson, a dairy farmer and spokesman for Farmer Power, says steer clear of the $1 milk. \u201cAt the end of the day, it\u2019s a signal to the supermarket that we don\u2019t want their plain-label dollar milk impacting the price.\u201d</p> <p>The Victorian dairy farmer Marian Macdonald has the same advice, <a href=\"https://milkmaidmarian.com/2016/06/08/what-it-means-to-me-when-you-buy-branded-milk/\">writing on her blog</a>: \u201cEvery time you reach into the supermarket fridge and choose branded over unbranded, I say a little thank you.\u201d<br></p> <p>\u201cIf milk was $100 would dairy farmers be going broke? If its a bigger pie, there\u2019s more to share.\u201d</p> <p>But a new analysis by the consumer group Choice has found that consumers have embraced the boycott of $1-a-litre milk, spending an additional $113.7m on branded milk. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/aug/18/dairy-crisis-law-could-force-milk-processors-to-change-contracts-with-farmers\">Dairy crisis: law could force milk processors to change contracts with farmers</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Since the boycott started in May \u2013 after processors imposed a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/may/18/dairy-price-drop-nationals-and-labor-grapple-with-farmer-crisis\">price cut on dairy farmers</a> \u2013 sales of $1-a-litre private-label milk by big supermarkets have dropped dramatically.</p> <p>Choice says sales of private-label milk have dropped in that time from 63.3% of sales by volume to just 50%. \u201cGiven the average retail price of branded milk is $1.92 per litre, 90% higher than private-label milk ($1.01 per litre), processors are set for a serious windfall,\u201d said Choice\u2019s Tom Godfrey.</p> <p>But Choice is concerned that the milk processors will get the windfall rather than the dairy farmers. \u201cWhile consumers have poured so much into branded milk products, processors like <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/aug/16/nick-xenophon-calls-for-free-school-milk-scheme-to-help-rescue-dairy-industry\">Murray Goulburn</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/may/17/dairy-farmers-say-sudden-milk-price-drop-leaves-them-high-and-dry\">Fonterra</a>, Lion and Parmalat have offered no guarantee that they will pass on the windfall to farmers,\u201d Godfrey said.</p> <p>Choice has called on milk processors to confirm whether they are passing on any extra funds to farmers, writing to all milk processors. \u201cConsumers are making decisions based on an assumption that they are helping Australian farmers,\u201d Godfrey said. \u201cWe want the big brands to be honest to help consumers make informed decisions in the supermarket. </p> <p>\u201cMany people are buying more expensive milk to support farmers.
