  "<p>With four matches of this Ryder Cup complete Europe\u2019s obituary was half-written. The USA, inspired by the legend of Arnold Palmer, claimed the first session of the event with a whitewash not seen since The King was captain in 1975.</p> <p>The outcome seemed written in the stars, amid a sense there was barely any merit in playing for the remaining 24 points. Further bad news for the holders, as if it was necessary, derived from the format of that morning spell: foursomes are historically an American weakness. In 2014 the USA lost the two foursomes segments 7-1. The point arrived from two halved matches. A European recovery from this position seemed as likely as PJ Willett being afforded a VIP ticket to Sunday\u2019s closing ceremony. More of his unfortunate and recurring influence later.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/oct/01/rory-mcilroy-acclaims-buoyant-european-team-ryder-cup\">Rory McIlroy acclaims \u2018buoyant\u2019 Ryder Cup team after fightback</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It transpires, wonderfully so for the dynamic of the 41st joust for the Ryder Cup, that tales of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2016/sep/30/ryder-cup-2016-usa-v-europe-day-one-foursomes-live\">Europe\u2019s demise were grossly exaggerated</a>. The Mauling of Minnesota was no more; as illustrated by the removal of roars which had reverberated around Hazeltine National for four hours.</p> <p>In an afternoon session of fourballs Darren Clarke\u2019s men staged a stirring comeback to leave the aggregate score at 5-3. Europe may be behind but they have unquestionably been afforded fresh hope just when, even so formatively, all seemed lost. Europe trail but have the momentum so absent during a wounding first few hours. In another pertinent nod to history, which Clarke would be foolish not to draw upon, the overnight scoreline is precisely the same as from Friday into Saturday at Medinah in 2012. No one will need reminding as to what happened next.</p> <p>In the foursomes wave mist gave way to blue skies and a red scoreboard. Henrik Stenson and Justin Rose, such a formidable combination at Gleneagles two years ago, were toppled 3&amp;2 by Patrick Reed and Jordan Spieth. Rory McIlroy and Andy Sullivan had been two up on Phil Mickelson and Rickie Fowler after six holes but succumbed to defeat by a hole. As the atmosphere intensified, so too did USA belief.</p> <p>Sergio Garc\u00eda and Martin Kaymer, which always looked the most questionable of Clarke\u2019s pairings, lost out 4&amp;2 to Jimmy Walker and Zach Johnson. Europe had been one up in that match when taking to the 12th tee before capitulation ensued.</p> <p>Clarke will never admit that Thomas Pieters was named as a foursomes partner to Lee Westwood because of the furore surrounding Danny Willett. One should not expect him to. And yet it is difficult not to infer precisely that that is what occurred. Pieters was pretty much blameless in the 5&amp;4 victory of Dustin Johnson and Matt Kuchar, such was the remarkably inadequate level of Westwood\u2019s play. Perhaps the 43-year-old felt intense pressure, amid the sceptical notion that his closeness to Clarke was the only reason for a wildcard pick.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2016/sep/30/ryder-cup-2016-usa-v-europe-day-one-foursomes-live\">Ryder Cup 2016: USA 5-3 Europe after day one \u2013 as it happened</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cI\u2019ll take responsibility for that,\u201d said Westwood, to his credit. \u201cI played poorly today and Thomas played well. He\u2019s got into the Ryder Cup really well. He showed some balls out there and made some putts when we needed to.\u201d</p> <p>Westwood spent the afternoon on the practice range. That was after issuing a warning: \u201cThis is only the first morning. Anything can happen in The Ryder Cup. It\u2019s freaky like that.\u201d In context of what had transpired, Westwood may as well have delivered the comment while wearing nothing but a water-shooting bow tie and a pair of clown\u2019s shoes. He might just have the last laugh.</p> <p>After a brief lunch break Europe were transformed. Rose and Stenson, facing the same opposition in game one, had a better-ball score of nine under par through 14 holes in recording a 5&amp;4 win. Stenson came within a whisker of a sensational hole in one at the 8th, which even the wildly partisan \u2013 to the point of unsportsmanlike \u2013 home crowd had to acknowledge. Spieth and Reed thereby sampled defeat for the first time in four Ryder Cup matches together.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s one thing if you\u2019re losing and you\u2019re playing badly but we were both pretty happy with our performance in the morning,\u201d said Stenson. \u201cWe missed a couple of putts and that\u2019s why we lost. We tried to get even better, we did that and made a few putts and got the point back. It makes it sweeter when you beat the guys you lost to in the morning, that\u2019s for sure.\u201d</p> <p>Garc\u00eda, now in alliance with his compatriot and the debutant Rafa Cabrera Bello, saw off JB Holmes and Ryan Moore by 3&amp;2, though not without a late scare.</p> <p>McIlroy, who seemed routinely irritated by gallery shouts, but to the point where inspiration rather than distraction was forthcoming, teamed up brilliantly with Pieters in thereby justifying Clarke\u2019s decision to leave the young Belgian on the course for consecutive rounds. Europe hauled down Dustin Johnson and Kuchar, 3&amp;2, in that final fourball match. McIlroy\u2019s demonstrative passion this week has been quite a sight, almost as if he has been freed from the shackles of standard tournament play. He sealed the match with a magnificent eagle at the 16th.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/sep/30/ryder-cup-2016-diary-michael-jordan-prince\">Ryder Cup diary: Michael Jordan makes entrance while putting punter cashes in</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The afternoon negative for Clarke resonated in heavy defeat for Willett and Kaymer. Brandt Snedeker and Brooks Koepka were a seven-under better ball for the 14 holes of their 5&amp;4 success but the week is not getting any easier for Willett after his brother\u2019s needless and earlier interventions. The Masters champion appeared in relaxed enough touch despite regular cat-calling from outside the ropes but the situation could not have been particularly easy for other members of the Willett family, who had come here to celebrate a special career moment.

  "<h2>Monday</h2> <p>The prevailing mood at the Labour party conference in Liverpool was of gloomy resignation, with right and left aware they need to unite yet not entirely certain how best to make it happen. For anything approaching fun, you had to take a 20-minute walk to a community centre where <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/momentum\">Momentum</a> was having its event, The World Transformed. There, you could find people engaging with ideas in the daytime and having a laugh and dancing in the evening. Trade was brisk \u2013 this wasn\u2019t a capitalism-free zone \u2013 and the bookshop sold out of copies of Poems for Jeremy Corbyn. My favourite was Song of the Knives-in-the-Backbenchers (sung to the tune of Gee, Officer Krupke in West Side Story). It began \u201cDear saintly Jezza Corbyn / you gotta understand / that parliaments of fawning / have left us very bland. / Our voters all drive Volvos / our agents do the same / Golly Moses, naturally we\u2019re tame!\u201d<br></p> <h2>Tuesday</h2> <p>The talking point of the first <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/27/presidential-debate-reaction-hillary-clinton-donald-trump\">US debate</a> between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump hasn\u2019t been over who won, as most people agree that Clinton cruised it. It\u2019s been over Trump\u2019s repeated sniffing, with some saying the Don had got an allergy, while Howard Dean, a doctor and former chairman of the Democratic national committee, alleged he must have taken cocaine. Trump denied this. I believe him, though he has my sympathies. Imagine what it must be like to suffer from terminal megalomania, to have a total inability to distinguish between fact and fiction even when confronted with the evidence, to know many people find you utterly unbearable, and not even have the excuse that you\u2019ve done some coke.<br></p> <h2>Wednesday</h2> <p>Finding a free table for dinner can be tricky at party conferences, but sometimes you get lucky. Passing an Indian restaurant, we noticed one unoccupied table for nine people, so asked if it was available. \u201cIt\u2019s being held for Mr<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/04/keith-vaz-to-step-down-commons-committee-chair-sunday-mirror-sex-claims\"> Keith Vaz</a>,\u201d the manager replied. We were able to explain the Labour MP wasn\u2019t going to be using his reservation as he had cancelled his annual Diversity Nite event, so we got the table. I did, though, think twice about going to the Daily Mirror party, always the hottest ticket at the conference. Having seen the length of the queue and the state of the people falling out of the front door, I opted for an early night. So I missed the fire-eater who set fire to the carpet, a Beatles tribute band that looked nothing like the Beatles, Yvette Cooper dancing rather better than her absent husband, and rival Labour factions shouting, \u201cJeremy\u201d and \u201cTony\u201d at each other.<br></p> <h2>Thursday</h2> <p>The news so many people have been dreading. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/danbrown\">Dan Brown</a> is writing a new novel called Origin featuring his world-famous symbologist, Robert Langdon. It won\u2019t be published until next year but Brown has been kind enough to offer me a preview: \u201cLangdon\u2019s mind was a vale of darkness. His eidetic memory had failed him. \u2018You\u2019ve been shot,\u2019 a woman said. He looked up to see a lissom figure with gentle brown eyes that held a profundity of experience rarely encountered in someone of her age. \u2018I\u2019m Carla Miller. A doctor. We have to get you out of here. Someone is trying to kill you.\u2019 \u2018Why would anyone want to do that?\u2019 he asked. \u2018Because they read The Da Vinci Code.\u2019 Just then, a masked woman with spiky hair burst through the doors, firing a metallic gun made of metal. Carla opened a hidden trapdoor no one had guessed might be there and she and Langdon slid down a curved tunnel that took them to a secret hideout. Langdon looked out the window. \u2018From my observations, I deduce we must be in Florence, the most populous city in Tuscany, with 370,000 residents,\u2019 he said. \u2018There\u2019s no time for you to quote Wikipedia,\u2019 Sienna reprimanded him scoldingly. \u2018The world is under threat.\u2019\u201d<br></p> <h2>Friday</h2> <p>I\u2019d probably have been more receptive to the University of Alicante\u2019s report that we all needed to go on courses to train for retirement had I not been just days away from my own 60th birthday. Right now, I couldn\u2019t feel less joyous about embracing my end-of-life experience. Still, give it a few months and maybe I will become more receptive. I can think of two courses that will be of benefit to me. The first is financial planning: I have stupidly managed to live my life arse about tit and spent most of my 20s living as a retiree, watching plenty of daytime TV in between trying not to get sacked from dead-end part-time jobs. As a result, my pension provision is pitiful. Only this week, Sun Life kindly sent me a statement saying my projected income at retirement is \u00a32,365. I\u2019m guessing, but I suspect that may not be enough. The other course I could use is health awareness. Much of the past 30 years I\u2019ve spent imagining every symptom to be fatal. Now I need help preparing for the fact that, sooner rather than later, one will be.<br></p> <p><strong>Digested week, digested:</strong> Friends Not-Entirely-Reunited<br></p>",

Rory was snoozing for much of that back nine, but look how he came to life: an eagle to seal a 3&amp;2 victory! He pointedly takes a theatrical bow to all four corners of Hazeltine, then shouts EFFING COME ON, or something like it, before chest bumping his partner with some feeling. Pieters being the best part of a foot taller than McIlroy, he nearly knocks Europe\u2019s star turn over, and looks back sheepishly to check he hasn\u2019t done exactly that.

McIlroy, the four-time major winner with three Ryder Cups already under his belt, dumped his ball in the water - and the rookie wins the hole anyway!

He was being heckled by one of his own fans before taking that shot; he had to step out of his stance a couple of times, then tell everyone to pipe down. A few cold drinks taken, perhaps.

Spieth is up first, and he makes his birdie. Pressure on Rose. Stenson, on a similar line but miles outside, goes first. He misses, but Rose goes to school on it and knocks in his birdie.

It puts awful pressure on Sergio, but he gently prods it along a similar line and into the hole. He cups his ear in the panto style, eliciting a few comedic boos from the gallery. A huge smile plays across his face. Europe remain four up, though Moore will be happy enough with the way that panned out too. Meanwhile Willett drains a monster on 9!

Sullivan meanwhile overhits a simple approach from the fairway, his ball nestling in the long stuff at the back; McIlroy hits a hot one ten feet past the hole. But Fowler can\u2019t knock in the long putt to save par, while Sullivan finally finds a little something, making Europe\u2019s par and screaming quite a lot as he squares the match. That\u2019s a real rollercoaster; just two halves in the last eight holes. What a tussle! Meanwhile back on 10, Kaymer knocks the European approach to eight feet. Jimmy Walker\u2019s long putt gives Sergio a read, but the Spanish genius fails to hit his effort. Sergio looks beyond distraught, so Kaymer ostentatiously scoops up the ball and skips off, a show designed to inject some energy back into his crestfallen partner.

He needed to make it, too, because Reed had clipped a delightful chip to six feet, and Spieth\u2019s not missing that birdie chance. The US are off to a flyer in the opening match!

Rose might be forced to consider some overhanging branches from a nearby tree, so lobbing it up might be out. Reed will find himself a little further up. Back on 2, both teams find the green in regulation, and face uphill putts from 20-odd feet. And on 1, Sergio, Martin Kaymer, Jimmy Walker and Zach Johnson take to the tee. Kaymer finds sand down the right with his drive; Sergio can only advance it into the bunker front-left of the green. Zach Johnson splits the fairway meanwhile, but Walker inexplicably pulls his into the bunker back-left of the putting surface. An opportunity to turn an early screw spurned.

It\u2019s conceded, after which Spieth rolls his short birdie effort straight at the hole. He\u2019s after it, putter in the air, before the ball even drops into the centre of the cup. The US go ahead in the opening match! Back on the 1st green, Fowler seriously underhits his putt coming up the green, leaving Phil with a nervy five-footer. Sullivan looks as though he\u2019s drained his to win the hole, but the ball skates off to the left with its last couple of turns. And he\u2019s hit that hard enough for Rory to be faced with a four-footer of his own coming back. Mickelson taps his in for the par; Rory makes his too, though his slippery downhill effort only just grabs enough of the right-hand side of the cup.

Spieth will have a very good look at putt which will, in all likelihood, give him the chance to put a first dash of red on the board.

It needs to be, because the cheers that greet Phil and Rickie practically scatter the mist. Andy Sullivan, nervelessly, batters Europe\u2019s opening drive down the track. That\u2019ll settle him. Fowler follows. A pair of big drives there, taking out the corner on the left. Up on 2, Stenson splits the fairway; erstwhile European captain Sam Torrance looks on with a satisfied grin across his face. Spieth matches him.

It\u2019s infrequent enough, both in itself and in the format (what little team matchplay there is isn\u2019t generally constructed in such an entertaining manner) to make the event special when it comes around. It has allowed players who otherwise barely get a moment in the sun to become heroes (particularly on the European side). There have been moments of intense catharsis the likes of which I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve witnessed anywhere else in sport - I\u2019m thinking of Darren Clarke and Jose Maria Olazabal in particular. And there has been a consistent recent bias towards the team I support winning (though I suppose the Americans need to win it once in a while to make the victory mean something). It really is an event like no other and I for one cannot wait for it to get started.\u201d We\u2019ll be off in a minute.<br></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57ee58afe4b0b4439e747648\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-30T12:25:19.268Z\">1.25pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Davis Love III speaks! </strong>\u201cWe\u2019re confident.

Partly because it was the last Ryder Cup on American soil; partly because Europe\u2019s improbable comeback represents the most wounding segment of the USA\u2019s current three-time losing streak; but mainly because this year\u2019s host, Davis Love III, was on the receiving end of history that day. Thing is, though, Captain Love really shouldn\u2019t beat himself up too hard. He did very little wrong: going into the singles 10-6 up attests to that. And there was simply no accounting for what happened next. Somebody up there had Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Olaz\u00e1bal\u2019s back, that\u2019s all. You know who. It still brings a flush to the cheeks, recollecting the moment an out-of-form Martin Kaymer simply refused to buckle and made that tickly six-footer, and Olly pulled his cap over his eyes to mop up the emotion.</p> <p><strong>There are going to be a few hot tears shed this weekend, too, one way or another.</strong> Seve and Jos\u00e9 were some Ryder Cup partnership: 11 wins and two halves in 15 matches! But how about Arnold Palmer and Gardner Dickinson? Five matches, five wins! Dear me! You\u2019re not beating that. The King passed last Sunday. Whoever wins this weekend, and whatever your philosophical take on the afterlife, it\u2019d be nice to think Arnie will be at Hazeltine, somewhere, somehow, reading the line of a few 30-footers, making sure one or two crucial putts topple into the hole for the USA. Perhaps he\u2019ll instigate a trademark birdie charge here or there, too, who knows. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/video/2016/sep/30/ryder-cup-heckler-makes-putt-to-win-100-bet-video\">Perhaps he\u2019s at it already.</a></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/video/2016/sep/30/ryder-cup-heckler-makes-putt-to-win-100-bet-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/55at8\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2763404\"            data-video-name=\"Ryder Cup heckler makes putt to win $100 bet \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"SNTV\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-57ee2278e4b0c38a12e7152b\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=11733742&amp;format=video/mp4\"/><source src=\"https://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=11733742&amp;format=video/m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=11733742&amp;format=video/3gp&amp;maxwidth=700\"/><source src=\"https://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=11733742&amp;format=video/3gp&amp;minwidth=700\"/><source src=\"https://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=11733742&amp;format=video/webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/video/2016/sep/30/ryder-cup-heckler-makes-putt-to-win-100-bet-video\">Ryder Cup heckler makes putt to win $100 bet</a>.</figcaption> </figure>   <p><strong>Such a shame the great man will miss the next three days. </strong>They promise so much. Why? Because 2016 has unquestionably been one of the greatest years in golf history, that\u2019s why! Jordan Spieth\u2019s uncharacteristic collapse at the Masters, allowing Danny Willett to seize the day. Dustin Johnson shaking the major monkey off his back under unnecessary pressure from the suits at the US Open. Henrik Stenson and Phil Mickelson reprising, arguably besting, the Duel in the Sun at Troon. Jimmy Walker and Jason Day going mano-a-mano down the stretch at the PGA. Justin Rose and Henrik Stenson toe to toe in Rio. And only last weekend, Rory McIlroy flinging several kitchen sinks at the nuclear-resistant Ryan Moore before he was finally able to claim the Tour Championship and FedEx Cup. Phew <em>(x6)</em>! The Ryder Cup isn\u2019t going to let us down, is it? Not if what those lads have served up this year is any guide.</p> <p><strong>So here we go!</strong> It\u2019s on! And here\u2019s how the Titleist rolls ...</p> <p><strong>United States of America:</strong> Dustin Johnson, Jordan Spieth, Phil Mickelson, Patrick Reed, Jimmy Walker, Brooks Koepka, Brandt Snedeker, Zach Johnson, JB Holmes, Rickie Fowler, Matt Kuchar, Ryan Moore.<br> <em>Non-playing captain: Davis Love III</em></p> <p><strong>Europe: </strong>Rory McIlroy, Danny Willett, Henrik Stenson, Chris Wood, Sergio Garcia, Rafael Cabrera-Bello, Justin Rose, Andy Sullivan, Matthew Fitzpatrick, Lee Westwood, Martin Kaymer, Thomas Pieters.<br> <em>Non-playing captain: <strike> Peter Willett </strike> Darren Clarke</em></p> <p><strong>The format: </strong>The 41st Ryder Cup Matches, to use the official title, is a matchplay event. Each match is worth a point. There are 28 points available over the three days, so the first team to get to 14.5 points will win the Cup. Should the Matches be tied at 14 points apiece, Europe will retain the trophy as current holders.</p> <p><strong>Match-play explained for those dipping their toe into the murky world of golf for the first time: </strong>In common-or-garden championship golf, such as the Open or the Masters, tournaments are scored using the stroke-play system. Whoever takes the fewest shots over all four rounds in a championship wins. All shots count and are added up for a cumulative total. So if, say, in next year\u2019s Masters Rory McIlroy shoots 63-63-63-63 and Jordan Spieth shoots 87-87-87-87, Rory will have taken 252 strokes, and beaten a teary Jordan by 96 shots. You\u2019ll get good odds on this happening at Augusta National next April, if you enjoy the sound of metal on porcelain as you flush the contents of your purse down the lavvy.</p> <p><strong>Anyway, in match play, each player or team wins a hole, or a point, for every hole they better their opponents. </strong>So if Rory takes five shots at the 1st, but Jordan needs only three, Jordan goes 1up. If Jordan wins the next hole too, he\u2019s 2up. If the pair share the same number of shots on the 3rd, the hole is halved, and Jordan remains 2up. It doesn\u2019t matter if Rory took 13 shots on the 2nd, by the way; a bit like the unwritten rules of stag weekends, or visits to purse-porcelain interface venue Las Vegas, what happens on each hole stays on each hole. There is no knock-on effect.</p> <p><strong>So let\u2019s say the Texas Kid wins the first nine holes. </strong>With nine played, and nine remaining, Jordan is 9up. McIlroy can only tie at best; Jordan can\u2019t lose. This is known as dormie. (And more specifically, in this slightly ludicrous example, as dormie nine.) If Rory wins the next nine, the game will end all square, and each team will get half a point to their overall total. But if Jordan wins the 10th, he\u2019s 10up with eight holes to play. He has won 10&amp;8. If the 10th hole is halved, Jordan would be 9up with eight to play. He\u2019s won 9&amp;8. Similarly McIlroy can be said to have lost 9&amp;8. The USA would add a point to their overall total. I\u2019ve probably made this sound way more complicated than it needs to be, but there it is anyway.</p> <p><strong>There will be three types of match:</strong> foursomes (teams of two players use one ball, taking alternate shots); fourballs (teams of two players play a ball each and take the best score, known as the better ball); and singles (this is when it gets quite wild and everyone across two continents starts with the shallow breathing and chest clutching). And these matches are arranged in a schedule like this:</p> <p><strong>Today:</strong> four matches of morning foursomes; four matches of afternoon fourballs.<br> <strong>Tomorrow: </strong>four matches of morning foursomes; four matches of afternoon fourballs.<br> <strong>Sunday: </strong>12 singles matches.</p> <p><strong>Today\u2019s foursomes tee off at <em>(all times CT)</em>:</strong> 7.35am Spieth/Reed v Rose/Stenson, 7.50am Mickelson/Fowler v McIlroy/Sullivan, 8.05am Walker/Z Johnson v Garcia/Kaymer, and 8.20am D Johnson/Kuchar v Pieters/Westwood. The fourballs tee off at 12.30pm, 12.45pm, 1pm and 1.15pm; the captains will announce the pairings later. So in the British Summer Time, we get going at 1.35pm. This really is on!</p> <p><strong>Your MBM reporter apologies in advance for: </strong>outrageous pro-European bias; outrageous pro-Sergio bias; outrageous pro-American bias through the prism of a self-hating European; childish excitement; childish tantrums; childish tears.</p> <p><strong>And finally, your cast-iron, no-quibble, OFFICIAL GUARDIAN GUARANTEE!!! </strong>There\u2019ll be not a single mention here of Brexit. This solemn promise also covers other original satirical observations and biting stand-up bits on: the European flag; Donald Trump\u2019s hair; golf being a good walk spoiled; golf not being a sport because players don\u2019t require the aerobic conditioning of the Brownlee brothers; mashed potato; people in golf clubs wearing clothing from the 1970s; people in golf clubs having attitudes from the 1970s; sweets you may remember from the 1970s; airplane peanuts.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-09-30T11:38:48.008Z\">at 12.38pm BST</time></p>  </div>",

Palmieri also denied Trump\u2019s wild accusation that Clinton or her campaign had helped Machado gain American citizenship, and Palmieri said that Clinton would likely address Trump\u2019s latest attack this afternoon at her rally in Coral Springs. \u201cThis is our opponent.

Therefore, I will keep standing, sharing my story, my absolute support Mrs. Clinton on behalf of women, my sisters, aunts, grandmothers, cousins, friends and female community. My Latin and in general, I want to thank all the support, love and respect, my career, my person as a human being and my family. I became a citizen of this great country because my daughter was born here and because I wanted to exercise my rights, including voting. I will continue standing firm in my lived experience as Miss Universe and you with me supporting me. I\u2019ve been so pleased with many kind words, for so much love. I\u2019m focusing on my busy career, in my work as mother and I will continue taking positive steps for the Latino community, I will continue as activist for women\u2019s rights and respect we deserve. I appreciate all your love and all your support again, thanks. \u201cThousands of blessings.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-09-30T15:18:32.567Z\">at 4.18pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57ee7f07e4b015be63832cb7\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-30T15:05:02.400Z\">4.05pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Ari Fleischer was a George W Bush press secretary:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/AriFleischer/status/781864033141923840\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Trump is on the verge of blowing it.

  "<p>Bristol had averaged two tries a match this season while conceding a total of 21 and, if in the final match in their run against last season\u2019s top three they took until the final 10 minutes of the game, rather than the first half, to give up a bonus point, they could not prevent Saracens showing in a largely uninspiring affair why they are the European and Premiership champions.</p> <p>Despite the largely one-sided nature of the contest which Saracens controlled from the off, they never went off script and indulged themselves, sticking instead to the direct formula that has made them so successful in recent seasons. Where Wasps and Exeter gave Bristol a few bones to gnaw on, all they had from Saracens was a plate licked clean.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/sep/30/northampton-exeter-premiership-rugby-union-match-report\">Harry Mallinder boots Northampton to thrilling win over Exeter</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The outcome was Saracens\u2019 biggest Premiership victory over Bristol, who failed to muster a point at home in the tournament for the first time and remain adrift at the bottom. They will not be judged by how they get on against the champions, last season\u2019s beaten finalists, Exeter, and the current leaders, Wasps, but their performances against the teams in the bottom half of the table, starting with Newcastle next weekend.</p> <p>Bristol held Saracens to 10 points in the first half, defending stoutly and attacking sporadically. Saracens, who at one point had a territorial domination of 74%, never deviated from the tried and proven, running hard, taking play through phases and waiting for defensive lapses which grew as fatigue became a factor.</p> <p>Their first try came after 12 minutes when Alex Lozowski, marking his elevation to England\u2019s elite squad in his fifth appearance for Saracens having been third choice at Wasps, ran at the outside shoulder of Jack Lam and away from the flanker. Otherwise Bristol held firm, defending driving mauls effectively and keeping their shape, restricting their opponents to a Ben Spencer penalty for the rest of the opening half.</p> <p>Within five minutes of the restart it was all over. Spencer kicked his second penalty before Lozowski charged down Adrian Jarvis\u2019s laboured clearance and somehow managed to apply downward pressure on the ball a millisecond before it and he reached the dead-ball line. It was a rare moment of skill on the night when the only issue was when Saracens would secure the bonus point.</p> <p>They did so on 70 minutes. The full-back Chris Wyles had scored their third try, profiting from a pass by Schalk Burger, who spotted Ryan Edwards coming out of the defensive line too quickly and timed his pass to ensure Wyles had only space in front of him and the fourth immediately followed Max Crumpton\u2019s dispatch to the sin-bin as the hooker paid for what had become persistent infringing by his side.</p> <p>The penalty was turned into a driving lineout and there was no stopping Jamie George. The extra point did not satisfy Saracens who kept rolling forward and, after Jack Tovey had made his side\u2019s first and only line break, George Kruis completed the scoring on the stroke of full-time, rewarding his side\u2019s relentless, grinding efficiency.</p> <p>Bristol had their moments, stealing a couple of lineouts, turning two driving mauls into scrums and shoving their opponents back in the scrum occasionally, but it was a night when their inexperience showed against opponents who gave them nothing. If Saracens had not been coming off the back of a rare defeat, they might have been more incautious but, given the unfamiliar back division they fielded because of injuries and the suspension to Chris Ashton, that was never likely on a night when their focus was on playing to their strengths and winning.</p> <p>\u201cI am bitterly disappointed,\u201d said Bristol\u2019s director of rugby, Andy Robinson, who opted in the post-match media conference to issue a monologue rather than take questions. \u201cWe started better but did not perform for 80 minutes and wasted the good work of the first half in the first five minutes of the second by giving away a penalty and having a kick charged down, things that were in our control. We have to learn and whether we are doing so quickly enough we will find out at Newcastle.\u201d</p> <p>Saracens moved to the top of the table, although their stay will be brief if Wasps defeat Harlequins on Sunday . If they were missing experience behind, they were at full throttle at forward where Kruis, Maro Itoje, Burger and Billy Vunipola, until he was taken off as a precaution following a knock on his shoulder, had too much know-how for Bristol. \u201cIt was a professional performance,\u201d said their director of rugby, Mark McCall. \u201cWe put Bristol under pressure throughout and it told when they became weary.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Bristol</strong> J Williams; Edwards (Wallace,60), Tovey, Hurrell (Jarvis, 29), Amesbury; Pisi, Cliff; Traynor (Bevington,48), McMillan (Crumpton, 60), Perenise (Cortes,60), Phillips (Joyce, 57), Sorenson, Fisher, Lam (capt; Eadie,55), Crane.</p> <p><strong>Saracens</strong> Wyles; Ellery (Perkins, 72), Tompkins, Barritt (Bosch, 67), Gallagher; Lozowski, Spencer (Wigglesworth, 55); M Vunipola (Barrington, 55), George (Spurling, 72), Du Plessis (Figallo, h-t), Itoje (Hamilton, 63), Kruis, Wray, Burger, B Vunipola (Rhodes, 46).</p> <p><strong>Referee</strong> I Tempest. <strong>Attendance</strong> 11,592.</p>",

  "<p>You may know Director X\u2019s music videos: they tend to win awards, attract hundreds of millions of viewers, and celebrate dancing, whether in a restaurant (Rihanna and Drake\u2019s Work), in a high school (Iggy Azalea\u2019s Fancy), on the marquee of the Compton Fashion Center (Kendrick Lamar\u2019s King Kunta), or on a construction site (Fifth Harmony\u2019s Work from Home). He\u2019d like to inform you, however, that his newest work \u2013 a piece of installation art that projects, on to a 45ft sphere, computer graphics depicting the eventual burnout of our sun \u2013 is, as he puts it, \u201cmuch more representative of the artist I am\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/feb/22/rihannas-work-music-videos-the-five-best-moments\">Rihanna's Work music videos \u2013 \u00a0the five best moments</a> </p> </aside>  <p> Created for Toronto\u2019s Nuit Blanche event, Death of the Sun makes the man born Julien Lutz the latest prominent music-world figure to venture into the realm of visual art. These aren\u2019t just ageing rockers who turn to painting when their touring slows down, but stars in their prime, for whom art scratches an itch that bling can\u2019t reach.</p> <p> Jay Z has worked with the performance artist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2015/dec/07/marina-abramovic-igor-levit-bach-goldberg-variations\">Marina Abramovi\u0107</a>, and Kanye West has paid homage to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/jun/28/kanye-west-famous-video-is-it-art\">Vincent Desiderio\u2019s painting Sleep</a>. Rihanna\u2019s press conference for her latest album, Anti, was billed as a \u201cprivate viewing\u201d of the booklet artwork by Roy Nachum. Drake posted pictures of himself inside James Turrell\u2019s lightboxes before shooting a video for Hotline Bling \u2013 helmed by Director X \u2013 that filtered Lutz\u2019s own preoccupations with the spatial geometry of dancing through a Turrell-esque realm of saturated color.</p> <p> \u201cBoundaries are opening up,\u201d says Floria Sigismondi, known for her surreal videos for the likes of Rihanna, David Bowie and Marilyn Manson. Sigismondi is premiering her own work, Pneuma, in tandem with Death of the Sun, at Nuit Blanche. \u201cAs a whole,\u201d she says, \u201csociety is much more open to having people cross over into different disciplines, where before, the art world was very closed off.\u201d</p> <p> But why should it be so attractive? Lutz cites the producer Swizz Beatz, who started collecting art as a teenager in the late 1990s and now sits on the board of the Brooklyn Museum. \u201cHe brought that to [hip-hop] culture, with Jay Z: \u2018Look at this art I bought.\u2019 And Jay Z said, \u2018Yeah, that resonates with me.\u2019 And then people started going down that line and embracing that part of ourselves, where perhaps earlier [we had] a little bravado, or it wasn\u2019t cool enough.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/aug/04/virtual-insanity-vr-new-frontier-music-videos-waves\">Virtual insanity: is VR the new frontier for music videos?</a> </p> </aside>  <p> Now, art itself generates bravado: where Jay Z used to boast about selling millions of albums, he now brags about being \u201csurrounded by Warhols\u201d, with a \u201cyellow Basquiat\u201d in his kitchen corner. It\u2019s not enough to be at the summit of the rap game; he calls himself \u201cthe modern day Pablo\u201d \u2013 just as Kanye West has insisted: \u201cI am Pablo.\u201d </p> <p> Picasso, who clearly contains multitudes, represents what Sigismondi calls \u201ca sense of fearlessness that our souls just crave; we\u2019re drawn to people that can live like that\u201d. The artists who \u201cstick out are always pushing buttons, doing things that others have never done, whether it\u2019s Picasso with cubism or Van Gogh with his colors.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"133c2c0ba8533164407f5f6f613b3aa2b935271b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/133c2c0ba8533164407f5f6f613b3aa2b935271b/0_528_4032_2419/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The 45ft sphere on to which Death of the Sun will be projected.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The 45ft sphere on to which Death of the Sun will be projected.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mark Dwyer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p> Not that Van Gogh was able to flog more than a very small part of his oeuvre during his lifetime \u2013 he was hardly the Jay Z of his day. But perhaps because of this, his art represents what both Lutz and Sigismondi refer to as the ideal of \u201cpurity\u201d. Despite the corporate sponsors that might pop up at Art Basel (as they would at a Beyonc\u00e9 concert), the artist, for Sigismondi, is seen to \u201creally own\u201d his or her work. \u201cArtists have always been held up a little bit maybe because they can comment on the world [without] thinking about commerce. There isn\u2019t a record company, or [someone asking], \u2018What\u2019s your audience?\u2019\u201d</p> <p> For Lutz, working with Nuit Blanche has been \u201ca very different experience. There\u2019s no client. It\u2019s me and the city doing this, and the city\u2019s very much, \u2018We\u2019ll facilitate what you want to do.\u2019 It wasn\u2019t any of those ideas, like, \u2018Oh, naked girls!\u2019 \u2018Oh, we can\u2019t show nakedness.\u2019 The piece is unique. It\u2019s definitely my voice.\u201d</p> <p> Compacting the next 12bn years of our resident star into 12 minutes, Death of the Sun<em> </em>finds the 40-year-old Lutz reflecting on mortality: the star morphs from its current yellow sun stage (in its \u201csexy prime time\u201d) into a bloated red giant (\u201cwhat I\u2019m entering as I gain weight, no matter what I do\u201d, he laughs) and then collapses into a white dwarf. It also gives vent to what he calls his science fiction \u201cnerd\u201d tendencies. </p> <p>Sigismondi sees Pneuma<em> </em>as a personal project too: \u201cI had been in the past more preoccupied with the body, so it was a natural progression to go to the spirit.\u201d It\u2019s a short, mystical film, set to a Boards of Canada track, with flowing visuals projected on to a 33ft-high water screen created by a fountain \u2013 via a fire truck hidden away \u2013 in the middle of an artificial pond. Sigismondi herself appears as a figure in a red dress inscribed with ancient symbols and lyrics by David Bowie, himself a painter and art collector, to whom she\u2019s paying tribute. </p> <p>If anything, though, both pieces offer the antithesis of \u201cI am a great artist\u201d braggadocio. They\u2019re both part of an exhibition called Oblivion, and at the end of Pneuma<em>, </em>Sigismondi\u2019s figure disappears into the water as if dissipating. Death of the Sun\u2019s scale, according to Lutz, aims to impress the viewer with a sense of our collective insignificance: \u201cEverything is just a dot.\u201d </p> <ul> <li><a href=\"https://nbto.com/\">Nuit Blanche</a> runs from sunset on 1 October to sunrise on 2 October in Toronto. Death of the Sun and Pneuma will have an extended run from 2 October through 10 October, from 7pm until midnight.<br></li> </ul>",

But it\u2019s hard for me to understand why we have to go to war, why kids have to kill kids around the world. So I have mixed feelings about being here. I\u2019m very proud of this country.

I told him, maybe we can get a little copy, if there\u2019s a copy of the speech, just so he can hear some of it. That\u2019s his right.\u201d</p> <p>Hornacek was asked if he understood where Noah was coming from. \u201cOh, absolutely,\u201d he said. \u201cJo\u2019s done, in all his stuff that he does against gun violence and all that, he just didn\u2019t feel comfortable, so that\u2019s plenty fine with us.\u201d</p> <p>Noah also said he supported athletes such as Colin Kaepernick using their profile to draw attention to social issues.</p> <p>\u201cI think there\u2019s a lot of topics that definitely need to be more than addressed,\u201d he said. \u201cI think it\u2019s a very important time right now.

Firstly, the player at the back stick was in an offside position when the ball was played but did not become active. I don\u2019t think the assistant has flagged for that. Then McArthur runs close to the ball in front of the goal. Is he \u2018clearly attempting to play a ball which is close to him when this action impacts on an opponent\u2019? I don\u2019t think the assistant can decide that. We can only hope that the officials have talked over the intercom and that Moss has used his better angle to interpret the situation.

It\u2019s a position that arguably makes her the most powerful woman in Parisian fashion since Coco Chanel. The moment is significant not only because Dior is a byword for style that has currency all over the world, but because it\u2019s a house that symbolises womanhood itself.

The very first outfit in this show was an off-white quilted jacket and cropped trousers, which the designer said were based on \u201cthe uniform of the female fencer [which] is, with the exception of some special protections, the same as for a male fencer\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"30e8f5345f145c9ac4c9a3f166e60a29d2a3aa36\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/30e8f5345f145c9ac4c9a3f166e60a29d2a3aa36/0_0_3266_5303/616.jpg\" alt=\"A model presents a creation for Christian Dior during the 2017 Spring/Summer ready-to-wear collection fashion show\" width=\"616\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Pure Dior drama.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Francois Guillot/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Valentino fans hoping to see that label\u2019s distinctive Renaissance-princess silhouette amplified at Dior were disappointed. With hindsight, the Valentino moment that best predicted what Chiuri would do at Dior came last year, when she enlisted Ben Stiller and Owen Wilson (in character as Derek Zoolander and Hansel) <a href=\"http://fashionista.com/2015/03/zoolander-valentino\">to end a show with a surprise walk-off</a>, part of a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/feb/14/zoolander-2-ben-stiller-owen-wilson-penelope-cruz-review-mark-kermode\">Zoolander 2</a> publicity campaign. Chiuri\u2019s love of pop culture was clear when she paid homage in her first Dior show not to the house\u2019s signature tailoring, but to the \u201cJ\u2019adore Dior\u201d T-shirt worn by Sarah Jessica Parker in Sex and the City. \u201cThere are many people who, when they think of Dior, they think of that T-shirt,\u201d she said after the show.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e395cf4122568b4a6a8819df2b912968e2b28173\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e395cf4122568b4a6a8819df2b912968e2b28173/0_0_2648_4514/587.jpg\" alt=\"A model presents a creation for Christian Dior during the 2017 Spring/Summer ready-to-wear collection fashion show\" width=\"587\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The punk spirit was present at times.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Francois Guillot/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The clothes themselves seemed very much secondary to the message. The honeybee motif that featured on Dior menswear last decade, when it was designed by Hedi Slimane, was embroidered on shirts, emblazoned in gold on handbags and embossed on the invitations. As well as the feminist message of questioning gender traditions that borrowing a menswear motif suggests, the designer said backstage that she wanted \u201cher Dior\u201d to reference not just Monsieur Dior\u2019s early collections, but \u201cso many other talents who have worked here \u2013 Slimane, Galliano, Raf Simons, Gianfranco Ferre\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3a0a4380c5288f331d3dc33745098b1157db734a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3a0a4380c5288f331d3dc33745098b1157db734a/0_0_3648_5472/667.jpg\" alt=\"A model presents a creation for Christian Dior during the 2017 Spring/Summer ready-to-wear collection fashion show\" width=\"667\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A softer side to the collection.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Francois Guillot/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Chiuri, who is 52 and until recently lived in Rome, began her career at Fendi, where she was part of the team that created the famous \u201cbaguette\u201d bag.

  "<p>If it\u2019s an unnerving experience to have nine-time Grammy winner Mary J Blige close her eyes and sing directly to you about police violence from just a few feet away, Hillary Clinton didn\u2019t show it. <br></p> <p>Clinton is the first guest to appear on the hip-hop soul singer\u2019s new show The 411 with Mary J Blige \u2013 a reference to her 1992 debut album \u2013 now streaming on Apple Music, and it\u2019s definitely a little different from a typical presidential nominee interview.</p> <p>\u201cMay I call you Hillary,\u201d asked Blige, who had been calling her \u201cSecretary Clinton\u201d earlier in the interview.</p> <p>\u201cYes, you may,\u201d replied Clinton.</p> <p>\u201cOK Hillary, I want to share something with you I haven\u2019t shared with anyone,\u201d declared Blige, announcing that she was going to sing her a song: Bruce Springsteen\u2019s 41 Shots, written about Amadou Diallo in 1999, an unarmed black man who was killed by four NYPD officers.</p> <p>\u201cIt means a lot to me just because of everything that\u2019s taking place now,\u201d said Blige, a reference to the recent high-profile examples of unarmed black men and women who have been killed by police.</p> <p>\u201cI just want to share it with you because believe that so many women, African American women, feel like this when they\u2019re sending their children off to school in the morning,\u201d Blige said.</p> <p>Blige closed her eyes, and started singing to Clinton, who initially had on her best poker face.</p> <p>The lyrics are incredibly relevant after the deaths of Terence Crutcher in Tulsa, Alfred Olango in San Diego and 13-year-old Tyre King in Columbus, Ohio \u2013 all unarmed black males shot and killed by police in the last two weeks. </p> <p>\u201cIf an officer stops you, always be polite / And you\u2019ll never ever run away, promise mama you\u2019ll keep your hands in sight / Is it a gun, is it a knife, is it a wallet, is it your life,\u201d sang Blige.</p> <p>As Blige sang about black people getting killed by police, she reached out and held Clinton\u2019s hand. </p> <p>A preview <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AppleMusic/status/780615986344898561?lang=en\">published on social media</a> made the singing look cringe-worthy, with viewers noting Clinton\u2019s ability to remain diplomatic in uncomfortable situations.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/NyashaMC/status/780609126602792960\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Anyone who can keep a straight face while Mary J.

Clinton seemed genuinely emotional, sighing \u201cOh Mary, oh Mary,\u201d at the end of the song.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>\u201cWhere do we go from here? What is the first thing you would do to begin the healing process with all this?\u201d Blige asked.</p> <p>The pair continued to hold hands, all four hands entwined together almost like they were in prayer. </p> <p>\u201cI have been so heartbroken over what\u2019s been going on because it\u2019s fundamentally at odds and wrong that African American parents have to sit their children down and deliver the message you just sang,\u201d Clinton responded.</p> <p>Clinton mentioned \u201cimplicit bias\u201d during the debate, noting \u201cimplicit bias is a problem for everyone, not just police.\u201d Although he didn\u2019t disagree at the time, Donald Trump brought it up at a rally this week, saying that asserting Clinton \u201caccuses the entire country \u2013 including all of law enforcement \u2013 of implicit bias, essentially suggesting that everyone, including our police, are basically racist and prejudiced\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cI think we\u2019ve got to be honest that there needs to be a greater opening of our hearts to one another, put ourselves in each other\u2019s shoes, feel the pain that a mother and a father feel when their son and daughter can go out the door and they don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen to them,\u201d Clinton said. \u201cI particularly want white people to understand what that\u2019s like and to feel that they must be part of the solution.\u201d</p> <p>Clinton spoke about needing to train police in better de-escalation techniques and \u201cto really address implicit bias so that a young black man walking down the street is not a threat, he\u2019s a young black man walking down the street,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Seems that singing really touched a nerve. \u201cI\u2019ve been interviewed so many times, nobody has ever sung in the middle of the interview. That was so touching to me. Obviously the issue, the subject is so profound but just doing it was so moving to me, thank you,\u201d added Clinton, who looked like she might cry.</p> <p>Blige asked if Clinton thought it was hard for a woman to be both tough and likable.</p> <p>\u201cYes,\u201d replied Clinton instantly. \u201cI think it\u2019s really hard, to be honest with you, it\u2019s really hard,\u201d she said, dissolving into laughter.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know why it\u2019s so hard. I think it\u2019s rooted in tens of thousands of years of how people\u2019s lives have been defined, what it\u2019s meant to be a woman or a man and how society was organized. For women to be assuming leading roles in business or entertainment or politics or whatever it might be, it\u2019s still not fully understood because there\u2019s no blueprint for doing it,\u201d Clinton added.</p> <p>And it turns out it\u2019s not so hard to get your hands on Hamilton tickets if you\u2019re famous, Clinton revealing she had seen the musical four times. She revealed the soundtrack was a regular on her playlist.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s just a work of genius. It\u2019s obsessing me right now. That\u2019s my number one go-to,\u201d she said.</p> <p>The pair also chatted about the impact of Clinton\u2019s mother on her life \u2013 she named her and Nelson Mandela as her personal heroes \u2013 and the role of religion in her life. \u201cBeing a person of faith has sustained me over the course of my life,\u201d she said. They also talked about what it\u2019s like to be famous and handling criticism.</p> <p>\u201cThe public eye has a way of magnifying things that aren\u2019t important and dismissing things that are,\u201d Clinton said.</p> <p>\u201cWow,\u201d replied Blige, who\u2019s currently going through a high-profile divorce.</p> <p>At the end of the interview, the pair hugged and thanked each other repeatedly. \u201cThat was so emotional!\u201d Clinton quipped.</p>",

  "<p>The Society for Threatened Peoples (STP) has sent an appeal to the governments of the Russian Federation and the United States, demanding an end to the armed conflict in Syria. Given the serious war crimes against the civilian population of Aleppo and other cities, we urgently call for a peaceful solution for Syria.</p> <p>The STP demands that Russia stop bombing the eastern parts of Aleppo that are controlled by Islamist rebels, and persuades the allied Syrian regime to withdraw its air force from there as well \u2013 immediately. The US must ensure that all radical Islamist groups in the area of Aleppo are disarmed, or that they will at least comply with a ceasefire. In our opinion, this would be the only way to prevent a mass exodus from the parts of the city that are controlled by the regime. There are still about 1.5 million people \u2013 including at least 100,000 Christians, Armenians, Assyrians/Aramaeans/Chaldeans, Kurds, Alevis, Ismailis, Shias and Yazidis \u2013 living there. For them, the radical Islamist groups, who want to turn Aleppo into a purely Sunni-Arab city, are a deadly threat.</p> <p>While Russia and Iran as well as Shia militias are supporting the Syrian regime by all means, the US and the other Nato countries, Saudi Arabia and Qatar are providing the radical Islamists with even more weapons. The pro-Islamic Turkish government supports the Islamists as well \u2013 as an attempt to destroy the \u201coasis of peace\u201d in northern Syria. There, the Kurds and their Assyrian Aramaic, Arabic and Turkmen allies were able to fend off the Islamist fighters as well as Assad\u2019s troops. The Kurds are consistently following a secular agenda, and they have already provided shelter for hundreds of thousands of refugees in the region under their control.<br><strong>Kamal Sido</strong><br><em>STP, G\u00f6ttingen, Germany</em></p> <p>\u2022 Ban Ki-moon\u2019s accusation that Russia and the Syrian regime are \u201ccommitting war crimes\u201d (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/28/aleppo-two-hospitals-bombed-out-of-service-syria-airstrikes\" title=\"\">Aleppo begs for help as Assad forces hit hospitals</a>, 29 September), confirms the need for urgent action to halt the atrocities. In recent times only sanctions appear to have reined Russia in. A December 2014 EU Institute for Security Studies report said of combined EU and US sanctions, which were largely financial and commercial, including a two-way arms embargo, against Russia over Ukraine: \u201cRestrictive measures might have bolstered Putin in the short term but might also seriously constrain him in the longer term\u201d, but nevertheless: \u201csanctions can be preventive.\u201d Sanctions against Russia must be deployed urgently along with diplomacy once again. <br><strong>David Murray</strong><br><em>Wallington, Surrey</em></p> <p>\u2022 Adrian Hamilton\u2019s perception of Syria under the Assad regime (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/28/west-aleppo-syrians-bombardment-assad\" title=\"\">The west has to look beyond Aleppo\u2019s agony</a>, 28 September) is very much at odds with mine formed by two years living and working in the country; but these things are often subjective. However, his assertion that \u201cNo one who remembers how Assad\u2019s father put down the revolt in Hama in 1982 can doubt the ruthlessness with which the Alawite regime acts against its opponents\u201d is downright misleading. The 1982 Hama rebellion was led by the Muslim Brotherhood who objected to the secular nature of the Assad regime and specifically to the a change in the law which would have allowed a \u201cnon-Muslim\u201d to become president. Had this uprising succeeded, Syria would by now almost certainly be a caliphate.</p> <p>More confusing is the article\u2019s prediction that an Assad victory would involve \u201ctaking on the Kurds\u201d. In the early years of the present conflict the Kurds were put under great pressure by Turkey to join them in attacking the Assad regime, something they refused to do. The main anti-Assad group at Geneva, the HNC, comprises three groups regarded by many in the west as being terrorist but excludes Kurdish representatives. The Kurds who, like the Christian and displaced Palestinian communities have lived in peace with their Syrian neighbours for decades, have been the most effective fighters against Islamic State. Why then in the aftermath of war would Assad seek confrontation with the Kurds?</p> <p>Whatever goal is chosen it should not involve finding \u201canother way to stop Assad from winning the war\u201d. Restoring a peaceful climate in which UN-supervised elections could be held, thus enabling the Syrian people to chose their own leader free from outside influences, would appear to be the way to go.<br><strong>Paul Hewitson</strong><br><em>Berlin</em></p> <p>\u2022 The hysterical army of protesters who condemn Tony Blair for his part in the Iraq war (ie removing a mass-murdering dictator) maintained that political efforts to find peace had not been exhausted.

Its current chair is Prof Alexis Jay, a former social worker.<br></p> <p>Another lawyer has also stepped down. Abigail Bright, a barrister at Doughty Street Chambers, left because of delays in the module dealing with allegations surrounding the former Labour MP Greville Janner. <br></p> <p>The Independent Police Complaints Commission is looking at the police handling of initial investigations. The IICSA said it believed Bright was still available to work; however, her chambers said she had quit the inquiry \u201cpermanently\u201d earlier in the summer.<br></p> <p>There have been calls for the separate strands of the inquiry \u2013 such as those into the Catholic church or Lambeth council, for example \u2013 to be given greater powers so that they can move ahead in parallel rather than being more slowly run in succession. <br></p> <p>\u201cWhat is crucial is whether the victims and survivors\u2019 consultative panel (VSCP) still feel they have confidence in the inquiry,\u201d said Alison Millar, head of the abuse team at the London law firm Leigh Day.<br></p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s been such an omnishambles from start to finish. It\u2019s such a worry for people who have given evidence to the inquiry. They have heard reports about chaos in the document storage system [which contains] 100,000 children\u2019s social work files. <br></p> <p>\u201cWhat you can\u2019t do is go back on the terms of reference. At the moment we would be telling [clients] to have a cautious look at what\u2019s happening with the inquiry \u2026 I might be saying, hold fire for the moment.<br></p> <p>\u201cWe really want this inquiry to succeed but people are now very worried that it won\u2019t and that engagement will at best make no difference and at worst will result in retraumatisation for nothing,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Peter Garsden, head of abuse claims at the Cheshire solicitors Simpson Millar, called for the inquiry to be redesigned so that the individual investigations into separate areas of abuse could move ahead faster within an overarching inquiry.</p> <p>\u201cThey need a lead counsel for each module of the inquiry,\u201d Garsden said. \u201cIt\u2019s too much for one person to do altogether. If they ran them in parallel at different venues, I\u2019m sure they would get through them much quicker. I also understand that their case management system is not fit for purpose. It needs a root and branch reappraisal.\u201d <br></p> <p>Peter Saunders, of the National Association for People Abused in Childhood (NAPAC), attended the day-long meeting at the IICSA on Friday as a member of the VSCP. <br></p> <p>He said members of the victims\u2019 panel were reassured and felt positive about the future work of the inquiry: \u201cWe felt a sense of renewal. There is no exodus of staff and everyone is very determined to get on with it. We were reassured and we understand that the review being carried out [by Jay] will come back imminently. <br></p> <p>\u201cThroughout our time on the victims and survivors\u2019 panel, we have given our input and I would hope what we say is being considered as part of the review.\u201d <br></p> <p>Saunders said the meeting took place with the inquiry secretariat but Jay was not present.<br></p> <p>Gabrielle Shaw, the NAPAC chief executive, said: \u201cWe still support the inquiry. It was an acknowledgement of the scale of child abuse in institutional settings.</p> <p>\u201cBut there\u2019s a lot of anger over Ben Emmerson being suspended and resigning. A lot of people have invested personally in the inquiry. It\u2019s the most ambitious inquiry the UK has ever undertaken. <br></p> <p>\u201cPeople have been waiting for decades for this. They want it to be perfect and they want to be consulted. It would be a tragedy if it was stopped.\u201d</p> <p>Yvette Cooper, the former shadow home secretary and a candidate to become chair of the home affairs select committee, said the inquiry needed \u201ca strategic rethink\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a big problem that we\u2019re two years on from starting the inquiry, and we have four chairs, a new legal team and on most of the individual inquiries within the framework they haven\u2019t taken any evidence,\u201d she said.</p> <p>While the overall terms of reference were correct, Cooper argued, the structure of the sub-inquiries was too mixed, and so far there had not been enough transparency or obvious progress.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a shambles at the moment, a real mess. That\u2019s not fair on huge numbers of people who really have put their faith and hopes into this as a way to get justice.\u201d</p> <p>Caroline Flint, another Labour MP bidding to chair the home affairs committee, said the government should consider allowing Jay to appoint other chairs to cover specific elements of the inquiry.<br></p> <p>\u201cThat might allow some opportunities for more coherence, and also to enable those chairs to see the wood for the trees,\u201d Flint said. \u201cBut importantly, even if it is broken down into more manageable areas, at the end of all this they need to bring together the common themes, and where different agencies have failed together.\u201d<br></p> <p>Flint, who stressed she was seeking no party advantage given that the abuse also took place under Labour governments, said the appointment of Jau and the departure of Emmerson could be a good time to change the structure of the inquiry.<br></p> <p>\u201cEveryone wants to do the right thing here, by victims and by getting our systems of protection into a better place. There\u2019s nothing to be ashamed in saying, actually, we need to do this better.\u201d<br></p> <p>Flint stressed the importance of the inquiry reporting on what it had learned as it progressed: \u201cWe have children at risk today, and it\u2019s really important that we use what we already know from various inquiries as to how we can protect children better now and in the future.\u201d<br></p> <p>It is understood that Emmerson and Prochaska are not able to talk publicly about their departure. In the face of speculation over the cause of their resignations, the inquiry declined to elaborate. Asked whether its legal teams sign confidentiality agreements, a spokesperson replied: \u201cLawyers have professional duties of confidentiality.\u201d</p> <p>A Home Office spokesperson said: \u201cBen Emmerson\u2019s resignation is a matter for the independent inquiry, which is continuing its vital work in exposing the failure of public bodies and other organisations to prevent systematic child sexual abuse.</p> <p>\u201cOur commitment to this inquiry is undiminished. We owe it to victims and survivors to confront the appalling reality of how children were let down by the very people who were charged to protect them and to learn from the mistakes of the past.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Several years ago I had to explain to a leading professional cyclist precisely why it was that the media and hardcore cycling fans were so determined to remain sceptical, in some cases in a very vocal way, about performances that stood out and about explanations that did not quite fit. The analogy I used was that of someone who had suspected for years that their partner was being unfaithful but had continually given him or her the benefit of the doubt, before eventually being presented with conclusive proof.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/sep/30/bradley-wiggins-full-story-asthma-allergies-tues\">Bradley Wiggins opens up with full story on asthma, allergies and TUEs</a> </p> </aside>  <p>With that experience in recent memory, you would be pretty damn careful about putting your faith in anyone else; when you spotted anything bordering on the suspicious your antennae would be sensitive, your emotions raw, your fear of being caught out again intense. My interlocutor got the point, although the fact that the explanation needed to be made says much about the distance in thought process between top sportspeople and those who follow them.</p> <p>Since the Fancy Bears hacking team released details of Sir Bradley Wiggins\u2019s therapeutic use exemption certificates for triamcinolone, I have had to look for a different analogy. The vexed question of just where the moral boundaries are drawn between being prudent, evading tax and avoiding tax seems uncannily similar to the question of what TUEs are acceptable and what aren\u2019t, and in what circumstances.</p> <p>The facts of the case presented by Wiggins to the Guardian this week \u2013 details of his allergies and asthma, the timelines of specialists visits, TUE applications and so on \u2013 backed up by speaking to some of those close to him, make it clear that the strict letter of the anti-doping rules was followed, hence his use of the corticosteroid triamcinolone was within the rules at the time.</p> <p>The objective in visiting Wiggins this week was not to be judge, jury and executioner. I wanted to get what facts I could and build a complete idea of what had taken place and when, to get much clarity as possible. Hence the decision \u2013 with the cyclist\u2019s agreement \u2013 to run the interview in full on this newspaper\u2019s website.</p> <p>The picture painted tallies with what has become clear over the years: while even the best cycling teams look perfectly run on the surface, and like that impression to persist, in reality they are often scrabbling around holding it all together; in that context it makes sense that Wiggins didn\u2019t see his doctor for weeks at a key time in the season, visited a specialist at the last moment, and the first TUE was put together&#xa0;overnight.</p> <p>The use of Kenalog by injection to treat hay fever is a vexed one but the two GPs I spoke to \u2013 one from within the world of cycling, one from without \u2013 had few qualms about it. Until the NHS changed their guidelines a few years ago, you might give it to a student suffering from allergies before exams, and if you did, you might well do so shortly before the first paper.</p> <p>On the other hand, I cannot recall that any overt trace of Wiggins\u2019s allergy/asthma problem broke the surface in the eight years when I spoke quite frequently to him, often at some length. Had it done so, I would have ensured we discussed it when collaborating on his account of the years 2010-12 in the book My Time. I would have expected at least a passing mention followed perhaps by an immediate caveat that this should not be discussed right now, but the best I can manage is a vague recollection of something that may or may not have been said in 2009 about one rainy Tour stage through the Vosges mountains.</p> <p>This is by no means because one expects to be privy to every secret but because Wiggins was not always a guarded character when it came to things cycling-related. However, there were areas of his life we never discussed, primarily those away from bike races, so an absence of evidence may be noticeable but it is not incriminating in itself. Given that his doctors are bound by confidentiality, only a comprehensive trawl of those who had close contact with him over the last 12 years would show how visible his problems were to outsiders.</p> <p>The time line is consistent, although there are mistakes that imply a looseness with detail among those dealing with the paperwork: the rider himself cannot be blamed for those. Here Lady Bracknell\u2019s law applies: one mistake you might expect, more than that is a concern, not in this specific case, but more generally given how important and sensitive the process is.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/sep/30/bradley-wiggins-interview-tues\">Wiggins: \u2018I was paranoid about making excuses. It wasn\u2019t something I was going to shout from the rooftops\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The question of Dr Geert Leinders intrigues, as it has done since the end of 2012, hence my decision to press Wiggins over the nature of the contact he had had with the controversial doctor and what Leinders might have known. This was not the first time I had questioned him about the Belgian and the line remains consistent to the point of being unbreakable.</p> <p>The key question about Leinders\u2019 involvement is whether his hiring represented a major switch in Sky\u2019s marginal gains philosophy, well beyond the team\u2019s decision to ditch its founding philosophy on zero tolerance. While acknowledging that there have never been any allegations of improper practice relating to Leinders\u2019s spell at Sky, the Wiggins imbroglio prompts the obvious question: was this event an outlier or was it part of a pattern?</p> <p>For most individuals, gut feeling is the ultimate decider on your personal position on moral spectra such as these; to return to the tax analogy, you either believe it is acceptable to have a flat in Monaco to use as a tax address, or it\u2019s fine for an MP to \u201cflip\u201d a residence, or you don\u2019t. In cycling terms, the question I ask myself is this: if one of the young cyclists I advise was in the position Wiggins describes, and was to ask my view on whether he should do the same thing, which side of the line would I fall?</p> <p>I would advise against, for all it might be within the rules and a GP might justify it, simply because of the broader issues involved. The substance has too much resonance for me as a cyclist. Beyond my personal view, higher up the sporting food chain, reputational issues come into play as well; remaining within the letter of the law is one thing but with a certain stature comes a responsibility to remain within its spirit, too. You cannot travel into the grey area where Wiggins and Sky ventured in 2011-13 and expect your moral credibility to remain unscarred.</p>",

  "<p> Craig Atkinson\u2019s documentary about police militarization, <a href=\"http://www.donotresistfilm.com/\">Do Not Resist</a>, is filled with unsettling scenes like the one where a Swat team destroys a family\u2019s home during a drug raid that nets small amounts of loose marijuana. But the most disturbing scene transpires during the relative placidity of a seminar when a hugely successful lecturer tells a room full of police officers: \u201cWe are at war and you are the frontline.</p> <p> \u201cWhat do you fight violence with? Superior violence. Righteous violence. Violence is your tool \u2026 You are men and women of violence.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/sep/30/ava-duvernay-selma-13th-interview-criminal-justice-system\">Ava DuVernay: 'The black body is being used for profit and politics'</a> </p> </aside>  <p> The speaker, <a href=\"http://www.grossmanacademy.com/\">Dave Grossman</a>, is a retired army lieutenant colonel with a packed national speaking schedule. In the film, Grossman also promulgates the notion that one perk of violent encounters is that police often say that afterwards they have the best sex of their lives, which Atkinson, in an interview, sees as parallel to promising virgins to a suicide bomber. </p> <p> \u201cI wanted to show how ubiquitous his philosophy is and how it has been adopted throughout law enforcement,\u201d says Atkinson, whose movie won best documentary feature at the Tribeca Film Festival. It opens in New York on Friday and then gradually rolls out. (Grossman refused to be interviewed for this story.) \u201cI don\u2019t think they should be incentivizing law enforcement to commit violence. This is a rape and pillage philosophy versus a protect and serve philosophy.\u201d</p> <p> Justin Hansford, an assistant professor at St Louis University school of law, says this mentality has long existed but that the 9/11 attacks created a new level of fear among citizens and police and timidity among the politicians who should be preventing this escalation. \u201cIt\u2019s a jambalaya of all the wrong ingredients,\u201d he says. </p> <p> The seemingly endless police killings \u2013 from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ferguson\">Ferguson</a> to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/21/terence-crutcher-police-shooting-tulsa-activists-anger\">Tulsa </a>and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/27/keith-scott-killing-charlotte-little-girl-speech-viral\">Charlotte</a> \u2013 are directly linked to this issue, Hansford and Atkinson say.</p> <p> \u201cWhen so many people are being killed you need to look at why so many people in law enforcement are imbued with fear and are trigger happy,\u201d Atkinson says. \u201cI would love to open the debate of how we\u2019re training our officers.\u201d</p> <p> Peter Kraska, the chair at the Eastern Kentucky University\u2019s school of justice studies says this mindset has hardened in many police departments. \u201cThere has been a major shift so the culture of policing is now split and there is a huge component acting in an irrational manner and viewing themselves in this more militaristic way.\u201d</p> <p> Atkinson started making the film because he felt the hunt for the Boston marathon bombers was chaotic and heavy-handed in its use of military equipment but his interest started closer to home. His father was an officer in a city near Detroit and a longtime Swat team member and Atkinson was shocked to learn how the Swat mission had gradually changed. </p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Zt7bl5Z_oA\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/4Zt7bl5Z_oA?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p> Swat deployments are also occurring at a greater rate than ever. Atkinson\u2019s film cites statistics: in 1980 there were 3,000 Swat deployments but by 2005 that number had climbed to 45,000. Estimates place current annual numbers between 50,000 and 80,000. </p> <p> Much of that growth stems from a distorted twist on the famous Field of Dreams quotation: if you arm them they will raid. The federal government has been mindlessly handing over everything from bayonets to armored vehicles to police departments, inadvertently creating what may feel like an occupying military force: since 1997, the Pentagon\u2019s surplus giveaways have been worth more than $4bn, while the Department of Homeland Security has provided millions more in grants. </p> <p> \u201cI\u2019m not against the hardware,\u201d Atkinson says and Hansford echoes the belief that Swat teams and armored vehicles are necessary for the rare instances of acts of terrorism. However, that\u2019s not how they\u2019re used. </p> <p> \u201cEighty percent of Swat teams\u2019 missions are now for minor offenses, usually drugs, and nothing to do with their vital and original function,\u201d says <a href=\"http://justicestudies.eku.edu/people/kraska\">Pete Kraska</a>, the chair of graduate studies and research in the school of justice studies at Eastern Kentucky University. </p> <p> \u201cThere\u2019s mission creep,\u201d Kraska says, adding that using machine guns for civilian protest or raiding people\u2019s homes at 4am over minor, non-violent activities \u201cis manufacturing dangerous situations\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/sep/29/the-13th-review-ava-duvernay-new-york-film-festival-prisons-plantations-race-law-us\">13th review: Ava DuVernay doc shows prisons are the new plantations</a> </p> </aside>  <p> Hansford says this \u201ccomplete overkill\u201d is especially galling because \u201cSwat teams are targeting black and brown communities\u201d and do not go into white areas plagued by heroin epidemics with the same aggressive tactics. </p> <p> In the film, Swat teams revel in the adrenaline rush of military-style training with heavy weaponry and armored vehicles and one officer justifies it all by citing the need to be ready for Isis, WMDs and \u201ca situation like what they had in Missouri\u201d saying that civil protests warranted tanks and machine guns.</p> <p> Atkinson\u2019s movie takes viewers to places they probably never think much about. \u201cWe kept restricting ourselves to what we could actually show,\u201d he says. </p> <p> There was plenty to show, such as the public meetings in Concord, New Hampshire, about whether to accept a grant worth more than $250,000 for an armored vehicle. A retired colonel who served in Falluja testifies that this is wholly unnecessary while another veteran says it would make Concord live less free. The local council, however, votes 11-4 to bring it on. </p> <p> In South Carolina, Atkinson shows a crew that badly damages a home where all they find is some loose weed at the bottom of a bookbag. They arrest the man and then confiscate $1,000 he had for buying landscaping equipment for work. An officer tells the family \u201cit was an extractionary technique and we felt we needed to do it\u201d, and says with a shrug to the camera that drug raids are a 50-50 proposition in terms of finding something worthwhile. </p> <p> Atkinson shows that particular raid because he wanted to show how civil asset forfeiture (where the police confiscate goods and money for their own use before a person is even found guilty) has spiraled out of control but adds that he went out on a half-dozen raids around the country and the police never found anything worthwhile. \u201cDo you know the type of ill will generated in these communities?\u201d he says. \u201cIt makes the police seem like an occupying force.\u201d</p> <p> Eugene O\u2019Donnell, a former New York City police officer and prosecutor who is now a professor at the <a href=\"http://www.jjay.cuny.edu/\">John Jay College of Criminal Justice</a>, strongly disagrees, saying the genuine risks of terrorism or heavily armed drug dealers justify the behavior. He says seeing something sinister in militarization is \u201cpatently absurd\u201d and says liberals, but especially libertarians, simply \u201cdon\u2019t believe in police and think it\u2019s all Jim Crow, it\u2019s all abuse. They are a danger to society and are getting black people killed because police are afraid to get out of their cars.\u201d</p> <p> O\u2019Donnell acknowledges the excess and overreach of what he calls \u201cpenny ante raids\u201d and says they should be \u201creined in\u201d but points out that drugs are still illegal and argues that going in with overwhelming force can be safer for everyone. </p> <p> That viewpoint is taken up in the movie by the FBI director, <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2016/09/james-comey-not-weasels-clinton-email-228835\">James Comey</a>, who gives a speech that uses Trump-like phrasing to dismiss legitimate concerns, when he talks about \u201cso-called warrior cops, a term I have heard, and the militarization of police\u201d. He then proclaims \u201cmonsters are real\u201d and justifies the need for these weapons. The editing is a bit selective: the clip ends before Comey acknowledges that \u201cthe issue is the way in which we use it \u2013 when and how we deploy advanced equipment; when and how our officers are trained to use that equipment. The way we do it matters enormously.\u201d But Comey, like many defenders of militarization against an armed citizenry, does not speak out for stronger gun control to reduce the need for such equipment and attitudes.</p> <p> Do Not Resist shifts gears in the last 15 minutes to look at the explosive growth in police use of technology, from cameras in public spaces to facial recognition software to social media analysis. At first glance this seems far less problematic, especially since cameras helped lead to the speedy arrest of the alleged terrorist in the recent New York City bombing. But Hansford argues these surveillance tactics can be just as insidious. \u201cThe truth is not used for justice equally, it is used for power and control,\u201d he says. \u201cIt feels like a less direct threat because it is less visceral but there is a real danger of a slippery slope where the technology will be used for minor infractions and not enforced equally.\u201d</p> <p> Kraska is pessimistic about possible change, pointing out that departments can ramp up under the guise of community policing by saying they need armored vehicles and Swat teams \u201cto create a climate of order for the community. But that really is the model of an occupying force\u201d.</p> <p> Atkinson, who hopes that police academies would screen his film as part of training, counters that he has met officers \u201cwho are moving away from the Dave Grossman philosophy, realizing it\u2019s actually more dangerous for them and that de-escalation makes officers\u2019 lives safer\u201d. He believes these officers are looking for ways to get back to that old police motto, \u201cto protect and serve\u201d.</p>",

I travelled north on the advice of a friend, who thought the prevailing winds would help, but I ended up with gusts against me 90% of the way. This also meant my journey along the Thames was upstream. At the start, heavy rain and high winds made this incredibly difficult. You can\u2019t stop in the middle of a river when you\u2019re going upstream.

This was the start of carpal tunnel syndrome. Some days it took hours for me to grip properly: my hands were like pincers as I tried to pull my leggings on each morning. The worst point was Heartbreak Hill: a stretch of the Trent and Mersey canal with 29 locks, which I had to do in a single day \u2013 hauling my board and equipment on and off the water every time. By lock six, I was sobbing. I felt tired, hungry, alone.

I had incredible adventures: trekking in China, horseriding in Outer Mongolia. It reignited my love for the outdoors and made me feel invincible.

It\u2019s not \u201ctrendy punting\u201d \u2013 it\u2019s Britain\u2019s fastest growing watersport for a good reason. People fall in love with it because, mentally and physically, it feels so beneficial, so calming. I love going out in groups, chatting, stopping for a picnic or a drink.</p> <p>When I came back to London, I found out you can paddleboard on canals and rivers, so in the evenings and weekends I\u2019d head out. That\u2019s when I noticed the amount of discarded plastic on the water. It isn\u2019t just an eyesore: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/jan/02/plastic-waste-thames-marine-life-report\">it affects wildlife</a>. One day, I saw a coot\u2019s nest made up of as much plastic as twigs. I was horrified.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"48541eb944a96a0e7d83f0456352dafba6e6141e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/48541eb944a96a0e7d83f0456352dafba6e6141e/0_0_1600_960/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Lizzie with her kit on the 400-mile odyssey \u2013 and some of the rubbish she picked up.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lizzie with her kit on the 400-mile odyssey \u2013 and some of the rubbish she picked up.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Neil Irwin</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I wanted to draw attention to what is happening on our doorstep \u2013 to the canals and rivers that had been such places of comfort and restoration for me. So I decided to paddleboard the length of England, along its connected waterways, photographing every piece of plastic I saw, geo-tagging the location to create an online map that showed the scale of the problem. And anyone who wants to can add to the map.</p> <p>Although rubbish increased around towns and cities, even remote areas had plastic bags lurking in trees or bottles in the water. On the May bank holiday, I saw towpath bins overflowing with rubbish that blew into the canals.</p> <p><a href=\"http://lizzieoutside.co.uk/\">I\u2019m now on my next challenge</a>. I revisited the worst four spots \u2013 Tamworth, Coventry, Stoke-on-Trent and Manchester \u2013 and collected all the rubbish I saw. I spent seven hours on the banks of the Trent, near where I live, netting 600 or so bottles into a \u201ctrash raft\u201d which I then paddled along the river. The people I pass are always shocked to find out where the trash came from. The raft\u2019s sitting in my garden right now and I plan to go out on it again soon. It took a lot of work. It\u2019s going to be a family heirloom.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"00854e405e67c4bfdf047527606e0ab7a1064fdf\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/00854e405e67c4bfdf047527606e0ab7a1064fdf/0_0_3000_1875/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Plastic patrol \u2026 the map of clogged Britain\" width=\"1000\" height=\"625\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Plastic patrol \u2026 the map of clogged Britain</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Lizzie Carr</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I still feel quite emotional about my 400-mile journey: people would hear about me and come to cheer. Strangers brought food, sent messages, donated money. A groundskeeper gave me whisky and some canoeists invited me for a bacon sandwich and a cup of tea.</p> <p>One of the best paddleboarding tips is to keep moving forward as soon as you\u2019re standing. That way, the board\u2019s more stable, easier to control. Paddle, don\u2019t idle. It\u2019s good advice for life.</p> <p><em> \u2022 Lizzie\u2019s campaign and map: <a href=\"http://lizzieoutside.co.uk/\">lizzieoutside.co.uk</a>. </em><em>Interview by Homa Khaleeli</em>.</p> <h2>Surf, sand and cider \u2026 Lizzie\u2019s favourite paddle spots</h2> <p><strong>Bryher, Isles of Scilly<br></strong>Paddling almost anywhere on Scilly, you will enjoy picturesque coastline and clear blue waters, but the tiny island of Bryher is spectacular. One side is pounded by the Atlantic and best avoided on a paddleboard, but the other, parallel to the island of Tresco, is all calm seas and sandy beaches \u2013 nothing but the sound of the water against the paddle and birds flying overhead (<em>board hire: <a href=\"http://bennettboatyard.com/\">bennettboatyard.com</a>).</em></p> <p><strong> Isle of Arran, Scotland</strong><br> A friend of mine paddled around Arran last year and, having seen the photos, it\u2019s been on my must-visit list ever since. Whiting Bay, he says, particularly the north section, was his favourite. It\u2019s a remote, quiet area with easy access and runs for more than two miles. The water is calm if the winds are easterly, but conditions can get hairy if they are coming from the other direction. <em>(<a href=\"http://adventurecarrick.com/\">adventurecarrick.com</a>)</em></p> <p><strong>Mumbles, Wales</strong><br> Paddleboarding in the Mumbles, south of Swansea, has a unique British seaside vibe and the lighthouse at the end of the bay really adds to the charm. The area is relatively sheltered and, as you paddle underneath a centuries-old pier listening to the gulls circling above and the chatter of people out for a stroll, you get a great sense of the seaside. <em>(<a href=\"http://www.bigblueadventures.co.uk/\">bigblueadventures.co.uk</a>)</em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0dbcff534b09fcc8b760cb39637c87ad14ae0fbb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0dbcff534b09fcc8b760cb39637c87ad14ae0fbb/0_27_640_384/500.jpg\" alt=\"Mumbles lighthouse.\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mumbles lighthouse.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p> <br><strong> Bigbury Bay / Burgh Island, Devon</strong><br> Bigbury Bay is quite small and can get very busy in peak summer, but don\u2019t let that put you off. Paddling along the shoreline gives great views of the South West Coast Path. Looking out to the ocean you can see the tiny island of Burgh, which you can paddle up to and then enjoy a cider in the pub overlooking the bay. On the water itself, you can often see a variety of seabirds. <em>(<a href=\"http://www.discoverysurf.com/\">discoverysurf.com</a>)</em><br> <strong> Morecambe Bay, Lancashire </strong><br> I love the contrast of vast open water on one side and the Lakeland Fells in the distance on the other. That\u2019s what makes Morecambe a genuinely special place to paddle \u2013 particularly when the winds are low and the waters are calm. As the sun begins to set in the early evening, you will be presented with a truly unforgettable view. <em>(<a href=\"http://www.supnorth.co/\">supnorth.co</a>)</em></p>",
  "<p>Law enforcement chiefs have urged the government to ensure cross-border crime prevention measures are not jeopardised by Brexit negotiations, it has emerged.</p> <p>The director general and deputy director general of the National Crime Agency said they asked ministers to protect Britain\u2019s arrangements with Europe, including use of the European arrest warrant and membership of Europol, amid concerns about the impact of leaving the union.</p> <p>Membership of the EU gives the NCA and UK police forces access to tools which allow them to share intelligence quickly and efficiently with European counterparts.</p> <p>Lynne Owens, the NCA\u2019s director general, said at a briefing on Friday that the agency had approached the Home Office and Brexit department to raise its concerns.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ve been describing what we need to be in place post-Brexit,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re absolutely clear the policy decisions are not for us but we need to be spelling out the operational case.<br></p> <p>\u201cIn bluntest form, we must be able to continue to exchange intelligence and we must be able to understand the movement of criminals and criminal behaviour across international borders.

  "<p>\u201cI have had several thousand people over the course of the past two years ask me some variation of this question,\u201d Shaun King, the New York Daily News writer and activist, said. \u201cWhat else can I do about police brutality? Beyond what we\u2019re doing right now, what else can I do?\u201d The inquiry is something he has spent months \u201cnoodling around in [his] head\u201d, King told the Guardian.</p> <p>King and others believe the answer could be boycotts, a tool of change wielded in recent years against racial injustice and used during the civil rights movement of the 1960s. Last week, King revealed plans for what he hopes will be a massive and prolonged boycott, slated to begin in December. A few days earlier, the actor Isaiah Washington had announced his own, <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://time.com/4507756/actor-isaiah-washington-wants-black-americans-to-boycott-work-on-monday/\">making headlines</a> for his call on African Americans to boycott working, shopping and going to school for 24 hours as part of his #StayAtHomeSeptember262016 movement. Like the boycotts that came before them, both men are hoping their actions will create pressure on policymakers and bring about change.</p> <p>Washington\u2019s boycott also began with a question. \u201cImagine if every single African American in the United States that was really fed up with being angry, sad and disgusted, would pick ONE DAY to simply \u2018stay at home\u2019 from every single job, work site, sports arena and government office in the United States of America,\u201d the actor <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/isaiahwashington46/posts/10209222354172526\">asked his followers on Facebook</a>. \u201cI\u2019m very sure that within 72 hours from Wall Street to the NFL \u2026 Black Lives Would Matter.\u201d<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>The inspiration for the inquiry, Washington said, came from \u201cmy confusion, my pain, my distaste of the loss of a friend who was fighting for freedom\u201d, meaning Darren Seals, an activist and protest leader from Ferguson, Missouri, who was <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/08/ferguson-protest-leader-darren-seals-shot-dead-burning-car\">found shot dead in a burning car</a> earlier this month.

We don\u2019t have the luxury to organize,\u201d Washington added. His boycott had been criticized for being planned too quickly; King\u2019s is planned for three months in the future.</p> <p>One of their intentions with the stay-at-home boycott, McCullough said, was safety. \u201cWhen we\u2019re out in the streets, and we\u2019re protesting and marching, our people are still getting injured, they\u2019re still getting killed, they\u2019re still getting incarcerated,\u201d she said. \u201cOur thinking was it doesn\u2019t make any sense for us to be out here and protesting, then paying bail. It\u2019s the same as saying you\u2019re supporting the same system you\u2019re fighting against.\u201d Of the protests that have broken out around the country, many have been peaceful though there have been outlying moments . Last week, in North Carolina, one person <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2016/09/21/us/charlotte-police-shooting/\">was fatally shot</a> during a protest in Charlotte.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/isaiahwashington46/posts/10209300323361707?pnref=story\">On Facebook</a>, Washington elaborated the event on 26 September was merely \u201cPHASE I\u201d, and mentioned there will be a \u201cBusiness Target\u201d day in October. He advertised a second boycott for 7 November, which McCullough explained was planned by a group called Moving Forward. They would also be supporting King\u2019s boycott in December, McCullough said.</p> <p>McCullough, who started #Missing24 after the death of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/14/philando-castile-funeral-minnesota-police-shooting\">Philando Castile</a>, said she was inspired by reading about boycotts that happened in Zimbabwe and Sudan. In the US, boycotts of the shopping holiday Black Friday <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/nov/26/ferguson-protesters-police-brutality-black-friday-boycott\">began in 2014</a> after the death of Michael Brown, through campaigns or groups like <a href=\"http://www.notonedimeboycott.com/\">#NotOneDime</a> or <a href=\"http://www.blackoutforhumanrights.com/about-blackout.html\">Blackout for Human Rights</a>, a \u201cCollective of Filmmakers, Artists, Activists, Musicians, Lawyers, Tastemakers, Religious Leaders and Concerned Citizens\u201d, though it\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/07/your-money/elusive-effects-of-the-black-friday-boycott.html\">unclear if they made an impact</a>. That Black Friday boycott <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/nov/27/notonedime-black-friday-protest-african-americans-boycott-shopping\">continued in 2015</a>. Groups called for boycotts of businesses <a href=\"http://www.wafb.com/story/32401824/group-asks-public-to-boycott-some-baton-rouge-businesses\">in Baton Rouge</a> after the death of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/07/alton-sterling-death-ive-been-sick-ever-since-they-murdered-him\">Alton Sterling</a> and <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/video/national/calls-for-charlotte-boycott-after-police-shooting/2016/09/21/339cfb1c-8014-11e6-ad0e-ab0d12c779b1_video.html\">in Charlotte</a> and <a href=\"http://www.citizen-times.com/story/news/local/2016/09/26/black-lives-matter-group-calls-economic-protest/91117962/\">Asheville</a>, North Carolina, after Scott\u2019s death. Other groups have called for only buying from black-owned businesses or keeping money in <a href=\"http://blackoutcoalition.org/\">black-owned banks</a>.</p> <p>Washington\u2019s original post announcing the boycott received 28,000 shares on Facebook, but it\u2019s difficult to determine how many participated. Some expressed their support on social media using #StayAtHomeSeptember262016. McCullough said people from almost every state participated, most hailing from New York, California and Texas. Students at Reed College in Portland, Oregon, peacefully held signs and drums as they walked through different buildings on campus in solidarity with the movement, <a href=\"http://koin.com/2016/09/26/reed-college-students-boycott-class/\">KOIN6 News</a> reported.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/02/alicia-garza-on-the-beauty-and-the-burden-of-black-lives-matter\">Alicia Garza on the beauty and the burden of Black Lives Matter</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The boycott also had its critics, with some saying it was too quickly planned or that some couldn\u2019t afford to skip work. \u201cIf you can\u2019t afford to skip work, don\u2019t. Boycott in other ways,\u201d Washington said on Wednesday. \u201cI\u2019m not some wealthy jerk who is telling people to lose their jobs.\u201d Others brought up past remarks made by the actor, who currently stars on the TV show The 100 and was a recurring character on Grey\u2019s Anatomy from 2005 to 2007. The public speculated that the controversial remarks caused the actor to be removed from the latter show. When asked to address those critics, Washington said, \u201cThis is about life, liberty and freedom under the constitution of the United States of America. It\u2019s not about me.\u201d </p> <p>King\u2019s boycott was planned with a nod to boycotts of the past, occurring on 5 December, \u201cthe same date that our ancestors began the 381 day long Montgomery Bus Boycott. It is going to take that same type of determination and organization for us to actually make this boycott count\u201d, he wrote in <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/injusticeboycott/posts/897245660408832\">a message</a> to the more than 75,000 people who had signed up thus far. The Montgomery bus boycott began in 1955 and ended with a supreme court declaration that segregated buses were unconstitutional. He also took inspiration from the treatment of North Carolina in light of their <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/apr/01/north-carolina-transgender-bathroom-law\">transgender bathroom law</a>.</p> <p>So far, King has released a basic framework for what he hopes his boycott will look like, with targeted boycotting of brands, institutions, cities and states tied to specific reforms. He hopes millions will eventually participate.</p> <p>While Washington\u2019s #StayAtHomeSeptember262016 was for one day, King thinks his should be in addition to the protests and rallies around the country. He intends for it to last indefinitely, until reforms are made, which he admittedly thinks will take a while. \u201cThe United States right now is very resistant to change and very resistant to change on a number of issues, not just racial violence and police brutality,\u201d he said.</p> <p>But that doesn\u2019t mean King doesn\u2019t have hope, both that a boycott will be effective and be an answer for those he worries are hopeless, wondering what they can do.</p>",
  "<p>When British Airways announced earlier this week that it was reducing the number of meals provided to passengers on some economy flights and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/sep/29/british-airways-marks-and-spencer-sandwiches-economy-short-haul-flights\">providing the opportunity to buy M&amp;S sandwiches instead</a>, one or two commentators deplored the change. But, in general, the news was greeted with a collective sigh of relief by a travelling public increasingly ground down by the indignities of air travel.</p> <p>I have a dirty little secret about airline food. I love it. I know of other foodies who so loathe the whole business that they now travel with smug little hampers of goodies so they can wrap themselves in a pashmina, turn on the expensive headphones and bury themselves in a private world of airborne luxury. But I can\u2019t go that way.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/sep/29/british-airways-marks-and-spencer-sandwiches-economy-short-haul-flights\">British Airways ditches free meals on short-haul flights for M&amp;S food</a> </p> </aside>  <p>There\u2019s always been something incredibly exciting about communal eating while mashed into a seat and surrounded by the detritus of inflatable neck cushions, headphone cables, magazines and books. Long, long before hipster chefs were selling meat that had been cooked fashionably low and slow, cabin crew with fireproof legs and plastic smiles were serving chicken-or-beef that had spent most of a day being cooked, sealed, transported and stored. </p> <p>Before <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2011/dec/14/slow-roasted-rib-of-beef-with-bone-marrow-sauce-recipe\">Heston</a>, if you wanted a cut of beef cooked for 24 hours at 56.6C, you had to take a DanAir flight to Gran Canaria. And there\u2019s just something so modern, so sci-fi about getting a whole meal, in compartments, on a plastic tray. Even today, when the sealed, reduced-salt, allergen-cleansed meal pod is passed down the aisle, it feels like something an astronaut might eat, with the design aesthetic of a Bento box.</p> <p>This is not, I\u2019m relieved to say, a solitary passion. Kevin English, a contributor to <a href=\"http://airlinemeals.net/\">airlinemeals.net</a>, where inflight food lovers can post pictures of their meals with accompanying comments, takes a similar view. \u201cI think it goes back to the romance of travel,\u201d he says. \u201cMy father was an expat and I remember travelling back to England regularly on BOAC in the 70s. </p> <p>\u201cTravelling was more inaccessible then and the food and nice service were exciting. Even today I think people find travel boring, the experience of checking in, security and boarding can be frankly unpleasant, so once they sit in the seat the inflight meal is one of the highlights of the journey.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s long been believed that altitude somehow affects the tastebuds and that airline food is specially flavoured to overcome this. Sadly, says Prof Barry C Smith at Centre for the Study of the Senses at the University of London, this isn\u2019t quite right. The tongue itself is unaffected but \u201cwhite noise (like the sound of engines) in the ears makes the brain detect less salt, sweet and sour from the tongue by about 15%\u201d. So do the airlines alter the menu to compensate?</p> <p>\u201cLufthansa seem to know,\u201d says Smith. \u201cThey give their business class passengers noise-cancelling headphones \u2026 for a better taste experience.</p> <p>\u201cDry air and high altitude or low pressure make it less easy to smell our food, so that reduces enjoyment, but we can overcome this a little with more spices because they engage a different system \u2013 the trigeminal nerve, which makes peppermint taste cool in the mouth and mustard taste hot. That\u2019s why BA used to give people more curries at the back of the plane.\u201d That is, in economy class.</p> <p>But the umami flavour is immune to this effect, says the professor, \u201cwhich is why you should drink bloody marys on a plane\u201d \u2013 and perhaps why my memories of some of those long-simmered, rich-gravied braised meats have stayed with me so much longer then the bleach-flavoured salads or the styrofoam rolls.</p> <p>Menus from the great historical airships occasionally crop up at auction, revealing a degree of luxury that diminishes today\u2019s business class by comparison. These flights were intended to compete with the great transatlantic liners, then at their apogee, and so offered breakfast, lunch and dinner with consomm\u00e9s, French sauces, souffl\u00e9s, fresh coffee and fruit, all presented by silver service waiters in mess jackets.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e200069713526d6db8c427fb889652feb353fdfd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e200069713526d6db8c427fb889652feb353fdfd/0_62_3962_2377/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A British European Airways steward balances a tea tray as she serves passengers, 1947.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A British European Airways steward balances a tea tray as she serves passengers, 1947.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Merlyn Severn/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The first meals on passenger planes are thought to have been served by the Handley Page Transport company in 1919, flying from Hounslow Heath aerodrome in London to Le Bourget, Paris.

The national flag-carrier companies, in particular, took every opportunity to show the world their best. </p> <p>An Air France menu for the Paris-New York run in 1964 offers a starter of caviar and then a choice between \u201caiguillette de caneton Montmorency,\u201d \u201cgigue de chevreuil \u2018grand veneur\u2019\u201d and \u201csupr\u00eame de volaille \u2018Coq Hardi\u2019\u201d \u2013 an enviable spread by today\u2019s standards, though I\u2019d pay folding money to see today\u2019s cabin crew serving it with silver spoon and fork over the heads of screaming kids in cattle class.</p> <p>Today, if BA is guessing correctly, it looks like the glory days of airline food are behind us. They can\u2019t see a reason to keep up the pretence, and perhaps I should be happier to let it go.</p> <p>At one level, airline food is purely functional. If humans are going to be confined in a metal tube for eight or more hours at a time, then certain biological needs must be met. Over the years, though, airlines have invested the in-flight meal with much more. Planes are one of the vanishingly few public spaces in which a class system is still rigorously enforced rather than hidden. The difference in price between a first and an economy class ticket is vast and, as all passengers arrive at exactly the same time, in exactly the same place, and equally clobbered with jetlag, extraordinarily difficult to justify on any rational economic grounds. </p> <p>Given the limited number of services an airline can offer to passengers strapped into seats, food became one of the most important signifiers \u2013 the best opportunity to remind people of their place, and to justify what they\u2019d paid for it. It\u2019s an intriguing thought that, as more and more passengers bring their own in-flight entertainment in the form of laptops, smartphones and tablets and the airline has lost another opportunity to stratify the offering, perhaps lowering the standards of economy is the only way left to maintain ticket class differentials.</p> <p>Much has changed in airline catering. A rise in economy class flying by both business and leisure flyers has meant that costs have been cut to the bone. Outside the rarified \u201cfront end\u201d of the plane, behind the curtain, tiny economies in large numbers of cheap meals can have a proportionally higher greater effect on profitability.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"c03891a1757aeb8c5547cb390cd4518c157bf731\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c03891a1757aeb8c5547cb390cd4518c157bf731/480_0_2424_3029/800.jpg\" alt=\"An airline serving trolley stacked with food.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">An airline serving trolley stacked with food.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Antonio Olmos/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Many of the prestigious catering operations that once served the flag carriers have separated from their parent companies and now supply high volumes of economical ready meals in an international market worth millions per year. LSG Sky Chefs, originally the catering backbone of Lufthansa and Gate Group, originally Swissair\u2019s chefs, are the two biggest players in the game; whoever you fly with, you\u2019re likely to see one or other of their trucks backing up to your aircraft. </p> <p>The kitchens, though, which once served their finest in a grand gesture of national pride, are now undifferentiated feedmills for the herds in transit. And the shape of the meal has changed. Fears around terrorism after 9/11 have removed anything like proper eating utensils from circulation in the cabin, meaning that anything that\u2019s not a finger food or effectively a packaged snack can\u2019t be served. Increased sensitivity to allergies among fliers mean that food is laden with disclaimers and warnings, giving it all the delicious appeal of a shrinkwrapped bio-hazard.</p> <p>Passengers\u2019 expectations have collapsed as flying becomes more common and as no-frills airlines make a benefit out of highly visible cost-cutting. The industry has got itself into a weird, self-destructive loop, a race to the bottom in which, if a passenger in an economy-class seat actually receives something decent to eat and which isn\u2019t charged for as an extra, they will think they\u2019re somehow getting ripped off.</p> <p>Finally, the airports themselves have upped their game. Once, there was only a joyless institutional airside cafeteria where you could sit under a striplight and drink plastic coffee while lovers bid tearful goodbyes and lonely business travellers drowned themselves in canned lager. Now that international legislation has robbed duty free of its financial advantage, the airports have concentrated on feeding travellers. </p> <p>The food court at an international airport today is a high-function holding pen that might have been designed by Temple Grandin to stall the milling mass of humanity and strip them of cash in exchange for glittering, recognisable high street food brands. It\u2019s hard to imagine anyone wanting an economy inflight meal if they can get their favourite fast food or gourmet sandwich at only marginally hiked prices, just a shuttle short of the gate.</p> <p>Kevin English sums it up ruefully. \u201cWe just have to accept that the days of a free hot breakfast on the 7am to Glasgow are over. Catering is a cost centre and airlines have to turn it into a revenue stream. Something\u2019s got to give.\u201d But, for a privileged few, he believes, there\u2019s still hope. \u201cMany airlines are putting more effort into their premium cabins \u2013 first and business class.\u201d</p> <p>So, perhaps those irritating foodies have a point. Maybe next time I should just go where the inevitable pressures of science and economics are guiding me. I\u2019ll get some noise-cancelling headphones so I can taste the bloody mary in my Thermos and, buried in my smug little hamper, wrapped in a linen napkin to incubate it at a steady warm temperature, I\u2019ll put a piece of beef I\u2019ve braised for something like a week, some over-stewed carrots and a kick-ass gravy, in a tinfoil tray, with a cardboard lid.</p>",
  "<p>I was recently sent an article published by the UK\u2019s Mail Online with the eye-catching headline: \u201c<a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3784171/Brutal-Central-African-dictator-rules-country-iron-fist-allegedly-skins-enemies-alive-eats-testicles.html\">Brutal Central African dictator who rules his country with an iron-fist and \u2018skins enemies alive and eats their testicles\u2019</a>\u201d.</p> <p>At first I thought it was a bad joke. But it wasn\u2019t. I was shocked that a mainstream news organisation in a developed country could use such an unbalanced, ill-informed and prejudiced headline in its reporting of an African country \u2013 in this case, Equatorial Guinea. I thought the United Kingdom, where I have many friends and enjoy visiting, had progressed beyond racism but clearly many of its institutions, including the Daily Mail website, are struggling to update their view of the world, much as the African country in the article is struggling to transition to democracy. </p> <p>During my years at the UN and as minister of foreign affairs for Somaliland, I regularly faced the challenges of transitioning African states and the constant need for better governance. It is a sad reality of my continent but understandable as it pulls itself along this new road. Africa was given democracy before the foreign ink drawing out our borders had dried. In short, the desire for democracy in its broadest forms was created in a vacuum. The institutions of state necessary to drive, foster and protect democracy were not yet formed. Democracy in African states today is still in relative infancy. The international community understands this and needs patience with it.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/sep/26/south-africa-saving-endangered-species-duty-everyone\">South Africa: 'Saving endangered species is the responsibility of everyone'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It is fair for the Mail Online to call for more democracy in Equatorial Guinea. That\u2019s what the international community, the people of Equatorial Guinea and indeed all African governments, want. At no point does the Mail Online contain a response from the President\u2019s office to these allegations as it should do for balanced and non-prejudiced reporting.</p> <p>A state must progress according to its circumstances and culture if the foundations are to last and democracy is to flourish. I am not being an apologist for African leaders, or President Teodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasogo in particular, but my point is that while progress needs accelerating, we must approach the issue with a sound, informed understanding and be willing to hold out our hands to help a country along the path to democracy.</p> <p>In my opinion, western media reporting of African governments is often ignorant over facts and coloured by a post-colonial view of the region, bordering on racism. </p> <p>The Mail Online report\u2019s main source is Severo Moto, who it describes as a rival. It does not tell the reader that Moto is accused of breaking international law in supporting and fomenting a failed coup in 2004, organised by British financiers and <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/4169557.stm\">involving Sir Mark Thatcher</a>, the son of former prime minister Margaret Thatcher. </p> <p>President Obiang is not alone in being targeted in this way. Sooner or later most African presidents come in for this kind of treatment, often by journalists who still seem to think of Africa as a continent populated by savages. They fail to understand the challenges facing Africa\u2019s modern leaders, who have worked to leave this kind of nonsense behind in the interests of creating lasting legacies for their people.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/healthcare-network/2016/sep/14/uk-charities-send-recycled-prosthetics-africa\">'Back on my feet': how artificial limbs can have a second life in Africa</a> </p> </aside>  <p>I first visited Equatorial Guinea in the early 1990s when the UN building was little more than a temporary hut surrounded by lush rainforests and accessed by dirt roads.

  "<p>The story of Alicia Machado is many things but as it pertains to the presidential election, it is a story about the time Donald Trump smeared a woman and riled up a media circus to spread the gossip. That was back in the 1990s and mostly fodder for tabloids. Now it\u2019s happening all over again \u2013 only as part of a presidential campaign.</p> <p>In the first candidates\u2019 debate this week, Hillary Clinton invoked her opponent\u2019s high-profile fat-shaming of Machado after she was crowned Miss Universe in 1996, comments that pushed her into a downward spiral of eating disorders for five years.</p> <p>Until recently Trump wasn\u2019t denying any of it \u2013 when the New York Times first asked Trump to respond to her story, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/15/us/politics/donald-trump-women.html?_r=0\">he replied simply</a>: \u201cTo that, I will plead guilty.\u201d But on Wednesday, his campaign released talking points <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Acosta/status/781265558721458177?s=09\">claiming the story was</a> \u201ctotally baseless and unsubstantiated\u201d and that Machado was merely attempting to \u201cgain notoriety at the expense of Mr Trump\u2019s name and reputation\u201d.</p> <p>The irony of course is that we can verify Machado\u2019s story not in spite of Trump but because of him. It was he who made sure her weight-gain and his treatment of her was documented around the world; what\u2019s changed is simply public perception.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/sep/27/alicia-machado-trump-miss-piggy-latino-campaign-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/55vjz\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2756157\"            data-video-name=\"Former Miss Universe Alicia Machado on Trump: 'I know what he can do' - video\"            data-video-provider=\"The Guardian\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-57ea8d3fe4b091b7fa2b5a86\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=11572839&amp;format=video/mp4\"/><source src=\"https://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=11572839&amp;format=video/m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=11572839&amp;format=video/3gp&amp;maxwidth=700\"/><source src=\"https://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=11572839&amp;format=video/3gp&amp;minwidth=700\"/><source src=\"https://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=11572839&amp;format=video/webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/sep/27/alicia-machado-trump-miss-piggy-latino-campaign-video\">Former Miss Universe Alicia Machado on Trump: \u2018I know what he can do\u2019</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>Back in May, Slate\u2019s Jessica Winter published a <a href=\"http://www.slate.com/blogs/xx_factor/2016/05/17/when_donald_trump_humiliated_miss_universe_for_gaining_weight.html\">roundup</a> of the media\u2019s cruel and inappropriate coverage from the time, much of which laughed right along with Trump: \u201cNo one could accuse Alicia Machado of being the size of the universe,\u201d wrote a CNN correspondent at the time. \u201cBut as her universe expanded, so did she.\u201d And while the media may have since advanced on the subject of fat-shaming \u2013 it\u2019s no longer acceptable to write about young women\u2019s weight that way \u2013 we\u2019re still falling for Trump\u2019s sensationalized media circuses.</p> <p>This time the line of attack, pushed most aggressively by surrogates and rightwing news outlets, defames Machado as a porn star and murder accomplice, who once threatened to kill a judge and posed topless for Playboy, among other things. The latest assault came from Trump himself on Friday. He called her \u201cdisgusting\u201d on Twitter and asked followers to \u201ccheck out sex tape and past\u201d. Even if the worst of this is true, it doesn\u2019t invalidate anything she said about Trump.</p> <p>The real headline should be \u201cWoman Who Speaks Truth About Presidential Candidate Endures Second Character Assassination\u201d. The sequence is familiar by now: throughout history, women who speak out against powerful men \u2013 as Machado did, for instance, <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/15/us/politics/donald-trump-women.html\">in the New York Times earlier this year</a> \u2013 have been subject to a backlash. They\u2019re slut-shamed or cast as crazy, as the Anita Hill movie, Confirmation, recently <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/apr/15/hbo-confirmation-anita-hill-clarence-thomas-jill-abramson\">reminded us</a>. </p> <p>Instead the Daily Caller went with \u201cPorn Star Campaigns For Hillary Clinton,\u201d while the Daily Mail <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3810484/Miss-Universe-fat-shamed-Donald-Trump-accused-threatening-kill-judge-accomplice-MURDER-native-Venezuela.html\">landed upon</a> \u201cMiss Universe \u2018fat-shamed\u2019 by Donald Trump was accused of threatening to kill a judge and being an accomplice to a MURDER bid in her native Venezuela,\u201d noting that it was \u201cunknown if [the] Clinton campaign vetted Machado\u201d. Alex Jones\u2019s conspiracy-theory-mongering site also speculated luridly about the father of Machado\u2019s daughter\u2019s past.</p> <p>First off, the Clinton campaign confirmed to the Guardian that she is not being paid by them. She\u2019s a volunteer.</p> <p>The pornography charge appears to be false. The website Snopes, which specializes in debunking online hoaxes, writes that the anal sex clip that turns up on free porn sites under Machado\u2019s name appears to be from the 2004 feature Apprentass 4, which stars another woman. Machado did pose on the cover of Playboy \u2013 twice in fact. But if it\u2019s going to be used to smear her character, perhaps it\u2019s relevant to note that so has Donald Trump? The difference is Trump kept his shirt on, but even that was probably only in deference to the preferences of the audience. And speculation relating to her seven-year-old daughter should not be a journalistic enterprise at any respectable media organization.</p> <p>The most substantive charge is that in 1998 a 21-year-old Machado was accused of driving a getaway car after her boyfriend shot his brother-in-law. This is from <a href=\"http://www.economist.com/node/604213\">the Economist</a>\u2019s report at the time:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The male lead in this complex plot is Miss Machado\u2019s rugged boyfriend, Juan Rafael Rodriguez Reggeti. He had a sister, who, eight months pregnant, jumped off a fifth-floor balcony. He, allegedly, blaming her husband for the suicide, sought revenge by firing two shots at him just after the funeral. The husband was hit but survived. Mr Rodriguez fled in a car driven, say the police, by Miss Machado.</p> <p>The investigating judge, Maximiliano Fuenmayor, issued an arrest warrant for Mr Rodriguez. But Miss Machado, who claimed she was ill at home at the time, seemed to be in the clear, for the moment anyway. It was a short moment. Within hours, Mr Fuenmayor had a telephone call from her. He says she threatened to ruin his career and have him killed. She admits she rang, but says it was merely to thank him for his unbiased pursuit of justice.</p> </blockquote> <p>The accusations went nowhere and she never faced charges. The report that she drove a getaway car was dropped almost 20 years ago due to lack of evidence. More recently, they did not prevent her from obtaining US citizenship in August, a process involving a background check and clearance.</p> <p>Interestingly Corey Lewandowski, the Trump operator <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2016/09/alicia-machado-attempted-murder-228885\">who dredged up the allegations</a>, was charged with battery as recently as this year. And unlike, Machado, who has only volunteered, the former campaign manager was, <a href=\"http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/onpolitics/2016/09/29/donald-trump-pays-off-corey-lewandowski/91262286/\">until Thursday</a>, still on Trump\u2019s payroll.</p> <p>Machado\u2019s role in the debate has also spawned <a href=\"http://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2016/9/27/13079878/alicia-machado-trap\">claims</a> that a profile I wrote was orchestrated with the Clinton campaign.</p> <p>To be clear: it was not. I never communicated with the Clinton campaign around this story except to ask for a comment on Monday afternoon, <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.politico.com/media/story/2016/09/after-debate-cosmo-guardian-us-rushed-to-publish-dueling-alicia-machado-profiles-004785\">as Politico explained.</a></p> <p>Given a chance to respond to the personal accusations about her, Machado \u2013 whose English is imperfect \u2013 did not debunk them as forcefully as she might have (though again, she has been denying them for almost 20 years now). Instead <a href=\"http://www.mediaite.com/tv/fmr-miss-universe-machado-on-allegation-she-was-a-murder-accomplice-im-not-a-saint-girl/\">she said something different,</a> and something which has been largely misconstrued. After dismissing the reports as \u201cspeculation\u201d born of her celebrity in Latin America she waxed indignant: \u201cHe can say whatever he wants to say, I don\u2019t care,\u201d she said. \u201cYou know, I have my past. Of course, everybody has a past. I\u2019m not a saint girl. But that is not the point now.\u201d</p> <p>Trump\u2019s campaign has latched on to this as evidence of her guilt. But perhaps there\u2019s been something lost in translation. Trump said at the debate that she\u2019s \u201cno Mother Teresa\u201d and here she\u2019s echoing Trump\u2019s implicitly sexist line from the debate. Mother Teresa is an actual saint \u2013 she shouldn\u2019t have to be.</p> <p>Let\u2019s assume for a moment that the worst is true and she threatened a judge as a 21-year-old: it doesn\u2019t make Trump look any better.</p> <p>You shouldn\u2019t have to be Mother Teresa to not be fat-shamed before millions of people. And Michael Brown being \u201cno angel\u201d, as <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.latimes.com/opinion/opinion-la/la-ol-ferguson-michael-brown-angel-20140828-story.html\">the New York Times put it recently</a>, shouldn\u2019t have been relevant in a case about being killed by police, as Black Lives Matter tried to teach us.</p> <p>These instances aren\u2019t equivalent, but the point is people who lack power because they are women or minorities, or both, too often aren\u2019t given the basic human dignities the rest of us take for granted.</p> <p>Machado saying she\u2019s no saint isn\u2019t an admission of guilt. It\u2019s an indictment of us. </p>",

Their capital costs are put at \u00a3395m, plus a capital cost of \u00a3469m for the AWPR. <br></p> <p>Gardner said the unexpected capital charge caused a direct reduction in the cash available to ministers in Edinburgh for other projects. In order to make up for other shortfalls, they also had to: release contingency funds for the new Firth of Forth bridge, currently behind schedule; reduce planned loans to Scottish Water, which is publicly controlled; and postpone uncommitted grants.</p> <p>In a parallel development, the Scottish government is drafting new legislation to prevent future borrowing for new social housing being put on the public accounts after social housing debt also ran foul of the same EU regulations. </p> <p>The ONS said on Thursday that \u00a34.5bn worth of Scottish housing debt counted as public debt, as did such borrowing in Wales and Northern Ireland. The move follows a similar ruling for English social housing borrowing made last year. </p> <p>The Treasury has told Scottish ministers that \u00a34.5bn will not be added to the Scottish government books. Officials in Edinburgh admitted, however, they did not yet know whether the ONS would agree that the new legislation would satisfy the EU regulations.</p> <p>Gardner said that overall the Scottish government\u2019s accounts, which covered total spending of \u00a337bn, were healthy and well-managed.

Corbyn's mentor helped build a myth that the party had betrayed socialism and was just the same as the Tories.

How can you win? You put white thing women in an advert, you're not representative (true). You put a diverse range of women in an advert, you're pandering. True, there was something a bit tokenistic about the campaign, and they could have maybe done it a bit more subtly than having a bunch of &quot;diverse&quot; women in one advert saying &quot;see how diverse we are???&quot; <br />Then again, you have to start somewhere. If this signals a change in H&amp;M's advertising that includes more diversity in all of their media going forward, then I'm in. Let's just see if they carry it forward.<br />Oh and on the unrelated paragraph about portraying mixed race couples - I had no idea it produced such backlash. I am a product of a mixed marriage myself, so I am frankly just bemused at furious reactions over mixed marriages and relationships. They've been a fact of life for thousands of years and have been increasingly common and will only get more common as air travel and multi-culturalism increases. I'm not even offended, I just find it highly amusing that there are still people out there who honestly believe that &quot;mixing&quot; is wrong.

I've worked at several agencies and can tell you from experience that the problem is not down to gender imbalance (though this is definitely the case at the very senior levels). Nor is it necessarily down to a lack of ethnic diversity (though this still has a long way to go). In my opinion, the problem is down to these agencies insisting that they generally hire privately educated individuals with degrees. This means that my colleagues are effectively homogenised in their views and experiences. How then, is it possible for them to create ads which resonate with society at large, when they only hire individuals who have been living in a lovely middle-class bubble their whole lives? A lot of the products we make ads for would never be bought by such people. Rather, it's those in the council estates that flock to buy them en masse. And the disconnect between what they want, and what a lot of my colleagues think they want, is marked.</p></div> </div> </div>  </figure>  <h2>\u2018This is just the voice in the doorman\u2019s earpiece saying, \u2018It\u2019s a flat night, let the people in we wouldn\u2019t last night\u2019.\u2019</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-comment\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/28/hm-advert-diversity-ad-women#comment-84234753\">  <div class=\"d2-comment-embedded\" itemscope itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Comment\"> <div class=\"d2-left-col\"> <a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/16541740\" title=\"View ID665310\u2019s profile\"> <img class=\"d2-avatar\" src=\"https://avatar.guim.co.uk/user/16541740\" height=\"40\" width=\"40\" alt=\"User avatar for ID665310\"> </a> </div> <div class=\"d2-right-col\"> <div itemscope itemprop=\"author\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\"> <a class=\"d2-username\" href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/16541740\" title=\"View ID665310\u2019s profile\" itemprop=\"url\"> <span itemprop=\"givenName\">ID665310</span> </a> </div> <div class=\"d2-permalink\"> <a class=\"d2-datetime\" href=\"https://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/84234753\" title=\"Link to this comment\" itemprop=\"datePublished\">28 September 2016 6:01pm</a> </div> <div class=\"d2-body\" itemprop=\"text\"><p>Okay, I've watched it.

She responds to the question \u2013 why are women more affected?</em></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Women have always felt more comfortable coming forward and I don\u2019t think men self-harm as much. Instead, they tend to turn to other things to ease their distress, such as alcohol. That\u2019s why it\u2019s important to have gender specific services. We are seeing more women with post traumatic stress disorder from domestic violence, after childbirth and from sexual violence they experience in relationships. Those sort of conditions need a different approach to ones we have as standard at the moment.</p> <p>Similarly with men a different approach is also needed, and for them we need to make services and treatment accessible. We know that middle-aged men have the highest suicide rate, so what are we doing to get that group into treatment and support earlier. It\u2019s good that we have identified these new statistics as if we know about these problems then we can plan services better and think, why is this happening? </p> <p>Mental health problems are increasingly (there\u2019s lots of reasons for this). I worry, in particular, about the impact of the media and social media. People are seeing things like self-harm on social media dn it makes it more accessible and we need to be really alert and able to talk to our children. We need to have that conversation around those issues and make sure they are safe. </p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-09-30T13:41:29.230Z\">at 2.41pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57ee3b0de4b035c40686bf13\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/joanna-ruck\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-30T13:29:14.557Z\">2.29pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Pictures of the week</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><em>Picture editor Joanna Ruck shares some of her images of the week.</em></p> <p>First, the images from Aleppo have been particularly hard to look at this week and very graphic and distressing.

I don't like voting because of a party leader but jeremy &amp; those around him don't appeal to me either. </p> <p>I think this will be one of their problems come election time if things don't change - they paint anything tory as evil (despite tories winning more votes than labour) &amp; they need tory votes to win anything. If they could just stop the tory-bashing &amp; actually get on with policy, they might get a better message across the divide. They need to start saying how they are similar, not how they are different (although this will alienate momentum et al.)</p> <p>What I really fear though is all those right-leaning labour voters, who tend to be socially right-wing, voting UKIP. UKIP are already on-course to win more votes despite the referendum &amp; any equivocation from the tories or labour (which has already happened to a greater extent) on leaving EU &amp; they'll push more &amp; more to UKIP. Lib dems are a non-starter as corbyn has sapped any hard-left votes that may have gone their way. That leaves UKIP as the 3rd largest party in the HoC (future HoL?!) &amp; they'll likely vote tory on many issues in the house.

He didn't get any advantage from so doing - except I suppose to wrong foot others.</p> <p>Worst worst worst - terrible person.</p> <p>He was also a control freak and would get really furiously angry if he thought someone wasn't fully in agreement with him. And you would have thought that all those traits would damage him and his career but it just didn't really seem to (I left obviously) but he seems to have continued on through life - lying and distorting and screaming at people (NO, he is not Donald Trump!) perfectly successfully in some ways.</p> <p><br />Terrible, terrible, terrible person but could really suck up to someone when he wanted and put on this super-friendly facade. Ugh! Never again would I ever want to have to work in the same environment as someone like that.</p></div> </div> </div>  </figure>  <h2>\u2018I am spending this evening applying for another job\u2019</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-comment\" data-canonical-url=\"https://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/84174883\">  <div class=\"d2-comment-embedded\" itemscope itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Comment\"> <div class=\"d2-left-col\"> <a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/12302423\" title=\"View Petrichoria\u2019s profile\"> <img class=\"d2-avatar\" src=\"https://avatar.guim.co.uk/user/12302423\" height=\"40\" width=\"40\" alt=\"User avatar for Petrichoria\"> </a> </div> <div class=\"d2-right-col\"> <div itemscope itemprop=\"author\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\"> <a class=\"d2-username\" href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/12302423\" title=\"View Petrichoria\u2019s profile\" itemprop=\"url\"> <span itemprop=\"givenName\">Petrichoria</span> </a> </div> <div class=\"d2-permalink\"> <a class=\"d2-datetime\" href=\"https://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/84174883\" title=\"Link to this comment\" itemprop=\"datePublished\">27 September 2016 9:56pm</a> </div> <div class=\"d2-body\" itemprop=\"text\"><p>&quot;8.

  "<p>The colonisation of space might just be humankind\u2019s most ambitious undertaking, a great reach for the stars. According to Guardian cartoonist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/tom-gauld\" title=\"\">Tom Gauld</a>, it could also be pretty boring. <em>Mooncop</em> follows a nameless lunar officer of the law as he takes a loitering girl home to her dad, follows a lost dog, and attempts to reason with a malfunctioning automaton. This is a colony in inexorable decline, a half-forgotten, underfunded dream no one wants to live in any more. <em>Mooncop</em> is a slight tale, but Gauld\u2019s deceptively simple panels and sparse, understated dialogue speak poetically about the deadening monotony of jobs and the pointlessness of existence. This is life lived in a literal bubble of oxygen-rich air, and a metaphorical bubble of computerised bureaucracy. Yet this land of plains and craters, marked by prefabricated lodges on stilts and biospheres of trees and bins, has a real and stark beauty. <em>Mooncop</em> is touched by nostalgia for the golden age of space exploration and an affection for the routines of small-town life, and Gauld finds humour and hope \u2013 as well as coffee and doughnuts \u2013 in his portrait of a fading utopia. <strong>James Smart</strong></p> <p>\u2022 <em>Mooncop</em> is published by Drawn &amp; Quarterly.

The US is home to 5% of the world\u2019s population, but 25% of the world\u2019s prisoners. One in three young black men in the US today can expect to serve time in prison during their life. The prison population has grown exponentially since the 1980s-era war on drugs began in earnest, ballooning from a few hundred thousand to over two million today, with black people heinously overrepresented among them.</p> <p>But DuVernay\u2019s 100-minute voyage through the legacy of the criminalization of black Americans does more than rattle off statistics. Weaving a historical narrative from slavery through the present, the film and its contributors trace in stark relief, the various transmutations that the oppression of the black body in America has taken, and the ways that criminal justice has been recruited to that end.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V66F3WU2CKk\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/V66F3WU2CKk?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>Michelle Alexander, author of the bestselling book The New Jim Crow, explains in the film how in the post-civil war south, petty offenses were used to recapture newly freed blacks and force them into free labor under convict lend-lease programs that functionally reconstituted chattel enslavement. Indeed the film\u2019s title is drawn from the caveat in the 13th amendment, presumed to guarantee freedom for enslaved blacks, but also legalizes the slavery and involuntary servitude of convicted criminals.</p> <p>The film winds from this early postbellum era through the extrajudicial lynchings of blacks in the early 20th century, through resistance to the civil rights movement and finally the war on drugs. All these mutating forms of racial control were premised at least in part, the film suggests, on white notions of black criminality. Every time the word is uttered in the film, no matter the historical context, it appears on the screen in bold white on black text to highlight this connection. </p> <p>DuVernay said the film was conceived around the idea of telling the story of how privatization and profit drove much of the expansion and development of mass incarceration. \u201cThere is a really clean clear line of the black body being used for profit and for politics.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/jun/06/ava-duvernay-los-angeles-film-festival\">Ava DuVernay: 'This patriarchy is often shocked when a black film does well'</a> </p> </aside>  <p> \u201cBut as we started working on the film we quickly realized in order for that to really pack a punch you had to understand the historical and cultural context,\u201d DuVernay said.</p> <p>A number of high-profile criminal justice reform advocates, like New Yorker columnist and UConn professor Jelani Cobb, former Obama adviser Van Jones and civil rights icon Angela Davis lend their voices to the film, along with some seemingly less likely figures.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d53ff8475ceb4689a884ecb6acdee8c02c252376\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d53ff8475ceb4689a884ecb6acdee8c02c252376/11_0_638_383/500.png\" alt=\"A still from 13th.\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A still from 13th.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Netflix</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Republican Newt Gingrich and conservative anti-tax crusader Grover Norquist also make appearances, in part highlighting the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/oct/01/sentencing-reform-bill-criminal-justice-congress-critics\">bipartisan consensus that has begun to built around issues of criminal justice reform</a>\u2013 but also, according to DuVernay, some of the points of disagreement which still exist, and some of the potential land mines.</p> <p>\u201cI wanted to explore the question of why all this bipartisanship now \u2026 and we found a surprising answer that may not necessarily be positive,\u201d DuVernay said.</p> <p>Lingering on the American Legislative Exchange Council (Alec), 13th looks hard at how corporate interests have shaped public policy on criminal justice, and adapted to developments in the national consensus on crime and punishment.

The target date is now the end of 2018.</p> <p>Over the past 20 years, the NTSB has listed the lack of positive train control as a contributing factor in 25 crashes.

Eight people were killed.</p> <p>In 2011, a Port Authority Trans-Hudson or Path commuter train crash in a separate section of the Hoboken station injured more than 30 people. The NTSB found the engineer failed to control the speed of the train as it entered the station and investigators also determined a contributing factor was the absence of positive train control.</p> <p>\u201cThey\u2019ll have to answer for themselves, but at the end of the day if safety is job one \u2026 then you have to have a better record than New Jersey Transit has right now,\u201d said New Jersey senator Bob Menendez, noting that the transit agency said in a 2016 Federal Railroad Administration report that it did not have positive train control on any locomotive or segment of track.</p> <p>\u201cThat means zero across the board,\u201d he said. \u201cThey need to do better than zero across the board.\u201d</p>",

Investigators came across the paintings in a building that they were searching after a judge last week ordered the seizure of the gang\u2019s assets. They also seized a small plane. </p> <p>\u201cWhen we finally found them, we did not believe our eyes,\u201d a local official told La Repubblica. </p> <p>The FBI considered the 2002 heist one of the \u201ctop 10\u201d art crimes, <a href=\"https://www.fbi.gov/investigate/violent-crime/art-theft\">according to its website</a>.

It was the home of Assunta Maresca, known as Pupetta, who was a former beauty queen, convicted murderer, and Camorra boss described as a trailblazer and suffragette in the syndicate.</p> <p>Unlike the highly organised Sicilian mafia, the Camorra is an \u201carchipelago of gangs\u201d, Dickie said, with some branches being more sophisticated than others.</p> <p> \u201cIt is easy to say the Camorra did it and then jump to the conclusion that the Camorra is moving into the art market,\u201d Dickie said.</p> <p>He said the discovery and the alleged involvement of the Camorra reflected the opportunistic nature of the Neapolitan syndicate. Its members spend a lot of time in prison and are part of a vast underworld network in which illegal goods are sold and traded.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t think we need to conclude that it\u2019s the Camorra boss who is putting this art on his mantelpiece. A lot of times these people don\u2019t have a lot of class [and] they wouldn\u2019t necessarily be impressed by having this,\u201d Dickie said.</p> <p></p> <p>Federico Varese, an expert in criminology from Oxford University, said it was unsurprising that the discovery exposed a link between Amsterdam and the Camorra, given the Dutch city\u2019s reputation as a major drug hub. Cross-border investigations dating back to the 1980s had found the presence of the Camorra in Amsterdam.</p> <p>\u201cWhat I know for sure is that a lot of <em>camorristi</em> are in Amsterdam, not because they want to be rooted there or deal in racketeering of shops or that kind of thing, but because they are there to buy drugs. Amsterdam is a hub for the buying and selling of illegal goods,\u201d Varese said.</p> <p>The Italian prime minister, Matteo Renzi, informed his Dutch counterpart, Mark Rutte, about the police operation before the funeral in Jerusalem of the former Israeli leader Shimon Peres. Renzi also tweeted a message of thanks to Italian law enforcement, saying he was proud of their work.<br></p>",

The future art star enrolled in <a href=\"http://www.calarts.edu/about/history/chouinard\">Chouinard Art Institute</a>, later known as CalArts, and studied under people like <a href=\"http://www.pacegallery.com/artists/211/robert-irwin\">Robert Irwin</a>. Along with many of his classmates, he felt trapped within the confines of the prevalent form at the time, abstract expressionism, but was inspired by the works of <a href=\"http://www.jasper-johns.org\">Jasper Johns</a>, who seemed to be pointing in a new direction. </p> <p>\u201cIt was like a reversal, a pulling away from them and going for things that were common objects, the common objects that had been ignored for so many years,\u201d Ruscha recalls of the evolving scene that led to his first show, one that put him on a stellar trajectory. \u201cIf you go back and look at <a href=\"http://www.theartstory.org/artist-de-kooning-willem.htm\">Willem de Kooning</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theartstory.org/artist-kline-franz.htm\">Franz Kline</a>, two of the artists that were embracing abstract art, non-objective art, in a big way, and at the same time, in their life they appreciated Cadillacs and modern life, the whirl of modern life, the action behind it, the mechanisms.\u201d</p> <p>Just two years after graduating Chouinard, his work appeared in the pivotal 1962 show, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Painting_of_Common_Objects\">New Painting of Common Objects</a> at the legendary <a href=\"https://blogs.getty.edu/pacificstandardtime/explore-the-era/locations/ferus-gallery-2/\">Ferus Gallery</a>, putting him in the company of future stars like <a href=\"https://lichtensteinfoundation.org\">Roy Lichtenstein</a> and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Warhol\">Andy Warhol</a>. A year later, Ferus gave him his first solo show and he unofficially joined the gallery\u2019s cool club, including people like <a href=\"https://billyalbengston.com\">Billy Al Bengston</a>, <a href=\"http://www.theartstory.org/artist-kienholz-edward.htm\">Ed Kienholz</a> and <a href=\"http://www.kenprice.com\">Ken Price</a>. </p> <p>Pop Art was born and Ruscha was directly in its midst. He made his first sale to a gallery regular, actor <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000454/?ref_=fn_al_nm_1\">Dennis Hopper</a>. \u201cIt was quite a surprise when he bought that picture of the gas station of mine,\u201d Ruscha laughs. \u201cIt stayed with him, I think, until he got his divorce from his wife and then he lost it.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s not clear why text has played such a prominent role in his work since the beginning, but it might have something to do with his early experience at Plantin Press, where he learned about handset type, followed by a job at an ad agency called Carson/Roberts, where he learned layout and graphics. Critics and academics have sparred over the meaning of the words, and Ruscha says he hopes his art leaves people scratching their heads, but there\u2019s nothing vexing about the text in Extremes and In-betweens. Whether it\u2019s a painting called Years, Months, Weeks, or another called Tril, Bil, Mil, there\u2019s something reassuring about the logic and order of Ruscha\u2019s words set against sprawling, neutral-toned backgrounds. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"907b66a7971f759b44e51addb77743cfac05c53c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/907b66a7971f759b44e51addb77743cfac05c53c/0_0_3000_1762/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ed Ruscha Universe with Wrinkles, 2016 Acrylic on canvas, 72 x 124 inches 182.9 x 315 cm\" width=\"1000\" height=\"587\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ed Ruscha, Universe with Wrinkles, 2016.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ed Ruscha/Courtesy of Gagosian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>What\u2019s missing from the large-scale works is the nostalgia of previous series like 2005\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.tfaoi.com/aa/6aa/6aa74.htm\">Course of Empire</a>, where he reimagined the buildings in his earlier Blue Collar series, or his photos comparing the views from his Western Avenue studio in the early 60s to today. Nostalgia does seep into the four smaller works, familiar mountain views, each bordered by an iris, a technique borrowed from early cinema and hinting at the role movies have played in Ruscha\u2019s work throughout his career. </p> <p>\u201cShowing work in a gallery is not an easy thing to do cause you\u2019re kind of like putting yourself out there,\u201d he says, giddy and a little nervous as the London exhibition approaches. \u201cBut I\u2019ve been doing it for quite a while. And it\u2019s a task, but it\u2019s a wholesome kind of task. You just do these things cause they sort of come naturally.

I don\u2019t know really what the hell I\u2019m up to.\u201d </p> <p>That may be true, but the 78-year-old veteran artist sounds pretty sure of himself. \u201cThere\u2019s no master plan or agenda or anything, really, and getting to the end result can sometimes be arbitrary.

  "<p>In early August when I heard that Lowell Goddard had chosen to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/aug/04/dame-lowell-goddard-resigns-as-head-of-child-sexual-abuse-inquiry\">step down from the child abuse inquiry</a>, I literally started to cry. That she initially resigned without any explanation made it even worse. It was a sharp shock. Survivors of sexual abuse are used to the world opening up underneath their feet and dropping down into nothingness, and that same feeling of upset returned to me from over 30 years ago when I heard the news. The chaos, rumours, resignations and industrial-strength ineptness that have both preceded Goddard and, more disconcertingly, followed her exit \u2013 culminating this week in not only the departure of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/sep/28/ben-emmerson-counsel-child-sexual-abuse-inquiry-sacked-concerns-over-leadership\">Ben Emmerson QC</a> but also his deputy <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/elizabeth-prochaska\">Elizabeth Prochaska</a> \u2013 have left me with just a single question: what the actual fuck is happening here?</p> <p>The key issue for me, and probably for most of the survivors who this inquiry was designed to give a voice to, is one of trust. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/29/theresa-may-child-abuse-inquiry\">Theresa May fought for this inquiry.</a> She fought for us. Back in July 2014 when she announced it as home secretary, you could almost see the eye-rolling going on among certain Tory party members. Yet, to her immense credit, she persevered. And then came the catalogue of mistakes, disasters and obstructions that, to all but the most naive of us, simply scream cover-up.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/sep/30/what-next-for-child-abuse-inquiry-after-lead-counsel-suspension-ben-emmerson\">What next for the child abuse inquiry after its top lawyer\u2019s departure?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>I don\u2019t like the term \u201cvictim\u201d. I prefer \u201csurvivor with shrapnel\u201d. And speaking as one of those survivors, let me make it clear that even more debilitating than the physical pain of abuse, is the loneliness: for a child who is suffering sexual abuse, fear, when coupled with exhaustion, leads to indescribable isolation. Family members are often the worst people to speak to (in many cases they are the perpetrators, or they are aware of what is happening and are doing nothing), and there is often no one else to turn to. Even if there is a friendly teacher, the fear of what will happen if you speak out is invariably greater than the courage it takes to do so.</p> <p>Because that\u2019s what paedophiles do. They terrify, they manipulate, they threaten and they find a thousand different ways to tell their prey to shut up. And so, when a prominent member of government commits to something as big and far-reaching as this inquiry, it counts. It counts as much as anything has ever counted. It is an absolute, ringing endorsement that shouts out to the world, \u201cWe hear you, we believe you and we will do all we can to make this right.\u201d <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/jul/07/may-child-abuse-inquiry-maximum-transparency\">May herself said</a>: \u201cWhere there has been a failure to protect children from abuse, we will expose it and we will learn from it.\u201d</p> <p>And Christ do we need words like that and the actions to back them up. We live in a country where a primary school teacher can walk into a classroom, see another teacher raping a seven-year-old girl, quietly close the door and leave them to it, and she can do this without committing a crime because we are one of the only countries in the world that does not have mandatory reporting (if you\u2019re anything like me you will refuse to believe this until you research it, and then you\u2019ll likely want to throw up in disgust).</p> <p>In 2014-15 there were <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/jun/22/nspcc-nhs-open-refuges-support-child-victims-sexual-abuse\">47,000 recorded sexual offences against children in the UK</a>. This is the highest number of offences in a decade. The discovery rate of child abuse is between 5% (according to the NSPCC) and 12.5% (the children\u2019s commissioner 2016 report). So the real number will be much higher.</p> <p>The opportunity for good that this inquiry proffered was extraordinary. To give a voice to the hundreds of thousands of people (some of whom have survived, some of whom didn\u2019t make it, most of whom have survived to simply exist rather than to live) is a profoundly humanitarian and kind thing to do. It engenders trust in a group of people for whom trust is an almost unthinkable concept. And yet when many of these survivors are prepared, finally, to dig deep, open their mouths and speak out, they are met with an incompetence, mistrust, abandonment and rejection that is as appalling as it is consistent.</p> <p>It has to stop. May, in an even better political position now to fight for this inquiry, needs to do more for all of us. Break it down into manageable pieces if necessary: the sheer bloody necessity of it having such an immense scale should horrify us all. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2016/sep/30/michael-mansfield-willing-to-replace-emmerson-child-abuse-inquiry\">Hire Michael Mansfield</a> if necessary, hire 100 Michael Mansfields. Offer them every possible resource, make things completely transparent and reassure us that no matter how long it takes and no matter the cost, this inquiry will happen, accountability will be sought, and we will learn from our mistakes. And then put those same exact resources into today\u2019s child protection services to ensure that, for once, there is a chance that \u201cnever again\u201d really means \u201cnever again\u201d.</p> <ul> <li><em>Comments for this article will be pre-moderated prior to publication</em><br></li> </ul>",
  "<p>Channel 4\u2019s decision to take on the Great British Bake Off from the BBC is a story about Channel 4\u2019s remit, the BBC\u2019s failure to agree a deal with format owners and originators Love productions to the comings and, mostly, goings of the talent, in media terms this remains a huge story. In many respects it\u2019s one both C4 and the BBC would rather sort of went away.</p> <p>For C4, there remains just too many uncomfortable questions about their \u00a375m raid on a format that is a) already a huge success on another public broadcaster, and b) is about as quintessentially \u201cBBC\u201d as you can get.</p> <p>Which, if you\u2019re Channel 4, with a remit to be innovative, edgy, different, to serve audiences not well catered for elsewhere \u2013 as that remit says \u2013 and above all <em tabindex=\"-1\">not</em> to be the BBC, is pretty tricky. So tricky that the almost dead issue of C4\u2019s potential privatisation has been given a new lease of life.</p> <p>For the BBC, under continuing financial pressure and political manouvering aimed at securing ever greater regulatory oversight of the corporation\u2019s activities and notwithstanding its new draft charter, the corporation looked like the victim of an unfair fight with another public broadcaster. Which in political and PR positioning terms is not a bad place to be \u2013 especially if you\u2019re an organisation more used to being regarded as too big, powerful and mighty.</p> <p>So, all the more surprising then that the BBC\u2019s director of strategy and education, James Purnell, and C4\u2019s chief creative officer had such a personal and explosive row about the matter at this week\u2019s Royal Television Society conference. The arguments were reasonably familiar from both sides, with many in the industry remaining sceptical of C4\u2019s case. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/sep/13/sue-perkins-and-mel-giedroyc-to-leave-great-british-bake-off\">Sue Perkins and Mel Giedroyc to leave Great British Bake Off</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Yet the timing was particularly poor for the BBC, as it served to highlight another issue which has nothing to do with television, namely radio. Specifically, who will take control of the BBC\u2019s radio directorate when current director Helen Boaden retires.</p> <p>BBC director general Tony Hall\u2019s plan is to add responsibility for radio to Purnell, whose lack of significant content experience is seen as a barrier to his chance of succeeding Hall to the top job. But there are two problems with thisplan.</p> <p> First, as a former Labour government minister \u2013 a fact Purnell introduced in his row with Jay Hunt to give weight to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/sep/27/channel-4-bake-off-privatisation-bbc-c4-james-purnell\">his contention that C4\u2019s move made privatisation politically more likely</a> \u2013 he would have effective control over and responsibility for a significant element of coverage, likely to be an issue for many Conservative MPs.</p> <p>Second, with the exception of a brief spell with a small independent production company, Purnell has no editorial experience to speak of and certainly none of actually running a TV or radio network. Which was a point made very strongly by Hunt in support of her argument with Purnell over Bake Off.</p> <p>It can\u2019t have been welcome for Purnell himself to open these issues up to wide public view, especially just the day after Boaden confirmed her imminent departure from the BBC. Which may explain why Hall so conspicuously failed to back Purnell\u2019s comments about C4\u2019s raid on The Great British Bake Off.</p> <p>After the row, Hall is left hoping he can get away with appointing a former Labour minister to a top content job in charge of all the BBC\u2019s radio networks. While Channel 4 is left hoping no one cares enough about anything they do to make an issue out of how taking a hit show from BBC1 squares with their remit.</p> <p>Neither of which would seem especially great outcomes.</p> <blockquote> <br> </blockquote>",

So, if some performers were scheduled for one number or two numbers, a choice had to be made.</p> <p>When that great, pounding rhythm on Mannish Boy started up, I certainly did go into a panic. As Jonathan remembers, I didn\u2019t know the song\u2019s alternate title: like a lot of people my age, I was still learning my way through the blues by way of rock and roll.

My producers, Jonathan included, guided me in the selection of which songs to shoot. It was decided that we would shoot Caledonia and sacrifice Mannish Boy.

A fact like an actor\u2019s date of birth stands in the way of our dreams at some point in all our working lives \u2013 we\u2019re no different from anyone else in this \u2013 but it\u2019s notoriously true that actors contend with age in unequal ways. Without a doubt, since I\u2019ve left my twenties the roles have become more interesting. Maybe that\u2019s just art reflecting life. Young men are never as interesting as they think they are. Demetrius is no match for Helena, Lysander for Hermia, nor that dolt Romeo for the wry and cogent Juliet.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/sep/26/law-passed-enabling-actors-to-remove-age-from-imdb\">Law passed enabling actors to remove age from IMDb</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Roles for older women, if they reflected life, should be the stuff of great drama. I think of my mother for whom a whole shadow life came into light after she was widowed. Meanwhile the men of her corresponding age began to run out of steam. Those subjects remain rare in the stories we tell ourselves. Perhaps that is an emphasis that goes back to the earliest stories.</p> <p>I like watching actors as they grow old. The best and most generous actors show us, without vanity, what Philip Roth called the \u201cmassacre\u201d of old age. I think of great performances from Vanessa Redgrave in Atonement, Julie Christie in Away From Her, Emmanuelle Riva in Amour. Jason Robards in Magnolia. Peter O\u2019Toole in Venus and My Talks with Dean Spanley \u2013 where he found an eerie translucence as though one foot was in the afterlife. I was lucky to work with Michael Gambon on Churchill\u2019s Secret in which he portrayed a stroke-stricken Churchill as though in his second childhood. </p> <p>There\u2019s a distinction between the way age is treated in films, television and the theatre. Hollywood has always framed desire as something for the straight and the young \u2013 or young women, at least. Bacall was 19 to Bogie\u2019s 45 in To Have and To Have Not. But Bacall was smart, in control, Alpha \u2013 an adult. As were Katharine Hepburn, Claudette Colbert, Rosalind Russell, Barbara Stanwyck, Bette Davis. The conclusions of their films usually required a man to complete the picture but you sometimes wonder where that combination of humour and strength has gone now that we\u2019re so baby-ish. But there\u2019s a whole raft of women working hard in Hollywood who are in their late forties. Things are growing up.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/jan/06/luise-rainer-remembered-patrick-kennedy\">My friendship with Luise Rainer: art, advice, Einstein and champagne</a> </p> </aside>  <p>An actor once described to me a very famous male star now in his late seventies: \u201c\u2018I call him <em>Norman</em> Desmond,\u2019 she said, \u201che\u2019s got a loooong staircase.\u201d Well, most actors haven\u2019t had to descend from the heights of that actor\u2019s beauty, or suffered the waning of our star at the lonely end of Sunset Boulevard like the original Norma, so our vanity should be less of an issue. We work far away from what David Thomson called \u201cthe great cabinet of desire\u201d that is Hollywood and our youthfulness as it pertains to fantasy is not a very important factor. We hope to reflect life \u2026 in all its baldness. But we\u2019re never quite out of the shadow cast by the American dream factory and its conservative standards.</p> <p>In Hollywood a whole parasitic community sprung up around these images \u2013 doctors and quacks given over to the pursuit of youthfulness and its corollary, health. That economy is going strong. The parochial preferences of age-leery, surgery-happy west Angelenos, whose nipping and tucking begins to look normal through the windscreen of a tinted Lexus, becomes a global standard for us all to worry over.</p> <p>As any Hollywood agent will tell you, something else is changing too. The men are getting as much \u201cwork\u201d as the women. And once the inventory of Californian narcissism has been exhausted \u2013 the grapefruit oil, spirulina, brain dust, activated dingleberries, diet pills, coke, bulimia, fake pregnancies, and the surgeon\u2019s knife \u2013 there\u2019s the guaranteed-youthfulness-or-your-money-back cure of early death.</p> <p>Somewhere in Hollywood, the middle managers are adding up the numbers, and the market, they calculate, demands youth. But as the US population ages that\u2019s bound to change. The older demographic will assert their buying power. This has already started to happen in television which, for all its formulae and cliche, reflects the lives we lead so much better than the American cinema now does. Will the power of these storytelling industries make age less important? Will age become as fluid as sexuality and gender?</p> <p>Instinctively, I welcomed the news that a new California law will require IMDb to omit or remove age and birth date from an actor\u2019s profile upon request. Publishing actors\u2019 ages on the internet just provides another impediment to the imagination. Agents find it unhelpful. For actors it\u2019s an unwelcome intrusion \u2013 limiting the range we suppose we have, counter to the spirit of self-invention. But the idea that \u201cage doesn\u2019t matter\u201d cuts both ways. The law, which applies only to California, would seem to compound Hollywood\u2019s prejudice rather than remove it. If it doesn\u2019t matter, why hide it? I suspect that most of the time we\u2019d like to fool ourselves as much as anyone else.</p>",

  "<h2>Dandelyan, Blackfriars</h2> <p>Dandelyan is one of <a href=\"http://www.worlds50bestbars.com/fifty-best-bars-list/dandelyan/?pid=ranking-2015-1-50\">the world\u2019s 50 best bars</a> and one of my personal favourites. With a menu that explores modern botany, this could easily be a pretentious place of moody mixologists. It is not \u2013 these are bartenders, skilled in the art of hospitality, as well as drinks creation. This place has thought about all aspects of the bar experience. The decor is plush but not to the point you look yourself up and down before entering. Being part of the boutique hotel Mondrian London means there is sense of charm and elegance rather than overbearing luxury. The cocktail classes flock to see the concoctions of famed drinksmiths Ryan Chetiyawardana and Iain Griffiths, but thanks to its location, inside one of London\u2019s coolest hotels, and on the South Bank, it attracts a wide range of customers. The modern-botany focus narrowed this January to \u201cthe effect botany has had on historical civilisations\u201d. If you\u2019re of a curious disposition, you\u2019ll be drawn to the cocktails with esoteric descriptions. The Pinnacle Point Fizz stands out: tequila, mixtamalised blue corn, sloe, ginger bitters, sour pineapple and soda. Too safe? How about Heirloom, with whisky, Kamm &amp; Sons, plant haemoglobin and exploded raspberry cordial. Up a notch? The 13<sup>th</sup> Century Boy has gin, palm and pine embalming cordial and mummified citrus. Like natural science, somehow the elements neatly weave together.<br>\u2022 <em><a href=\"http://dandelyanbar.com/\">dandelyanbar.com</a>.

But this cool little coal hole of a place breaks the mould. It groups its whiskies \u2013 250 of them, from around the world \u2013 by flavour rather than country, so choosing is easy, and most drams, apart from a few rarities, are \u00a37-\u00a311. The Japanese-influenced cocktails are excellent too, with beautiful ice, prepared by staff who really know their stuff (but don\u2019t indulge in jargon). And the table is show-stopping \u2013 an 18ft slab of oak tree with channels of whisky flowing through it. Black Rock is whisky made fun.<br>\u2022 <em><a href=\"http://www.blackrock.bar/\">blackrock.bar</a>.

This is the kind of place you can come to have a sensible chat with a colleague over a Black Cow vodka and tonic at the gold bar; for a sexy date with someone new or someone you love (most couples seem to end up snogging on the sofas); for an experimental whisky cocktail; or to get sloshed on a round of signature Hix Fixes with some pals. Come on a Thursday after 10pm for the regular Mark\u2019s Lates party and you\u2019ll end up dancing until 3am (and watching bartenders dancing on the bar). After all that, it\u2019s standard practice to come upstairs for air and wonder where the hours have gone.<br>\u2022 <em><a href=\"http://www.hixrestaurants.co.uk/restaurant/marks-bars/\">hixrestaurants.co.uk</a>.

There\u2019s just this kebab shop upstairs then, next to it, there is this well-presented guy on the door \u2013 there\u2019s nothing else to look at. To go for the first time, especially if you\u2019re taking someone who\u2019s never been, is special \u2013 but you really should book in advance. Walking down the stairs through a long thin corridor and into that bar for the first time is amazing. It\u2019s a dark space, with candles everywhere. It has this beautiful tin ceiling that reflects light beautifully. Waiters will greet you, and they know the menu inside out. The menu changes regularly and the drinks are bespoke, but you can\u2019t really go wrong: the waiters push you in the direction of how you\u2019re feeling. The Nightjar changed the game a bit, with that seated cocktail dining experience with live jazz and swing in the background. The atmosphere when the music is peaking is dark and sexy and I can\u2019t think of another bar that goes to so much effort in the presentation of every single drink in its list.

It\u2019s that moment that takes you from being a stranger in a strange place to a welcomed guest, waiting for a drink. Even when it\u2019s three deep at 69, there will always be someone who works there whose eyes go directly to the door when it opens. 69 is a tiny, tucked-away bar lifted out of a Fellini film. Inside, there\u2019s black wood, white-jacketed staff \u2013 and a relaxed elegance. If I pop in on the early side I\u2019m sure to run into a mix of artists and writers, some of the designer friends of Tony Conigliaro \u2013 its owner \u2013 as well as high-end bartenders from around the world who make pilgrimages to the bar to experience Tony\u2019s drinks. 69 has been influential on the cocktail bar scene. It was one of the earlier bars to take a chance on stepping up into higher-end cocktailswhen there was this change from people looking for the place that gave you the biggest drink to the place that gave you the best drink. I loved the Lipstick Cocktail and the Fig leaf Martini, where Tony distils fig leaf into the spirit. The Caper leaf Martini is also gorgeous.

Trailer Happiness attracts an excellent crowd and does the best rum cocktails in London. It\u2019s a great bar to visit with a group of friends or even when travelling solo. It\u2019s been an institution for many years and is known for its adoration for my favourite spirit: rum. That\u2019s not to say itdoesn\u2019t do a killer G&amp;T or vodka Martini, but the highlights and more innovative cocktails on the menu are usually rum-based. During Notting Hill Carnival, the team can be found cooking up jerk chicken and serving it alongside delicious rum punches. Trailer Carnival Lockdown is my favourite party, and where I can be found with a punch cocktail in hand. My favourite night at Trailer had to be after Imbibe Live 2013 (an annual drinks trade show). I had just found out that I had been offered the job at OXO Bar and Restaurantand I remember it was an extremely hot day. Many faces from the bar trade were at Trailer after the Imbibe show and we had an amazing night. The atmosphere, the drinks and the people absolutely made the evening. I felt like I was on a Caribbean Island with all of my best mates \u2013 and it\u2019s where I met my boyfriend. But, honestly, no matter what time of year it is, a night in Trailer can transport you to a party in Barbados \u2013 until closing time anyway.<br>\u2022 <em><a href=\"http://www.trailerhappiness.com/gallery.html\">trailerhappiness.com</a>.

Nobody goes to a bar to have a bad time. Loads of places do it extremely well, but none, in my opinion, more so than the Sun Tavern. The owners will probably tell you different, but my take on it is that this place is a modern-day version of a pub. The decor is tough to pin down to one particular style, but it feels like a pub should feel. Homely, welcoming and reliable, along with one of the best-looking back bars in London; the days of Fosters on draught and a dusty bottle of Cointreau on the back bar are dead. The Sun has a great selection of beers on tap, which change regularly, a short, but very well put together list of house cocktails and staff as knowledgable on classic cocktails as anywhere else in London. You\u2019ll find me working my way through its extensive selection of Irish whiskeys.<br>\u2022<em> <a href=\"http://www.thesuntavern.co.uk/\">thesuntavern.co.uk</a>.

As soon as you go in, you find yourself buying into the whole thing and that\u2019s what great bars do. It\u2019s themed around blitz-chic and is designed with a high level of authenticity: down to the staff talking in received pronunciation. It\u2019s all been thought through so wonderfully; the way the staff dress, talk, the theatre of the entrance \u2013 as if being ushered into a bomb shelter. Part of the bar is in what used to be the Kingly Court tube station, so I think that\u2019s where it got some of its theme from. The drink menus come on a kind-of 1940s-style newspaper, but it has serious people in charge of its bar programme; there\u2019s been an effort to hire people who see making drinks as an artform. Products are chosen carefully, there a lot of homemade ingredients and the owners spend time and effort on the presentation and garnishing. But really it\u2019s just a lot of fun.

  "<p>I\u2019ve always liked Will Self, one-time literary <em>enfant terrible</em>, TV talking head and all-round perspicacious hypersesquipedalianist. I know it\u2019s probably not alright to like Will Self any more. He\u2019s almost certainly not cool. It\u2019s likely he\u2019s said things on Twitter I can\u2019t be bothered to Google that have angered people or displayed incorrect ways of thinking, sparking one of those wild sprawling waves of self-nourishing social media rage, the smartphone generation\u2019s equivalent of going to a massive rave in a field.</p> <p>I still like Will Self, though. Not so much the recent Will Self, who has wise, weary opinions about politics. But old Will Self from the 1990s who, in a strange time of plastic prosperity and glossy consensus, when everyone seemed happy to be brayingly cool and British and pleased with themselves, still managed to be wild and censorious about everything in a way that looking back now seems about right. That was a great Will Self. I don\u2019t want him to do podcasts and have opinions about Trident. I want him to smoke crack on Newsnight and tell Evan Davis he\u2019s a refulgent ganglion of the news\u2011argument ziggurat, or do poppers and kidnap Nigel Farage as part of an art happening.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/sep/30/premier-league-10-things-to-look-out-for-this-weekend\">Premier League: 10 things to look out for this weekend</a> </p> </aside>  <p>All of which brings us naturally on to Chris Sutton, fellow curmudgeon and all-round speaker of nostril-quivering truth, who is right now the hottest football pundit on TV. Sutton was everywhere this week. He\u2019s everywhere most weeks, the most distinctive, excitingly vinegary voice in football\u2019s massed commentariat.</p> <p>The Sutton Supremacy has come in a rush. It has been a takeover by stealth for a pundit who until this season was another background voice, honing his craft in the backwaters of BT Sport\u2019s SPL coverage. An excellent and underrated player in his time but otherwise just another presence around the plinth holding a mic and frowning respectfully while Steve McManaman says something about game awareness or going beyond the last man.</p> <p>No longer. Sutton is everywhere now, and so absorbingly astringent on every topic it\u2019s hard to imagine how we all managed to carry on with our everyday lives before he started popping up calling everything pathetic and abject and embarrassing. It is a familiar process now, a degree of fluent, unself-conscious disdain that leaves you nodding impatiently through the other stuff about moving the ball quicker and building the team around what Wayne can still do, just waiting for the moment the presenter finally says: \u201cChris. Thoughts?\u201d</p> <p>Cue Sutton, sucking his cheeks in, a man with the curt, brutishly disappointed look of a Cambridge-educated assistant games master who once played hockey for England but now finds himself reduced to disciplining adolescents for acts of depravity in the junior boarding house. Sutton pauses. He looks bored, sad, nobly demeaned. Finally in a strangled voice he says: \u201cAbject.\u201d Or maybe: \u201cWoeful.\u201d Or: \u201cDesperate, Gary.\u201d Dismal. Entropic. Wearisome. Inauspicious. Degenerate. Unpropitious. I have of late, wherefore I know not, lost all my mirth. Man delights not me. No, nor woman neither. Chris Sutton, thanks for that.</p> <p>This kind of cinematic miserablism isn\u2019t a new thing. Jimmy Hill made his name as a nay-sayer and nit-picker right back at the start of all this. Alan Hansen was thrillingly dismissive in his own glory days, the drunken vampire years when the idea of someone lolling back on a pouffy sofa and saying \u201cunbelievable\u201d still seemed quite bracing and punk. Roy Keane does a fine line now in violently curdled fury.</p> <p>I also like Craig Burley who, like Sutton, appears to feel himself besieged on all sides by wickedness and mediocrity, growling into the camera with uncontained rage, like the owner of a successful firm of city centre bailiffs explaining in sarcastic, hate-filled detail the relevant provisions of the Tribunals Courts and Enforcement Act as he backs you up against the living room wall, knuckles tightening around the cosh in his right hand.</p> <p>The best thing about Sutton is he\u2019s completely natural with it. This is not an act or a persona, to the extent we must assume he\u2019s spent the last 15 years of relative obscurity sitting around at home looking magisterially pained, or saying things like \u201cwoeful\u201d and \u201cabject\u201d as he trails around the shops on a Saturday afternoon.</p> <p>And really, authenticity seems to be the point here. Punditry itself is ludicrously prominent these days, a function of a sport that simply never stops, that must happen all the time even when it\u2019s not really happening at all. Football is more than ever an assault on the emotions, yanking at your arm, making demands, jangling away at your finer feelings.</p> <p>This is a drowned world, a place where even small-fry corruption has become an arm of the entertainment, where an England manager en route to Qatar and Russia is derailed for the crime of simply reflecting the curdled culture from which he was plucked. And where the brilliance of the spectacle, the basic pleasure of gawping at these impossibly bright lights comes with a constant drip of confusion and compromise.</p> <p>It is only natural to crave a corrective voice in this nepotism of nastiness, a razor to cut the fluff. During the great military parades in ancient Rome, victorious generals would have a slave posted next to them to whisper about their failings and say things like \u201cremember, you are just a man\u201d. Hail the sofa curmudgeon. Abject. Desperate. Hapless. Woeful. Yes. Yes, more. More of this.</p>",

Until government forces began a siege in July, vital supplies filtered in and out, residents could visit friends or even leave if they wanted to. Some stayed out of loyalty, others for desperation or fear of life as a refugee in squalid camps.</p> <p>Among the factions fighting in the city are hardline Islamists, including a group formerly linked to al-Qaida. But east Aleppo is also still home to artists and moderate activists, including women who work in its charities and schools.</p> <p>A new term had been due to start on Saturday, but classes have been suspended indefinitely in the face of last week\u2019s unprecedented bombing campaign on the city, which the UN\u2019s chief humanitarian officer described as a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/29/aleppo-syria-war-humanitarian-crisis-un\">\u201cterrible descent into the pitiless and merciless abyss\u201d</a>.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/30/syria-un-aid-convoys-more-than-four-fifths-blocked-delayed-september\">More than 80% of UN aid convoys in Syria blocked or delayed</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The siege is also biting hard.

My children were terrified and started to cry and shout. There was some damage to the doors and windows of our apartment from the blast, but I managed to calm them down then I made some coffee to drink with my husband and calm myself down.</p> <p>The boys were hungry, but we had no bread, just some pasta and an onion, which I cooked up for them. They begged me, \u201cPlease mum, stay with us, don\u2019t go out in case the plane comes again.\u201d</p> <p>There is a hospital near our home and when they heard the ambulances arriving they started crying again, and asking if there were children or old people or women injured. They can see the casualties from our window.</p> <p>I was working as a teacher in intermediate school before the war. We were a normal family, we would go around the city, to parks, to restaurants to relax. But I was arrested after the revolution, and my family had to pay a lot of money to get me out of jail and so I haven\u2019t gone back to the regime side for five years.</p> <p>I run a school, so before this siege I would go there every day with my sons, who are 10 and 12, they would study and play with the other students, then we would come home, make dinner, watch TV together.</p> <p>But the bombing is intense now, targeting everything: schools, hospitals, mosques. Two of the teachers, my friends, were killed and another injured in his leg and hands when they were walking to school.</p> <p>So for now the school is shut, a few teachers go there to prepare things, in case the atmosphere improves and we can open again.</p> <p>In the morning when the planes come we all go to the shelters, we spend most of our time there and it is so boring, there is nothing to do, no electricity, no fuel for the generator.</p> <p>There are so many difficulties. I can\u2019t tell you what its like when my son says \u201cI am hungry\u201d and I don\u2019t know what I can prepare for him. Last week was his birthday and he cried all night because we couldn\u2019t make him a cake.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8d9050c4370f2f407809a0106557ae8d3e4b2c17\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8d9050c4370f2f407809a0106557ae8d3e4b2c17/0_358_675_405/500.jpg\" alt=\"Afraa\u2019s son\u2019s birthday party\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Afraa\u2019s son\u2019s birthday party, without cake.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Afraa Hashem</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The children remember their friends who have left or died, their relatives who are abroad, they make models of them from paper and talk to them as if they are still here. I listen to my boys telling them stories about their lives.</p> <p>Sometimes they come to school with me, see it is empty and say: \u201cWhen will classes start?\u201d I\u2019m thinking if the atmosphere gets better, we will take them out to paint murals on some of the cars and buses damaged by the bombing.</p> <p>Even though we are suffering a lot, and alone, we are happy, because we are fighting to get our freedom. I hope even if I die, my children will grow up in a free and safe country. I want you to ask the world, don\u2019t send food to us, but prevent the regime from killing us.</p> <p>Most of my family are in Turkey, but one brother is here and I work with him. We set up the school together, and I work with psychological support for the children, and for the women who need support, who lost their husband, or sons by the war.</p> <p>Our school is in an underground shelter now, but I can still see when the children arrive with their school bags, there is happiness in their eyes, they are excited to study.</p> <h2><strong>The taxi driver: Abo Awad</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2a7945d124d49e479eb22f93915ae6ec59ae819a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2a7945d124d49e479eb22f93915ae6ec59ae819a/0_356_581_349/500.jpg\" alt=\"Abo Awad a taxi driver in eastern Aleppo\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Abo Awad: \u2018All the news I hear is that someone else has been killed.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Hussein Akoush</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>We don\u2019t sleep well as the jets are always overhead, they wake me up early although I try to ignore the sound.</p> <p>If we have water, I perform an ablution before my morning prayer, and if not I go to the nearby mosque with a bowl to get some water. There are usually a handful of people there doing the same.</p> <p>There is no electricity, so it\u2019s dark inside the apartment, but my wife is usually up when I get back and we take the chance to talk before the children are awake.</p> <p>One of the best sounds of the morning is my neighbour turning on his generator, although its just for two hours to save fuel. We all meet to charge batteries and phones, and talk about events in Aleppo and the bombings overnight with a cup of tea.</p> <p>When I come home, my children are getting up. The first thing one of them said to me yesterday was: \u201cThank God we are still alive.\u201d</p> <p>I go out for bread, and just get one bag with eight pieces, which is only enough for a single meal. We are a large family: me, my wife and 11 children. It\u2019s a poor and unhealthy breakfast, bread with maybe some tomato paste, olives and tea, but we finish it all.</p> <p>I have diabetes and kidney problems, and my wife has rheumatism and back problems, but we cannot get the medicines we need, not even painkillers. The supplies I collected when the siege was broken last month have run out.</p> <p>We are from a village near al-Bab which is under Isis control now. I used to be an accountant for the Syrian army, but I left the job in 2011 and went to work as a taxi driver in Aleppo. We have no income now. My taxi was smashed in an airstrike and there is no fuel here these days anyway.</p> <p>If it\u2019s a quiet morning, I go out to walk, but Aleppo is a deserted city now. There are no people or cars on the streets, all I see is the wreckage and debris and all the news I hear is that someone else has been killed, or there is a massacre in the next neighbourhood.</p> <p>When jets are overhead we go down to basement in our building, where children and women begin to scream and cry and men are also afraid, especially after the use of bunker-buster bombs. We feel we are waiting for death.</p> <p>Every day, we receive text message from the Syrian army saying things like: \u201cThe ceasefire deal didn\u2019t last, Americans and Turks didn\u2019t abide by terms of the agreement\u201d and \u201cIf you want the reconciliation and peace then you must raise the flag of the Syrian Arab Republic.\u201d</p> <p>We skip lunch to save food, and in the evening use old furniture and other wood for cooking rice or bulgar wheat. There is no power or internet connection, it is strangely quiet under the LED bulbs of our battery torches.<br></p> <p>It feels like we are in a prison, a really big but claustrophobic prison. And we stay in this mood until we go to bed around 10 or 11 and try to sleep. It\u2019s an unbearable situation.</p> <h2><strong>The aid worker: Zein al-Sham</strong> </h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"ee4fb4b4b0589aecb02493d1385224c1cb0be8fe\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ee4fb4b4b0589aecb02493d1385224c1cb0be8fe/68_263_814_1017/800.jpg\" alt=\"Zein al-Sham.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Zein al-Sham: \u2018I try to comfort them, although inside I am also afraid.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Hussein Akoush/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I wake up early.

I got involved in anti-regime activism in 2012 when I was doing my undergraduate degree in education at the university here.</p> <p>First peaceful protests, then I started volunteering in a field hospital in eastern neighbourhoods, moving between there and the government-held areas so I could carry on with my education, until I was arrested in 2013 because of that work.</p> <p>I was tortured and had a lot of psychological problems when they finally released me more than a year later. Everything had changed and my parents had left Aleppo, but I went to stay with my brother and my old friends encouraged me to start work again.</p> <p>Now I teach in the mornings, and then two days a week I go to the charity offices, where I am a team leader overseeing distribution of aid to vulnerable people in three districts.</p> <p>The other days I volunteer at hospitals, particularly during critical times like now. I\u2019ve witnessed four amputations in four days, and we don\u2019t even have any specialists.</p> <p>I just have one meal a day now, either at the hospital or at home where I cook for myself. I am lucky to still have gas because I bought a cylinder for $150 a few days ago. It\u2019s expensive, but I can make it last a long time.</p> <p>We are also short of some things that only women use. Supplies have been cut because of the siege and the men don\u2019t think of that.</p> <p>In the evening, I take advantage of the generator, which is only on for two hours, to charge my phone and my computer, and the battery for the internet router. I prepare for classes the next day, and do reports for the aid group. Then I browse the internet, chat with my brother and sister in Turkey or my friends, and go to sleep around 2am.</p> <p>I visited the USA and UK last year for a workshop and to attend a film about me and four other women working here. I did think about staying on to finish my education, but I decided to come back because my country needs me now.</p> <p>I am ambitious and conscientious, and I will complete my studies one day regardless of my age or if I have got married. I have a dream and I will still achieve it.</p> <h2><strong>The bakery coordinator: Abu Mehio</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6ac39a12d0ad15958feac4691e5d763aed63cbcb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6ac39a12d0ad15958feac4691e5d763aed63cbcb/80_0_1200_720/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Abo Mehio in eastern Aleppo.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Abu Mehio: \u2018We are very short of key supplies.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Hussein Akoush/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I\u2019m 38 years old, married with four children, and before the revolution I was a football coach at al-Shortah Police sports club. Now I am head of the local council for my neighbourhood, and until this week director of logistics for two bakeries. One was bombed on Wednesday, so now I have to try to make bread for the same number of families from just one.</p> <p>Normally I would get up early for the pre-dawn prayer, then have coffee with biscuits if we have any, before going to inspect the bakeries and help deliver loaves.</p> <p>But on Wednesday I was woken around 3am by someone banging on our door. I ran to open it and outside was a colleague, breathless, gasping: \u201cThe bakery has been hit.\u201d I threw on my clothes and jumped in the car.</p> <p>We got to the site of the attack around an hour after the bomb hit. It was a terrible scene, with the White Helmets and paramedics trying to find survivors among the rubble. They had hit the middle of the bakery on purpose, we are sure, and eight people, including one of the owners, were killed.</p> <p>Only his business partner and the head baker survived, and one of them has lost an eye. There was a terrible mess, and the van they use for bread deliveries was smashed as well, so I had to use my own car for getting out what bread we could save.</p> <p>The bakery served two large neighbourhoods, feeding nearly 6,000 families. Now I am going to have to see if the smaller bakery, already feeding 4,000 families, can stretch to making bread for more than twice that number.</p> <p>On a normal afternoon I dedicate myself to local council business. We try to do what we can for people, try to fix damaged electricity or water networks, distribute aid to vulnerable people and other things. We do our best these days even with the siege and continuous bombing and shelling.</p> <p>Then I get home some time between five and seven for dinner with my wife and children. They wait for me to eat. At the moment we are surviving on lentils, bulgur wheat, rice, and a little aubergine, from small fields nearby where you can only find aubergine, mint and parsley.</p> <p>We use a paraffin stove and sometimes wood for cooking. Gas costs a fortune, if you can even find a cylinder for sale these days. We aren\u2019t really heating up anything already cooked to save fuel, because we don\u2019t know when the siege will be broken.</p> <p>I like to spend a few hours talking with my family in the evening, although we don\u2019t have so much power these days for lights. My children are a little bored right now, as they have to stay at home all day. There are no schools open, because of the bombing.</p> <p>When they have gone to bed, I sometimes make deliveries of fuel and flour to the bakeries before coming home to sleep. Sometimes another person does this so I can rest. We are very short of key supplies.</p> <h2><strong>The White Helmet rescue worker: Ismail al-Abdullah</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"92e95b7632f5ad46a496d36fafc5f8e1db910a7e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/92e95b7632f5ad46a496d36fafc5f8e1db910a7e/0_68_2048_1229/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ismail al-Abdullah\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Abdullah: \u2018These bombs are meant to be used against military bases, so why are they dropping them here?\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Hussein Akoush</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>We are divided in two teams at each centre. Most of us work 24-hour shifts, then go home and rest. But I don\u2019t have a family in Aleppo any more so I just stay at the headquarters, sleeping and eating there.</p> <p>Yesterday was a busy night. We were called out after a bombing at around 4am, by staff at one of the hospitals. We heard a big explosion, then one of the doctors radioed us to help get the injured people to another hospital, because we can\u2019t treat them all.</p> <p>The casualties were all just lying on the floor, because there was no room for anyone on the beds and they didn\u2019t have enough staff to treat them all.</p> <p>So we raced out to help. I was out for over an hour, came back and went back to bed, then another bombing woke me up around 9am. They were calling for us from a site near the old city, where they said there was a family stuck under the rubble.</p> <p>It turned out that this wasn\u2019t a rescue mission though; they were all dead before we arrived. We brought out the bodies of three children and their father and mother.</p> <p>These bunker busters are unbelievable. I recently learned that these bombs are meant to be used against military bases, so why are they dropping them here? Maybe because they are not satisfied with the numbers of their victims from other bombs. When I hear a war plane overhead it makes my blood run cold.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0f09cf5232ed791934b393b4bf8a3c699f48c519\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0f09cf5232ed791934b393b4bf8a3c699f48c519/165_532_4331_2599/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Abdullah rescuing a child from the rubble.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Abdullah rescues a child: \u2018We are fed up of everything \u2013 bombing, killing, pulling people from under the rubble.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: sceengrab/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>We took the family to the morgue. Workers there take photos of all the victims, and if no one collects the body, then they bury them too. But neighbours and relatives came for these people, and so we drove back to headquarters.</p> <p>We still have some fuel and the cars are working as usual, but in the coming days we will run out. Food supplies are low as well \u2013 we are just living off lentils, beans and bulgar wheat, and soon we will have to start looking for wood to cook them because gas supplies are nearly out.</p> <p>All day, between rescue missions, I\u2019ve also been worrying about my family. My parents and brothers and sisters left Aleppo because of the bombing and are staying in the countryside near the Turkish border, but I lost contact with them on Tuesday.</p> <p>My mother is very sick and doesn\u2019t really have good medical care where she is living, or the medicines she needs. I\u2019m really waiting for my brother to call and tell me they are OK.</p> <p>We had dinner, we talked about what happened, and then we slept. Usually at night I stay up and play cards before bed, but we are really tired, exhausted. We are fed up of everything \u2013 bombing, killing, pulling people from under the rubble.</p> <h2><strong>The orphanage manager: Asmar Halabi</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e564110fca49f3c885cf77f454df1b7b5985dd86\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e564110fca49f3c885cf77f454df1b7b5985dd86/26_126_1212_727/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Asmar, an orphanage director.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Asmar Halabi: \u2018We are afraid of bombing day and night.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Hussein Akoush/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>We have four more children in the orphanage now, because an airstrike killed one of our staff members and her husband this week. She was called Alia Nasser, she was 32 and worked as a maid.</p> <p>Everything is getting worse, with the aerial attacks and shortages from the siege. One bomb hit only 50 metres away, the dust filled the air so you couldn\u2019t see anything. It\u2019s the worst ever attack, completely unprecedented. I saw one crater that was five metres deep.</p> <p>We are afraid of bombing day and night. When the planes come, I tell the babysitters and supervisors to take the children down to the bunker, but they can still hear the bombs landing. Some of them have got used to these sounds, but many cry, and a few of them are so frightened they wet themselves.</p> <p>We are just eating the same type of food at every meal \u2013 lentil soup and a kind of cracked bulgar wheat \u2013 and our stocks are running out.</p> <p>My biggest fear is that the siege will continue for a long time, because we have to feed 50 children and over 20 staff, and I always keep worrying about what tomorrow will bring, thinking about the shortages. I always inspect everything myself, to make sure nothing is missing.</p> <p>Because of the incessant aerial bombardment, artillery shelling and mortar shelling, I just stay inside at the orphanage or at home. I only really go out when I need to get something for myself, or when I need to pick up an orphan at the court or hand them over to a guardian.</p> <p>I often don\u2019t leave the orphanage until around 10pm. Before the siege, when there was a real market, I used to go shopping with my wife, but these days I just have dinner then sit and talk under LED lights for a bit.</p> <p>I get up again around nine or 10, drink a cup of coffee and then go back to the orphanage again, to discuss the daily situation with staff, maybe talk through some sensitive issues with the teenagers or play with the smaller children.</p> <p>Actually, because of the siege and the bombing, the orphanage takes up all my time. I feel guilty about my wife but she appreciates that I am working for vulnerable children, and supports that my job is my priority.</p> <p>Sometimes she comes with me to the orphanage, to help me and play with the children. We don\u2019t want them to get bored.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2016/09/aleppo_control-zip/giv-1406V37baXN4d5y3/\" data-alt=\"Aleppo city and governorate: the current areas of control\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2016/09/aleppo_control-zip/giv-1406V37baXN4d5y3/\">Aleppo city and governorate: the current areas of control</a> </figure>  <ul> <li>Producing in-depth, thoughtful, well-reported journalism is difficult and expensive - but supporting us isn\u2019t.

We need to recognise that the diplomacy has never faced up to the need for an initial partition or zones of influence involving neighbouring states on the path to an eventual unified settlement in Syria.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/28/west-aleppo-syrians-bombardment-assad\">The west has to look beyond Aleppo\u2019s agony | Adrian Hamilton</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Between 2012 and 2014, Turkey was ready to create a protected area in Syria for refugees, but for various reasons this was never supported by Nato. Turkey was understandably very reluctant to move militarily across the border into Syria on its own. When Russia extended an airfield close to Latakia, not far from the naval port <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_naval_facility_in_Tartus\" title=\"\">it has had in Syria</a> since 1971, and put sophisticated aeroplanes in to protect Assad\u2019s forces, everything changed. Turkey <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/nov/24/turkey-shoots-down-jet-near-border-with-syria\" title=\"\">shot down a Russian plane</a> and felt threatened by Kurdish forces pushing along its border with Syria. Turkish relations also became very strained within Nato, particularly with the US over strategies for dealing with Islamic State and the EU over refugee policies and human rights. Turkey responded perfectly reasonably by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jun/27/kremlin-says-erdogan-apologises-russian-jet-turkish\" title=\"\">defusing tensions with Russia</a>.</p> <p>In this period the Russians militarily achieved their objective, reinforced by Hezbollah fighters from Lebanon and Iranian forces, of winning back control of the key roads linking Damascus to the Mediterranean Sea for Assad. These forces, as a consequence, are back in control of this area, including Hama, which has become a Russian zone of influence.</p> <p>Only Turkey is in a political and military position to intervene on the ground over Aleppo and it is demonstrating this at present by attacking Isis. Turkey can now, because of changed circumstances, create a crucial balancing factor in Syria by taking urgent humanitarian action with its troops and air power in relieving the siege of Aleppo. Under the UN charter, even if the security council is blocked by a Russian veto, Turkey has a regional locus and a measure of legitimacy, having taken large numbers of Syrian refugees.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2016/sep/27/drone-footage-shows-scale-of-destruction-in-eastern-aleppo-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/55xv4\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2756353\"            data-video-name=\"Drone footage shows scale of destruction in eastern Aleppo \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"Reuters\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-57eaaa50e4b091b7fa2b5b19\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/09/28/160927AleppoDrone2_KP-29409722_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/09/28/160927AleppoDrone2_KP-29409722.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/09/28/160927AleppoDrone2_KP-29409722_WebM.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2016/sep/27/drone-footage-shows-scale-of-destruction-in-eastern-aleppo-video\">Drone footage shows scale of destruction in eastern Aleppo</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>There is potentially the necessary support within Nato for such an intervention by Turkey. Already special forces from a number of countries, particularly the US and UK, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/aug/09/pictures-appear-to-show-british-special-forces-on-syrian-front-line\" title=\"\">are operating in Syria</a> on the ground and they have the skills in helping to target artillery, missiles and in the last analysis aircraft. Intelligence is already fully shared with Turkey but a greater effort would have to be put in by other Nato countries. Naturally there are some in Turkey who would prefer to have Nato ground troops, but there are others who wisely see the dangers of this. It would be far preferable for Turkey to act as a regional power supported by Nato, and by keeping ground troops out it avoids the whole initiative being seen as an American-Russian confrontation.</p> <p>What provides a new basis for Turkish intervention is that on 23 September Bekir Bozda\u011f, Turkey\u2019s justice minister, announced in Istanbul that the US vice-president, Joe Biden, had accepted that there is <a href=\"http://www.dailysabah.com/war-on-terror/2016/09/24/us-vp-admits-concrete-evidence-on-gulen-involvement-submitted-by-turkey\" title=\"\">\u201cconcrete evidence\u201d</a> that Fethullah G\u00fclen, a Turkish exile living in the US, was behind <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/turkey-coup-attempt\" title=\"\">July\u2019s failed coup</a>. Assuming there is substantive evidence in relation to G\u00fclen, the political path is therefore open for early and decisive action over Syria.</p> <p>G\u00fclen left Turkey for Pennsylvania in 1999. The G\u00fclen movement, or <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%BClen_movement\" title=\"\">Cemaat</a>, which he inspires, is an Islamic community in Turkey and overseas. It operates both openly and underground in Turkey and while once the movement favoured President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan it is now deeply opposed to him. Erdo\u011fan has alleged that G\u00fclen was the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/17/fethullah-gulen-alleged-coup-mastermind-and-friendly-neighbour\" title=\"\">mastermind behind the coup</a> and Turkey asked for his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/28/turkey-fethullah-gulen-extradition-coup-attempt\" title=\"\">extradition</a> from the US. It now looks almost certain that the US justice system will return him for trial in Turkey. This means that a very damaging source of strain between Washington and Ankara is closer to being resolved.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/29/how-putins-high-risk-syria-gamble-is-paying-off\">How Putin's high-risk Syria gamble is paying off | Oleg Kashin</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Turkish military action should and could be mounted within hours of a decision by Erdo\u011fan. It would have the power to implement a no-fly zone (NFZ), with protected land corridors for humanitarian aid and the flow of people both ways into and out of Aleppo. This should be accompanied by a demand for the withdrawal of Assad forces to a line between Hama and Aleppo.</p> <p>Of course so recently after a failed military coup there is little appetite from some military leaders to undertake such a high-profile operation. But there is a counter-argument to this, for it could successfully restore the reputation of the armed forces in Turkey and demonstrate their loyalty.</p> <p>Nato forces would guard Turkey from the air as it conducted this humanitarian operation. Air activity outside the NFZ would continue against Isis in Syria and Iraq by Russia, Nato and Assad forces. A Kurdish area of influence in Syria in relation to Isis would continue de facto, but there would be no de jure implications, for that would be both unacceptable to Turkey and pre-empt a much more difficult medium-term settlement of issues that involve Iraq and Iran.</p> <p>Areas of influence would apply in other parts of Syria, if its neighbours Iraq, Saudi Arabia and Jordan are prepared to underpin them predominantly for dealing effectively with Isis. This whole initiative should be discussed at the highest military level, first in the Nato-Russian Council, before going to the security council. It is probable that Russia would veto it in the council, but we should not assume that, and on a military-to-military basis it might be possible to set the initiative in a context where Russia would see that its own sphere of influence was not being challenged.</p> <p>The humanitarian imperative is for the region to act and the world to help.</p>",
  "<p><strong>William Fotheringham: Brad, can you explain about the allergy which is behind these TUEs?</strong></p> <p><strong>Bradley Wiggins: </strong>I\u2019ve got a history of allergy to pollen. I\u2019ve got a timeline. I\u2019ve been racking my brains for the last few days right back to the first time I had real problems with it, problems it was causing me in races. The 2003 Giro was the first time I really struggled with it, the first time I\u2019d gone to a three-week stage race and noticed it, a noticeable difference to performance. More than that, when I had a severe attack, the day after I was wiped out [Wiggins was eliminated from the 2003 Giro after the 18th stage where he was outside the time limit].</p> <p><strong>WF:</strong> What exactly is it?</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/sep/30/bradley-wiggins-full-story-asthma-allergies-tues\">Bradley Wiggins opens up with full story on asthma, allergies and TUEs</a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong>BW:</strong> Uncontrollable sneezing, runny nose, watery eyes, the urge to rub my eyes constantly, and in doing that the eyes becoming bloodshot \u2026 extreme. My breathing became restricted, like breathing through a straw at times. The first person I really consulted on this and made aware of it was Dr Roger Palfreeman who was the then British Cycling doctor. All that would be on my medical records at BC, I assume.</p> <p>I completed a series of lung function tests in 2003 in his office, the results of which were sent to the UCI and he pushed hard with the French Federation \u2013 I was racing for a French team at that time \u2013 and the UCI. I\u2019m not sure what it would have been called but it was the equivalent of today\u2019s TUE. Back then at a pro team it would be written in your health book, it would be for two inhalers, fluticazone and salbutamol \u2013 it was the red inhaler basically. It was all agreed, stamped off and sent to the French Federation.</p> <p>In 2004 I went through the same process again, but I needed authorisation to compete at the summer Olympics under IOC doping regulations. So I had to complete another series of lung function tests, at the Manchester velodrome conducted by Andrea Wooles, who was in charge of that. She\u2019s now married to the Canadian performance director Richard Wooles.</p> <p>Again, I did the lung function tests, all was well and I got authorisation from the IOC. From 2005 to 2008 those applications were renewed each January to cover me for the season. They were all done by Roger Palfreeman, because I was riding for three different teams through that era.</p> <p>So my continual touch-base was always back in Manchester with BC, because of the language thing. The French doctors were always changing. By 2008 I was with the American team High Road, again there was a series of different doctors so it was always easier to keep that continuing with the doctor [at BC] so there were no mistakes. Every January I was certified to use these inhalers.</p> <p>Then up to 2009, I joined Garmin, another American team. Through that year I had contact with various members of Garmin\u2019s medical team at races, but my main point of contact remained Dr Roger Palfreeman. In that period it was always Roger.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e898d58f8c5e36c02f7c080baa826677afb1ae15\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e898d58f8c5e36c02f7c080baa826677afb1ae15/6_3_4090_3175/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Bradley Wiggins reaches the summit of Mont Ventoux during the 2009 Tour de France, with Garmin.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"776\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bradley Wiggins reaches the summit of Mont Ventoux during the 2009 Tour de France, with Garmin.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christophe Karaba/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><em>[At this point Wiggins shows interviewer his personal page on the Adams system \u2013 the computer system through which he monitors his \u201cwhereabouts\u201d for random testing.

I enter my hour slots [availability for random testing] each day and whatever goes into my body, unless I have the confirmation that says \u2018it\u2019s all right Brad I\u2019ve seen it,\u2019 until it\u2019s on there \u2026</p> <p><strong>WF: We need to keep going through the allergies.</strong></p> <p><strong>BW:</strong> In 2010 I<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2009/dec/10/bradley-wiggins-team-sky-transfer\"> joined Team Sky</a>, late in the day. By then Richard Freeman had been taken on at BC [Dr Palfreeman had resigned in spring of 2010]. He also became the Team Sky doctor, doing that with the BC job as it were. That kept it all in house. Most of the team was [from BC] then. So that was that.</p> <p>In 2010 I raced the Giro and the Tour which coincided with the pollen season. Historically for me it was May, June, July. Even though I performed well in the [2010] Giro, won the prologue, by the time we moved further south the symptoms became, as per usual at the Giro. As I said in 2003, 2005, it was always the same. I was under continual medication as I\u2019d always been so it was two Clarityns per day, one in the morning, one at night, nasal sprays, inhalers two in the morning two at night, eye drops again as and when. I was on the maximum for over-the-counter products. I struggled in the Tour that year with it, a mixture of allergies, crashing, a mixed bag of stuff really.</p> <p><em>[Wiggins finished 40th in the Giro, having won the prologue in Amsterdam; he finished 23rd in the Tour]</em></p> <p><strong>BW:</strong> Then it was 2011. I raced through to Paris-Roubaix that year, had a knee injury and needed a break after that. I didn\u2019t race again until 26 April, the Tour of Romandie. It was pretty wet and cold all week so I didn\u2019t really display any symptoms. We went straight from there to Tenerife on 13 May. That\u2019s a volcanic landscape so I\u2019ve never struggled with allergies up there, there\u2019s no grass etc.</p> <p>I came back from there, did the national time trial championships week after on 21 May, had first signs of symptoms being back home about nine days before I went to the Bayern Rundfahrt in Germany. I did Bayern Rundfahrt and won the time trial, the second-last stage, but I\u2019d been affected by the pollen all week, it was quite a hot week, that time of year. I felt I\u2019d lost the race because of it. I was starting to go really well, off the back of the altitude training etc. But I\u2019d had quite a vicious attack with it earlier in the week and it felt like it always did \u2013 leave me feeling a bit weak the next day.</p> <p>I recovered enough in time to win the time trial, went home for four days before travelling off to the Dauphin\u00e9 Lib\u00e9r\u00e9. Dr Freeman was the race doctor for us there. I hadn\u2019t seen him since Paris-Nice; [my] symptoms continued, as in \u201chow\u2019s it going Brad? \u201cI\u2019m really struggling with these allergies, I had a terrible attack last week.\u201d As per usual in races the doctor will always check: have you got any minor niggles, anything we can do to help you at this stage?</p> <p>So I was still complaining of the usual symptoms, the standard stuff, but the form was good and I was in a good place after being at altitude and everything.</p> <p>He suggested at that time that when you go back to Manchester let\u2019s go and see an independent specialist and see if there is anything you can change of the medication you\u2019re already on, and have been on for a number of years now, or if there is anything we\u2019re not doing. He\u2019ll do blood tests, run a series of tests on you and see what comes of it.</p> <p>I was quite sceptical at this stage because I\u2019d learned to live with and manage this for my whole career pretty much \u2026 all the tablets, nasal sprays, eyedrops etc. I didn\u2019t think much more of it, did the Dauphin\u00e9, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2011/jun/12/bradley-wiggins-dauphine\">won the Dauphin\u00e9</a>, still had the usual symptoms throughout but it wasn\u2019t something that, other than asking the doctor can I have some more Clarityn or can I have another nasal spray, or my inhaler\u2019s nearly running out, it wasn\u2019t something that I was shouting from the rooftops or complaining about because I had learnt to manage this, although ineffectively. It was something that I\u2019d learned to live with. I\u2019d had to get on and manage this.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"794d8d40db86e1598f8f7eee1d2373d0650898e3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/794d8d40db86e1598f8f7eee1d2373d0650898e3/192_171_3308_2162/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Wiggins during the Dauphin\u00e9 prologue in 2011, which he would go on to win.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"654\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Wiggins during the Dauphin\u00e9 prologue in 2011, which he would go on to win.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Laurent Cipriani/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>So after the Dauphin\u00e9 [which finished on 12 June] we went straight to [the Italian ski resort of] Sestriere for a week training at altitude to top it up, so I didn\u2019t go home.</p> <p>I crashed on the last day at the camp on the descent of the Col de la Croix de Fer, so I travelled home straight afterwards, the next couple of days was about getting treatment, physio, making sure everything was all right before I had to travel to the national road race a couple of days later. So I did all that. I heard nothing more of going and seeing a specialist. </p> <p><strong>WF: Had you seen the specialist at this stage?</strong></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/sep/27/chris-froome-urgent-action-tues-cycling-bradley-wiggins\">Chris Froome calls for urgent action on the use of TUEs in cycling</a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong>BW:</strong> I hadn\u2019t been home yet. So I did all that [before the national championship Wiggins also attended a Team Sky press day in Richmond], went to the nationals [which were in Stamfordham, Northumberland on 26 June], <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2011/jun/26/bradley-wiggins-national-title-tour-de-france\">won the nationals</a>, and coming back from the national I saw the specialist then on 28 June at the Beaumont hospital in Bolton. This was the first time I\u2019d been home long enough and it was only a couple of days until we travelled to the Tour [which started on 2 July].</p> <p>I saw the specialist, he did a full examination of me, blood tests, this that and the other, I went home and he compiled his report for Richard Freeman. That\u2019s the report he made to Richard Freeman. Upon doing that the medication he suggested in there would need an application for a TUE. I was still unaware at this stage of what was happening because it was the first time I\u2019d seen a specialist. Richard called me and said: \u201cyou\u2019ve been granted authorisation for a TUE based on seeing Dr Hargreaves\u201d and that was that. He showed me the TUE application, he showed me the TUE certificate. [<em>This is what features on the Fancy Bears website.</em>] And it was administered. At that time it was like this is going to cure \u2026 This is going to go a long way towards you not having any problems for the next three weeks now.</p> <p>So that was 2011. That was the first time I\u2019d been granted permission for the TUE. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2011/jul/09/team-sky-bradley-wiggins\">Obviously I crashed out of that [2011] Tour.</a></p> <p>Then into 2012. Obviously [a good] start to the year [Wiggins won a stage in the Tour of Algarve and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/mar/11/bradley-wiggins-wins-paris-nice\">won Paris-Nice in early March</a>]. In April we were in Tenerife, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/may/23/bradley-wiggins-tour-de-france\">you came up there to do an interview</a> I recall <em>[in fact Fotheringham made the trip in mid-May, the piece appearing in the Guardian on 22 May]</em>.</p> <p>No symptoms up in April, up in Tenerife. Straight back from Tenerife to the Tour of Romandie, I won the first and last stages, we were up in the mountains and I didn\u2019t display any symptoms.</p> <p>And then we saw \u2026 Pre-empting coming into May, June, July we saw Dr Hargreaves again, went back to see the specialist for a second series of tests, blood results etc, and again left that, you don\u2019t get the findings \u2026</p> <p>Back to Majorca in mid-May with the family training, went straight from there to Tenerife from May 14-25 <em>[this was in fact when the Guardian interview took place]</em>, no symptoms up there.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a3f914afa19d8df7b214a771a56667c11cf03cd5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a3f914afa19d8df7b214a771a56667c11cf03cd5/0_131_3672_2203/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Wiggins trains in the mountains of Majorca in 2012.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Wiggins trains in the mountains of Majorca in 2012.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bryn Lennon/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Then I came back end of May, started to get the onset of symptoms then, once I was back home, we live surrounded by fields and woods, flowers and things so straight away I\u2019d come out of that bubble in Tenerife and was straight into the onset of symptoms. Started all the usual, Clarityn, this that and the other, went to the Dauphin\u00e9, symptoms carried on as per usual, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/jun/10/bradley-wiggins-wins-criterium-du-dauphine\">won the Dauphin\u00e9</a>, then on to \u2026</p> <p><strong>WF: How is it you can win the Dauphin\u00e9 in spite of the symptoms?</strong></p> <p><strong>BW:</strong><em> </em>As I said before I\u2019d learnt to manage it. And some days were worse than others, some days I\u2019d be fine, I\u2019d come in the bus, I\u2019d be absolutely fine depending where we were. If we were on top of a mountain it\u2019d be completely different to if we were finishing in a town, a small village or something. You could never predict.</p> <p>One thing I would constantly have is a blocked nose. I\u2019d be constantly like I was full of a cold. Particularly when I was lying down, having a massage on my front, my nose would fill up and you could hear it in my voice talking afterwards. People would say, have you got a cold, you\u2019re not ill are you? No, I\u2019ve got hay fever, allergies. It was just a constant thing. That didn\u2019t stop me from being able to perform and train, it was kind of \u2026 A lot of it I found was a build up. If I was symptomatic for a long period over time I found that I really weakened off and I\u2019d notice the effects more. But if I\u2019d been somewhere like Tenerife for two weeks, no symptoms \u2026 That year I travelled a lot, I was either in Majorca or I was in Tenerife and very rarely at home.</p> <p><strong>WF: It\u2019s essentially that same picture throughout 2012 and 2013?</strong></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/sep/26/sir-dave-brailsford-stout-defence-team-sky-bradley-wiggins\">Sir Dave Brailsford puts up stout defence but questions hang in the air</a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong>BW:</strong> In 2012 when we saw Dr Hargreaves \u2026 We saw him on 8 May that year. That\u2019s his report from that. Richard would have applied for a TUE again, we assume. I haven\u2019t seen Richard\u2019s records of when he made the applications, I\u2019ve only seen the 2011 one. So that was that really. I just carried on with my day job really, not knowing whether we\u2019d be granted a TUE or whether we wouldn\u2019t be granted a TUE, whether a TUE application had been made. It was kind of \u2026 I left that to the medical team. They discussed these things.</p> <p>I was in a team, I\u2019d been not just in Team Sky but British Cycling before that so I knew how these things would operate. They\u2019ve discussed with you in the past, the RDTs, [Rider Development Teams; a forum within British Cycling where coaches and specialists dealing with a particular rider will go through issues with senior management] where they would go through each rider with the whole support crew around them \u2013 coach, physio, this that and the other. Where\u2019s this rider at, what can we do to help him at this stage?</p> <p>So I knew these things were discussed, I knew that at some point someone would say \u201cOK so where is Brad at now? Is he on top of his allergies? What is he doing this week?\u201d It was in Year in Yellow in the film \u2013 Dave [Brailsford], Shane [Sutton], Tim [Kerrison], sitting in the office talking about my training \u2013 Brad\u2019s power, where is he up to? I just carried on with my day job until I was told \u2018you\u2019re doing this or you\u2019re doing that.\u2019 </p> <p>We didn\u2019t come back from the Dauphin\u00e9 [which finished on June 10], we went straight to Ch\u00e2tel for post-Tour [sic \u2013 he must actually mean pre-Tour] camp, recon, looking at the time trial etc, went straight from there to Majorca with the family as we used to do then to get a week in before the Tour, then came back from Majorca on June 25 which was a Monday. We set off for the Tour on a Wednesday that year which would have been the 27th, by which time Richard had contacted me and said we had been granted a TUE based on Dr Hargreaves\u2019 report. We had thought that was the best course of action to take. I\u2019d been granted a TUE for the same medication I was on last year. So that was that, that was 2012. It was administered \u2026</p> <p><strong>WF: You\u2019ve painted a pretty consistent picture here\u2026</strong></p> <p><strong>BW:</strong> This is my history, as I see it, for my allergies. This ain\u2019t me hiding behind anyone else, this is as I have lived, being with different teams throughout the years, until I was in the care of Dr Richard Freeman at BC. He was the first doctor to actually get me to a specialist for that. </p> <p><strong>WF: In 2010 why didn\u2019t you have the TUE? </strong></p> <p><strong>BW:</strong> It wasn\u2019t suggested to me. Aside from complaining about the normal symptoms \u2013 \u201cI\u2019m on Clarityn, can you give me some of that, have we got loads on the race when we go to the Giro or the Tour? Can we have the nasal spray that I\u2019m on? Just checking the usual stuff, eyedrops, red inhalers, blue salbutamol inhalers\u201d \u2013 never at any point was it suggested that we go and see a specialist. At the end of the day I was the asset in that period, the team leader, concentrating on training and everything else. The team of people around me, they all had a different job to do.</p> <p><strong>WF: Did you know what Kenalog was? You knew it was cortisone?</strong></p> <p><strong>BW:</strong> Yes.</p> <p><strong>WF: That didn\u2019t concern you in any way? </strong></p> <p><strong>BW:</strong> I think \u2026 There is a taboo around it but it\u2019s erm \u2026 As I said, I think I said it on the Andrew Marr Show, my job as an athlete when someone says \u2018right this is the course, this is what Dr Hargreaves has recommended we take, we\u2019ve applied for the TUE, you\u2019ve been granted authorisation to take it\u2019, but what is it? Of course. You ask, I always ask what\u2019s going in my body. Kenalog, cortisone in other words. You get told it\u2019s that tri\u2026 whatever it is [triamcinolone], in other words cortisone. All right. Then it\u2019s the same old thing: they use that to treat hay fever allergies because at the end of the day it\u2019s an antihistamine, a very strong, powerful antihistamine. <em>[This is not actually the case, Kenalog and its ilk are synthetic hormones which act on the entire immune response; an antihistamine specifically counters the effects of the inflammatory chemical histamine.]</em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"34ad1797a5cf0dcbdea18c7cec19a221ac0e982e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/34ad1797a5cf0dcbdea18c7cec19a221ac0e982e/0_0_3000_2120/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Wiggins on the BBC\u2019s Andrew Marr Show last weekend.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"707\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Wiggins on the BBC\u2019s Andrew Marr Show last weekend.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Handout/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>What doses are they giving? 40 milligrams? Isn\u2019t that what they always used to \u2026 usual questions, you\u2019ve read it in the book, isn\u2019t that what they used to use? Yes, but they were taking that in much larger amounts, as and when, to perform or to lose weight. They were basically abusing this drug.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/sep/24/bradley-wiggins-andrew-marr-unfair-advantage\">Bradley Wiggins tells Andrew Marr \u2018I did not seek an unfair advantage\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <p>This was for 40mg, intramuscularly, and having been authorised to use it as well, much like the inhalers which are corticosteroids as well, other people that have had bee stings that have to have pen-whatever it is [probably referring to EpiPen, used for bee stings]. So I was fully aware of this drug and the taboo surrounding it all\u2026 the misuse and the abuse of this drug in the past.</p> <p><strong>WF: And that didn\u2019t worry you? </strong></p> <p><strong>BW:</strong> No, it was for a very specific thing to treat something that was historically a problem for me and could be quite a serious problem for me. The problem with it was it was unpredictable. I couldn\u2019t say, well, this was going to happen on this day or wonder what the weather is going to \u2026 if we are going to have a hot Tour, if we\u2019re going to have all this stuff floating around the air, that the helicopter\u2019s chopping up from flying over.</p> <p>At that stage it was quite clear I was going well, all of a sudden I\u2019d become a potential favourite for the Tour de France, or certainly get on the podium.</p> <p>I\u2019d returned to the form I was in in 2009 and the only thing that could really stop me from achieving that was if I struggled with allergies during the race. It happens. It happened with Quintana this year. He wasn\u2019t himself because of it or he cited those problems. It had been on certain days in the past a real problem for me.</p> <p><strong>WF: Why didn\u2019t you mention the allergy in the book? It\u2019s not in the book. </strong><em>[This is a reference to the account of 2010-12 My Time ghostwritten by the interviewer]. </em><strong>And it wasn\u2019t there when we did the interviews for the book.</strong></p> <p><strong>BW:</strong> To be honest, this was something I\u2019d lived with since I was 15 years of age. I\u2019d had attacks when I was 15 at juvenile races in Norwich and stuff in the summer. My mother suffers from it terribly. It\u2019s a genetic thing. It\u2019s something I\u2019d got used to. It\u2019s not something I was going to stand on TV in 2010 and say \u2026 I\u2019ll be honest with you, I remember doing an interview at the top of a mountain, Ax-Trois-Domaines. I\u2019d had a shocking day, I remember coming down the descent sneezing me head off, blowing snot out of my nose, unable to breath, I got dropped on the last climb and got to the finish. [Australian journalist] John Trevorrow did an interview with me, I just said, \u201cI\u2019m fucked, empty, I\u2019ve got nothing left\u201d.</p> <p>It was all in reference to poor form, struggling with allergies but I\u2019m not going to sit there \u2026 I was paranoid about making excuses: \u201cAh, my allergies have kicked in.\u201d I\u2019d learned to live with this thing. It wasn\u2019t something I was going to shout from the rooftops and use as an excuse and say, \u201cmy allergies have started off again\u201d. That\u2019s convenient isn\u2019t it Brad, your allergies started when you got dropped.</p> <p>I didn\u2019t mention it in the book. I\u2019d come off a season of \u2026 I\u2019d won everything that year. When I was writing the book I wasn\u2019t sat there thinking, \u201cI\u2019d better bring my allergies up\u201d. I was flying on cloud nine after dominating the sport all year. It wasn\u2019t something that I brought to mind.</p> <p>Like I said, I\u2019ve lived with this. All the doctors over the years I\u2019ve been with in various teams will verify that I was always complaining of allergies.

There have never been any allegations of improper practice relating to Leinders\u2019s spell at Sky in 2011 and 2012, but the ruling on his time at the Dutch Rabobank team from 2002-09 was detailed and damning.]</em></p> <p><strong>BW:</strong> Yes. </p> <p><strong>WF: It has been documented that </strong><em>[while at Dutch team Rabobank from 2002 to 2009] </em><strong>Dr Leinders administered riders with triamcinolone to enhance their performance. The question has to be asked, did Dr Leinders know about your TUEs?</strong></p> <p><strong>BW:</strong> I don\u2019t know, that\u2019s the truth. </p> <p><strong>WF: Did you ever speak to him about the TUEs? </strong></p> <p><strong>BW:</strong> I never personally spoke to him about that.</p> <p><strong>WF: Did he ever ask you about your allergies? </strong></p> <p><strong>BW:</strong> Never. The only person I ever spoke to about my TUEs was my doctor Richard Freeman. I don\u2019t know, as I said, whether that was discussed around a table with the medical team. I don\u2019t know if the medical team had meetings together regularly to discuss all the riders \u2013 because there were four or five doctors on the team at that stage. So I don\u2019t know. He never spoke to me about it. I can recall two races in 2011, three races that I did with Leinders, that was Paris-Roubaix, Tour of Romandie, and the Vuelta \u2013 or half the Vuelta, I think they changed doctors halfway through. That was never discussed with me, never.</p> <p><strong>WF: But given your symptoms, would he have known? </strong></p> <p><strong>BW:</strong> I don\u2019t know in truth. I don\u2019t know. Other than having the medication I was on. But at those races I had \u2026 Paris-Roubaix I had no problems, I crashed at that race \u2026</p> <p><strong>WF: But would he have seen you taking the medication? </strong></p> <p><strong>BW:</strong> He wouldn\u2019t have seen me. I was on an inhaler. I mean [Sunday Times journalist] David Walsh knew we were all on inhalers in 2013, seven of us. </p> <p><strong>WF: The question also arises, why did you not have the same TUE in 2014. One of the problems with the TUEs is the timing. It is as simple as that. Why did the TUEs stop in 2014? </strong></p> <p><strong>BW:</strong> The triamcinolone, not the inhaler one? The inhaler ones stopped because you didn\u2019t need one any more\u2026</p> <p><strong>WF: Because it becomes legal \u2026</strong></p> <p><strong>BW:</strong> Because I was doing the Tour of California that year, I did Paris-Roubaix early season, again no problems, as you know I got ninth, then I was doing Tour of California.

So the first of May I went out there and had no symptoms at all \u2013 we were out there for three weeks.</p> <p>The doctor out there at the time, can\u2019t remember who it was, did the race, anyway I didn\u2019t need medication \u2013 I wasn\u2019t taking Clarytin, I wasn\u2019t displaying any symptoms out there.</p> <p>At the end of that race, that was when I knew that I wasn\u2019t doing the Tour de France. Dave [Brailsford] came out to the end of the race. There were issues with the team whether I\u2019d make selection or not, all the stuff that went with that.</p> <p>We stayed in America for another week after that. It was during that week I decided I\u2019d come back and have a crack at the track programme for the Commonwealth Games. All that stuff with me going on the BBC was the end result of knowing for a long period then talking with Dave and him saying, why don\u2019t you go and do the Commonwealth Games? Do the pursuit and team pursuit. And that\u2019s when went back to the CG.</p> <p>I joined the track squad and was training indoors most of the time. I wasn\u2019t displaying the symptoms or they weren\u2019t problematic, it wasn\u2019t a huge issue other than going out on the road around here using Clarityn, eyedrops. I was indoors, I wasn\u2019t having problems with my breathing, I wasn\u2019t complaining about it, I didn\u2019t need to go and see a specialist or anything.</p> <p>It was the same in 2015. I knew I\u2019d finish at Paris-Roubaix, I knew I\u2019d go and do the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/jun/09/bradley-wiggins-team-rebut-rule-bending-accusations-hour-record\">Hour Record project</a> and 90% of that is going to be indoors.

Did you notice any difference?</strong><em> [There have never been any allegations of improper practice relating to Leinders\u2019s spell at Sky in 2011 and 2012.]</em></p> <p><strong>BW:</strong> Other than one or two new doctors, no. That was something that wasn\u2019t noticeable as a rider. It may have changed the way things were done among the medical team. As a rider, no, I\u2019d had 10 years of doing it, turning up at bike races, most of the time a different doctor at that race, on-race doctor, but other than that no, nothing different to the year before other than different faces because obviously [Sky carer] Txema [Gonzalez] had died the year before [at the Vuelta]. [The former Sky doctor] David Hulse had left but no, I\u2019m trying to think of the medical team at that time, Dr Richard Freeman, Leinders came on board, no, I didn\u2019t notice anything different.</p> <p><strong>WF: Did you know about the decision to hire Dr Leinders? </strong></p> <p><strong>BW:</strong> No.</p> <p><strong>WF: No one spoke about that to you? </strong></p> <p><strong>BW:</strong> I\u2019d had a shit year. My grandad died at the end of the year. I\u2019d lost all contact with the team. I got a massive bollocking at the end of the year from Dave, we\u2019d moved here, I was doing house work and stuff. Cycling was way off the spectrum at that point for me. I felt like I\u2019d got berated all season for under-performing \u2026</p> <p>The first time, I remember going straight from the Dave Rayner [Fund] dinner that year to the first camp, the get-together which was down Reading way, Marlow, turned up there and had my pre season meeting with the managers: what do you want to do next year? I said I wanted a complete change, wanted to do Paris-Roubaix, De Panne, not worry about the Tour, try and do something early season, something in Paris-Nice.</p> <p>We had all our pre-season ECGs and everything all on site, because I had missed all that the previous year because I\u2019d joined so late, I\u2019d missed that first get-together because I wasn\u2019t released from Garmin until December. We had our ECGs, all that, and that was the first time I saw Geert Leinders there. I didn\u2019t know who he was or where he\u2019d come from, other than that some of the riders knew him \u2026</p> <p><strong>WF: Because he\u2019d been at Rabobank \u2026</strong></p> <p><strong>BW:</strong> So that was that. I didn\u2019t really think anything of it other than saying hello to these new faces, I couldn\u2019t wait to get out of there, because at that time I was still coming to terms with everything.</p> <p><strong>WF: Do you understand people who say that having these injections was unethical. Not illegal, but unethical.</strong></p> <p><strong>BW:</strong> Erm \u2026 It seemed \u2026 without all the context of someone\u2019s history then I could see that on paper maybe, especially the way some of it has been reported. It\u2019s been very sensationalised in parts and very personal in other parts. Straight off, the way cycling is today, yes, yes. Because it doesn\u2019t take much in cycling in this day and age now because of what\u2019s gone before. So I understand that.</p> <p><strong>WF: But this is a substance that</strong><em> [confessed doper and anti-doping campaigner] </em><strong>David Millar, for example, is </strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/sep/20/david-millar-triamcinolone-drug-use-banned-wada-hacking-scandal\"><strong>saying should be banned</strong></a><strong>.</strong><em> </em></p> <p><strong>BW:</strong> Yes. But as I said before I\u2019d like to know in all honesty with David, if that\u2019s the case, what doses were they taking then? Let\u2019s have some more specifics please. When did you take it, how much did you take, how did you feel the day after when you took it? Just to put some context to this dose for this specific reason.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/sep/20/david-millar-triamcinolone-drug-use-banned-wada-hacking-scandal\">David Millar calls for drug used by Bradley Wiggins to be banned</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Because it\u2019s all right saying things like that because that gets people riled, but used in the correct way for specific things it has a place like anything in medicine.</p> <p>So I would say it\u2019s all right J\u00f6rg Jaksche saying oh well we used to use that. [German former professional cyclist Jaksche confessed in 2007 to blood doping; <a href=\"http://cyclingtips.com/2016/09/jaksche-on-skys-tue-controversy-we-used-the-same-excuse-in-my-era/\">in an interview with the website cyclingtips</a>, he stated that he had \u2018used the same procedure\u2019]</p> <p>Well how much did you [Millar] used to use and when? Did you use it before the time trial in 2003 in the Tour when you won the time trial? [Millar won the 2003 time trial from Pornic to Nantes at a time when he was doping]. Did you use it that day? When did you take it - the night before? Did you take it the morning of? How much did you take? What other times did you use it? How much did you used to take before you used to go out and try to lose two kilos in a week? So more specifics around that to give context to the whole situation. That alone, that doesn\u2019t tell you anything. And then what else were you taking at that time in conjunction with that? Was it just cortisone in that period? Was everyone abusing cortisone? Or was it in conjunction with EPO, with testosterone, all those other things? </p> <p><strong>WF: What about when someone like </strong><em>[Dutch professional] </em><strong>Tom Dumoulin who, as far as I can gather rides for a team which is pretty straight up on its ethics, from what I\u2019ve heard about Giant-Alpecin they have a very distinct ethical approach, when someone like that says, \u201cit stinks\u201d, how do you react to that?</strong><em> </em></p> <p><strong>BW:</strong> Yeah. Well, I think he\u2019s on the ground racing at the moment when he got asked the question. You have to ask how these questions are loaded to these guys. This is a guy who\u2019s got many, many years left in the sport \u2026 What if he says, \u201cno, I\u2019ve got no problem with that, if used in the right context.\u201d \u201cWell would you use it then?\u201d You know how the question is loaded. It has to be put in context.</p> <p>For someone just to come up and say, \u201cdo you condone this using of cortisone?\u201d a lot of riders in this day and age, especially young riders, are not going to say, \u201cwell I do actually\u201d. Anyone who can take a step back from this and go, \u201cwell actually I\u2019d have to look at the case, I can\u2019t comment at the moment, I\u2019d have to look at the whole case in perspective of why it was used \u2026\u201d In the same way it was reported the other day about Fabian Cancellara, 120mg of prednisolone three days before the Vuelta \u2026</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/sep/23/steve-cummings-british-athletes-named-latest-fancy-bears-leak-wada\">Fabian Cancellara and Galen Rupp named in latest Fancy Bears leak</a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong>WF: For a bee sting \u2026</strong></p> <p><strong>BW:</strong> But in the context of that, \u201cthree days before the Vuelta, what\u2019s that about?\u201d And then it\u2019s not until Trek-Segafredo release the pictures of him and you think bloody hell his face, no wonder he needed [it], so I think it has to be put in context of everything. I understand why that question is being asked but I also know what bike riders are like today and there is a fear factor around saying anything other than no, I wouldn\u2019t.</p> <p><strong>WF: How would you have felt if someone you were riding against in the Tour de France, let\u2019s say in 2009, had been documented as doing this? </strong></p> <p><strong>BW:</strong> Well, again you\u2019d have to see the whole case. You\u2019d want to know why it had been granted. That\u2019s probably a question for the UCI \u2013 how many people are on TUEs in those Tours? Maybe the UCI should say this is well why he was on this TUE, but then there is sensitive medical records here. Some people might have sensitive medical issues that they don\u2019t want people to know about. Unfortunately we are carrying the can for everything that went before here and statements like Dave saying, \u201cthis stuff should be banned.\u201d</p> <p><strong>WF: Do you think TUEs should be made public? </strong></p> <p><strong>BW:</strong> No I don\u2019t, no. Because again \u2026</p> <p><strong>WF: I don\u2019t mean should they be leaked by the Fancy Bears, what I mean is should it be noted publicly how many TUEs a team has and when? Perhaps not naming the riders? Or listing them by team, date, substance, again without naming the riders? For clarity.</strong></p> <p><strong>BW:</strong> How many people are on TUEs for a start would add context to what\u2019s going on in the peloton at the moment but I think just throwing them out there, \u201cthis is what he\u2019s on, this is what he\u2019s on\u201d, that\u2019s ludicrous. I mean there\u2019s all sorts, people might have sexually transmitted diseases that they are on TUEs for, that\u2019s too sensitive for some people. That\u2019s more of a question for the governing bodies and Wada: how do they manage this TUE system across all sports, not just cycling? What\u2019s the application process \u2013 it goes to three independent doctors and they all have to sign this TUE off. </p> <p><strong>WF: But that wasn\u2019t the case when you had yours because the TUE panel didn\u2019t come in until later.</strong></p> <p><strong>BW:</strong> I don\u2019t know who signed it off or who it went through at that stage. </p> <p><strong>WF: I\u2019m told it was easier to get one before 2014.</strong></p> <p><strong>BW:</strong> Until I get the authorisation back I don\u2019t know what process it\u2019s gone through at that particular time. I was concentrating on winning the national road race or getting ready for the Tour, I was out in Majorca training with the family, I wasn\u2019t thinking I wonder where that is at the moment or what it\u2019s doing. That was the medical team\u2019s job.</p> <p><strong>WF: It\u2019s been pointed out \u2013 rightly \u2013 that in the book we wrote together it says specifically that you haven\u2019t had any injections apart from your vaccinations. How did that come about?</strong></p> <p><strong>BW:</strong> As I\u2019ve just said with the cortisone question, with Tom Dumoulin being asked that question \u2026 The landscape at that time was very much Lance Armstrong, needle bans, this that and the other. In my eyes at that time when I was asked that question it was very much have you ever used needles \u2026</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2012/jul/13/bradley-wiggins-dope-drugs\">Bradley Wiggins: I can never dope because it would cost me everything</a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong>WF: I have a note which says very specifically that I was going to ask you if you\u2019d had injections other than IVs for recovery in the past, diarrhoea or whatever, to clarify that.</strong></p> <p><strong>BW:</strong> I was still thinking it was loaded in the sense of, if people ask have you used needles, I always automatically assume it\u2019s for intravenous, EPO, those things, testosterone, iron to support EPO use.</p> <p>In my mind it was always loaded and associated with doping, whenever I was asked that. It was around that time, the UCI had brought in a needle ban \u2026 and they were for intravenous injections on races. This is four years ago as well, don\u2019t forget, I\u2019m trying to think of the landscape at the time, Tour de France winner, Lance Armstrong\u2019s about to go down, he\u2019s about to lose everything.</p> <p>I\u2019d just come off the Tour that year, that press conference. In my mind it was always about defending [myself from] that doping culture, everything that went with the doping culture or riders carrying washbags around with their own syringes in and injecting themselves.</p> <p>People never asked around that time \u201chave you ever been injected by a doctor or a physician for medical reasons?\u201d That\u2019s a completely different question to \u201cdo you use needles?\u201d</p> <p>You\u2019ve got to remember at that time, back when I turned professional, people were still carrying needles around with them in washbags. Early 2000s was a crazy time for that. Riders were doing it for themselves, injecting vitamins or as we\u2019ve seen since the Armstrong thing, hanging drips on the walls. [Riccardo] Ricc\u00f2 nearly killed himself putting it in the fridge himself and storing blood, that to me is: have you ever used needles? That whole taboo around it, the landscape at that time, with Armstrong and having just won the Tour de France, it was always steering towards that \u2013 I took every question as steered towards that. I always felt I was having to defend myself, particularly coming off the back of the Tour de France that year where it was, what are Sky up to?</p> <p><strong>WF: Do you understand that in terms of the triamcinolone injections, we are dealing with a grey area? Do you get that? </strong></p> <p><strong>BW:</strong> I\u2019m trying to get my head around why people see it like that.

So I understand that.\u201d</p> <p>In the interview, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/sep/30/bradley-wiggins-interview-tues\">the full transcript of which is published</a> on Friday on theguardian.com, Wiggins says:</p> <p>\u2022 He had been suffering from the affects of pollen allergies since the 2003 Giro d\u2019Italia and they had significantly affected his performances.</p> <p>\u2022 He had not previously revealed details of the allergies, particularly in his 2012 autobiography, because he was \u201cparanoid about making excuses\u201d for not performing well.</p> <p>\u2022 That rather than being performance enhancing, he believes the injections were sometimes \u201ca detriment to my performance\u201d.</p> <p>\u2022 That although he is not certain who apart from the team doctor, Richard Freeman, knew about the injections, he assumes all senior coaches at Team Sky, including the team principal, Sir David Brailsford, were aware of them</p> <p>Wiggins added: \u201cI understand because \u2026 I saw the hoorah a couple of years ago with Froome with the Tour of Romandie inhaler and the last-minute TUE, racing on it.\u201d Chris Froome, the three-times Tour de France winner for Team Sky, was the subject of controversy after he was revealed to have won the Tour de Romandie in 2014 after receiving a TUE for a steroid to treat a chest infection.</p> <p>\u201cI saw the hysteria that caused and I understand in the post-Armstrong [era],\u201d Wiggins continued. \u201cYeah, I do understand. But what I don\u2019t understand is that you\u2019ve automatically just assumed that this was a performance enhancer.\u201d</p> <p>The Guardian has also constructed a detailed timeline of Wiggins\u2019s three TUE applications for the first time; this highlighted several inconsistencies within the TUE approval forms that were leaked by the hacking website <a href=\"www.fancybear.net/pages/2.html\">Fancy Bears</a> on 15 September. These appear in the main to be clerical errors. The Union Cycliste Internationale, cycling\u2019s world governing body, has been asked for comment and clarification but has not responded before publication.</p> <p>Triamcinolone formed part of the repertoire of banned drugs whose use has been described by self-confessed cycling dopers such as the Briton David Millar, the German J\u00f6rg Jaksche and the Dane Michael Rasmussen. Jaksche and Rasmussen both said that they had been issued the corticosteroid within the rules using TUEs; Jaksche described the way Wiggins had received his as being \u201cthe same procedure\u201d.</p> <p>Doctors including Prentice Steffen \u2013 Wiggins\u2019s team medic at the Garmin team in 2009 \u2013 and Jeroen Swart, the South African expert in high-performance cycling, have said they were uneasy with the use of triamcinolone at such significant times, and for the treatment of pollen allergies. \u201cYou do have to think it is kind of coincidental that a big dose of intramuscular long-acting corticosteroids would be needed at that \u2026 exact time before the most important race of the season,\u201d said Dr Steffen. \u201cI would certainly say now that it does not look good, it doesn\u2019t look right from a health or a sporting perspective.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/video/2016/sep/26/bradley-wiggins-reputation-fancy-bears-leak-video-report\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/54nxa\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2752741\"            data-video-name=\"Wiggins faces battle for reputation after Fancy Bears leak \u2013 video report\"            data-video-provider=\"AP/ Reuters\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-57e91d65e4b03598d1ce8c44\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/09/26/160926WigginsFancyBears_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/09/26/160926WigginsFancyBears.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/09/26/160926WigginsFancyBears_WebM.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/video/2016/sep/26/bradley-wiggins-reputation-fancy-bears-leak-video-report\">Wiggins faces battle for reputation after Fancy Bears leak</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>Wiggins said he had asked what he was being administered, and he had been \u201cfully aware of this drug and the taboo surrounding it all \u2026 the misuse and the abuse of this drug in the past\u201d. He added: \u201cIt was for a very specific thing \u2026 to treat something that was historically a problem for me and could be quite a serious problem for me. I\u2019d become a potential favourite for the Tour de France, or certainly to get on the podium. I\u2019d returned to the form I was in in 2009 and the only thing that could really stop me from achieving that was if I struggled with allergies during the race. It happens.\u201d</p> <p>Wiggins told the Guardian that he began suffering from asthma at races at the age of 15, and that he first noticed the effects of pollen allergies during the 2003 Giro d\u2019Italia, his first major stage race. He described, \u201ca noticeable difference to performance \u2026 When I had a severe attack, the day after I was wiped out.\u201d Asked to describe his symptoms, he stated: \u201cUncontrollable sneezing, runny nose, watery eyes, the urge to rub my eyes constantly, and in doing that the eyes becoming bloodshot \u2026 extreme. My breathing became restricted, like breathing through a straw at times.\u201d</p> <p>He added that he had kept the condition under control using over the counter medicines: \u201cContinual medication \u2026 two Clarityns per day, one in the morning, one at night, nasal sprays, inhalers \u2013 two in the morning, two at night, eye drops as and when. I was on the maximum for over the counter products.\u201d He described a mountain stage in the 2010 Tour de France, where he finished 23rd while \u201csneezing my head off, blowing snot out of my nose, unable to breathe\u201d.</p> <p>Letters shown to the Guardian by Wiggins and others with the rider\u2019s specific permission make it clear that the TUE applications were backed up by specialists\u2019 reports, as detailed in the TUE forms <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/sep/18/bradley-wiggins-world-anti-doping-agency-hackers-russian-leak\">leaked by the Fancy Bears hackers</a>. The letters include the statement that the administration of triamcinolone would be likely to mitigate the symptoms suffered by Wiggins, for an extended period.</p> <p>That tallies with the current manufacturers\u2019 guidelines for the use of triamcinolone, which state: \u201cPatients with hay fever or pollen asthma who are not responding to pollen administration and other conventional therapy may obtain a remission of symptoms lasting throughout the pollen season after a single injection of 40mg to 100mg.\u201d Kenalog, the trade name for the treatment containing triamcinolone, was widely used in the UK as a last-resort treatment for severe hay fever until a few years ago, when NHS guidelines ruled against it due to its possible side effects. \u201cIt is highly effective and the effects would last three-to-four weeks,\u201d a current GP told the Guardian.</p> <p>Suspicions have been raised over the administration of the substance to Wiggins a few days before the 2012 Tour de France, which he won, and the 2011 Tour and 2013 Giro d\u2019Italia, other major target events, from which he withdrew because of crashes. Wiggins confirmed that he first saw a specialist on 28 June 2011, shortly before he travelled to the start of that year\u2019s Tour, which started on 2 July. He added that he first discussed the issue with his Dr Freeman at the Crit\u00e9rium du Dauphin\u00e9 stage race that year; that event finished on 12 June, after which he went to training camp in Italy for a week.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/sep/27/chris-froome-urgent-action-tues-cycling-bradley-wiggins\">Chris Froome calls for urgent action on the use of TUEs in cycling</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Wiggins added that he was in some doubt about whether the triamcinolone injection might have been counter-productive in 2011, as he described his form during that year\u2019s Tour declining. \u201cI actually think it was a detriment to my performance,\u201d he said. \u201cAs the first week went on I felt like I was getting weaker and weaker, I didn\u2019t have the power. Obviously I crashed out so I will never know. I was borderline there anyway, right down probably below [the weight] that was ideal for me and I think this just tipped me over the edge.\u201d</p> <p>It is hard to assess how many people in Wiggins\u2019s immediate orbit knew about his allergies. In his 2012 autobiography My Time, he described his form in the run-up to the 2012 Tour as near-perfect. Indeed, the condition is not mentioned anywhere in the book. When this was put to Wiggins, he explained: \u201cI was paranoid about making excuses \u2013 \u2018Ah, my allergies have kicked in.\u2019 I\u2019d learned to live with this thing.</p> <p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t something I was going to shout from the rooftops and use as an excuse, and say: \u2018My allergies have started off again\u2019 - \u2018That\u2019s convenient, isn\u2019t it Brad, your allergies started when you got dropped.\u2019 I didn\u2019t mention it in the book. I\u2019d come off a season of \u2026 I\u2019d won everything that year. When I was writing the book I wasn\u2019t sat there thinking: \u2018I\u2019d better bring my allergies up.\u2019 I was flying on cloud nine after dominating the sport all year. It wasn\u2019t something that I brought to mind.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a271319a6ebbc600e37325b15bd35bbaf65a98ce\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a271319a6ebbc600e37325b15bd35bbaf65a98ce/0_953_5824_3493/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Bradley Wiggins: \u2018I was paranoid about making excuses.\u2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bradley Wiggins: \u2018I was paranoid about making excuses.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Pal Hansen for The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Wiggins told the Guardian that the only member of Team Sky who he was certain knew about the treatment was Dr Freeman, but that he assumed the close-knit coaching team who worked with him would have known: Brailsford, Shane Sutton \u2013 the then head coach \u2013 and Tim Kerrison, who was his personal coach from 2011 onwards at the team.</p> <p>Wiggins repeated his assertion that the controversial doctor Geert Leinders, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/jan/22/geert-leinders-life-ban-team-sky-doctor\">banned for life in 2015</a> for doping violations, had no involvement in the decision to switch to stronger treatment for his allergies. Leinders worked for Sky in 2011-12; his doping violations relate to the period before he joined the team. \u201cI never spoke to him about that. He never spoke to me about that.\u201d Asked if Leinders had asked him about his allergies, Wiggins said: \u201cNever.\u201d</p> <h2>Timeline: Bradley Wiggins and therapeutic use exemptions</h2> <h2>2011</h2> <p><strong>Mid-June</strong> Wiggins discusses his allergy issues with Dr Richard Freeman, Team Sky medic, at the Crit\u00e9rium du Dauphin\u00e9 event, which ends on 12 June</p> <p><strong>26 June</strong> Wiggins wins British national championship in Stamfordham, Northumberland</p> <p><strong>28 June</strong> Wiggins visits specialist Simon Hargreaves in Bolton for examination and tests.

This is a single dose approval for a single day and no more. It is possible that the TUE was approved verbally by telephone due to time constraints \u2013 for example that Wiggins was flying to the Tour de France on the 30th \u2013 and the form filled out afterwards. It was also within the regulations for one person to approve the TUE. The UCI\u2019s then head of medical, Mario Zorzoli, has been asked for clarification, as hasthe UCI.</p> <p>Approval form leaked to Fancy Bears cites \u201cendoscopy on July 2\u201d. This is clearly impossible as the Tour started on that day and Wiggins\u2019s specialist visit has been documented as 28 June. It can only be a clerical error. Zorzoli has been asked for clarification, as has the UCI.</p> <p><strong>2012</strong> TUE approval form leaked to Fancy Bears cites \u201csee TUE application 30/5/11\u201d whereas the 2011 application was made on the 28 June and approval given 30 June. The Guardian was shown the date on Wiggins\u2019 application form with his permission and can confirm it was dated 28 June. One possible explanation is a clerical error mixing 30/5/11 with 30/6/11. Again, Zorzoli and the UCI have been asked for clarification.</p> <p>The TUE approval form leaked to Fancy Bears states <em>\u201cnom de la competition\u201d</em> (name of relevant race) as Dauphin\u00e9 Lib\u00e9r\u00e9 whereas the TUE was actually intended for the Tour de France. This is because the race listed is the next race after the application, not its approval. The application was made on 31 May; the Dauphin\u00e9 began on 3 June.</p>",
  "<p>The next Metropolitan police commissioner must have a background in policing to retain the confidence of rank-and-file officers, the chair of the force\u2019s police federation has said.</p> <p>Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe announced on Thursday his retirement from the most senior policing role in Britain, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/sep/30/hogan-howe-met-police-chief-race-gets-under-way\">triggering the search for a new commissioner</a>.</p> <p>Speculation as to who will fill the position began instantly, with a report in the Times suggesting Sir Charles Montgomery \u2013 the head of the Border Force who was the second sea lord when he retired from the navy in 2012 \u2013 is being considered as a successor.</p> <p>But Ken Marsh, the chair of the Metropolitan Police Federation, the regional branch of the body that represents thousands of rank-and-file officers, said the next Met chief must have climbed the ranks to succeed in the role.<br></p> <p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t an easy gig that you can just walk into,\u201d Marsh said. \u201cI believe, I firmly believe, you have to have a firm footing, or an understanding of what takes place in the lower ranks all the way through. That\u2019s how you have the opportunity and bring everyone together, which is what you need to do as a commissioner.\u201d</p> <p>Marsh said he did not think the home secretary, Amber Rudd, and the London mayor, Sadiq Khan, who are responsible for appointing the commissioner, would recruit from outside policing \u201cin a month of Sundays\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cIt would be controversial, but I don\u2019t think they will.\u201d</p> <p>Marsh said it would not be appropriate for the commissioner to be recruited from overseas, which is an option open to all forces after regulations were changed under the previous home secretary, Theresa May.</p> <p>\u201cI would like to see someone internally or close to us because they will understand what they\u2019re talking about,\u201d Marsh said.<br></p> <p>Hogan-Howe completed a full five-year term earlier this month \u2013 the first <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/metropolitan-police\">Metropolitan police</a> commissioner not to be ousted in a decade \u2013 and was expected to continue for another year after having his contract extended. He will now retire in February 2017.</p> <p>News of his departure came ahead of the release next month of a report into the Met\u2019s handling of historical sex abuse cases, which is expected to be critical, though probably not of the commissioner.</p> <p>Among those who may apply for the \u00a3276,000-a-year post is Mark Rowley, an assistant commissioner of the Met who oversees counter-terrorism.</p> <p>Another contender is Sara Thornton, the chair of the National <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/police\">Police</a> Chiefs\u2019 Council and former head of the Thames Valley force, bordering London.

Rosetta is the first time that a spacecraft has really studied a comet. It has been travelling with Comet 67P/C-G since August 2014. In that time, the scientists believe that they have understood for the first time the way in which comets are formed more than 4 billion years ago, at the same time that our own planet was forming.</p> <p> Key to their new understanding are features on the comet called \u2018positive relief features\u2019. These are lumps of about a metre across. The scientists refer to them as goose bumps; I\u2019ve even heard them called dragon\u2019s eggs.</p> <p> Today\u2019s descent is designed to get the best images possible of these goose bumps. Rosetta is heading towards a pit in the Ma\u2019at region of the comet. Inside the pit, it will be trying to see more goosebumps. </p> <p>These are thought to be the original icy boulders that formed in the solar system more than four billion years ago and then came together to form this comet. In short, the goose bumps are some of the most ancient unaltered objects from the beginning of the solar system. They contain all the ingredients that were available to form life on Earth.</p> <p> The descent today is designed to see these natural treasures in as much detail as possible \u2013 and the only way to do it is to sacrifice the spacecraft. </p> <p> But what a way to go \u2013 cutting edge science to the very end.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-09-30T11:38:02.499Z\">at 12.38pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57ee28d3e4b0c38a12e7154b\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-30T08:57:47.464Z\">9.57am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>First you see it, then you don\u2019t.

The spacecraft will touch the comet\u2019s surface with a speed of about 90 cm/s, or about walking pace. Is it a landing? Not really, because the spacecraft is descending too fast. Is it a crash? Not really, because the spacecraft is descending too slowly. People here seem to be calling it a controlled descent.</p> <p> At 90 cm/s, Rosetta is touching the comet at the same speed that the Philae lander did in November 2014. Back then, Philae bounced across the surface for hours before finally coming to rest. Opinion is divided about whether the same will happen to Rosetta today. Some think it will come gently to rest others expect some spacecraft acrobatics to take place.</p> <p> But the kicker is that we will never know. The spacecraft will stop transmitting the moment it reaches the surface, and there are no telescopes on Earth powerful enough to see the comet\u2019s surface in detail.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57ed797ae4b035c40686bc4d\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-29T20:30:59.875Z\">9.30pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The countdown to the end of the mission is displayed on clocks throughout European mission control.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"da45dd0e764781281dfc71b3c3fcc839409a2fe5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/da45dd0e764781281dfc71b3c3fcc839409a2fe5/0_0_3264_1957/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A clock in ESA mission control shows -20hrs until the end of the mission.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">This image shows the mission clocks in the European Space Agency\u2019s mission control centre at 4.20pm 29 September 2016 with just 20 hours to go before the Rosetta spacecraft crash lands onto a comet.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: ESA/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57ed779be4b0c38a12e712ed\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-29T20:28:09.934Z\">9.28pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Today the European Space Agency\u2019s Rosetta mission comes to an end. Since August 2014, Rosetta has been studying comet 67P/Churyumov\u2013Gerasimenko in order to better understand how the Earth formed, where the water in Earth\u2019s oceans came from, and how the chemical building blocks of life were delivered to this planet. </p> <p>Rosetta is the most ambitious space mission ever launched by Europe. Indeed, it is one of the most ambitious space missions any space agency has ever launched, and it has been full of drama.</p> <p>The highpoint of the mission came in November 2014, when the Philae lander <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/across-the-universe/live/2014/nov/12/rosetta-comet-landing-live-blog\">detached from the Rosetta mothership and made its descent onto the comet</a>. A global audience watch as the lander tumbled across the surface before finally coming to rest in a crevice. Robbed of sunlight, scientists worked feverishly to complete its science mission before the batteries ran down and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/across-the-universe/live/2014/nov/14/rosetta-mission-philaes-third-day-on-comet-as-it-happens\">Philae \u2018went to sleep\u2019 three days later</a>.</p> <p>Since then, the main Rosetta spacecraft has been working, orbiting the comet and watching the way it is evaporated by the Sun. It has been making a chemical inventory that shows what molecules were delivered to the early Earth, and from which life formed. </p> <p>Today the mission comes to an end with the main spacecraft itself touching down on the comet. Rosetta will not survive the landing but will gather even more data on the way down.</p> <p>I\u2019m here in ESA\u2019s European Space Operations Centre (ESOC) in Darmstadt, Germany. Rosetta is controlled from here, and it is the natural place to draw a line under the operational phase of this mission. I was here for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/across-the-universe/2014/jan/20/rosetta-comet-chasing-spacecraft-wakes-up-esa-live-blog\">the wake-up</a> of the mission in 2014, and for the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/across-the-universe/live/2014/nov/12/rosetta-comet-landing-live-blog\">Philae landing</a>. Now, it is the end.</p> <p>Overnight the spacecraft executed a final manoeuvre that robbed it of orbital energy. It is now falling gently to its inevitable fate upon the dusty surface of the comet.</p> <p>Touchdown is expected at around 12:20 BST. <br></p> <p>During the course of today, I\u2019ll be looking back at the mission and bringing you the details of what is going on. Plus, I\u2019ll be talking to as many people as possible to bring you their reactions. To many here, the Rosetta mission has been a way of life. Today that way of life is ending.</p> <p>Stay tuned.<br></p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-09-30T08:23:59.689Z\">at 9.23am BST</time></p>  </div>",

I know exposed brick drives up the price of living spaces, especially in apartments in New York \u2026 I wonder if the resell price for bricks would affect the Supreme brick housing market? I mean, you\u2019d figure that a brick could very well go for like $60-70 resale if it\u2019s extremely hyped. That would make your house worth a little over $7m at $60 per brick. This might be a good business investment.\u201d</p> <p>Though the point or purpose of the brick might never be revealed, social media users have been quick to share their thoughts and pictures of their purchase.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-instagram\"> <blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" data-instgrm-captioned data-instgrm-version=\"7\" style=\" background:#FFF; border:0; border-radius:3px; box-shadow:0 0 1px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.5),0 1px 10px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.15); margin: 1px; max-width:658px; padding:0; width:99.375%; width:-webkit-calc(100% - 2px); width:calc(100% - 2px);\"><div style=\"padding:8px;\"> <div style=\" background:#F8F8F8; line-height:0; margin-top:40px; padding:28.1018518519% 0; text-align:center; width:100%;\"> <div style=\" background:url(data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAACwAAAAsCAMAAAApWqozAAAABGdBTUEAALGPC/xhBQAAAAFzUkdCAK7OHOkAAAAMUExURczMzPf399fX1+bm5mzY9AMAAADiSURBVDjLvZXbEsMgCES5/P8/t9FuRVCRmU73JWlzosgSIIZURCjo/ad+EQJJB4Hv8BFt+IDpQoCx1wjOSBFhh2XssxEIYn3ulI/6MNReE07UIWJEv8UEOWDS88LY97kqyTliJKKtuYBbruAyVh5wOHiXmpi5we58Ek028czwyuQdLKPG1Bkb4NnM+VeAnfHqn1k4+GPT6uGQcvu2h2OVuIf/gWUFyy8OWEpdyZSa3aVCqpVoVvzZZ2VTnn2wU8qzVjDDetO90GSy9mVLqtgYSy231MxrY6I2gGqjrTY0L8fxCxfCBbhWrsYYAAAAAElFTkSuQmCC); display:block; height:44px; margin:0 auto -44px; position:relative; top:-22px; width:44px;\"></div></div> <p style=\" margin:8px 0 0 0; padding:0 4px;\"> <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BK52LRBBIQv/\" style=\" color:#000; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; line-height:17px; text-decoration:none; word-wrap:break-word;\" target=\"_blank\">Brick \ud83d\udcf9 Oliver Payne</a></p> <p style=\" color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px; margin-bottom:0; margin-top:8px; overflow:hidden; padding:8px 0 7px; text-align:center; text-overflow:ellipsis; white-space:nowrap;\">A video posted by Supreme (@supremenewyork) on <time style=\" font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px;\" datetime=\"2016-09-28T15:00:18+00:00\">Sep 28, 2016 at 8:00am PDT</time></p></div></blockquote> <script async defer src=\"//platform.instagram.com/en_US/embeds.js\"></script> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/jiandeleon/status/781083165255405569\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Supreme brick drops tomorrow: <a href=\"https://t.co/QSg2cuGYtt\">pic.twitter.com/QSg2cuGYtt</a></p>&mdash; Jian DeLeon (@jiandeleon) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jiandeleon/status/781083165255405569\">September 28, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/_yungshrey/status/781548740037390337\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">hate your ex? but still respect him? throw a supreme brick at his window bc he can jus sell the brick to replace his window</p>&mdash; shreya (@_yungshrey) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/_yungshrey/status/781548740037390337\">September 29, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/2004brat/status/781152462694522880\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">someone beat me with a Supreme brick so i can die in style</p>&mdash; dasha \ud83d\udc79 (@2004brat) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/2004brat/status/781152462694522880\">September 28, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/sexualjumanji/status/781514113071448065\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">i was gonna buy the supreme brick drill a hole in it and make a chain and wear it everywhere</p>&mdash; sexj (@sexualjumanji) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/sexualjumanji/status/781514113071448065\">September 29, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/SoDaniel/status/781509410044731393\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">due to the nature of the material of this product there may be such imperfections as chipping and inconsistent porosity. <a href=\"https://t.co/at6Y4kMRRz\">pic.twitter.com/at6Y4kMRRz</a></p>&mdash; Daniel So (@SoDaniel) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SoDaniel/status/781509410044731393\">September 29, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/Cunn1Dan/status/781479765178023937\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Brick sold out...

  "<p>A third of last year\u2019s 10.8% murder increase in the US, the biggest single-year leap in decades, was driven by rising violence in just 10 cities, according to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/26/rate-murder-fbi-increase\">FBI data released this week</a>. </p> <p>Together, these 10 cities suffered an additional 524 murders last year, part of an estimated increase of 1,500 additional murders nationwide. </p> <p>The 10 cities did not all have the largest percentage increases in murder. Other large cities, including Aurora, Colorado, and Anchorage, Alaska, saw more dramatic percentage jumps, but only small changes in actual murder numbers. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/26/rate-murder-fbi-increase\">Murders up 10.8% in biggest percentage increase since 1971, FBI data shows</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In some of the 10 cities that saw the largest number of additional murders, law enforcement officials have attributed blame to a \u201cviral video effect\u201d or the \u201cFerguson effect\u201d, the supposed consequence of decreased police morale and assertiveness in the wake of widespread protests over police killings of black Americans.</p> <p>An alternative theory suggests the increase could be linked to a crisis in police legitimacy, murders rising as citizens\u2019 trust in and willingness to cooperate with law enforcement drops.</p> <p>Almost all of the 10 cities that saw steep increases in violence in 2015 have continued to see high levels of violence this year. Chicago has seen <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/04/chicago-gun-violence-unsolved-murders-deadly-year\">an even more dramatic increase</a>. In 2015 it saw a 16% rise in murders. This year, it has seen an additional increase of 44%.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--showcase\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/2016/09/homicide-numbers-release-2015/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/2016/09/homicide-numbers-release-2015/boot.js\" data-alt=\"Top 10 cities\"> </figure>  <p>Almost all of the 10 cities that saw big increases in murders last year have not dropped back down to lower levels of violence this year. Year-to-date homicides or murders are up 15% in Houston and 13% in Kansas City, according to local police department data. Philadelphia and Nashville have seen increases of 5% and 6%. </p> <p>Baltimore, Washington DC, Milwaukee and St Louis have seen slightly fewer homicides or murders in 2016, but not enough to put them back on track towards lower murder numbers.</p> <p>Nor are murder numbers the only measure of increasing violence. Baltimore and Washington are both on track to see about the same number of non-fatal shootings or assaults with a deadly weapon as in 2015, even though killings are slightly down.</p> <p>Chicago is an outlier, with at least 160 additional murders and 800 additional shooting incidents in 2016 compared with the same time the previous year.</p> <p>The 10 cities that helped drive 2015\u2019s murder increase have some demographic similarities. A <a href=\"https://www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles1/nij/249895.pdf\">justice department-funded study</a> of 2015 homicide trends in big cities found that the 10 cities with the largest murder increases all had larger African American populations and smaller Hispanic populations than other cities. Those cities also had slightly higher average poverty rates: 24.6% versus 20.8%. (Rather than Oklahoma City, the 10 cities analyzed in that study included Cleveland, which has a much higher proportion of black residents.) </p> <h2>\u2018Longstanding grievances and discontent with policing\u2019</h2> <p>Richard Rosenfeld, a criminologist and the study\u2019s author, concluded that there might be some connection between protests over police violence and increases in murders in cities with large African American populations. Rather than suggesting, as some conservative proponents of a \u201cFerguson effect\u201d have done, that such might undermine public safety, Rosenfeld focused on the \u201clongstanding grievances and discontent with policing in African American communities\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cIn this interpretation, when activated by controversial incidents of police use of force, chronic discontent erupts into violence,\u201d he wrote. </p> <p>Exactly how this hypothesized \u201clegitimacy crisis\u201d might work \u2013 how frustration over police killings might translate into more community violence, and which individuals might therefore act differently \u2013 is unclear, Rosenfeld wrote. </p> <p>In Chicago on Monday, US attorney Zach Fardon said that though \u201cno one knows for sure\u201d why violence has spiked in the city, the timing of the spike closely followed the release of video of <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/nov/25/laquan-mcdonald-video-chicago-police-shooting-questions-remain\">the police killing of 17-year-old Laquan McDonald</a>.</p> <p>The McDonald case has prompted the firing of the police superintendent, a crisis of public confidence in Mayor Rahm Emmanuel and a US justice department investigation of the police department for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/04/chicago-gun-violence-unsolved-murders-deadly-year\">potential civil rights violations</a> regarding racial disparities in use of force.</p> <p>\u201cThe fallout in public confidence, the apparent embattlement of police on all fronts has created a sense of emboldment [sic] among gangs, especially in our most violence-afflicted neighborhoods,\u201d Fardon said.</p> <p>\u201cSome gang members apparently have felt they can get away with more and so bullets started flying.\u201d</p> <p>Chicago has seen what some observers have called a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/mar/25/chicago-guns-child-execution-tyshawn-lee-gang-violence\">perfect storm</a> of factors that contribute to violence. These have included a state budget crisis; cuts in funding for summer jobs, mental healthcare and a citywide gang violence prevention program; a <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-chicago-police-idUSKCN10Z13A\">shrunken force</a> of police detectives; drops in official measures of proactive policing efforts, including stops and overall arrests; and a clearance rate for non-fatal shootings that has fallen to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/04/chicago-gun-violence-unsolved-murders-deadly-year\">under 4%</a>.</p> <p>In most of the city\u2019s 2,600 shooting incidents so far this year, there have been no arrests.</p> <p>Fardon\u2019s suggestion that Chicago\u2019s increase in violence could be linked to falling morale among police officers and thus reduced willingness to conduct stops, and a related \u201cemboldment\u201d of gang members, echoes <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/oct/26/fbi-director-ferguson-effect-crime-policing-james-comey\">comments by James Comey</a> in which the FBI director has linked increases in violence in cities across the country to changes in police behavior.</p> <p>Comey has suggested that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/26/rate-murder-fbi-increase\">murder increases</a> might be linked to \u201cmarginal pullbacks by lots and lots of police officers\u201d, in the face of continued protests over police killings of black Americans.</p> <p>The Obama administration, however, has repeatedly disputed any link between protests for police reform and increases in murder, with the attorney general, Loretta Lynch, saying there is \u201cno data\u201d to support the theory that a \u201c<a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/may/13/ferguson-effect-real-researcher-richard-rosenfield-second-thoughts\">Ferguson effect</a>\u201d is behind the dramatic increase in murders in 2015, the biggest single-year percentage increase in 45 years.</p> <h2>Enough to prove a crime trend?</h2> <p>In a <a href=\"https://www.brennancenter.org/sites/default/files/publications/Crime_2016_Preliminary_Analysis.pdf\">report on 2016 murder trends</a> in big cities, the Brennan Center for Justice considered several factors that might help explain murder increases in some cities, including economic factors, shrinking police forces and a \u201cdecrease in police legitimacy\u201d.</p> <p>Another theory the report proposed was that \u201ccities with long-term socioeconomic problems (high poverty, unemployment and racial segregation) are more prone to short-term spikes in crime.\u201d</p> <p>The Brennan Center analysis, based on mid-year crime data from the 30 largest US cities, projected an additional 13.1% increase in the murder rate in 2016, for a cumulative 31.5% increase from 2014 to 2016. Half of the murders propelling that increase would be attributable to Baltimore, Chicago and Houston, the report projected. </p> <p>Experts caution that violence trends are intensely local and that changes in reported crime can be driven by so many factors that it is very difficult to isolate what is causing any increase or decrease. Whether the 10.8% increase in national murder numbers in 2015 was driven by any national or local factors is still far from clear. </p> <p>One year of data or even two is not enough to prove a crime trend, criminologists say. </p> <p>Some cities that share demographic similarities with the cities on the top 10 list \u2013large proportions of African American residents, high poverty rates, historic struggles with gun violence, local activism against police violence towards black Americans \u2013 did not see big increases in murder in 2015. </p> <p>Detroit still has one of the country\u2019s highest murder rates, but it saw its murders stay mostly flat, with three fewer than in 2014. Oakland, which continues to see large protests against police violence, saw only five additional murders in 2015. </p> <p>A closer look at the 10 cities with the largest murder increases also reveals sharp differences in their longer-term crime trends. For some cities, including Baltimore and Milwaukee, the 2015 murder spike was sharp and historic, pushing both cities to levels of violence they had not seen since the 1990s. </p> <p>For others, like Philadelphia, the 2015 increase came after several years of historic lows in murders, following a sharp decrease in 2013. Even with last year\u2019s increases, Philadelphia\u2019s murder rate is still lower than it was in 2008. </p> <p>St Louis followed a third, more troubling trend. Its relatively modest murder uptick in 2015 followed years of previous increases, a trend that <a href=\"http://sentencingproject.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Ferguson-Effect.pdf\">predated the killing of Michael Brown</a> in Ferguson. </p> <p>St Louis now has the highest murder rate in the country. Its murder rate has increased more than 60% since 2000. <br></p> <p>Only half of the 2015 increase in murders was concentrated in cities with a population of more than 250,000, according to FBI data. This means that smaller cities across the country, which typically have lower murder rates, also saw an estimated increase of more than 700 murders last year.</p> <p><em>Additional reporting by Ciara McCarthy</em><br></p>",

It confirmed what <a href=\"http://blackactivistsrisingagainstcuts.blogspot.co.uk/2016/09/2025-vision-for-race-equality-in.html\" title=\"\">my organisation</a>, Barac, had been saying for years: that in all aspects of life, BAME people face discrimination and disadvantage. The urgent need for a strategic approach to eradicate racism is nothing new to the black community, but what support and help can we expect from the rejuvenated labour movement?</p> <p>Over the past six years of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/austerity\" title=\"\">austerity</a>, we have seen amplified racism and deepening poverty for BAME communities. The EHRC is itself <a href=\"https://www.parliament.uk/edm/2016-17/382\" title=\"\">facing further cuts</a>, meaning that there could be only three case workers nationally to support those who experience racism. Its budget has already been cut by 69% since 2010. Given the rise in hate crime post-Brexit, this is deeply worrying.&#xa0;</p> <p>John McDonnell MP, shadow chancellor, has said that a Labour government led by Jeremy Corbyn would repeal the divisive <a href=\"http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2016/19/contents/enacted\" title=\"\">Immigration Act</a>. Last week a motion was passed at the annual <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/11/the-guardian-view-on-the-tuc-congress-are-you-listening-mrs-may\" title=\"\">Trades Union Congress</a>, where I spoke, opposing the act.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/28/corbyn-urges-labour-mps-to-end-trench-warfare-and-back-socialist-vision-for-uk\">Corbyn urges Labour MPs to end 'trench warfare' and back socialist vision for UK</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But the Labour movement has not always stood up for migrants to the UK. The TUC failed to oppose the Commonwealth Immigrants Act in 1968 and the Immigration Act in 1971, which further restricted immigration from Commonwealth countries. Black organisations, including the Indian Workers Association (IWA), led the campaign against the growing imposition of immigration controls, in particular the 1962 commonwealth immigrants bill, which sought to restrict the entry into Britain of black migrants from Commonwealth countries. The IWA, in conjunction with other bodies such as the <a href=\"http://www.wisc.btck.co.uk/\" title=\"\">West Indian Standing Conference</a> and the Standing Conference of Pakistan, joined to fight this legislation.</p> <p>And then there was the <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-23795655\" title=\"\">colour bar imposed in 1963 by the Bristol Omnibus Company</a>, endorsed by the then TGWU union. In 1955 the Passenger Group of the TGWU had passed a resolution that \u201ccoloured\u201d workers should not be employed on the buses. The TGWU said that \u201cif one black man steps on the platform as a conductor, every wheel will stop\u201d. Community activists, part of the West Indian Development Council, came together with civil rights campaigner Paul Stephenson and led the Bristol bus boycott, inspired by Rosa Parks and the successful bus boycott in Montgomery, Alabama. They were subsequently supported by students and the local MP, Tony Benn. The boycott is considered to have greatly influenced the introduction of the first race relations legislation in the UK.</p> <p>More than 50 years after the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2005/nov/10/race.immigrationpolicy\" title=\"\">Race Relations Act</a> was passed, we are now in danger of passing on a worse future to the next generation of young BAME people than that inherited by their parents.</p> <p>Historically, grassroots black campaigners have had to organise outside the labour movement to challenge racism. This only changed following the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/gallery/2010/jan/20/grunwick-strike-women\" title=\"\">Grunwick strike</a>, when in 1976 a group of Asian and Caribbean women walked out to protest against their working conditions. The year-long strike was historically significant as the first dispute of black workers that attracted mass support from the trade union movement. This eventually led to the establishment of black sections and structures within several trade unions, and in the Labour party, which were seen as highly controversial. Despite opposition from the Labour leader, Neil Kinnock, the black sections motion was passed by the 1983 Labour party conference and the party, alongside several public sector unions, established black caucuses or sections as part of their internal structures. However, black activists had to fight for self-organised structures in unions, with the initial response being to form race equality advisory committees. Those black structures, together with the TUC race relations committee and via the annual TUC Black Workers Conference, have done a lot to keep race on the trade union agenda.</p> <p>Since then trade unions and communities have not naturally come together to campaign against racism. However, the economic crisis and the establishment of anti-austerity coalitions concerned with the combined impact of cuts on workers, service users and communities, has seen more cooperation between equality organisations seeking to have a voice in broader movements. An example was the successful campaign to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jun/21/rubbishing-mary-seacole-hide-black-contributions-britain\" title=\"\">keep Mary Seacole</a> and other black historical figures on the national curriculum in 2013, led by a small group of grassroots and trade union activists, supported by many Labour MPs.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2016/sep/28/jeremy-corbyns-labour-conference-speech-video-highlights\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/553fe\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2758226\"            data-video-name=\"Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s Labour conference speech - video highlights\"            data-video-provider=\"ITN\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-57ebee65e4b01b56deffc4f8\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/09/28/160928corbyncongress_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/09/28/160928corbyncongress.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/09/28/160928corbyncongress_WebM.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2016/sep/28/jeremy-corbyns-labour-conference-speech-video-highlights\">Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s Labour conference speech</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>Under the leadership of Jeremy Corbyn, who has a track record of supporting campaigns against racism and race injustice over decades, we have a real chance of strengthening the links between the black grassroots movements and the wider labour movement.</p> <p>Barac has produced a strategy document proposing how this could work which was launched at the Labour party fringe conference The World Transformed.</p> <p>It calls on signatories to declare their commitment to equality of opportunity and freedom from discrimination on the grounds of race, religion and ethnicity, and for all citizens to be able live without fear.

  "<p>When <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/michelleobama\">Michelle Obama</a> gets on the microphone, the world listens. Her <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/26/michelle-obama-convention-speech-female-president\">speech at the Democratic convention</a> in July was judged by many to be the best of the week, reaching the emotional and inspirational heights that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton\">Hillary Clinton</a>\u2019s presidential campaign has sometimes struggled to achieve. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ln3wAdRAim4\">Her turn on Carpool Karaoke</a> with James Corden this summer, singing Beyonc\u00e9 and Stevie Wonder, has, at the time of writing, been watched nearly 44m times on YouTube.</p> <p>But for most of the eight years she has lived in the White House, there has been no microphone. Obama is seen a good deal more than she is heard, so how she looks has taken on disproportionate significance. Her image sets the emotional tone for the White House, becoming a symbolic ideal for other women, for other wives and mothers. Every new hairstyle has been combed as a cipher for a change in the national mood; every dress evaluated for the values it embodies.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ec8fa43ccccf93d78c964eaf1dc5917ae162c445\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ec8fa43ccccf93d78c964eaf1dc5917ae162c445/0_0_1920_1080/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Michelle Obama on Carpool Karaoke with James Corden\" width=\"1000\" height=\"563\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Obama\u2019s Carpool Karaoke with James Corden.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: CBS via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There is no denying that this feels retrograde for a woman of Obama\u2019s intellect and background. There is a call-and-response rhythm to this kind of coverage, with every fashion feature on her wardrobe triggering an opinion piece raging at this unbefitting treatment of a high-achieving lawyer with degrees from Harvard and Princeton. Yet, contrary to what many expected, Obama herself has played the role in a notably traditional key. In contrast to her predecessor Hillary Clinton\u2019s battles over public healthcare, she has adopted relatively uncontroversial causes: family nutrition, childhood health and girls\u2019 education, issues that sit neatly around her self-proclaimed identity as Mom-In-Chief. While these causes are, perhaps, more culturally loaded than they first appear \u2013 the campaign against childhood obesity has a more progressive slant when you take into account the fact that the issue disproportionately affects low-income and black families \u2013 they have frustrated those who hoped for a more radical rewrite.</p> <p>Obama has followed in the first lady tradition by putting fashion centre stage of her public persona. On the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/nov/05/uselections2008-barackobama\">night of her husband\u2019s election to office</a> in 2008, she wore a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/nov/17/michelleobama-fashion\">Narciso Rodriguez dress</a> in a fiery red-and-black speckle pattern. The fashion press reported the pattern as \u201cd\u00e9grad\u00e9\u201d, while others went with \u201clava lamp\u201d. To wear a very eye-catching dress at such a moment made it clear that Obama had no intention of allowing the White House to cramp her style. She had broken an unspoken rule of modern culture, which holds that a serious person must have a sober wardrobe.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"ac266b583f634848b00dd527af66700f9ca227c6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ac266b583f634848b00dd527af66700f9ca227c6/88_44_1148_2317/495.jpg\" alt=\"Michelle Obama in a controversial Narciso Rodriguez dress at Barack\u2019s first election night victory rally in 2008\" width=\"495\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Michelle Obama wore a controversial Narciso Rodriguez dress at Barack\u2019s election night victory rally in 2008.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Stan Honda/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Until Obama, the iconography of the first lady revolved around <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/jackie-onassis\">Jackie Kennedy</a>. There had been glamorous president\u2019s wives since \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/mar/06/nancy-reagan\">Nancy Reagan</a> with her <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2011/apr/26/your-next-box-set-dynasty\">Dynasty</a> gowns, say \u2013 but the notion of first lady chic remained almost synonymous with that sunny yet streamlined early-1960s style that is for ever Camelot. Half a century later, wives of heads of state all over the world are still measured against Kennedy, but the comparison is sharpest in the White House. Where her predecessors had tiptoed around the edges of Kennedy style, as if anxious to avoid the comparison, Obama has embraced many elements of the look and made them her own. The sleeveless shift dresses she favours are a direct link, as are the outsize strings of pearls, often framed by wide-set necklines. Even elements of the two women\u2019s hair and makeup are similar, despite their physical difference: note the full, stiffly curled hair and the penchant for false eyelashes.</p> <p>The Kennedys represent an American ideal that is classy and democratic, and Obama has used fashion to ally herself and her husband with that same message. The visual connection with the Kennedys draws the eye to the obvious difference: their skin colour. It\u2019s a way of emphasising the historic nature of the Obamas as the first black family to live in the White House, while at the same time telling the world that this family, and this administration, is traditionally American.</p> <p>At the first inauguration, in January 2009, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/jan/20/michelle-obama-isabel-toledo-sasha-malia\">Obama wore a dress and matching coat in an unusual shade of pale greenish yellow</a> that observers struggled to put a name to. (The Guardian went with lemongrass.) Her elder daughter, Malia, wore a purple coat with black scarf and gloves; her younger daughter, Sasha, a pink coat with orange scarf and gloves. The colours made for a dazzlingly confident family portrait. Other elements of the look were formal, even traditional (the first lady\u2019s sleek leather gloves, the two girls in their cosy, buttoned-up coats), but the colours were modern, the cheery brights of a holiday snap rather than the sepia tones of an official photograph. That was the day Obama took first lady chic and made it modern and down-to-earth. Later that year, on a state visit to Britain, she wore an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2013/sep/20/azzedine-alaia-fashion-favourite-maverick\">Azzedine Ala\u00efa</a> cardigan to meet the Queen. \u201cYou don\u2019t go to Buckingham Palace in a sweater,\u201d <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/04/03/oscar-de-la-renta-slams-m_n_182807.html\">sniffed the designer Oscar de la Renta</a> \u2013 but he was already out of touch. Obama\u2019s approachable, real-life wardrobe had struck a chord.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7c97e3a079fa6f3e8e23484f3926a67e1525a029\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7c97e3a079fa6f3e8e23484f3926a67e1525a029/0_0_2600_2091/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Michelle Obama wearing a black cardigan to meet the Queen and Prince Philip with Barack in 2009\" width=\"1000\" height=\"804\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Obama was criticised for wearing a cardigan to meet the Queen.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: John Stillwell/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Without wearing a single outfit that could be considered truly rule-breaking, Obama has rewritten the playbook. In early 2009, when the first lady\u2019s official website was launched featuring a photo of her wearing a sleeveless dress, the Chicago Tribune reported that it had received hundreds of online responses, many of which criticised the look for its inappropriate informality. Since then, the trend for the sleeveless dress as grownup but fun, dressy but comfortable \u2013 fuelled, in huge part, by Obama herself \u2013 has grown and grown. She made it OK for a middle-aged woman to wear a dress showcasing arms that speak of serious push-ups, as well as those signature warm Mobama hugs. In that sense, she represents a generation growing old in a different way. Many of her fashion choices \u2013 from the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/feb/15/michelle-obama-fashion-week\">girlish, bridal Jason Wu gown</a> she wore for the first inauguration to the full skirts she often favours for daytime \u2013 are looks that not long ago would have been thought too young, too cute, for a woman in her 50s to carry off. Instead, she has captured something of the confidence of a generation who will not accept that they should slip into the shadows.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"bf8c7564a3c90bf44b4ab1b5ee288bb17cd5f3bf\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bf8c7564a3c90bf44b4ab1b5ee288bb17cd5f3bf/121_154_2197_3341/658.jpg\" alt=\"Obama in a girlish, bridal Jason Wu gown at the first inaugural ball in 2009.\" width=\"658\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Obama wore a girlish, bridal Jason Wu gown for the first inaugural ball in 2009.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Saul Loeb/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Obama has consistently played down any interest in fashion. \u201cIt\u2019s so hard. I\u2019m kind of a tomboy-jock at heart, but I like to look nice,\u201d she told ABC news in 2008. But she has steered her image carefully nonetheless. When she appeared on the <a href=\"http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2009-02-10-vogue_cover_michelle_obama.jpg\">cover of American Vogue in March 2009</a>, she did it on condition that the choice of dress was hers, without input from the Vogue team, and that she used her own hair and makeup stylists, something the magazine had not agreed to before. Even the designer and film-maker <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/tom-ford\">Tom Ford</a>, renowned for his control freak tendencies, alluded to Obama\u2019s strictures in a <a href=\"http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/features/tom-ford-designer-turned-director-925601\">recent interview with the Hollywood Reporter</a>, when he related the experience of dressing the first lady for an audience with the Queen in 2011. \u201cDoing something like that is easy because you\u2019re dictated to,\u201d he said. \u201c\u2018She needs to wear that colour, she has to have gloves, she doesn\u2019t like this, she doesn\u2019t like that.\u2019 It\u2019s pretty simple.\u201d</p> <p>Simple, but strategic. Obama\u2019s mastery of fashion is less about the clothes than about a modern woman\u2019s innate understanding that visual messaging is a crucial part of public life. As she <a href=\"http://www.instyle.com/reviews-coverage/michelle-obama-style-social-media\">told American InStyle magazine</a> last month, \u201cWe can fool ourselves into thinking that everybody is still watching the evening news, but I live with Generation Z, and I know that their habits, the way they take in information, are so different\u2026 We\u2019ve got to meet our constituents where they are, and they\u2019re on Snapchat.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.snapchat.com/add/michelleobama\">Obama has been on Snapchat since June</a>. <a href=\"http://www.usatoday.com/story/life/entertainthis/2016/06/21/michelle-obama-joins-snapchat-teases-upcoming-carpool-karaoke-ride/86191730/\">Her opening post</a>?

Some have run drug, prostitution and weapons sale rings from their adopted homes. Others have started fires and slowly stripped houses of all resalable items.</p> <p>This scourge of illegal occupancies is the lasting legacy of the region\u2019s housing collapse of nearly a decade ago, which at the time left more than 80% of homes in southern Nevada underwater, a figure three times the national rate. Today, more than 2%, or nearly 14,000 homes, sit vacant in southern Clark County; the national average is 1.6%.</p> <p>Las Vegas metropolitan police, which patrol an area of nearly two million residents, have seen a 25% leap in the last three years in calls for service regarding suspected squatters, up to nearly 5,000 annually. In North Las Vegas, a city with 200,000 residents, officers have worked to remove trespassers from 180 homes in the last year alone.</p> <p>Now, authorities are upping their game with new laws and more aggressive enforcement.</p> <p>North Las Vegas has created a taskforce of police, code enforcement and utilities officials that have developed ways to red flag foreclosed vacant houses before squatters get a chance to move in.</p> <p>A new law approved by the state legislature last year now brings possible jail time for such offenses as housebreaking and forcibly entering a vacant home to take up residence or letting someone else live there without the owner\u2019s consent.</p> <p>Victoria Seaman, a Nevada assemblywoman and real estate agent who helped sponsor the new anti-squatter law, said Nevada is leading the nation in tough new housebreaking laws.</p> <p>\u201cThis is a problem nationwide, but no more so than here,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re hearing from other states who want to jump onboard with similar laws.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4d323f4489680f5acd3365fa93871ff3581a24a8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4d323f4489680f5acd3365fa93871ff3581a24a8/0_139_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"North Las Vegas police officers Alain Villanueva and Scott Vaughn investigate a possible squatter residence.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">North Las Vegas police officers Alain Villanueva and Scott Vaughn investigate a possible squatter residence.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Becker/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Romina Wilson, business services manager for the North Las Vegas utilities department, has seen most of the tricks scammers use.</p> <p>Many times, the owner\u2019s name is wrong or humorously misspelled on the boilerplate lease.

Vaughn arrested a mother with five children, aged two to 11, who squatted in a house for eight months, the last five without water. Neighbors spotted her jumping fences at night to steal water.</p> <p>\u201cThe grandmother took custody of the kids, and was flabbergasted her daughter could allow them to live this way,\u201d he said. \u201cWe were both flabbergasted.\u201d</p> <p>On a recent week day, Vaughn and Officer Allen Villanueva were busy.</p> <p>After the stop on Ocotillo Mesa, another tip from a neighbor led the patrolmen to a house inhabited by four suspected squatters.</p> <p>After questioning, two men were arrested for unrelated warrants, and the women dragged their belongings out to the street, as city workers bolted the doors behind them.</p> <p>\u201cWhen I go home to the neighborhood I\u2019ve chosen for a safe environment,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m satisfied that I\u2019ve helped provide that safe environment for someone else.\u201d</p>",

A large part of this is down to a significant decline in negative attitudes among the over-65s. </p> <p>\u201cAlthough older people are still more likely to express prejudiced views, the age gap has narrowed since 2010. This is a positive step towards a more inclusive Scotland. However, our research still shows relatively high levels of prejudice towards some groups in society, such as people who cross-dress, those who have undergone gender reassignment and Gypsy/Travellers.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>In the early 18th century, Naples was the operatic capital of Europe, attracting composers not only from Italy but from the whole continent to write for the army of castrati that populated the city\u2019s stages. Many of the musicians who worked there have slipped from view over time, but their achievements were surveyed by countertenor <a href=\"http://www.cencic.com/\">Max Emanuel Cencic</a> in a Wigmore recital of extraordinary beauty with <a href=\"http://www.il-pomodoro.ch/\">Il Pomo d\u2019Oro</a> and their harpsichordist-conductor <a href=\"http://emelyanychevenglish.blogspot.co.uk/p/blog-page.html]\">Maxim Emelyanychev</a>.</p> <p> Cencic combines flamboyance with great intelligence. The man who struts his stuff in dazzling platform gear \u2013 skin-tight white trousers and an elaborate brocade jacket \u2013 has rescued many Neapolitan composers from obscurity, and single-handedly forced a reappraisal of the music of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonardo_Vinci\">Leonardo Vinci</a>, whom Handel regarded as a rival. More to the point, he possesses one of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQ0suHtkOTM\">the truly great voices</a>, dark in tone and astoundingly agile, enabling him to tackle his chosen repertory with formidable grace and bravura.</p> <p> An aria from Vinci\u2019s Eraclea displayed coloratura of breathtaking accuracy over a wide vocal and dynamic range. He delivered the long lines of No, Non Vedete Mai from <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvVcVm1_5QU\">Leonardo Leo\u2019s Siface</a> with impeccable breath control and effortless leaps from his lower to upper registers. He brought the evening to a close with one of his party pieces, Qual Turbine Che Scende from Porpora\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=47PpdQvZvqQ\">Germanico in Germania</a>, sung with considerable drive and a fierce intensity. Not all of it was showy: an aria from Alessandro Scarlatti\u2019s Il Prigioniero Fortunato, accompanied by continuo and solo viola, was striking in its introverted simplicity.</p> <p> Il Pomo d\u2019Oro remain a classy period ensemble, though they play with less overt panache since Emelyanychev took over as director from the fiery violinist-conductor Riccardo Minasi. Their contributions, when Cencic was taking a breather, were variable. Hasse\u2019s Grave and Fuga in G minor impressed with its dark, rasping severity.

You will score points by passing through doorways to collect fish, and with the penguin models weighted to allow for dramatic curves and rolls, it\u2019s possible to pull off some impressive trick shots, even launching your<strong> </strong>figure into the air to leap over walls or rival penguins that get in your way.<br></p> <p>Each round also sees one player take on the role of the \u201ccatcher\u201d, attempting to score points by colliding with other penguins. The end result feels like a blend of a furious race, a frantic game of tag and a tipsy night around the pool table at the student union. Yes, it\u2019s a bit gimmicky, but if you\u2019re after something quick and silly with huge toy appeal,<strong> </strong>then Ice Cool is great fun for kids, or for unashamedly immature grown-ups.<br></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQ0QpJk3Yew\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/dQ0QpJk3Yew?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>Ice Cool in action.</figcaption> </figure>   <h2>Ticket to Ride: Rails and Sails</h2> <p><strong>2-5 players, 90-120 minutes<br>RRP: \u00a359.99</strong></p> <p>Family-friendly train game Ticket to Ride is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/blog/2014/oct/27/all-aboard-how-ticket-to-ride-helped-save-table-top-gaming\">one of board gaming\u2019s great success stories</a>. Since its release in 2004, it\u2019s sold more than 3m copies, and over the years it\u2019s spawned a series of spin-offs allowing players to build rail empires in different locations around the world. <a href=\"https://www.daysofwonder.com/tickettoride/en/rails-and-sails/\">Rails and Sails</a> is designer Alan R Moon\u2019s latest take on the game\u2019s popular card-based formula, and it takes things to a new and much grander scale, with players competing on a global map to build worldwide networks of railways and shipping lanes.<br></p> <p>If you have played previous games in the series, you will find the core of the game largely unchanged. Players collect cards to claim routes on the board, secretly aiming to connect certain locations on the map to score bonus points. You\u2019ll attempt to find the most efficient routes between cities and to block off the connections your opponents desperately need. The biggest change, though, is that you will need different types of cards to claim land- or sea-based routes. In effect, you\u2019re building two separate networks, and it feels a lot like playing two games of Ticket to Ride simultaneously.</p> <p>It\u2019s a more mentally taxing take on the original game\u2019s premise, but unfortunately it doesn\u2019t take long for this edition to come off the rails. The requirement to collect different cards means that you can spend several turns fishing for the ones you need before you\u2019re actually able to do anything, and it soon becomes frustrating. Rails and Sails adds length and complexity, but it offers little new in terms of gameplay.</p> <p>If you\u2019re new to Ticket to Ride, this isn\u2019t the place to jump aboard; you\u2019ll have much more fun with the original game. If you\u2019re already a fan, the existing map pack expansions bring more variety and better value for money.

There\u2019s little in the way of actual interaction between players, meaning that it can feel as though everyone at the table is immersed in their own individual game. While there are multiple deck-building strategies to choose from, it won\u2019t take long to discover them all.

It was Luke Cage\u2019s showrunner, Cheo Hodari Coker, who first hinted at the heavy symbolism in the latest Netflix show about \u201cstreet-level\u201d superheroes, when he announced at Comic-Con that \u201cthe world is ready for a bulletproof black man\u201d. It\u2019s no coincidence that Marvel\u2019s latest TV superhero wears a plain old hoodie, just as Trayvon Martin did, rather than a colourful cape, nor that the show is set in Harlem, often considered the heartland of black America.</p> <p>In 1972, Cage became Marvel\u2019s first black superhero to get his own comic-book. Back then he was classic Blaxploitation \u2013 all open-chested yellow jacket, chain belt and steel tiara (its purpose never explained). Now he\u2019s the first African-American superhero with his own show, after appearing as the paramour of Jessica Jones in last year\u2019s hit Netflix series of the same name. </p> <p>And the 2016 Luke Cage may just be the most subversive TV superhero yet. He\u2019s a warm-hearted symbol of black power, a public rebuke to those who judge by skin colour. When we first meet him, Cage is struggling to pay the rent in menial jobs at his local barbershop and a nightclub, living hand-to-mouth in gentrifying Harlem. But the death of an innocent loved one, the avuncular barbershop owner Pops, sees him find his inner hero. Soon, he becomes the scourge of the district\u2019s dealers, thugs and crooked politicians.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"fdce281e47e76fdf13cf9d2093364f048f5e65cf\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fdce281e47e76fdf13cf9d2093364f048f5e65cf/0_0_4240_2545/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Penniless superhero \u2026 when we meet him, Cage is struggling to pay the rent, living hand-to-mouth in gentrifying Harlem.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Penniless superhero \u2026 when we meet him, Cage is struggling to pay the rent, living hand-to-mouth in gentrifying Harlem.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Myles Aronowitz/Netflix</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Colter, whose big break came in 2004 as the boxer \u201cBig\u201d Willie Little alongside Hilary Swank in Million Dollar Baby, says he was initially suspicious of the role.

But the show\u2019s strength lies in that slow-burn intrigue, as well as its soulful vision of African-American culture. Every time the camera visits villain Cottonmouth\u2019s slick nightclub, Paradise, there\u2019s another legend on stage, from Charles Bradley and Faith Evans to Raphael Saadiq.</p> <p>It\u2019s no surprise that this is where Cage meets supercool cop Misty Knight (newcomer Simone Missick), a staple of the comics who could well be the show\u2019s breakout character. She may have lost her bionic arm in the 2016 update, but it\u2019s made up for with a superpower that allows her to mentally rearrange crime scenes in real time. Other transfers from the comics include \u201cShades\u201d Alvarez (Sons of Anarchy\u2019s Theo Rossi), a devious criminal operator who never takes his sunglasses off, and Cottonmouth himself (Mahershala Ali), a super-smooth Biggie Smalls-obsessed drug lord. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b4921ee8d08090012c1e7c4aa8af36fafe6e7aac\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b4921ee8d08090012c1e7c4aa8af36fafe6e7aac/198_0_3972_2384/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Across 110th street \u2026 everyone in Luke Cage\u2019s Harlem is unutterably cool.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Across 110th street \u2026 everyone in Luke Cage\u2019s Harlem is unutterably cool.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Myles Aronowitz/Netflix</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It seems that anyone who crosses Manhattan\u2019s 110th Street becomes unutterably cool.

In one scene, Cage marches into a local hoodlum\u2019s hideout to destroy a stash of weapons. As he\u2019s about to leave, the penniless superhero spots a brand new hoodie lying in the corner and politely asks the shellshocked victims of his vigilante activity if they happen to have one in his size. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d315280a031e10a89988dcbd1faf76b9701b5705\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d315280a031e10a89988dcbd1faf76b9701b5705/0_117_2822_1694/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Mr Invincible \u2026 it\u2019s the mix of crime drama and comic-book silliness that makes Luke Cage must-view TV.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mr Invincible \u2026 it\u2019s the mix of crime drama and comic-book silliness that makes Luke Cage must-view TV.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Myles Aronowitz/Netflix</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It\u2019s this mix of comic-book silliness and crime drama that makes Luke Cage must-view TV. But Coker has also woven a deeper sense of history into the show\u2019s architecture. Poke your head inside Pop\u2019s barbershop and you might find yourself party to conversations about local luminaries like Geoffrey Canada or Percy Sutton, civil-rights activist heroes who lifted up Harlem long before Luke Cage came to town. </p> <p>The show also features a largely black cast, which is a rarity for comic book-based material. And while Colter may be reticent about the idea his bulletproof black hero can bring societal change, Missick who plays Misty is more optimistic.\u201cIf you look at the civil rights movement in the 1960s and Black Lives Matter right now, the discussion going on about police brutality in America \u2026 change came from people outside that community identifying it was a problem and creating legislation,\u201d she says. \u201cThis show highlights a lot of the issues in the black community, and it will, perhaps, enact change in unlikely places.

  "<p>Television loves a good zeitgeist to latch onto \u2013 but, as trends go, marijuana is hardly new, with the first recorded use of it dating way back into the BC era. So why are small screen execs suddenly obsessed with it? Breakout hit High Maintenance has just been commissioned for a second season on HBO, while at least four other major shows are in development. The legalisation of the drug in Alaska, Colorado, Washington and Oregon is clearly having an influence, but is that all it is? Or have attitudes to cannabis on TV been changing for longer than that?</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/sep/16/high-maintenance-hbo-vimeo-series-fall-tv\">High Maintenance: a cult favorite makes it to the mainstream</a> </p> </aside>  <p>For years, marijuana was portrayed as either an evil gateway drug or as a prop to signify that the character using it was a hopeless, lazy slacker. While drug use on TV is not regulated by FCC rules, there are certain moral guidelines that networks were obliged to uphold, at least before 10pm (if only to fend off the inevitable viewer complaints). When the counter culture movement was thoroughly under way, the small screen dealt with it in one of three ways: ignoring it altogether, actively preaching against it (the sole reason Dragnet returned in the 60s was to preach against the drug-using youths of the era) or portraying it slyly, as exemplified by Scooby Doo\u2019s perma-stoned heroes, Shaggy and Scooby, who made their TV debut long before Cheech and Chong showed up in the 70s.</p> <p>By the 1980s Miami Vice was tackling drugs and Nancy Reagan was making a bizarre cameo in Diff\u2019rent Strokes to promote the Just Say No campaign. In the 1990s, we had cringeworthy special Cartoon All-Stars To The Rescue!, which saw Alf and the Muppet Babies teach a pot-smoking teenager how to say no to drugs. But by the early 90s, cannabis was no longer shocking, and the obligatory \u201cdrugs\u201d episodes of Roseanne, Home Improvement, Blossom and even Dinosaurs were less effective at fear-mongering (although even as late as 1997, family drama 7th Heaven was telling people that weed ruins your life).</p> <p>For a long time any show that wanted to be positive about the issue had to side-step it, like That 70s Show, where the characters got stoned without a single spliff being seen on screen. Weeds marked a change in attitudes when it debuted in 2005, but that focused heavily on the illegality of Nancy Botwin\u2019s actions, painting her as an anti-hero. </p> <p>As attitudes towards weed soften and with it being decriminalized \u2013 if not quite legalized \u2013 in many more US states, the depiction of marijuana on TV is changing. Now we see characters using it in the same way that you\u2019d previously show characters having a drink; it\u2019s a recreational activity that doesn\u2019t have any moralizing attached to it. Characters in Girls, Broad City, Mr Robot and more smoke, without it leading to a worthy storyline about addiction or a descent into crime. </p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75CATcJo9MU\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/75CATcJo9MU?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>HBO has set the bar high by turning web series High Maintenance into a hit show this month. Each episode tells a different story, featuring different characters, all linked by the unnamed man who delivers their weed (played by Ben Sinclair, the co-creator of the show along with Katja Blichfeld). The characters all smoke, but that\u2019s not the main focus. The series tells stories that are by turn sweet, funny, dark and a bit gross, but all of them dig deep into the core of humanity. The show is brilliantly unexpected \u2013 the first episode provides a wonderful subversion of the friendship between a gay man and a straight woman \u2013 but the weed is simply a device to explore these disparate characters. And no one is ever judged for wanting to get high.</p> <p>Amazon has just greenlit the pilot episode of Budding Prospects, a comedy about weed farmers in 1983 from the director of Bad Santa, and they had also previously announced that they had Highland in development, a series starring Margaret Cho as an addict who leaves rehab and moves in with her family \u2013 who run a pot dispensary.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/sep/29/jerry-springer-show-fistfights-fetishes-farm-animals\">The Jerry Springer Show turns 25: the 10 most outrageous moments</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Netflix has also gotten in on the trend, ordering 20 episodes of Chuck Lorre\u2019s Disjointed, a comedy starring Kathy Bates as the owner of an LA-based cannabis dispensary, and Kevin Smith, a man who knows a thing or two about writing stoner characters, has filmed a spec pilot about a weed dispensary in LA. Even NBC has been considering a weed show, with Parks and Recreation star Adam Scott\u2019s Buds, a comedy set in a marijuana shop in Denver.</p> <p>These light-hearted comedies are a long way from the \u201cdrugs are bad, mkay?\u201d special episodes of 90s sitcoms. Not all drugs are getting the comedy treatment \u2013 heroin and meth are still the reserve of heavy-going dramas (It\u2019s Always Sunny in Philadelphia has a running joke about the characters being crack addicts, but it\u2019s just about the darkest sitcom on TV right now, so probably doesn\u2019t count) \u2013 but TV producers have clearly loosened up when it comes to cannabis. Perhaps it\u2019s down to changes in law and public opinion (a recent survey shows that <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.gallup.com/poll/150149/Record-High-Americans-Favor-Legalizing-Marijuana.aspx\">50% of Americans</a> support the legalization of recreational marijuana), or perhaps the \u201cslacker stoner\u201d character type was just so damn likable that it won us all over. Either way, for the next few years at least, the future\u2019s looking pretty darn green.</p>",
  "<p>The painting that greets you at the entrance to the National Portrait Gallery\u2019s autumn show is Picasso\u2019s famous <em>Self-portrait with Palette</em> from 1906. It\u2019s pre-cubist but post-blue period, so the young man\u2019s eyes, ears and nose are all pointing in the same direction and his hair isn\u2019t marine-coloured, but a proper Iberian lacquer black. There\u2019s a blank, mask-like quality to the face, yet Picasso is instantly recognisable in the broad fleshy nose and bull neck. At the same time the painting is a clear homage to an <a href=\"https://www.wikiart.org/en/paul-cezanne/self-portrait-with-palette\">earlier self-portrait by Cezanne</a> \u2013 there\u2019s the same austerity, the same workmanlike setting \u2013 as well as exhibiting a cousinship with Picasso\u2019s own triumphant <a href=\"http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/works-of-art/47.106/\">image of Gertrude Stein</a>, also from 1906 (that basilisk stare and sand-coloured skin). What\u2019s more, by choosing to pose with the paraphernalia of his profession, Picasso puts himself in a tradition of classic portraiture that stretches back centuries to his beloved <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/goya\">Goya</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/diego-velazquez\">Vel\u00e1zquez</a>.</p> <p>It\u2019s an awful lot for one picture to do, which is why it stands as gatekeeper to an exhibition that sets out to unsettle what we think we know about Picasso, about portraiture, and about Picasso and portraiture. That it is the NPG that is hosting the show adds a further layer of complexity. Set up in 1856 to provide a biography in paint of the men (and very occasional woman) who had made Britain great, the gallery historically had little interest in how portraits were done, or even whether they were done well. All that mattered was whose face was staring back at you from the wall. <em>Picasso Portraits</em>, by contrast, is all about the infinite ways in which the greatest artist of the 20th century tackled his most enduring subject, the human figure. Among the 75 pieces of art on display here, sourced from around the world, you will find dashed-off caricatures, carefully formulated cubes, calm neoclassicism and, during the first four years of the 20th century, an awful lot of blue.</p> <p>The young Picasso began his career with the long apprenticeship in the human form that every art student, whether in London, Rome, Paris or indeed Barcelona, was obliged to undergo. First came the endless drawing of canonical antique sculpture, then graduation to the life class. Typical too was the insistence of Picasso\u2019s art teacher father that his boy should master the knack of producing \u201clikenesses\u201d, briskly and to order. Portraiture was a steady, well\u2011paid gig (there were always people vain enough to want to see themselves in paint), and it got you an entrance into the best circles. At the very least, you\u2019d always be able to pay the rent.</p> <p>But these lapdog aspects of professional face-painting were anathema to Picasso. He never took on a commission and any notable people he painted during his long career \u2013 Stein, Stravinsky, Cocteau \u2013 were only there by chance, because they were friends or colleagues or had an interesting arrangement of flesh and bone that he itched to get down on paper. And rather than include a famous subject\u2019s name in a painting\u2019s title, Picasso often used the broadest descriptions, such as <a href=\"https://www.guggenheim.org/conservation/picassos-woman-ironing\"><em>Woman Ironing</em></a> or <em>Cubist Head</em>.</p> <p>Not every sitter was thrilled by these erasures. Dora Maar, Picasso\u2019s lover from the late 1930s, famously said of his pictures of her: \u201cthey\u2019re all Picassos, not one is Dora Maar\u201d. But the fact that she made the claim in the bitter years after their relationship ended is often overlooked, allowing the idea to flourish that Picasso was a monomaniac who absorbed other people\u2019s faces into his greedy art with little care for what made them unique. The fact that he often dismissed his sitters after a few hours, preferring to work from their photographs instead, only added to this suspicion that he was not a portraitist but a Picasso-ist, intent on remaking the world, and everyone in it, in his own image.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5d36fa6c371f7f98c718f015a3633b77a59ab1ab\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5d36fa6c371f7f98c718f015a3633b77a59ab1ab/0_0_2400_3281/731.jpg\" alt=\"Picasso Woman With Joined Hands\" width=\"731\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\"><em>Woman With Joined Hands</em></span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Private Collection</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This is unfair, says Elizabeth Cowling, the curator of <em>Picasso Portraits</em>. And to prove it she has grouped together three portraits of three different women painted within a few months of each other in 1938. In <a href=\"http://art.gg-art.com/showen.php?photo=92/abj6rmhl3.jpg\"><em>Woman With Joined Hands</em></a> Picasso presents his longtime lover Marie-Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Walter with soft, loving intimacy. Despite being rendered in graphic greys and blacks, Walter resembles nothing so much as a comfortably padded sofa, all folds and creases and cushiony cross-hatching. At the same time her body\u2019s sinuous contours suggest a surging eroticism, one that speaks of pleasurable sexual familiarity rather than piercing desire.</p> <p>Just a month later Picasso drew <a href=\"http://www.pablo-ruiz-picasso.net/theme-nuscheluard.php\">Nusch \u00c9luard</a>, the wife of his friend the surrealist poet Paul \u00c9luard. \u00c9luard, a professional acrobat with a light, pliable body, is conveyed in tight angles and wafer-thin planes, her wiry hair rendered in hard squiggles. There is none of the placid softness of Walter in evidence here, and \u00c9luard\u2019s outsized claw-hand is a pointed joke that acrobats, like cats, have nine lives.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b4e68753b7944da1e58d7c3ef55b668898d1e33a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b4e68753b7944da1e58d7c3ef55b668898d1e33a/0_0_2400_3230/743.jpg\" alt=\"Nush \u00c9luard\" width=\"743\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\"><em>Nush \u00c9luard </em>(1938)</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Succession Picasso/DACS London</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Completing the trio of female portraits from 1938 is <a href=\"http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/picasso-dora-maar-seated-t00341\"><em>Dora Maar Seated</em></a>.

This tortured frenzy matched what Picasso called Maar\u2019s \u201cKafkaesque\u201d personality. Beneath the hectic surface of ink and thinned-out gouache you can make out her tightly clamped-together legs (the couple rowed frequently) as well as references to her studied self-presentation as a Spanish <em>se\u00f1ora</em> straight out of Goya (she was actually French-Croatian). Despite what Maar liked to say, this could only be her.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"057cd631779503846d5b872548a693be7806d1ef\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/057cd631779503846d5b872548a693be7806d1ef/0_0_2400_3764/638.jpg\" alt=\"Picasso Dora Maar Seated (1938)\" width=\"638\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\"><em>Dora Maar Seated </em>(1938)</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Succession Picasso/DACS, London 2016 \u00a9Tate, London 2016</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Picasso\u2019s insistence on matching his style to the idiosyncrasies of each sitter has its roots, suggests Cowling, in the artist\u2019s lifelong practice of caricature. Starting as a schoolboy in the 1890s, he delighted in making swift, scabrous sketches of his friends on napkins, torn up bits of paper bag, in the margins of his textbooks. As an adolescent he drew doodles of his art school colleagues, and later it would be dealers, patrons, rivals and friends, whom he dashed down in a few bold strokes \u2013 here an elongated neck, there a ridiculous moustache or odd pair of glasses. These were in-jokes, a way of cementing bonds in a homosocial atmosphere that was also deeply competitive: so the artist Josep Rocarol i Faura is drawn, flushed and sloppy from too much absinthe, while the small and prudish Jaume Sabart\u00e9s is shown leering at nubile pin-ups ripped from magazines. The poet Guillaume Apollinaire is made into a fat businessman (he was actually a bank clerk) with a pear-shaped head. Far from being insulted by his friend\u2019s view of him, Apollinaire treasured Picasso\u2019s scrawls as tokens of affectionate attention.</p> <p>It has been customary to ignore this aspect of Picasso\u2019s work, to classify his caricatures as byproducts \u2013 waste products, even \u2013 of the finer kind of art with which he was concerned over six decades. But, suggests the exhibition, it was in these quick-fire sketches that he honed the ability to edit, distil and exaggerate details that allowed him to produce portraits that went far beyond mere surface likeness, and penetrated instead to the essence of each sitter. \u201cThere are so many realities that in trying to encompass them all one ends in darkness,\u201d Picasso once explained. \u201cThat is why, when one paints a portrait, one must stop somewhere, in a sort of caricature.\u201d Later, this too became pithily contracted to \u201call portraiture is caricature\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"13d7b54b0d934eb5265cd880d5b817289dc41c62\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/13d7b54b0d934eb5265cd880d5b817289dc41c62/0_0_2400_2977/806.jpg\" alt=\"Picasso Gustave Coquiot\" width=\"806\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\"><em>Gustave Coquiot </em>(1901).</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Centre Pompidou, Paris. Mus\u00e9e national d'art moderne   \u00a9 Succession Picasso/DACS, London 2016</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>You can see this principle at work in an early portrait of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/gallery/2009/feb/23/picasso-challenging-past-national-gallery#img-13\">Gustave Coquiot</a>, a louche Parisian critic about town. The portrait is a thank you present for a nice review that Coquiot had recently written of the young man\u2019s work, yet there is nothing remotely ingratiating about it. Coquiot is shown with a wet lascivious grin sheltering under a ludicrously twisty moustache while near-naked showgirls bump and grind in the background. Coquiot\u2019s hand, resting on his lap, looks as though it is positioned to conceal an incipient erection. But if this is smut, it is smut with a point to it: in setting and style Picasso knowingly channels Toulouse-Lautrec, the pre-eminent genre painter of Parisian fl\u00e2nerie, an art historical reference he knew would tickle Coquiot\u2019s vanity.</p> <p>Even when Picasso moved decisively away from descriptive naturalism, there is never any sense that he is slighting his human subjects. Instead, he sought always to find the details that made individuals instantly recognisable to themselves and to others. One of the jewels in the NPG exhibition is Picasso\u2019s 1910 portrait of art dealer <a href=\"http://www.artic.edu/aic/collections/artwork/111060\">Daniel-Henry Kahnweiler</a>, a cubist masterpiece that rarely leaves the Art Institute of Chicago. At first glance the picture seems to be merely a metre-high arrangement of grey and sludge-coloured squares. Gradually, though, the eye settles and the pattern resolves so that beneath the facets you begin to see the soft but certain form of a bourgeois man. There is his beaky nose, his wings of oiled wavy hair, his neatly folded hands, his watch chain.</p> <p>Far from being random, each of these details is part of a caricatural shorthand. Kahnweiler was famously punctual, which explains the watch chain. He was notoriously abstemious, hence the way that the wine glasses that so often figure in cubist paintings have been replaced on this occasion by medicine bottles. These in-jokes add up to an image that is designed to be instantly readable to those who knew Kahnweiler well, yet still speak to those who have never set eyes on the subject of Picasso\u2019s portrait.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"45802c77af398bd169b4a02b23dcd78fb76c1a37\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/45802c77af398bd169b4a02b23dcd78fb76c1a37/0_0_2000_2429/823.jpg\" alt=\"Picasso Woman in a Hat (Olga)\" width=\"823\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\"><em>Woman in a Hat (Olga)</em> (1935).</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Collection Centre Pompidou, Dist. RMN Grand Palais</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Nor did Picasso paint his people in an eternal present. He used his repertoire of gestures honed from years of doing caricatures not to generalise about a face, to fix it for all time, but to capture its quiddity. Some of the most expressive pieces in the exhibition are those of his many lovers during the dying days of their relationships. <em>Woman in a Hat (Olga)</em> (1935) shows his first wife\u2019s face segmented between sickly chalk white and venomous green. Her eyes are deep black holes, staring with fatigue and disappointment, while her mouth is a downward slit. The stiffly lacquered hair and purple hat, meanwhile, speak of a desperate need to put a good face on things going very wrong indeed. Its fractured desperation stands in extraordinary contrast to the luminous neoclassical portrait Picasso had completed of Olga 12 years earlier in which she is portrayed as entirely in charge of herself, as serene as a Roman matron.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"77b21efb03a9259b320f8d155789cfd10771086d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/77b21efb03a9259b320f8d155789cfd10771086d/0_0_2400_3691/650.jpg\" alt=\"Picasso Woman in a Hat (1941)\" width=\"650\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\"><em>Woman in a Hat</em> (1941)</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Succession Picasso/DACS, London 2016</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>And then there is another woman in another hat, this time from 1941. It is Dora Maar, painted at the moment when she and Picasso returned to Nazi-occupied Paris to discover horrors that they could not quite believe. Like Olga, Dora is trying to hold herself together, smart in a business-like suit. Her jaunty hat, however, is woefully small for a giant head that looks anxiously in two directions at once, alert to the sound of tramping boots or a knock on the door. Her body, rigid with fear, seems to have become fused to the chair on which she perches (even Picasso\u2019s most non-naturalistic portraits used the standard seated pose from classical tradition). And then there are the hands, clawed with tension, the nails painted a ripe red, suggesting that a fight to the death may already be going on in the streets below. Here, surely, is Picasso\u2019s definitive riposte to anyone who maintained, still maintains in fact, that his portraiture was indifferent to its subjects and careless about their circumstances. What he had actually done was take a moribund tradition, concerned with commemoration of the blandest kind, and wrench it back to thrilling life.</p> <p><em> \u2022 Picasso Portraits</em> is at the National Portrait Gallery, London WC2, from 6 October. <a href=\"http://www.npg.org.uk/whatson/picasso-portraits/exhibition.php\">npg.org.uk</a>.</p>",

  "<p>On a sunny November day nearly four years ago, as I flipped through a Pottery Barn catalog on our deck, my husband of 14 years revealed that he had been having an affair for the previous 10 months. His revelation was a punch in my gut, and as my mind simultaneously raced for comprehension and was struck numb, he dropped his next bombshell: his mistress was six months pregnant. In that moment, I was faced with my worst fear.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/mar/25/tell-us-about-a-time-you-faced-your-fear\">Tell us about a time you faced your fear</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Like many children of divorce, I grew up with one burning desire: to have a good marriage and a happy home. My parents divorced when I was three, and the custody battle that ensued traumatized my sisters and me. My mother was awarded custody and promptly moved us from Florida to New Hampshire, meaning my relationship with my father was regulated to Sunday night phone calls, summer vacations and every other Christmas.</p> <p>Life with my mother was chaotic, unstable and often depressing. She and my stepfather were always in crisis mode, and I longed for the calm stability I experienced at the homes of my friends whose parents were married. I vowed that my future children would have a perfect home where they felt safe and secure.</p> <p>By the time I married at the age of 34, I hadn\u2019t seen or spoken to my father in years. It\u2019s horrible to be a walking cliche, but that\u2019s what I was. I had daddy issues. I had a series of failed relationships behind me, and I was forever looking for the man who could fill the deep and excruciating void left by the father I once adored.<br></p> <p>Enter my husband. We fell in love in South Africa, and compared with my wild journalist friends, he was relatively boring. He was an accountant, the most responsible adult I had ever met. I had had more passionate affairs, but married him because I believed he would provide the safe, stable home for which I had always yearned.</p> <p>And he did, for a time. Our daughter was born a year after the wedding, and almost from the moment of her birth, I began to explain to him how important he would be in shaping her sense of self. More importantly, I stressed that he would provide the foundation for her future romantic relationships. I was determined that my daughter would understand what it meant to be loved by the first man in her life, her father. I implored him to never break up our family.</p> <p>So on that November day, as I blinked back tears, the first words I uttered were, \u201cWhat about the children? This is the one thing I asked you never to do\u201d. In the days and weeks that followed, I went through myriad emotions, and always at the forefront was the impact my husband\u2019s actions would have on our children (we had a son three years<strong> </strong>after our daughter). </p> <p>But as I faced the precise scenario I erroneously believed I had protected myself from, a surprising thing happened: I didn\u2019t crumble. Even my husband commented on my strength, remarking that he had expected me to fall apart.</p> <p>Faced with the unthinkable, I strove to control the one aspect that was paramount: my children\u2019s relationship with their father. They were hurt and angry and afraid. At times they wanted nothing to do with him.</p> <p>But I quietly and steadily beat my drum, encouraging them to express their feelings, but not to turn their backs on a relationship that would impact the rest of their lives. As a little girl, I revered my own father, but as I grew older, our relationship became strained. My children didn\u2019t have to grow up without a father even though our family was shattered.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/16/facing-my-fear-i-was-molested-as-a-child-would-my-own-kids-judge-me-for-it\">Facing my fear: I was molested as a child.

  "<p>Soon after the Carrier Corporation announced in February that it planned to close its 1,400-employee plant here and move operations to Mexico, Donald Trump lashed out at the company for betraying the US and its workers.<br></p> <p>On Monday, he was at it again. Only five minutes into his first debate with rival Hillary Clinton, Trump had cited Carrier as an example of the \u201cjobs fleeing this country\u201d. \u201cSo many hundreds and hundreds of companies are doing this,\u201d he said in his latest attempt to blame trade deals for the US\u2019s industrial decline.<br></p> <p>Carrier, whose founder, Willis Carrier, invented the modern air conditioner, has been in Indiana since the 1950s.

Some 572,000 people were employed in manufacturing jobs in the state in January 2006. That dropped to 425,000 in June 2009. Employment is now back to over 515,000, but the trend is declining. Carrier\u2019s parent company, United Technologies, is <a href=\"http://wane.com/2016/02/10/utec-leaving-huntington-for-mexico-at-cost-of-700-jobs/\">cutting 700 jobs</a> at another of its company\u2019s plants in the state and, again, moving the operation to Mexico.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2016/09/indiana-manufacturing/\" data-alt=\"Indiana lost many manufacturing jobs in the recession but has been recovering them\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2016/09/indiana-manufacturing/\">Indiana lost many manufacturing jobs in the recession but has been recovering them</a> <figcaption>Indiana lost many manufacturing jobs in the recession but has been recovering them</figcaption> </figure>  <p>When a top Carrier official, Chris Nelson, announced the closing in February, he said Carrier would not begin laying off workers until 2017 and would not entirely close the operation until 2019.</p> <p> Nelson said the company was moving the operation to Mexico to \u201cremain competitive and protect the business for the long term\u201d. \u201cRelocating our operations to Monterrey,\u201d he said, \u201cwill allow us to maintain high levels of quality, competitive prices and serve the extremely price-sensitive marketplace.\u201d</p> <p>Even with all this lead time before getting laid off, Staples, the father of two boys, 11 and seven years old, worries that he won\u2019t find a job that pays nearly as well as his current $24.03-an-hour Carrier job. \u201cI\u2019ve looked into several other manufacturing jobs \u2013 they all want to pay $13, $14, $15 an hour. That\u2019s about half what I make now,\u201d he said. Staples has been hoping to buy a new house in a neighborhood with better schools, but the pending layoff could sabotage that plan. </p> <p> Chuck Jones, president of the steelworkers local here, was enraged by Carrier\u2019s decision, noting that Carrier\u2019s parent company, United Technologies, had record profits of $7.6bn last year. \u201cIt\u2019s not that we produced a bad product or the company wasn\u2019t profitable,\u201d Jones said. \u201cIt\u2019s because they\u2019re greedy sons of bitches who want to make more money. They don\u2019t care a rat\u2019s ass about the 1,400 people they employ and don\u2019t care how their lives turn out.\u201d</p> <p> Jones said Local 1999\u2019s members weren\u2019t excited about the presidential candidates. \u201cSome people are going to support Trump because they want something different,\u201d he said. To many Carrier workers, Jones said, Trump\u2019s choice of Indiana\u2019s governor, Mike Pence, as his running mate was a strike against him. \u201cPence did nothing as governor to help the Carrier workers,\u201d Jones said. He noted that many workers further soured on Trump when his financial disclosure forms noted that he owned United Technologies stock.</p> <p> Inside Sully\u2019s, a popular bar across from the Carrier plant, David Parliament, a Carrier worker for three decades, said he favored Trump over Clinton because \u201che\u2019s not a politician, he\u2019s a businessman\u201d. He called Clinton \u201ca complete politician\u201d. Parliament added, however, that it was hardly worth voting because it\u2019s so clear that Indiana will go Republican this year. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f59b560fbdfe1e3d10c7bffdcba82a8e62e21374\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f59b560fbdfe1e3d10c7bffdcba82a8e62e21374/0_303_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Carrier workers are worried by Hillary Clinton\u2019s former support for trade agreements\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Carrier workers are worried by Hillary Clinton\u2019s former support for trade agreements including Nafta.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jim Young/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p> His drinking buddy, Conrad, a retired supervisor who declined to give his last name, enthusiastically backed Trump. \u201cI think he\u2019ll bring jobs back.

  "<p><strong>I was born in Chicago. It\u2019s an amazing city.</strong> It feels alive, it has an identity, and I feel connected here. I started playing blues professionally in 1974, with an old boogie-woogie piano player, Jimmy Walker. By the following year I was in the band of the great Willie Dixon, who wrote classics such as Hoochie Coochie Man, I Just Want to Make Love to You and Little Red Rooster. He was an important mentor for me. As a city, Chicago is probably unique for musicians in that you could just work within it and make a living playing blues.</p> <p><strong>Blues is on the tourist trail now, but that doesn\u2019t mean the money always trickles down to the musicians</strong>. For a taste of the old South Side, check out the Odyssey Lounge East at 99th Street and Torrence Avenue. It used to belong to the husband of the \u201cqueen of the blues\u201d, Koko Taylor. It has a jam session on Sundays with a house band, a group who play solid Chicago R&amp;B, including Sidney Joe Qualls, a great singer in the Al Green mould.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b876a5ad2436b53bc733b871a5395277b6c5a908\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b876a5ad2436b53bc733b871a5395277b6c5a908/0_0_4757_2854/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Blues musicians Eddie Shaw and Bob Stroger on stage at Rosa\u2019s Lounge, Chicago, Illinois, US.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Blues musicians Eddie Shaw and Bob Stroger on stage at Rosa\u2019s Lounge, Chicago</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Paul Natkin/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>On the road with Willie Dixon, it didn\u2019t matter how late it was</strong>, what you were up to, or who you were with, he\u2019d call up and tell you to come on over. You\u2019d have to drop everything and work with him on a song. He was always writing. He would keep time on his notebook with his pencil, like a snare drum.</p> <p><strong>There is so much music here \u2013 not just blues</strong>.<strong> </strong>There\u2019s jazz, classical, folk, country and ethnic, from Puerto Rican to Irish. There\u2019s a real sense of identity in the neighbourhoods, of belonging. It\u2019s not unusual for me to be playing and someone will come up and say, \u201cI knew your mother as a little girl,\u201d or, \u201cI went to school with your father.\u201d Everybody knows everybody.</p> <p><strong>Chicago has probably the most extensive parks of any major US city</strong>. If you go into the hood you\u2019re still going to find a nice, well-maintained park. Recently I played at the <a href=\"https://garfieldconservatory.org/\">Garfield Park Conservatory</a>, a magnificent place on the West Side, with botanical gardens and a giant greenhouse, trees, flowers and plants, and it\u2019s in the heart of the ghetto. The <a href=\"http://www.choosechicago.com/articles/view/the-lakefront-trail/454/\">Lakefront Trail</a> runs all the way from 71st Street in the South Side up to 5800 North Sheridan.

  "<h2>From Rosario to Atlanta: Tata Martino checks in</h2> <p>Earlier this week, Atlanta United FC, MLS\u2019s expansion team for 2017, made headlines as they introduced to the world their first ever manager. And what a pick it was: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/27/tata-martino-mls-atlanta-united\">53-year-old Gerardo Tata Martino arrives to America </a>as one of the most experienced coaches to have ever graced Major League Soccer. Aside from his run with the Argentinian national team (just three losses from 29 matches, including reaching the final of the 2015 Copa America and the 2016 Centenario) and a topsy-turvy season with Barcelona, Martino also helped Paraguay reach the quarter-finals of the 2010 World Cup in South Africa. A hard-fought 1-0 loss to eventual champions Spain ended Paraguay\u2019s most successful run in the tournament\u2019s history.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/sep/26/patrick-vieira-brought-a-vital-asset-to-new-york-city-fc-respect\">Patrick Vieira brought a vital asset to New York City FC: respect</a> </p> </aside>  <p>There are certain obstacles that Tata will face in America. For one, his English is extremely basic, but he\u2019s lucky: his wife, Maria Angelica, is an English teacher. Another issue will be the task of helping to develop the foundations of a brand new franchise, as well as learning the ropes in a new league, but in many ways, Tata is the perfect man for this job. When he managed Newell\u2019s Old Boys (one of his former clubs as a player) Martino\u2019s emphasis on youth development was a key factor for the team\u2019s success. When Martino took over the club, they were dangerously close to relegation to the second division, but Tata secured first-division status, which was then followed by winning the 2013 Torneo final (the second and final tournament of Argentina\u2019s first division) the following season and reaching the semifinal stages of Copa Libertadores.</p> <p>This was partly thanks to Martino\u2019s focus on the academy and what he could get out of them. This mentality is something he carries with him no matter where he is, and it\u2019s something he feels very strongly about. \u201cWorking with the youth teams is fundamental for me,\u201d he said during Wednesday\u2019s press conference. \u201cNo matter where in the world I\u2019m coaching.\u201d This will be no different with Atlanta: one of their main philosophies centers around the focus on young players and how to cultivate their talents and eventually feeding off the process \u2013 much like recent US Open Cup champions FC Dallas.</p> <p>In terms of style, Atlanta fans should expect a high-intensity, high-pressure system \u2013 much like Tottenham\u2019s Mauricio Pochettino, both of course, disciples of Marcelo Bielsa. Bielsa\u2019s relationship with Martino goes back to the aforementioned Old Boys when Tata was <em>El Loco</em>\u2019s favorite player on the pitch in the early 90\u2019s. Aside from the pressing game, Martino deeply understands the possession mentality, thanks to his tiki-taka days with Barcelona, but make no mistake, the team will look to suffocate opponents in their own half right from the kick-off.</p> <p>Whether the man from Rosario succeeds or not is a question yet to be answered, but one thing is for certain: Atlanta United not only have a manager with tremendous pedigree, but one of the smartest tacticians in world soccer who can turn this brand new team \u2013 from the academy to the senior players \u2013 into true disciples of his philosophy. <strong>LME</strong></p> <h2>New York Red Bulls look for victory after success in Concacaf</h2> <p>On Tuesday evening, the New York Red Bulls made franchise history as they advanced to the knockout stages of the Concacaf Champions League by managing a 0-0 result with current Guatemalan league champions Antigua GFC. \u201cIt\u2019s a big moment for our club, a big moment for our team, and I\u2019m really proud of our guys,\u201d <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.newyorkredbulls.com/post/2016/09/27/match-recap-red-bulls-0-antigua-gfc-0\">said head coach Jesse Marsch after the match.</a> \u201cI think they showed a lot of character and proved what we\u2019ve been all about.\u201d</p> <p>One can only think Marsch is referring to the team\u2019s resilience and all-or-nothing attitude towards competition \u2013 or as they call it in Uruguay, <em>la garra charrua</em>: when a player leaves the field with nothing else to give. It\u2019s this characteristic that has propelled the red side of New York on becoming a strong team, physically and mentally, and Tuesday night\u2019s performance proved it as they had to endure some tough conditions. Due to the heavy rain prior to kick-off, the Estadio Mateo Flores was waterlogged and chances came few and far between. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t going to be about soccer; it was going to be about winning battles and loose balls and 50-50s,\u201d said Marsh. \u201cWe were 14-for-14 in terms of guys who were fighting out there, clawing for every inch and doing everything that they could to make sure we would get the result.\u201d</p> <p>Given the nature of the performance and the fact that their win against Montreal last weekend was no walk in the park, the team will need to keep this level of intensity as they look to win the Eastern Conference title with only three matches to go. Philadelphia Union who also have a mathematical \u2013 albeit improbable \u2013 possibility of winning the conference and could not care less about New York\u2019s mentality. Philly are one win away from matching their club record for wins in a season with 12 victories, but, more importantly, the ability to stay in the top four would mean home advantage, even if it was just for one game. This would matter to the Union as they have an 8-4-3 record at Talen Energy Stadium. A victory \u2013 alongside a New England Revolution loss or draw to Sporting Kansas City \u2013 would also guarantee a playoff spot. <strong tabindex=\"-1\">LME</strong></p> <h2>Toronto FC missing Giovinco for visit of DC United</h2> <p>DC United\u2019s 3-0 midweek win against Columbus made it two wins in a row for the first time this year \u2013 and it was another critical victory as they cling on to the last playoff spot in the East. The good news is that they control their own fate and if they can keep winning, postseason will be a reality. \u201cDoing math at this point is silly,\u201d head coach Ben Olsen said prior to Wednesday\u2019s match. \u201cWe are going to get as many points each weekend as we can.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fe09450905fb55cc64354d9751964ecf1a6209d2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fe09450905fb55cc64354d9751964ecf1a6209d2/0_0_1484_990/1000.jpg\" alt=\"DC United forward Alvaro Saborio (9) celebrates with Lamar Neagle (13).\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">DC United forward Alvaro Saborio (9) celebrates with Lamar Neagle (13).</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Geoff Burke/USA Today Sports</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The bad news, however, is that their next opponent are conference leaders Toronto FC, who \u2013 without their creative juggernaut Sebastian Giovinco because of a quad injury \u2013 tied 0-0 against Orlando City on Wednesday night, and will be looking for goals in front of their home crowd. Despite the fact that they have already qualified and lead the conference, head coach Greg Vanney knows that three straight draws at home is not good enough, so he\u2019ll be looking to make a few changes against United. He\u2019ll have to do without Canadian international Tosaint Ricketts, who was sent off with 20 minutes left in the game. Ricketts received a second yellow card after a missed bicycle-kick hit Uruguayan defender Jose Aja, who clutched his face in agony after the collision.</p> <p>Replay, however, showed that Ricketts actually didn\u2019t hit Aja and the midfielder was perhaps slightly unfortunate. \u201cIt is what it is. It\u2019s done now,\u201d said Ricketts after the game. \u201cIt\u2019s unfortunate. But I guess we\u2019ll just see what happens from here.\u201d What happens is a one-game suspension for Saturday evening against a team desperate for three points. <strong>LME</strong><br></p> <h2>Three games to go, and the Portland Timbers are sweating</h2> <p>Could the MLS Cup holders miss out on a playoff spot? There are worried looks in Portland at the moment: a sequence of bum of results have meant the Timbers have slipped to seventh in the Western Conference, the wrong side of the red line at the wrong moment in the season.</p> <p>Vancouver and San Jose are surely out of it now \u2013 the gap just looks too large to breach with just three games remaining. But Portland, who just last week looked odds-on for a postseason slot, experienced the worst possible combination of results. Their sorry 3-1 defeat at bottom club Houston was combined with a Sporting KC win in San Jose, and then the Timbers had to watch as a Jordan Morris-inspired Seattle rampaged to victory at LA Galaxy on Sunday. Seattle followed that up with victory on Wednesday, and now the Cascadia pair are level on 41 points. But Seattle\u2019s goal difference is better by two \u2013 and they have one game in hand. Portland are sweating.</p> <p>The problem for the Timbers is that two of their remaining games come away from Providence Park, and their away form has been wretched since the start of the year: their 2-1 victory over CD Dragon of El Salvador in the Concacaf Champions League on Wednesday night was their first victory on the road all season.</p> <p>\u201cThis is a big win,\u201d Timbers head coach Caleb Porter said after the 2-1 victory in Central America. \u201cNot just to give ourselves a chance in the Concacaf Champions League in that last game, but I think that we can use this to build on for the rest of the year.\u201d</p> <p>Porter acknowledged the disruption to his team this year, but but their run-in is about as difficult as it gets: Colorado away, then Colorado at home, and a trip to Vancouver to finish. Can they get two wins from three? Porter said he was proud regardless. \u201cWe have had a rough year. We have dealt with a bunch of injuries and managed adversity like I have never seen, but these guys just keep fighting. I am very proud of them.\u201d</p> <p>Colorado still have an outside chance of the Supporters\u2019 Shield trophy, but it seems unlikely, even though they have two games in hand on Dallas. Last week the Rapids played out a high-scoring draw with Vancouver \u2013 extremely uncharacteristic for a side that keeps goals out but also fails to score them, with just 32 in 29 games.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing wrong in the back,\u201d insisted coach Pablo Mastroeni this week. \u201cWe\u2019ve proven it over the course of the season that there\u2019s nothing wrong in the back.\u201d Can they get it right at the other end? <strong>TH</strong></p> <h2>Surging Seattle aim for Cascadia Cup victory in Canada </h2> <p>For the first time this year, the Seattle Sounders sit the right side of the red line. About time! Wednesday night\u2019s 1-0 victory over Chicago Fire, thanks to Chad Marshall\u2019s first-half goal, took them into sixth, and came just four days after a potentially season-defining 4-2 win in Los Angeles. The Sounders\u2019 second-half display on Sunday was really something, and the way Jordan Morris ran away from Daniel Steres to make it 2-1 truly thrilled the senses. \u201cJordan\u2019s performance was big-time,\u201d admitted coach Brian Schmetzer afterwards.</p> <p>But the games keep coming thick and fast, and the Sounders face a difficult Cascadia Cup trip north on Sunday. Nicolas Lodeiro will be missing after picking up a dumb booking against Chicago, though, and that severely hinders Seattle\u2019s chances of victory. The Uruguayan\u2019s arrival from Boca Juniors has coincided with Seattle\u2019s upturn in form \u2013 three goals and eight assists earned him the MLS player of the month award for August, and meant Clint Dempsey\u2019s absence has been less keenly felt.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0c9ae4acdf2afc8e829147e3b52e941fd5f42e81\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0c9ae4acdf2afc8e829147e3b52e941fd5f42e81/0_109_4476_2959/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Seattle Sounders\u2019 Jordan Morris in action against the Chicago Fire.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"661\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Seattle Sounders\u2019 Jordan Morris in action against the Chicago Fire.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dean Rutz/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Schmetzer, who must also take enormous credit for his team\u2019s improvement, wasn\u2019t fazed by the loss of Lodeiro, though. \u201cWe lost Dempsey and what has this team done? They\u2019ve just continued,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ll definitely make preparations, it\u2019s a big loss, but we\u2019re going to go up to Vancouver trying to win.\u201d</p> <p>Carl Robinson saw his Vancouver team beat Central FC on Wednesday to qualify for the Concacaf Champions League quarter-finals with a 100% record, but he seemed to acknowledge after the game that a playoff spot was beyond them. \u201cPart of me reviewing the season was analyzing what was good at the start of the year and what wasn\u2019t,\u201d Robinson said. \u201cThere are a few areas that I\u2019ve identified that need to be a lot better. We got off to a slow start. Players weren\u2019t up to speed. I\u2019ll take responsibility for that even though they will have to as well. But next year that will not happen.\u201d</p> <p>A deep run in the CCL would at least salvage something from a disappointing campaign, and, as a top three seed, Vancouver ought to avoid the tournament\u2019s top sides until the semi-finals. \u201cIt\u2019s the first time we\u2019ve managed to do it in our history, so we\u2019re delighted,\u201d Robinson said, domestic disappointment notwithstanding. \u201cWe\u2019ll be very, very well prepared for whoever we face in the next round.\u201d <strong>TH</strong></p>",

In future, city authorities said, if you weren\u2019t Canadian, you would have to pay an extra 15% on the purchase price.</p> <p>The impact has, by some measures, been more startling than campaigners could have hoped for. The price of the average detached home <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/2016/09/02/vancouver-detached-home-price-crash-housing_n_11837936.html\">reportedly slumped</a> by an astonishing 16.7% in August alone to C$1.47m (\u00a3856,000), according to the Real Estate Board of Greater Vancouver.

Greater Vancouver\u2019s Real Estate Board prefers to use measures that suggest the city\u2019s market has only dipped mildly.</p> <p>And earlier this month Jing Li, a 29-year-old Chinese student living in the adjoining city of Burnaby, <a href=\"http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/class-action-lawsuit-launched-against-b-c-foreign-buyers-property-tax-1.3769751\">began a class-action lawsuit</a> against the new tax. Li had put a 10% deposit down on a half-million dollar Vancouver townhouse in July, only for the tax to be imposed 12 days later.</p> <p>According to CBC News, this added C$84,000 to the price of Li\u2019s house, meaning she was suddenly at risk of losing her C$56,000 deposit. \u201cI can\u2019t go forward and I can\u2019t go back,\u201d she told CBC. </p> <h2>\u2018The only solution\u2019</h2> <p>Ron Jordens, a 72-year-old retired engineer, lives in a rent-controlled apartment block in Mount Pleasant: once a gritty working-class Vancouver neighbourhood, now hipster central.</p> <p>The block\u2019s landlords have served an eviction notice. According to Jordens, they are hoping to cash in on the boom by renovating the flats \u2013 and raising rents by 50%.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.metronews.ca/news/vancouver/2016/09/12/tenants-question-bc-rent-laws.html\">He says the \u201crenovation\u201d is unnecessary</a>, claiming it is simply a device to circumvent rules protecting tenants. But amid spiralling rents elsewhere in the city, he says some of his neighbours have had no choice but to accept the landlords\u2019 demands. One single mother with an 11-year-old child was temporarily evicted, he says, and has had to take on three jobs to afford the new rent.</p> <p>\u201cPeople who have a good, decent-paying job can\u2019t afford to buy in Vancouver, and they can barely afford to rent,\u201d Jordens says.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5363f7216714b1d3300d442a8bcb9251f6f2271d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5363f7216714b1d3300d442a8bcb9251f6f2271d/0_102_2000_1200/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ron Jordens is facing eviction from his rent-controlled apartment block in Mount Pleasant.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\"><a href=\"http://www.metronews.ca/news/vancouver/2016/09/12/tenants-question-bc-rent-laws.html\">Ron Jordens is facing eviction</a> from his rent-controlled apartment block in Mount Pleasant.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jennifer Gauthier/Metro</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The new tax, he adds, is just \u201cputting a Band-Aid\u201d on the problem, predicting that \u201cthere will be ways around it with side-contracts. It has got to the point where the only solution has to be a \u2018no foreign ownership\u2019 deal on the table.\u201d<br></p> <p>But isn\u2019t Canada a country built on immigration? Jordens points to the thousands of unoccupied flats across the city, built for investors who often never reside there. \u201cIf you are coming to live here, get a job and pay taxes, that\u2019s great. The trouble is they don\u2019t live here, and they don\u2019t pay taxes.\u201d</p> <p>There are an estimated 10,000-plus empty apartments in Vancouver, of which a significant number are owned by foreign investors.

Even owners of empty Airbnb flats could be fined $10,000 for failing to comply. Vancouver is fast turning into a test-bed of initiatives to cool outrageous property prices and rents.</p> <p>But over on West Vancouver\u2019s Marine Drive, home to plush waterfront estates (one sold for $50m last year), the city\u2019s biggest realtor to Chinese investors, Clarence Debelle, says the new taxes are \u201cdriven by jealousy and envy\u201d.</p> <p>He says the Vancouver market was slowing in any case, and that the 15% tax on overseas buyers will do nothing to help priced-out 25- to 35-year-olds buying entry-level apartments. But it could, he warns, destroy the local economy. </p> <p>\u201cVirtually everything being built in West Vancouver is being built for a Chinese buyer. Vancouver has no industry apart from tourism and construction. So what do we do? Decide to insult the Chinese. You may not just blight the property market, but bankrupt the construction industry, too.\u201d </p> <p>Debelle predicts stalemate in Vancouver\u2019s market as sellers refuse to drop prices. And he fears for Canada\u2019s global reputation: \u201cIn my view, the Chinese see this as a racist-motivated tax. It\u2019s a dark moment in Canadian political history.<br></p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s the wrong tax too,\u201d he adds, \u201cas it won\u2019t help the people at the bottom wanting to get into the market. It has not changed the pricing of their homes one bit. There are better ways to help, such as increasing supply.\u201d</p> <p>Debelle\u2019s own father emigrated from Europe after the second world war. \u201cVancouver is now an international destination. You can\u2019t have it both ways: benefit from trade and tourism, <em>and</em> have the tax.\u201d </p> <h2>\u2018The market has been distorted\u2019<br></h2> <p>Vancouver\u2019s experiment is being closely watched in London. According to London Assembly member <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/sianberry\">Sian Berry</a>, who stood as the Green party\u2019s candidate for mayor: \u201cVancouver shows that the very rich buying up luxury flats at the expense of ordinary people is not just a London problem \u2013 it\u2019s a growing problem all over the world. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Vancouver shows that the rich buying up luxury flats at the expense of ordinary people is a growing problem worldwide</p> <footer> <cite>Sian Berry</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cLondon needs more devolution so we can take similar steps,\u201d Berry says, \u201ccontrolling stamp duty and council tax, and closing the loopholes that allow people to buy property through offshore companies \u2013 so that the people who actually live in London can stand a chance.</p> <p> \u201cA huge amount of housing in London is being bought up by offshore companies to avoid paying tax,\u201d she adds. \u201cIn my area in north London, overseas companies bought up \u00a32.5bn of property in just four years and avoided hundreds of millions in stamp duty.\u201d</p> <p>Berry\u2019s concerns are shared not only by the left. The Bow Group, a conservative thinktank, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/blog/2015/nov/21/foreign-buyers-british-property\">issued a paper last year</a> in which it talked of a global super-rich elite, some of them criminal, snapping up property in London, pushing up costs for existing residents and throwing the poor to the edges of the city. </p> <p>The report\u2019s author, Daniel Valentine, traces the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2016/sep/24/the-bubble-that-turned-into-a-tide-how-london-got-hooked-on-gentrification\">phenomenal increase in London house prices</a> to the mid 1990s, when three factors came together: a sudden surge in population, the explosion in buy-to-let lending, and the entry of China and Russia into the global economy, producing a global elite seeking a safe home for their cash.</p> <p>These factors have, he says, corrupted the market, creating an insatiable \u201cinvestment demand\u201d divorced from the underlying needs of British society.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"27041d975afe488d8c15479ab29412945488c4ff\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/27041d975afe488d8c15479ab29412945488c4ff/0_267_4000_2400/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Prospective buyers wait to inspect a house for sale in Sydney\u2019s Eastwood suburb.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Prospective buyers wait to inspect a house for sale in Sydney\u2019s Eastwood suburb.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bloomberg via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>On the other side of the Pacific to Vancouver, the same arguments are rehearsed in Australia and New Zealand, although not just about the global elite. One <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3752283/Young-Chinese-buyers-dominating-Sydney-property-market.html\">recent report </a>followed a day of family home auctions in Sydney\u2019s northern suburbs; all but one property were said to have been bought by Chinese buyers, with even modest homes fetching A$1.8m (\u00a31.05m). <br></p> <p>Two decades ago, buying a house in a major Australian city cost around five times the income of the average young Australian. Now, after the country\u2019s economic boom, it is about 15 times.</p> <p>Pete Wargent is a leading property buying agent in Sydney and Brisbane. \u201cThe phenomenon of the Chinese buyer has been a huge story here for years now. But you just have to look where Australia is; there are a lot of pathways for Chinese money.\u201d</p> <p>He says the flood of Chinese cash has sparked an <a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com.au/strength-or-a-sign-of-weakness-to-come-this-index-of-cranes-across-australian-capital-cities-is-up-20-2016-4\">extraordinary building boom</a>. \u201cThere are more high-rise apartments under construction than ever \u2013 with 150,000 going up across the country.\u201d </p> <p>Given that Australia bans foreign buyers of existing homes, nearly all the Chinese money is pouring into new-build towers. The 4% stamp duty surcharge means a non-resident buyer pays about A$30,000 more than an Australian resident for a A$750,000 apartment in Sydney.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2016/sep/29/gentrification-global-problem-better-solution-oliver-wainwright\">Gentrification is a global problem.

From 2017 a second new surcharge will hit non-residents: a 0.75% land tax, which has to be paid each year. Some fear that apartments bought off-plan will be dumped back on the market en masse.</p> <p>Will that help to moderate prices for local buyers? \u201cEventually it could help,\u201d says Wargent. \u201cThe problem in Sydney and Melbourne is that the market has been heavily distorted in favour of investors. In Sydney more than half the market is investors, which is a crazy imbalance.\u201d.</p> <p>Critics say that a flood of apartment purchases through domestic pension \u201csuper-funds\u201d is more to blame for the spiralling prices than Chinese buyers. Wargent also throws into the mix \u201clandbanking\u201d by major developers \u2013 drip-feeding sites into the market to ensure prices keep soaring \u2013 plus loose lending criteria from the major banks.</p> <p>\u201cIn truth, it has been tough for first-time buyers for nearly a generation now,\u201d he says. He advocates a broad-based land value tax (LVT) as about the only measure \u201cto cool the sheer demand for housing here\u201d.</p> <p>The bad news for young Australians wanting a foothold on the fabled property ladder is that the latest house price figures are <a href=\"http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-09-28/sydney-housing-market-fourth-on-global-bubble-index/7883816\">just out</a>.

Choose Swansea and you see <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/jan/23/francesco-guidolin-swansea-city-everton-experience-pedigree\">Francesco Guidolin</a> gesticulating on the touchline. And cut-scenes, featuring an array of hangers-on such as agents and endorsement reps, offer a tantalising glimpse into the life of a fledgeling superstar. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2015/aug/10/west-ham-reece-oxford-schoolboy-arsenal\">Reece Oxford</a> was involved as a consultant \u2013 and you sense that much of what\u2019s presented as fiction is reality for the West Ham youngster.</p> <p>That <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/gamesblog/2012/mar/06/mass-effect-3-game-review\">Mass Effect</a> reference wasn\u2019t a typo. Developer EA Canada worked with Bioware on the mode\u2019s dialogue options, which give you Commander Shepard-style choices at various points such as post-match interviews and scenes out on loan. (Vermire Athletic, sadly, aren\u2019t an option \u2013 only Norwich, Newcastle and Villa.) The media, your first-team coach and those hangers-on can all be conversed with in this way, albeit in a fairly linear manner; while most of the speech is of better quality than Match of the Day\u2019s \u201call credit to the lads on the pitch\u201d fare, your responses have little tangible effect. Come across as too fiery and you might be dropped for a game or two, but a strong training performance usually catapults you back into the starting XI.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ffa417cf06f0b0b4a28ec713249883c0b8cb1d63\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ffa417cf06f0b0b4a28ec713249883c0b8cb1d63/61_0_1200_720/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Journey mode gives players control of a fledgling Premier League player as he tackles opponents, agents and other dilemmas\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Journey mode gives players control of a fledgling Premier League player as he tackles opponents, agents and other dilemmas.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Electronic Arts</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Regardless of linearity, it\u2019s a lot of fun. A likeable cast \u2013 ex-pro grandfather, single mother, belittling team-mates turned friends \u2013 keep you invested throughout the season, and story landmarks, such as an Adidas boot deal for hitting 200,000 Twitter followers, pull you towards its climax. Without spoiling it, there\u2019s also a neat, user-specific reward for completion. EA has positioned The Journey as an experience never before offered in football games, and correctly so; it\u2019s one that football fans both casual and committed should find satisfying and unexpectedly insightful.</p> <p>If The Journey has been EA\u2019s off-pitch focus, on the field of play it\u2019s the Frostbite engine that the publisher has trumpeted loudest. Surprisingly, however, incorporating the tech which underpins Battlefield and Star Wars Battlefront only changes Fifa from a visual standpoint \u2013 although the cosmetic surgery is welcome. The new volumetric lighting is staggeringly realistic, with the feel of both summer evening kick-offs at Old Trafford and cliched wet Wednesdays in the red-and-white corner of Staffordshire recreated perfectly. Some 15 of the 20 Premier League bosses have been scanned and included here, the accurately modelled manager faces seemingly transferred straight from Uncanny Valley United. They are terrifying.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/video/2016/sep/30/fifa-17-animations-and-celebrations-cut-from-the-final-edit-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/5539m\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2758072\"            data-video-name=\"Fifa 17: animations and celebrations cut from the final edit \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"guardian.co.uk\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-57ebe157e4b01b56deffc4ad\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/09/29/160930Fifa17WengerKloppUPDATE_KP-29422157_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/09/29/160930Fifa17WengerKloppUPDATE_KP-29422157_V5.webm\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/09/29/160930Fifa17WengerKloppUPDATE_KP-29422157.m3u8\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/video/2016/sep/30/fifa-17-animations-and-celebrations-cut-from-the-final-edit-video\">Fifa 17: animations and celebrations cut from the final edit</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>The feel of the football isn\u2019t identical to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/sep/22/fifa-16-review-women-football-ea\">Fifa 16</a>, but nor is it transformative in the same way as PES 2017. On a fundamental level, passing, shooting and dribbling feel incredibly familiar; but, as with all sports games, extended play reveals fresh, exciting nuances. The random first touches which dogged last year\u2019s edition are gone; now everything is contextual, although attribute based. Most Premier League players trap the ball without problem if unmarked or unpressurised, but can be harried into mistakes, which is as it should be. Similarly, tackling feels much less like guesswork: go in for a slide and, if timed correctly, your player not only wins the ball, but looks to protect as he regains his feet, sparking the type of instant counter attack that wasn\u2019t possible a year ago.</p> <p>Additional physicality is the biggest, and best, change. There\u2019s close to zero ghosting through the back of opponents in order to steal possession, which is particularly key where old-fashioned centre-forward play is concerned. Attackers with impressive strength stats, such as Diego Costa and Olivier Giroud, shield the ball relentlessly \u2013 they\u2019re now a major asset to have on your team, and a headache to compete against. A deliberate knock-on effect is that they\u2019re also a huge threat where Fifa 17\u2019s retooled set-pieces are concerned; an aiming reticule on corners and free-kicks enables you to specify exactly where you want your cross to go \u2013 again with contextual results. Thankfully, this feature can be switched off should you get fed up with a friend arrowing every whipped ball towards Costa\u2019s frowning forehead.</p> <p>Some flaws return. Where <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/sep/19/pro-evolution-soccer-2017-review-konami-football-fifa\">Pro Evo </a>facilitates contemplative play, particularly in central midfield, Fifa still feels geared towards working the ball upfield as quickly as possible, prioritising fast wingers and mazy dribbles. More annoyingly, play on any difficulty above World Class (four stars, in old school parlance) and it can often be impossible to regain possession once your AI opponent takes the lead. In real life, that advantage turns most winning sides nervous in the dying embers of a match. In Fifa, it too often gives every opponent magnetised insteps.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9d998ff3e96433a6c987cca45f3d2fb9c7ae699d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9d998ff3e96433a6c987cca45f3d2fb9c7ae699d/121_0_1799_1080/1000.jpg\" alt=\"For those who love an accurately modelled stadium, Fifa 17 is the place to be, accurately replicated all the Premier League grounds\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">For those who love an accurately modelled stadium, Fifa 17 is the place to be, with replicated versions of all the Premier League grounds</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Electronic Arts</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Variety is also a small issue. Play a Master League campaign in PES as an English second-tier side and you\u2019ll compete against an assortment of strategies and tactics, depending on your opposition: triangular passing, long balls at physical forwards, and all things in between. In Fifa 17\u2019s career mode, at the same Championship standard, every AI competitor attempts the same possession-focussed ground game. New features such as board objectives keep the mode interesting, but long play sessions can feel laborious with little to differentiate the play styles of Chelsea, Cardiff and/or Cheltenham Town.</p> <p>Yet there are reasons to choose this over its resurgent rival. Limit yourself to exhibition matches alone and PES plays the (marginally) better game of football \u2013 but no one does that. Fifa\u2019s card-collecting Ultimate Team, where you assemble a dream roster by amassing Panini-style cards, remains unsurpassed by any contemporary, and its package is bolstered by features such as online seasons, Pro Clubs, and 50 real tournaments. And while it seems pass\u00e9 to mention licences, Fifa again dwarfs its rival where real kits, faces, stadia and presentation are concerned. Although some of these elements can be tackled in PES with a quick file download, this factor remains a deal-breaker for many fans, cementing Fifa 17\u2019s status as the complete footballing package. The Journey, really, is just the beginning of what is on offer here.</p> <p><strong>Electronic Arts; PS4 (version tested)/PS3/Xbox One/Xbox 360/PC; \u00a340; Pegi rating 3+</strong></p> <ul> <li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/sep/19/pro-evolution-soccer-2017-review-konami-football-fifa\"><strong>Pro Evolution Soccer 2017 review: the plucky underdog does it again</strong></a></li> </ul>",
  "<p>This month, marine conservation NGO Oceana released a <a href=\"http://usa.oceana.org/publications/reports/deceptive-dishes-seafood-swaps-found-worldwide?_ga=1.60306413.1738658057.1471597147\">major report</a> on <a href=\"http://oceana.org/our-campaigns/seafood_fraud/campaign\">seafood fraud</a>, which reviewed more than 200 scientific studies that had collectively examined over 25,000 fish samples from around the world. Through its analysis, Oceana was able to show that an astonishing one in five seafood samples globally is mislabelled to represent other species and mislead consumers. Nestled within that report was the case of the Amazon river dolphins \u2013 a peculiar testimony to the often bizarre, trickle-down effects of seafood fraud.</p> <p>These freshwater dolphins occupy the Amazon and Orinoco river basins that stretch across the northern half of South America. They have historically been abundant across this vast watery network, and are protected by law, making it illegal to kill them. But for years, poachers have been targeting the dolphins and using them as bait to catch a much smaller type of catfish.</p> <p>Two species \u2013 the tucuxi and boto dolphins, the latter also recognisable as the charismatic \u2018pink river dolphin\u2019 \u2013 are at the centre of this trade. But what\u2019s truly peculiar about this situation isn\u2019t just the strange juxtaposition of dolphins being exploited to feed much smaller fish: it\u2019s the identity of the fish they\u2019re being killed to catch in the first place. </p> <p>In South America, Hayd\u00e9e Cunha, a conservation geneticist at the Rio de Janeiro State University, has been investigating this problem ever since a mystery fish first started appearing in Brazilian grocery stores and street markets in 2008. In 2015 when she was at the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro, she produced a <a href=\"http://jhered.oxfordjournals.org/content/106/S1/565.full.pdf\">research paper</a> on seafood fraud that was featured in the Oceana report: it detailed the findings of a survey carried out in Manaus, the capital of Brazil\u2019s Amazonas state, which showed that a series of fictitious species names \u2013 \u2018douradinha\u2019, \u2018douradinho\u2019, and \u2018piratinga\u2019 \u2013 were all being used to describe the same type of fish. Using DNA tissue analysis, Cunha identified this species as a common catfish, known as <em>C. macropterus</em>.</p> <p>\u201cWe found that 60% of fillets being sold as \u2018douradinha\u2019, \u2018douradinho\u2019 and \u2018piratinga\u2019 were actually <em>C. macropterus</em>,\u201d Cunha says. The fraudulent names were deemed necessary to cover up the catfish\u2019s true identity, she explains, because it is a scavenger fish that would repel buyers if they knew. \u201cBrazilians find this catfish disgusting, because they know that it is necrophagous [carrion-feeding]. They refer to it as \u2018water vulture\u2019,\u201d she says. </p> <p>The original driver for this fraudulent trade was the overfishing of another, much preferred catfish species, the \u2018capaz\u2019, a regional delicacy that fetched a high price from consumers before its population began to dwindle. To replace the diminishing supply, fishers have since turned to <em>C. macropterus</em>, also known as \u2018mota\u2019. Because this particular species is drawn to carrion, large river dolphin carcasses \u2013 especially the larger pink boto dolphin \u2013 provide the ideal bait for attracting large numbers of these fish. </p> <p>Boto and tucuxi dolphins aren\u2019t currently listed as endangered; the International Union for Conservation of Nature describes their cases as \u2018data-deficient\u2019, meaning it can\u2019t make a definitive estimate about how threatened they are. But there\u2019s evidence of an increasingly sophisticated industry that\u2019s sprung up around these creatures. \u201cThere are reports of dolphin hunters that supply the fishermen, and also of freezing plant owners that keep dolphin carcasses to supply fishermen,\u201d Cunha says. </p> <p>The trade has undoubtedly also grown over the years. Vera da Silva, an aquatic mammal researcher with the National Institute of Amazonian Research, who has been <a href=\"http://www.avvx62.dsl.pipex.com/boto/about.htm\">surveying</a> boto dolphin populations for over 20 years, says that over the last decade its population has declined by 60% in one part of the Central Amazon. \u201cThe curve went down dramatically after 2000,\u201d she notes \u2013 around the same time fishermen started to target the scavenging catfish.</p> <p>Last year, a moratorium on fishing the <em>C. macropterus </em>catfish came into force, largely motivated by potential health impacts on humans, because the scavenging fish are also exposed to high levels of mercury. But despite the ban it\u2019s suspected that the trade continues: enforcement is weak, Da Silva says, and in her research Cunha notes that it\u2019s easy enough to invent new names for the species to hide its true identity.</p> <p>Now Cunha and Da Silva are working together to use DNA analysis to identify signs of seafood fraud and track its spread. \u201cWe need to check markets regularly in search of new disguises \u2013new fictitious names \u2013 for <em>C. macropterus, </em>and to use DNA to identify fillets,\u201d Cunha says. She and her team are also currently developing a rapid diagnostic test that will be used to identify the stomach contents of mystery fish for traces of dolphin or caiman DNA (these reptiles are less favoured, but also targeted by fishers as bait.) This could help environmental officials pinpoint hotspots of illegal activity. </p> <p>This month, Da Silva and other researchers will begin a new survey to monitor the densities of dolphins in parts of the Amazon. But from her point of view, the fishing moratorium, which will end in 2018, is too short. \u201cFive years is not enough for the recovery for any kind of mammal,\u201d she says; the boto breeds in three-year cycles, so population surveys won\u2019t be able to provide a full picture of the how well or poorly the dolphins have fared in this time. But, she adds, \u201cNo matter how much [fishermen] are killing now, they are killing less than they were before the moratorium. So we need to show that it\u2019s important to continue it for a longer period to allow the population to recover.\u201d</p> <p>Whatever the dolphins\u2019 fate, their case reveals that far from simple name switching, seafood fraud is a front for a backlog of crimes being perpetrated against aquatic and marine life. How many other fraudulent species names might hide stories just like this one?</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 3 October 2016. An earlier version misspelled the name of one of the freshwater dolphin species as tucixi. The correct spelling is tucuxi. </p>",

  "<p>For a few weeks in late summer, 20 years ago this year, English football had a new goalscoring hero. Ritchie Humphreys announced himself on the opening day of the 1996 season, on the same afternoon that a midfielder a couple of years older was serving notice of his own talent with a remarkable goal from the halfway line against Wimbledon. This one was, inevitably, scored from a lesser distance than David Beckham\u2019s, but it was still a thing of beauty, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wA8GHGeje00#t=0m48s\">a splendid, thumping volley from the edge of the area</a> to help Sheffield Wednesday win a home game against Aston Villa.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/sep/09/golden-goals-niall-quinn-and-kevin-phillips-for-sunderland-v-chelsea-1999\">Golden Goals: Niall Quinn and Kevin Phillips for Sunderland v Chelsea (1999) | Rob Smyth</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Three days later they visited Leeds, whose Sheffield-born manager Howard Wilkinson had moved to Elland Road from Hillsborough eight years earlier and was, as it turned out, a few weeks away from losing his job. Wednesday won 2-0, with Humphreys opening the scoring. He played the first hour of a 2-1 win at Newcastle that Saturday, before scoring the winner against Leicester in their following game.</p> <p>And <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj8mF64Bm9A\">what a winner it was</a>. Humphreys was 10 yards outside his penalty area when a Leicester attack broke down, and after a clearance was headed into the centre circle by Andy Booth he sprinted forwards to reach the ball first and set off down the centre of the pitch. To his left David Hirst made a series of runs, distracting one defender and leaving Julian Watts to deal with Humphreys. He did this unconvincingly, beguiled as the young Yorkshireman carried the ball forwards with successive touches of his left foot, jinking one way then the other, before from 20 yards clipping the ball over Kasey Keller and into the net. It was a moment of individual skill, vision and audacity, one that ranked alongside any of the several unforgettable goals \u2013 Eric Cantona\u2019s chip against Sunderland, Beckham\u2019s against Wimbledon, Trevor Sinclair\u2019s 20-yard overhead kick for QPR \u2013 scored that season (though for some reason, despite winning September\u2019s goal of the month award, it failed to make the BBC\u2019s goal of the season shortlist).</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj8mF64Bm9A\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/xj8mF64Bm9A?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>The goal that looked sure to give Humphreys\u2019 career lift-off.</figcaption> </figure>   <h2>Like a Dutch master</h2> <p>\u201cI actually played in midfield that night, which is maybe why I ran the ball from inside my own half,\u201d Humphreys says. \u201cIf you watch it now, Hirsty\u2019s asking for the ball the whole time, and normally a young player will just give it to the senior pro, but this time I just kept going. When I got near the goal I decided to try the chip. That\u2019s the youthfulness, that\u2019s just playing without any fear. You\u2019re not thinking about missing the chance and hearing the groans from the crowd. Obviously it worked out for me that night.\u201d</p> <p>Humphreys had won his place in Wednesday\u2019s lineup after Hirst and Mark Bright had been injured in pre-season. \u201cI had some problems,\u201d remembers David Pleat, Wednesday\u2019s manager. \u201cHirst had his injury issues and was overweight and Bright had seen better days, if I\u2019m honest. Humphreys was a decent footballer. He had good control, he was good with his back to goal \u2013 broad-shouldered, strong for his age, so he could look after the ball. He didn\u2019t worry about coming up against the more physical opponents and the one thing that held him back, and what stopped him from being a top centre forward, was his pace. If he\u2019d been quicker it would have given him half a chance. We took him on a pre-season tour of Holland and he scored a wonderful goal that Van Basten would have been proud of, and then of course we started off like a bomb.\u201d</p> <p>That pre-season strike came against Utrecht, which as it happens was Van Basten\u2019s first club. A story that did the rounds after his breakthrough suggested Johan Cruyff had witnessed this game and declared Humphreys the heir to Van Basten himself, though the truth was a little more prosaic. \u201cIt was a bit of a run from the halfway line and I scored with my right foot, which was a real rarity,\u201d Humphreys says. \u201cIt was their open day and Van Basten had been invited back. I\u2019m presuming a journalist said, \u2018What about that Wednesday No9?\u2019 and he politely said, \u2018Oh yeah, he\u2019s got a good future.\u2019 I don\u2019t think he said, \u2018He\u2019s the next Van Basten.\u2019 Somehow it ended up with Cruyff saying I was the new Van Basten. At Hartlepool we played West Ham in the League Cup, I can\u2019t remember the year [it was 2009], and I got asked this question about Cruyff said this and Van Basten said that. I told them exactly what I thought happened, and they didn\u2019t print that. They printed what they wanted. It\u2019ll be there forever now.\u201d</p> <h2>A career built on dedication</h2> <p>The day his finest goal of all floated into the net at Hillsborough was Monday 2 September 1996, and after winning each of their four games Wednesday held a three-point cushion at the top of the league. The free-scoring Humphreys, then 18 years old, and his club could each look ahead to a future of spectacular potential. It hasn\u2019t worked out the way either of them might have imagined.</p> <p>Until that moment Sheffield had been one of the great cities of English football, but their clubs have since endured an extended decline. It took two more games, both defeats, for Wednesday to be knocked off the top of the table, and they have not been back since. As in two of the previous four seasons they ended that one seventh, with a star-studded squad that included Des Walker, Chris Waddle, Benito Carbone and Regi Blinker, but they have not bothered the top half of the top flight again. In 108 years between the foundation of the Football League in 1892 and 2000 there were only 13 in which Sheffield was not represented in the English top flight, and 42 in which Wednesday and United were both there. In 16 years since 2000, when Wednesday were relegated, the city has been out of the top division for 15 and the Owls have not been back at all.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"158e9f30c94c708b7ceff3e29577c280ee5b92d1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/158e9f30c94c708b7ceff3e29577c280ee5b92d1/0_41_1536_922/1000.jpg\" alt=\"David Pleat, Benito Carbone and a bowl of carbohydrates.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">David Pleat, Benito Carbone and a bowl of carbohydrates.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: By Paul Barker/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>As for Humphreys, England\u2019s great goalscoring hope did not have the career anyone might have expected. For a start, for all the gifts we glimpsed at its inception and though he has played in 648 (and counting) league games he was last seen in the top flight in 1999, and has made only seven appearances in the second tier. More surprising than that, over the years he has played more often in defence than attack. Now 38, he has been chairman of the PFA since 2013, coaches at Chesterfield and remains available for selection for first-team duties.</p> <p>The traits that have led to this longevity were obvious from the start. Waddle remembers that at Wednesday \u201cI looked at him and thought, \u2018You\u2019re all right, your attitude will take you a hell of a long way.\u2019 He was a great kid to work with. He just took it all in, the praise and the criticism, and would work even harder the next day.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/aug/19/golden-goal-david-beckham-manchester-united-wimbledon-1996-halfway-line\">Golden Goal: David Beckham for Manchester United against Wimbledon (1996)</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Pleat remembers Humphreys as \u201ca quiet boy. What he\u2019s achieved is a great credit to his dedication and honesty.\u201d That Wednesday team contained a mix of \u201cwhat I call fading stars\u201d \u2013 John Sheridan (\u201ca marvellous passer but never very quick\u201d), Waddle (\u201cvery popular with the fans, but obviously he\u2019d lost his ability to burst\u201d) and Walker (\u201ccontrary\u201d) \u2013 but Pleat credits their success to a nucleus of less decorated players, including Humphreys, Peter Atherton, Graham Hyde, Guy Whittingham and Lee Briscoe. \u201cThese boys, I can\u2019t explain it, they\u2019d won nothing but they wanted to win something.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cPeople ask about the players I\u2019ve played with, the Di Canios and Waddles. For a football fan and lover of the game, to play with these players early in my career, that was an amazing upbringing. It taught me about the game,\u201d says Humphreys. \u201cIt was a bit strict back then, as a YTS player, the jobs you had to do. That taught me a lot about life, it turned a young lad into a young man. If I didn\u2019t work hard and sacrifice a lot of things, I probably wouldn\u2019t have got that opportunity in the first place.\u201d</p> <p>Having scored his first three league goals in the space of four games, Humphreys had to wait nearly three years to double his tally. \u201cAfter I left [in November 1997] Ron Atkinson came in and went and spent all their money, which Ron was good at doing, and Ritchie eventually became displaced and was allowed to leave,\u201d remembers Pleat. When Humphreys left Wednesday in 2001 he had a total of four league goals. \u201cI\u2019ve scored a couple of good ones since then, a couple of runs that were similar to the Leicester goal but without a chip at the end, and a couple of volleys,\u201d he says. \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever caught one as sweet as I did that one against Villa, though. That was as perfect as you\u2019ll ever get. I would say I\u2019ve probably not scored many scruffy tap-ins. A lot of my goals have been OK, they\u2019ve been quite good goals, but that\u2019s not good enough if you\u2019re looking for your striker to get you 25 a season.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3fdf8de79c0307498dc855f082b74a347639dca4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3fdf8de79c0307498dc855f082b74a347639dca4/0_51_2497_1498/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Humphreys\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Humphreys celebrates scoring against West Ham 1999, but by then his Premier League days were numbered.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Craig Prentis/ALLSPORT</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>He joined Hartlepool in 2001, scoring five goals in his first season. The following year he played in midfield and got 11, his most prolific season (he has averaged one goal every 13.8 league games). \u201cSince then I\u2019ve been a kind of jack of all trades, master of none,\u201d he says. \u201cI think what it\u2019s done is helped my longevity, understanding and being able to play in a few positions, and being left-footed has always helped me. You have to become reliable as well, and obviously going past 700 professional games you\u2019ve got a lot of knowhow. At Hartlepool my time was split between left-back and left wing but I played every position except right full-back and goalkeeper.\u201d</p> <h2>Bona fide legend</h2> <p>He may not always have played in the same position, but at least he always played: by the time Humphreys left Pools in 2013 he was their all-time greatest appearance-maker. He was named player of the season three times and at the awards evening in 2008 he swept the board, being named players\u2019 and supporters\u2019 player of the year, player of the decade and player of the century. \u201cThose goals gave me a great start to my career,\u201d he says. \u201cI couldn\u2019t sustain the goalscoring, or playing to a standard required of a Premier League or even a Championship player. That\u2019s not doing myself down. I don\u2019t take anything for granted. But would I have been happy back then if I\u2019d have been offered the career I\u2019ve had? Yeah. I probably wouldn\u2019t have believed it. To play more than 600 league games, to represent my country at Under-21 level \u2013 yeah, more than happy. I know it\u2019s not the norm, so to play beyond 35 years as well, when the average lifespan in football is so short, I feel unbelievably privileged and lucky to have played for so long at this level.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a23b5f18219c2dfddb793e83672ff6981cefe58d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a23b5f18219c2dfddb793e83672ff6981cefe58d/0_46_2562_1537/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Humphreys and Carlton Cole\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Humphreys, left, watches as Carlton Cole contest a challenge during an FA Cup tie between Hartlepool and West Ham in 2009.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Owen Humphreys/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>And now, 20 years after he was the young pup picking up tips from the likes of Waddle and Sheridan, Humphreys is helping the next generation to come through. \u201cIt\u2019s a real privilege to be there at the start of someone\u2019s journey, to give them the right information not just about tactics and technical ability but about being a professional footballer and what it takes, not just at the football club but away from it, how you eat and sleep and recover and do everything you can to give yourself the best chance,\u201d he says. \u201cBecause it\u2019s not always the best players who stay in the game, it\u2019s the desire and the attitude to listen and learn and implement the things the coaches tell them. I certainly think for myself, having the right attitude has had a lot to do with where I\u2019ve managed to get in my career.\u201d</p> <p>Pleat still speaks of Humphreys with almost paternal warmth. \u201cI was so pleased the PFA selected him to be their man,\u201d he says. \u201cHe\u2019s an absolute perfect example. It proves you don\u2019t have to be a star to be respected by your peers as a top-class professional and a credit to the game.\u201d</p> <p>For many he shone only briefly, visible for little longer than it took for his delicate chip to soar over Keller and settle in the back of the Leicester net 20 years ago. For others, whose focus runs a little further down the football pyramid, he is a bona fide legend. Either way, Humphreys was a star alright.</p>",
  "<p>Driving games used to matter. Like, really matter. When the original PlayStation was launched against Sega\u2019s Saturn almost 22 years ago, the two consoles were judged on their respective racing sims: Ridge Racer and Daytona USA. Before fighting games took over, these were the standard bearers of polygonal visuals that introduced players to the concept of real-time graphics rendered in three dimensions. </p> <p>Since then, at the accessible end of the driving sim genre, we\u2019ve had the brilliant Burnout, the endlessly reconfigured <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/gamesblog/2010/nov/16/need-for-speed-hot-pursuit-review\">Need for Speed</a>, the innovative <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/gamesblog/2011/feb/14/test-drive-unlimited-2-review\">Test Drive Unlimited</a> and the gorgeous <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2007/oct/31/thegear.steveboxer\">Project Gotham Racing</a> \u2013 all venerated in their time. But over the last few years, interest in the arcade racer has waned, a state of affairs symbolised by the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/gamesblog/2011/feb/18/bizarre-creations-closes\">sad closure of Bizarre Creations in 2011</a>, a British studio that truly understood how to make flashy, beautiful driving games for the mainstream market.</p> <p>Now, there is another. </p> <p>Leamington-based developer Playground Games has already proved itself with the first two <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/gamesblog/2012/oct/16/forza-horizon-review\">Forza Horizon</a> titles \u2013 joyous open-world racers with bags of modes, features and cars, and a fun premise: a festival of car racing where the player is free to explore, compete and discover new cars to their heart\u2019s content. Forza Horizon 3, ostensibly, is more of the same. You get a vast chunk of Australia to tear around, and everywhere you go there are races to enter, PR stunts to pull and rare hidden cars to dig out and do up. Want to go one-on-one with a freight train? Or a car being winched by a helicopter? Sure, that\u2019s fine. Go for it.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"aec4ca25b7f5e86bef210dcff45cab2f563f024c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/aec4ca25b7f5e86bef210dcff45cab2f563f024c/765_314_3075_1846/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Forza Horizon 3\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Landscapes take in cites, rural expanses and industrial areas, all providing the requisite chicanes, ramps and smooth straights necessary for an arcade racer experience.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Microsoft</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This time, though, you are running the festival not just taking part, and putting in good performances behind the wheel earns you more spectators allowing you to open new sites around the country. It\u2019s a nice conceit that emulates the flow and feel of a role-playing adventure, allowing you to gradually unlock massive new expanses of motoring pleasure. On top of this, the new Drivatar Management element, which lets you recruit a team of star drivers to boost your points-earning potential, brings in a strategy element, which, once again, adds to your sense of empowerment and engagement while ensuring you don\u2019t have to spend hours playing something along the lines of Motoring Event Tycoon.</p> <p>But, oh goodness, the handling. The handling is sublime. Every model in Forza Horizon 3, from the exotic street racers to the open-wheel buggies, is genuinely different to drive \u2013 not just in the cornering (which is where handling subtleties are usually most obvious), but in the underlying road feel, the friction of tyre on surface, the frisson of acceleration, the gut punch of the brakes. There is so much information, so much nuance, but the model is so refined and sympathetic that the casual driver is never overloaded or made to feel stupid or incompetent. The back-end of that over-powered Dodge Charger certainly will slither out from beneath you like an out-of-control water hose, but mostly you\u2019ll wrestle it back rather than endlessly spin into a ravine. </p> <p>At the same time, the game\u2019s delicate balance and measured implementation of real-world physics mean that it is also interesting for more skilled drivers \u2013 particularly if you tweak the various settings (ABS, TC, stability control, tyre dynamics, steering) to make the experience more realistic. The difference between the default mode for the steering and \u2018simulation\u2019 may not seem significant at first, but it does become apparent after extended driving \u2013 and certainly when you\u2019re trying to stop a Koenigsegg Regera from swapping ends on the loose Australian Outback dust. Horizon is, as we know, directly related to the core Forza engine but sufficiently distanced that it offers a distinct personality albeit without breaking out of the family circuit. What you end up with is with a set of handling dynamics that are mostly unobtrusive and instinctive regardless of the category of car you\u2019re driving, fitting the game experience beautifully. </p> <p>The different characteristics of the surfaces you drive on are also convincingly conveyed throughout. Whether you\u2019re tearing up the urban tarmac in a Jaguar F-Type, swooping over the impossibly golden beaches of Byron Bay in Halo\u2019s Warthog, or cutting through dense rainforest courtesy of your F-150 Raptor, you\u2019re getting the feedback you expect (helped immensely, it has to be said, by excellent rumble feedback from the Xbox One controller). And while novelty vehicles can sometimes lose their allure quite quickly, carefully modelled outliers like the Ariel Nomad and GMC Vandura provide enough genuine pleasure to earn a lasting place in your garage.</p> <p>But the real star of this show is Australia itself \u2013 or rather Playground Games\u2019 environmental artistry. Forza Horizon 3 is just beautiful. From the towering skyscrapers of Surfer\u2019s Paradise to the burning ochre nightmare-scapes of the outback, this is a game that offers more sheer scenic pleasure than the entire Constable collection at Tate Britain. While many open-world driving games can seem somehow soulless and utterly simulated, this universe is stuffed with detail and drama, be it a crowd of hot air balloons drifting through the evening sky, or a building site, jammed with ramps and hazards. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"18728c59969652c417bf27f028384c329251a19f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/18728c59969652c417bf27f028384c329251a19f/0_309_3084_1851/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The landscape is littered with Danger Jump points, where players can earn huge rewards for reenacting the ending of Thelma and Louise\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The landscape is littered with Danger Jump points, where players can earn huge rewards for reenacting the ending of Thelma and Louise.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Microsoft</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This is the state of the art for video game visuals \u2013 just as Ridge Racer and Daytona were 20 years ago. If you have a 4K television with HDR support, it\u2019s pretty much an essential purchase (the sun beams seem to reach out into the room). Certainly, we\u2019ve had beautiful driving games before, but it\u2019s rare to find one with a setting that\u2019s so entrenched in the quality of the experience being delivered. </p> <p>Alongside the single-player game, there are various co-op and online multiplayer tournaments and modes to get stuck into. These can be epic road journeys with a friend, or moments of brutal, idiotic fun against a whole bunch of strangers playing tag in their beautiful sports cars. Matchmaking seems seamless at this stage, but there\u2019s room to set up clubs with likeminded racers if the anonymous masses on the public servers become too much. However you play, the game throws options at you with almost careless abandon, the vast map regularly twinkling with unlocked options. </p> <p>That, really, is the fundamental value in Forza Horizon 3. It wants you to have fun. It will challenge you, it will ask you to improve as a driver and it will reward you for doing so. But first and foremost, it wants you to spend time in this ridiculous playground, with some of the best (and strangest) cars in the world, having an absolute blast. </p> <p><strong>Microsoft; Xbox One (version tested)/PC; \u00a345; Pegi rating: 3+</strong></p>",

He will now retire in February, halfway through the one-year extension to his original contract.</p> <p>His announcement came ahead of the release next month of a report on the Met\u2019s handling of historical sex abuse cases, which is expected to be critical, though probably not of the commissioner.

Crime fell by 18% during most of his time in office, though some categories are now rising.</p> <p>His predecessor, Sir Paul Stephenson, was forced from the job as a result of the phone-hacking scandal, and before him, Sir Ian Blair quit after he was told he had lost Johnson\u2019s confidence.</p> <p>Hogan-Howe\u2019s biggest achievement may well have been to show that the job of Met commissioner is not impossible, even though it is beset by political hurdles. The last commissioner of the Met to complete their term was Sir John Stevens in 2005. </p> <p>Colleagues say Hogan-Howe is politically astute. To meet the big reduction in government funding, the Met will soon move out of its current headquarters to a new building. It has cut \u00a3600m from its budget and Hogan-Howe, after much deliberation, spoke out against the Conservative government that appointed him.</p> <p>Hogan-Howe was unpopular in some sections of the media for the pursuit of journalists over phone-hacking and bribery claims. He also faced calls to quit over Operation Midland, an inquiry into claims VIPs had abused children decades ago. The operation is alleged to have spiralled out of control and collapsed without unearthing evidence of guilt.</p> <p>One of those investigated, the former Tory MP Harvey Proctor, said: \u201cHe will walk away with a barrow-load of pension funds. I am left destitute. Is there any wonder that I believe Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe should leave in shame and should have left many months ago? </p> <p>\u201cHe is a disgrace to the police force of Britain. He has wrought havoc on the Metropolitan Police Service, whose good reputation he and other senior officers have tarnished in the last few years.\u201d </p> <p>Under Hogan-Howe\u2019s tenure, the Met successfully policed the 2012 London Olympics, but the officer who oversaw the Games soon left the organisation because Hogan-Howe had a particular vision of whom he wanted in his top team. </p> <p>The Met is regarded as having done a good job in the face of the heightened terrorist threat, although the government has considered passing the responsibility to the relatively new National Crime Agency, an idea the Met has so far successfully resisted.</p> <p>Met staff morale hit <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/jun/07/majority-met-police-officers-not-confident-in-leadership\">record lows</a> in 2014 but the force maintained officer numbers at 32,000 as it restructured and tried to adapt to the changing nature of crime, particularly cyber offences.</p> <p>Rudd, the home secretary, said: \u201cSir Bernard has had a long and distinguished career as a determined crimefighter and an inspirational senior officer.

It has fuelled fears that the inquiry is \u201ccareering out of control\u201d and left many survivors questioning whether it can carry out its work.</p> <p>On Thursday, Theresa May insisted that the inquiry, which she set up while she was home secretary, would not be scaled back.

He said: \u201cThis has been chaotic from the beginning, appalling appointments made without any consultation \u2013 that\u2019s the real problem.

The use of Adams &amp; Co means customers will not have to be handed new sort codes.</p> <p>The announcement that RBS is pressing on with the ringfence \u2013 which must be completed by the start of 2019 \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/sep/29/commerzbank-job-cuts-restructuring\">comes amid turbulence in financial markets</a> sparked by fears about the ability of Deutsche Bank to pay a $14bn (\u00a311bn) penalty from US regulators. It evokes memories of the crisis that hit the markets eight years ago when Lehman Brothers collapsed and eventually led, in October 2008, to a bailout for RBS.</p> <p>It also comes as Ross McEwan, the RBS chief executive, begins his fourth year running a bank that has incurred \u00a352bn of losses since taxpayers pumped in \u00a345bn to keep it afloat. He has distanced the bank from the empire-building of Goodwin, who left after the bailout and after plastering the RBS logo across Formula One cars and Edinburgh airport.</p> <p>\u201cThe future ringfenced structure of the bank is not only designed to be in compliance with the new regulatory requirements and objectives, but will better reflect who we are as a bank and what we stand for: a bank that is focused on its customers,\u201d said McEwan.</p> <p>\u201cOur proposed future structure under the ringfencing legislation and our brand strategy are key elements of the bank we are becoming.\u201d<br></p> <p>Last week, RBS <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/sep/23/royal-bank-scotland-turns-back-fred-goodwin-era-natwest-ads\">began a new advertising campaign</a>, which signalled that the NatWest brand would be given more prominence in England and Wales and set out that in Scotland it would be known as \u201cThe Royal Bank\u201d.</p> <p>The situation has been complicated by the failure of RBS to sell off the 300 branches it was required to by the EU as a penalty for state aid. These Williams &amp; Glyn branches are supposed to be sold by the end of next year, although McEwan warned this week that the bank faced uncharted territory if it failed to do so.</p>",
  "<p>I can\u2019t say I wrote the book on Lil Wayne but I did write <a href=\"http://www.flametreepublishing.com/Lil-Wayne.html\"><em>a </em>book</a>. This was in late 2010, Dwayne Michael Carter Jr was midway through <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/jul/08/lil-wayne-prison-memoir-unlikely-jailhouse-pen-pal\">an eight-month sentence</a> at New York\u2019s Rikers Island for gun possession, and I was cobbling together a sort of biography. This book was a cuts job, which meant I assembled information from what other people had written and fudged things into a cohesive narrative while glossing over his relationship with drugs and guns because of the teenage target readership. In the four or five years since this book was released, however, the decline of Wayne\u2019s career has been unavoidable \u2013 lacking in creative output and overwhelmingly centred around his legal dispute with his friend and mentor, Cash Money Records\u2019 founder Birdman. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"a988169bd78abe178281a113fbbccda5dfcef955\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a988169bd78abe178281a113fbbccda5dfcef955/0_197_2087_2607/801.jpg\" alt=\"Lil Wayne at the VMAs in 2011.\" width=\"801\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lil Wayne at the VMAs in 2011.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Matt Sayles/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This rift will no doubt fill the pages of his forthcoming memoir. Entitled Gone \u2019Til November, it is based on the journals that Wayne wrote in prison, documents I too studied as part of my research process. It is said to feature \u201chis thoughts and feelings about spending time in Rikers Island, the people he met, his whole family, his past, his future, and more\u201d. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/drake\">Drake</a>\u2019s in it too, as is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/sep/26/lil-wayne-officiated-same-sex-wedding-memoir\">a story about a wedding at which he officiated</a> for two fellow inmates and a reception for which he decorated a room with toilet paper and toasted with Gatorade. Rappers apparently love Gatorade. I tried drinking it during the process, to go method. It\u2019s pretty horrible.</p> <p>For the uninitiated, Lil Wayne was born in New Orleans and is covered in tattoos. No one really knows how many there are but suffice to say he looks like a map. He has grills and a vacillating relationship with various drugs (most interestingly sizzurp, a codeine-based \u201cdrink\u201d which is either the cause or death of his creativity). He is famously a southern rapper, short, difficult (and of a difficult upbringing) and now a father of four. He is not the best rapper by any stretch. His voice is awkward, at times tired, with a grating cadence (<a href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2007/08/13/high-and-mighty\">Sasha Frere-Jones generously compared his voice to Dylan\u2019s</a> in the New Yorker in 2007). But lyrically, there\u2019s something uncapped in how he views the world, thick with pessimism and humour. Be it astute metaphors (\u201cI put up a wall, and they just wallpaper\u201d), absurd references to beetroot (he\u2019s vegetarian), puns (\u201cWhen it Wayne\u2019s it pours\u201d) or multiple references to the poet <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/aug/23/langston-hughes-harlem-house-art-collective-renee-watson\">Langston Hughes</a>, he is possessed of a skittish talent that is both unfocused and fascinating especially to someone like me who cannot relate to anything he raps about on any level. Except, perhaps, that we are similar in age and both have plans to retire in two years. </p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7tOAGY59uQ\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/c7tOAGY59uQ?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>EXPLICIT: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7tOAGY59uQ\">Lil Wayne\u2019s 6 Foot 7 Foot</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>For one of the most unusual and prolific artists of the past 15 years, Lil Wayne has recently been anything but. He remains relevant (collaborating with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/may/10/yung-lean-review-sad-boys\">Yung Lean</a> and guests on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/sep/28/solange-new-album-q-tip-lil-wayne-kelly-rowland-a-seat-at-the-table\">Solange\u2019s new album A Seat at the Table</a>), but musically has been camped out in Gethsemane twiddling his thumbs over a stalemate surrounding the release of an album. </p> <p>He was due to release Tha Carter V in 2014 but decided against it, at least under the umbrella of Cash Money Records, the label founded by Birdman. He then <a href=\"http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/lil-wayne-sues-cash-money-for-51-million-20150128\">sued Cash Money</a>, demanding $51m and a release from his contract, pointing towards all manner of alleged monetary misdeeds. It also transpired that he wanted ownership of the Cash Money imprint he ran, called Young Money Entertainment, as well as the artists he signed: Drake and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/nicki-minaj\">Nicki Minaj</a>. The row has been playing out for years, intermittently, veering from the silly (throwing drinks at one another) to the serious (Wayne\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/lil-wayne-tour-bus-shooter-receives-20-year-sentence-20151120\">tour buses were shot at</a> by, it\u2019s alleged, a \u201cfriend\u201d of Birdman). <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/jul/28/birdman-lil-wayne-hes-my-son-angie-martinez\">Their love/hate, father/son relationship</a> has played out, Cronus-like, ever since and raises the question as to whether it\u2019s money, attention or creativity which is fuelling the rift and, moreover, whether anyone cares anymore. Whatever. The fight has become white noise, groaning under the weight of its legal contracts, and feels like fodder for TMZ rather than anything concrete.</p> <p>Gone \u2019Til November is therefore likely to level out as some sort of battle cry, a literary scream in lieu of a musical one which is a shame, because once upon a time Lil Wayne\u2019s output was tremendous: 12 albums, and double that in mixtapes (all of which came wrapped in makeshift zine-y covers) on which he used to release his most reactive and non-commercial content.</p> <p>Following Katrina, New Orleans\u2019s comprehensive battering and George W Bush\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2005/sep/02/hurricanekatrina.usa1\">utter mismanagement of the situation</a>, Lil Wayne became his home town\u2019s voice. Songs like <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Iex5BEXR2w\">Georgia Bush</a>, a brutal impeachment of George Bush\u2019s handling of Katrina, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2008/jun/13/urban.shopping1\">Tha Carter III</a>\u2019s Tie My Hands, which manages to be both accusatory and commercial \u2013 \u201cMy whole city under water, some people still floating\u201d \u2013 were ballads for the disenfranchised south. He put money into New Orleans to rebuild parks and schools, becoming a philanthropist for the city.

He had sold more than 3m copies of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2008/jun/15/urban.reviews\">Tha Carter III</a> album and won a Grammy . But his experimental work with rock (<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HqYo-m7NBSM&amp;list=PLTKJKE-nCTUaZse3dcZ6TdxWRvfyu4IWi\">Rebirth</a>, pretty terrible) and a shift away from music (including a confusing period of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWh5QZE8HFg\">serious, serious skateboarding</a>) pushed him off trajectory and lyrically, his relevance began to peter out. He cares about New Orleans, and his roots, representing both beyond physical boundaries, but he also cares about drugs, women and <a href=\"http://pantograph-punch.com/eat-it-up-and-lay-wit-it-hip-hop-cunnilingus-and-morality-in-entertainment/\">oral sex</a>. Popular rap has morphed into something else, hung with emotion and responsibility, less macho and more in touch with the current mood, a mood which doesn\u2019t quite chime with what Lil Wayne represents.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/drake\">Drake</a>, who, along with rappers such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/aug/31/young-thug-jeffery-review-inconsistent-but-worth-persevering\">Young Thug</a> and <a href=\"http://www.stereogum.com/1854051/future-best-rapper-alive/franchises/status-aint-hood/\">Future</a>, arguably wouldn\u2019t exist were it not for Lil Wayne, is a case in point and, says journalist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2008/jun/07/features16.theguide\">Hattie Collins</a>: \u201cYou can possibly trace Wayne\u2019s demise in popularity to Drake\u2019s huge rise \u2013 which was the time Wayne was sent to prison.

Barack <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yu1qtAbESr8\">Obama is a fan and has used Lil Wayne</a> as an example of the dangers of fame and <a href=\"http://www.lilwaynehq.com/2009/07/barack-obama-our-kids-cant-all-aspire-to-be-lil-wayne/\">aspiration</a> \u2013 \u201cour kids can\u2019t all aspire to be Lil Wayne\u201d. Wayne himself has always been sticky with the idea of role models, distancing himself from the responsibility which comes, proxy-like, with fame. Thomas Chatterton Williams, a US author who writes about race relations, notes: \u201cThe best role models tend to be those who assume that responsibility. Forcing someone into that [role] seems less ideal than locating people who are less famous but more worthy of the emulation.\u201d This is especially pertinent when you compare Lil Wayne to someone like <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/jul/08/jay-z-beyonce-killing-police-spiritual-alton-sterling-philando-castile\">Jay Z</a>, his one-time peer, who has<strong> </strong>\u201cconsciously attempted to move into that terrain over the past decade or so,\u201d says Williams, citing <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/21/opinion/why-mass-incarceration-doesnt-pay.html\">a recent op-ed in the New York Times on mass incarceration</a>.

He could be forgiven for panicking, choosing to avoid controversy on national TV, but the takeaway felt that this was a man who, upon witnessing his mostly white audience, wrongly translates that as white America embracing black culture. Collins says: \u201cIt\u2019s a shame, because at his best, Wayne was one of the weirdest, most interesting MCs in hip-hop who, I thought, had the potential to delve into subject matter with real political depth.\u201d</p> <p>The past few years have been a catalogue of errors for Lil Wayne. If he\u2019s done something wrong, you can bet he\u2019s been caught doing it. After all, it\u2019s quite unusual for someone of his stature and wealth \u2013 estimated in 2015 to be $150m \u2013 to actually serve time unless the justice system is at its wits\u2019 end. A comeback is not impossible \u2013 but it feels less and less likely. Which is sad, because regardless of his enumeration of criminal records, squabbles and poor life choices, of diss tracks and Styrofoam cups of sizzurp, he is a talent, off-centre, a democrat, a freak, and unswervingly honest to boot. He is, also, content in this very fallibility, which I find both comforting and triggering. So maybe, on that level, we can relate. </p> <ul> <li><a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Lil-Waynes-Gone-Til-November/dp/1911274694/ref=tmm_hrd_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&amp;qid=&amp;sr=\">Lil Wayne\u2019s memoir Gone \u2019Til November: A Journal Of Rikers Island</a> is released on 11 October by Blink Publishing. <br></li> </ul>",

  "<p>\u201cUniversity lectures are the enemy of entrepreneurship,\u201d says Michael Fowle, an entrepreneur and enterprise fellow at Northumbria University. It seems an ironic claim, given that Fowle is himself launching an<a href=\"https://www.northumbria.ac.uk/study-at-northumbria/courses/entrepreneurship-msc-ft-dtfent6/#modules\" rel=\"nofollow\"> MSc in entrepreneurship</a> at Newcastle Business School this month \u2013 but then this is no typical master\u2019s course.

But Northumbria claims its MSc is the first entirely practical master\u2019s in entrepreneurship in the UK, meaning any academic written work is \u201coptional\u201d. For a fee of \u00a310,000, a class of around eight to 15 students will spend the year trying to launch their own startups to earn credits on the programme \u2013 and ideally some real-life revenue. The course includes a business accelerator for students to experiment with new business ideas under supervision from five entrepreneurship coaches.<br></p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>You can become more entrepreneurial through experience and teamwork</p> <footer> <cite>Michael Fowle</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Fowle insists on the term \u201ccoaches\u201d rather than tutors, to focus on what he calls \u201caction-learning\u201d. The degree is assessed not through essays or examinations, but through weekly review sessions. He believes the lack of academic rigour will be reconciled with an intensive workload. \u201cYou will need to be completely immersed. You can\u2019t have a hobby.

It\u2019s possible that you won\u2019t be able to have friends,\u201d he says.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Fowle describes his ideal student as someone with a business idea who has not studied a business course at university. He envisages them being recent graduates not too entrenched in their careers, for instance, or perhaps older parents whose children have left home. \u201cWe\u2019ve found from the applicants that they wouldn\u2019t get support from their families for a normal business startup because it\u2019s too high-risk; whereas the MSc was considered to be less risky,\u201d he says.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>But given the \u00a310,000 fee, the course can\u2019t exactly be called risk-free.

One of its alumni is Sam Clegg, 27, who graduated from Northumbria University in 2014.

  "<p>Since its inception in 1990, functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_magnetic_resonance_imaging\">fMRI</a>) has revolutionised the way we think about the brain. In association with other techniques, it provides invaluable clues to understand brain disorders, like psychosis or dementia. At its heart, fMRI is a medical imaging technique that allows scientists to look at where oxygenated blood is being directed around the brain \u2013 if a brain area is being used for a particular task, it will need more oxygen. So by extension, fMRI allows us to look at how information is processed in the brain, and is one of the few techniques we have to look directly into a person\u2019s brain while they are thinking.</p> <p>However, this past summer has seen a series of alarmist headlines about the technique cropping up in the media. There have been claims that <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/kevinmurnane/2016/07/07/new-research-suggests-that-tens-of-thousands-of-fmri-brain-studies-may-be-flawed/#38424d027de4\">\u2018Tens of Thousands of fmri brain studies may be flawed\u2019</a>, and that a <a href=\"http://www.wired.co.uk/article/fmri-bug-brain-scans-results\">\u2018bug in fMRI software calls 15 years of research into question\u2019</a> (also<a href=\"http://www.theregister.co.uk/2016/07/03/mri_software_bugs_could_upend_years_of_research/\"> here</a>, and up to 20 years<a href=\"http://www.fastcoexist.com/3061577/20-years-worth-of-fmri-studies-may-be-bunk-thanks-to-a-software-error\"> here</a>), and even that fMRI as no scientific value (\u2018<a href=\"http://www.theregister.co.uk/2016/07/07/the_great_brain_scan_scandal_it_isnt_just_boffins_who_should_be_ashamed/\">the great brain scan scandal</a>\u2019) or that <a href=\"http://ideas.ted.com/much-of-what-we-know-about-the-brain-may-be-wrong-the-problem-with-fmri/?utm_campaign=social&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=facebook.com&amp;utm_content=ideas-blog&amp;utm_term=science\">much of what we know about the brain may be wrong</a>. But is fMRI research really in such a sorry state?</p> <p>The furor finds its origins in a study in the July issue of the <a href=\"http://www.pnas.org/content/113/28/7900.full\">Proceeding of the National Academy of Science</a> by Anders Eklund, Thomas Nichols and Hans Knutsson. Despite being in use for some 25 years, some of the most common statistical analyses used on fMRI data haven\u2019t been fully assessed for accuracy. To address this, Eklund and his team set out to measure the false positive rates of standard task fMRI methods. A false positive is when we wrongly conclude an effect is present, when in reality there is no effect. A pregnancy test that comes out positive when the woman is not pregnant is one example of this type of error. When it comes to fMRI data, a false positive could be that an area of the brain is declared activated by a task, when in reality it is not. Eklund\u2019s work is essential because it allows us to ascertain the scientific validity of fMRI \u2013 in other words, how much we can be sure that we\u2019re measured what we think we\u2019re measuring.</p> <p>Once signals from the MRI machine are recorded, many analysis steps take place and \u2018maps\u2019 of activation can be created, showing which areas of the brain are in use, and which are not. Given the complexity of the method, it is impossible to completely eliminate false positives from these maps, so researchers use statistical tests that try to control errors to a desired (usual small) rate. The key finding from the PNAS paper is that, one method typically used in fMRI analysis can give a much higher false positive rate than expected \u2013 in some cases, a chance of up to 70% that the software might produce a false positive when 5% was expected.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/head-quarters/2015/aug/28/reproducibility-project-psychology-research-hopeless-case-or-pioneering-field\">Psychology research: hopeless case or pioneering field? | Dorothy Bishop</a> </p> </aside>  <p>This might sound disastrous, but it\u2019s not actually completely new. As <a href=\"http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/neuroskeptic/2016/07/07/false-positive-fmri-mainstream/\">Neuroskeptic</a> has pointed out, this study is the culmination of work that has been going on for a number of years, with the novel contribution here being that Eklund\u2019s team illustrated the problem empirically, based on openly available data, identified the origin of the problems, and provided an alternative solution to standard methods. </p> <p>So what can we really conclude from the study? First, it is not true that tens of thousands of studies are affected. Not all fMRI studies use the methods called into question. As pointed out on one of the author\u2019s<a href=\"http://blogs.warwick.ac.uk/nichols/entry/bibliometrics_of_cluster/\"> blog</a>, around 3500 studies (or less than 10% of existing fMRI studies) used the method called into question. It is equally important to note that this also does not mean the discoveries from all 3500 of these studies are false; the effects in some studies could be so strong to be detected even despite this problem, or the findings in others could be weak but have subsequently been replicated. Unfortunately, we have no way of knowing the status of each of these studies, as data from published studies was not shared or archived for reanalysis. </p> <p>Another headline claim was that 15 years of research are called into question because of a bug. The bug reported in the paper concerns an error in one piece of software (<a href=\"https://afni.nimh.nih.gov/afni\">AFNI</a>, the least used of the three tested) leading to higher error rates than expected (this bug was fixed in 2015). As the authors note, this bug contributed to inflated false positive rates, but is only a small factor relative to the problems common to all three software packages. </p> <p>In short, for those who see these problems as the death knell for fMRI, they are simply missing the point of this line of work - which is to make the science more robust. When controversial issues like these have arisen in the past, far from throwing the baby out with the bath water, the scientific community has instead responded strongly and raised standards.

While 90% of families with children aged under five had used their local park at least once in the past month, the study said, 92% of park managers had had their budgets cut and 95% were facing further reductions. <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>The cuts have raised concerns that parks could become hubs for crime and antisocial behaviour, or be sold off to developers or private companies.</p> <p>There has been public outrage when councils have sold off sections of the parks under their control, such as an <a href=\"http://www.hamhigh.co.uk/news/anger_as_go_ape_course_is_approved_for_alexandra_palace_1_4460565\">approval this year for part of Alexandra Park</a> in north London to be sold to the outdoor adventure company Go Ape. </p> <p>Dave Morris, the chair of the National Federation of Parks and Green Spaces, said: \u201cThe only way to halt the ever-deepening funding crisis affecting all parks across the UK is to make it a statutory service.\u201d<br></p> <p>He added: \u201cParks take a long time to fall apart. It\u2019s not immediately noticeable, like a library closing, but all the pillars of effective park management and maintenance are crumbling. If not reversed, parks will be plunged into the disaster crisis of the 1980s and 1990s when they became no-go areas full of syringes and no park rangers.\u201d<br></p> <p>The government inquiry is looking into how people use their parks, and what could be done to protect them. It will consider whether to recommend a change to the administrative status of national parks that will make the provision and maintenance of outdoor spaces a statutory duty.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>\u201cAll too often, the things that are really important to our day-to-day lives are ignored by politicians. But when we come together, we show we can get important issues, like our parks, on the political agenda,\u201d said Megan Bentall, a 38 Degrees campaigner.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>\u201cIn just two weeks, hundreds of thousands of 38 Degrees members have joined the campaign to protect our parks from neglect. Together we\u2019re calling on the committee to recommend our parks are legally protected. It\u2019s people-powered campaigning that is putting our lovely parks in the spotlight \u2013 to protect them for generations to come.\u201d<br></p> <p>Of the 115,000 38 Degrees members who completed the survey, 84,000 said they used parks at least once a week, with 97% saying they felt positive about the green spaces they used.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p>",

  "<p>On really bad days, Lutfi Bin Ali retrieves his Guant\u00e1namo Bay suit from under a pile of clothes and pulls it on. The outfit, which by this point has faded from its infamous orange colour to more of a salmony pink, reminds him he was once worse off than he is now, and helps him to calm down.<br></p> <p>Sometimes, though, he wonders if his current predicament might actually be even worse than the 13 years he spent in the notorious prison. Lonely and isolated in the Kazakh steppe, the 51-year-old Tunisian has found life since his release from Guant\u00e1namo no easier than life inside.</p> <p>\u201cAt least in Gu\u00e1ntanamo there were people to talk to. Here I have nobody,\u201d Bin Ali said during the Guardian\u2019s two-day visit to his new home, a dusty town in northern Kazakhstan famed for being a Soviet nuclear testing site. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--supporting\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/maps/embed/sep/2016-09-15T12:01:10.html\" data-alt=\"Semey, Kazakhstan\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/maps/embed/sep/2016-09-15T12:01:10.html\">Semey, Kazakhstan</a> </figure>  <p>Bin Ali was captured on the Pakistan-Afghanistan border in late 2001, and claims to have spent time in CIA black sites before being transferred to Guant\u00e1namo several months later. US intelligence accused him of associating with known al-Qaida members in Afghanistan and of being part of a Tunisian jihadi cell. He denied all the claims, insisting he went to Pakistan and Afghanistan to find a wife and escape minor problems with the law in Italy, where he had lived for more than a decade previously.</p> <p>According to a <a href=\"http://projects.nytimes.com/guantanamo/detainees/894-lotfi-bin-ali\">leaked Guant\u00e1namo internal assessment</a>, Bin Ali was recommended for release or transfer to another country for continued detention in June 2004. Based on his \u201chealth status, intelligence value and risk level\u201d the US defence department judged Bin Ali to pose a \u201clow risk\u201d. It was more than a decade before he would finally be freed.</p> <p>As the Obama administration has attempted to shut down Guant\u00e1namo, increased efforts have been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2014/dec/31/five-guantanamo-prisoners-flown-to-kazakhstan-for-resettlement\">made to transfer the detainees to their home nations, or third countries</a>. Bin Ali said he could not go back to Tunisia after being branded a terrorist by the Americans \u2013 he risked jail there.</p> <p>Many former prisoners, Yemenis, Tunisians and Libyans, have been transferred to third countries where they are placed in rehabilitation programmes.</p> <p>Usually they are funded by the host country, but the Kazakhstan programme is financed by the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC). The two-year programme was meant to see the former prisoners slowly integrate into Kazakh society. The reality has been rather different.</p> <p>Bin Ali has a serious heart condition that required an operation to install an artificial valve in 1999, and his US lawyer, Mark Denbeaux, said he had persuaded Bin Ali to accept the transfer to Kazakhstan based on what US authorities told him. </p> <p>\u201cThey explained to me that Kazakhstan was a Muslim country, it had an excellent healthcare system, and they had a programme to take care of him. After two years he would be free to leave. None of what I was told turned out to be true,\u201d Denbeaux said.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>When I arrived, it was -30 outside and I was still in Guantanamo flip-flops</p> <footer> <cite>Lutfi Bin Ali</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"622e875b697dff3bdfb0a1a462bc921febfe46b7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/622e875b697dff3bdfb0a1a462bc921febfe46b7/0_605_4032_2419/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Lutfi Bin Ali at his home in Semey.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lutfi Bin Ali at his home in Semey.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Shaun Walker/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>At the end of 2014, Bin Ali, along with another Tunisian detainee and three Yemenis, were transferred to Kazakhstan. The five were flown out on a military aircraft, hands and feet cuffed, and two days and several changes of transport later, Bin Ali and one of the Yemenis arrived in Semey, a town near Kazakhstan\u2019s border with Russia. The other three were sent to Kyzylorda, hundreds of miles away in southern Kazakhstan.</p> <p>After the long journey, Bin Ali was taken to a temporary apartment in Semey late on New Year\u2019s Eve. Outside there were fireworks and drunken celebrations. Inside, it was freezing.</p> <p>\u201cIt was minus 30 outside and I was still in Guant\u00e1namo flip-flops, because none of the shoes they had were big enough. I was expecting a Muslim country and it wasn\u2019t what I expected,\u201d he said. </p> <p>Semey, called Semipalatinsk until 2007, is a sleepy town of dilapidated Soviet-era apartment blocks home to around 300,000 people, more than 500 miles from Kazakhstan\u2019s largest city, Almaty. It is mainly known for its location next to the \u201cpoligon\u201d, an area of steppe where the Soviets carried out nuclear tests. Radiation levels are still well above average in the area, and many believe the tests have led to all manner of health problems. <br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--showcase\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2016/09/ended_up-zip/giv-22601ARu8DeHVt3aD/\" data-alt=\"Where have other Guant\u200b\u200b\u00e1namo releasees been sent?\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2016/09/ended_up-zip/giv-22601ARu8DeHVt3aD/\">Where have other Guant\u200b\u200b\u00e1namo releasees been sent?</a> </figure>  <p>The town\u2019s isolation and its climate of hot, dusty summers and punishingly cold winters drove Fyodor Dostoevsky to distraction during the five years he spent in exile in the town, where he had seizures and sank into depression. \u201cI live in Semipalatinsk, which bores me to death. Life has become intolerable for me,\u201d the novelist wrote in a letter in 1858.</p> <p>More than 150 years later, Bin Ali has similar feelings about the town. Few people speak English and he has found only one person, the imam of the mosque, who speaks any Arabic. At 6ft 6in (198cm), he is a foot taller than most of the town\u2019s residents, and cannot find shoes or clothes to fit.</p> <p>After their arrival, the Guant\u00e1namo five were told they would not be able to leave the confines of their host cities, and Bin Ali was not given proper care for his heart condition. </p> <p>Four months after the men were transferred, one of the Yemenis in Kyzylorda, Asim al-Khalaqi, became ill. \u201cHe was more and more ill but they didn\u2019t believe it,\u201d said Adel Hkimi, another Yemeni transferred to Kyzylorda, by telephone. \u201cHe was weak. He couldn\u2019t go out, so I did shopping for him. I asked to stay overnight to look after him but they wouldn\u2019t let me. He became sadder and angrier. He was unable to walk, or to go to the toilet.\u201d</p> <p>Finally, when it became clear just how serious the condition was, Khalaqi was taken to hospital. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/may/22/guantanamo-detainee-asim-thabit-abdullah-al-khalaqi-dies-kazakhstan\">He died the next day</a>. <br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3839cc24aa1e295bc0effaf3a1d150139eb7bd92\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3839cc24aa1e295bc0effaf3a1d150139eb7bd92/0_552_4032_2419/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The town of Semey, close to the Russian border.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The town of Semey, close to the Russian border.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Shaun Walker/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Suffering from worsening heart palpitations that kept him awake at night, Bin Ali feared the same fate. Eventually, earlier this year, he was given an operation to install another artificial valve in Astana, Kazakhstan\u2019s capital. The whole week he was there he was guarded by police. </p> <p>\u201cThey picked him up, broke him, and threw him away,\u201d said Denbeaux of the US treatment of Bin Ali. He said while the conditions in Kazakhstan might be intolerable, the Kazakhs had been \u201cdoing the Americans a favour\u201d by agreeing to take the detainees, and it was the US who must bear responsibility for the situation. \u201cIn their race to empty out Guant\u00e1namo, they are leaving people who are released in unsustainable circumstances.\u201d</p> <p>Some Kazakh officials resent the complaints. After all, Bin Ali could well be a dangerous terrorist as far as they know, and he has been given an allowance, access to medicines and a spacious flat that is luxurious by local standards, with green faux-leather sofas and imitation malachite columns.</p> <p>But it is little more than a gilded cell. His only document is a flimsy, handwritten Kazakh docket saying he is \u201ca person seeking refugee status\u201d, and he is explicitly banned from leaving the confines of the town, let alone the country. When the Guardian visited, the police arrived within half an hour, ostensibly to \u201csay hello\u201d. They demanded information on the visitor and took down passport and accreditation details.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2016/09/releases-zip/giv-22601EPyUwJXdz35Z/\" data-alt=\"Only 55 of the 174 prisoners released from Guant\u00e1namo since 2008 have been returned to their country of origin\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2016/09/releases-zip/giv-22601EPyUwJXdz35Z/\">Only 55 of the 174 prisoners released from Guant\u00e1namo since 2008 have been returned to their country of origin</a> </figure>  <p>\u201cI think they have good conditions in their daily life. The problem is they have no future there, and that has to do with the restrictions of the Kazakh government,\u201d said Jens-Martin Mehler of the ICRC\u2019s regional delegation in central Asia.</p> <p>It is understandable that the Kazakhs are suspicious. A report issued last week <a href=\"http://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-usa-militants-guantanamo-idUKKCN11K2X9?utm_campaign=crowdfire&amp;utm_content=crowdfire&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter\">suggested nine Guant\u00e1namo detainees have rejoined militant groups since 2009</a>, and the lack of any trials means it is hard to officials to distinguish between real terrorist masterminds and those arrested in error.</p> <p>Bin Ali insists there is no truth to allegations that he had links to al-Qaida. He readily admits he got into scrapes with the law before his arrest, but says they were all about petty crime rather than extremism. Born in 1965 in Tunis, he left school at 12 and worked as a furniture maker. As he turned 20 he moved to Italy on the suggestion of friends and relatives and began a 14-year period moving around the country from Milan to Brindisi. </p> <p>In 1998 he decided to move to Pakistan. In his telling, he was motivated by cash, not Islam. \u201cI did business with a lot of Pakistan people, I heard there was lots of good business there.\u201d When he got there, he had problems with the police and fled to Afghanistan. He said he spent only a month in Afghanistan, during which time he had no contact with any terrorists and never handled a weapon. He had decided the whole venture was pointless and wanted to return to Italy, via Pakistan. He was arrested by Pakistani forces in a town just across the border.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d9fd3b03aab7efaf4a91d94eb72f1c35653a69b5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d9fd3b03aab7efaf4a91d94eb72f1c35653a69b5/0_260_4032_2419/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Bin Ali wants to open a small restaurant selling Italian food some day.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lufti bin Ali wants to open a small restaurant selling Italian food some day.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Shaun Walker/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It is possible that Bin Ali\u2019s portrayal of himself as a wheeler dealer and occasional petty criminal could be a cover, but little in the leaked Guant\u00e1namo documents seems to suggest any hard evidence against him, and he has never been brought before any kind of court to answer any charges. <br></p> <p>In his new life in Semey, he has almost no company except Sabri al-Qurashi, the Yemeni Guant\u00e1namo detainee. He has learned basic Russian but locals are afraid of talking to him. </p> <p>When he is in a good mood, he enjoys cooking, although he wishes he had more people to cook for. For a visiting Guardian journalist he cooked numerous imitations of Italian dishes, which were impressive given the limitations of locally available ingredients. </p> <p>\u201cCooking is my passion. I dream of cooking for 10 or 20 people. I want to open a small restaurant here, it would be wonderful. I\u2019d do Italian food, and Sabri could do the desserts, the cakes. But the local authorities said no. They don\u2019t want us to be visible.\u201d</p> <p>Instead, he has busied himself with painting. He also wants to write a Guant\u00e1namo memoir, but he struggles to concentrate and has trouble using a computer due his poor vision, damaged during his stay in Gu\u00e1ntanamo. \u201cIt feels like there is a football match going on inside my head,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Often, he sits at home in the dark. His toes are mangled from years of walking barefoot on prison floors and being held in stress positions, and he walks with a pronounced limp. He cuts a forlorn, incongruous figure as he shuffles through the streets of Semey.</p> <p>Sometimes he thinks about putting on his orange suit, sealing his mouth with tape, and going into the main square to announce he is on hunger strike, until he receives a transfer somewhere else. He has decided against it though, on the basis that it would probably land him in a Kazakh jail, and he is not sure anyone would notice anyway.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not angry, I just wish I would be left alone.

We don\u2019t intervene.\u201d</p> <p>Three years ago, those unwritten rules started to change with the start of a <a href=\"http://www.cottonconnect.org/news/news-stories/new-report-identifies-gender-equality-as-key-issue-in-developing-a-sustainable-cotton-industry.aspx#.V-4YrzYrJyp\" rel=\"nofollow\">new project</a> aimed at female cotton farmers. \u201cA woman named Roopaben came to our village and started teaching all the women about different methods for farming. She taught us to use less chemical fertiliser because it was bad for the crop. She taught us to tie a cloth around our faces and use gloves on our hands when spraying the fertiliser. She taught us that we didn\u2019t need to flood the entire field to grow cotton, and that too much water could even spoil the crop,\u201d Laktaria says. <br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9da08c61ceffc5b915cee02be40f6c1b5d06bf8c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9da08c61ceffc5b915cee02be40f6c1b5d06bf8c/0_0_5760_3840/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Hetalbai Laktaria\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Hetalbai Laktaria.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: CottonConnect</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In drought-prone Gujarat, the conventional wisdom is that more water means more crop. Laktaria went home that evening and told her husband what she\u2019d learned at the training camp. For Laktaria, who had dropped out of school at 13, and married at 19, her knowledge about cotton farming heightened her status in the family. \u201cMy husband listened to me and we tried the things they taught us,\u201d she says.</p> <p>The new techniques worked. Laktaria\u2019s farms produced 300kg more cotton than the previous year. \u201cWe earned enough money that we could move out of the family home and build our own. We bought a fridge, and we had enough to pay for our two kids\u2019 education. We saved some money for our daughter\u2019s marriage.

The camps are run by a social enterprise called CottonConnect and supported financially by Primark. </p> <p>Although Primark does not have a figure for how much cotton it buys, it is the most common fabric in its clothes. The budget fast-fashion retailer has been criticised for profiting from cheap fashion in developed nations by sourcing from clothing suppliers in poorer parts of the world, where unethical or exploitative labour practices are much harder to regulate. </p> <p>In 2013, Primark was one of many high-street fashion brands criticised for the horrific labour practices in garment factories from which they sourced in Bangladesh, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/18/rana-plaza-collapse-murder-charges-garment-factory\">where 1,135 factory workers died</a> after the collapse of the Rana Plaza complex. </p> <p>India is the <a href=\"https://www.cottonyearbook.com/featured_stories/indias-growing-role-in-the-world-textiles-industry/\" rel=\"nofollow\">world\u2019s second largest producer of cotton</a> after China. The majority of the world\u2019s 100 million cotton farmers are smallholders in developing countries, says Orsola de Castro, founder and director of ethical fashion campaign group Fashion Revolution, and, far away from the shiny stores of brands like Primark, the industry can be brutal for farmers who face competition from unfair world prices and unscrupulous middle men.</p> <p>\u201cMany farmers find themselves caught in a vicious cycle of debt and poverty,\u201d she adds. \u201cFor farmers, the challenges range from the impact of climate change, poor prices for seed cotton, through to competition from highly subsidised producers in rich countries and poor terms of trade. In particular, government subsidies for cotton farmers in rich countries, particularly the US, create a market with artificially low prices in which small-scale farmers are unable to compete.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jun/23/rana-plaza-factory-disaster-bangladesh-primark\">Bangladeshi factory deaths spark action among high-street clothing chains</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Primark\u2019s involvement in the Ranmalpur programme is part of the company\u2019s efforts to improve ethical standards in the retail brand\u2019s \u00a319bn business, which sources most of its garments from developing countries. Already 1,251 women have participated in the retailer\u2019s schemes, which include yield-increasing programmes and healthcare drives. Primark hopes to increase that figure to 10,000 in the next six years. <br></p> <p>A spokesperson said, \u201cAlthough Primark buys no cotton direct from producers, our long-term ambition is to ensure all the cotton in our supply chain is sourced sustainably.\u201d</p> <p>But what about the low-cost retailer\u2019s own influence on low prices? The company argues that buying Fairtrade cotton or paying farmers more is not a suitable strategy for them \u2013 although a statement on its website refers to a plan to sell Fairtrade in the future <a href=\"https://www.primark.com/en/our-ethics/resources-for-students-and-teachers/faqs\" rel=\"nofollow\">\u201cdepending on market demand\u201d</a>. </p> <p>Rock-bottom cotton prices are a major issue, says Subindu Garkhel, cotton product manager at Faitrade, but \u201cit\u2019s not just one company or a few that have this problem, it\u2019s part of the climate of pricing at the moment\u201d. She says it\u2019s a good sign that Primark has started doing something, as it sets an example for brands that are making no commitment on cotton, but warns \u201cjust doing one project is not a solution.\u201d</p> <p>The scheme has not been audited but according to Alison Ward, CEO of CottonConnect, its interventions have increased average yield by at least 10% and increased profit per household by \u00a31,819 on average over two years. \u201cIts been great for the women. On one of my visits, a woman told me that her husband wasn\u2019t initially very keen on her participating.

  "<p>It is less than 18 months since Ed Balls <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/28/ed-balls-labour-minister-memoir\">was one of the big beasts</a> of British politics. Yet how long ago that era seems when one reads his agonised account of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/may/08/election-2015-panel\">the May 2015 election </a>in his memoir, Speaking Out. As a Financial Times reviewer <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/3241b5a4-800b-11e6-8e50-8ec15fb462f4.html#axzz4LexXidV3\">pungently put it</a>, the Balls generation already \u201creeks of yesterday.\u201d</p> <p>Labour lost last year, Balls writes, because it was not sufficiently trusted on the economy, and because Ed Miliband was not credible enough as a potential prime minister. This is what most politicians, as well as most political scientists, election analysts and commentators, myself included, believed at the time and believe now.</p> <p>Yet Jeremy Corbyn <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/sep/28/jeremy-corbyn-speech-labour-conference-jeremy-corbyns-today-interview\">spoke to the Labour party conference this week</a> as if such things simply did not matter to Labour any more. Buoyed by his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/24/labour-leadership-jeremy-corbyn-wins-landslide-victory-party\">emphatic re-election</a> and by the surge of activism in his party, he produced a 21st-century socialist wishlist of policies that flew in the face of the collective common sense of modern politics. Credible economic management? That\u2019s old thinking now. People want hope of change. Competent leadership? It\u2019s the message not the messenger that matters.</p> <p>Although Corbyn talked <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2016/sep/28/jeremy-corbyns-labour-conference-speech-video-highlights\">about the importance of elections</a>, it is abundantly clear that he wants nothing to do with winning on the centre ground in ways that earlier generations on left and right regarded as inescapable. Economic management and competent leadership were always the lodestars of that approach, though not the only tests of centre ground appeal. By these yardsticks, Labour lost in 2015 because the Tories were preferred as best party for the economy by an 18-point margin and because David Cameron was preferred to Miliband as prime minister by 17 points.</p> <p>It is hardly surprising that Corbyn does not want to be judged in the same way. How could he, when his ratings are so poor? The Tories remain 17 points ahead of Labour on the economy. Meanwhile Corbyn trails Theresa May by a<a href=\"https://www.ipsos-mori.com/researchpublications/researcharchive/88/Political-Monitor-Satisfaction-Ratings-1997Present.aspx\">n eye-watering 58 points</a> on net satisfaction. Labour may not be living in la-la land, as the Daily Mail claimed this week, but it is certainly engaged in an attempt to substitute a new political reality for the old one.</p> <p>The problem for Labour is that the centre ground hasn\u2019t gone away. When offered a choice of left, centre-left, centre, centre-right or right, 45% of all British voters in <a href=\"http://opinium.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Dead-Centre-British-politics4_lr.pdf\">an Opinium survey</a> still regard themselves as being in the very centre of the political spectrum. A huge 77% of the British public see themselves either as centrists or centre-left or centre-right. Only 19% see Corbyn as being in the same territory, compared with 46% for Balls and 49% for Tony Blair.</p> <p>By contrast, May is seen as on or close to the centre ground by 44% of all voters. This is one reason why it might be unwise to fall into the fashionable trap of claiming that the centre-focused politics that stretched from the John Major era to that of Cameron is either phoney or finished.</p> <p>Labour has undoubtedly moved on. But those who think that May represents something equivalent on the Tory side of the aisle misread what is happening. The change in the Tory party since the summer is not a retreat from centrism. It may be better understood simply as a recasting, a less metropolitan liberal and more hard-edged version of centrism.</p> <p>May exhibits no sign whatever of being willing to leave the centre untended, as Corbyn does. Just because she has put some very rightwing people <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jul/13/who-theresa-may-cabinet-boris-hammond-rudd\">in her cabinet</a>, or because she has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/09/the-guardian-view-on-theresa-mays-schools-speech-a-divisive-blueprint\">reopened the question of selection in schools</a>, or because she is tasked with implementing Brexit, it does not follow that May is the mirror image of Corbyn.</p> <p>Next week\u2019s Conservative conference will be a test for her. She is adamant she is not abandoning the centre ground. But she does think that she is fashioning a more modern, more post-liberal, more Brexit-aware version of it.</p> <p>The centre is always mobile. Today we live in more economically fragile times than in the Blair years. Those who are \u201cjust managing\u201d, and who May has pledged to support, have a tougher time and fewer expectations than their equivalents a generation ago. Politics is viewed with more mistrust, seen as having failed to control widening inequality and unfairness. And immigration, real and imagined, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/may/26/immigration-england-ons-migration-london-eu-referendum\">has hardened attitudes</a>.</p> <p>In any case, centrist politics was never as technocratic as its enemies pretend. In the 1960s, Harold Wilson did not just promote economic stewardship and effective leadership. He invoked flag and family, and cultivated an image of domestic, pipe-smoking ordinariness that was at odds with his well-hidden taste for cigars and brandy. In the present day, what is the SNP in Scotland but centrist government wrapped in a mastery of the symbolic and the rhetorical?</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/29/jeremy-corbyn-critics-must-decide-unity-or-terminal-decline\">Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s critics must decide: unity or terminal decline | Owen Jones</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The Blair-Balls-Cameron generations were much less good at this. Blair in particular had a blind spot, which became a hostility, to the public\u2019s attachments and in particular to the public\u2019s fear of change. Though the public admired his competence as a domestic leader, they never bought into his embrace of change for change\u2019s sake, his love of the new and disruptive, his indifference to tradition.</p> <p>Though much has changed in the world, good management of the economy and competent leadership remain the essentials of any election-winning strategy. But a really smart centrist has to master the cultural as well as the technocratic, especially in tough economic times. Corbyn has some grasp of the former but possesses little or none of the latter. May, in her centre-right way, seems to have a much firmer sense of both \u2013 which is probably why she is winning.</p>",

The findings support the notion that comets delivered some necessary ingredients for life to Earth, and also allow scientists to re-imagine exactly which chemicals were being stirred into the mix.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://sci.esa.int/rosetta/35061-instruments/?fbodylongid=1650\">Rosina instrument</a>, a mass spectrometer on board Rosetta, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2016/may/27/comet-67p-atmospehere-contains-chemicals-of-life-rosetta-mission-glycine\">detected the amino acid glycine</a>, as well as the chemicals from which it is formed, methylamine and ethylamine. It also found phosphorus, a key component of DNA. </p> <p>\u201cThis is what must have been in the primordial soup,\u201d said Schwehm.</p> <p>Schwehm, who has worked on the mission since its inception, said ESA\u2019s original plan had been to bring comet samples back to Earth, but this was eventually deemed too expensive and risky. \u201cWe decided if we could not get the comet to the laboratory, we\u2019d get the laboratory to the comet,\u201d he said. \u201cSurprisingly, it worked.\u201d</p> <p>The mission has not been without hair-raising moments for those involved.</p> <p>For Accomazzo, nerves peaked when Rosetta\u2019s internal hardware tripped and rebooted as it came out of a three-year period in hibernation mode in early 2014, causing a 15-minute delay in scientists receiving the craft\u2019s \u201cphone home\u201d confirmation that it was still alive. Despite knowing that all the technical groundwork had been laid, he admits thinking: \u201cThis is crazy, how can this thing fly for three years on its own through space?\u201d</p> <p>For Grady, the highlight was the Philae landing, in November 2014, when <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-30022765\">footage of the eminent space scientist</a> whooping and eventually weeping with joy went viral on Twitter. Aside from the birth of her son, she admits, \u201cnothing is ever going to top that\u201d.</p> <p>After the initial celebrations, mission scientists later realised that Philae had bounced across the surface before coming to land in a shady spot beneath a cliff. Philae\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2014/nov/14/rosetta-philae-lander-hop-comet\">batteries drained within a couple of days</a> and, after briefly <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2015/jun/14/rosetta-mission-hibernating-philae-lander-spacecraft-wakes-up\">waking up again</a> a couple of times as the comet approached the sun, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2016/feb/12/farewell-philae-rosetta-probe-goes-into-eternal-hibernation-comet-67p-churyumov-gerasimenko\">it was never heard from again</a>. </p> <p>Despite things not going entirely to plan, Grady estimates that Philae still carried out 80-85% of the work it was scheduled to do. And in a moment that mission scientists described as \u201cemotional closure\u201d, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2016/sep/05/lost-philae-lander-found-as-rosetta-mission-draws-to-a-close-comet-67p\">Rosetta finally managed to spot</a> the washing machine-sized lander on the surface earlier this month.</p> <p>As dust settles on the Rosetta craft \u2013 assuming the landing goes to plan \u2013 mission scientists are holding a celebratory barbecue to avoid things getting too maudlin. </p> <p>\u201cIt will be very sad\u201d, Grady said. \u201cIt\u2019s been a big part of our lives for such a long time.\u201d she adds. \u201cIn six years, the comet will be back again. We won\u2019t be able to speak to it, but you\u2019ll be able to look up and know Rosetta\u2019s a bit closer to us.\u201d</p> <p>Professor Mark McCaughrean, the senior science advisor at the ESA, told BBC Radio 4 it was a sad day as he reflected on what the Rosetta mission had achieved</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s giving us a real insight into the building blocks of the solar system and the material which could have formed life on the earth, not life itself but the raw building blocks,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cBut more importantly for me, it\u2019s engaged the public in a way which is just unparalleled for a robotics space mission. The enthusiasm I see on the faces of kids around the world when I give talks and the public following online it\u2019s going to be very sad day but a very proud day for everyone that\u2019s been involved.\u201d </p>",

I kept listening in the hope I\u2019d hear it, that she would reach out and hook me and reel me in through the simple articulation of her moment in history. But there was no clear pitch \u2013 apart from I\u2019m not the lunatic.</p> <p>I get why the primary season in the US is about conversations in-house \u2013 obviously candidates are seeking the endorsement of their tribe \u2013 but once that\u2019s done I expected a kind of broadening. I\u2019d expected some kind of inclusive appeal to Trump supporters, given the white working-class vote should not be an entirely lost cause for the Democratic party, at least not post-global financial crisis.</p> <p>I\u2019d expected she would talk to them about the faux everyman they were thinking of backing for the White House, and she did, a little bit, but mainly she spoke to her supporters in staccato winks. The critique of Trump was genial and roundabout, as if we all got the joke, as if the target audience was the editorial board of the New York Times, not the people casting their votes in November who would never even think to buy a copy.</p> <p>She was passive in her orderliness. Clinton presented to the voting public with a modest kind of righteousness, as if that was the required benchmark, rather than brute, cut-through persuasiveness \u2013 a sanguine disposition which seemed premature, given the gruelling contest is only now entering the decisive phase.</p> <p>As for Trump, it was more of his shtick: he was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/26/debate-fact-check-trump-clinton-live-quotes-hofstra\">defiantly post-fact, post-ideology, post-coherence</a> \u2013 stroking his angry, alienated tribe, the people he has spent months courting and comforting with his authoritarian tendencies, framing himself as the last living saviour of the white working man of a certain age oppressed by globalisation, by mouthy women, by the \u201cother\u201d of the moment \u2013 Mexicans \u2013 by the Chinese.</p> <p>Trump has reeled his tribe in by pretending to understand them, by pretending to stand with them against the establishment cliche that is Hillary Clinton. That\u2019s his brand of self-satisfied righteousness, the cynically constructed comic strip that is \u201cDonald, professional underdog\u201d, a nonsense he delivers with brittle conviction, aided and abetted by the echo chamber on Fox News, a rolling cacophony of bobble heads high on imagined liberal conspiracy.</p> <p>Trump\u2019s central pitch was easier to identify, but he made absolutely no effort to engineer some kind of crossover conversation. There was no broadening his appeal, no toning it down, no presidential affect, no pitch to the swinging centre.</p> <p>An audience of millions erupted on social media in howls of acclamation and derision, like there was nothing more at stake than a thumbs up or thumbs down emoji. Feelings were brittle. Commentary was scornful and punishing, a mass study in confirmation bias.</p> <p>Increasingly, this is politics.

Turnbull is trying to keep his fractious troops together when in practice the Coalition in 2016 is a conservative party with Hansonesque leanings and a centrist liberal party.</p> <p>Most days, in abundant ways, we see how hard it is to synthesise those differences. In attempting to rally and bind his troops, perhaps our individualist prime minister has become a tribalist, after all.</p> <p>Bubbles really can\u2019t be avoided in modern politics. Depressingly, it is the way of things. The prime minister has to develop the trick of subsistence in the bubble, but he also has to puncture it, forcefully when necessary, both to avoid slow suffocation and as a gesture of recognition \u2013 because outside the cloisters the Australian people are watching and hoping that someone in major party politics can rise above the aggressive insularity and the brinkmanship, give them the courtesy of a genuine conversation, and face up to the challenges of the moment.</p>",

Simpering remarks from his hate rallies about \u201cthe good old days\u201d are set against classic images from <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/dec/28/usa-barack-obama-race\">Little Rock</a> as well as violence towards minority protesters by his acolytes. These scenes make 13th one of the most effective horror movies in years. Lucky, then, that the film is being released on Netflix, as viewers may need to hit pause and find a bucket into which to vomit.</p> <p>Not every talking point snaps together so nicely, though. A stretch explaining the curious corporate/lawmaker glad-handing club Alec (American Legislative Exchange Council), while certainly alarming, begins to stink a bit of dorm-room weed. I remain unconvinced that Walmart, evil on its own terms, really wanted George Zimmerman to gun down <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jul/14/trayvon-martin-george-zimmerman-trial\">Trayvon Martin</a>, even if its business model does capitalise on <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/28/stand-your-ground-florida-police-shooting-jermaine-mcbean-peter-peraza\">stand your ground</a> laws.</p> <p>A few small hiccups aside, 13th is very much not a Michael Moore film. It is organised, detailed and powerful. It is also bleak as hell, and, unfortunately, does not conclude with advice on what to do next. I think, though, the first step is obvious: clear one hour and 40 minutes of your time, turn off your damn phone, watch this movie, then tell others to do so. It\u2019s a start.</p>"
