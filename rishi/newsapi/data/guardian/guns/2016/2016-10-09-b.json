  "<p>Internet users who post derogatory hashtags or humiliating Photoshopped images could face prosecution under new legal guidelines. <br></p> <p>But sexting \u2013 exchanging sexualised images \u2013 between those aged under 18 should not normally become the subject of a police investigation if it involves children of a similar age in a relationship, the Crown Prosecution Service has recommended.</p> <p>The public consultation on updated guidance for lawyers about when antisocial internet use tips over into illegal activity is published at the start of Hate Crime Awareness Week to help prosecutors decide when to act. It follows a Childnet <a href=\"http://(https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/feb/09/internet-trolling-teenagers-online-abuse-hate-cyberbullying\">report</a>  this year that found one in four teenagers suffered abuse online from trolling because of their gender, sexual orientation, race, religion, disability or transgender identity.</p> <p>The CPS\u2019s social media guidelines also cover attacks on disabled people, violence against women and girls, and racial and religious, homophobic and transphobic hate crime. Their publication will stimulate debate about the limits of free speech online and may help develop a clearer consensus about what is acceptable behaviour.</p> <p>As well as \u201cvirtual mobbing\u201d and \u201cdog-piling\u201d which incite hatred, other forms of online harassment that the CPS believes can amount to criminal activity are encouraging the retweeting of grossly offensive messages, \u201cdoxxing\u201d \u2013 publishing personal information such as home address or bank details \u2013 or devising derogatory hashtags to target victims.</p> <p>Perpetrators who participate in or initiate hate campaigns may be charged with encouraging an offence under the Serious Crime Act 2007, the new guidelines suggest.</p> <p>Sexting cases, the CPS acknowledges, need to be carefully assessed particularly when they involve children. \u201cWhile it would not usually be in the public interest to prosecute consensual sharing of an image between two children of a similar age in a relationship, a prosecution may be appropriate in other scenarios, such as those involving exploitation, grooming or bullying,\u201d it is proposed.</p> <p>In more serious cases, the guidelines say, consideration may be given to the offence of causing or inciting a child to engage in sexual activity under the Sexual Offences Act 2003. Other practices that may be considered illegal are \u201cbaiting\u201d \u2013 humiliating someone by labelling them as sexually promiscuous or posting Photoshopped images to disparage victims.</p> <p>\u201cSocial media can be used to educate, entertain and enlighten but there are also people who use it to bully, intimidate and harass,\u201d Alison Saunders, the director of public prosecutions, said. \u201cIgnorance is not a defence and perceived anonymity is not an escape. Those who commit these acts, or encourage others to do the same, can and will be prosecuted.\u201d</p> <p>The DPP added: \u201cWe welcome the comments and opinions of communities and those affected by hate crimes to help us inform the way we deal with such cases in the future. Our latest hate crime report showed that in 2015-16 more hate crime prosecutions were completed than ever before.</p> <p>\u201cMore than four in five prosecuted hate crimes result in a conviction, with over 73% guilty pleas, which is good news for victims. We have undertaken considerable steps to improve our prosecution of hate crime and we are committed to sustaining these efforts.\u201d</p> <p>There was a large <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/sep/07/hate-surged-after-eu-referendum-police-figures-show\">reported rise in racial hate crimes in the aftermath of the EU referendum</a>. Police forces have also complained about the growing burden of cybercrime investigations.</p> <p>Prosecutors are reminded in the guidelines that the threshold for legal action under the Malicious Communications Act 1988 and the Communications Act 2003 is the sending of a communication that is deemed grossly offensive.</p> <p>It adds: \u201cA communication sent has to be more than simply offensive to be contrary to the criminal law.\u201d Messages that are merely satirical, iconoclastic, rude or involve expressions of unpopular or unfashionable opinion will not constitute a criminal offence.</p> <p>Consultation on the CPS guidelines opens on Monday and lasts for 13 weeks. The CPS, created in 1986, is celebrating its 30th anniversary this month.</p> <h2>Internet terminology</h2> <ul> <li><strong>Virtual mobbing</strong> or <strong>dog-piling</strong>: encouraging social media users to harass individuals.<br></li> <li><strong>Doxxing</strong>: publishing personal information such as home address or bank details.<br></li> <li><strong>Trolling</strong>: inciting hatred by posting abusive or inflammatory messages.<br></li> <li><strong>Baiting</strong>: humiliating someone by accusing them of being sexually promiscuous. <br></li> <li><strong>Sexting</strong>: sending sexually explicit messages, usually from one phone user to another.<br></li> <li><strong>Cyberstalking</strong>: threatening behaviour or unwanted approaches.<br></li> <li><strong>Spamming</strong>: directing vast quantities of unwanted messages at a victim.<br></li> <li><strong>Flaming</strong>: subjecting users to abuse often in live chat forums.<br></li> </ul>",
  "<p>Universities should make greater efforts to spot talent among disadvantaged students and place special emphasis on encouraging white working-class men in order to widen access to higher education, according to a new report backed by British universities.</p> <p>The report \u2013 produced by the sector at the request of the government \u2013 found that \u201csocio-economic disadvantage has more persistent and far-reaching impact on access to and outcomes from higher education\u201d than any other single cause.</p> <p>But the study by <a href=\"http://www.universitiesuk.ac.uk/policy-and-analysis/Pages/inclusion-equality-diversity.aspx\">Universities UK\u2019s social mobility action group</a> offered few concrete suggestions on how to overcome the effects of disadvantage, and instead called for further data collection, analysis and sharing of best practice between institutions.</p> <p>Nicola Dandridge, the chief executive of Universities UK who chaired the advisory group, said: \u201cThe evidence provides a stark reminder of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/mar/12/uk-education-reforms-not-helped-social-mobility\">work that still needs to be done to improve social mobility</a>.

  "<p>Another win in the books, Tom Brady jogged off the field as he\u2019s done so many times before.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/oct/09/nfl-wrap-vikings-unbeaten-lions-eagles\">NFL wrap: Vikings stay unbeaten and Lions hand Eagles first loss of the season</a> </p> </aside>  <p>As the Patriots fans who invaded Cleveland cheered and chanted his name, Brady waved and smiled before heading into the locker room and celebrating with his team-mates.</p> <p>His eyes only focused forward, he savored every second.</p> <p>He missed this.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m back doing what I love to do,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Looking razor-sharp at times and relatively rust-free after serving his four-game Deflategate suspension, Brady passed for 406 yards and threw three touchdowns to Martellus Bennett in his hyped return as the Patriots thumped the Cleveland Browns 33-13 on Sunday.</p> <p>New England\u2019s star quarterback was back much to the relief of teammates and Patriots fans everywhere following a ban for his role in the scandal in which an NFL investigation found that the four-time Super Bowl champion Patriots under-inflated footballs in the 2015 AFC championship game.</p> <p>Brady fought Commissioner Roger Goodell\u2019s ruling for more than a year before he begrudgingly accepted his punishment.</p> <p>And while it appeared he took out some frustration on the Browns (0-5), Brady insisted he\u2019s not seeking revenge.</p> <p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t a time for me to reflect,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s no point at looking back at anything. Whether we won Super Bowls or lost championship games or the last four weeks, none of it matters. I\u2019ve just moved on, man.\u201d </p> <p>Brady passed for 271 yards in the first half as the Patriots (4-1) rebounded from a stinging shutout last week at home to Buffalo. Brady threw two short TD passes in the first half to Bennett before hooking up with his new teammate on a 37-yarder to give the Patriots a 30-7 lead in the third.</p> <p>He thoroughly enjoyed his return, even posing like Olympic track star Usain Bolt after a four-yard run to signal for a first down. \u201cI don\u2019t run much, and when I do I get excited,\u201d he said, smiling.</p> <p>Coach Bill Belichick replaced Brady with 6:02 left, greeting him on the sideline with a handshake and pat on the back.</p> <p>The 39-year-old was far from perfect, overthrowing Julian Edelman for a possible long TD, but Brady spread the ball around and showed a nice touch on a few passes, including a floater to Rob Gronkowski for 37 yards in the fourth.</p> <p>\u201cWe hadn\u2019t seen him in a while,\u201d said Edelman, Brady\u2019s team-mate for eight seasons who was not surprised by the performance. \u201cYou train with a guy. You go to camp with a guy. You\u2019ve played a number of years with a guy. To see what he\u2019s gone through, you\u2019re going to get excited.\u201d</p> <p>Following the game, Brady basked in the adulation from the Patriots fans ringing the entrance to the tunnel, Following his news conference, Brady stylish as always in a blue tailored suit, posed for a few photos with fans before he was greeted by friends, including former Browns tight end Aaron Shea, who threw his arms around his Michigan teammate.</p> <p>LeGarrette Blount added a 1-yard score for the Patriots, who all drew inspiration from Brady\u2019s return.</p> <p>\u201cWe were all intense today, all amped up,\u201d said Gronkowski, who had five catches for 109 yards. \u201cTom always brings the ampness to the table.\u201d</p> <p>Unfortunately for the Browns, a rebuilding season is spiraling out of control. Cleveland has dropped seven straight and 14 of 15, and Browns coach Hue Jackson is running out of quarterbacks after rookie Cody Kessler was knocked out in the first half with rib and chest injuries. Charlie Whitehurst replaced him, becoming the fifth quarterback to play for Cleveland in five games.</p> <p>When Brady ran on to the field for New England\u2019s first play, thousands of fans, many wearing his No12 jersey, cheered.</p> <p>At that moment, all was right again from Cambridge to Maine\u2019s coastline.</p> <p>Brady completed his first pass to his favorite target, Edelman, and connected twice on New England\u2019s opening drive with Gronkowski, who sidestepped a couple of tacklers and looked like the indomitable Gronk while bulling his way to the Cleveland one.</p> <p>It was a new beginning, a fresh start for Brady, who found comfort after so many months of angst. \u201cIt was fun to come out and play and fun to win,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s the most important thing.\u201d</p>",

  "<p>The Republic of Ireland\u2019s chances of qualifying for Russia in 2018 are looking rosier after they overcame a mid-match wobble in Moldova to record an eventually comfortable victory, thanks to James McClean\u2019s two second-half goals.</p> <p>It was a win that Martin O\u2019Neill\u2019s side always deserved, and Irish spirits will have been further boosted by Wales dropping points at home to Georgia earlier in the evening, which leaves the Republic second in Group D. However, the manner in which they lost their way and conceded a sloppy equaliser shortly before half-time will concern the Republic\u2019s manager.</p> <p>Their captain, S\u00e9amus Coleman, admitted as much. \u201cJust before half-time we were very naive to be left isolated at the back like we were,\u201d said the defender. \u201cWe should have just come in at half-time one nil up, but we didn\u2019t and we made it hard work, and I thought we were very sloppy at times with flicks and kicks in the first half but we got it right in the second half.\u201d</p> <p>Ireland were without the suspended Jeff Hendrick and the injured Robbie Brady but gave Wes Hoolahan a start and the Norwich playmaker proved his worth by setting up the opening goal after four minutes. He released Shane Long with a superb first-time pass from just past the halfway line for the Southampton striker to tuck it confidently away with his right foot, low into the corner past the advancing goalkeeper, Nicolae Calancea, for his first goal in 18 matches.</p> <p>They may not have been up against testing opposition but there was a fluency to Ireland\u2019s football that was largely absent three days earlier against Georgia. Hoolahan, always on the lookout for an incisive pass, was prominent in most Irish attacks, while Coleman on the right and McClean and Stephen Ward on the left frequently stretched the home defence.</p> <p>Ireland had chances to extend their lead when McClean fired wide first-time on the half-volley and when Coleman advanced skilfully to the byline and crossed for Long six yards out but his header was blocked by Vitalie Bordian.</p> <p>Moldova looked stretched, already reliant on the counterattack and balls forward for their wide men to chase, but the sole striker Igor Bugaev cut a lonely figure.</p> <p>The Moldova right-back, Igor Arnas, needed treatment to his right leg after a 50-50 challenge with Long and was carried off and replaced by Victor Golovatenco.</p> <p>Chances began to dry up, as Moldova ended the half with their best spell of the match. The visitors were punished just before half-time when Bugaev got goalside of the Irish back four on a breakaway, racing clear of the badly out of position Shane Duffy from halfway and finishing smartly past Darren Randolph from just inside the area.</p> <p>Moldova looked sprightly at the start of the second half, too, Alexandru Dedov testing Randolph with a firm rising drive. O\u2019Neill\u2019s side now found themselves struggling to find the space and movement they had enjoyed in the opening stages, with passes going astray and Coleman receiving a yellow card for a foul on Dedov after being dispossessed.</p> <p>But the longer the half progressed, the more Moldova sat back and they were punished on 69 minutes when a hopeful shot from James McCarthy was controlled on the six-yard line by Jon Walters, who laid it back for McClean to send a firm shot low to the keeper\u2019s left-hand corner.</p> <p>McClean made sure seven minutes later, finishing a stylish move started by Hoolahan, whose close control on the right touchline created space for a pass to Coleman whose first-time delivery was volleyed in from close range.</p> <p>Moldova\u2019s discipline began to desert them, Andrei Cojacari going in the book for an ugly hack at McClean. Tempers also boiled over in the final minute when Walters reacted badly to a foul from Dedov and earned a booking for dissent, after O\u2019Neill had rushed on to the pitch to calm the winger down. But it was only a minor blemish on a satisfying evening.</p>",

Buttler could face ICC sanction after the umpires had to step in as the Bangladesh fielders \u2013 led by Mahmudullah, who earlier scored 75 \u2013 goaded him on the way off the field.</p> <p>\u201cI was just a little bit disappointed in the fashion they celebrated,\u201d Buttler said. \u201cRightly they are happy to get a wicket but there is no need to run in someone\u2019s face and celebrate. I\u2019m disappointed to get out, the emotions were high but that happens.\u201d</p> <p>When asked if this was the first time he had lost his rag when playing for England, Buttler said: \u201cMaybe you don\u2019t know me as well as you think you do,\u201d but he did admit that, if he had his time again, \u201cmaybe in hindsight I could just walk away but it is what it is\u201d.</p> <p>While Buttler said it was the first bit of niggle he had noticed in the game, the trouble did not end when Bangladesh sealed their win, with Tamim Iqbal appearing to refuse England\u2019s handshakes and Ben Stokes rebuking the Bangladesh opener for his actions. \u201cObviously emotions run high, and Ben is an emotional guy but he would not have reacted like that if nothing had happened,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Buttler is standing in for Eoin Morgan, who along with the opener Alex Hales pulled out of the tour of Bangladesh for security reasons. He admitted he had witnessed the full scale of emotions in his two matches in charge. England won the first, on Friday night, by 21 runs with a remarkable fightback as Bangladesh lost six for 18.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s certainly much more emotional as captain,\u201d he said. \u201cYou try to react the right way, but it\u2019s something I will learn if I do it much more. It\u2019s something I will try to improve on, trying to keep levelheaded, not letting emotions get too high or too low.\u201d</p> <p>With a partisan, 25,000-strong crowd behind them, Buttler also said he was unsurprised by Bangladesh\u2019s aggression. \u201cIt\u2019s obviously a very passionate cricket country and the players are very passionate,\u201d he said. The Bangladesh captain, Mashrafe Mortaza, who was the man of the match for scoring 44 and taking four for 29, put Buttler\u2019s angry reaction down to \u201cthe heat of the moment\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know who spoke to Buttler,\u201d he said. \u201cI was focusing on the review that I took and then I got excited by the decision. Sometimes a lot of things happen in the heat of the moment. But players from both sides should control themselves.\u201d</p> <p>Buttler expects the high emotion to continue in the final match in Chittagong, which takes place on a pitch that is expected to spin more and to make the toss of vital importance. The two-Test series begins on 20 October. \u201cThe characters we have in our side, we have some very feisty guys who want to win,\u201d Buttler said. \u201cThere\u2019s a line we have to stick to but I still want us to be positive and trying to attack and win the game.\u201d</p>",

But you asked me about her position on trade and her position on trade is very clear.\u201d</p> <p>Clinton\u2019s campaign manager, Robby Mook, similarly struggled to answer questions about the purported excerpts, including a 2013 speech to Goldman Sachs bankers which discussed Clinton having a separate \u201cpublic and a private position\u201d. </p> <p>\u201cIf everybody\u2019s watching, you know, all of the backroom discussions and the deals, you know, then people get a little nervous to say the least,\u201d Clinton told the bankers, according to the excerpt. \u201cSo you need a public and a private position.\u201d </p> <p>Mook told CBS: \u201cI think there\u2019s a distinction between what goes on in negotiations and what her positions are on the issues and have been on the issues.\u201d</p> <p>He tried to argue that Clinton had fought for financial regulation before the crisis and recession. </p> <p>\u201cHillary Clinton went to the floor of the Nasdaq in 2008 and said that these swaps and derivatives, and what was going on with the mortgage lending market, was wrong and was going to crash the economy,\u201d Mook said. \u201cShe\u2019s called for closing the interest loophole for some time now.</p> <p>\u201cHer public position and what she\u2019s going to fight for as president for are one and the same.\u201d</p> <p>Clinton did deliver a speech in <a href=\"http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=77069\">March 2007</a>, in the early weeks of the financial crisis, blaming mortgage industry practices and recommending a few reforms. She mentioned derivatives and further reform in <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2007/POLITICS/12/21/clinton.trans.economy/\">November</a> that year and on the campaign trail <a href=\"http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=96569\">in 2008</a>, well into the crisis.</p> <p>Years later, however, Clinton told her Goldman Sachs audience it was \u201can oversimplification\u201d to blame \u201cour banking system causing this everywhere\u201d, the email excerpts show. </p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s a lot that could have been avoided in terms of both misunderstanding and really politicizing what happened,\u201d she said in a 2013 speech, according to the leaked excerpts, \u201cwith greater transparency, with greater openness on all sides, you know, what happened, how did it happen, how do we prevent it from happening? </p> <p>\u201cYou guys help us figure it out and let\u2019s make sure we do it right this time.\u201d</p> <p>Throughout the Democratic primary, Clinton was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/11/bernie-sanders-hillary-clinton-democratic-platform-negotiations\">accused of an overly comfortable relationship with Wall Street</a> by her rival on the left, Bernie Sanders. He also mocked her for her refusal to release the text of the private speeches, saying: \u201cI kind of think if you\u2019re going to be paid $225,000 for a speech, it must be a fantastic speech.\u201d</p> <p>On Saturday, Sanders reaffirmed his support for Clinton, saying: \u201cWhatever Secretary Clinton may or may not have said behind closed doors on Wall Street, I am determined to implement the agenda of the Democratic party platform, which was agreed to by her campaign.\u201d</p> <p>Clinton\u2019s campaign chairman, John Podesta, insisted that the excerpts had been taken out of context. \u201cThere is nothing that she has said in private that she doesn\u2019t say in public,\u201d he told Fox News Sunday.</p> <p>\u201cShe has said all throughout this campaign that she will crack down on Wall Street,\u201d he said. \u201cShe has put forward the most aggressive Wall Street plan of any candidate, really.\u201d</p> <p>Referring to legislation passed in 2010 that took measures to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/jul/19/two-cheers-dodd-frank-act-wall-street-culture-radical-change\">re-regulate</a> Wall Street after the 2008 financial <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/dec/28/markets-credit-crunch-banking-2008\">collapse</a> and recession, he added: \u201cShe stands behind Dodd-Frank, while [Donald] Trump wants to rip it away.</p> <p>\u201cPeople on Wall Street know how to game the system. What she wants to do is crack down on the system, make sure that there is no institution too big to fail and no person that\u2019s too big to jail. That\u2019s why Bernie Sanders yesterday, after looking at those scripts, says that he stands behind her.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/oct/07/us-russia-dnc-hack-interfering-presidential-election\">US officially accuses Russia of hacking DNC and interfering with election</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Although <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/08/john-mccain-donald-trump-sex-boast-tape\">divided by their own candidate</a>, some Republicans seized on the speeches as evidence of Clinton\u2019s penchant for secrecy, in line with her use of a private email server while she was secretary of state. Former New York mayor Rudy Giuliani, one of the top advisers in Trump\u2019s embattled campaign, said the excerpts would have been a deathblow to Clinton had they come out during the Democratic primary.</p> <p>\u201cHad those come out, Bernie Sanders would be the candidate now that we\u2019d be running against, not her. She fought so hard to keep those secret \u2013 we now know why,\u201d he told Fox News Sunday.</p> <p>\u201cShe pointed out in one of them that she is a different person to them [the bankers] than she has to be politically,\u201d he continued. \u201cSo we have two Hillary Clintons, which says we have a person who is a liar. Because that\u2019s what she is. I mean, over and over again.\u201d</p> <p>Giuliani then tried to draw an equivalence between the recently leaked video of Trump <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/09/donald-trump-groping-remarks-sexual-assault-tim-kaine-debate\">bragging about groping women</a> and the hacked emails. Both, he said, were \u201cwrong\u201d. </p> <p>\u201cSo we\u2019ve got two candidates who have flaws,\u201d he said.</p> <p></p> <p><br></p> <p></p> <p></p>",
  "<p>It is a pretty bad joke for the government to offer lifetime voting rights to expatriates at the precise time when its own policy endangers the future of those of us who live elsewhere in the EU (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/07/expats-given-vote-for-life-uk-elections-government-says\" title=\"\">Expats to get voting rights for life</a>, 8&#xa0;October).

  "<p>Britain is seeking to shift the frontline of immigration controls to Ireland\u2019s ports and airports to avoid having to introduce a \u201chard border\u201d between north and south after the UK leaves the European Union, the Guardian has learned.</p> \n<p>The Northern Ireland secretary, James Brokenshire, has told the Guardian that London and Dublin will work to strengthen Ireland\u2019s external borders in order to combat illegal migration into the UK once it leaves the European Union.</p> \n<p>In an interview, Brokenshire said there was now a \u201chigh level of collaboration on a joint programme of work\u201d between the two states to control immigration.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe have put in place a range of measures to further combat illegal migration working closely with the Irish government,\u201d Brokenshire said. \u201cOur focus is to strengthen the external border of the common travel area [CTA], building on the strong collaboration with our Irish partners.\u201d</p> \n<p>The CTA is a unique arrangement that allows for full freedom of movement between people from Ireland and Britain on both islands.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom element--supporting\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"7340c0a7-09a6-4627-b639-349724fb0559\" data-atom-type=\"explainer\"> \n  <div>\n   <figure class=\"element element-explainer element-atom\" data-display-type=\"flat\"> \n    <h1>How will Brexit affect Ireland?</h1> \n    <div>\n     <p>Britain's decision to leave the EU affects Ireland in myriad ways. The fall of sterling has hurt Irish exporters, who sell \u00a315bn of products in Britain every year. There is deep uncertainty over what will happen to the border between Ireland and Northern Ireland after Brexit. Few want a return to a 'hard border' studded with checkpoints, yet fully open British frontiers seem destined to disappear. Ireland has opportunities too, not least that it could attract banks, financial firms and other businesses wary of investing in an isolated UK with an uncertain future.<br></p>\n    </div> \n   </figure> \n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>After Britain\u2019s vote to leave the EU in June, concern mounted that to control immigration, measures would have to be imposed on the 300-mile border between the Irish Republic and Northern Ireland. Any such border controls would probably be seen as a violation of the Good Friday agreement and a provocation in a region that has only relatively recently put violence behind it.<br></p> \n<p>Shifting the onus of immigration control to Irish entry points such as Dublin airport and Rosslare port would avoid this. However, it would also make a mockery of claims by the Brexit camp that leaving the EU would enable Britain to \u201ctake back control of its borders\u201d.</p> \n<p>Brokenshire said: \u201cWe are already working closely with the Irish government and other members of the common travel area to prevent people from seeking to evade UK immigration controls from entering via another part of the CTA. There is a high level of collaboration on a joint programme of work. This includes investment in border procedures; increased data sharing to inform immigration and border security decisions; passenger data systems enabling the collection and processing of advance passenger information; and harmonised visa processes.\u201d</p> \n<p>The measures will be aimed primarily at non-Europeans seeking entry into the CTA. Politicians on all sides of the divide on the island of Ireland have expressed concern that Irish border towns such as Dundalk could become the \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/26/calais-migrant-camp-must-go-by-end-of-year-francois-hollande\">new Calais</a>\u201d if people-traffickers trying to send migrants into the UK target the Irish Republic as a \u201cjump-off point\u201d into Northern Ireland.</p> \n<p>Precedents already exist for this Anglo-Irish collaborative model: Indian and Chinese visitors are subject to a system whereby they apply for a single visa, valid for travel in both Ireland and the UK. </p> \n<p>The joint Anglo-Irish border procedures will not be able to stem the arrival of EU nationals, as they will retain the right to free movement to live and work in the Irish Republic.

  "<p>The British government <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/09/britain-to-push-post-brexit-uk-immigration-controls-back-to-irish-border\">has given its first official hint </a>that it hopes the Irish external border will provide the solution to one of the most vexing conundrums of Brexit: how to pull up the immigration drawbridge without installing a \u201chard border\u201d of customs posts and passport checks between Northern Ireland and Ireland.</p> \n<p>James Brokenshire\u2019s statement that the focus in a post-Brexit world is to \u201cstrengthen the external border of the common travel area\u201d is likely to mean that the only physical passport checks an international traveller will face on his or her way into Britain via Ireland will be at an Irish airport or seaport.</p> \n<p>Asking the Irish to carry out Britain\u2019s passport checks may not be what Brexiters had in mind when they campaigned to \u201ctake back control of Britain\u2019s borders\u201d. Indeed, the chairman of the Vote Leave campaign, the former chancellor Lord Lawson, explicitly called for the return of a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic during the referendum campaign.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom element--supporting\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"7340c0a7-09a6-4627-b639-349724fb0559\" data-atom-type=\"explainer\"> \n  <div>\n   <figure class=\"element element-explainer element-atom\" data-display-type=\"flat\"> \n    <h1>How will Brexit affect Ireland?</h1> \n    <div>\n     <p>Britain's decision to leave the EU affects Ireland in myriad ways. The fall of sterling has hurt Irish exporters, who sell \u00a315bn of products in Britain every year. There is deep uncertainty over what will happen to the border between Ireland and Northern Ireland after Brexit. Few want a return to a 'hard border' studded with checkpoints, yet fully open British frontiers seem destined to disappear. Ireland has opportunities too, not least that it could attract banks, financial firms and other businesses wary of investing in an isolated UK with an uncertain future.<br></p>\n    </div> \n   </figure> \n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>But the development of electronic border systems \u2013 essentially passenger databases \u2013 by both British and Irish governments over the past decade make it possible to operate a digital \u201couter common perimeter\u201d around both countries.<br></p> \n<p>Neither system has been without major problems, but the collection of advanced passenger information at the time of booking and the transmission of passenger name records on international flights has now become routine. The data collection will soon be extended to include all flights within the EU. </p> \n<p>Those databases enable both governments to screen out those barred from entry before they even get on the plane. They mean that a passenger arriving at Dublin airport could face the same digital checks as any arriving at Heathrow.</p> \n<p>As Brokenshire indicates, this process is already under way, with the Irish government recognising UK short-term visitor visas for travel to Ireland for visitors from 16 countries, including India and China. A common short-stay visit visa is also being pursued. </p> \n<p>In March, Ireland passed legislation allowing the UK to require airlines and ferry companies to provide advance passenger details on all UK-Irish journeys. The Northern Ireland secretary is making clear this work will accelerate and the existing Operation Gull to tackle illegal migration to Northern Ireland expanded to close any potential backdoor to Britain post-Brexit.<br></p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>Only a relatively small number of EU citizens would want to come to the UK illegally</p> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>As the Irish ambassador to Britain, Dan Mulhall, recently told the House of Lords: \u201cFor as long as Ireland is not part of Schengen, everyone coming into Ireland from continental Europe and beyond has to go through passport control at our airports and ports. Therefore, the only people who will have the right of free movement into Ireland and the right to live, work, visit and settle in Ireland will be European Union citizens.<br></p> \n<p>\u201cIt is, of course, true that an EU citizen could come to Ireland after Brexit, settle in Ireland and then decide to go across the border to Northern Ireland and then to Britain, but they would be illegal immigrants. As I understand, most Europeans are not interested in being illegal in any European country \u2026 It seems to me that only a relatively small number of European Union citizens would want to come to the UK illegally.\u201d</p> \n<p>Mulhall said in the \u201cworst-case scenario\u201d that the UK government decided to curb freedom of movement to prevent all other EU citizens living and working in Britain, the Irish border would not pose an additional risk. All EU citizens would presumably still have the right to enter and visit Britain and pass any external passport control, so any future work permit system would likely be enforced with internal checks by employers through a registration, national insurance or identity card system.<br></p> \n<p>Customs checks are a different issue, but academics say they could operate on the same lines as those between Norway and Sweden where mobile spot checks don\u2019t necessarily take place at the physical border.</p>",
  "<p>This was the day when the path to the World Cup finals in Russia started to become more complicated for Wales. Chris Coleman and his players need no telling there is little margin for error in this qualification campaign, especially when their opponents are ranked 137th in the world. Georgia, in fairness, are much better than their record suggests, yet there was no escaping the sense of disappointment at the final whistle among the Wales supporters.</p> <p>In a tight group that also contains Austria, Republic of Ireland and Serbia, the truth is that a home match against Georgia, who were drawn from pot six, is must-win territory.</p> <p>Wales, however, dropped two precious points and it is a measure of how well Georgia played in the second half that the damage could have been worse.</p> <p>Tornike Okriashvili\u2019s equaliser was met by near-silence in the Welsh capital and hearts were in mouths again 15 minutes later when Levan Mchedlidze ran clean through on goal only to drag his shot wide. There was another reprieve for Wales 10 minutes from time as Valeri Kazaishvili\u2019s beautifully flighted shot hit the crossbar.</p> <p>None of that was in the script when Wales took the lead in the 10th minute through Gareth Bale. It was the perfect start to the afternoon for the home side as Bale registered his 25th international goal to move within three of Ian Rush, the country\u2019s all-time leading scorer, and should have provided a platform for his side to take control of the game. Yet they never really looked like building on their advantage.</p> <p>Without the injured Aaron Ramsey and Joe Allen, Wales ended up getting overrun in midfield at times and lacked the craft and guile to break Georgia down. The fact that Georgia had 17 shots on goal \u2013 four more than Wales \u2013 tells its own story and Coleman was honest enough to admit that on another occasion he could have been discussing a defeat.</p> <p>\u201cOn our day, when we\u2019re at our best, we\u2019d go 1-0 up in a game like that and come away with the points,\u201d the Wales manager said.</p> <p>\u201cBut we looked indecisive defensively, and individually, for large parts of the second half. In the last 15 to 20 minutes, when we were trying to push, the game became open.</p> <p>\u201cWe had some good opportunities offensively. But, to be honest, Georgia could have won it themselves when they counter-attacked us. We just kept backing off and backing off, and we haven\u2019t done that for a long time. We looked fatigued, we looked disjointed.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not the end of the world, there\u2019s a lot to play for, it\u2019s only three games in. These next two games are great matches, Serbia and Republic of Ireland \u2013 they both expect to be there or thereabouts, like us.</p> <p>\u201cSo this is a nice little test for us actually, we came back from the tournament [Euro 2016] with our tails up, rightly so. But we\u2019ve just had a little slap around the back of the head to say: \u2018Hold on a minute, it\u2019s not all plain sailing.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Georgia certainly did not look like a team that came into this game having lost 20 of their previous 25 competitive away matches, winning only once \u2013 against Gibraltar \u2013 across the last decade. They played some nice football at times and perhaps it was a sign of things to come when the impressive Jano Ananidze hit the crossbar with a 20-yard free-kick in the first half.</p> <p>Wales were already ahead at that time, courtesy of Bale\u2019s predatory instincts. Towering above Solomon Kvirkvelia, he met Joe Ledley\u2019s inswinging corner with an emphatic header from the edge of the six-yard box, leaving Giorgi Loria, the Georgia goalkeeper, with no chance. Coleman punched the air and Wales were up and running. Or so it seemed.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6d848b6753a1f9b956db5cdcf2969149abd8beae\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6d848b6753a1f9b956db5cdcf2969149abd8beae/0_146_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Wales v Georgia, Gareth Bale\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Gareth Bale heads Wales into an early lead.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: NIck Potts/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Coleman felt Wales became \u201ctoo comfortable\u201d and sensed his players thought \u201cthe game was going to take care of itself\u201d. Georgia, who beat Spain in a friendly on the eve of Euro 2016, were never going to allow that to happen and delivered a wake-up call in the 57th minute. With no pressure on the ball, Kazaishvili stepped inside Chris Gunter and floated a cross towards the back post, where space had opened up in behind Neil Taylor for Okriashvili to exploit.</p> <p>Taylor, trying to get back, appealed for offside but the flag stayed down \u2013 quite rightly \u2013 and Okriashvili headed past Hennessey and into the far corner.</p> <p>At that stage the match came alive. Desperate for a winning goal Coleman threw caution to the wind with his substitutions, opening the game up at both ends. Bale\u2019s free-kick skimmed the roof of the net, Gunter\u2019s cross just eluded Sam Vokes and Hal Robson-Kanu scuffed a late shot into the arms of the Georgia keeper.</p> <p>Yet the best opportunities fell to Georgia. Ananidze forced Hennessey into a scrambled save, Kazaishvili was denied by the crossbar and sandwiched in between those two chances Mchedlidze profligately shot wide.</p> <p>Coleman refused to be downbeat. \u201cIf any team can bounce back it\u2019s this team,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve got more confidence in this team than any team I\u2019ve ever managed.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2016/oct/09/wales-v-georgia-world-cup-2018-qualifier-live\">Wales 1-1 Georgia: World Cup 2018 qualifier \u2013\u00a0as it happened!</a> </p> </aside> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/oct/09/gb-olympic-football-team-no-threat-gianni-infantino-fifa\">GB Olympic football teams no threat to separate status, says Infantino</a> </p> </aside>",

England\u2019s 309 necessitated Bangladesh\u2019s highest chase at this stadium but they were cruising.

However, an even larger monthly rise in the number of voters who mentioned the NHS \u2013 9 percentage points \u2013 made it the most-mentioned issue. It is the first time that it has been the most widely-held concern since June 2015, when 44% cited it. </p> <p>\u201cThe NHS in particular saw a rise in concern this month, as fieldwork for this survey took place as media attention was focused on the planned and then cancelled junior doctors\u2019 strikes,\u201d said Gideon Skinner, Ipsos Mori\u2019s head of political research. </p> <p>\u201cBut even so, this tallies with other research which suggests [that] while satisfaction with NHS services is holding up, concern about the future of Britain\u2019s favourite public service is growing, with record levels expecting it to get worse over the next few years, while worries over waiting times and funding are perennial underlying factors,\u201d he added. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/06/telling-nhs-doctors-go-home-self-harming-madness\">Telling NHS doctors to go home is self-harming madness  | Polly Toynbee</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Voters were not asked why they had specified certain issues when fieldwork for the latest survey was undertaken on 2 and 22 September. But the threatened series of five-day strikes by junior doctors in England over the new contract that has just been imposed on them, missed waiting time targets for treatment and a general unease about the health service\u2019s future amid the rising financial and demand pressures it is under, may explain why the NHS emerged as the commonest concern. </p> <p>\u201cAlthough some of the increased concern about the NHS is likely to be driven by the dispute between junior doctors and the government, it shows that concerns about the huge financial and operational pressures facing the NHS are filtering through to the public,\u201d said Prof Chris Ham, chief executive of the King\u2019s Fund health thinktank. </p> <p>\u201cThe public are right to be concerned, as the NHS is under huge financial pressure and waiting times are getting longer.\u201d</p> <p>Anxiety over increasing rationing of NHS care may also be a factor. September saw media coverage of various NHS bodies in England denying patients access to IVF treatment for infertility, cataract removal operations and breast cancer drugs costing just 34p a day. A major report by doctors also warned that the NHS was \u201c<a href=\"https://www.rcplondon.ac.uk/guidelines-policy/underfunded-underdoctored-overstretched-nhs-2016\">underfunded, underdoctored, overstretched</a>.\u201d </p> <p>Ham, a Downing Street adviser on the NHS in the early days of the coalition government, urged politicians to be more upfront about the state of the NHS and stop pretending that the extra \u00a310bn ministers have pledged to give the service in England during this parliament will be enough. </p> <p>\u201cPoliticians of all parties need to be honest with the public about the NHS, as it is not credible to suggest it can continue to meet demand for services and maintain standards of care at the same time as staying within the current budget,\u201d Ham added. </p> <p>The economy dropped five points between August and September; one in four people (25%) said it was an important issue. But education rose five points to 19%. Unemployment and poverty and inequality were each cited by 16%, while and housing fell seven points to 15%, despite widespread concern about the growing unaffordability of property. </p> <p>Just 13% mentioned crime, law and order or antisocial behaviour, while the numbers citing defence, foreign affairs or terrorism fell from 19% in August to just 11% in September. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/07/tories-left-right-theresa-may-brexit\">Theresa May's Tories aren't nasty, they're scared | Gaby Hinsliff</a> </p> </aside>  <p> \u201cMrs May is facing a very different public mood to her predecessor when he began his premiership.

Such voices included John Thune of South Dakota, the third-ranking Republican in the Senate.</p> <p>Democrats swiftly rejected the desertion of Trump by those who had endorsed him as political calculation \u2013 pointing out that Republicans had stood by the former reality TV star even as he disparaged Mexican immigrants, Muslims, prisoners of war, the disabled and the Gold Star parents of an Iraq war hero and repeatedly made crude statements about women.</p> <p>\u201cMcCain made it clear a long time ago: he is no longer a straight-talking maverick,\u201d Ann Kirkpatrick, the Democratic congresswoman challenging McCain for his seat, said in a statement. \u201cHe missed the chance to show political courage and lead.

  "<p>Three primary school cleaners in the West Yorkshire village of Kinsley are entering the sixth week of a strike over claims their wages and conditions have been cut since a private company took over the contract.</p> <p>Like thousands of school support staff around the country, Lesley Leake, Marice Hall and Karen McGee found that when their school was turned into an academy last year the cleaning was outsourced to a private firm.</p> <p>The women, who between them have more than 28 years\u2019 experience cleaning Kinsley primary school in the former coalmining village, said that once the contract switched from Wakefield council to C&amp;D Cleaning in April, they had their wages cut from \u00a37.85 an hour to \u00a37.20, the minimum wage. </p> <p>Leake, who has two adult children and a second job, said their pensions, sick pay and holiday entitlement had also been hit.</p> <p>\u201cThe first month when we got our payslips we just thought it could be a few teething problems but the second month it was the same, and it just went on and on.\u201d</p> <p>The women said that as they struggled to make ends meet they tried to raise the issues with C&amp;D Cleaning but were \u201cfobbed off\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThey didn\u2019t want to know. Sometimes they would just put the phone down as we were talking,\u201d said Leake. \u201cIt was pretty devastating because we\u2019d always been happy and we all depended on the money to make ends meet, pay the mortgage and bills.\u201d</p> <p>In the end the three, who all come from former mining families, got in touch with their union, Unison, but regional officer Robin Symonds said C&amp;D Cleaning, based in nearby Barnsley, was reluctant to discuss the women\u2019s cases. </p> <p>In one email seen by the Guardian, the company\u2019s head of human resources, Nick Thorpe, replied to Unison: \u201cWe do not recognise you or your organisation and subsequently we will not be entering into any form of dialogue with you in relation to our employees.\u201d </p> <p>In another, he added: \u201cI understand \u2026 the impact for you as an organisation when members realise that we are no longer living in the 1980s and they question the actual value of union membership when you have no say, power or influence over their employer.\u201d</p> <p>The three women, believing they had no other option, decided to go on strike, staging their first picket outside the school at the beginning of September.</p> <p>\u201cIt was as bit scary at first because none of us have ever done anything like this but we didn\u2019t know what else we could do,\u201d said Leake, who lives with her husband, a former miner turned caretaker, in Kinsley. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t just the money we were losing, it was the stress that was affecting us and our families as well. </p> <p>\u201cI would go home crying because it just felt we were being treated so unfairly and I didn\u2019t know how I was going to pay the mortgage or the bills.\u201d<br></p> <p>Experts say that <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.socialenterprise.org.uk/uploads/files/2012/12/the_shadow_state_3_dec1.pdf\">tens of billions of pounds\u2019 worth of contracts</a> are outsourced each year and trade unions warn that too often this process results in worse wages and conditions for the workers involved.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Last week <a href=\"https://www.unison.org.uk/news/article/2016/10/bradford-mh-strike/\">workers who provide mental health support for vulnerable people in nearby Bradford</a> went on strike over what they said were unfair imposed changes to their working hours. And last month <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/06/teaching-assistants-durham-pay-slashed-women-lions-of-durham-grunwick\">the Guardian reported on the case of teaching assistants in Durham</a> who were fighting dramatic changes to their contracts.</p> <p>Dave Prentis, the general secretary of Unison, said that for years public services \u201chad been on sale to the lowest bidder\u201d.</p> <p> \u201cWhen a service gets taken over by a private company, employees often lose out in the race to the bottom, ending up on lower pay, zero-hours contracts and working longer days.\u201d</p> <p>Unison is taking the three women\u2019s case to an employment tribunal, claiming the company may have broken rules meant to ensure workers\u2019 terms and conditions are maintained when contracts change hands.</p> <p>C&amp;D Cleaning refused to comment on the case when contacted by the Guardian, referring queries to Crooks Commercial Solicitors in Wakefield. Nick Wilson from Crooks said the firm would not be commenting on the case while an employment tribunal was under way.</p> <p>Helen Grantham, the assistant chief executive of Wakefield council, said it was \u201ccommitted to protecting staff and ensuring they have fair working conditions\u201d, adding: \u201cWe are in discussions with those involved to try and resolve the issues.\u201d</p> <p>Known locally and on social media as the <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://twitter.com/KinsleyCandD\">Kinsley Cleaners</a>, the women have been supported by their local MP, Jon Trickett, who has been in touch with the company and the school in an effort to find a solution.</p> <p>\u201cThese women are devoted to the school and the children there. They are showing real courage and principles to do this because it is not easy but they felt they had no option,\u201d said Trickett. He said their working lives had been turned upside down through no fault of their own. </p> <p>\u201cThis is part of a much bigger problem of people living in precarious jobs with employers who don\u2019t seem to have high regard for the staff that work for them and I think it is completely unacceptable.\u201d</p> <p>The three say they have been overwhelmed with support from the local community, which was at the heart of the 1984-85 miners\u2019 strike. But as they enter the sixth week of their strike McGee said all they want is their old lives and jobs back.</p> <p>\u201cI have never been on strike and I did not want to go on strike. This is all new to all of us, but we had no choice and now we are 100% determined to see it through.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 Update added on 2 November 2016. After publication C&amp;D Cleaning Services contacted us to say that they were not provided with updated information on<strong> </strong>the local living wage<strong> </strong>by Wakefield council before the transfer, and the council acknowledged an oversight. C&amp;D Cleaning Services say that now the information has been provided they have taken the necessary steps to ensure that any monies owed to the cleaners have been paid to them. </p> <p>Wakefield council issued this statement on 2 November 2016: \u201cThe council recognises that there was an oversight in providing C&amp;D Cleaning Services Ltd with the updated and accurate employee liability information on the local living wage. It had previously informed C&amp;D Cleaning Services Ltd of a collective agreement between Unison and the council for 2015/16 in February 2016. Unfortunately the council did not then confirm, prior to the actual point of transfer, that the agreement would continue into 2016/17. As soon as this was identified the council made significant efforts to rectify the situation by providing details of the most recent agreement to C&amp;D Cleaning Services Ltd so that any issues arising regarding the local living wage could be addressed. We apologise for this oversight and recognise that this, among other issues outside the council\u2019s control, has caused difficulty for all parties.\u201d<br></p>",
  "<p>Two California police officers were shot dead on Saturday while responding to a family disturbance in the town of Palm Springs, and a third was injured as police tried to bring a suspect into custody, officials said.</p> <p>Following a prolonged hunt for the suspect overnight on Saturday, the county sheriff\u2019s department said on Twitter early on Sunday morning that the suspect had been taken into custody.</p> <p>The Riverside County sheriff\u2019s department identified the suspect as John Felix and said he would be charged with two counts of murder on a peace officer. Officials said Felix surrendered after a lengthy stand-off. He was injured and treated at a hospital.</p> <p>Court records showed Felix, 26, to be a gang member who was previously sentenced to four years in prison in a failed murder plot. The <a href=\"http://desert.sn/2dCyJV8\">Desert Sun newspaper</a> cited documents that showed Felix was also the subject of a forceful arrest three years ago, at the same house where Saturday\u2019s shootings occurred.</p> <p>Felix was charged with attempted murder in a 2009 shooting. Records showed he pleaded down to assault with a firearm and admitted his gang connection.</p> <p>The two officers were killed when a man they had been speaking with suddenly pulled out a gun and opened fire, Palm Springs police chief Bryan Reyes said. The third officer remained hospitalized.

Several Swat teams were involved in the search for the suspect.

The gunman was killed by police after a brief car chase.</p> <p>The attack happened on Sunday at the Ammunition Hill light rail stop, an area that has been the site of a number of attacks over the last two years. It is close to the line dividing mainly Palestinian east Jerusalem from the mostly Jewish western side of the city.</p> <p>The attacker was provisionally identified by Israeli police as a 39-year-old resident of Silwan, a Palestinian neighbourhood of east Jerusalem.</p> <p>The victims were named as Levana Malihi, 60, a grandmother and police sergeant Yosef Kirma, 29.</p> <p>The incident began when a gunman in a car opened fire on the tram stop where one woman was shot.

But critics argue that if it has the technology to catch other photographs that cause distress, it should do more to protect users from repeated harassment.</p> <p>\u201cWe often have clients where offensive content is repeatedly posted to a social media platform so the victim has to play an endless game of \u2018whack-a-mole\u2019 to suppress new content,\u201d said Iain Wilson, a solicitor at Brett Wilson who specialises in such cases. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/16/italy-grapples-with-suicide-of-woman-taunted-over-online-sex-video\">Italy grapples with suicide of woman taunted over online sex video</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The fact that Facebook waits until pictures have been reported, unless they are known child abuse images, before taking action was no longer sufficient, according to John Carr, a leading authority on children and the internet. \u201cFacebook is like a public utility for young people, it plays a massive role in their lives,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cThere is a widespread feeling that [Facebook] is not doing enough to tackle content that their own terms and conditions forbid,\u201d Carr added. \u201cThey should be more energetically engaged in policing the content.\u201d</p> <p>But there may be another reason Facebook is not removing images before they are reported, in addition to its commitment to \u2013 and commercial reliance on \u2013 \u201cradical transparency\u201d. Under <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.iwf.org.uk/hotline/the-laws/directive-applicable-to-the-liability-of-isps/liability-of-intermediary-service-providers\">current EU law</a> social media sites are immune from liability for content as long as they react quickly to complaints, under a \u201cnotice and takedown\u201d mechanism, said Carr. </p> <p>One reason they could be reluctant to proactively search for all potentially abusive images is that, ironically, by assuming some level of editorial responsibility, in theory they could be held liable for the abuse they miss. \u201cIt\u2019s all a mess,\u201d he said. \u201cWhich is why we need a specific law saying that if companies try and prevent bad content, they won\u2019t lose their immunity if they don\u2019t always get it right.\u201d</p> <p>Facebook changed its community standards in 2012 to crack down on revenge pornography and \u201csextortion\u201d, banning nude images when they are reported. It also works with charities to target paedophile networks and on \u201cthink before you share\u201d campaigns, said a Facebook spokeswoman. </p> <p>Reporting links against every bit of content on the site flags potential abuse to a \u201cdedicated teams of reviewers who will promptly review reports and take action if content violates our community standards\u201d, the spokeswoman said. \u201cWe care deeply about protecting people\u2019s safety, and work with charities, academics and experts across the UK and Ireland to develop grassroots education programmes and help create an environment where everyone feels safe.\u201d</p> <p>Even if Facebook and other social media sites started proactively filtering potentially distressing images, by far the greater problem lies in revenge pornography and non-specific pornography sites, according to Laura Higgins, creator of the <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.revengepornhelpline.org.uk/\">Revenge Porn Hotline</a>. In a <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/hacker-leaks-revenge-porn-images-8914551#rlabs=1%20rt$category%20p$1\">recent case in Scotland</a> a hacker uploaded naked photographs of at least 20 victims, leaving one woman feeling \u201ctotally humiliated\u201d. </p> <p>Once images are online, they can be copied and reposted to dozens of other sites, making total removal extremely challenging. The hotline has received more than 5,000 calls since it was launched in February 2015, and just under 23% of them involve Twitter, Facebook and Instagram.</p> <p> \u201cIn my experience Facebook are very quick to react when an image is reported,\u201d Higgins said. \u201cThe real issue is these dedicated revenge porn sites that incite users to download images and send victims hate. If Facebook are to be held responsible, then how can these sites be even allowed to exist?\u201d</p> <p>It will take more than one high profile case to remove other barriers to victims of revenge pornography, whatever their age, receiving justice. Although a <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2016/jul/19/revenge-porn-victims-should-get-anonymity-say-75-per-cent-of-people\">recent poll</a> revealed that 75% of respondents were in favour of victims receiving anonymity, the government shows no indications of classifying the crime as a sexual offence. This means the vast majority of victims will never seek justice, said Julie Pinborough, director of the legal advice centre at Queen Mary University, which provides pro bono legal advice for victims. </p> <p>\u201cOften the prospect of going to court for victims is unbearable; they feel they have already been judged and they don\u2019t want to go through the abuse again.\u201d </p>",

With every blow Clinton delivered (discussing Trump\u2019s tax returns, his \u201cMiss Piggy\u201d comments, and so on), and with every one of Trump\u2019s own missed opportunities, the value of those S&amp;P 500 futures contracts rose. Investors clearly decided they would prefer to own US stocks under a President Clinton than a President Trump.</p> <p>In fact, Justin Wolfers, a professor of economics and public policy at the University of Michigan, calculated that based on the magnitude of the market movements during that first debate, if Trump wins the election next month, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/02/upshot/debate-night-message-the-markets-are-afraid-of-donald-trump.html?_r=0\">it could trigger a stock market selloff of between 10% and 12%</a>. </p> <p>It\u2019s not that investors care whether Trump did or didn\u2019t pay taxes, or that he <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/07/donald-trump-leaked-recording-women\">brags about groping women</a> without their consent. The markets just don\u2019t worry about that kind of stuff.</p> <p>What does matter is whether investors believe Trump will create a stable, predictable, business-friendly environment. For all his claims to be friendly toward business, and despite a platform that offers favorable tax treatment to corporations and the wealthy, clearly investors are bothered about the \u201cstable and predictable\u201d part of the conundrum. </p> <p>Trump has threatened to embark on trade wars \u2013 that\u2019s enough to strike terror into the heart of any investor. Then there are <a href=\"http://www.marketwatch.com/story/citi-says-donald-trumps-odds-of-winning-in-november-are-increasing-2016-09-19\">some \u201cblack swan\u201d risks</a> to which analysts have begun alerting their clients, such as the potential fallout for financial markets if Trump pulls the US out of multilateral trade and security arrangements, from Nafta to Nato. </p> <p>What happens when Trump insults a foreign leader, or orders a US warship to fire on an Iranian vessel, triggering a war? Or \u2013 God forbid \u2013 decides to use some of the nuclear arsenal to \u201ctake out\u201d Isis? We can all forget about our retirement funds at that point; they\u2019ll vanish in the mushroom cloud.

Despite her increasingly populist rhetoric against the financial institutions, the apparent <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/news/election-us-2016-37595047\">transcripts of speeches she gave to Goldman Sachs</a> and other banks before casting her hat into the ring suggest that as Bernie Sanders and his supporters had insisted, she was actually much more supportive than she now makes herself out to be. </p> <p>The speeches reveal a candidate who is pro-free trade and who suggested she would be amenable to maintaining the much-criticized \u201crevolving door\u201d between Wall Street and its regulators. \u201cThe people that know the industry better than anybody are the people who work in the industry,\u201d she said, according to the transcripts.</p> <p>That\u2019s the pragmatic Clinton of before the election, and it suggests that, if anything, her victory next month would at least be good news for those Americans with an interest in a stable economy and stable markets.</p> <p>But if you\u2019re hoping for a \u201cClinton rally\u201d, don\u2019t hold your breath.</p> <p>Especially in the wake of the first debate \u2013 and in light of the bombshell revelations about Trump\u2019s taxes and open mic comments about groping women \u2013 the markets now have largely priced in a Clinton victory. </p> <p>If Clinton wins, we won\u2019t see big changes in economic policies \u2013 she is, more or less, familiar, which is something that markets love, because it gives them something that they adore: \u201ctransparency\u201d or \u201cvisibility\u201d. If traders and big institutional investors, like the mutual fund managers at Fidelity, can look forward and predict, more or less, what is going to happen (or if they think they can), they\u2019ll be more comfortable with the valuations that they\u2019re paying for stocks today. If there are too many wild cards, they\u2019ll take their money off the table.</p> <p>But a Clinton victory, heading toward the eighth anniversary of the start of the current bull market in stocks, wouldn\u2019t give anyone any encouragement to think that this was the start of something dramatically positive either. Should she be elected, stock valuations would still be in nosebleed territory. Interest rates would still be too low, and would be heading upward, putting downward pressure on the prices of stocks and bonds simultaneously. </p> <p>There\u2019s a phenomenon known as the <a href=\"http://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/presidentialelectioncycle.asp\">presidential election cycle theory</a>. In brief, it argues that the first year following a presidential election is always bad for markets, regardless of who wins \u2013 Republican or Democrat.

That\u2019s the lowest of any growth period since 1949. </p> <p>Those challenges will all remain in place in the unlikely event that either of the two third-party candidates triumphs on election day. They would be magnified by the fact that neither would have natural allies from their own party in Congress, making it infinitely more difficult to implement even basic economic policy. The predictability and stability factors that are an issue with Trump would exist with Gary Johnson or Jill Stein, albeit for different reasons. </p> <p>There are plenty of compelling reasons to cast a ballot on 8 November, heaven knows, without thinking about which result will be best for your investment portfolio.

  "<p><strong>UPDATE. September 2017: lawyers for Sam Allardyce have contacted us to say that he disputes the allegation that he gave advice on how to circumvent the FA\u2019s rules on third party ownership. </strong></p> <p>A starlet at a Premier League club is to be promoted to the first team. His agent has represented him since the age of 16 and they enjoy a good relationship. Then, the manager informs a different registered intermediary (the official term) the player will be catapulted from earning a few hundred pounds a week into the \u00a320,000-a-week bracket. What else is the intermediary, who does not represent the young hopeful, told?</p> <p>Dan Chapman, a lawyer and intermediary at Full Contact, a sports law firm, takes up the story. \u201cThis manager says: \u2018There will be a new contract on the table for him [the player]. It\u2019s massive. That means his agent is going to pick up a nice fee. But what I want is to destabilise the relationship between player and agent. The big agent\u2019s fee will go to you instead.\u2019</p> <p>\u201cThe proposed new agent, who\u2019s never spoken to the player in his life, thinks: \u2018How can I destabilise him?\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Once it was discovered that two of the player\u2019s family members were out of work, Chapman says that both were given expensive gifts and told \u201c\u2018You need to persuade your boy to sign with this guy,\u2019 not withstanding that\u2019s in breach of contract. It ended up in a court dispute and a settlement.\u201d</p> <p>According to the various agents, lawyers, academics and other industry insiders the Guardian spoke with during this investigation, the episode Chapman relates is one of a countless number that contributes to their view football is \u201cendemically corrupt\u201d.</p> <p>What also emerged was a concern more could be done by key stakeholders such as the Football Association, Premier League, English Football League, League Managers Association, and Professional Footballers\u2019 Association. During the investigation it was repeatedly claimed all are reluctant to take responsibility for eradicating widespread bad practices despite having a duty of care to their respective members and this alleged inactivity potentially leading to millions of pounds in illicit payments.</p> <p>When contacted, the various bodies denied this. The Premier League, EFL, PFA and FA said they take governance of the game particularly seriously. The Premier League referred to a joint statement, issued a fortnight ago with the EFL and FA, which said: \u201cAny substantive allegations will be investigated with the full force of the rules at our disposal, which are wide\u2011ranging and well-developed.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/27/sam-allardyce-leaves-england-manager-role-fa\">Sam Allardyce leaves 'dream' England manager job after one game in charge</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The LMA told the Guardian: \u201cAlongside the FA and other principal stakeholders we want to fully investigate any and all substantive allegations of corruption, quickly and comprehensively.\u201d</p> <p>The FA pointed to its integrity unit, which handles any accusation of wrongdoing and how full transparency and disclosure is offered where possible. The PFA chief executive, Gordon Taylor, said: \u201cThe PFA is committed to removing any form of corruption from the game and will support any positive efforts by the relevant stakeholders in this area.\u201d</p> <p>Chapman is certain the FA could do far more. Regarding the incidents such as one involving the starlet, he says: \u201cPotentially there are civil matters there \u2013 breach of contract. And criminal. It also breaches FA regulations to make a payment to a third party to obtain a client.</p> <p>\u201c Any agent could give many examples when this happens. It has happened at our agency. You go to the FA and report it. They\u2019ll just say: \u2018No hard evidence, it\u2019s all circumstantial, we can\u2019t do anything about it \u2013 sorry.\u2019\u201d Again, the FA denied this, saying it investigates any known incident where possible.</p> <p>Andy Evans is a lawyer and founder of World in Motion, an agency that has represented players and clubs since 1997. His clients include the Manchester United defender Chris Smalling, and Chelsea. Evans is insistent the FA abdicated responsibility in April 2015 when Fifa devolved power over agents to individual associations.</p> <p>\u201cThe FA refused to enter meaningful discussion with anybody on the agents\u2019 side,\u201d he says. \u201cThe FA was given a chance to regulate by Fifa. They had it all in their own hands: whatever systems, whatever regulations they wanted, to regulate the transfer system, the conduct of agents. And they chose to do the bare minimum and, significantly, to adopt a far less regulated system than the one previously in place.</p> <p>\u201cThe FA opted to implement standard pro-forma documents and chose to absolve themselves of any real responsibility in the policing of the transfer system. They removed the entrance exam, which was a real barrier to entry with only 10% of candidates passing, and they opened it up to a \u00a3500 fee, basically saying: \u2018Give us \u00a3500 and you can be a professional.\u2019 You can\u2019t imagine a similar system of licensing in the legal, accounting, financial services sector or any profession that values the role of the adviser.</p> <p>\u201cThere is now this unsatisfactory situation, for example, where the FA does not review any contracts submitted between player and agent prior to lodging it \u2013 accepting it \u2013 as a contract. This offers no protection to the player from unscrupulous agents and allows multiple agency agreements to be in place at any one time.</p> <p>\u201cThere was reportedly a deal in the summer transfer window where there were at least seven lodged contracts for one particular player alone. So the FA reportedly accepted seven representation contracts. Whose fault is this? Clearly the player. But how can that be any form of reliable, functioning system?\u201d</p> <p>The FA acknowledged multiple contracts may be lodged but stated this is the player\u2019s responsibility. The governing body also pointed to its instigation of a maximum two-year contract with a representative as material evidence of a wish to safeguard a footballer\u2019s welfare.</p> <p>Dr Giambattista Rossi is the coauthor of Sports Agents and Labour Markets and a lecturer at Birkbeck, University of London. He believes European football\u2019s governing body failed to show leadership in April 2015. \u201cI blame Uefa. They should have stood up and said: \u2018We are the best example of football in the world \u2013 in terms of governance, transparency, whatever \u2013 so let\u2019s prepare a proposal to regulate agents at least at European level. And then, in China, Brazil, wherever, they [will] want to follow us because the main turnover of transfers is in Europe.\u2019</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b4663b340216810605221c650dc75ddd4c5a35ca\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b4663b340216810605221c650dc75ddd4c5a35ca/0_100_2500_1500/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Carlos Tevez and Javier Mascherano\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Carlos Tevez and Javier Mascherano were subject to third-party ownership when they signed for West Ham in 2006.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Shaun Curry/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cThere is something to regulate but everybody is wanting to stand back and doesn\u2019t want to regulate. From the European perspective, football is a competitive industry - agents are considered as any recruitment company and these people are [usually] regulated. A very banal example: if you operate in the stock exchange market you need to be licensed: yes or no? Of course, because you are dealing with money, you require integrity, transparency, a certain level of trust.</p> <p>\u201cSince 2006 everybody is saying: \u2018Look, the turnover is increasing\u2019 and the fact it is not controlled is ridiculous. This has always happened because these are agreements everybody can do: simply a manager saying: \u2018OK, I\u2019ll buy that player, I will help you, you will give me under the table this amount of money.\u2019 This has always existed. What is surprising is people are probably still shocked.\u201d</p> <p>Liz Ellen is the head of sport at the legal firm Mishcon de Reya, which advises a wide range of clubs. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/aug/21/malky-mackay-iain-moody-dossier-fa-cardiff-city\">These have included Cardiff City</a> when the transfers of the former manager Malky Mackay were investigated two years ago. The Football Association announced in July 2015 it would not charge Mackay with any offence.</p> <p>Ellen believes there is a sense of entitlement in football. \u201cIf I bring in a new piece of work I would never expect any kind of kickback,\u201d she says. \u201cToo often in football it is seen as a natural consequence that when a deal happens someone should get something for it.\u201d</p> <p>Ellen believes a sea change is required. \u201cThere\u2019s got to be an actual shift in approach. They don\u2019t accept that what they\u2019re doing is wrong. They don\u2019t see the victim in it. People need to be scared of being caught. \u201cI qualified as an agent before I started as a lawyer. I\u2019ve never worked as an agent, I\u2019ve always done it as a lawyer because I\u2019ve found in the industry too inherently corrupt to allow people to act transparently.</p> <p>\u201cThe industry is so twisted that for the many agents who want to do it right they\u2019re pushed out of it in favour of agents who will do it the other way or they will lose players because the parents have been bunged something.</p> <p>\u201cWe had a situation where one of the very top young talents was represented by an independent agent. He was a really good guy \u2013 he would send him autobiographies and DVDs of players he could learn from. On the cusp of a very substantial deal, his first as a professional, which this agent had negotiated by himself, a family member appeared from nowhere and convinced the player to go with a different agent. There can be no sense in that. And the money that\u2019s paid to the family member comes from the club, which comes from the fan.\u201d</p> <p>She remembers Cardiff owner, Vincent Tan, said that when corruption is proved: \u201c\u2018It\u2019s the fans who are losing out.\u2019 If someone is spending millions on players they shouldn\u2019t be buying, that comes from fans.</p> <p>\u201cThe governing bodies don\u2019t particularly want to look into it because they know it\u2019s a big can of worms.\u201d</p> <p>Ellen, like others the Guardian spoke to, is also concerned about duality. \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t be allowed in any other industry. You don\u2019t have an estate agent who acts for and is paid by both sides,\u201d she says. \u201cThat again is a problem of regulation. It was banned for a short time then reintroduced. The reason? Because they thought if they don\u2019t make it something allowed, people will do it anyway, under the table. That\u2019s not the answer. If it\u2019s something you shouldn\u2019t do, you shouldn\u2019t do it. Managers\u2019 agents shouldn\u2019t be representing players as well. There should be a strict distinction. I can give many examples of where the manager\u2019s agent is representing half of the team as well.\u201d</p> <p>City of London police are reviewing the Daily Telegraph\u2019s evidence of its claims <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/video/2016/sep/28/sam-allardyce-quits-england-manager-67-days-video-report\">regarding Sam Allardyce</a>, Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink, Eric Black, Tommy Wright and Harry Redknapp. This, as Taylor points out, is in conjunction with the FA as \u201cthe regulator of the game\u201d.</p> <p>Chapman believes the police should be more active. \u201cWhy on earth didn\u2019t the FA investigate that illegal payments were flying around? They were aware that case was going to court,\u201d he says of the starlet. \u201cWhy are people not being put in prison? Until someone is put behind bars I don\u2019t think people will take it seriously because most disputes end up being resolved with financial settlements.\u201d</p> <p>Allardyce lost his job as the England manager for, in part, offering advice on how to bypass third-party ownership. TPO is banned yet the Guardian was told repeatedly that if facilitated correctly, it offers a career opportunity to a player that may not have been available. The practice is accepted as the norm in South America, while in Europe the Spanish and Portuguese football authorities were against its eradication, which occurred in May 2015.</p> <p>Marcos Motta is a TPO expert who advised on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/09/neymar-psg-barcelona-offered-sign-650000\">Neymar\u2019s move to Barcelona</a> from Santos in 2013. He was also a lawyer for MSI, the company that brokered a deal with West Ham United in August 2006 to take Carlos Tevez and Javier Mascherano to the club. The lines remain blurred as Fifa allows an agent a lump sum of any future transfer fee but not a percentage as the latter is considered TPO.</p> <p>Motta says: \u201cTPO is part of the game so let\u2019s regulate it. Why try to close the door to investors? The Sam Allardyce affair shows the system has failed \u2013 the ban has failed, it does not work. When there is vast money around you need proper regulation, transparency. When you try to ban a process people try to circumvent it.</p> <p>\u201cTPO is a kind of commercial and financial tool that has been used by South American clubs for a long time. We South Americans do not have this wide range of revenues that European clubs have. We have our assets \u2013 players. The very first time European clubs had the contact with the concept of TPO was the Tevez-Mascherano affair, which I was involved in because I was one of the lawyers of MSI in Brazil.</p> <p>\u201cThe concept then spread throughout Europe by agents and clubs and investors. But there was nothing illegal \u2013 all these tools were used in Brazil under the strict commercial codes and rules of taxation.</p> <p>\u201cI had a chance to be part of the Fifa working group that ultimately banned TPO on a worldwide scale. This was during the Brazil World Cup in 2014. In the subsequent meetings in Switzerland the following November the working group was divided in terms of vision.</p> <p>\u201cOn our side, which was not for banning TPO, I represented South America. There was also Daniel Lorenz, of Porto, a club that was very good in working TPO, and Javier Tebas, the president of La Liga. On the other side there were David Gill, representing Uefa, and FifPro. They based their claim on first, a kind of modern slavery which was also in a speech give by Mr Platini [former Uefa president].</p> <p>\u201cI am a sports lawyer since 1996 and have participated in deals like Ronaldo, Robinho, Roberto Carlos, Neymar, Fernandinho, the twins at Manchester United [Rafael and Fabio da Silva] \u2013 more than 300 deals. And more than once I saw these collapse simply because the player didn\u2019t want to go. So ultimately players control their own career. So, modern slavery? I cannot agree with that. Secondly they were saying the money was not staying in the game. It\u2019s not staying in the game if you have banning. Because if you have proper transparency and security on TPO for the investor and they experience spectacular returns of course they will reinvest.</p> <p>\u201cFor me the issue is that players in South America were becoming costly. I experienced issues in Brazil in which European clubs came here and said: \u2018We want to buy your starlet for X-million euros\u2019 and the Brazilian club needing money, accepted.</p> <p>\u201cWith TPO in place we have new guests at the table, which are the investors. So we have meetings where clubs say: \u2018No, we don\u2019t want to sell this player for this amount because this amount we already have from this investor. So we need more money.\u2019 And this can double, triple the price.\u201d</p> <p>Motta\u2019s opinion that there is confusion regarding TPO was reflected in a wider view of a lack of knowledge within the industry. Evans says: \u201cI strongly believe there should be ongoing learning for agents as there is in the legal practice. For example, ask the vast majority of the new intermediaries what the new work permit regulations are and they wouldn\u2019t have a clue. Ask a significant number the basic premises of contract law and they would not be able to answer.</p> <p>\u201cThere is a need for a strong agents\u2019 association that has commercial and trade specific codes of practice. Intermediaries in football have been allowed to walk through a gate for \u00a3500. The FA have allowed that to happen. It\u2019s actually shameful: what other regulatory body would allow that?\u201d</p> <p>Ellen is clear what should be done. \u201cFootball tries to regulate itself. It\u2019s not an industry that invites external scrutiny,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s the opposite: they try to do everything to make sure politicians don\u2019t get involved or the police or whoever it may be. On the one hand they [the police] are generally shut out of the game, on the other is it a priority for them? Is it something they can easily follow?</p> <p>\u201cOften the people who know what\u2019s going on are the people who are implicated. So anyone who has evidence is someone who has done something wrong so you struggle to pin down the hard evidence you need to go forward with it.</p> <p>\u201cIf you take Cardiff as example \u2013 we managed to get a search order. That\u2019s the only time so far [in football]. And that\u2019s because you happened to have an owner who wanted to investigate alleged corruption.</p> <p>\u201cNow you\u2019ll find there are a lot of clubs who know there is an issue and they don\u2019t want to look into it, they don\u2019t want to find out what\u2019s gone on. In terms of actual scrutiny clubs should have much more visibility of what their staff are doing. If you were really going for it you\u2019d say that all of your managers give full disclosure of bank accounts, their emails, phone records, everything \u2013 at the start and on an ongoing basis. Clubs wouldn\u2019t dare ask for it and most managers wouldn\u2019t give it. At the moment you\u2019ve got that impasse where people don\u2019t really want to get to the bottom of the problem.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>In 1990, I became aware of a man who was pretending to be me. This was in the days when my face was hardly known \u2013 before I was that bloke off panel shows who looks like Pavarotti after a tree fell on him. So my impersonator was able to pass himself off fairly easily as \u201cAndy Hamilton, comedy writer\u201d. He fooled a surprising number of people. One young woman was under the impression she had been living with me for six months. Many women found they had lent me money that I had not yet got round to paying back. Several people ended up working (unpaid) on a movie that didn\u2019t exist.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"3891ef473f5d24f79ee391b8a27a9a0f7db6a56b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3891ef473f5d24f79ee391b8a27a9a0f7db6a56b/53_23_2417_3021/800.jpg\" alt=\"The real Andy Hamilton.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The real Andy Hamilton.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Fisher/Rex</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>One young woman was under the impression she had been living with me for six months</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>For me, this fantasist\u2019s escapades were, for nearly a decade, a persistent pain in the arse. He was outrageously confident and had a talent for telling vaguely plausible lies \u2013 or rather, plausibly vague lies. Detail was his Kryptonite. But in the end, he would invariably overreach himself and be revealed as a fake. So I consoled myself with the thought that, eventually, this is what always happens to charlatans.<br></p> <p>Until this year. <br></p> <p>Because 2016 is shaping up to be the year that the fantasists get a free pass. It is proving to be the year of what commentators have dubbed \u201cpost-factual politics\u201d. And an environment where facts carry little weight is an ideal habitat for fantasists.<br></p> <p>So what exactly is a fantasist? Well, a fantasist is much more than a liar. We all lie sometimes, to protect ourselves, or gain some advantage, or to spare someone\u2019s feelings, or to get rid of a cold-caller. (I recommend feigning a heart attack.) Liars lie for a purpose, but fantasists just make things up. True, the fiction usually adds to some cathedral of self-aggrandisement that they\u2019re building, but they tend not to plan the lie beforehand. It leaps out of some instinctual lobe of their brain, in a split second. When you watch Donald Trump coming out with that stuff, that is probably the first time he\u2019s heard it.<br></p> <p>Also, the liar <em>knows</em> he is lying, before and after, whereas, for the fantasist, the moment the lie leaves his lips it transforms itself into incontrovertible truth. Fantasists need this alchemy because they are narcissists who can never, <em>never</em> be wrong. When their fragile narrative is challenged they have a tendency to turn nasty. That is the reason they can be so dangerous and why we shouldn\u2019t vote for them.<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c57989d314906badff5377c1740cff1f03eb3ec8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c57989d314906badff5377c1740cff1f03eb3ec8/0_116_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Inside outsider \u2026 Ukip\u2019s Nigel Farage.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Inside outsider \u2026 Ukip\u2019s Nigel Farage.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ben Birchall/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>For the fantasist, the moment the lie leaves his lips it transforms itself into incontrovertible truth</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>If we look at the year so far \u2013 and, God help us, it isn\u2019t over yet \u2013 we can see the emergence of a febrile new world where accuracy and authenticity are seen as irrelevances; a world where being an obvious fake is no longer any kind of impediment. You can mythologise yourself: you can be a billionaire man-of-the-people, you can be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/25/left-behind-eu-referendum-vote-ukip-revolt-brexit\">a public-school-educated ex-banker who is an \u201cestablishment outsider</a>\u201d, you can invent your own custom-made \u201cfacts\u201d and fire them through the spray gun of social media. You can invoke a golden age without ever specifying which age that was. Basically, you make up whatever irrational tosh you like, preferably tosh that activates the anger that lies dormant inside all those people who believe that their entire life is somebody else\u2019s fault.<br></p> <p>Perhaps the most disturbing aspect of this new atmosphere is that so many people seem to have stopped caring if someone is lying to them. For instance, Donald Trump has repeatedly asserted that, after the attacks of 9/11, 10,000 Muslims were out celebrating on the streets of New Jersey. There were no Muslims celebrating in New Jersey. Or anywhere else. The only place where that happened was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/series/lyin-trump-a-weekly-fact-check\">inside Donald Trump\u2019s head</a>. Normally, a fantastical invention like that would sound the death-knell for any candidate. But not now.

But those who wanted to believe it believed it, and the rest just gave a resigned shrug. All right, yes, Evan Davis got worked up about it on Newsnight, and various liberal newspapers deplored it. But the lie stayed out there, insidiously going about its business. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/26/eu-referendum-brexit-vote-leave-iain-duncan-smith-nhs\">Another lie was painted on to the side of a bus and remained there even after it had been exposed</a>. The Electoral Commission should have insisted on a second bus with a correction painted on it.<br></p> <p>Of course, for fantasists to prosper, they need rationalism to be put to flight. In the last few years, we have seen a growing trend to say the word <em>experts</em> in inverted commas. Michael Gove (son of a Scots fisherman and ordinary Joe) declared that the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/2016/jun/08/experts-eu-referendum-michael-gove\">British people were sick and tired of \u201cexperts\u201d</a>. You just can\u2019t trust them, these people who\u2019ve spent their working lives studying something that anyone can look up for themselves on the internet. By the same illogic, statistics and independent studies are now often greeted with open scorn and, in the US, a lot of the electorate seem to have decided that facts are a form of witchcraft.<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"df1fbb1b10835f69899f71bccf522ff4013d4f62\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/df1fbb1b10835f69899f71bccf522ff4013d4f62/208_610_4450_2670/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The \u201cVote Leave\u201d battle-bus, and the slogan everyone knew to be untrue, but hey\u2026\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The \u201cVote Leave\u201d battle-bus, and the slogan everyone knew to be untrue, but hey\u2026</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Paul Ellis/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>To an extent, we may have brought this on ourselves.

We have been reading pointless books about \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2012/feb/10/emotional-intelligence-thinking-feeling-job\">emotional intelligence</a>\u201d. We have been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/higher-education-network/2016/jan/26/why-people-fall-for-pseudoscience-and-how-academics-can-fight-back\">indulging sciences that contain not the slightest particle of science</a>, not even the memory of science.

We have allowed the 24-hour media to frighten us into a constant state of hysteria, even though our lives are longer, safer and healthier than they have ever been. We have moved into a world where feelings outrank thought, where we share our emotions instantly, incessantly and incontinently with people we\u2019ve never met, as we binge on moral outrage and conspiracy theories. We are losing the faculties we need to spot snake-oil salesmen. Or unhinged demagogues. And as 2016 careers on \u2013 like a stolen car driven by drunk teenagers - it is starting to feel as if the forces of reason are ready to throw in the towel.<br></p> <p>I should declare an interest here. If reason does not prevail, then I am out of a job. Comedy begins from a standpoint of reason, without reason it\u2019s impossible to identify what\u2019s absurd. Jokes are a playful form of reasoning. This is why Nazi Germany produced no great standups. Of course, the atmosphere in Germany during the 1930s was extremely \u201cpost-factual\u201d. And they ended up voting for a ridiculous fantasist as their leader. I\u2019m just saying, that\u2019s all. (I won\u2019t pursue this any further, as I don\u2019t want to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/apr/28/ken-livingstone-suspended-from-labour-after-hitler-remarks\">set Ken Livingstone off</a>.)<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"feb4165d0bc741ec47d6e1000fdb7b922583d1d2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/feb4165d0bc741ec47d6e1000fdb7b922583d1d2/0_0_2966_2154/1000.jpg\" alt=\"No great standups \u2026 Nazi Germany.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"726\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">No great standups \u2026 \u2018post-factual\u2019 Nazi Germany.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Hulton Archive/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Back in the 1990s, the only upside of my experience with the fake Andy Hamilton was that it made me question what I knew.

In time, a story began to form inside my head, which I eventually <a href=\"https://unbound.com/books/star-witness\">turned into a novel</a>. (Just published, since you ask).<br></p> <p>Of course, one of the joys of writing fiction is that you give your story the ending you want. But the potential endings for 2016 look like ones that no one could want. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/far-right\">Demagogues seem to be in the ascendancy all over Europe</a>. While it is quite possible that the American people are about to elect a man who is unhinged.

Let's hope this isn't the year we all move in with them</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>One final thought, however. It would be so very easy for us to luxuriate in the belief that a Trump could never happen here, to feel somehow insulated by the British character. Yes, we may have had ridiculous fantasists in our politics, but they\u2019ve all been comic, harmless sideshows, like <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2001/jul/19/archer.politics2\">Jeffrey Archer</a>. But hold on, Jeffrey wasn\u2019t always seen as a self-deluding loser. In 2000, according to the opinion polls, he was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/1999/nov/22/londonmayor.uk12\">on the brink of being elected mayor of London</a>. Then, true to character, he boasted about the wrong thing to the wrong person at a party, and ended up being charged with perjury.

  "<p>As conspicuous displays of wealth go, the mooring of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/06/russian-billionaires-superyacht-makes-waves-in-london\">Motor Yacht A</a> \u2013 owned by Russian tycoon Andrey Melnichenko \u2013 last month on one of the most striking spots on the Thames, next to D-day warship HMS Belfast by Tower Bridge, was hard to top. One of the world\u2019s largest superyachts, the Philippe Starck-designed, 119-metre (390ft) white vessel \u2013 which features three swimming pools, a helipad and bombproof glass \u2013 embodies an exclusive lifestyle that is highly visible but inaccessible to all but the global financial elite and their entourage.</p> <p>But Melnichenko, who made his \u00a39.2bn fortune in coal and fertilisers, has put the distinctive boat up for sale after upgrading to the \u00a3347m, 143-metre Sailing Yacht A, believed to be similarly named to ensure it is listed first in shipping registers. His new vessel, which features three carbon masts more than 90 metres tall with a sail area greater than a standard football pitch, is the tenth-largest superyacht in the world. It propels him into the premier league of private yacht owners alongside fellow oligarch Roman Abramovich, whose 162.5-metre Eclipse is currently the second-largest.</p> <p>The Chelsea football club owner\u2019s spectacular \u00a3724m vessel, which made headlines last summer when it briefly moored on the river Clyde in Scotland, far from its usual cruising grounds, is believed to feature two swimming pools (one of which has an adjustable depth that allows it to be converted into a dancefloor), an exterior fireplace, a leisure submarine, armour plating, bulletproof windows, a missile defence system and an anti-paparazzi shield designed to dazzle digital cameras.</p> <p>But one British academic has managed to penetrate this elusive milieu. Emma Spence has spent the last six years researching the industry, has crewed on superyachts around the world and shadowed a yacht broker in the tax haven of Monaco, observing how the boats are deployed to establish a pecking order among the super-rich. The researcher is completing a PhD on the superyacht scene and says the vessels are unique among prestige assets: unlike private jets they are not a useful mode of transport; unlike art and property, they always depreciate in value. Instead, as one owner told her, what makes a yacht desirable is that it \u201callows the super-rich to perform their wealth status\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2014/sep/07/crewing-on-superyachts-wealth-careers\">Sun, sea and silver service: what\u2019s it like crewing on a superyacht?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Superyachts are defined as boats with hulls that measure longer than 24 metres at the waterline and that require a professional crew to operate. With basic annual maintenance and operation costs expected to be 10% of the original purchase price, ownership is the preserve of multi-millionaires and billionaires.</p> <p>In a forthcoming book on the lifestyles of the super-rich, Spence explains how merely possessing these elite craft is not enough to enhance the profile of the super-rich; how and where the yacht is used is equally important. This is why most owners and charterers of the luxury vessels prefer to go to prominent ports with bars and restaurants where they can guarantee an audience of super-rich peers. Her research focused on the C\u00f4te d\u2019Azur, the centre of the superyacht scene, where hundreds of luxury vessels line the docks in Saint-Tropez, Nice, Antibes, Cannes and Monaco, the most prestigious port in the Mediterranean.</p> <p>Among the owners she witnessed projecting their status were billionaire retailer Sir Philip Green, who took delivery of his third superyacht \u2013 the \u00a3100m, 90-metre Lionheart, his second boat to bear that name \u2013 earlier this year. While she was crewing on a yacht belonging to somebody else in Saint-Tropez in 2013, Green came on board without invitation. \u201cHe walked up on the aft deck in board shorts and a T-shirt \u2013 standard super-rich attire, as casual as you can be,\u201d she says. \u201cThe grownup children [of the owner] and friends all immediately stood to attention until he told them it was OK to sit down. I\u2019ve never seen anyone else command that respect on someone else\u2019s yacht.\u201d</p> <p>The perma-tanned Topshop tycoon recently finished a two-month Mediterranean cruise with his wife, Tina, leaving their daughter, Chloe, on board in Monaco, where yacht owners and industry insiders gathered last month at the world\u2019s most prestigious yacht show to size up one another\u2019s nautical assets. \u201cThe family\u2019s got a permanent berth there and I\u2019ve docked alongside him for many years,\u201d says Spence. \u201cOne time, years ago in Monaco, a \u2018rival\u2019 crew climbed on board in the night and changed the boat\u2019s name with tape to Lion Fart.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"f4186426207d51dcee32086eea2c02d02a806d95\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f4186426207d51dcee32086eea2c02d02a806d95/0_54_1600_960/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Philip Green\u2019s yacht Lionheart.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Philip Green\u2019s yacht Lionheart.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: http://livornodailyphoto.blogspot.co.uk</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Some yacht owners are attracted to tourist resorts in the French Riviera because an integral part of their lifestyle is projecting their privilege beyond their elite peer group, Spence adds. \u201cYou have this tension between the privacy that yachts and the sea afford against this desire to see and be seen,\u201d she says. \u201cTourists remind the super-rich of their wealth and their social status. In Saint-Tropez, you have hundreds of people on the docks as the yachts come in. The guests sit there on the aft deck. Most of these people you wouldn\u2019t know if you passed them in the street. They\u2019re not celebrities. But when they finally descend [ashore] there\u2019s still this awe.\u201d</p> <p>Spence saw how a group of young men who were children of superyacht owners often encourage this fascination with their way of life. \u201cEach night, they\u2019d go to big clubs, such as the VIP Rooms in Saint-Tropez or Gotha in Cannes, spend \u00a35,000, \u00a310,000 on a table and buy huge bottles of Dom P\u00e9rignon with sparklers,\u201d she says. \u201cThere\u2019s a group of young women that spends the day going from one port to the other, getting entry to these clubs and schmoozing these wealthy young men. The women come on board the boats, go up to the top deck and ask for champagne. They\u2019re all drunk and you\u2019re trying to explain at 3am that they can\u2019t wear stilettos on board.\u201d</p> <p>While in the clubs of the C\u00f4te d\u2019Azur, uber-wealthy heirs might lavish money on these hangers-on, but back on their parents\u2019 yachts, their attitude changes. \u201cOn board, it\u2019s the parent\u2019s stack of wine \u2013 it\u2019s not something to be given away,\u201d says Spence. \u201cThe older son of one owner came down to check I was serving the cheapest champagne. You downgrade from vintage Dom to Veuve Clicquot \u2013 from 100 euros a bottle to 30 euros.\u201d</p> <p>The super-rich also use their yachts to control the level of access they grant to those outside their wealthy circle, says Spence. For example, some exploited maritime law to get rid of the young women they brought back from the clubs. In the morning, they would go to bed and order the yacht to leave port, knowing the crew would have to remove any stragglers before they set sail. \u201cIf you\u2019re in port then you can have as many people on board as you want but at sea you can only have 12 passengers, unless you have large-yacht certification,\u201d says Spence. \u201cThe owner\u2019s sons would just slink off to their cabins leaving a few random women dotted around the yacht. It\u2019s awkward when these people think they\u2019re going to stay and spend the week partying on a yacht and then they\u2019re unceremoniously kicked off.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/apr/03/super-rich-discover-hidden-risks-instagram-yachts-jets\">Yachts, jets and stacks of cash: super-rich discover risks of Instagram snaps</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The symbiotic relationship between superyacht owners and crew is not as one-sided as it might appear. During the Monaco Grand Prix, securing the most prestigious berth on the T-jetty \u2013 the first row of yachts on the race start line \u2013 is reliant on the captain\u2019s contacts, not the owner\u2019s, says Spence. \u201cIt\u2019s knowing who to pay extra to for the privilege. It\u2019s a reflection of the owner\u2019s status, but it\u2019s done via the connections of the crew. If your captain speaks fluent French and has worked in the industry for years, then they\u2019ll have much a better chance of getting into a prominent position in the port.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe whole industry is completely gendered,\u201d says Spence. \u201cThe interior crew are women and the deck crew are male. I\u2019ve come across two female captains in six years of researching the industry, and I know of two chief stewards who are female. The women retire because owners don\u2019t want them in the interior of a boat after a certain age \u2013 late 30s and you\u2019re off.\u201d</p> <p>The majority of owners buy superyachts secondhand via brokers and refit them to their tastes. Camper &amp; Nicholsons put the global number of yachts of at least 30 metres at 4,476, with 268 sold via brokers last year at a total cost of $2.68bn (\u00a32.18bn), or an average of $10m. They estimate that 222 yachts of over 30 metres have been bought worldwide so far this year. The next step up is to buy or commission a \u201cseries yacht\u201d from a shipyard, which will have the same cabin configuration, exterior style and machinery across the line, but the owner will dictate the furniture and furnishings. The top tier are custom-designed by naval architects and can take shipyards several years to complete.</p> <p>Peter Thompson, a broker at Monaco-based Thompson, Westwood and White Yachts, says eastern European oligarchs and Gulf royals dominate the 100-metre-plus superyacht market, also known as gigayachts.</p> <p>The primary factor behind the increasing size of superyachts is the growing wealth of the super-rich. The number of ultra-high-net-worth individuals, with net assets of at least $30m, rose by 61% between 2005 and 2015 to 187,468 worldwide, according to the <a href=\"http://www.knightfrank.com/wealthreport\">latest wealth report by estate agent Knight Frank</a>. Of these, <a href=\"https://www.credit-suisse.com/ch/en/about-us/research/research-institute/global-wealth-report.html\">Credit Suisse calculates that the number worth at least $100m rose from 30,000 in 2010 to 44,900 in 2015</a>, while those with assets above $500m increased from 2,800 to 4,500 in the same period.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d562469780ac3d85f035d0dc49c5cab9df2c771a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d562469780ac3d85f035d0dc49c5cab9df2c771a/90_0_3430_2058/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Roman Abramovich\u2019s yacht Eclipse.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Roman Abramovich\u2019s yacht Eclipse.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Anadolu Agency/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Broker Simon Goldsworthy, of luxury yachting specialists Camper &amp; Nicholsons, says: \u201cThe client who 15 years ago would have been satisfied with a 40-metre [yacht], which would then have been one of the largest yachts in the bay, is now surrounded by dozens of yachts of 60-70 metres, and this plants the seed that he really ought to upgrade.\u201d</p> <p>Innovative design has also played a part \u2013 there are things you can fit onto a 60-metre yacht that you simply can\u2019t fit on to a 40-metre one, such as infinity pools, helipads, cinemas, dive rooms, and so on. Evan K Marshall, a London-based superyacht designer, says many of his clients\u2019 yachts are more expensive, and far more personalised, than their homes. \u201cWithin the circles of friends who own vessels, there is a healthy competition,\u201d he says. \u201cIf someone says: \u2018Oh, I\u2019ve just ordered an 80-metre,\u2019 his friend\u2019s going to be on the phone to his broker: \u201cListen, I\u2019m thinking of building an 85-metre!\u201d We love that.\u201d</p> <p>Among Marshall\u2019s most prolific clients is the Brooklyn automotive tycoon John Staluppi, who names his boats after James Bond films. Last year, he ordered his 19th superyacht, the 66-metre Spectre, due to be delivered by the Italian Benneti shipyards in 2017. Thompson, who was involved in many of the projects, says Staluppi gets a new superyacht every 18 months to three years, compared with a client average of every five to seven years. \u201cThe first one I did was The World is Not Enough, then he sold that and bought Quantum of Solace, then he sold that and bought Casino Royale, then Diamonds are Forever. Right now we\u2019ve got Skyfall and there\u2019s Spectre on the way. He loves the creation side of it. But he doesn\u2019t travel a lot. He uses them as floating homes.\u201d</p> <p>In the French Riviera, many owners flip between staying on board their yacht or in their luxury villas or mansions, says Spence. \u201cThey would have a fully staffed house and the boat doing exactly the same thing, 20 minutes\u2019 drive away. You\u2019d both be on call, so you wouldn\u2019t know when the owner would turn up at the house or the boat. So you would have a system that the staff at the house would call ahead to the boat, and the owners would appear 10 minutes later and you\u2019d just happen to have fresh towels and scented water waiting for them.\u201d</p> <p>In recent years, a growing number of superyacht owners and charterers, particularly those under 40, have cruised further afield than the \u201cmilk run\u201d of Mediterranean resorts to remote routes, including the Arctic Northwest Passage, fuelling demand for designer icebreakers, such as the SeaExplorer range. William Mathieson, editorial director of the Superyacht Group, says this trend for \u201cexpedition yachts\u201d is due to an emergent younger super-wealthy class \u2013 from heirs to dotcom billionaires \u2013 \u201cwho want to chase an elusive experience\u201d. Although some owners might pursue remote and exotic adventures, he suspects that for others it will become the yachting equivalent of the Chelsea tractor.</p> <p>While Spence says this trend partly reflects that yachting still involves romanticised notions of escape, it is also rooted in owners\u2019 preoccupation with bragging rights.</p> <p>She crewed on one yacht that was sailing around the world; the owners would just fly in when it reached a certain port of call. \u201cThey would leave it in the Med then fly down to Mauritius, then would fly back again when it\u2019s in India,\u201d she says. \u201cYou\u2019re really using it as a floating hotel. They would eat meals on board and pop off to do a bit of shopping.</p> <p>\u201cHaving their yacht in far-removed locations is a social statement in itself, even if they do not make it on board themselves. Even mooring your yacht on the Thames is conspicuous in that it is far removed from the south of France where all the other yachts are.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ca97e73118ecfdc51436bf140075df0f8438a503\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ca97e73118ecfdc51436bf140075df0f8438a503/0_87_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Superyachts in the harbour at Monte Carlo.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Superyachts in the harbour at Monte Carlo.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Eric Gaillard/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>The world\u2019s top five superyachts</h2> <p><strong>1.

The suspension would enable it to \u201cfocus on finding the best business model for the paper, in line with the current trends in the industry, and will start consultations in order to best secure future development,\u201d the statement added.</p> <p>But journalists dismissed the explanation as a smokescreen \u2013 pointing out that it came days after the paper disclosed corruption allegations against a minister in Orb\u00e1n\u2019s Fidesz party and a scandal embroiling the governor of the national bank.</p> <p>N\u00e9pszabads\u00e1g had also criticised last Sunday\u2019s referendum aimed at demonstrating public opposition to proposals to disperse refugees around EU member states, which overwhelmingly came out in favour of Orb\u00e1n\u2019s position but on too low a turnout to be valid.</p> <p>\u201cOf course they will try and paint this as a business decision but it\u2019s not the truth,\u201d one unnamed journalist told AFP. \u201cN\u00e9pszabads\u00e1g was the largest group of quality journalists in Hungary trying to defend basic freedoms, democracy, freedom of speech, and tolerance.\u201d</p> <p>Even the far-right Jobbik party said the suspension was driven by politics. \u201cThe total undermining of N\u00e9pszabads\u00e1g is the latest example of Viktor\u2019s Orb\u00e1n\u2019s megalomania. The only aim of Fidesz is to either gain 100% control over Hungarian media or to obstruct it,\u201d its spokesman told AP.</p> <p>Established in 1956, N\u00e9pszabads\u00e1g was controlled by the ruling communist regime until its collapse in 1989. The paper\u2019s most recent sales figures were about 40,000, down from 270,000 two decades ago.</p>",

More than 525 people were wounded.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>The Saudi-led coalition has not acknowledged responsibility for the attack, even as it announced an investigation, but is the only force with such air power in the conflict.</p> <p>The White House issued a statement saying it had begun an \u201cimmediate review\u201d of its support for Saudi Arabia in Yemen. The attack has been condemned by the UN, the European Union and the United States. </p> <p>The issue is embarrassing for the US since it has decried the Russian failure to be more open about its role in the air attack on a UN aid convoy in Syria, and it will face allegations of double standards if it allows the Saudis to delay an inquiry. </p> <p>The US, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/07/mps-poised-to-call-for-suspension-of-uk-arms-sales-to-saudi-arabia\">like the UK</a>, supplies arms to Saudi Arabia and practical military advice, even though the precise extent of that advice is disputed.</p> <p>White House national security council spokesman Ned Simon said: \u201cWe are deeply disturbed by reports of [the] airstrike on a funeral hall in Yemen, which, if confirmed, would continue the troubling series of attacks striking Yemeni civilians. US security cooperation with Saudi Arabia is not a blank cheque. </p> <p>\u201cEven as we assist Saudi Arabia regarding the defence of their territorial integrity, we have and will continue to express our serious concerns about the conflict in Yemen and how it has been waged. In light of this and other recent incidents, we have initiated an immediate review of our already significantly reduced support to the Saudi-led coalition and are prepared to adjust our support so as to better align with US principles, values and interests, including achieving an immediate and durable end to Yemen\u2019s tragic conflict.\u201d</p> <p>The UK foreign office minister Tobias Ellwood also called for the Saudis to urgently investigate. Reuters quoted Saudi officials as denying any strike and insisting its air force has clear instructions to avoid such targets. The Foreign Office has insisted UK arms export licences to Saudi Arabia do not need to be revoked since there was no serious risk of a breach of humanitarian law.</p> <p>In an unexpected twist, Islamic State claimed responsibility for the attacks even though it is thought the deaths were caused by an air raid, and Isis has no access to aircraft.</p> <p>The Saudi-led coalition issued a statement saying it was aware of reports about the \u201cregrettable and painful\u201d bombing of the Great Hall in Sana\u2019a. The coalition expressed its deepest condolences and support to the families of the victims of hostilities in Yemen since 2014.</p> <p>The statement added: \u201cThe coalition confirms that its troops have clear instructions not to target populated area and to avoid civilians. The coalition will immediately investigate this case along with Joint Incidents Assessment Team (JIAT) in Yemen.\u201d</p> <p>A call for an independent UN-led investigation into general breaches of humanitarian law in the 18-month conflict were last month fended off by Arab states at the Human Rights Council in favour of a compromise that allows the UN to advise a national inquiry.

It has faced repeated accusations that its campaign has breached international humanitarian law and last month the Guardian published data indicating that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/16/third-of-saudi-airstrikes-on-yemen-have-hit-civilian-sites-data-shows\">more than a third of the coalition\u2019s airstrikes had hit civilian sites</a> such as schools, hospitals, markets, mosques and economic infrastructure.</p> <p>The Houthi rebels are also accused of human rights violations, including the use of landmines and indiscriminate shelling. Saudi Arabia fears the Houthis are proxies for its regional rival, Iran.</p> <p>The UN has put the death toll in the war at more than 10,000, many of them civilians.

  "<p>We hear you, poor people. That was the message that blared out from Washington last week. It came from Christine Lagarde of the International Monetary Fund. It came from Jim Kim of the World Bank. It came from Roberto Azev\u00eado of the World Trade Organisation. It came from every finance minister and central bank governor.</p> <p>The people who run the global economy wanted the world to know that they understood what had <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/commentisfree/2016/jun/24/divided-britain-brexit-money-class-inequality-westminster\">caused the Brexit vote</a> and given Donald Trump a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/mar/07/donald-trump-why-americans-support\">shot at the White House</a>. They talked a lot about the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/poverty-matters/2011/mar/10/inclusive-economic-growth-involve-society\">need for inclusive growth</a> and a capitalism that worked for all. To those who have been left behind in the past three decades, they said: we get it, we feel your pain.</p> <p>The recognition that there is a problem is progress. Lagarde means it when she says the growing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jan/18/richest-62-billionaires-wealthy-half-world-population-combined\">gap between rich and poor</a> is holding back the global economy. Kim genuinely wants to see the fruits of growth skewed towards the bottom 40% in every country. The World Bank, IMF and WTO can sense that they are sitting on the edge of a volcano that could blow at any time. They fear, rightly, that a second big crash within a decade would create a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/sep/28/rein-in-protectionism-to-boost-global-growth-says-christine-lagarde-imf\">backlash leading to protectionism</a> and the rise of dark political forces that would be difficult, if not impossible, to control.</p> <p>That there are ingredients for a fresh crisis became apparent at various stages last week. According to the IMF, global debt has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/05/world-debt-has-hit-record-high-of-152tn-says-imf\">risen to a record level</a> of $152tn (\u00a3122tn) \u2013 more than double global GDP \u2013 at a time when activity is sluggish. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/apr/10/poorer-countries-commodity-slump-stronger-dollar-debt-payments\">Collapsing commodity prices</a> and weak demand from the west has meant that growth in sub-Saharan Africa is running at half the level of population increases. Companies in the emerging world loaded up on debt during the commodity boom and are vulnerable to rising US interest rates and any softening of the world economy. China is the most egregious example of debt being used to boost activity artificially.</p> <p>The argument that rising debt is fine, because on the other side of ledger is an asset increasing in value, is specious. The only reason the assets are rising in price is because investors are taking on more debt to buy them. At some point, the asset bubble bursts, leaving borrowers with a major problem. This was the lesson of the sub-prime crisis and it is remarkable that memories are so short.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/commentisfree/2016/sep/21/global-economy-2017-financial-crisis-developing-economies-oecd-unctad-guardian-view\">The next big one</a> could come from anywhere and it is good that the World Bank and IMF are aware of the risks. Even so, there was an air of unreality about the discussions in Washington last week.</p> <p>The reason was simple: there was not the slightest hint from the IMF or World Bank that the policies they advocated during the heyday of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/economics-blog/2014/oct/05/new-washington-consensus-time-fight-inequality\">so-called Washington consensus</a> \u2013 austerity, privatisation and financial liberalisation \u2013 have contributed to weak and unequal growth, with all the political discontent that this has caused.</p> <p>Even worse, Lagarde and Kim seemed oblivious to the fact that the Washington consensus approach is alive and well within their organisations. The IMF\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jul/28/imf-watchdog-criticises-handling-eurozone-crisis\">remedy for Greece and Portugal</a> during the eurozone crisis has been straight out of the structural adjustment playbook: reduce public spending, cut salaries and benefits, insist that state-owned enterprises return to the private sector, reduce minimum wages and restrict collective bargaining. Between them, the IMF and the European authorities are turning Greece into a developing country. It would be fascinating to see what sort of response Lagarde would get if she tried talking about inclusive growth to homeless people <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/gallery/2013/jun/12/homelessness-in-greece-in-pictures\">huddled on the streets</a> of Athens. </p> <p>The IMF is effectively two institutions. It has a research department that has broken with the Washington consensus and programme teams that operate in the field as if we were still in the 1990s. Lagarde sides with the research team, but the recent package prepared for Egypt was the familiar mix of subsidy reductions, the introduction of value added tax and cuts to red tape. There is not much evidence that those who put it together are on message.</p> <p>As for the World Bank, <a href=\"https://www.oxfam.org/en/research/ifc-and-tax-havens\">research by Oxfam</a> has shown that 51 of the 68 companies lent money in 2015 by its private finance arm, the International Finance Corporation, to fund investments in sub-Saharan Africa, use tax havens. That doesn\u2019t square with the idea of inclusive capitalism. It is not immediately obvious why the World Bank is supporting private schools in low-income countries when the evidence is that they exclude the poorest and, in particular, girls.</p> <p>The Jubilee Debt Campaign (JDC) has been <a href=\"http://jubileedebt.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/The-fall-and-rise-of-Ghanas-debt_10.16.pdf\">keeping a close eye </a>on Ghana, which grew strongly after oil was discovered and commodity prices were rising, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2016/jan/26/ghana-success-gold-oil-cocoa-economic-downturn\">but was left exposed</a> by the subsequent crash. More money was then borrowed to blunt the impact of the commodity price fall, but the halving of the Ghanaian currency, the cedi, meant that debt-servicing costs increased. Almost one-third of Ghana\u2019s budget is spent on external debt servicing.</p> <p>In early 2015, the IMF and World Bank said Ghana was at high risk of being unable to pay its debts. Seven months later, the World Bank guaranteed $400m of repayments on a \u00a31bn bond sold to private investors. It had to waive its rules to do so, because the World Bank is not supposed to guarantee loans to countries at high risk of distress.</p> <p>The World Bank said it was trying to help refinance expensive short-term debt and free up resources that could be used for investment, but the winners of this arrangement are the speculators getting a 10.75% return, who will make money even if Ghana can\u2019t repay the loan, due to the World Bank guarantee. The losers will be the Ghanaian people, who will be subject to austerity under the terms of a new IMF programme. Ghana is planning spending cuts by 2017 of 20% per head on 2012 levels.</p> <p>Sub-Saharan Africa is not a homogeneous region. Some countries are still growing strongly, helped by declining energy prices. But Ghana is not the only country to fall foul of the boom and bust cycle in commodities, and the JDC is highlighting the risk of a fresh debt crisis.</p> <p>Neither the World Bank nor the IMF consider this a serious threat. Kim said last week: \u201cI am not yet concerned that we\u2019re reaching a debt level crisis, certainly not in most of sub-Saharan Africa. But we have to watch it.\u201d</p> <p>The World Bank and IMF also need to be watched. There\u2019s nothing wrong with the rhetoric, but it is the performance that counts.

Ultimately we had to abandon our dream like survivors fleeing a shipwreck.</p> <p>Now, after a fallow period of about 15 years, I\u2019m back in the practice space, singing at the mic for hours, writing songs and getting ready to record and play some shows. It\u2019s exhilarating and I\u2019m learning something that I wish I\u2019d known all along: making music is better when you\u2019re not trying to get famous.</p> <p>When I was, I constantly worried about the next show, the next set of recordings, the next meeting with executives. I was stressed about not writing new songs, stressed about how much money we weren\u2019t making, stressed that the drummer was drinking up the money we did earn and stressed that the guitarist was putting the moves on the drummer\u2019s girlfriend.<br></p> <p>I was pretty much never \u201cin the moment\u201d. I remember playing in front of 6,000 people \u2013 our largest audience ever \u2013 at a music festival in Gainesville, Florida, and only for the briefest moment reveling in the electricity coming off a crowd that size before plunging back into worrying that we hadn\u2019t added any new songs to our set in nearly 10 months.</p> <p>I believed then that getting famous would solve all my problems, or at least that my problems would be a lot more exciting and interesting than not being able to pay the gas bill. </p> <p>Then, a few months after that band broke up, I got a lesson in perspective from someone famous.</p> <p>I was washing dishes in a restaurant that was partly owned by REM\u2019s lead singer, Michael Stipe. Early one morning before we opened, Stipe came in and slumped on the counter and asked if he could get a muffin and some coffee.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m having a really bad day,\u201d he said.</p> <p>I looked down at the bus tub of greasy, stinking dishes the night crew had left behind and my already damply stained apron and said, \u201cI\u2019d like to have one of your bad days, Mr Millionaire Rock Star.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDammit, David,\u201d he said in his weird, mournful speaking voice \u2013 think a whiskey barrel lined with bear fur. \u201cGetting rich and famous only solves two problems. Not being famous and not having any money. And it hands you a whole new set of problems you never knew you could have.\u201d</p> <p>I later found out that the police had arrested a pair of teenage runaways from out of state who had come to town because they believed that REM\u2019s music was speaking directly to them. They got pulled over roaming around town looking for Stipe\u2019s address and among their belongings, officers found a 12-gauge shotgun. Believing that Stipe\u2019s life might be in danger, the police had banged on his door at 3.30am, rousting him from bed.</p> <p>Within a few months I was working as a research assistant on a biography of Courtney Love, which gave me an up-close-and-personal look at how you can be famous and wealthy and still have a life that\u2019s blasted and empty.

  "<p>In the city that put America on wheels, in a state whose largest city is synonymous with automobile manufacturing, one auto company has been effectively boxed out. </p> <p>Since 2014, a Michigan law has limited Tesla Motors\u2019 capacity to sell in the state, after the Republican-led legislature implemented a statute that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/sep/22/tesla-sues-michigan-dealer-license-rick-synder\">banned the company\u2019s only method of selling its cars to consumers</a>. </p> <p>The move is part of a trend around the US to block the electric car company\u2019s direct-to-consumer sales that cut out dealerships from the sales process. The company\u2019s efforts to open its own dealership have been resisted by independent franchise dealers around the country, as well as the Big Three automakers.</p> <p>In four states, it means customers can\u2019t buy Tesla vehicles. In Michigan, even customers who own Tesla vehicles have to leave the state to get them serviced. And Tesla has beaten back attempts to block sales in several other states, with more battles likely to come, amid fears that they threaten to eliminate the middleman.</p> <p>Tesla took its strongest stance last month to challenge the prohibitions by filing a lawsuit against Michigan, a move that experts called a \u201clast resort\u201d maneuver. The lawsuit is the first to be filed by the company in federal court, following several previous legal pursuits at the state level against prohibitions of its sales model.</p> <p>\u201cThe new law was immediately recognized by the public for what it was: a highly protectionist, dealer-driven law intended to shut Tesla out of Michigan,\u201d the 24-page complaint stated.</p> <p>Tesla sells cars directly to consumers in 23 states and Washington DC. But the company says it cannot secure a license to sell its electronic vehicles in four states, including <strong> </strong>Texas, Connecticut and Utah, where it is now waging legislative and legal battles.</p> <p>The company\u2019s most high-profile battle was won in Massachusetts, where, in 2014, that state\u2019s supreme court tossed out a lawsuit by the Massachusetts State Automobile Dealers Association that sought to block Tesla sales under a <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-tesla-motors-massachusetts-lawsuit-idUSKBN0HA29620140915\">state law</a> designed to protect dealers from being undercut by manufacturers. </p> <p>It\u2019s those kinds of laws that Tesla is seeking to invalidate. The company said in a statement that \u201cgiving auto dealers a monopoly on car sales benefits them, but harms consumers\u201d. The company said that sentiment is shared by the Federal Trade Commission. Indeed, in a 2015 letter to Michigan lawmakers, <a href=\"https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/documents/advocacy_documents/ftc-staff-comment-regarding-michigan-senate-bill-268-which-would-create-limited-exception-current/150511michiganautocycle.pdf\">members of the commission said</a> they had no opinion on whether the traditional model of selling vehicles through a dealer is superior or inferior, but they believed \u201cconsumers are the ones best situated to choose for themselves both the vehicles they want to buy and how they want to buy them\u201d.</p> <p>The letter urged the Michigan legislature to abandon the prohibition of direct sales for automobiles, and \u201cinstead permit manufacturers and consumers to reengage the normal competitive process that prevails in most other industries\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cSuch a change would facilitate the development of new methods of distribution,\u201d the letter said, \u201cbenefiting the motor vehicle buyers of Michigan.\u201d</p> <p>A spokesperson for Michigan\u2019s governor, Rick Snyder, declined to comment on the lawsuit, but said the governor has previously stated he was \u201cwilling to work with Tesla in various ways within the laws of the state\u201d.</p> <p>In 2014, the top automakers\u2019 home state passed a law that amended language overseeing motor vehicle manufacturers, distributors, wholesalers and dealers, by one word: \u201cits\u201d. In doing so, Tesla says, Michigan law now requires any manufacturers to exclusively use franchised dealers \u2013 a move that directly flouted the company\u2019s sales model.</p> <p>Tesla says the traditional model of selling through a dealer doesn\u2019t jibe with the reality of a consumer\u2019s needs with electric vehicles.</p> <p>\u201cThe public remains largely unfamiliar with, and often skeptical of, electric vehicle technology,\u201d the company said in the suit. \u201cAccordingly, Tesla\u2019s retail operations are tailored to address the concerns of consumers considering the transition to electric vehicles, as well as to showcase Tesla\u2019s products and services.\u201d</p> <p>The decision to file a constitutional challenge over direct sales in federal court represents a \u201clast resort\u201d for Tesla, said Daniel Crane, a law professor at the University of Michigan who has written extensively about the company\u2019s legal battles.</p> <p>\u201cThe decision was always, when do you sort of bring out the heavy guns of the constitutional challenge,\u201d Crane said. \u201cObviously, the benefit of the constitutional challenge is you set a precedent that benefits the rest of the country.\u201d</p> <p>But if the company loses, he continued, \u201cit takes away something you might have in your back pocket that helps you with negotiations with car dealers\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cI think they were rightfully reluctant to sort of pull the trigger on the constitutional challenge until it was the last resort,\u201d he said.</p> <p>The company also says Michigan\u2019s law prevents it from opening a service facility for Tesla vehicle owners in the state. Currently, the closest service centers from Michigan are located in Cleveland and Chicago, the company says. According to the lawsuit, the state has yet to rule on the company\u2019s request for a license to service vehicles \u2013 nearly 11 months after first submitting its application.</p> <p>Crane, a staunch critic of the Michigan law and <a href=\"http://jalopnik.com/anti-tesla-bill-lands-on-michigan-governors-desk-1646720762\">how the amendment was passed by the state legislature</a>, said Tesla\u2019s suit may prove challenging as it\u2019s \u201ca matter of constitutional law\u201d and will probably turn on a federal judge\u2019s willingness to strike down a state statute.</p> <p>He continued: \u201cIf it comes down to [the state of Michigan] actually having to put down evidence to defend this thing, I\u2019m every bit skeptical they have a single good argument.\u201d</p> <p>Messages were left with Michigan\u2019s attorney general, Bill Schuette, and state secretary, Ruth Johnson, both of whom are also named as defendants, seeking comment.</p>",
  "<p>In the midnight hours leading up to the first US presidential debate, I sat up watching a rough cut of Adam Curtis\u2019s new BBC documentary, <em>HyperNormalisation</em>, on my laptop. I thought \u2013 rightly \u2013 that the film would provide a suitable preface to Trump\u2019s global horror show.</p> <p>Like all Curtis\u2019s documentary work, <em>HyperNormalisation</em> exists in a twilight between disturbing truth and restless dream. It charts an eccentric course through the choppier ideological currents of our times: the origins of Syrian apocalypse; the collapse of political middle grounds and the rise of nationalism; the meaning of Putin and Assad and the Donald himself.</p> <p>The film is the most ambitious statement of Curtis\u2019s methods and his message since his 2004 series <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dTg4qnyUGxg\" title=\"\"><em>The Power of Nightmares</em></a>, which prophetically examined the ways that western governments exploit fears of terrorism to exert control. It is based on the premise that as a culture, perhaps as a species, \u201cwe have become lost in a fake world and cannot see the reality outside\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/aug/22/adam-curtis-edinburgh-tv-festival\">Adam Curtis argues TV needs 'new tools' to tell its stories</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Curtis suggests that the trending opposites of our times \u2013 the chatter of social media and the stricture of Islamic fundamentalism \u2013 represent a retreat from complexity into an existence that constantly reflects our desires and anxieties back to us. Meanwhile, genuine power to change lives becomes more opaque and distant, leaving large parts of the world helpless and desperate. Along the way, this being Curtis, his film offers tragicomic asides on Patti Smith and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/occupy\" title=\"\">Occupy,</a> BlackRock investments and <em>The X-Files</em>.</p> <p>Critics of Curtis\u2019s films say that his jump-cut techniques and abrupt mood changes in some ways cheat on the dogged legwork of documentary journalism. As ever here, shifts in geopolitics are routinely represented by a couple of seconds of arresting footage \u2013 the banality of puppet dictators is illustrated by Colonel Gaddafi checking his hair off camera; the emergence of me-culture becomes Jane Fonda giving up on activism and donning a leotard; to explain the collapse of communism there is a punch-up in a Soviet breadline.

Curtis\u2019s films do not pretend to be definitive histories; rather they cast doubt on the possibility of that idea. They announce themselves clearly as subjective essays: \u201cThis is a story about&#xa0;\u2026\u201d is his opening mantra. His method is not only to attempt to understand the world, but to dramatise the ways we might go about understanding it. The films take the attention-deficit patterns of our 24-hour news cycle and try to impose some kind of persuasive narrative order on them \u2013 just as we try to do all the time. It is Curtis\u2019s contention that in the constant distraction of our digital lives, we miss the larger play of ideas that shape them. His aim is to give us some clues about what those forces might look like.</p> <p>The day after I watched the film, still groggy from Trump and his tax returns and Miss Universe, I had lunch with Curtis to talk about <em>HyperNormalisation</em>. As with his most recent documentary, <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/p02gyz6b/adam-curtis-bitter-lake\" title=\"\"><em>Bitter Lake</em></a>, about the postwar history of the west in Afghanistan and Saudi Arabia, this will be launched exclusively on BBC iPlayer. He insists that this apparent demotion is wholly by choice \u2013 the open-ended format gives him licence to experiment and not be constrained by hour-long episodes (the current film is nearly three hours long).</p> <p>\u201cMy editor says theoretically I can have a video that lasts up to 10 hours,\u201d he says, with some boyish excitement about the possibility. \u201cI\u2019ve done this one with chapter headings. What was lurking in the back of my brain was that it is like a novel with lots of characters and you can jump from that part to that part and trust that it is all going to come together at the end.\u201d</p> <p>The model that Curtis\u2019s films have always aspired to, he says, is that of the archetypal great American novelist, John Dos Passos, whose books he describes as \u201cthe most satisfying thing I have ever read\u201d. The novelist pioneered a technique called \u201ccamera eye\u201d which was, as it sounds, a rush of raw experience, and then spliced it with montage from newspapers and the lives of fictional characters.</p> <p>\u201cWhy I love Dos Passos is he tells political stories but at the same time he also lets you know what it feels like to live through them,\u201d Curtis says. \u201cMost journalism does not acknowledge that people live at least as much in their heads as they do in the world.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cdb3326276e182cebde893bbe5abc61d792ae8a9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cdb3326276e182cebde893bbe5abc61d792ae8a9/12_53_695_417/500.jpg\" alt=\"Footage of Colonel Gaddafi checking his hair is used as an explanation of the banality of dictators in HyperNormalisation.\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Footage of Colonel Gaddafi checking his hair is used as an explanation of the banality of dictators in HyperNormalisation.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Adam Curtis</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It is Curtis\u2019s contention that it doesn\u2019t matter if viewers get disoriented by what they see as long as they remain curious. \u201cPeople are used to spending their lives searching for meaning in a completely chaotic way,\u201d he says. \u201cInformation becomes a mosaic of questions on the internet. You search for something about whatever, Goldman Sachs, and five minutes later you are reading about a murder in Florida in the 1950s or something. You are quite happy with that.\u201d</p> <p>His films mirror that digressive quest, but loop continually back to his argument. One part of that argument is that Islamism was the unintended consequence of cold war power struggles. In this case, he traces the conflict in Syria back to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2002/apr/24/derekbrown\" title=\"\">\u201cshuttle diplomacy\u201d of Henry Kissinger</a> in 1974-75.</p> <p>\u201cKissinger\u2019s theory was that instead of having a comprehensive peace for Palestinians, which would cause specific problems, you split the Middle Eastern world and made everyone dissatisfied,\u201d he argues. In the fallout from that policy no one, his film suggests, was more dissatisfied than Hafez al-Assad of Syria.</p> <p>\u201cI wanted to try to explain Syria,\u201d Curtis says. His impression is that when we watch the footage from Aleppo the forces that have created that carnage seem all but unknown to us. This, he suggests, was deliberate. \u201cThe idea was that you couldn\u2019t deal with Assad so you created an alternative reality in which Syria had no place. As a consequence, for example, it was hardly mentioned in the books about the rise of Islamism \u2013 so to our eyes the war seems to come from nowhere.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Politics has become a pantomime in that it creates anger rather than argument\u2026 People like Trump fuel that anger</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>You could argue that all historians and journalists are conspiracy theorists of one sort or another, collecting their collages of facts and imposing some narrative sense on them. Curtis\u2019s style makes this process abundantly clear \u2013 but he still invites you to be seduced by the brilliant visual craft of his argument. In his netherworld of shifting certainties, characters \u2013 like, as he says, villains in a novel \u2013 come and go. Putin\u2019s close adviser Vladislav Surkov takes on a kind of Rasputin role in this&#xa0;respect.</p> <p>Surkov, whose previous career was as a director in avant-garde theatre, emerges, like Kissinger, as an arch manipulator of reality. \u201cSurkov will invent dissident groups and fund them,\u201d Curtis says. \u201cHe will fuel conspiracy theories, but that\u2019s not new. His particular genius has been to let people know that is what he is doing. So whatever you see in the news: you just don\u2019t know if it is \u2018true\u2019 or not. I noticed a headline in the <em>Financial Times</em> recently which said \u2018no one understands Russia\u2019s policy in Syria\u2019. I thought: Mr Surkov.\u201d</p> <p>The goal of this manipulation, Curtis suggests, is to spread a state of bewilderment and powerlessness across the globe. A sense that nothing quite makes sense. Technology, in particular social media, becomes the ally of those forces. The global technology companies not only feed a mirror of our obsessions back to us, but increasingly try to normalise our behaviour \u2013 collecting data about our health and our habits and selling us a fixed idea of who we should be and what we should like (\u201cif you liked that, you will like this\u201d). The irony of this feedback is that it is fuels prejudice and is fuelled by anger. The more angry users are, the more extreme their emotional states, the more they click, and the more money rolls into Twitter and Facebook and the rest.</p> <p>Trump is presented in the film as emblematic of this culture, certainly, but how exactly?</p> <p>\u201cMy take on Trump is that he is an inevitable creation of this unreal normal world,\u201d Curtis says. \u201cPolitics has become a pantomime or vaudeville in that it creates waves of anger rather than argument. Maybe people like Trump are successful simply because they fuel that anger, in the echo chambers of the internet.\u201d</p> <p>If Hillary Clinton gets elected next month, Curtis suggests, then the vaudeville will have played its role \u2013 the anger will have been expressed and changed nothing.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"db13d0feb456115b98abfc6a23277aaf82907f1a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/db13d0feb456115b98abfc6a23277aaf82907f1a/180_88_1069_641/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Donald Trump\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Donald Trump in footage from HyperNormalisation: fuelling anger in the echo chamber of the internet.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Adam Curtis</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But what if Trump wins? \u201cIt means the pantomime has become reality and starts rampaging around. And then we are fucked.\u201d</p> <p>What\u2019s the answer to ending or changing that pantomime?</p> <p>\u201cThere has to be a new political vision that takes account of these forces,\u201d he says. \u201cI don\u2019t know what that idea is and I don\u2019t see it as my job to provide it. My job description is to make people aware of power. To let them see the forces around them. The things they don\u2019t see.\u201d</p> <p>To this end Curtis has become a kind of heroic one-man depository of BBC memory. For the past few years he has been funding a former BBC cameraman, Phil Goodwin, to travel the world digitising all the unedited material in BBC cupboards and storerooms worldwide, the hours of rushes that got boiled down to a 20-second news report.</p> <p>Goodwin spends weeks with a bank of six laptops and six tape machines collecting it all \u2013 and then brings it back and gives it to Curtis in plastic lunch boxes full of small computer drives. \u201cSo for example I have everything the BBC has ever shot for 60 years in Russia sitting on 58 terabytes of drives,\u201d he says. \u201cPhil is doing China next. Then Egypt. Vietnam. And then we are doing Africa. I aim eventually to have the last 50 years of unedited material. I could do an emotional history of the world.\u201d</p> <p>How does he avoid just being overwhelmed by the material?</p> <p>\u201cSome of it is indexed,\u201d he says. \u201cYou have to do a bit of detective work. You just suddenly spot something. You have to intuit what people want. I think they want explanation.\u201d</p> <p>What does the BBC make of his obsessive methods?</p> <p>\u201cI made this film for \u00a330,000,\u201d he says. \u201cSo that\u2019s fine by them.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s his belief that we lack a journalism or art that can dramatise the shape of our globalised and digitalised world. \u201cDickens created these fictions that revealed the consequences of the industrial revolution, showed where the new power lay,\u201d he says. \u201cWe are waiting for new stories to come along, new ways of telling them.\u201d</p> <p>He\u2019s too modest to say so, but Curtis has himself, for 20-odd years, been feeling his way towards those new ways of telling.

  "<p>Eighteen years have passed and Gareth Farrelly has been through the wringer since, but he can still recall the \u201cweird and surreal\u201d day he kept Everton in the Premier League with vivid detail. It was the final afternoon of the 1997\u201198 season and Howard Kendall\u2019s team required at least a point against Coventry to survive. The boyhood Evertonian was not known for finding the net but he was there when his team\u2019s needs were at their greatest, scoring his only league goal for the club in a 1-1 draw to keep them up and send Bolton down.</p> <p>Yet such is the remarkable nature of Farrelly\u2019s story that the significance of that one shot, the type of moment many players would declare to be their greatest, is a minor segment. The six-times Republic of Ireland international became a manager at 28 not too long after falling out with Sam Allardyce at Bolton, whom he helped to promotion having earlier relegated them, and a couple of years later prompted a change in Fifa\u2019s transfer rules.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/25/daniel-amokachi-football-finland-too-nice-nigeria-everton\">Daniel Amokachi: \u2018Football in Finland is too nice \u2013 I want to change that\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The 41-year-old is now a trainee solicitor with Peters &amp; Peters in central London, no mean feat for someone who left school at 16 to join Aston Villa. But the most striking chapter of all was what led to his career change: surviving a condition that has a 90% mortality rate. \u201cEverybody has their own story,\u201d he says. \u201cI&#xa0;was very, very lucky.\u201d</p> <p>On 30 April 2008, his daughter\u2019s birthday, Farrelly was driving to Bournemouth to meet a friend when he took quite ill on the M40. He pulled in and began vomiting blood but was able to call an ambulance. As he battled to stay conscious, the emergency services had him at Warwick hospital in 15 minutes.</p> <p>The initial diagnosis was not promising: a lump was found and he was transferred to Coventry, where a CT scan showed an aneurysm of the splenic artery. Immediate, critical surgery was required to remove it, plus 20% of his stomach, 40% of his pancreas, part of his colon and his entire spleen.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s eight and half years ago and I still think all the time that I am part of the 10% that live,\u201d Farrelly says. \u201cI don\u2019t get up, open the curtains and smell the roses every day or anything like that but when you\u2019re having a bad day it is nice to reflect on it.\u201d</p> <p>It took nine months to fully recover, having spent the first four days post-surgery in intensive care. He lost 10kg in weight and the road back was tough but he is eternally thankful to the NHS and all the staff at Coventry\u2019s Walsgrave hospital for the \u201cimmaculate\u201d care he received.</p> <p>\u201cMy kids were incredibly young and you don\u2019t want to think about what could have happened. I met amazing people from the moment I phoned an ambulance to when I left the hospital to do my rehabilitation. I\u2019m only here because of them.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I played eight minutes football for Everton after that. I went from being a hero to playing eight minutes in 18 months</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cIt was a horrendous, difficult recovery. I sat there thinking: \u2018What if I can never play football again?\u2019 Any player will tell you that they are incredibly resilient in the face of adversity but I had to think about what I was going to do in life if I couldn\u2019t play again. I had the management experience at the time but that\u2019s now become even more competitive than before, so I thought about my interest in law.\u201d</p> <p>Farrelly completed his rehab at Preston and made a brief comeback for Sammy McIlroy at Morecambe, yet when the choice came full-time education won. His 15 years as a professional footballer were at an end, though he looks back on a tumultuous career now with nothing but fondness.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e0b0580bc0dd39586a11413b3754c6bc05431d11\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e0b0580bc0dd39586a11413b3754c6bc05431d11/0_135_1651_990/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Everton v Coventry\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Gareth Farrelly is mobbed by Everton team-mates after scoring the goal against Coventry that proved decisive in Everton\u2019s fight against the drop in 1998.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Shaun Botterill/Allsport</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>A product of the successful Home Farm academy in Dublin, Farrelly grew up as an Evertonian because \u201call my friends supported Liverpool or Manchester United, with a bit of Celtic thrown in\u201d.</p> <p>At 17 he joined Villa, who at the time were enjoying a spell of success under Brian Little, but, with game time not exactly plentiful and his heart ruling his head, he moved to Merseyside in 1997. \u201cI was coming from a situation at Villa where the team was doing very well but I had a toxic relationship with one of the coaches there. Then joining Everton, they weren\u2019t doing very well at all,\u201d he says.</p> <p>Results were poor, aside from winning four from five around Christmas, and he recalls being jeered in their penultimate home game when missing a good chance in defeat to Sheffield Wednesday. The following week Everton were battered 4-0 at Arsenal, who became champions.</p> <p>So it all led to Goodison on the final afternoon, when a defeat would send them down. \u201cIt was a weird day,\u201d Farrelly recalls. \u201cEverybody has their own particular version but, for me, what was really interesting was a couple of hours before the game, there were thousands inside and outside the ground already.</p> <p>\u201cThe women\u2019s team had won their cup and were out on the pitch beforehand. The youth team had won their cup, too, and were out there. So there was a sense of pressure for us and expectation mixed with the reality of what would happen if the day didn\u2019t go well.\u201d</p> <p>For Evertonians it must not bear thinking about. Perhaps Farrelly\u2019s greatest trait as a player was the strength of his left foot but he scored with his right after chesting down Duncan Ferguson\u2019s header just outside the penalty arc with only six minutes on the clock. Coventry would fight back and equalise late on, in effect meaning the Dubliner\u2019s strike kept Everton up at Bolton\u2019s expense.</p> <p>Kendall would still be fired, though, and the midfielder soon learned he was not part of Walter Smith\u2019s plans the following season. \u201cI played eight minutes football for Everton after that, so for me to go through such a difficult season and have an outcome like that, it shows the reality of football,\u201d he says. \u201cI went from being a hero to playing eight minutes in 18 months.\u201d</p> <p>Having sent Bolton down, Farrelly then became Allardyce\u2019s first signing, initially on loan, and was chided for having relegated his new club. But when Wanderers needed someone to stand up again, he was there, scoring the opener in the 2001 play-off final win over Preston with the same right foot and from a similar distance. Once again, however, a hurdle was not too far away. A personality clash with Allardyce spelled the end and he went on three loans in a year before an unusual offer for a 28-year-old.</p> <p>Back in Dublin, Bohemians were searching for a new manager. \u201cI got to the point where I had good managers and bad managers and had this opportunity. I had a strong plan about what I wanted to do and the irony is that I met John Giles shortly after resigning from there. If I had spoken to him before I took the job, I probably would never have done it.\u201d</p> <p>Off the pitch Bohs were having difficulties. The club had speculated hugely with their budget and failed but Farrelly did well in the circumstances despite there being \u201ca legal matter nearly every week\u201d. After that he joined Blackpool, playing only once at Bloomfield Road before returning to Ireland with Cork in February 2007.</p> <p>Inevitably there was a problem. He could not play because of Fifa\u2019s three-club rule, which meant he and his team-mate Colin Healy would have to wait until 1&#xa0;July before appearing, midway through the March-October campaign.</p> <p>That gave Farrelly another taste of the law \u2013 an appeal was turned down by the court of arbitration for sport, a week before their ban was to end. \u201cWe did the classic fighting Irish thing, put up a great argument and lost,\u201d he says. Fifa, though, was pressured into altering the rule a couple of months later.</p> <p>At the beginning of the following season he picked up a knee injury and when visiting his family, who were still living in England, during treatment the illness took hold. To compound matters Cork were placed in examinership \u2013a process in Irish law where the protection of the court is obtained to assist the survival of a company \u2013 and because of the illness he was in effect sacked and bumped down the list of creditors when it came to wages owed. He later won a case for unfair dismissal.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8353f005b2aa3702fcc00f79d712d0b31f59d29b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8353f005b2aa3702fcc00f79d712d0b31f59d29b/32_62_2092_1255/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Gareth Farrelly\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Gareth Farrelly in action for Bolton, whom he had helped to promotion in 2001, against Sunderland in 2002.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Michael Regan/Action Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Farrelly says he would not have become a solicitor were it not for the illness but initially he found a route in hard to come by. One university in Liverpool turned him away immediately before he went to Edge Hill and was placed on a fast-track course. The head of the law department, Franco Rizzuto, put him on an intense six-week programme and said if he passed there would be a place on its law degree course.</p> <p>He stuck his head in the books while playing on a noncontract basis for Morecambe. \u201cThe new season started, I was enjoying it and I was fitter than ever. Then Morecambe went to Exeter one weekend. It was a six-and-a-half-hour journey, like a transatlantic flight, and at the same time I got a letter to say I had a place on the degree. I knew I was never going to play in the Premier League or Championship again and had made peace with that.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/23/everton-idrissa-gueye-i-am-a-perfectionist\">Everton\u2019s Idrissa Gueye: \u2018I am a perfectionist.

A more standard talk would have been: \u2018Why aren\u2019t you playing me? I\u2019m better than so and so,\u2019 but instead I went in and said: \u2018Thanks for everything but I\u2019m finishing on Friday.\u2019 I started university on the following Monday.\u201d</p> <p>It is some achievement, defying popular conventions about footballers leaving education early, and while it would also be understandable for Farrelly to look back and feel some hurt about the harsh treatment he received at certain points of his career, his love for the game is still strong.</p> <p>\u201cThe most interesting thing about football for me now is that I have a nine\u2011year-old son and we\u2019ve started going to some of the games. It\u2019s nice to see his excitement.\u201d</p> <p>Everton go about it quietly but they treat their former players very well and Farrelly returns quite often. Those of a certain age are unlikely to ever forget the moment he was their saviour because without his goal things could have gone very differently.</p> <p>\u201cThe club have not been in that position since,\u201d he says. \u201cThey have gotten stronger and stronger.\u201d</p>",

  "<p>Suzanne Vega, the youthful lone voice of folkish revival in the 1980s, is now a 57-year-old woman but she remains, as she always has been, a mysteriously protean presence.

She was up for the role of the underground musician in <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtu6cLtkML8\" title=\"\"><em>Desperately Seeking Susan</em></a>, but lost out to Madonna. She got rejected as a nun in <em>Sister Act</em>, because her audition was \u201ctoo dark\u201d, and nearly played opposite Tom Cruise in <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k7gmrKAFshE\" title=\"\"><em>The Color of Money</em></a>.</p> <p>She hasn\u2019t yet landed a film role but in recent years she has acted the part of another young woman who found fame early and was hailed as a prodigious talent \u2013 the writer Carson McCullers. Five years ago Vega performed a musical stage piece she had written,<em> </em><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QjwrCJHm4Pw\" title=\"\"><em>Carson McCullers Talks About Love</em></a><em>,</em> portraying the alcoholic, disabled writer with her endlessly complex bisexual romantic interests and embittered literary rivalries. Now she has a new album out, <em>Lover, Beloved: Songs from an Evening With Carson McCullers</em>, based on the songs from that show, which she has rewritten and will be performing this week at <a href=\"http://www.suzannevega.com/tour/\" title=\"\">several venues across the UK</a>. Is it radically different from the original?</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>McCullers wrote about her characters with an acute appreciation for human diversity and vulnerability</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cThe original play was actually done when I was in college. So this is the third version. I ripped it up because I was unhappy with it. I was trying something experimental and I felt it didn\u2019t come off. This new version is more a classic one-woman show.\u201d</p> <p>Vega has been intrigued by McCullers ever since she read the short story Sucker as a teenager. Vega started out as a dancer at New York\u2019s School of Performing Arts (immortalised in <em>Fame</em>) but dropped out to study English and drama at Barnard. One day her drama tutor set a project in which students were asked to come dressed as a real person who was dead, and they had to field questions as though in a TV interview. Vega decided to read a large biography of McCullers overnight.</p> <p>\u201cI really got into it. I could act out all these things I wasn\u2019t inclined to do privately. She drank, she smoked, she apparently had all these affairs with different men and women. So I did my senior thesis on her and then put the project away for 30 years.\u201d</p> <p>In the meantime, of course, she came to prominence as the singer-songwriter of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXb6Lb_h0Oo\" title=\"\">Marlene on the Wall</a>, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZt7J0iaUD0\" title=\"\">Luka</a> and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNWyF3iSMzs\" title=\"\">Tom\u2019s Diner</a>. She arrived in the mid-1980s, aged 25, during the height of female flamboyance, when Madonna and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VdQY7BusJNU\" title=\"\">Cyndi Lauper</a> were strutting their exhibitionist stuff. By contrast she looked as if she was going for a coffee in the student union. \u201cI always felt that&#xa0;I knew myself pretty well and I&#xa0;didn\u2019t really bother with having an image,\u201d she says.</p> <p>But pop abhors a vacuum, so the image she got lumped with was of an earnest young folk singer who was too po-faced to play the game. In truth she was not immune to the pressures of success. By her third album, <em>Days of Open Hand</em>, released in 1990, she felt trapped by industry expectation.</p> <p>\u201cWe worked for a whole year on that album. In the end I wasn\u2019t really happy with it and there was this palpable sense of disappointment that we\u2019d only sold a million copies. Now that seems really ridiculous.

There is an echo here of McCullers\u2019s career, who also started out with great success, publishing her first novel, <em>The Heart Is a Lonely Hunter</em>, in 1940 at the age of 23. Although she continued to produce acclaimed works like <em>Reflections in a Golden Eye</em> and the collection <em>The Balad of the Sad Cafe</em>, she began to fall out of fashion towards the end of her career, and when she died from a brain haemorrhage at the age of 50, she had been supplanted in the public imagination by other southern writers such as Harper Lee, Truman Capote and Tennessee Williams.</p> <p>Just as Vega had started out as a dancer in New York, McCullers initially set out on a different track, studying piano at Manhattan\u2019s Juilliard School. But after developing rheumatic fever, she took up writing seriously.</p> <p>Often bracketed in the genre of southern gothic, McCullers wrote about her characters with an acute appreciation for human diversity and vulnerability. For Vega, the novelist was decades ahead of her time.</p> <p>\u201cFrom her disabilities to her bisexuality, what she called her dual nature, she was so modern. She was interested in writing from the point of view of black people. And she embodied these things. It wasn\u2019t just \u2018Oh I think I\u2019ll write about civil rights\u2019. She was deep in everything she wrote, and I think she suffered from it too.\u201d</p> <p>Like her heroine, Vega also has a gift for narrative empathy. Her songs often feature characters that feel novelistic in their realisation. After all, Luka was about the abuse of a young boy. At her best she brings to bear formidable powers of writerly observation, which may have something to do with a slight outsider\u2019s perspective developed in her unorthodox cross-cultural upbringing.</p> <p>Vega grew up in the Latino neighbourhood of East Harlem in New York and until she was nine years old, she believed that her stepfather, the Puerto Rican writer Ed Vega, was her father.</p> <p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know my real father at all,\u201d&#xa0;she says. \u201cIt was a huge shock and&#xa0;very embarrassing. All kinds of issues came up, mostly of identity. Because I was raised to be a proud half-Puerto Rican girl, and I loved my grandmother and aunt and I\u2019d been to Puerto Rico, and I spoke Spanish and ate Puerto Rican food. And suddenly to&#xa0;be told that I was not Puerto Rican at&#xa0;all, that I was white!\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEvjFThqmq0\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/uEvjFThqmq0?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEvjFThqmq0\">Watch the video for <em>99.9</em> F\u00b0 by Suzanne Vega.</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>In her teens and early 20s, when she was reading a lot of revolutionary writers, she felt uncomfortable with her ethnic status. \u201cIt\u2019s taken me a while to say \u2018You are what you are, it\u2019s fine\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>She didn\u2019t meet her biological father, Richard Peck, until she was in her late 20s, after she had gained international recognition. She says they have been in each other\u2019s lives ever since and that he\u2019s been very understanding of her sense of dislocation, having been an adopted child himself.</p> <p>For the past 10 years she has been married to a lawyer called Paul Mills, and she has a 22-year-old daughter from a previous marriage to the musician and record producer Mitchell Froom.</p> <p>If her own personal life is pretty stable, that wasn\u2019t the case with McCullers. She married a soldier and wannabe writer, Reeves McCullers, when she was just 20, and thereafter suffered a torturous relationship based on that familiar but unhealthy dynamic of not being able to live together, and not being able to be apart.</p> <p>It ended 16 years later, after various splits and reconciliations, a divorce and remarriage, with Reeves killing himself in what he hoped, mistakenly, would be a double suicide pact with his wife.</p> <p>\u201cThey were almost always out of control,\u201d says Vega, \u201cbut they really sort of needed each other. She took his name, but he kept trying to take bits of her identity, forging her cheques and professing to have all this writing talent himself, though he never put anything on the page.\u201d</p> <p>There were rumours, the kind often associated with successful women, that it was Reeves, who was the real author of the work. Vega knows the syndrome well. Her first husband produced her fourth album, which marked a significant shift towards a more electronic style of music. At the time there were suggestions that Froom drove the change.</p> <p>\u201cThere was a camp of people who said, \u2018Oh she changed her style to suit her husband\u2019, which is nonsense. I hired him to do the thing that he did, and he did it really well, and that\u2019s what I wanted him to do.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>McCullers wrote about police brutality very early. The things that she was thinking of, and embodied, are very current</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>But while McCullers was the obvious author of her own work, Vega believes her writing lost something when Reeves died, some of its earlier passion and social vision. What McCullers never lost, and Vega makes gentle fun of in one song entitled Harper Lee, is her competitive spirit. The song runs through McCullers\u2019s opinions of other writers \u2013 \u201cVirginia Woolf/She leaves me cold/I recognise the genius/But I\u2019m twice as bold\u201d \u2013 and boasts the catchy chorus: \u201cOh, Harper, Harper./Lee. Lee. Lee./She only wrote that one book!/I\u2019ve written more than three.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShe was trained by her mother to be a genius,\u201d Vega says of McCuller\u2019s motivation. \u201cSo you get the sense if you\u2019re not a great genius maybe your mother won\u2019t love you. She wasn\u2019t going to let that go, and if that wrecked your marriage, well then that\u2019s just too bad.\u201d</p> <p>I ask her if she feels competitive with other musicians.</p> <p>\u201cYes,\u201d she says without prevarication. \u201cI have a jealous streak. I\u2019m jealous of other people\u2019s success, their acclaim, their recognition I guess. But over the years I\u2019ve had to say, you just have to put that away. What I\u2019m not jealous of is people\u2019s freedoms. Because I\u2019ve done what I\u2019ve wanted. So I don\u2019t begrudge anybody\u2019s art. But sometimes I say, \u2018Oh, they\u2019re not up to much.\u2019 I have to wrestle with that, though, because ultimately it will poison your art.\u201d</p> <p>A former Orange prize judge, she says she doesn\u2019t read much modern fiction, preferring classics like Edith Wharton, Charles Dickens, the Bront\u00ebs, James Joyce and Hemingway. The most up-to-the-moment novel she has read recently is 25 years old \u2013 Brett Easton Ellis\u2019s <em>American Psycho</em>, which she didn\u2019t finish first time round. She appreciated the satire much more this time.</p> <p>But what she really loves are biographies, particularly of creative people. Although she\u2019s very careful about maintaining the privacy of her own life, she\u2019s not one of those artists who argue that it\u2019s all about the work. For her, it\u2019s knowledge of the life that enhances appreciation of the work.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uAWGw8meEDE\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/uAWGw8meEDE?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uAWGw8meEDE\">Watch the video for Book of Dreams by Suzanne Vega.</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>\u201cSay <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/bacon\" title=\"\">Francis Bacon</a>,\u201d she explains. \u201cYou see his work on the canvas, but it\u2019s so much more enriching when you know some of them are his lovers and this is how he lived. This is what his room looked like.\u201d</p> <p>I say it\u2019s notable that Bacon, like McCullers, led a chaotic, alcoholic life.</p> <p>\u201cI think that\u2019s why you become an artist,\u201d she says, \u201cto clear all that out. You have this troubled life and you figure, where am I going to put all this? And you put it on the canvas or the page as overspill in a way.\u201d</p> <p>What survives from that overspill is entirely unpredictable. I tell her that on the way to the interview, I suddenly found myself humming the insanely catchy melody to Tom\u2019s Diner, and having to remind myself to stop, in case she thought I was mocking her.</p> <p>She laughs, but she\u2019s grown used to its background ubiquity. She wrote the song in 1982 and it lay dormant for five years, before becoming a huge global hit. Since then it has been covered, sampled and resampled by everyone from <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ci7NhvYeXEk\" title=\"\">REM</a> to <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vcKIXpyvTAI\" title=\"\">Snoop Dogg</a>.</p> <p>As for McCullers\u2019s legacy, Vega would like to see her read more widely. Her work, she says, is growing more relevant by the day.</p> <p>\u201cEven in the last five years between the last production [of her McCullers show] and this one, so much has changed. The fact that gay people can marry each other now is an amazing leap forward. And that, sadly, we have to have <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/blacklivesmatter?lang=en-gb\" title=\"\">Black Lives Matter</a> \u2013 that [campaign] would be shocking to her. She wrote about police brutality very early in her career. The things that she was thinking of, and embodied, are very current. So I think there\u2019s a whole generation of people who might find in her a kindred spirit. They just don\u2019t know.\u201d</p> <p>Perhaps, with Vega\u2019s help, they will soon.</p> <p><em>Suzanne Vega performs Lover, Beloved at the </em><a href=\"http://www.thequeenshall.net/whats-on/shows/suzanne-vega-the-lover-beloved-tour-2016\" title=\"\"><em>Queens Hall Edinburgh</em></a><em> (9 Oct), </em><a href=\"http://www.rncm.ac.uk/performance/suzanne-vega/\" title=\"\"><em>RNCM Manchester</em></a><em> (10 Oct), </em><a href=\"https://www.cadoganhall.com/event/suzanne-vega-161011/\" title=\"\"><em>Cadogan Hall</em></a><em> London (11 Oct) and the </em><a href=\"https://www.thsh.co.uk/event/suzanne-vega-the-lover-beloved-tour\" title=\"\"><em>Town Hall Birmingham</em></a><em> (13 Oct).

  "<p>Texas native Andrew Savage formed post-punk band <a href=\"https://parquetcourts.wordpress.com/\" title=\"\">Parquet Courts</a> in Brooklyn in 2010 with fellow singer-songwriter-guitarist Austin Brown; the pair met at record-listening club the Knights of the Round Turntable while at the University of North Texas. Parquet Courts released their debut, <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/parkay-quarts/parquet-courts-american\" title=\"\"><em>American Specialties</em></a> \u2013 described by Savage as \u201cthe Fall meets Neil Young\u201d \u2013 in cassette-only format in 2011.

It is endearingly fragmented; a patchwork of confessional, deeply personal writing spliced with to-do lists, bills and personal memos. The text is formatted to resemble the way it appears on the pages of Hesse\u2019s notebooks, a nice detail that lends a poetic quality to each entry. Through its pages, Hesse struggles with anxieties related to academia, romance and the art world, as well as the suicide of her mother during her childhood. For me, it\u2019s a reminder that even a truly great, canonised artist faced her share of doubt and confusion, as we all should for something that means the world to us.</p> <h2>2 | Album</h2> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/apr/17/cate-le-bon-crab-day-review\" title=\"\"><strong>Crab Day by Cate Le Bon (Drag City)</strong></a></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"072c3a51ce81a9e0fee86211055816b250ef0196\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/072c3a51ce81a9e0fee86211055816b250ef0196/0_233_1250_750/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Cate Le Bon.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Cate Le Bon.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Turnstile Records</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Cate Le Bon\u2019s songwriting is some of the most exciting around at the moment. <em>Crab Day</em> has the kind of songs that begin as somewhat conventional and recognisable structures, but then, in a very thrilling way, go to a place that is completely unexpected. As a lyricist, she addresses profound emotion with abandon, and her nonchalant syntax belies how urgent and personal her words really are. As a player, I feel like a 12-year-old boy listening to Hendrix in my bedroom, holding my guitar and trying to unlock the puzzle of her phrasing. I still haven\u2019t filed away this LP, because it\u2019s on such frequent rotation at my house.</p> <h2>3 | Gallery</h2> <p><a href=\"https://www.chinati.org/collection/johnwesley\" title=\"\"><strong>The John Wesley Gallery at the Chinati&#xa0;Foundation</strong></a></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"54c387dcd0d2a0ba5c581c843ba74ad04b26475e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/54c387dcd0d2a0ba5c581c843ba74ad04b26475e/29_10_719_601/500.jpg\" alt=\"Captives (1966) by John Wesley.\" width=\"500\" height=\"418\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Captives (1966) by John Wesley.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy the artist &amp; Chinati Foundation</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Recently I spent my birthday in Marfa, Texas, a place I find quite alluring and odd.

I admire so many things about his work, from the technical \u2013 the broad fields of sparse, harmonious colour, the fluidity of his line \u2013 to the conceptual. I used the opportunity to study Wesley\u2019s craft, and to meditate on the rhythm of his shapes.

Nobody I went to school with liked the show, but that didn\u2019t matter. In fact it was all the better because it opened a door to a type of shameless silliness I found sorely deficient in my life. All the vignettes, which satirise social norms and embrace all things taboo, collide in the final scene of each episode.I\u2019ve never seen such a daring and conceptual sketch show since.</p> <h2>5 | Food</h2> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/texmex\" title=\"\"><strong>Tex-Mex</strong></a></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a00d85e87a08e85ed2efe2c1a87cb7b07243dd70\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a00d85e87a08e85ed2efe2c1a87cb7b07243dd70/0_208_5184_3110/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tacos filled with migas.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tacos filled with migas.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Leigh Anne Meeks/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Some woefully misinformed people consider Tex-Mex to be a corruption of Mexican food rather than a glorious hybrid&#xa0;cuisine influenced by indigenous tradition, war, immigration and limited resources.

  "<p>In a fractured and fractious world, diplomacy \u2013 or at least tact deployed so that one may get one\u2019s way \u2013 is a vital tool. As with greatness, some men are born to it, some achieve it, and some have it thrust upon them: others, like the footballer Joey Barton, appear to have decided to dispense with it altogether. Here he is, resolved to confront his manager at Queens Park Rangers, Harry Redknapp, about the team\u2019s terrible form:</p> <p>\u201cHe was watching the Racing Channel, and it was pointless hedging my bets.</p> <p>\u201c\u2018Gaffer, I need to speak with you.

His combative personality has caused him problems at all his clubs, from Manchester City to Newcastle United, where he called caretaker manager Alan Shearer a cheat and accused him of wanting to surround himself with sycophants, to Glasgow Rangers, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/19/joey-barton-believes-remain-rangers-talks-mark-warburton\" title=\"\">where he is nearing the end of a suspension</a> for rowing with a team-mate following a 5-1 tonking in an Old Firm match.

Barton\u2019s exploration of his childhood, which, despite close relationships with many family members and particularly his grandmother, was permeated with violence, will be rejected by his detractors as the search for an excuse. But killing and GBH were all around him; his brother Michael and a cousin are serving jail sentences for the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder_of_Anthony_Walker\" title=\"\">racist murder of 18-year-old Anthony Walker</a> in 2005. After the pair fled the country, Barton appealed to them to return and give themselves up but, he says, he still continually asks himself whether he could have done anything \u2013 presumably by exerting greater influence on them \u2013 to prevent the murder.</p> <p>Swagger though he might, those experiences have clearly marked him. But there is still humour. When Barton joined the England squad in 2007 to gain his one senior cap, he was greeted with a certain amount of frostiness by those of his new team-mates who had published autobiographies following a shabby showing in the previous year\u2019s World Cup; Barton lampooned their efforts as \u201cWe got beat in the quarter-finals. I played like shit. Here\u2019s my book.\u201d It is to Barton\u2019s credit that he captions a photograph of himself training with \u201cmy fellow authors, Steven Gerrard and Frank Lampard\u201d.

The meeting broke up without reaching an answer.</p> <p>Experts contacted by the Guardian said that with exactly one month until election day and early voting having let hundreds of thousands of Americans make their choice already, replacing or removing Trump is implausible \u2013 but not impossible. </p> <p>\u201cThis is mass suicide any way you cut it,\u201d said Jim Bopp, a prominent conservative lawyer. However, he said, RNC guidelines authorize members \u201cto fill any and all vacancies which may occur by reason of death, declination, or otherwise of the Republican candidate for president\u201d.</p> <p>That in effect means that to be replaced as nominee, Trump would either have to die, be found to be incapacitated or voluntarily step down. </p> <p>Trump frequently boasts about his good health and stamina.

Experts, however, seem to agree the language of the RNC rules only allows the party to \u201cfill\u201d a vacancy, not \u201ccreate\u201d one.</p> <p>If Republicans tried to change the rules now, Bopp said, it would probably incite \u201cchaos\u201d and further inflame Trump supporters, many of whom wholeheartedly believe the political system is \u201crigged\u201d against them and their candidate. </p> <p>\u201cThere is no authority in the RNC rules to remove a candidate for president or his vice-president,\u201d Bopp said. \u201cThere is only the authority if a vacancy arose \u2013 then they have the authority to fill that vacancy.\u201d</p> <p>Vikram Amar, dean and Iwan Foundation professor of law at the University of Illinois College of Law, discussed a largely fantastical scenario in which Trump could remain at the top of the ticket but pledge to declare himself incapacitated and allow Pence to take over as president if their ticket prevails. </p> <p>\u201cUnder the 25th amendment, the president can declare [him or herself] disabled,\u201d Amar said. \u201cIn that case, technically Trump would be president and Pence would be acting president with the full authority to exercise all of the powers and duties of the president.\u201d</p> <p>Amar said this would be the least disruptive option for the RNC to pursue, because it would not require attempts to change the nominee after ballots in many states have been printed. Trump, he added, would be bound by his word if he promised Republicans he would step down and allow Pence to take over after winning the White House. </p> <p>Regardless of whether Trump withdraws, Rick Hasen, a University of California-Irvine professor who runs the Election Law Blog, said Republicans had one <a href=\"http://electionlawblog.org/?p=87310\">\u201cHail Mary</a>\u201d pass left: the electoral college. </p> <p>Writing on the blog, Hasen said: \u201cWhen we cast our votes for president they are actually cast for electors from each state (based roughly on population size) who then cast ballots for president. If Trump is chosen in some states, those electors could vote for Pence, or Romney, or Kasich, or whoever.\u201d </p> <p>There are laws that bar \u201cfaithless\u201d electors from voting for a candidate who did not win the popular vote in their state, but Hasen argues that in the event of a Trump victory, neither the Republican-controlled Senate nor the courts would be likely to object.</p> <p>That scenario, however, would also require an extraordinary confluence of events that look increasingly hard to pull off, including Trump withdrawing or the party abandoning him, electors placing faithless votes and Hillary Clinton earning fewer electoral college votes than Trump. </p> <p>\u201cAll of this is possible, but not bloody likely,\u201d Hasen wrote.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/08/donald-trump-list-of-republicans-reject-support-endorsement\">The growing list of Republicans abandoning Donald Trump</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Ultimately, RNC officials appear reluctant to engage with any suggestion that Trump be removed from the ticket.

  "<p>Every few weeks, William Johnson, the chairman of the white nationalist <a href=\"http://theamericanfreedomparty.us/\">American Freedom Party (AFP)</a>, holds a lunch for members, the goal being to make America a white ethnostate, a project that begins with electing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump\">Donald Trump</a>. This week, it\u2019s at a grand old French restaurant called <a href=\"http://taixfrench.com/\">Taix, in Echo Park, Los Angeles</a> \u2013 an odd choice on the face of it. Echo Park is a trendy hood. It\u2019s hipster and heavily Hispanic. In fact, given the predominance of Latino kitchen staff in this city, it may be wise to hold off on the Trump talk until the food arrives.</p> <p>\u201cAbout three months ago,\u201d Johnson begins, \u201cI was talking to Richard Spencer about how we need to plan for a Trump victory.\u201d Spencer is another prominent white nationalist \u2013 he heads the generic-sounding National Policy Institute. \u201cI said: \u2018I want Jared Taylor [of <a href=\"http://www.amren.com/\">American Renaissance</a>] as UN Ambassador, and Kevin MacDonald [an evolutionary psychologist] as secretary of health and <a href=\"http://www.anncoulter.com/\">Ann Coulter</a> as homeland security!\u2019 And Spencer said: \u2018Oh Johnson, that\u2019s a pipe dream!\u2019 But today, he\u2019d no longer say that, because if Trump wins, all the establishment Republicans, they\u2019re gone\u2026 They hate him! So who\u2019s left? If we can lobby, we can put our people in there.\u201d</p> <p>Around the table five young men, roughly half Johnson\u2019s age (he\u2019s 61), nod and lean in. They all wear suits and ties, address the waiter as \u201csir\u201d and identify as the \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/23/alt-right-movement-white-identity-breitbart-donald-trump\">alt right</a>\u201d, the much-discussed <em>nouvelle vague</em> of racism. \u201cAre you guys familiar with the <em>Plum Book</em>?\u201d Johnson asks. \u201cIt\u2019s plum because of the colour, but also because of the plum positions \u2013 there are 20,000 jobs in that book that are open to a new administration.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSo we need to identify our top people!\u201d says Eric, one of the men at the table.</p> <p>\u201cJust anyone with a college degree!\u201d Johnson says.</p> <p>\u201cRight.\u201d Eric is practically bouncing in his seat with excitement. \u201cWe need to get the word out. We are the new GOP!\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5a0a17d4143bd1b8a38a14783839d95fdc562efd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5a0a17d4143bd1b8a38a14783839d95fdc562efd/0_356_5339_3203/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A whiter future: pro- and anti-Trump supporters clash outside Trump Towers in New York.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A whiter future: pro- and anti-Trump supporters clash outside Trump Towers in New York.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy Stock Photo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It\u2019s not every day that a brown journalist gets to sit in on a white-nationalist strategy meeting. But these are strange times. Racism is trending. Like Brexit, Trump has normalised views that were once beyond the pale, and groups like the AFP have grown bold. Their man\u2019s stubby orange fingers are within reach of actual power, so maybe it\u2019s time to emerge from the shadows at last.</p> <p>I first met Johnson in May after he signed up as a Trump delegate before being swiftly struck off by the campaign when the press found out. He\u2019s a surprising figure. An avid environmentalist, fluent in Japanese and, in person, not the bitter old racist I\u2019d expected but rather a jolly Mormon grandfather, bright eyed and chuckling, a <em>Wind in the Willows </em>character. Eric is even more unexpected. Tall and impassioned, he came to racism via hypnotherapy, of all things. He sells solar panels for a living and practises yoga. Together with his friends Matt and Nathan, who are also here at lunch, he runs an alt-right fraternity in Manhattan Beach \u2013 \u201ca beer and barbecues thing\u201d. They\u2019re called the Beach Goys. \u201cWe\u2019re starting a parody band,\u201d he beams. \u201cWe\u2019ve found a drummer!\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Trump has made views that were once beyond the pale acceptable. People are starting to emerge from the shadows</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Between them they represent two poles of a racist spectrum, young and old. And judging from this lunch, it\u2019s the millennials who are the more extreme. Johnson wants white nationalists to appear less mean and he finds the \u201cJQ\u201d, the Jewish Question, archaic. But Eric loves the meanness of the alt right. \u201cWe\u2019re the troll army!\u201d he says. \u201cWe\u2019re here to win. We\u2019re savage!\u201d And antisemitism is non-negotiable. In fact, he\u2019d like to clear up a misnomer about the alt right, propagated by the <a href=\"http://www.breitbart.com/\">Breitbart</a> columnist <a href=\"http://www.breitbart.com/author/milo-yiannopoulos/\">Milo Yiannopoulos</a>, who is often described, mistakenly, as the movement\u2019s leader. Milo casts the alt right as principally a trolling enterprise, dedicated to attacking liberal shibboleths for the \u201clulz\u201d\u2013 there\u2019s precious little actual bigotry. But Eric insists otherwise. Yes, they like to joke, they have memes, they\u2019re just as funny as liberals \u2013 have I heard of their satirical news podcasts, the <em>Daily Shoah</em> and <em>Fash the Nation</em>? But make no mistake, the racism is real. Eric especially enjoys <em>The Daily Stormer</em>, a leading alt-right news site, which is unashamedly pro-Hitler.</p> <p>What unites Johnson and Eric is what they describe as \u201cthe systematic browbeating of the white male\u201d \u2013 namely all this talk of privilege, the Confederate flag, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/black-lives-matter-movement\">Black Lives Matter</a> and mansplaining. But beyond that, it\u2019s the \u201clooming extinction of the white race\u201d. This is the language they use. Also: \u201cDiversity equals white genocide.\u201d The alt right loves to evoke genocide while harbouring Holocaust deniers. Their point is that white people are melting away like the icecaps, and they have a primal drive to stop it. In 2044, non-Hispanic whites will drop below 50% of the US population. \u201cThe generation of the white minority has already been born,\u201d Eric says. \u201cLook at South Africa and Rhodesia. That\u2019s where we\u2019re headed. Total disenfranchisement.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0f1d2682565a4ad3d9d7054da9b3ebbcf2fcf171\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0f1d2682565a4ad3d9d7054da9b3ebbcf2fcf171/0_155_4449_2670/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Mexican activists on the campaign trail.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mexican activists on the campaign trail.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy Stock Photo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I want to reassure him that his Brown Rulers will be gentle and that slavery isn\u2019t so bad when you get used to it. But it\u2019s not me they want to hear from, it\u2019s white people. This is the white nationalist\u2019s burden \u2013 the very people they\u2019re trying to save are the ones who most fiercely oppose them. \u201cThe only group I cannot get along with is white people,\u201d says Johnson. \u201cBecause white people hate white people who like white people.\u201d</p> <p>A couple of days later, Johnson is at his cluttered desk in downtown LA, nattering merrily in Japanese to a woman in Tokyo. He gets lots of media requests these days, but especially from Japan. There\u2019s an uncanny connection between Japan and white nationalism in America. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/26/jared-taylor-alt-right-clinton-trump\">Jared Taylor</a>, white nationalism\u2019s foremost intellectual, is another fluent speaker. \u201cIt\u2019s an ethnostate and it\u2019s deeply nationalist,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd they have resisted the pressure to admit refugees. I say: \u2018God bless them!\u2019\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Diversity equals white genocide. Look at South Africa and Rhodesia. That\u2019s where we\u2019re headed</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>For his part, Johnson\u2019s racism was shaped in Japan. He grew up in Eugene, Oregon, a state founded as a white utopia, in a modest Mormon home, back before the LDS church gave black people the priesthood in 1978. But it was his two-year mission to Tohoku, Japan, that turned him. As he went from door to door, locals would opine on the greatness of white America. \u201cThey had an inferiority complex after the war, so we were treated like celebrities,\u201d he says. \u201cOh, it was just the funnest time!\u201d A few years later, while working in Japan as an attorney, he wrote a book advocating the repatriation of all non-whites with appropriate reparations, because \u201cI thought America was going to collapse unless I did something.\u201d When he returned to LA, he sent a copy to every congressman. He was 32.</p> <p>Clearly things didn\u2019t work out as planned. His forays into politics floundered and then his offices were bombed. So he retreated from activism for nearly 15 years, only returning in 2009 to form the AFP \u2013 just in time for the rise of the alt right.</p> <p>We head to his 67-acre ranch near Pasadena, a hilly lot backing on to a national forest. I asked to meet his family, but his wife refused, so we tour the farm instead \u2013 his persimmon orchard, his horses and ducks. And there on his pick-up truck is a stencil of Jimi Hendrix. \u201cMy daughter likes to paint,\u201d he says proudly. None of his five children are white nationalists, though they have promised to marry within the race.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re a white supremacist with a black artist painted on your truck,\u201d I tell him. And he flinches. \u201cThat\u2019s the meanest, most hurtful swearword there is. Just because I say different races have different strengths doesn\u2019t mean I think I\u2019m superior.\u201d He doesn\u2019t like \u201cracist\u201d either. \u201cIt\u2019s a pejorative. I prefer \u2018race realist\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut it\u2019s not my reality, Bill. I\u2019m sticking with racist.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWell, OK. But people who embrace \u2018racist\u2019 are mad at everybody. I get along with people.

He clears space on the table and grins. \u201cOK, you ready? Your first tarot card reading with the Hitler Youth!\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s been an odd afternoon. We walked along the beach and I asked about his gmail address which includes the number 1488, a potent number for white supremacists. The \u201c14\u201d stands for the 14 words coined by the late <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Lane_(white_supremacist)\">David Lane</a> of the group The Order: \u201cWe must secure the existence of our people and a future for white children.\u201d And the 88 refers to HH (H being eighth in the alphabet) \u2013 or Heil Hitler. Eric sighed. \u201cOK, but this stuff\u2019s hard to talk about,\u201d he said. \u201cIt depends how red-pilled you are.\u201d</p> <p>Alt-righters love talking about the red pill. It\u2019s a reference to <em>The Matrix \u2013</em> blue-pilled people bumble through a life of illusion, while the red-pilled have seen the truth and there\u2019s no turning back. Like all conspiracy theorists they see the hidden hand that guides all things, but for the alt right that hand is Jewish. The red pill is classic antisemitism, rebooted for a younger generation. As we walked, he laid it out \u2013 the banking, the media, the globalism. We passed games of beach volleyball and family picnics, while he explained why the Holocaust was exaggerated and Hitler got a bad rap.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a905e082e557b41591135e5795566c07bbfa90e5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a905e082e557b41591135e5795566c07bbfa90e5/397_207_1455_873/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A nation without colour: William Johnson speaking at an AFP conference in 2013.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A nation without colour: William Johnson speaking at an AFP conference in 2013.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: You tube</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cHave you noticed that <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kombucha\">kombucha</a> isn\u2019t as fizzy as it used to be?\u201d he asks, along the way, because Eric isn\u2019t your average Nazi. He trained as a spiritualist. He has taught meditation. He brought his tarot cards in case I wanted a reading.</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t tell me \u2013 it\u2019s the Jews,\u201d I tell him.

Mark Potok of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/feb/17/southern-poverty-law-center-hate-speech-report-donald-trump\">Southern Poverty Law Center</a> describes the alt right in similar terms, as Racism 2.0, \u201ca rebranding for the digital generation\u201d. It\u2019s a trendy reboot \u2013 \u201calt right\u201d makes white supremacy sound like an art collective. And Eric, the kombucha Nazi, just takes it a step further \u2013 into the aisles of Whole Foods. He\u2019s a locally sourced, wild-caught bigot high in omega-3s and antisemitism. It makes him more sinister in some ways, and more harmless in others. As Nazis go.</p> <p>\u201cHmm, Nazi.\u201d Like Johnson, he\u2019s squeamish about terms. Warriors against political correctness can be awfully sensitive. \u201cIt\u2019s such a slur,\u201d he says. But come on \u2013 he\u2019s a Hitler apologist. \u201cOK, fine,\u201d he says. \u201cJust don\u2019t say I\u2019m a Buddhist, because I\u2019m actually more into Norse and Celtic mysticism now.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019ll come as no surprise that someone who\u2019d rather be called a Nazi than a Buddhist has a strange story to tell. Originally from a well-off white suburb of Chicago, he moved to Las Vegas to pursue music. Then one day, in the gym of his condo building, he met a guru figure we\u2019ll call Frank. A spiritualist and businessman, Frank introduced Eric to New Age mysticism and Japanese Buddhism. And it was under Frank\u2019s guidance that Eric moved to LA to study hypnotherapy and began a career giving readings and tarot shows at a psychic bookshop. Frank, he says, was his \u201cmentor and best friend\u201d. But then Eric took a turn. He radicalised himself. He left the New Age life, finding it too feminine, and spiralled down a sinkhole of conspiracy theory. He and Frank have been estranged ever since. Frank is black.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a18ed80ab7a66182407b818c08dda04dca0d55c1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a18ed80ab7a66182407b818c08dda04dca0d55c1/45_0_2910_1747/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Author Ann Coulter.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">By the book: author Ann Coulter.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Aaron Davidson/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Today, Eric still meditates and practises yoga. His weeks are spent like David Brent, as a travelling salesman, driving around meeting his solar energy clients. His weekends, however, are all about the Beach Goys, which now has 15 members. Last week, they went on a hike to the Murphy Ranch in the Pacific Palisades, a decrepit old property that was originally built as a refuge for Hitler after the war. Next week is their first band rehearsal. Eric\u2019s going to play guitar and sing. And this is the future he wants \u2013 not a plum job with the Trump administration. \u201cI don\u2019t see myself as a bureaucrat,\u201d he says. \u201cI want to take the Beach Goys national. I want to inspire people.\u201d</p> <p>It could happen. Trump has unleashed something in America. Johnson won\u2019t reveal the AFP\u2019s membership numbers \u2013 \u201cMaybe we want to appear bigger than we are?\u201d \u2013 but Eric insists the alt right is on the march. \u201cWe\u2019re growing with every hashtag, every BLM protest, every city that becomes a Detroit, or a London,\u201d he says. \u201cWe\u2019re everywhere! We\u2019re the guy next to you at yoga, the barista at Starbucks...\u201d It\u2019s like <em>Fight Club</em> for supremacists, a deeply unsettling thought (which is why Eric loves it).</p> <p>But his delight in being a secret Nazi detracts from the seriousness of it all, the white genocide stuff. He\u2019s having too much fun. And I wonder, as we finish our beers, if it will pass for Eric, this Nazi phase. He just doesn\u2019t seem that threatening. Then he starts up about a race war, that old white-supremacist chestnut. Because behind the trolling veneer, the alt right is more traditional than alt. What Eric believes is vintage racism, the same old wine in a new ironic cask. And Tony Benn\u2019s words ring as true as ever: \u201cEvery generation must fight the same battles again and again.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOur civilisation is at war and we need to secure our people,\u201d Eric says. \u201cWe must seize power and take control. And the idea that we can do this peacefully is probably not realistic.\u201d</p> <p>We get along well enough, Eric and I, but he has the same micro/macro discrepancy as Johnson. And at a macro level, there is only despair and division. \u201cI do not advocate violence, but I will give my life for my blood\u2026 and for the honour of my ancestors.\u201d</p> <p>He thrums the tarot cards in his hands, his voice getting more animated. \u201cWe accept the game that\u2019s being played. We accept that the lion and the gazelle are competition. But they don\u2019t have to hate each other. That\u2019s just how we view it.\u201d</p> <p>He shrugs. \u201cIt\u2019s scary.

  "<p>It isn\u2019t an easy subject. It is, however, an important one, and perhaps the best place to start when it comes to the issue of safe standing is to look at the number of countries who have already had the debate and concluded that if it can change football for the better then there is nothing to be afraid of.</p> <p>It is the creation of a safe-standing section that helps to explain why watching football at Celtic Park can have the same effect as standing next to the speakers at an Iron Maiden concert. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/david-conn-inside-sport-blog/2012/dec/02/ermany-bundesliga-noisy-fans\" title=\"\">Germany has led the way</a> and, one by one, the other leagues are following behind. Austria, Switzerland, Hungary, Belgium, Norway, Sweden, Denmark and the Netherlands all now operate safe standing. Australia is bringing it in. Various grounds in the United States have put it in place. Even Russia, a football environment that sometimes feels like stepping back into the 1980s, has gone for the modern option. CSKA Moscow have safe-standing areas, featuring rail seats, behind both goals in their new stadium, the Arena CSKA.</p> <p>It is also apparent that the majority of Premier League clubs like the idea. Tottenham Hotspur, Crystal Palace, Sunderland, Swansea City, Burnley, Hull City and Watford are all actively pushing for safe standing, and it is commonly known that many others think it is time the league\u2019s chief executive, Richard Scudamore, began exploratory talks with the government. Indeed, one of the people involved in the process estimates that if it went to a vote in the coming week all 20 clubs, bar Liverpool, would support a consultation process.</p> <p>Others suspect Everton might choose to abstain but the safe standing movement certainly appears to be gaining traction. The Chelsea Supporters Trust has asked the club to explore the possibilities at a redeveloped Stamford Bridge. Spurs have already designed parts of their new ground with this in mind, which indicates they imagine the legislation will eventually be changed. David Gold, West Ham\u2019s joint chairman, has backed safe standing and maybe wishes it was already in place, given some of the settling-in issues at their new stadium. Arsenal are keen and, though it is not something the two Manchester clubs feel they should actively push, my information is that both will be supportive, when the time is right. It is just a delicate area when there so many sensitivities to take into account. Nobody wants to be seen as lacking tact, or failing to understand how emotive this issue is on Merseyside.</p> <p>It does, however, feel like more and more people are acknowledging it is time to have the debate and are coming round to the idea that safe standing means exactly what it says, and is arguably safer than the common practice of supporters standing in seated areas.</p> <p>What it does not mean \u2013 and it is important to be clear on this \u2013 is a return to the vast terraces where crushes were once commonplace, injuries taken for granted and a sense of danger was never too far away. A safety barrier would be on each row, eradicating the threat of overcrowding or those old terrace-tumbles when in one sudden sway you could suddenly find yourself transported 20ft in any given direction. The rail seats are bolted upright. They can be turned down for European games, when Uefa insists on all-seated stadiums, but otherwise each spectator would be given a place to stand where their seat would usually be.</p> <p>Liverpool\u2019s position, in line with that of the Hillsborough Family Support Group, is in support of all-seated stadiums and, to go back to my earlier point, this is always going to be a highly sensitive subject. Trevor Hicks, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/jun/16/hillsborough-inquests-trevor-hicks-two-daughters-died-evidence\" title=\"\">whose teenage daughters, Sarah and Victoria</a>, died in the tragedy, has explained to me the group\u2019s thinking and we are talking here about someone whose dignity, courage and perseverance marked him out as a man of rare substance during <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/live/2016/apr/26/hillsborough-disaster-inquest-jury-returns-verdict-live-updates\" title=\"\">that long, almost unimaginable fight</a> to prove Hillsborough was not just a national disaster but a national scandal.</p> <p>His view is that all-seated stadiums have brought more families and young people to football and the sport should not bend to a \u201cvociferous minority who live in the past\u201d. We spoke on Friday and he was absolutely vehement that standing at football should never return. \u201cWe are against any attempts to go backwards. In very simple terms, we think it would be a retrograde step. It is a point of principle and we believe all\u2011seater grounds are much safer.\u201d</p> <p>Is it possible to respect that view, and hold this man in the highest esteem, while also disagreeing? I sincerely hope so because my view is that standing has never really gone away. The Taylor report into the events at Hillsborough, whose recommendations led to the outlawing of standing in the top two divisions, suggested that match\u2011goers would get accustomed to sitting down. Instead, what we see every week are thousands of supporters on their feet in front of their seats. It breaches safety regulations and blocks views. It causes arguments between fans, disputes with stewards and, on occasion, injuries (one recent example being a Manchester United supporter suffering a broken leg when a massed goal celebration at Hull spilled over the seats).</p> <p>In many cases, it also leads to away-fan allocations being reduced, whereas I am yet to see any possible downside to an area such as the one accommodating 2,975 people in a corner of Celtic Park. One quote from the Celtic chief executive, Peter Lawwell, feels highly relevant. \u201cThe introduction of rail seating represents an investment in spectator safety,\u201d he&#xa0;said.</p> <p>A debate of this nature is always going to divide opinion but it does strike me that each club should be allowed the choice and it is a mistake, plain and simple, to assume that everybody affected by Hillsborough is opposed to standing.</p> <p>Stephen Wright, whose brother, Graham, 17, was one of the 96 people to die in that FA Cup semi-final against Nottingham Forest in April 1989, was passed the microphone during the recent AGM of Spirit of Shankly, one of Liverpool\u2019s more influential supporters\u2019 groups, and proceeded to talk in favour of a safe-standing debate, as did every speaker from the floor.</p> <p>Lou Brookes, whose brother, Andrew, died at Hillsborough, aged 26, is another advocate: \u201cI know my brother would have hated sitting. Standing didn\u2019t kill my brother but other factors did.\u201d The Hillsborough Justice Campaign is supportive of a \u201cfull and objective debate\u201d and there was a notable exchange on BBC Radio Merseyside recently when Peter Daykin of the Football Supporters\u2019 Federation was invited to put forward the case for safe standing.</p> <p>Barry Devonside, whose son, Christopher, died at Hillsborough, aged 18, was also on the show, having previously argued in the <em>Liverpool Echo </em>that football should stick with the Taylor report and that it would not be safe to do otherwise. It was all set up for the classic radio format: one guest putting across one side, another taking the opposing view. Except Barry, speaking with dignity and grace, announced he had changed his mind, having made it his business to find out more about what was involved, and now thought there was a legitimate argument that should merit a wider debate.</p> <p>There is certainly an appetite to follow the Bundesliga, given that one of the FSF\u2019s large-scale surveys had 92% of fans in England and Wales wanting a choice between sitting and standing, and you may have seen the news in the last few days about Spirit of Shankly deciding to adopt a position on safe standing, now beginning a process of consultation to determine precisely what that position should be.</p> <p>The surprising thing, perhaps, is that the Premier League has never formally raised the issue when, behind the scenes, the relevant people are fully aware about the strength of support and the sports minister, Tracey Crouch, has stated the standing ban will be reassessed \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/oct/05/liverpool-supporters-consult-hillsborough-safe-standing-anfield\" title=\"\">once evidence from the Scottish experience is available</a>\u201d, the first time any government has committed to a review of the&#xa0;legislation.</p> <p>When the Football League asked its clubs to vote three years ago, 77% were in favour of safe-standing trials. Nobody should be surprised if that number was even higher now bearing in mind the shift in attitude, for instance, that led to Brighton, once opponents of safe standing, announcing a few days ago that they had visited Borussia Dortmund and Celtic, seen how it worked and would eventually like to incorporate such an area at the Amex Stadium. Nobody can be sure when this might be. It is, however, reaching the point when the relevant authorities have to realise it is time they started looking at it seriously&#xa0;themselves.</p>",
  "<p>In 2012, Andrea Arnold was en route to Salt Lake City airport after an intense two days of press interviews at the Sundance film festival in Utah, where her adaptation of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/nov/10/wuthering-heights-film-review\"><em>Wuthering Heights </em></a>had just had its American premiere. It was still dark as she left her hotel at five in the morning, but as the shuttle bus rounded a bend in the road, the sun rose and the elemental landscape around her was suddenly revealed. \u201cI had a bit of an emotional moment,\u201d she says now. \u201cIt just hit me that being in this beautiful place for only two days felt so wrong.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I met kids from mag crews. I stayed in all the same places they would stay, I drove the routes they would drive</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>At the airport, she checked in her bag, but immediately went to the only car hire desk in the concourse. \u201cWhen they said they had one car available, I immediately went and got my bag out of the hold and let go of the flight. It was all very impulsive, but it felt so right. I got in the car and decided to explore America a bit. I needed to connect emotionally with it somehow and a road trip seemed the best way to do that.\u201d</p> <p>That spur-of-the-moment expedition was the first of several extended American road trips over the following few years \u201cthrough the south, up the middle, everywhere I could go\u201d. It was the beginning, too, of a creative journey that has led to her latest film, <em>American Honey</em>, a road movie that unfolds over almost three hours.</p> <p>It is the first film Arnold has made in America: gone are the sink housing estates, tower blocks and claustrophobic interiors of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2006/oct/29/philipfrench\"><em>Red Road</em></a> (2006) and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2009/sep/13/fish-tank-andrea-arnold-french\"><em>Fish Tank </em></a>(2009), her brutally realist depictions of working-class life in contemporary Britain; they are replaced by the vast plains, endless highways and mega-malls of an America that is both recognisably real \u2013 in its poverty and exclusion \u2013 and knowingly cinematic.</p> <p>\u201cAmerica is a vast and complicated place filled with all kinds of truths and contradictions and I wanted to find my own emotional connection to it,\u201d she says. \u201cOtherwise I couldn\u2019t have made this film. It\u2019s a mixture of what I saw and learned on those travels, but also what I grew up seeing on films \u2013 the mythical America of westerns and road movies.

Eighteen-year-old Star (played brilliantly by newcomer Sasha Lane) joins them on impulse, desperate to escape her harsh home life and drawn to the street-smart charisma of recruiter Jake (Shia LaBeouf, the Hollywood actor and sometime performance artist whose film roles to date range from the Michael Bay blockbuster series <em>Transformers</em> to Lars von Trier\u2019s <em>Nymphomaniac</em>). They have a short, intense and, for her, damaging relationship \u2013 he is also entangled with Krystal (played by Elvis\u2019s granddaughter, Riley Keough), the beautiful and bullying crew manager, whose rules of the road tend towards the sadistic and humiliating. In subject and style, critics have compared the film to those of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/harmony-korine\">Harmony Korine</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/gus-van-sant\">Gus Van Sant</a> and even <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/terrence-malick\">Terrence Malick</a>.</p> <p>I myself was struck by how closely the mag crew resembled the real-life itinerants, runaways and train-hoppers photographed by Mike Brodie in his 2013 book <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2013/mar/30/mike-brodie-juvenile-train-rider-photos-interview\"><em>A Period of Juvenile Prosperity</em></a>. \u201cYes!\u201d exclaims Arnold, when I mention this. \u201cI love his photos, they\u2019re beautiful.

He didn\u2019t seem in a different world to the rest of us.\u201d (Since I spoke to her, the tabloids have revealed that she and LaBeouf are a couple, with the <em>Daily Mail</em> describing how he \u201cromanced the newcomer both on and off camera in the whirlwind 56-day shoot\u201d.)</p> <p>The crews of magazine subscription sellers on whom the film is based are an actual phenomenon that has somehow survived into the digital age. \u201cI met kids from mag crews,\u201d says Arnold, who spent months recruiting unknowns for the film. \u201cI stayed in all the same places they would stay, I drove the routes they would drive.\u201d</p> <p>Her interest was piqued when she read an investigative article about them by Ian Urbina in the <em>New York Times</em> in 2007. In it, he described young kids living on $10 a day and sleeping three to a motel room amid constant threats of violence. A common ritual, which features only fleetingly in Arnold\u2019s film, involves the lowest subscription sellers on each crew being forced to fight each other in front of the others. Urbina also wrote of widespread hard drug use, beatings dealt out by crew managers, thefts from customers and \u201cseveral highly publicised fatal accidents and violent crimes involving the sales crews.\u201d</p> <p>The kids in Arnold\u2019s fictional mag crew are a much more romanticised bunch, stoners rather than meth-heads, messed up but not to the point of violence or addiction. She and her scouting assistant found them in shopping malls, skate parks and urban beaches across America. One of their number, Raymond Coalson, 22, from West Virginia, told the <em>New York Times</em>: \u201cWhen they talked to me, I was like, \u2018Are you sure it\u2019s not a porno? Because I\u2019m not down with that.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Just weeks before the film started shooting, 19-year-old Texan Sasha Lane was on spring break on a beach in Florida, when she was approached to be in the movie. \u201cReally, I didn\u2019t know anything about acting, so I was surprised and a bit wary,\u201d says Lane now. Her expressive face and instinctive emotional range is \u2013 along with Arnold\u2019s regular collaborator Robbie Ryan\u2019s luminous cinematography \u2013 the most powerful element in the film. \u201cWhen we started improvising, I began slowly to feel comfortable. It seems almost overwhelming now but, back then at that moment, I felt I could do anything because she gave me this sense of confidence in myself.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"399bb9ee3cb3f45b407d5d7a0e0f953977c3c1ff\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/399bb9ee3cb3f45b407d5d7a0e0f953977c3c1ff/0_0_5103_3309/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sasha Lane as Star in American Honey\" width=\"1000\" height=\"648\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Magnetic presence\u2019: Sasha Lane as Star in American Honey.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rex Features</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>For the eight-week shoot, LaBeouf committed to living on the road with the production team and the cast of mainly unknowns, sleeping in cheap motels across Oklahoma and North Dakota like the actual mag crews, shooting throughout the day and partying into the night. The film\u2019s freewheeling style makes you wonder if Arnold ever turned off the camera; the atmosphere is one of on-the-road languor mixed with edgy camaraderie.</p> <p>\u201cIt was a real road trip movie in that sense,\u201d says Arnold who, at 55, has something of the eternal teenager about her. \u201cWe were all together from the beginning, with no one flying in and out. Crazily, we went up to the Dakotas, where I had never been on my road trips, and started in Muskogee [Oklahoma], one of the poorest towns in America. It seemed as good a place as any to start from.\u201d</p> <p>Arnold has used unknowns before, but what was it like to work with so many untrained actors; was the camaraderie we see on screen echoed in real life?</p> <p>\u201cSometimes. Yes and no. There was a lot of bonding but there were also times when somebody would behave quite badly and there was a lot of anger about. It was tough, I have to say. We had our moments.\u201d</p> <p>Could she elaborate?</p> <p>\u201cNo. No way.\u201d She sounds slightly affronted. \u201cI can\u2019t repeat some of the things that happened on the set. I just can\u2019t. It would be a betrayal somehow but suffice to say we had some dramas.\u201d</p> <p>Did she have to fire anyone along the way?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4949ac8af92a20cfb7ebd424d4561cb7519e1ad5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4949ac8af92a20cfb7ebd424d4561cb7519e1ad5/0_0_1280_720/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Natalie Press in Wasp, Arnold\u2019s award-winning 2009 short film\" width=\"1000\" height=\"563\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Natalie Press in Wasp, Arnold\u2019s award-winning 2003 short film.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: handout/Handout</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cNo, it didn\u2019t come to that,\u201d she laughs, \u201cbut it was hard, physically and emotionally.

Born in Erith, Kent, she was the eldest of four children \u2013 her mother was just 16 and her father 17 when she was born. \u201cI grew up in a working-class family,\u201d she once said, \u201cso you could say I write from what I know.\u201d She seems to have been a darkly serious child, writing one of her first stories, aged 10, about the slave trade, and creating a performance piece for her dance GCSE in which she recited <em>The Diary of Anne Frank</em>. Having left school at 16, she landed a job as a dancer on <em>Top of the Pops</em>, before going on to present a children\u2019s TV show, <em>No 73</em>, alongside Sandi Toksvig, the beginning of a 10-year career in television that also included a stint presenting the children\u2019s Saturday morning show <em>Motormouth</em>. Throughout, she continued writing and her early shorts, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KJCizVeowE\"><em>Milk</em></a> (1998), <em>Dog </em>(2001) and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6lrf7lUDkY\"><em>Wasp</em></a> (2003), which starred Natalie Press and Danny Dyer, were made after she studied directing at the American Film Institute of Los Angeles.</p> <p>In 2006 her first feature film, <em>Red Road</em>, a claustrophobic study in obsession and revenge, introduced her abiding subject \u2013 young people searching for hope in difficult circumstances \u2013 and her willingness to take risks by casting unknowns. Shot using hand-held cameras and available light for around \u00a31m, and set in and around the Red Road flats in Barmulloch, Glasgow, it won the Jury prize at Cannes. The acclaimed<em> Fish Tank</em> followed in 2009, again featuring a fierce young girl (played with visceral intensity by newcomer Kate Jarvis) railing against her circumstances. On watching it again, I was struck by the sustained sexual tension between Conor (Michael Fassbender) and the underage Mia (Jarvis), and how casually harsh her everyday life is, from her scathing verbal exchanges with her family and neighbours to her acute sense of aloneness.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I have a lot of respect for Shia and we got on really well\u2026 a few more free spirits would make life more interesting</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>To Arnold\u2019s annoyance, critics have often described her films as bleak, as if she has somehow exaggerated the struggles of her characters. \u201cThe last lady who interviewed me mentioned the bleak word,\u201d she says, grimacing. \u201cI get that a lot but I let it wash over me now. I don\u2019t think my films are bleak at all.\u201d</p> <p>She does seem drawn to the marginalised and excluded\u2026</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s true,\u201d she says. \u201cI can\u2019t argue with that.\u201d</p> <p>How does she feel about being linked to the older generation of socially conscious film-makers? She shrugs.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m OK with that, but I don\u2019t try and emulate anyone. A film for me is a journey I have to go on. It starts with myself emotionally and moves outwards. I do make my films with a social eye. It\u2019s not a huge thing, and I don\u2019t want to ram it down people\u2019s throats, but it\u2019s there all the time in the way I feel and think. It\u2019s just how I see the world.\u201d</p> <p>Her films also share a strong sense of place, whether it\u2019s the darkly lit Glasgow of <em>Red Road </em>or the widescreen midwestern landscape of <em>American Honey</em>. She certainly picked an interesting time to make a film there.</p> <p>\u201cOh yes,\u201d she says, shaking her head. \u201cI think the temperature has gone up since we were there, but you could feel something in the air then. It\u2019s a place of very stark divides, but it was exciting to try to get under the belly of the place, which is what I always aim to do.\u201d</p> <p>Arnold can be a frustrating interviewee, affable but defensive, even a bit prickly if the subject moves off the work. Her eyes darken beneath her cropped fringe when she grows uncomfortable and you sense that you wouldn\u2019t want to get on the wrong side of her. She will provide a tantalising snippet of information, then steadfastly refuses to discuss it in any detail.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"802952873d51d4bdc1338506595b888df23b366a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/802952873d51d4bdc1338506595b888df23b366a/0_115_1387_883/1000.jpg\" alt=\"American Honey still\" width=\"1000\" height=\"637\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Arnold on working with a large group of non-professional actors: \u2018We got on so well, but sometimes I\u2019d have to shout.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Handout</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Of working with the conundrum that is Shia LaBeouf, who sometimes threatens to destabilise the precarious chemistry of the <em>American Honey </em>ensemble with his characteristically unrestrained approach, she says: \u201cI have a lot of respect for him and we got on really well. A lot of the stuff that people were telling me beforehand made me quite angry because they were not taking him as a human being, and I had met him. Someone sent me an online spoof that made me angry as well. It\u2019s so easy now to be cruel. I don\u2019t go by things I read in the media or online or whatever \u2013 that\u2019s a small part of someone.\u201d</p> <p>He does, though, have a reputation for unpredictable behaviour.</p> <p>\u201cA lot of that comes from a few incidents. He has grown up as a celebrity with all that entails today and he has been challenging his place in all that, which I respect. There are very few mavericks in Hollywood. A few more free spirits would make life more interesting.\u201d</p> <p>Why, though, did she choose him rather than another unknown? \u201cWe just got on really well, Someone suggested him for the role so I met him in a cafe in London and I talked to him about the film and he went for it. He\u2019s a very experimental actor. He never questioned the way I wanted to work. He loved it.\u201d</p> <p>It is Sasha Lane\u2019s Star, though, who is the most magnetic presence in the film, from the moment we see her scavenging in a supermarket bin for discarded food to the final symbolic scene in which she appears to gain a degree of hard-earned self-awareness. Her face is an index of her internal state, which fluctuates from Zen acceptance to reckless impulsiveness. Was she aware of the existence of the real mag crews beforehand?</p> <p>\u201cI knew about them all right. I\u2019ve had people come up to my door.

I was raised outside of Dallas. It\u2019s a tough life, for sure, minimum wage, multiple jobs, real hard work. There\u2019s a huge struggle to it, not having a lot of money and not having a lot of support, but it\u2019s what I grew up with.\u201d</p> <p>Did she identify with her character?</p> <p>\u201cI did. For a lot of those kids, life is just something they take day by day to get by. It\u2019s about having nothing left to lose and accepting it. It\u2019s what I took from my own experience and brought to the movie. I have a lot of love for people in their raw human form. Their lives are kind of beautiful and hard. They don\u2019t let fear get in the way.\u201d</p> <p>At times, though, Star\u2019s storyline seems almost incidental to the film, so central is the road-trip element. It unfolds with wilful repetition through several long scenes in which the kids chat, drink, sleep and verbally spar on the bus to the constant backdrop of thumping hip-hop, R&amp;B and, somewhat incongruously, Lady Antebellum\u2019s lush country song from 2010 that gives the film its title.</p> <p>When <em>American Honey </em>premiered at Cannes in May, Arnold won the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2016/jun/21/american-honey-first-trailer-for-andrea-arnolds-cannes-winner-teases-rebel-spirit\">Jury prize for the third time</a>, but the film has divided opinion. The <em>New York Times</em> described it as, \u201cby turns observant and exuberant, and sweet in a way that is both unexpected and organic\u201d, while one British reviewer dismissed it, unfairly, as \u201cin effect a music video of tediously exaggerated proportions\u201d.</p> <p>There were times as I watched it when I did feel as if I was trapped on the bus with a bunch of hyperactive teenagers \u2013 seemingly immune to the soporific effect of the weed they smoked or the vast distances they travelled.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/oct/05/andrea-arnold-shocked-at-lack-of-women-directors-american-honey\">Andrea Arnold shocked at lack of women directors</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Arnold seems unfazed by criticisms of the film\u2019s longueurs and repetitiveness. \u201cI didn\u2019t set out to make a long film, but that\u2019s what happened. There were all these beautiful people in the film and I wanted them not to be just wallpaper so I allowed them to do things that were not part of the script. Sometimes, when we were travelling there might not be a scene written but we would film them anyway.\u201d</p> <p>It turns out that there had been even more on-the-road scenes in an earlier cut, but Arnold was persuaded to excise them as the film nudged the three-hour timespan. \u201cThe travelling really reflects the lives of the actual mag crews and the time they spend on those buses. It was integral to me. But, when we first showed those early cuts, the audiences were feeling it,\u201d she laughs. \u201cThey were experiencing what it was like to be on that bus \u2013 which I thought was perhaps not a bad thing!\u201d</p> <p>That quip says a lot about Arnold, a film-maker for whom the usual industry rules of writing, casting and shooting do not seem to apply. And, despite its length and meandering plot, <em>American Honey </em>is a film that sticks in the mind long afterwards. Its portrait of American outsiders surviving against the odds in an often wondrous landscape recalls the great gritty American road movies of the early 70s. Arnold is a maverick with a social conscience at a time when we certainly need independent voices, both here and in Hollywood. \u201cI don\u2019t make easy choices,\u201d she says, \u201cbut there is always more to it for me than just making a film.\u201d</p> <p><em>American Honey is out on 14 October</em></p>",
  "<p>The lost weekend of Lewis Hamilton, like that of Ray Milland in the film noir classic, is likely to result in an epic hangover.

I think just after such a race, it is not the right moment to really put the finger where it hurts.</p> <p>\u201cWe need to calm down and find out what happened, regroup and my learning from the last couple of years is that 24 hours later things look different. Our main emphasis will be on building him up and enjoying the ride home before Austin.\u201d</p> <p>Besides, Wolff was hardly in a postmortem mood after seeing his team nail their third constructors\u2019 title in three years, while Rosberg closed on his first drivers\u2019 championship.</p> <p>Hamilton has caused Mercedes much embarrassment recently, however. After the Malaysian Grand Prix, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/oct/02/daniel-ricciardo-wins-malaysian-grand-prix-lewis-hamilton-f1\">where his engine blew 15 laps from the end</a> of a race he was dominating, he gave ammunition to the many conspiracy theorists on social media when he said that someone did not want him to win the tile. Then in Suzuka press conferences on Thursday and Saturday \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/oct/06/lewis-hamilton-f1-under-fire-snapchat-bunny-app\">the Snapchat farce</a> followed by an overreaction by the driver <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/oct/08/lewis-hamilton-walks-out-japan-gp-press-conference\">when he refused to answer any questions</a> \u2013 there were signs of a mental fragility not seen since his meltdown year of 2011. And again on Sunday evening there was more controversy when he appeared to go against an appeal decision made by his team.</p> <p>Hamilton remains Mercedes\u2019s \u2013 indeed Formula One\u2019s \u2013 major asset and his team will be anxious that all is well with him going into the final four races of the season, starting with the US round in Austin on 23 October. So they are likely to speak to him.</p> <p>Wolff said: \u201cI saw a Lewis in Malaysia that was on a roll, dominating, then we let him down with the engine failure. During the week he was OK \u2013 then all these things around the press conference, then yesterday.\u201d</p> <p>Hamilton, of course, has had rotten luck, plain and simple, with three engine failures, in China, Russia and Malaysia. There are also signs, though, that Rosberg\u2019s greater strength and consistency this season is beginning to get to him. After all, Hamilton has been beating Rosberg on a regular basis for almost two decades and the prospect of losing the 2016 world championship to him will be hurting him grievously.</p> <p>Then there is the technical issue of his bad starts. For the fifth time this season Hamilton made a wretched getaway, immediately dropping from his second place on the grid to eighth. That followed other awful starts in Australia, Bahrain, Canada and Italy. Rosberg, it seems, has no trouble with the extra demands on clutch control that are being made this season.</p> <p>\u201cThe clutch is not perfect,\u201d says Wolff. \u201cIt\u2019s difficult to handle and we have tried to optimise it. I have never driven the clutch, so I can only tell you what we analyse. It is difficult to handle it in the right way and both drivers have worked on it and gone as far as changing the way their gloves are in order to release it.</p> <p>\u201cIt is very complicated to deploy and then there is the random factor. We are also more in the spotlight if it goes wrong [because Mercedes are usually running at the front].\u201d</p> <p>Hamilton still had a decent couple of days in Japan, even though Rosberg dominated all three practice sessions as well as qualifying and the race itself. The British driver was as close as 0.013sec to Rosberg in qualifying and on Sunday he clawed his way up to the field in a valiant effort to make up for yet another disappointing beginning and almost came second. That will not be helping the hurt he is feeling, knowing that the championship is now beyond his control.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2016/oct/09/f1-japanese-grand-prix-live\">F1: Japanese Grand Prix - as it happened</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Rosberg, meanwhile, just cannot stop winning. This was his ninth victory of the season (while Hamilton has six). There was a growing sense in Japan that Rosberg deserves the world title this year. Certainly he will if he wins more races and goes on to take the championship by a healthy margin of more than 25 points, which seems likely now.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s been an awesome weekend, for sure, the whole weekend had gone great from the word go,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s been very, very special, especially on this legendary track. It\u2019s beautiful to win here.\u201d</p> <p>If Hamilton was imploding in Japan, Rosberg hadn\u2019t noticed. \u201cI haven\u2019t seen any \u2018self-destruction\u2019,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Lewis that I have seen was massively motivated and focused.

  "<p>There is something bracing, even exciting, about the intellectual rigour that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/sep/30/ava-duvernay-selma-13th-interview-criminal-justice-system\" title=\"\">Ava DuVernay</a> brings to this documentary about the prison system and the economic forces behind racism in America. The film takes its title from the 13th amendment, which outlawed slavery but left a significant loophole. This clause, which allowed that involuntary servitude could be used as a punishment for crime, was exploited immediately in the aftermath of the civil war and, DuVernay argues, continues to be abused to this day.</p> <p>There is an understandable anger to this film-making, but DuVernay, who is best known as the director of <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/feb/08/selma-observer-film-review\" title=\"\">Selma</a></em>, but cut her teeth as a documentarian, never allows it to cloud the clarity of her message. It\u2019s an approach that reminded me of the fierce intelligence of Charles Ferguson\u2019s <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2007/aug/10/noendinsightisamuchneededdocumentaryoniraq\" title=\"\">No End in Sight</a></em> and <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/feb/20/inside-job-charles-ferguson-review\" title=\"\">Inside Job</a></em>. Leaning on eloquent talking-head interviews and well-sourced archive material, she draws a defined through-line from the abolition of slavery, through the chain gang labour that replaced it, through segregation and \u201cthe mythology of black criminality\u201d, to the war on crime and the war on drugs to the rise in mass incarceration and the big business of prisons. The words are so piercing and acute that we hardly need the stirring score that swirls in the background. The ever-present music is the one poorly judged element of the film. It clutters up a picture that is already densely packed with ideas and information.</p> <p>More effective is the use of text: salient facts and figures are branded across the frame, searing them into our memory. And there is some memorable information imparted. That the US has less than 5% of the world\u2019s population and almost 25% of the world\u2019s prisoners is something that shouldn\u2019t be forgotten.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qksFq4Ovjug\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/qksFq4Ovjug?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qksFq4Ovjug\">Watch the trailer for 13th.</a></figcaption> </figure>",
  "<p>The death of a child nominally links the two plots. Yet Puccini\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.operanorth.co.uk/productions/il-tabarro-suor-angelica\"><em>Il tabarro </em>and <em>Suor Angelica</em></a> are so different they shatter any fragile notion of similarity. One is set outside in Paris on the banks of the Seine, a dark, seedy, hard-drinking male landscape of relentless labour and squally sexuality. The other is clean, enclosed, ordered, all-female; a convent in which freedoms are repressed, desires scrubbed and pumiced out of sight. God alone is love. Anything else is sin. As a double bill, strongly cast and presented as part of Opera North\u2019s autumn season and conducted by <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBfx6sKnc0M\">Jac van Steen</a>, they devastate.</p> <p>These short operas equal two thirds of <em>Il trittico</em>. Puccini\u2019s trio, premiered in New York in 1918, makes a long evening and is complicated and costly to stage; therefore it\u2019s quite a rarity in the theatre. Each work can be paired with something else \u2013 not restricted to Puccini \u2013 which is how they are more usually seen. Now, with a new <em>Suor Angelica</em> directed by Michael Barker-Caven, Opera North has all three operas in its repertoire. One day a complete <em>Il trittico </em>maybe, but this was a richly satisfying evening even minus the brilliant, comedic third element, <em>Gianni Schicchi</em>.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Donna Elvira is all the more potent for the control Christine Rice exerts in one astonishing aria after another</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p><strong>Il tabarro</strong> (The cloak) arguably contains some of the composer\u2019s most poised and finely wrought music. (There are plenty of moments in Puccini that make you think this. <em>Tabarro</em> tends to get swamped by more obvious contenders.) At the opening, the orchestra\u2019s watery undulations conjure the night heat of the river bank. Borrowing from Debussy\u2019s example, Puccini stamps his score with pentatonic chords (open fourths and fifths moving in parallel motion), a desolate sound pierced with harsh, tugging, repetitive chords. The musical tools are subtle, the result an outpouring of anguish. Puccini is intent, here, not on expansive melody but atmosphere, mood. In Leeds, conductor and orchestra tackled this music with sparing intensity.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"570ae124e163b1c7cbdafef9547b8087df8fb061\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/570ae124e163b1c7cbdafef9547b8087df8fb061/0_308_4978_2985/1000.jpg\" alt=\"You could quite see why this Giorgetta went for Luigi\u2019: David Butt Philip and Giselle Allen in Il tabarro.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018You could quite see why this Giorgetta went for Luigi\u2019: David Butt Philip and Giselle Allen in Il tabarro.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tristram Kenton</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Barker-Caven, artistic director of the <a href=\"https://www.civictheatre.ie/\">Civic theatre, Dublin</a>, has revived David Pountney\u2019s enthralling 2004 staging, which made a punchy return in its industrial shipping container setting.

  "<p>Australian superstar Caitlin Bassett put on a shooting masterclass in Sydney this afternoon to lead her netball Diamonds to victory over the Silver Ferns in the first Test of the Constellation Cup series.</p> <p>Bassett knocked down 47 goals from 47 attempts in three quarters as Australia ran out 68-56 winners. The Maria Tutaia-less Ferns were plain outclassed and couldn\u2019t match the Diamonds\u2019 physicality and precision. </p> <p>On the court that hosted last year\u2019s Netball World Cup triumph over their trans-Tasman rival, the Diamonds made up for a \u201cscratchy\u201d performance against the Kiwis in last month\u2019s Quad Series and showed they\u2019ll be hard, if not impossible, to beat in the four-match 12-day series, which moves to Launceston on Wednesday, before matches in Auckland and Invercargill. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/sep/27/forget-the-negativity-australias-new-netball-league-could-pass-the-pub-test\">Forget the negativity, Australia's new netball league could pass the pub test | Erin Delahunty</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The Diamonds were fierce, physical and accountable from end-to-end. The 12-goal win at Olympic Park\u2019s Qudos Bank Arena, in front of 15,161 fans, saw the Australians shut down the expansive, attacking game that helped the Ferns sensationally beat the Diamonds in the preliminary rounds of the World Cup \u2013 a performance they couldn\u2019t replicate in the gold medal match.</p> <p>Diamonds coach Lisa Alexander went with a new-look attack end, pairing 193cm West Australian Bassett with code-hopper Gretel Tippett \u2013 in just her seventh Test. </p> <p>Bassett was the most experienced Aussie on-court, with 62 caps. The Australian midcourt was the one Collingwood will boast in the new national league next year; with Kim Ravaillion at centre and Madi Robinson at wing attack, who had a great tussle with Kiwi legend Laura Langman, who started at wing defence, but swung into centre at half-time, before returning to Robinson in the last.</p> <p>Robinson, still yet to hit her best form since a knee reconstruction, played her way into the match after a quiet start by her standards. From the first whistle, as is her way, Swift-turned-Pie Sharni Layton didn\u2019t take a backward step against Kiwi shooter Bailey Mes.</p> <p>The ferocious defender clearly relished knowing the Diamonds\u2019 goal keeper bib is pretty much hers with Laura Geitz out of the game for at least a year; expecting her first child in March.</p> <p>Layton dominated the first, with two clean intercepts and four deflections; the crowd roaring louder each time she went anywhere near the ball. She paired with her captain Clare McMeniman in defence, supported by Queensland Firebird Gabi Simpson \u2013 one of the few Diamonds who didn\u2019t move domestic clubs in the frenetic trade period recently \u2013 at wing defence.</p> <p>Simpson, one of the youngest Diamonds at 23, had her hands full with Fern Grace Rasmussen attacking the contest in her usual unrelenting style. At the other end, Bassett was having the time of her life, shooting 14 from 14 for a clean sheet in the first. </p> <p>Tippett, looking at times like her AFL superstar brother Kurt, flying for a mark at the SCG, showed off her aerial athleticism and shot two from two for the quarter. She also made sure her direct opponent, Kiwi captain Katrina Grant, didn\u2019t have the time or inclination to go hunting the ball. </p> <p>With the Aussies on top across the court, the first finished 16-11. The Ferns came out firing in the second, scoring the first three to bring it back to 16-14, until the Diamonds responded with three of their own, all care of Bassett, to make it 19-14.</p> <p>Kiwi keeper Jane Watson came into the game in the second, coming out of the circle and making the most of a few rare ball-handling errors from the Diamonds\u2019 midcourt. The Aussies\u2019 accuracy under the post continued in the second, with Bassett shooting 15/15 \u2013 to stay at 100% \u2013 and Tippett just one for the quarter. </p> <p>It was 32-22 Australia\u2019s way at half-time. Alexander tweaked her line-up at the main break, putting April Brandley into goal defence for just her seventh international and bringing stalwart Nat Medhurst into goal attack, replacing Tippett. </p> <p>The Queenslander finished with just three goals from four attempts, but a staggering 14 feeds, just two behind her best mate Ravaillion, who had 16 for the half. She also had seven goal assists. </p> <p>Silver Ferns coach Janine Southby changed her line-up too, putting Te Paea Selby-Rickit into goal attack, replacing Ameliaranne Ekenasio, who finished with 12 from 14. She also swung Langman into centre and brought Anna Harrison into wing defence.</p> <p>Selby-Rickit had an immediate impact, opening up the Kiwis attacking end, but with Bassett shooting 18/18 in the third, maintaining a blemish-free game, and Medhurst chipping in with four from six, there was little the Ferns could do to stop the bleeding. </p> <p>It was 54-38 at three-quarter time. Caitlin Thwaites started the last at goal shooter for the Diamonds and Vixen Liz Watson took over from Ravaillion in the centre. Phoenix Karaka came on to mind Thwaites and Langman went back to wing defence to try and counter Robinson\u2019s growing influence.</p> <p>The Ferns managed to outscore the Diamonds in the last, 18-14, but with Thwaites missing just one for the quarter, to finish with 13 from 14, the Ferns were just going through the motions. </p> <p>The series moves to Launceston for the second Test, on Wednesday night.</p>",
  "<p>Henri and Catherine are old friends of mine and, in between flats, they are staying with me for a month. They are also French. On Tuesday, after home secretary <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/oct/04/conservative-conference-theresa-mays-morning-broadcast-interviews-politics-live\" title=\"\">Amber Rudd\u2019s speech</a> at the Conservative party conference, Henri was visibly shaken. \u201cWhen we came here we felt welcome,\u201d he said. \u201cPart of an open society. Now we don\u2019t. Not only are we now foreign \u2013 we are made to <em>feel</em> foreign. Not wanted. Unwelcome. Alien.\u201d</p> <p>Rudd is not racist, but words matter \u2013 and she finds herself the home secretary in a Ukip-lite party whose overwhelming drive is to keep its promise to reduce immigration to the tens of thousands. She \u2013 and the prime minister \u2013 wanted the headlines last week about British jobs for British workers, signalling a willingness to clamp down on the foreign other in our midst.</p> <p>Rudd was quick to qualify the part of her speech \u2013 that companies should be forced to disclose how many foreign workers they employ \u2013 as only an option as the hostile reaction mounted, especially from business. But her speech won the headlines. It also came with a string of measures that will turn us into a nation of mini-commissars, compelled to snoop on those who look and sound different.</p> <p>Landlords who knowingly rent out property to people \u201cwho have no right to be in Britain\u201d will be now committing a criminal offence, declared Rudd. Immigrant checks will be a mandatory requirement for those wanting to get a licence to drive a taxi. Banks will have regularly to check that they are not providing banking services to illegal migrants. EU nationals who commit minor crimes are to be deported immediately. Family members of foreign students will not be allowed to work. There will be new restrictions on entry for foreign students.</p> <p>It was a broadside of initiatives that cumulatively created the impact that so disturbed Henri. Britain is to change from being a society tolerant of immigrants and accommodating \u2013 sometimes celebrating \u2013 the resulting diversity, even while it tries to manage the numbers, to a society vigilant and hostile to any sign of otherness.</p> <p>Everyone knows why. Ukip won four million votes. The EU referendum was lost. The new conventional wisdom, driven home with demagogic genius by Nigel Farage, is that an out-of-touch elite has indulged a transformational increase in immigration that has put untold pressure on public services, depressed wages, and denied jobs to the indigenous. It should not be racist to talk about this. Left-behind, fed-up Britain has sent an unmistakable message. It must be heard.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/oct/06/uk-theatres-call-for-urgent-help-for-child-refugees-in-calais\">UK theatres call for urgent help for child refugees in Calais</a> </p> </aside>  <p>So it must \u2013 but quite like this? Ukip 10 years ago sought an apology from David Cameron, who described it as a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2006/apr/04/conservatives.uk\" title=\"\">\u201cbunch of fruitcakes, loonies and closet racists\u201d</a>; campaigning for an EU referendum offered a veneer of respectability that disguised the mix of nativism and semi-racism that bound it together.</p> <p>But Cameron was right. Now the referendum cause is removed, Ukip is disintegrating. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/06/ukip-leadership-favourite-steven-woolfe-collapses-in-european-parliament\" title=\"\">Friday morning\u2019s picture of Ukip\u2019s Stephen Woolfe</a> on the floor in the European parliament after an altercation with a fellow Ukip MEP told its own eloquent story.</p> <p>The Tory party \u2013 and the wider political establishment \u2013 can and should be braver. May is right to champion worker rights, industrial policy and stakeholder capitalism. She can extend that to a more nuanced approach to immigration. What was unnerving about the conference was watching the near-delight with which a party \u2013 once the reliable friend of an open, tolerant , outward-looking Britain \u2013 embraced Ukip\u2019s creed even as Ukip shows ultimately that it leads nowhere. Whether fervently applauding Rudd, or at fringe events eagerly deploring all things European, this felt like a party deserting what it had once been. Once, it could castigate Enoch Powell for his rivers of blood speech. That would not happen now.</p> <p>One excuse is that Ruddism represents the new patriotism behind which a liberal elite refuses to rally, but that is gravely to traduce the multiplicity of strands that lie behind pride in Britain. The patriotism of many of us \u2013 at least the 16 million who voted to remain, and I believe many who voted to leave \u2013 is a pride in being the country of Shakespeare, Wilberforce and Darwin, a country that embraced religious tolerance and democracy before others, was open to great European scholars like Erasmus and has welcomed Huguenots and Jewish refugees alike. We do not want to unleash the darker side of a small minority, permitting bigotry and insults at anyone betraying a hint of foreignness. It\u2019s not what Britain, or any society, should ever be.</p> <p>If there are hard-pressed public services in areas of high immigration, invest more. Explain that immigration and openness enrich us. Train our people so that they are equipped to work wherever. Invest in social housing. Explain that the impact on wages, apart from a few towns and a few trades, is minimal. Celebrate the myriad ways that immigrants benefit us, from path-breaking research in our universities to toiling in night shifts in the NHS.</p> <p>Certainly let\u2019s have emergency triggers to create pauses in excessive immigrant inflows, and make benefits contingent on having made contributions. But stamp on racism and offer no means through which it can be expressed.</p> <p>Let\u2019s stand up for a vision of an open, tolerant, outward-looking country that is proud of all it has given the world. We are not a nation of wannabe Ukippers.</p> <p>Henri, stick with us. There is a better Britain. A vast majority welcomes you being here.</p>",
  "<p>Midway through her conference speech, Amber Rudd paused and waited for the applause. At first, her announcement that only the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/oct/04/rudd-announces-crackdown-on-overseas-students-and-new-work-visas\" title=\"\">\u201cbrightest and best\u201d foreign students </a>would be welcome in British universities, and that those wanting to join \u201clower quality courses\u201d should be kept out because they would be economically unproductive, drew none. She smiled expectantly, and then came a ripple. Was her Tory audience a little confused? Was this really the same Amber Rudd who only weeks before had warned that Brexit would do untold damage to the nation and cause an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2016/mar/24/energy-secretary-electric-shock-eu-referendum-brexit\" title=\"\">\u201celectric shock\u201d to the UK economy?</a> The same Amber Rudd who had said before the EU referendum that Boris Johnson was not fit to run you home after a party, never mind run anything else? The same person who had appeared on TV over the summer fulminating against those misguided, narrow-minded Brexiters?</p> <p>Last week\u2019s Tory conference required everyone to clear their memory banks and delete all such inconvenient details of recent history. Never mind what Rudd had believed so passionately in June. Here was the new-look home secretary embracing a hard Brexit as a fantastic opportunity to slash immigration, keep young foreigners out if they were judged second-rate, and shame British companies who signed up too many overseas workers and not enough Brits. \u201cWork with us, not against us, and we\u2019ll better control immigration and protect our economy,\u201d was her message now. When Theresa May spoke the following day, Rudd and Johnson, the prime minister\u2019s surprise choice for the post of foreign secretary, were new best friends, sitting side by side, glancing approvingly at one another time after time as ovation followed ovation.</p> <p>In party political terms, the Conservatives will look back on their four days in Birmingham as a success. Unity was what mattered most, not consistency. In the insulated confines of Birmingham\u2019s International Convention Centre, it seemed to matter little that the pound was diving on world markets or that representatives of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/sep/30/nissan-hard-brexit-compensation-new-uk-investment-tariffs\" title=\"\">UK car industry</a> were touring the bars warning that Nissan and other big companies might well decide to move their plants to Slovakia within months because a hard Brexit would be a disaster, and a soft one little better. \u201cWe can see no outcome for us from all of this that is better than what we have now,\u201d said one senior car industry figure.</p> <p>Most Brexit-supporting Tory MPs seemed not the least bit alarmed by such talk. They convinced each other that it was all going very well indeed. \u201cWe are resetting the dial on British politics,\u201d one remarked. \u201cMarkets fluctuate. The pound will recover. Look what the falling pound is doing for our exports!\u201d While most Conservatives wore looks of cheery optimism that bordered in some cases on smugness, Labour, the supposedly pro-EU party to which the forgotten 48% who voted to remain are looking to for reassurance and hope, was notably quiet.</p> <p>After his own difficult party conference the week before, Jeremy Corbyn was pictured walking in Northumberland with his wife as the Tories got under way in Birmingham. Later in the week he was more concerned with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/07/labour-reshuffle-jonathan-ashworth-shadow-health-secretary-nec-national-executive-committee\" title=\"\">reshuffling his shadow cabinet </a>than commenting on the country\u2019s future in Europe.</p> <p>The frustration of those who want to fight against hard Brexit and who are tearing their hair out at Labour\u2019s divisions on issues as central to the Brexit debate as immigration was perhaps best exemplified by news that an exasperated <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/07/tony-blair-political-comeback-labour\" title=\"\">Tony Blair was considering returning</a> to some role in front-line politics. \u201cFrankly, it\u2019s a tragedy for British politics if the choice before the country is a Conservative government going for a hard Brexit and an ultra-left Labour party that believes in a set of policies that takes us back to the 60s,\u201d Blair told <em>Esquire</em> magazine. \u201cDo I feel strongly about it? Yes, I do. Am I very motivated by that? Yes. Where do I go from here? What exactly do I do? That\u2019s an open question.\u201d</p> <p>He and others could see that the Tories were wide open to challenge but were being allowed, by the lack of effective opposition, to run what he called a \u201cone-party state\u201d and drive the UK out of the EU in a way that much of the business community regards as hugely risky and without regard to the concerns of the almost half of voters who backed Remain on 23 June.</p> <p>The Conservatives had two objectives last week and the more they tried to deliver on both, the more the tensions and contradictions that Labour failed adequately to expose became evident. The first was to convince their own party \u2013 and as much as possible the country \u2013 that they would deliver the will of the people and make a success of getting out of the European Union. Having concluded that immigration was the main factor behind the narrow Leave win, they felt they had to be crystal clear that Brexit would be both hard and clean, and that they would be ready to leave the EU single market, which the Conservative party has championed for decades, if that was what was needed to control immigration. The \u201cliberal elite\u201d who tried to soften Brexit and spoke up for the benefits of immigration and working with our partners were dismissed as sour, bad losers flouting democracy.</p> <p>The second aim was to showcase the personal vision of prime minister May, allowing her to explain how she intended to create \u201ca country that works for everyone, not just the privileged few\u201d. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/05/theresa-may-consigns-cameron-to-history-in-populist-speech\" title=\"\">May\u2019s first conference speech </a>as prime minister shunned the individualism of Margaret Thatcher and the shrinking-state Conservatism of her successors, including David Cameron, replacing all that with a commitment to an active state that would intervene wherever and whenever it could to help people \u201cacross the line\u201d. \u201cWe succeed or fail together,\u201d said May, recalling <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/sep/19/alistair-brownlee-jonny-world-triathlon-series\" title=\"\">one Brownlee brother dragging the other across the finishing line</a> in their recent triathlon success. \u201cWe achieve or fall short together. When one of us falters, our human instinct is to reach out our hand and help them over the line. There is more to life than individualism and self-interest,\u201d she declared, in what was intended to be a defining section of her speech.</p> <p>But just as budgets can unravel fast, so can conferences that play too much to the party gallery and then crash into reality. The hard Brexit lines looked like a pitch for Ukip votes. Ukip\u2019s main donor, Arron Banks, said the Tories had morphed into Ukip itself. Business was alarmed. The anti-immigrant dog whistling certainly did not sit easily with May\u2019s softer themes, her appeals to the centre ground, her talk of a global Britain, her pledges to help everyone succeed.</p> <p>On several occasions May and her ministers went too far and had to backtrack. No sooner had she suggested that foreign doctors would have to return home from 2025 once enough extra home-grown ones had been trained than she retracted it, saying this would not in fact be the case. The morning after Rudd had intimated that ministers would \u201cname and shame\u201d companies that employed too many foreign workers, she went on BBC radio to say this was \u201cnot something we\u2019re definitely going to do\u201d. The Tories were pulling to the right then to the left then back.</p> <p>Within Conservative ranks, fissures were exposed. Former minister Nick Herbert warned of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/02/beware-brexit-three-blind-mice-nick-herbert\" title=\"\">dangers of \u201cBrexit fundamentalism\u201d</a> while former education secretary Nicky Morgan said that hard Brexit would encourage people \u201cto say things about their fellow citizens that promote intolerance and bigotry\u201d.</p> <p>Some Tories, and even the <em>Daily Telegraph</em>, worried that the party might lose the support of business. The day after the conference, as the pound plummeted in reaction to all the Brexit noise and May\u2019s conference speech, in which she spoke of the \u201cbad side\u201d of low interest rates and quantitative easing, the chancellor, Philip Hammond, gave an interview in New York to row back a bit on the nationalist tone of his colleagues. Clearly worried, he made it clear that the UK was not shutting the door completely to the single market or free movement of labour. The British people had certainly voted, he told the Bloomberg news agency, not to have full \u201cfree movement\u201d of people. \u201c[But] that is not the same as \u2018we will not allow any people from the EU to come into the UK. It\u2019s about controls and processes,\u2019\u201d he said.</p> <p>Hammond also went out of his way to counter the delusion among many Tories that the economy was enjoying some sort of post-referendum boom, questioning the wisdom of papers such as the <em>Daily Mail</em> that had claimed day after day that all was wonderful in Brexit land. \u201cSadly, there is a part of the British press saying precisely that. The answer, of course, is that the data that the media is mostly focused on is backward-looking data, which tells us a very good news story, that the UK economy was more robust than we thought in the first half of this year.\u201d</p> <p>On Friday the pound suffered more dramatic and alarming fluctuations, including a short-term \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/07/theories-emerge-for-pounds-flash-crash-against-dollar\" title=\"\">flash crash</a>\u201d with analysts blaming concern over the UK government\u2019s approach to Brexit. Hammond appealed again for calm.</p> <p>The party conference season south of the border is over (the pro-EU SNP will meet in Glasgow this week). Tories have been sent back to their constituencies with simple hard Brexit messages. Some see through them to difficult times ahead. On Sunday former chancellor Kenneth Clarke will appear on the BBC\u2019s <em>Andrew Marr Show</em> and make clear his worries about leaving the single market. Other Tories are anxious about May\u2019s promotion of an active state and her new \u201cborrow to build\u201d approach. MPs in all parties want a vote in parliament on any decision to leave the single market. The CBI is on the warpath. But with Labour divided and incoherent on Europe, Jeremy Corbyn a lukewarm defender of the single market, and the Lib Dems struggling to be heard, the forgotten 48% lack a champion they can trust to hold back the Tory charge to the exit.</p> <p>Polling released on Sunday by the New Economics Foundation (Nef) shows that among Remain voters, 68% say they are likely to vote at the next general election according to how political parties deal with Brexit. Some 77% agreed that issues such as tax avoidance, climate change, international security and global poverty can only be tackled by working with other countries and that it would be bad for Britain if its government retreated from these global relationships. Marc Stears, Nef\u2019s chief executive, said the conferences had concentrated inevitably on the interests of those who wanted to leave. \u201cNo one has been very interested in the views of Remain voters. But the findings of this poll show that any political leader who turns their back on the 48%, seeking to diminish and jettison values like tolerance and internationalism, does so at their peril,\u201d he said.</p> <p>At the end of her speech on Wednesday, May appealed to the entire country to back her. \u201cTo everyone here this morning \u2013 and the millions beyond, whether Leavers or Remain \u2013 I say: come with me and we\u2019ll write that brighter future.\u201d She may have done enough to unite most if not all in her own party last week, but to many others outside it, including much of the business community, the future she spoke of looks darker than it did a week ago.</p>",
  "<p>Call off the search \u2013 as far as many Tories leaving Birmingham were concerned, the spiritual heir to Margaret Thatcher has finally arrived. The Conservative party has produced populists who weren\u2019t popular (Iain Duncan Smith, William Hague, Michael Howard) and finally a moderniser popular enough to get elected (David Cameron). Its secret anxiety has been that, throughout its post-Maggie journey, the party has lacked a convincing champion and a leader instinctively in touch with the fears and aspirations of working-class and lower middle-class people outside London. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/oct/05/theresa-may-speech-tory-conservative-conference-theresa-mays-speech-politics-live\" title=\"\">Inside the hall, </a>Theresa May needed to announce Usain Bolt Brexit \u2013 as quick as humanly possible \u2013 to shore up party support.</p> <p>May\u2019s target outside the hall was a far broader one. She is appealing to a widespread feeling that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/04/theresa-may-brexit-conservative-party-conference-speech-tories-centre-ground\" title=\"\">liberal elites have become complacent about the impact of immigration and globalisation</a> \u2013 and she has a point. If such elites are resolutely peevish about her tub-thumping language, it is in part because they recognise that their view was less persuasive than they hoped. Simply calling a phenomenon \u201cpopulism\u201d with a knowing sigh is a long way from having a vigorous response to it.</p> <p>The referendum result has cratered a wide political territory where liberal conservatism met rightwing social democracy. But it leaves the victrix in No&#xa0;10 searching for the right balm to offer the discontented multitudes on either side. The result is May\u2019s \u201cred Tory\u201d brew: heady and promising but also confusing. Her aides speak openly of the problems of \u201cworking-class voters\u201d \u2013 a phrase Cameron and Tony Blair tended to avoid.</p> <p>The remedy features economic nationalism (far less laissez-faire on which UK assets can be sold to China and with more pronounced securocratic tendencies). It embraces, at least rhetorically, the optimistic view that shaming employers into taking British workers will automatically result in them finding a willing and able workforce in the right places for the roles they need.</p> <p>A rallying cry for \u201ctax justice\u201d sounds very nice indeed \u2013 but recalls a slightly smug Ed Miliband fused with a punitive Jeremy Corbyn. What is fair tax, for whom and on what terms, will be as contested at the end of the May era as it is now. This is where more libertarian Tories, though out of fashion, have a point when they fret that May is overdoing the born-again statism. She will need policies that can address Mike Ashley\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/dec/09/how-sports-direct-effectively-pays-below-minimum-wage-pay\" title=\"\">Sports Direct work practices</a>, Philip Green\u2019s staff pension raids, internet search engines reluctant to hand over data to governments, cartel-like behaviour by energy companies \u2013 and balance the free-market dynamism that the UK will badly need to offset Brexit damage with more worker protection. Quite a to-do list \u2013 and each part of it will be fiercely contested.</p> <p>The promises of energetic interventionism \u2013 house-building and a Keynsian infrastructure boost \u2013 recall a mix of Michael Heseltine and parts of Blairiness. The difference? May thinks she can do it better, a very Maggie instinct. We should not underestimate the acumen of a woman who craftily played the referendum schisms to reach No 10, having been regarded by her predecessor as a member of the chorus line, rather than a star of the show.</p> <p>But confusion already reigns, over whether missteps like the<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/05/government-faces-backlash-from-business-leaders-over-foreign-workers\" title=\"\"> unpleasant flirtation with lists of foreign workers</a> were the result of a clumsiness or a harsher, more parochial undertone to May-ism. Politically, May knows her goal, which is to shore up support in a party that will shortly squabble over the Brexit recipe \u2013 by attracting wider appeal in the country. Hence the mix of anti-elite rhetoric and daring raids into those parts of the centre-left consigned to the bench in the Corbyn era. The appointment of Matthew Taylor (my fellow panellist on the BBC\u2019s <em>Moral Maze</em> and ex-Blair adviser) to an inquiry on how to improve workers\u2019 experience of today\u2019s changing employment patterns, is symbolic. Her team talk enthusiastically of \u201cindustrial strategy\u201d and worker representation on boards. Irony check: no sooner has Britain started to leave the EU than the Conservatives are embracing a German slurry of social and Christian democracy.</p> <p>Attacks on an excess of free market orthodoxy remind us that TM is more ideologically flexible than Mrs T. Her speech was a Merkel-esque grab at left-of-centre themes of discontent about under-addressed market failures, married to the \u201ccompassionate conservatism\u201d notion of mutual responsibility. (The May inner team has a slightly churchy feel, with a vicar\u2019s daughter at the helm.)</p> <p>But successful challenges to modern capitalism, as Miliband discovered, are not achieved by running an extended seminar on discontents. What matters is what can be done. Some May commitments are already overblown: threatening an expanded, all-powerful tax crackdown in the language of the Terminator: \u201cWe\u2019re coming after you,\u201d invites disappointment.</p> <p>Broader objections will coalesce around distaste at her hard-Brexit approach, an over-compensation for the prevalence of remainers on her top team. An afterlife role for George Osborne may soon open up here.</p> <p>May thinks she can combine the electorally useful (grabbing swing Labour voters who are not going to embrace Corbyn\u2019s far-left ideology), with her instinctive distaste for the \u201cenrichez-vous\u201d end of Conservatism. \u201cThere is more to life than individualism,\u201d was to every trained Tory ear a riposte to Thatcher\u2019s \u201cthere is no such thing as society\u201d. There surely is. But the state, while a powerful instrument, has a patchy record of success in many of the areas she wishes to address.</p> <p>Just as the foreign workers\u2019 lists was always a bad idea that was never going to be implemented, quite a lot of the notions expounded in Birmingham will not happen, or are more likely to dwindle into symbolic tweaks than revolution. Red Toryism is an intriguing hybrid, but a sprawling, contradictory one. For the May supremacy to flourish, she needs to decide which parts of it matter more to her than others.</p> <p><em>Anne McElvoy is senior editor at the Economist</em></p>",

  "<p>The National Trust has been accused of manipulating a family of \u201cexemplary\u201d tenants so it could evict them following an administrative muddle that left the charity potentially liable to pay compensation. Tam Hockey says she was \u201cduped\u201d after a coordinated campaign by trust employees to accept a refund of her security deposit. Hockey was told that giving back the deposit would help build \u201cmutual trust and understanding\u201d.</p> <p>In fact, internal emails show staff were secretly planning to evict the family, yet were unable to because the National Trust had not acted on a change in the law that affected about 1,900 of its tenants and leaves it potentially liable for compensation claims of up to \u00a35.7m.</p> <p>Four months after she cashed the cheque, Hockey, her partner Louis O\u2019Sullivan and their four children received an eviction notice ordering them to move out of their modest cottage on the Newark Park estate in Wotton-under-Edge in Gloucestershire.</p> <p>The National Trust\u2019s local property manager said that the family had to leave their home of 11 years because it was needed for storage, Hockey said. \u201cI was duped into accepting back our deposit so that [our property manager] could issue a Section 21 [eviction notice],\u201d she said. After she began fighting the eviction, Hockey obtained internal National Trust emails that showed it was concerned that it might breach the Deregulation Act 2015 if it tried to evict her. The <a href=\"http://nhas.org.uk/news/changes-to-section-21-notices-under-the-deregulation-act-2015\" title=\"\">act closed a loophole </a>that enabled landlords to avoid protecting tenants\u2019 security deposits for tenancies that began before 2007. According to the housing charity Shelter, any tenant whose deposit is not protected cannot be evicted, and tenants can claim penalty compensation of up to three times the amount of the deposit.</p> <p>The National Trust, which lets out about 4,500 domestic properties, had previously insisted on holding the money itself. Instead of protecting the deposits of about 1,900 tenants, it took the unusual step of returning the money \u2013 about \u00a31.9m \u2013 but many letters and cheques were not sent out until after the act came into force on 23&#xa0;June 2015. The trust refused to say how many deposits were returned by the deadline, or whether it had set aside money to meet potential penalty award claims from tenants that could add up to about \u00a35.7m.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.nationaltrusttenantsassociation.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Tenants Association of the National Trust</a> said it had \u201cexpressed deep concern at the highest levels of the National Trust\u201d over the decision to return the deposits. \u201cIt is disappointing to be involved in a case where the National Trust appears to have manipulated a reluctant tenant into cashing a deposit cheque in order for them to be able to serve a valid Section 21 notice,\u201d Joanna Leighton, its co-chair, said.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2014/jun/19/rogue-landlords-exploit-deposit-protection-loophole\">Rogue landlords exploit deposit protection loophole</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The National Trust has gone to extraordinary lengths to return some deposits. \u201cThe trust returned the deposit in an envelope stuffed with cash through our cat flap in the hours of darkness,\u201d said Robin Kisby, who is fighting eviction with his wife from their cottage in Cotehele in Cornwall.Hockey wanted to keep the money aside, but received several phone calls from the trust\u2019s finance department instructing her to cash the cheque. She was told to put the money into premium bonds, and that the cheque would expire after three months.</p> <p>The trust said it did not comment on individual tenancies but that it \u201chas made a policy decision not to continue to either hold or request deposits from current or new residential tenants\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cIn the face of the growing complexity and administrative burden placed on the charity in handling them [the deposits], we decided to focus instead on continuing to develop strong relationships with tenants locally,\u201d said the trust.</p> <p>The charity added that only a very small number of tenants had not cashed in their deposits.</p>",
  "<p>For many people, letting a room \u2013 or even an entire home \u2013 on Airbnb is an occasional helpful aid to paying off the mortgage. For others, the home letting website is a source of regular income which they factor into their monthly budget. But while renting via the website may seem as simple as posting property details online, the reality is more complex \u2013 and a recent court ruling could further complicate matters.</p> <p>Thousands of people who use the site to rent out their leasehold property are potentially breaching their leases, and could be in danger of losing their homes, according to a recent ruling from the Upper Tribunal (Lands Chamber), the highest property court in the land.</p> <p>Residents and occupiers of leasehold properties \u2013 mostly tenants and owners of flats \u2013 whose leases state that the property must be used as a \u201cprivate residence\u201d may now be prevented from renting out the homes for short terms of days and weeks. This clause is extremely common in leases.</p> <p>\u201cThe implications are enormous,\u201d says Nicole Rogers, a solicitor at DAS Law. \u201cMillions of Airbnb hosts may have unwittingly breached the terms of their lease by hosting visitors, and the ruling may now pave the way for freeholders to take action. Airbnb will surely suffer as a result.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2016/oct/02/airbnb-illegal-singapore-building-short-lets\">We arrived at our Airbnb booking in Singapore only to find it was illegal</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The verdict came after a case [see panel] where a woman fell out with her neighbours in a development in north London when she let out her flat via Airbnb and other similar websites. Residents asked the freeholder of the block to act and the case went to court.</p> <p>The judgment provides a clear legal precedent, says Giles Peaker, property disputes solicitor at Anthony Gold Solicitors. \u201cAnyone doing Airbnb lettings in a leasehold flat should immediately check their lease.\u201d</p> <p>The key question the court considered was whether a temporary occupation of an entire property by an Airbnb guest is consistent with the definition of the property as \u201ca private residence\u201d \u2013 and ruled it was not.</p> <p>Peaker says this means that if you own a leasehold flat defined as a private residence in the lease, and the freeholder discovers the entire flat is being let out to paying guests for short periods, you could be in breach.</p> <p>Airbnb, however, said this was a ruling on a specific lease, and therefore the judge\u2019s decision would not necessarily affect other hosts. \u201cWe ask all hosts to certify they have permission to list their space and remind them to check and follow local rules before they list their space and throughout the year. Our responsible hosting page also contains useful information and resources on the rules for home sharing,\u201d a statement from the company said.</p> <p>However, Peaker says the judge\u2019s finding is binding on lower courts and tribunals. The ruling does not appear to prevent letting out single rooms in your home, however. If you live permanently in the leasehold property, occupying at least one of the bedrooms every time your guests stay the night, the ruling shouldn\u2019t prohibit you from hosting. \u201cLetting out the whole property is the issue,\u201d Peaker says.</p> <p>There have, however, already been implications from the ruling \u2013 in one case a buyer pulled out from a purchase in the hours following the ruling, <em>the Observer</em> was told. Indeed, Lisa Gibbs, conveyancing partner at Simpson Millar, has started advising would-be Airbnb hosts not to buy leasehold properties which contain a \u201cprivate residence\u201d lease clause.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Anyone doing Airbnb lettings in a leasehold flat should immediately check their lease</p> <footer> <cite>Giles Peaker, solicitor</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>This is not the only clause which could raise problems. Another may prohibit you from subletting, underletting or otherwise \u201cparting with possession\u201d of the property. \u201cSuch clauses may amount to a blanket prohibition on holiday letting,\u201d says Gabrielle Moffatt, partner at Dean Wilson.</p> <p>Other common lease clauses may restrict occupation of the property to a single family, or prohibit use in a way that causes nuisance or annoyance to the occupiers of other flats. \u201cUltimately, there is a risk the leaseholder could lose their flat,\u201d says Kirsteen Durrant, senior lawyer at Howes Percival. Some leases may even allow neighbours in your building to enforce lease clauses without involving the freeholder.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Airbnb hosts who wish to remove a restrictive lease clause are likely to find the process very costly. \u201cYou\u2019d have to get the freeholder to agree to surrender your lease and grant a new one, and that could easily cost a few thousand pounds,\u201d Peaker says.</p> <p><strong>Mortgage awareness</strong></p> <p>Property leases are not the only potential pitfall for would-be renters. The Council of Mortgage Lenders (CML) says Airbnb hosts who offer short-term lets without seeking permission from their mortgage lender are \u201cvery likely\u201d to be breaking their mortgage contract. This applies to buy-to-let mortgages too \u2013 lenders generally do not allow short-term lets and predicate the mortgage on assured shorthold tenancy agreements of at least six months.</p> <p>This means if your lender discovers your property is being occupied by temporary Airbnb guests, it could theoretically call in the mortgage.</p> <p>If you fail to inform your lender \u2013 and the CML says they are unlikely to proactively check whether borrowers are Airbnb hosts \u2013 initially you\u2019ll probably get a warning that you need to stop hosting. If you persist, however, the lender could then seek repayment of the mortgage, says David Hollingworth of L&amp;C Mortgages.</p> <p><strong>Prison possibilities</strong></p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>If you don\u2019t tell your insurer about your home-host plans  it may refuse to pay any claims</p> <footer> <cite>Ben Wilson, Gocompare</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Criminal charges can be brought if a property is in Greater London and the resident lets any part of it out on a short-term basis for more than 90 days in any 365-day period. If you break this rule you get can fined up to \u00a320,000. \u201cThat\u2019s a breach of planning permission \u2013 so, a criminal offence \u2013 and you can be prosecuted for it in the magistrate\u2019s court,\u201d says Peaker. \u201cThere has already been a handful of local authorities who have brought proceedings, and I think more councils will do so.\u201d</p> <p>However, no matter where your property is, if your guests repeatedly cause a statutory nuisance to your neighbours, you could be served with an abatement order and penalised by your local authority.</p> <p><strong>Ensuring you are insured</strong></p> <p>As a result of all these issues, most landlords ban subletting on a short-term basis in their tenancy agreements, which means tenants who host on Airbnb face eviction.</p> <p>But even if you don\u2019t have a landlord, a lease, a London property, a mortgage or an irate neighbour, you may still fall foul of your insurer. Airbnb hosts who fail to inform their buildings and contents insurer about their paying guests are potentially risking the very&#xa0;fabric of their building, and everything in it.</p> <p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t tell your insurer about your home-host plans then it may refuse to pay any claims and your insurance could be invalidated,\u201d says Ben Wilson from Gocompare Home Insurance. It\u2019s also possible your insurer may increase your premiums or refuse to cover you for Airbnb \u2013 if this happens, you may be able to get a better deal from a specialist insurer like Towergate or Guardhog.com.</p> <p>Airbnb provides a \u201chost guarantee\u201d whereby it will \u201creimburse eligible hosts for damages up to \u00a3600,000\u201d. However, its website states that this should not be considered a replacement for homeowners or renters\u2019 insurance. It doesn\u2019t protect cash and securities, pets, reasonable wear and tear, or shared or common areas, and offers limited protection for jewellery, collectibles and artwork.</p> <p>In the UK, Airbnb also provides host protection insurance for hosts and landlords against liability claims up to \u00a3786,000 that occur in a listing, or an Airbnb property, during a stay. This protects you in the event of third party claims of bodily injury or property damage resulting from your guest\u2019s stay, but does not cover intentional acts or property issues.</p> <h2>Ruling has consequences for other hosts</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"fe46942b554c3491fbb0db297d4a7b8285c97701\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fe46942b554c3491fbb0db297d4a7b8285c97701/0_123_5616_3370/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Iveta Nemcova\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Iveta Nemcova: \u2018the ruling has far-reaching implications for other hosts\u2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Katherine Anne Rose/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Iveta Nemcova sees her loss in court as an injustice - not just for her but for other leaseholders.

The court disagreed, however, with Judge Stuart Bridge saying there needed to be \u201ca degree of permanence going beyond being there for a weekend or a few nights in the week\u201d.</p> <p>Now Nemcova wants Airbnb to fund further legal action. The company did not respond when asked.</p> <p>Nemcova says: \u201cWe cannot afford to appeal to the high courts. We\u2019ve spent \u00a37,000 on legal costs already. Airbnb would be silly not to, because the ruling has far-reaching implications for other hosts. It will lose its entire business in the UK. Every freeholder in the country is going to be using this ruling to try to repossess a property.\u201d</p> <p>But following the ruling, Airbnb said it was specific to this case only.</p> <p>Nemcova\u2019s troubles began after a guest threw a party in her one-bed flat in Enfield Island Village. \u201cThe next day we evicted those guests,\u201d Nemcova says. However, a fellow leaseholder in her building decided to inform the freeholder of the building that Nemcova was letting her flat on Airbnb, and her freeholder took her to court for breaching her lease.</p> <p>\u201cI think leases should be abolished. Freeholders basically control your life. If you buy a flat, it should be yours,\u201d Nemcova says. She has since ceased letting the flat on Airbnb, and is renting it out permanently to one tenant. \u201cWe\u2019ve given up. You cannot fight the system.\u201d</p>",

There are scenes of despair but also of bittersweet joy as families remember their babies in moving ceremonies or conceive again.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2012/jan/22/losing-iris-stillborn-sarah-hughes\">The child I lost</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cOne of the things no one ever says about stillbirth is how it affects every area of your life,\u201d says Mel Scott, an occupational therapist from Somerset whose baby, Finley, died during labour. \u201cI felt really isolated after Finley died.

Muted title sound, yet an opening sequence of such technical magnificence it looked as if it had been beamed back to us from about 2048. The fetlocks of horses were being 3D-modelled with filigree\u2019d and granular precision, as were the noses of crooked barmen (as if there\u2019s any other kind) and doughty sheriffs, and the very ivories of nags\u2019 teeth and of pianolas, and suddenly we were into Westworld, a panorama of haughty big skies, aching beauty and spitefully small human dreams.</p> <p>A world, in case you missed all the media hype (and where on earth were you? Possessing a life?), in which guests will pay handsomely for a week or so in a wild west in which they can go riotously tootsie: sleep with every perfumed whore, gut-shoot every sweaty dog-breath hoodlum. Even, if addled and bourbonned enough, shag the bandit and gun the girl. They\u2019re all robots, programmed to hurt and bleed like us, but also to wake the next day mended and with no memories.</p> <p>It\u2019s an intriguing premise, of course, and, of course it will all go wrong: a sudden aberrant line of source code will risk not only the lives of the guests but, more crucially, the psyches of the androids in the park, who suddenly have twitches of memories. For the moment, we care more about the robots, who seem more human than the visitors, who cannot be physically harmed in the park: a depressing number have chosen to go all black hat with their moneyed freedom, murdering and fornicating at any whim: be advised that this is often nasty viewing.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eX3u0IlBBO4\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/eX3u0IlBBO4?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eX3u0IlBBO4\">Watch a trailer for Westworld.</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>It could have been just another tricksy CGI fantasy. But it came from the pen of Michael Crichton, responsible for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/jurassic-park\"><em>Jurassic Park</em></a>, which also asked pertinent questions about humanity and technology. I would happily class Crichton with Ray Bradbury and Philip K Dick, because they also wrote wisely about ourselves: even when it might have been spuriously about robots, or dinosaurs, it was always about us. What might we do? Are we happy with discovering the people we truly are or only happy with the people we want to be? And if you can\u2019t tell the difference between the humans and the androids, should it matter?</p> <p>This is existentially and morally mired, in that it raises questions not of the narrative in itself but of us, the reader/viewer. This opener was tremendously, deliberately confusing: the good guy is a robot, the bad guy (a tremendous Ed Harris, playing the part he was born to play) a veteran vicious tourist on the hunt for darker levels, to assuage all he lacks in real life, which is shaping up as a howdy-doody lot of a lack. It\u2019s all rather scintillating, not least because if features <em>Borgen</em>\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2012/feb/01/sidse-babett-knudsen-borgens-appeal\">Sidse Babett Knudsen</a> as the searingly blue-eyed head of quality assurance, off stage and chain-smoking high on the controllers\u2019 gantry, intent not on money but simple control: of robots, the \u201clivestock\u201d, but also of every human around her.</p> <p>Could it be a worthy successor to <em>GoT</em>? Absolutely. HBO has another global heavyweight on its hands, thanks to the authors: I\u2019m hooked, in a way I never was with early <em>Thrones</em>. Again: this is not about robots: it\u2019s about us. Yet every time I am tempted to worry about robots taking over the world any time before about 2416 I simply think of self-service tills.

In Iceland, where they have had the test for a while, every positive diagnosis for Down\u2019s has resulted in termination: 100% in the past five years. There are now fewer than 40,000 people with Down\u2019s in Britain. Phillips, whose dear son Olly is one, made a passionate yet refreshingly unsentimental case for the right to have Down\u2019s extant in this world. It\u2019s not a disease, it\u2019s a set of characteristics (and ones that, actually, genetically predispose the child to happiness).</p> <p>Hugely set against this comes the understandable set of fears of any mother: of an inability to cope, of a child\u2019s being bullied, even of their own prejudices. Yet Down\u2019s remains the one disability it has become socially acceptable to \u201ccleanse\u201d and Sally was more than troubled (as was I) by medical professionals\u2019 universal embracing of one and only one tenet: Down\u2019s is always bad, choice is always good. This lucid and strangely uplifting programme should be only the very beginning of a debate we should have been busily having for about 30 years.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m the business equivalent of a diamond.

committee on Wednesday were \u201cslightly less severe\u201d than the Newman government\u2019s Vicious Lawless Association Disestablishment Act (Vlad), which mandated 15 to 25 years extra punishment for gang crimes.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a

crime crackdown</a> </p> </aside>  <p> O\u2019Gorman said mandatory sentencing remained fundamentally unjust and unfair, and could lead to the \u201coutright absurdity\u201d a court being forced to send a defendant to jail for seven years for a crime that would otherwise not have attracted a jail term.</p> <p>He pointed to the supply of recreational amounts of cannabis within a group of friends as potentially triggering the extra punishment under the proposed \u201cserious organised crime circumstance of aggravation\u201d.</p> <p>The Palasczuk government has retained the mandatory sentencing measure as a tool intended to help investigators break the code of silence that protects organised crime groups. </p> <p> Other sweeping reforms proposed in the government\u2019s serious and organised crime legislation amendment bill include consorting laws and raising maximum jail terms for child exploitation and drug trafficking.</p> <p>The only way of evading extra jail time for a gang crime would be to provide useful cooperation to police in a serious criminal investigation.</p> <p>In notes to the draft laws, the government says that is among amendments that \u201cpotentially breach the fundamental legislative principle\u201d of the Legislative Standards Act 1992, which requires laws to have sufficient regard to individual rights and liberties.</p> <p>But this was justified because the punishment would only apply to someone the state proved beyond reasonable doubt was \u201ca participant in a criminal organisation\u201d who committed a prescribed offence \u201cat the direction of, in association with, or for the benefit of a criminal organisation or a participant in a criminal organisation\u201d, the notes state. </p> <p>O\u2019Gorman said these prescribed offences included money laundering, which could capture someone who was handed $100 by a bikie looking to buy a bag of dope for personal use.</p> <p>The government kept mandatory sentencing in the draft, despite a committee for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/apr/04/queensland-to-dump-bikies-anti-association-laws\">the Wilson taskforce review into organised crime laws</a> voting four to two against mandatory sentencing, with only police unions in favour.</p> <p>But O\u2019Gorman said the government appeared to have since made its decision by consulting police and merely briefing the other parties, including the Queensland Bar Association and Queensland Law Society.</p> <p>The Wilson taskforce report noted concerns including the unjust effect of mandatory sentencing on Indigenous communities in Western Australia and the Northern Territory and in people smuggling cases.<br></p> <p>It also noted that mandatory sentencing was an incentive for an accused to provide false information in the hope that they could avoid the sentence.</p> <p>The QCCL called on state parliament crossbenchers to reject the seven-year mandatory sentencing to avoid \u201cserious miscarriages of justice\u201d.</p> <p>One of those crossbenchers, Rob Pyne has indicated he expected crossbench opposition to such measures and others, including a ban on wearing bikie colours in public, was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/sep/14/bikie-colours-likely-to-be-banned-in-new-queensland-organised-crackdown\">unlikely to prevail</a>.</p> <p>This was because the Liberal National party was unlikely to oppose any parts of Labor\u2019s gang laws package on civil liberties grounds, Pyne said.</p> <p>O\u2019Gorman said the high court\u2019s observation that under Vlad it was \u201cquite possible that a person who would not receive a custodial sentence in the lower range of seriousness (for the offence the person was arrested for) would nevertheless be sentenced to a mandatory 25 years\u2019 imprisonment\u201d held for the new laws.</p> <p>The explanatory notes to the Palaszczuk government bill state that: \u201cIf the base component (the sentence a person gets for the offence that person was arrested for) does not require the offender to immediately serve a sentence of imprisonment, the offender is to immediately begin to serve the mandatory component\u201d.</p> <p>O\u2019Gorman said: \u201cWe will inevitably witness the spectre of a person fabricating evidence and falsely accusing someone of a crime that they have not committed in order to avoid the mandatory sentence.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cA regime of mandatory minimum sentencing arguably can spawn, as in other jurisdictions here and overseas, police corruption.</p> <aside

One of those round spindly stands used for oyster platters is placed on the table. On top of that goes a thick wooden breadboard. On top of that is a torn piece of greaseproof paper, printed with a facsimile of an Italian sports newspaper. On top of that are wedges of toasted bread smeared with tooth-baringly acidic mayo, and on top of that, finally, are the ingredients that we actually ordered as part of the sharing three cicchetti platter. Blimey, I didn\u2019t know whether to eat it or strap on crampons and scale it.</p> <p>I\u2019ll come back to those toppings in a moment, because it\u2019s worth examining his restaurant in a little more detail first. D\u2019Acampo already has a bunch of \u201cMy Pasta\u201d bars. This, the second of his \u201cpremium\u201d brand ventures \u2013 the first is in Manchester \u2013 sits on the new mezzanine at Euston. You can eat outside on the eggshell-blue leather benches looking out over the concourse, listening for your train. Better still, go inside where there\u2019s a long open kitchen with two ovens, their flames guttering invitingly. The staff, mostly pretty Italian boys, occasionally look a little startled, like kids left in charge of the grown-up\u2019s shop, but they are eager and friendly. There are shelves of produce and, of course, stacks of D\u2019Acampo\u2019s books. Almost all menu items come with a book and page reference should you wish to recreate these crimes against Italian food at home later.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I didn\u2019t know whether to eat it or strap on crampons and scale it</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The walls are plastered with moody black and white photos of Gino with baffled-looking celebrities: here Jerry Springer, there Donny Osmond, over there Keanu Reeves, his dark anguished eyes screaming: \u201cHelp me! Please.\u201d And yet for all the overt sleb stupidity, this could be a sanctuary for travellers caught between trains. God knows there have been times on my travels when I would have killed for somewhere comfortable to rest up. It\u2019s colourful and warming. Two women with large suitcases pull up at the bar, flirt lightly with the waiter and order strawberry daiquiris. They sip and they sigh.</p> <p>Here, as ever, is what I don\u2019t understand. Why spend all this money \u2013 on the waiter\u2019s natty outfits, the marble bar tops, the open ovens, the glassware, and the photos of Gino with Donny \u2013 and then produce such mediocre food? Compared to the other costs, a good cook is cheap.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1afedfd3be77df88787f3be8e90faabefa64c63c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1afedfd3be77df88787f3be8e90faabefa64c63c/0_455_4465_2679/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018The \u00a316 price tag for this is on the utterly shameless side of enthusiastic\u2019: cicchetti.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018The \u00a316 price tag for this is on the utterly shameless side of enthusiastic\u2019: cicchetti.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sophia Evans/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Not everything is terrible. The best espresso at Euston station is almost certainly served here. It is dark and nutty and powerful. The tiramisu is a model of its kind. It\u2019s not overly sweet and has a fine balance of cream to sponge. They make good zucchini fritti, which is not easy. One of those cicchetti toppings is a pleasing salad of spiralised courgette and fennel with salty capers and the punch of good, peppery olive oil.</p> <p>But everything else seems to be trying to make up its mind whether to be awful or just plain odd. The other two cicchetti are four seared king prawns, not all of which have been cooked through, lending the centre a grey translucence, and small lumps of breaded cod. Some are overcooked and some are under. The \u00a316 price tag for this is on the utterly shameless side of enthusiastic. The tomatoes in a salad with mozzarella have been rendered completely tasteless courtesy of a long journey through the fridge.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"4a971ddb46581b8a5788b2d4be6b6d0c09c9294f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4a971ddb46581b8a5788b2d4be6b6d0c09c9294f/0_209_5464_3278/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Look out for the langoustine: seafood linguine.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Look out for the langoustine: seafood linguine.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sophia Evans/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The risotto with scallops is where hope goes to die. The rice is claggy and completely overcooked; each traumatised grain looks like it\u2019s been roughed up down a dark alleyway. Around the edges a pool of fat has started to separate out. It\u2019s dotted with four scallops that have seized up in the heat. Make that three and a half scallops. One of them is missing the best of itself. Still, I suppose it was there in the fridge when the order came in, why not throw it into the pot? Nobody will notice. Or perhaps they will.</p> <p>The same attention to margins and gross profit appears to apply to the seafood linguine. I do a count. There\u2019s one big prawn, two mussels, two rings of calamari cooked to the rubber-band stage, and four clams. For \u00a313.50. I check the menu. It also mentions a langoustine. I fork through the pasta. Where\u2019s my bloody langoustine? I raise it with a waiter, who takes it up with the head chef in the open kitchen. And so I get to witness one of the best bored shrugs I\u2019ve seen in a long time. They\u2019re completely out of langoustine so, y\u2019know\u2026 They take the dish off the bill.</p> <p>The pasta is serviceable, but the tomato sauce has the brisk metallic whack of something that needs so much longer on the heat. Overall the dish tastes of rigorous and attentive accountancy. The same sauce turns up with veal meatballs that are hard and unyielding, first to the fork then the teeth. On the menu D\u2019Acampo says: \u201cIf you like meatballs, you simply must try these.\u201d Well I do, Gino, and I did.

  "<h2>Wild West: America\u2019s Great Frontier<br> 8pm, BBC2</h2> <p>It\u2019s vista television time, as Auntie explores the great American wilderness. In the first of three episodes, that means visits to places where rain rarely falls: the deserts of Nevada, the cactus-dotted landscapes of Arizona, and California\u2019s heat-blasted Mojave. Along the way, we learn how creatures such as mustangs and desert tortoises have become adapted to environments where getting enough food and water to survive is a constant issue. <em>Jonathan Wright </em></p> <h2>Sir Chris Hoy: 200mph At Le Mans<br> 9pm, BBC2</h2> <p>Competing in the Le Mans <br> 24-hour race was one of Chris Hoy\u2019s childhood dreams. And since he\u2019s struggled with the empty hours opened up by his retirement from cycling, giving it a go seemed only logical. This film tracks his entry into motorsport, but the racing itself is less interesting than the insight into Hoy\u2019s self-absorbed restlessness; presumably a characteristic he shares with other sporting high-achievers. <em>Phil Harrison</em></p> <h2>Victoria<br> 9pm, ITV</h2> <p>The heavily pregnant Victoria strives for a bit of autonomy in the final episode. \u201cLook!\u201d she beams as their carriage clip-clops through the throng, \u201cHow happy people are to see us!\u201d Which obviously doesn\u2019t include some proto-Farage, who rushes her coach to free her from the \u201cGerman tyrant\u201d. Or, indeed, the man from the Young England Society who shoots at the royal couple. Can the script shoehorn in a \u201cWe are not amused\u201d? It surely can. <em>Ali Catterall</em></p> <h2>Celebrity Island With Bear Grylls<br> 9pm, Channel 4</h2> <p>Things you never thought you\u2019d see happen, even in your weirdest reality TV dreams: Karen Danczuk is chasing down a crocodile. Yes, it\u2019s the final episode of the Stand Up To Cancer fundraising show, and the celebrity inhabitants are getting desperate. After a relaxed day off, the hungry mob are on the verge of eating each other, so Danczuk leads a hunting party in the hope of catching a croc. Will they survive or perish for a good cause? <em>Hannah Verdier</em></p> <h2>Trump vs Clinton Live: US Presidential Debate<br> 1.35am, Channel 4</h2> <p>After Donald Trump\u2019s sub-prime performance at the first debate \u2013 where he bloviated, sniffled and later muttered darkly about his microphone \u2013 the Republican nominee will be hoping to appear stronger in round two. Whether tonight\u2019s lectern-free town-hall format, with the candidates fielding questions from floating voters in St Louis, will play to his unique oratorical strengths remains to be seen. <em>Graeme Virtue </em></p> <h2>Hitler: The Rise And Fall<br> 9pm, More4</h2> <p>Adolf Hitler embodies a warning from history that cannot be overlooked, but this is far from the first series analysing his rise to leave one wondering if there is much left to be said. It\u2019s the standard assemblage of solemn experts, silly reconstructions, portentous voiceover, familiar archive footage and pompous soundtrack. This second episode chronicles the Nazis\u2019 emergence as a genuine political force in early 1930s Germany. <em>Andrew Mueller</em></p> <h2>Robbie Coltrane\u2019s Critical Evidence<br> 10pm, CI</h2> <p>Having been on the other side of the (fictional) justice fence of late as a popular entertainer accused of sexual assault in National Treasure, Robbie Coltrane\u2019s now firmly back on the right side of the law with this new series on crime-scene forensics. This first episode sees him explore a 2002 murder in Cambridgeshire, where a tiny scrap of paper proved a crucial piece of the puzzle.

  "<p>Everyone assumes that lead poisoning is no longer a real risk, and that the horror story of lead-laced water in Flint, Michigan, would mean that the only safe amount is no lead at all.</p> <p>Yet lead is still in use and that means we run the risk of exposure. In the UK we still subscribe to 40-year-old legislation that permits some concentrations of lead (products must contain less than 2,500 parts per 1,000,000).</p> <p>Fortunately, <a href=\"https://www.plymouth.ac.uk/staff/andrew-turner\">Dr Andrew Turner</a>, reader in environmental science at Plymouth University, is on the case. I spent a day with him in Bristol as he fired an XRF spectrometer (a type of laser gun) at climbing frames and seesaws. What bounced back were readings showing toxic levels of lead, mainly from paint used to coat play-park equipment.</p> <p>Some of Turner\u2019s research has shown amounts 40 times greater than legal levels. Lead can remain in the body for 30 years and its toxicity affects bodily systems including the kidneys. It can also interfere with enzymes, and have irreversible effects on the central nervous system.</p> <p>Once lead is introduced into the environment, you can\u2019t get rid of it. Decades of research by <a href=\"http://www.bris.ac.uk/social-community-medicine/people/alan-m-emond/index.html\">Professor Alan Emond</a> and his team at the University of Bristol shows that lead at low levels can have an impact on child development. The team followed some children into adulthood and discovered that exposure to lead early in childhood can affect educational attainment, as well as levels of hyperactivity and antisocial behaviour.</p> <p>So it would be great to find out why, or how, local authorities are commissioning play equipment that is still using lead paint. Until then, there\u2019s no need to panic \u2013 but neither is there an excuse for toxic swings and roundabouts.</p> <h2>The big picture: Wildscreen\u2019s eco exhibition</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8042e96797da26b52a18b623529840c1052df0cd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8042e96797da26b52a18b623529840c1052df0cd/0_266_3984_2390/1000.jpg\" alt=\"No monkey business: a memorable image from Wildscreen 2016.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">No monkey business: a memorable image from Wildscreen 2016.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jasper Doest</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Bristol is a hub for natural history photography and this prowess is showcased in Wildscreen 2016, a free exhibition running until 28 October, celebrating storytelling about the natural world.

Henderson is ordered to go and take the belt, but Bisping again pins him on the fence, whiffing with a spinning high kick. Bisping is trying to control the range with kicks, staying out of the way of that hilarious right while scoring points. Henderson\u2019s corner scream at him to finish the fight and he\u2019s in the centre now trying to land punches, depositing a knee to the midriff before resting against the fence.</p> <p>Bisping has huge swelling under his left eye and for a moment is pinned on the cage. He gets away, but Henderson takes him down! He can\u2019t do anything with it, but the judges might like it in what is a much closer round. Hendo with another takedown and Bisping might use it to get on top, but limp-legs out instead. Flying knee from Bisping as the clappers go, Henderson tries some kind of cartwheel kick, and that\u2019s that! <strong>What a fight!

I wonder if Bisping might try a takedown - he has nasty ground-and-pound, and Henderson won\u2019t enjoy carrying his weight. </p> <p>Henderson shuffles around the outside, then takes a kick to the box. The ref tells Bisping that he\u2019ll think about taking a point next time, while Henderson should take all of his allotted five minutes. The crowd boo and Bisping encourages them on the basis that Henderson is taking advantage . . . of being cracked in the dress circle. Er, ok. </p> <p>They resume and it\u2019s more of the same, Bisping doing most of the work. But suddenly Henderson is coming forward more than at any time in the fight landing a right and leg kick - he might not rate Bisping\u2019s power. \u201cDan Henderson makes Chuck Norris wet the bed,\u201d says Stann. Bisping eats a knee just before the bell, but that\u2019s another to him; this final one promises to be an absolute banger. <strong>Bisping 10-9 Henderson.</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fe833654bbf72626d6cae3a138ffafc001ce1c73\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fe833654bbf72626d6cae3a138ffafc001ce1c73/0_0_1537_922/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Michael Bisping is bloodied and bruised.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Michael Bisping is bloodied and bruised.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Pete Byrne/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-10-09T15:51:19.385Z\">at 4.51pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57f9c203e4b05c2f1e953870\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-09T04:10:16.844Z\">5.10am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Round 3</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>We know what happens now. Bisping pushes the pace, lands some decent shots, while Henderson waits. Perhaps Bisping should try a few more kicks, because thanks to that new left hook he\u2019s learnt, he\u2019s having trouble stopping the right over the top of it - previously, his problem was avoiding left hands. Both these guys are such incredible competitors, what a scrap this is! Henderson goes for the takedown, can\u2019t complete it, and he\u2019s breathing heavily. Bisping uncorks a right, then a kick and then a left, but none land clean, then another right from Henderson finds a home - he grins. <strong>Bisping 10-9 Henderson</strong>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5c5dbf60510d511662c04057c3291f1e97a2c745\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5c5dbf60510d511662c04057c3291f1e97a2c745/0_0_3992_2841/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Michael Bisping throws a left at Dan Henderson.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"712\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Michael Bisping throws a left at Dan Henderson.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Matthew Childs/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-10-09T15:51:35.145Z\">at 4.51pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57f9c075e4b03258bcac5cf2\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-09T04:05:21.462Z\">5.05am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Round 2</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Bisping again pushing the pace, throwing a lead left-hook - the same one that missed, allowing Henderson to land that humungous right. Bisping finds a home for a couple of looping rights and he\u2019s looking good again - but he was in the last round as well, before he wasn\u2019t. </p> <p>Bisping digs to the body with a left, than comes from the other side with a right kick - Henderson skips away. He looks to be taking this round off, but Bisping rocks him with a right to the jaw, presses forwards, boots him in the groin - the referee does nothing - and then, after missing with a left, gets knocked down with another right, an overhand! What a weapon that is! It\u2019s like something in a cartoon! Henderson follows him down, Bisping hangs on, and both fighters will probably take that. But if it\u2019s enough to steal Henderson the round, Bisping needs to win all three remaining for a draw. I\u2019d go <strong>Bisping 10-10 Henderson.</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8bf0b3c27e60adad9107b141810bda44e69875bc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8bf0b3c27e60adad9107b141810bda44e69875bc/0_0_3448_2069/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Dan Henderson, top, grapples with Michael Bisping.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dan Henderson, top, grapples with Michael Bisping.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Pete Byrne/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-10-09T15:44:39.577Z\">at 4.44pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57f9bf0be4b0e4aaeaa8d69b\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-09T03:58:44.294Z\">4.58am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Round 1</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Bisping is sitting down on his punches, taking the centre of the ring while Henderson waits for the big shot, right hand cocked by his chin.

Both men are waiting for the opportunity, as the crowd sing \u201cstand up if you love Bisping\u201d. Henderson doesn\u2019t seem to have much in the way of ideas, but then an overhand right goes close and Bisping is bleeding from an eye. Bisping misses with a left hoo, Henderson lands a giant right hand and Bisping goes down! Henderson follows him down and tries to finish but Bisping holds on, ceding his back then bouncing up!

Even now, in a division which which includes Chris Weidman, Jacare Souza, Yoel Romero and Gegard Mousasi, it seems like it cannot be . . . and yet it is.</p> <p>It is a triumph of belief, attitude and heart. Every time Bisping neared a title shot; every time he fought someone elite, you might say; every time he fought someone chemically enhanced, he might say; he came up short.

Henderson, who will retire after this fight whatever happens, is neither meant to win nor expected to win; he\u2019s lost six of his last nine fights, four of those by knockout or stoppage, and he\u2019s 46 years old. Just consider that for a moment: 46 years old. At 46 years old, there is nothing in the world he wants to do more than put himself through the mental and physical torture of yet another training camp, to earn the reward of a fight in a cage. He is not like us.</p> <p>On the face of it, this is a gimme for Bisping, a reward from his bosses for his years of toil and trashtalk. But the last thing any fighter loses is his punch \u2013 and if there\u2019s one thing Hendo knows how to do, it\u2019s that.

In America, Republicans have nominated for president a man with no regard for global norms and little enough for the American constitution. </p> <p>What is important, but far from obvious, is that these two trends \u2013 this careening toward a new digital age on the one hand and this descent into political darkness on the other \u2013 are closely related. </p> <p>History suggests that periods of great economic change are also times of political and social difficulty. We must recognise that the present is no exception. It is our failure to recognise and address the difficulties created by the digital revolution that has helped usher us to this troubling political moment. There could be more trouble ahead. The digital revolution is beginning to teach us what a tectonic economic transformation feels like. It is putting us in the shoes of our great-great-grandparents: those who first experienced the transmission of a human voice across an electrical wire, who watched as the time to travel from one city to a distant other shrank from weeks to hours and who found themselves displaced as smiths or farmhands by fantastic new technologies. We have all found our working lives altered by it.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a44dbb44f65e2f1d386341e374751bbe2cb01500\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a44dbb44f65e2f1d386341e374751bbe2cb01500/0_336_2971_1782/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Today\u2019s technology is disrupting life, just as the machines of the Industrial Revolution destroyed the work patterns of our great-great grandparents.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Today\u2019s technology is disrupting life, just as the machines of the Industrial Revolution destroyed the work patterns of our great-great grandparents.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Topical Press Agency/Getty</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Today\u2019s economic revolution produces concern and not simply about the uncertainty of employment in the years to come. Those of us who currently appear to have job security can more than likely look forward to making less in the future than we had once hoped we might. Over the last couple of decades, wages, adjusted for inflation, have scarcely grown throughout a broad range of rich countries, longer in some cases. And this wage stagnation has occurred alongside other distressing trends. The share of income flowing to workers, as opposed to business and property owners, has fallen. And, among workers, there has been a sharp rise in inequality, with the share of income going to those earning the highest incomes increasing in an astounding fashion.</p> <p>Then there is the sobering data on employment. In America, the share of adult men of prime working age who are working or actively looking for work has fallen steadily, in some cases dramatically, over the last generation. Among all men, the rate of participation in the workforce dropped from about <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/page/files/20160620_cea_primeage_male_lfp.pdf\">76% in 1990 to 69% in 2015. </a>That may not sound especially worrying, but it corresponds to a difference of about 9 million men.</p> <p>And those squeezed out of work often find their lives upended. Stuck in atrophying communities with few prospects, many struggle to find purpose and satisfaction in life; indeed, recent research has turned up an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2015/nov/02/death-rate-middle-aged-white-americans-aids\">alarming rise in mortality since the late 1990s among middle-aged white Americans</a>, mostly accounted for by an increase in suicides and in drug and alcohol abuse. The authors see economic insecurity as a contributing factor.</p> <p>This trend is not limited to America and neither can it be explained away as the product of ageing and retirement. In Europe, one in five adults under the age of 25 is unemployed. Across the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/oecd\">Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development</a> (OECD), 12% of people aged between 15 and 29 are neither in school nor work. Some are engaged in illicit activity or are in jail; others are in their parents\u2019 basements playing video games. Much the same is true of the long-term unemployed, many of them older men without much education, who drift around, often drinking to pass the day, lacking much, if any, connection to society at large.</p> <p>For an awful lot of people, work has become a less certain and often less remunerative contributor to material security. But work is not just the means by which we obtain the resources needed to put food on the table. It is also a source of personal identity. It helps give structure to our days and our lives. It offers the possibility of personal fulfilment that comes from being of use to others and it is a critical part of the glue that holds society together and smooths its operation. Over the last generation, work has become ever less effective at performing these roles. That, in turn, has placed pressure on government services and budgets, contributing to a more poisonous and less generous politics. Meanwhile, the march of technological progress continues, adding to the strain.</p> <p><strong>Either society will develop ways to shore up work or find substitutes</strong><br></p> <p>The digital revolution alters work in three ways. The first is through automation. New technologies are replacing certain workers, from clerks to welders, and will replace more in the future, from drivers to paralegals.<br></p> <p>At the same time, the digital revolution has supercharged a second force: globalisation. It would have been nearly impossible for rich western firms to manage the sprawling global supply chains that have been wrapped around the world over the past 20 years without powerful information technology. And while China and other emerging markets might have become better integrated in the world economy even without companies such as Apple scattering production across the globe, such growth would have been much slower and less dramatic. Instead, global employment grew by over a billion jobs over the last generation, with most of the growth occurring in emerging economies.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"41cfe51e84d520e67fbd8df459e0a6c1ede19180\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/41cfe51e84d520e67fbd8df459e0a6c1ede19180/0_243_3453_2073/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Globalisation of western companies has helped the growth of China and other emerging economies.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Globalisation of western companies has helped the growth of China and other emerging economies.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: STR/AFP/Getty</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Third, technology provides a massive boost to the productivity of some highly skilled workers, allowing them to do work that it might previously have taken many more people to accomplish. Technology enables small teams of money managers to run vast funds; it is increasingly allowing highly skilled instructors to build courses that can be taken and retaken by millions of students, potentially replacing hundreds or even thousands of lecturers. New technology is allowing fewer doctors and nurses to observe and treat many more patients, fewer lawyers to pore over vastly more trial-related evidence and fewer researchers to sift through massive amounts of data and test more hypotheses more quickly.</p> <p>These three trends \u2013 automation, globalisation and the rising productivity of a highly skilled few \u2013 are combining to generate an abundance of labour: a wealth of humans. In its struggle to digest this unprecedentedly enormous ocean of would-be workers, the global economy is misfiring in worrying ways. And the institution of work \u2013 apart from family, our most important piece of social infrastructure \u2013 can no longer be counted on to fulfil its many crucial roles, from the ordering of our days, to the allocation of purchasing power, to the strengthening of the social ties that are nurtured when individuals feel as though they are contributing positively to the community. Workers are unlikely to take these woes lying down. Something has to give. Either society will find ways to shore up work or develop substitutes for it or workers will use the political system to undermine the forces disrupting their world.</p> <p>This should be a good problem for mankind to have. An abundance of labour is arguably the point, to the extent that there is one, of technological progress. It is the beginning of the end of the need to work hard to stay alive. A system in which people actively seek out labour they would strongly prefer not to do \u2013 manning call centres to handle the complaints of unhappy customers or carrying packages around a boiling warehouse, for example \u2013 is not one society ought to aim to preserve any longer than technologically necessary.</p> <p>Yet the hardest part in finding utopia is not the figuring out of how to produce more. We\u2019ve managed that. The hard part is the redistribution. Crafting a balance of work and redistribution that is sustainable is incredibly difficult. The rich and privileged don\u2019t want to subsidise the poor. The poor may conclude that what redistribution the rich offer leaves an impossibly huge, even unfair gap in the incomes of the haves and have-nots. The poor may also not be content with an economy in which they are effectively unnecessary, kept at peace by a hand-out from the state. If redistribution is managed too clumsily, the incentive for clever or ambitious individuals to work to improve the economy might be lost, leading to stagnant growth and too little social surplus with which to provide all members of society with a rising standard of living.</p> <p>The battle lines of the great social upheaval are already being drawn. Their defining questions: who deserves credit for generating economic bounty and who has the right to claim a share of that bounty once it has been generated? Many of those earning top incomes, in individualist America in particular, believe they are the overtaxed \u201cmakers\u201d in society. But a makers-and-takers conception of the world is one that neglects the social foundation on which wealth is built. We aren\u2019t merely divided into makers and takers. We are participants in societies, operating according to a broad social consensus. When that consensus breaks down, the wealth goes away. Society either agrees a way to share its riches that most members find acceptable or the system fractures and the social wealth available to everyone shrinks.</p> <p>The social nature of wealth, always important, is increasingly critical. The long process of cultural development that eventually yielded the Industrial Revolution was in many ways the process by which humanity learned ever better ways of structuring society in order to foster the emergence of complex economic activity. The digital revolution is increasing the importance of social wealth in two key ways.</p> <p>First, new technologies increase our potential productivity and output as a society; because we are capable of becoming richer thanks to digital technology, the economic return to economically important social institutions, such as a government capable of enforcing private property rights, is rising. The gap between the incomes of societies capable of supporting these institutions and those that cannot is growing. In 1980, Americans were 30 times richer than residents of the Central African Republic. In 2015, they were 90 times richer.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The better countries become at sharing social wealth, the greater the pressure to shrink the circle of social membership</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>And second, the small-scale economic processes that generate new knowledge and turn it into profitable, welfare-enhancing activity are also becoming more social, and less individual, in nature. The value-generating pieces of successful companies were once satisfyingly tangible, consisting of buildings and machines, patents and people. That is ever less the case. Company cultures, which shape worker incentives and determine how a business reacts to changes in the marketplace, have become much more important in the digital age. Today, more than 80% of the value of Standard &amp; Poor\u2019s 500 firms is \u201cdark matter\u201d: the intangible secret sauce of success; the physical stuff companies own and their wage bill account for less than 20%, a reversal of the pattern that prevailed in the 1970s.</p> <p>A large proportion of that dark matter is an amorphous \u201cknow-how\u201d: the culture, incentives and tacit knowledge that make a modern company tick. Successful companies, be they Goldman Sachs or BuzzFeed, evolve a way of gathering, processing and acting on information that is critical to their success and which cannot easily be replicated. The value generated by a firm\u2019s culture, just like the value generated by networks of people within cities, or by a country\u2019s economic institutions, is social rather than individual.</p> <p>As social wealth becomes more important, fights about who belongs within particular societies \u2013 and can therefore share in that social wealth \u2013 will intensify. To take full advantage of its promise, countries must become better at sharing social wealth. Yet the better countries become at sharing social wealth among members, the greater the pressure to shrink the circle of social membership.</p> <p><strong>Separatist and nationalist political parties are on the rise across Europe</strong><br></p> <p>Today\u2019s political disturbances reflect the opening exchanges in a long societal negotiation over just what the state and the economy ought to do, and for whom, in the digital era. If the industrial era is any guide, this negotiation will last for decades to come and will occasionally result in dramatic, and possibly even violent, changes to the structure of global politics. Political systems are stubbornly resistant to change. Political parties are massive social institutions that persist for decades or centuries by building and maintaining connections with collections of smaller interest groups and individuals. Those people and interest groups come to define their political identity through their association with the party. Identities are not rewritten on a whim. Yet long-term changes in economic fundamentals do eventually force change.<br></p> <p>In America, where the political structure strongly favours a two-party system, the rise of fundamentalist factions has led to partisan polarisation. Intense, intra-party battling could eventually lead to irreconcilable differences, prompting a major party shake-up (or break-up). Such shifts are extremely rare in American politics, however. It is more probable that ascendant ideological camps within the Republican party, such as those with nativist passions, will come to dominate the party leadership, displacing the former establishment bosses. And the former establishment will then mostly accommodate itself to the new order, an easier trick, for most partisans, than flipping to the other side of the aisle entirely.</p> <p>Separatist and nationalist parties are on the rise across Europe. Le Pen\u2019s Front National is ascendant. Radical parties in Hungary and Poland are pushing for significant political change: to undermine existing democratic institutions and to edge away from the EU. In Britain, nationalist political elements, within the Ukip and the Conservative party, astonished the world by calling and winning a popular vote to remove Britain from the EU. Brexit will encourage Scottish nationalists, who may ultimately demand to leave the United Kingdom.</p> <p>Radical factions and parties battling for supremacy each have at their heart a particular conception of the \u201cgood life\u201d. Writers and thinkers, like me, try to imagine post-work utopias, in which, for example, sensibly structured social safety nets could free people of the constraints of the typical job. These people could then offer their services by the hour or the job on newfangled market-making apps, among other things, or they could even abandon labour markets altogether, as new forms of social institution encouraged them to volunteer their time to the community or otherwise engage in pro-social behaviour \u2013 while also living alongside people from vastly different backgrounds and perhaps nationalities, if some of us get our way.</p> <p>But that is possibly not what the typical rich-world citizen would consider the \u201cgood life\u201d, however much we might want that to be the case. We should instead anticipate that voters in many countries, rich and poor alike, will want something more predictable than life governed by supply-and-demand matching apps; more structured than life on the perpetual dole; more comfortable and familiar than life surrounded by people who do things in different ways, speak different languages and worship different deities.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ae141403c84fba58dfee476c3c5884a80c114fc8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ae141403c84fba58dfee476c3c5884a80c114fc8/0_221_4074_2445/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Violent opposition to migrants in countries across Europe, including Poland, are forcing political change.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Violent opposition to migrants in countries across Europe, including Poland, are forcing political change.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Marcin Obara/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In any future in which technology frees workers of the need to spend most of their daytime hours on the job, many people will opt for much more down time, often spent in rather aimless fashion. Yet people of all backgrounds also seem to value narratives of personal ambition and responsibility. People wish to have control over their economic lives and to be seen as contributing both to society and to the wellbeing of their families. People desire agency. They do not wish to be forced into unpleasant work by the need to feed their families, but neither do they want to be written off \u2013 or assigned meaningless work as the price of a generous welfare cheque. It isn\u2019t clear that the digital economy can provide the working conditions needed to extend the possibility of bourgeois comfort and status to a broader class of people. That will not stop them desiring it.</p> <p>The conflict between what people want and what economic and political systems are able to provide will play out in the political arena. Political battles will increasingly feature narratives about how to restore us all to a world in which people work at purposeful jobs for good pay. Those narratives will be thick with bogeymen: the malevolent forces denying voters access to that \u201cgood life\u201d. Conniving foreign governments, job-stealing immigrants, greedy bankers and incompetent politicians all star in such roles. Demagoguery can be a compelling political force.</p> <p><strong>Generous welfare policy will struggle to emerge in ethnically diverse regions</strong><br></p> <p>Reformers can compete in this arena. There will be room for leaders willing to say that the \u201cgood life\u201d of misty memory cannot be brought back; who promise instead to push forward modest, incrementalist policies, such as more generous state benefits and increased investment in training and infrastructure.<br></p> <p>The difficulty the reformers will face is that the global economy will tend to punish such effort. Labour abundance and structural demand weakness are not the sorts of things national politicians working in isolation can fix. They can ameliorate the worst effects, but that will leave voters disappointed. Moderate reformers will find themselves losing ground to politicians keen to unpick elements of the era of moderation, from the move towards freer trade and capital flows to the elimination of labour-market protections.</p> <p>Could there be a constituency for a more radical set of policy innovations: for generous, universal basic incomes, for example? Political interest in these sorts of reforms is growing. Yet generous welfare policy might struggle to emerge outside of places where political units are more ethnically or nationally coherent: where an absence of tribal suspicion facilitates the sharing of social wealth. It is no wonder that experimental, generous welfare policy has tended to emerge in Nordic countries, where ethnic and communal ties are strong (but where openness to immigration has begun to tear at the social consensus).</p> <p>Indeed, the creation of such communally coherent groups in an effort to protect social safety nets often seems to be the point of the new nationalist politics. What separatist quasi-nations seem to want is a world in which they enjoy the economic benefits of global integration, but in which critical political and economic decisions are made by societies with a high degree of national or ethnic coherence: a future of Irelands and Estonias rather than of Britains and Spains: larger states with more diverse populations. The institutions of the EU or, indeed, the world economy as a whole are not built to handle waves of fracturing nations.</p> <p>Italian, Belgian and even German leaders are understandably reluctant to sign off on Catalan independence, given the damage regional separatism could do to their own states. Rich-world ethno-nationalism could destroy the economic integration on which its prosperity depends. Even if it doesn\u2019t fail before it begins, the model of highly redistributive, ethno-nationalist mini-states will depend for its success on the exclusion of outsiders, condemning much of the world\u2019s population to poverty.</p> <p>Some time in the future, a wonderful new politics might well emerge that provides a robust minimum standard of living to all regardless of race or nationality, which supports a multitude of different conceptions of the \u201cgood life\u201d and which does not rely on some underlying fear of some outside other to maintain its popularity. We are not yet able to conceive of such a system or to understand what balance of political forces needs to emerge to bring it into existence and sustain it. And so, for the time being, we are stuck in a world of nasty political trade-offs. We can but hope this era will prove a fleeting one. History suggests it will not be. But perhaps we will get lucky.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.penguin.co.uk/books/284165/the-wealth-of-humans/\">The Wealth of Humans</a> <em>by </em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/ryanavent\"><em>Ryan Avent</em></a><em> is published by Allen Lane, \u00a325</em><br></p>",
  "<p>Seeking sustenance in a Brummie cafe to get me through the Tory conference, I heard myself request \u201ca full English Brexit\u201d. That\u2019s what it does to your head: several days of close confinement with Conservatives salivating over departure from the European Union.</p> <p>Back in the conference hall, the full English Brexit was being served up by Theresa May and all the mini-Mays in the cabinet as they sought to satisfy the audience\u2019s appetite for the starkest form of rupture with our partners of the past four decades. There are several possible ways of exiting the EU. They range from amicable separation to bitter divorce. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/toryconference\" title=\"\">Tory gathering in Birmingham</a> set Britain on a course that leads to the most turbulent, disruptive and hazardous form of departure. It was the working assumption of all the cabinet ministers I spoke to, and this was so regardless of which side they took during the referendum, that it is now near inevitable that Britain will cease to be a member of the single market. Among those Tories who have always yearned for that outcome, I found them talking as if it was a given. Even more significantly, ministers who would once have recoiled in horror from that prospect now sound resigned to it.</p> <p>This is hugely significant and how we got to this point needs some explanation. In June, it was not a given that Britain would do Brexit the hard way. Out had won, but only narrowly. There was much room for interpretation of what that meant. There was quite a lot of talk from leading Outers about needing to respect the 48% who voted the other way. Once the forces of Remain had recovered from the shock of their defeat, they initially remustered around the cause of preserving British membership of the single market and with it the trade and investment on which so many livelihoods depend. They could cite the Tory party\u2019s election manifesto. This had clearly suggested that, even if Britain voted to leave the EU, a Conservative government would sustain membership of the single market. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/apr/14/conservatives-election-manifesto-2015-the-key-points\" title=\"\">The manifesto promised</a>: \u201cWe are clear about what we want from Europe. We say: yes to the Single Market\u201d. That, Remainers declared, was the trench where they would dig in.</p> <p>That trench is still there, but I found very few people left defending it in Birmingham. The Tories are plunging towards hard Brexit and a riven Labour party is not in a fit condition to stop them. After an initial period of complacency, investors are waking up to the prospect that Britain could lurch out of the EU without reliable access to her most important markets. The more loudly her activists cheered Mrs May, the faster came the plunge in the pound. By the end of the week, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/oct/07/flash-crash-in-pound-spooks-investors-business-live\" title=\"\">sterling had dropped so vertiginously </a>that one pound didn\u2019t buy one euro at bureaux de change. As it has become clearer that Britain\u2019s government is tilting towards the Full Monty Brexit, so <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/08/eu-leaders-line-up-to-insist-uk-will-pay-a-high-price-for-brexit-stance\" title=\"\">European leaders have hardened their language</a> about the penalty that will entail.</p> <p>Why has this happened? A large part of the explanation is Mrs May and how she is choosing to resolve the paradox of being a prime minister tasked by the voters to deliver an outcome that she campaigned against. Many of the hardline Tory Brexiters were highly wary when she first moved into Number 10 because she had been a Remainer, albeit a near-invisible one, during the referendum campaign. Now the Brexiters speak of Mrs May in glowing terms. \u201cIt turns out that having a Remainer as prime minister has worked perfectly for us,\u201d one remarked to me. \u201cShe has to keep proving to us and the party that she is serious.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Remainers in the cabinet often sounded like they were the psychological captives of the Brexiters</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>She threw them three big lumps of meat. One of those announcements was really spin disguised as meat. Her \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/02/theresa-may-great-repeal-bill-eu-british-law\" title=\"\">Great Repeal Act</a>\u201d will in reality transfer EU law into British law, to then be removed or amended at a later date. Her more substantial announcement was that she would trigger article 50, the formal notification to the EU that Britain wants a divorce, no later than March next year. This creates an unforgiving timetable for what will be a horrendously complex and fraught negotiation.</p> <p>Even some of the Brexiters in the cabinet are starting to sober up to the reality of it. To describe the inundation of papers on the subject that he is consuming, one minister adopted an Americanism and told me it was \u201clike drinking from a fire hydrant\u201d.</p> <p>That negotiation will not be made easier by the prime minister\u2019s third, and most significant, act. That was to set a firm face against trying to find any accommodation with EU countries over freedom of movement. \u201cWe are not leaving the European Union only to give up control of immigration again,\u201d she declared. One of her cabinet confirmed to me that they plan to approach the negotiations by telling the EU that freedom of movement is simply not on the table; they only want to talk about trade. If you believe that the Out vote was powered by opposition to migration, then the only form of Brexit that respects the referendum result is a mode of departure that ends freedom of movement. This position has a logic to it and some of the recanting Tory Remainers contend that this logic is too powerful for them to argue with it. Resistance, they say, is futile. It is impossible to reconcile rejecting freedom of movement and the jurisdiction of the European court of justice with continued membership of the single market. So Britain will be left to gamble on trying to get some sort of tariff deal with EU countries at a time when they are in no mood to do us any favours.</p> <p>Stockholm Syndrome describes how some hostages become traumatically bonded with their kidnappers. Remainers in the cabinet often sounded like they were the psychological captives of the Brexiters. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/amber-rudd\" title=\"\">Amber Rudd</a>, a liberal Tory who was a star of the Remain campaign, was one of the ministers who made a hostage-video sort of speech to the conference. The home secretary announced that companies would be forced to declare how many foreigners they employed, as if attracting skilled people from abroad was a mark of shame. In her setpiece at the end of the conference, Mrs May denounced \u201ccitizens of nowhere\u201d. That was a clever applause line with unclever implications for a country that thrives by attracting overseas talent and investment. It is this that will be noted by the rest of the world, not fatuous rhetoric about Britain \u201cgoing global\u201d. The conference resounded to the slam of doors being shut.</p> <p>There were a few voices of resistance. One was the effervescently gobby former minister <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/30/anna-soubry-brands-liam-foxs-free-trade-speech-delusional\" title=\"\">Anna Soubry.</a> Another was the former cabinet minister <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/nicky-morgan\" title=\"\">Nicky Morgan</a>. They stood out so much because those prepared to argue openly for a softer Brexit were so thin on the ground in Birmingham. Tory resistance to hard Brexit has been badly weakened by what has been happening in the Labour party since the referendum. In its immediate aftermath, Labour MPs declared that they would battle to preserve membership of the single market. Then they examined the vote in their party\u2019s traditional heartlands in Wales, the north of England and the Midlands and grew terrified by the strength of the Out vote there.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/labourconference\" title=\"\">Labour conference in Liverpool </a>was notable for the number of prominent MPs from its centrist wing declaring they could no longer defend unrestricted freedom of movement. Jeremy Corbyn has another position again. He is hostile to the single market but in favour of unlimited migration. The net result is that the Tory soft Brexiters do not think that they can rely on support from the main opposition party.</p> <p>Business and the City are becoming increasingly agitated that Brexit will not be the soft landing they hoped for. Representatives of manufacturers at the conference spoke of becoming more depressed by the day. But the mood of the times is not sympathetic to business arguments. It was striking to witness a Tory conference eagerly applaud a Tory prime minister lacerating corporate Britain. Some Tories say publicly, and more will say privately, they are willing to sacrifice some prosperity if that is the price of curbing immigration. This made it especially ironic that the Tories met in Birmingham, a melting-pot city whose prosperity was built on entrepreneurship and trade. Never has the Conservative party sounded less like a friend of business. Never has the Conservative party sounded more hostile to liberal free markets. Were the Labour party under a different form of management, the Tories might be more nervous of alienating business by taking the hard route to Brexit. But not in a century of Sundays are the CBI and the City going to ally themselves with Mr Corbyn.</p> <p>Free-market liberals still have some champions in government, notably at the Treasury, which thinks the economic impact of a hard Brexit will be severe and long lasting. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/philip-hammond\" title=\"\">Philip Hammond</a>, the chancellor, told the conference that the referendum result was not a vote to make Britain poorer. That he would not have said unless he feared his colleagues are pushing in a direction that will leave Britain very much the poorer. The chancellor sounded like a man losing the battle.
