I know that\u2019s a term they reserve for Barack Obama, but I think women can have swag also. I take a lot of pride in the way I dress, the way I look, the way I carry myself.\u201d</p> \n<p>Baxter, who spent 31 years with the New York City board of education, was quickly taken out of her comfort zone: as a teenager in the early 1960s, she was a scholarship student at a highly selective Bronx-based private school named Fieldston. \u201cI was the only black female in my class.\u201d</p> \n<p>Baxter, who came from a mixed family \u2013 with a white father and a part African American, part Native American mother \u2013 found it scary at first. Discrimination was evident. There were parties she wasn\u2019t invited to, comments she was subjected to.</p> \n<p>Discrimination followed her. After college, despite qualifying as a high school teacher, when it came to a final oral examination, she was failed. The board of examiners said her southern accent was an impediment to her being understood by students in the classroom. But Baxter didn\u2019t have one; she had lived in New York her entire life.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom element--supporting\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"6c1d7665-bec5-4d84-8487-7c3f97a7cd62\" data-atom-type=\"explainer\"> \n  <div>\n   <figure class=\"element element-explainer element-atom\" data-display-type=\"expandable\"> \n    <h1>The Guardian view on America\u2019s choice</h1> \n    <div>\n     <p>If we had a vote, we would use it to elect Hillary Clinton as president. She's a thoughtful politician who has&nbsp;responded to concerns about her cautious centrism by committing to more radical plans. With decades of experience, she is a fitting successor to Barack Obama. It is also high time there was a woman president. By contrast Donald Trump is an irascible egomaniac, uninterested in the world. He has fought a campaign of abuse, riddled with racism and misogyny. He propagates lies, ignorance and prejudice.</p>\n     <p>There are three particular ways in which electing Mr Trump is a step that should be spurned by any responsible American voter.

Mrs Clinton is much better. So elect her.</p>\n    </div> \n   </figure> \n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Baxter eventually qualified and rose up. Her crowning achievement? Besides her two daughters, she says that as a principal, she turned around a failing school in the Bronx in record time. In just three years, Baxter overhauled a 5,000-student school where many attendants lived below the poverty line \u2013 significantly improving grades, attendance and morale. The accomplishment won her an <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/1996/01/27/opinion/cloning-thelma-baxter.html\">editorial</a> in the New York Times, the title of which reads \u201cCloning Thelma Baxter\u201d.</p> \n<p>More broadly, it is birth control, Roe v Wade, and winning the battle of being in charge of our own bodies that she considers the most important victory she has seen in her lifetime.</p> \n<p>Other victories, like childcare, and finding ways to balance careers with child-rearing, have yet to come. Baxter remembers her mother, a prominent journalist and then city government worker, suffering from that struggle. It is the same struggle she grappled with, that she now sees her daughters also face.</p> \n<p>Baxter says Hillary Clinton has faced a vast amount of unfair scrutiny in the run-up to the presidential elections. Her own way of vanquishing such treatment was to keep on facing the challenges set before her. \u201cI just had to overcome those kinds of hurdles. I had to constantly prove to people that I was qualified, well-prepared and that I wanted to do the job \u2013 and that I was up to doing the job. I think that\u2019s a hurdle that all minority, black, or Hispanic women have to face, much more so than white women.\u201d</p> \n<p>And going to cast a vote for the first female president feels important as well as historic. \u201cI will be very, very proud. Almost as proud as when I went to vote for Barack.\u201d</p> \n<h2>Gloria Neuwirth, 82, lawyer: \u2018It\u2019s an uphill battle for women\u2019</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/nov/08/hillary-clinton-women-voter-gloria-neuwirth-video\" data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/5b3n4\" data-show-ads=\"true\" data-video-id=\"2876530\" data-video-name=\"Gloria Neuwirth, age 82, on voting for a female president \u2013 video\" data-video-provider=\"guardian.co.uk\"> \n <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-5822332ce4b0822c310ec179\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> \n  <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/11/08/161108gloriafinalwoman_desk.mp4\">\n  <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/11/08/161108gloriafinalwoman.m3u8\">\n  <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/11/08/161108gloriafinalwoman_WebM.webm\"> \n </video> \n <figcaption>\n  <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/nov/08/hillary-clinton-women-voter-gloria-neuwirth-video\">Gloria Neuwirth, age 82, on voting for a female president</a>\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Sitting behind her large wooden desk, Gloria Neuwirth says she is cutting down her work hours at the Manhattan law firm where she has been a partner for the last 20 years. \u201cI am cutting down from five days to four days a week,\u201d she states, no movement of the eyelid detectable.</p> \n<p>Neuwirth grew up in the South Bronx, the daughter of immigrant parents who owned a chain of pharmacies. She\u2019s the product of the New York City public school system, and recalls riding the subway to go to piano lessons with a degree of freedom and independence.</p> \n<p>In the mid-1950s, Neuwirth attended Yale law school: she was one of just 12 women in a class of 162 students. Her gender received frequent attention. \u201cThe question that I got from students and even some professors was: why are you here, taking the place of a man? I heard that question over and over again, the assumption being I was going to graduate and just go and raise a family.\u201d</p> \n<p>After graduating, finding a job was hard. \u201cThere weren\u2019t many jobs available to women. It was the late 1950s.\u201d</p> \n<p>One company refused to hire her because they held occasional evening meetings they didn\u2019t think would be suitable for her to attend. Another Wall Street firm declared they didn\u2019t hire women, but told her she was pretty, so they\u2019d be happy to talk to her.</p> \n<p>Neuwirth eventually found a job as a researcher with Columbia University and the Bar Association. A little over a decade later, after taking time off to have four children, she once more struggled to find employment. She wanted work adapted to her family requirements \u2013 an almost impossible ask. The battle for flexibility and childcare is a gender battle that has yet to be won, she says.</p> \n<p>Women have come a long way since she first qualified as a lawyer, Neuwirth points out. Nowadays, women make up a little over half of law school students. But then, she pauses, she also read of a law firm that had announced new partners, 14 out of 15 of whom were men. \u201cSo I would say it\u2019s an uphill battle for women.\u201d</p> \n<p>As for having a woman in the White House, it will be \u201cvery exciting for girls as well as boys to see that a woman can be president\u201d. However, America is hardly blazing a trail, she points out. \u201cWe are way behind the rest of the world. So many other countries have had women leaders, and we have never.\u201d</p> \n<h2><strong>Robin Morgan</strong>, 75: \u2018People have died for the right to vote \u2013 women included\u2019</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/nov/08/robin-morgan-hillary-clinton-video\" data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/5b3f4\" data-show-ads=\"true\" data-video-id=\"2876314\" data-video-name=\"Robin Morgan, age 75, on voting for a female president \u2013 video\" data-video-provider=\"The Guardian\"> \n <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-58220a57e4b0eda0192fd80c\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> \n  <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/11/08/161108robinfinalwoman_desk.mp4\">\n  <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/11/08/161108robinfinalwoman.m3u8\">\n  <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/11/08/161108robinfinalwoman_WebM.webm\"> \n </video> \n <figcaption>\n  <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/nov/08/robin-morgan-hillary-clinton-video\">Robin Morgan, age 75, on voting for a female president</a>\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Robin Morgan sits by the fire in her small, book-filled New York City apartment, and lets her gaze be drawn towards the small entrance to her bathroom, where a few framed letters have been placed.</p> \n<p>The writer, feminist, activist organizer and radio <a href=\"http://www.wmclive.com/\">show</a> host nods. \u201cYes, those are copies of some of my correspondence with Simone de Beauvoir,\u201d she confirms. \u201cShe was a wonderful woman.\u201d</p> \n<p>Morgan, a child actor who enrolled as a non-matriculated student at Columbia University aged 14, says her first adult job as a secretary at a New York literary agency in the late 1950s forced her to confront serious sexism.</p> \n<p>Around the same time, like \u201ca great many other idealistic young people\u201d, she became involved in the civil rights and then anti-Vietnam movements. It was a rude awakening.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe are doing all this work in civil rights and anti-war movements thinking that we are marching towards this brave new world with our revolutionary brothers where we would all be equal and free. And, not so much. Because we discovered that our revolutionary brothers thought women were a species apart.\u201d</p> \n<p>Morgan recalls men in both movements issuing derogatory come-ons to women. \u201cHey baby, give me a little of my civil rights tonight\u201d and \u201cGirls say yes to boys who say no\u201d were lines that were all too common, she says. \u201cIf you think about it, of course, that statement pimps women.\u201d</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>We discovered that our revolutionary brothers thought women were a species apart</p> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>In 1968, Morgan <a href=\"http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/missamerica/peopleevents/e_feminists.html\">helped lead a protest</a> at the Miss America pageant, decrying the degrading nature of the event. The protest, which attracted national and international coverage, threw the American women\u2019s liberation movement firmly into the mainstream.</p> \n<p>But for her, looking back, it is not the more than 20 published books that are her greatest professional accomplishment, but rather her participation in the establishment of a global women\u2019s rights movement. \u201cWomen are aware now that they are part of a global movement. The United States did not invent feminism; it is not an export from the Americas. We are one mosaic tile in a grand mosaic.\u201d</p> \n<p>She mentions how slow some battles feel \u2013 against sexual harassment, for instance. \u201cEvery now and then you think: how can this still be happening?\u201d</p> \n<p>\u201cEvery woman in this country, I think every woman on this planet knows, has experienced some version of sexual harassment \u2013 some man has put his hands or looks where they shouldn\u2019t have been, employment discrimination, whether it\u2019s a job you have or a career.\u201d</p> \n<p>But she remains optimistic. \u201cIf you pan back to a historical perspective, change is happening very rapidly.\u201d</p> \n<p>And although Morgan believes electing a female president should not be perceived as the be-all and end-all \u2013 \u201cWe still have racism having had a black president for two terms, and we even have backlash\u201d \u2013 it still feels like an exciting moment.</p> \n<p>\u201cI will vote with great pride, I will be moved to do so. Just to see a woman\u2019s name on the ballot. And not any woman, but to see a woman who in a very real way comes out of the women\u2019s movement, who was affected by the women\u2019s movement, calls herself a feminist, stands for many of the things that we have put on the map. That\u2019s a thrill I didn\u2019t think I\u2019d get to see.\u201d</p>",

They run a hotline - 866-OUR-VOTE \u2013 which has received thousands of complaints from voters running into difficulties.</p> <p>North Carolina, one of the most sensitive swing states that both Clinton and Trump have poured resources into winning, has been particularly troubled today by voting machines breaking down and electronic polling books seizing up. There\u2019s no suggestion of foul play here, but it has complicated an already tense election day.</p> <p>Texas is a story of more willful trouble. The Republican-controlled legislatures efforts to introduce one of the strictest forms of photo-ID requirements in the country has led to widespread confusion, Perez said.</p> <p>The coalition has found numerous cases of signs being posted on the walls of polling stations that incorrectly inform voters about Texas\u2019 photo-ID criteria.</p> <p>Many complaints have come in about alleged intimidation of voters outside polling stations from a number of states. \u201cWe\u2019ve certainly heard from voters complaining about this, though it\u2019s going to be very hard to tell how organized it was. It\u2019s too early to tell whether it was an individual action or something more planned.\u201d</p> <p>One development that Perez said would have to be reviewed after the dust has settled from this election was the proliferation of poll watchers. The 2016 election cycle, given the degree of suspicion around, had spawned the surreal phenomenon of poll watchers observing voters and then poll monitors watching them.</p> <p>\u201cWe are creating a culture of multiple layers of people observing each other, which produces it\u2019s own challenges. We\u2019ve got to a place where poll watchers watch watchers watching watchers.\u201d</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-58224cdfe4b0eda0192fd924\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-11-08T22:08:59.122Z\">10.08pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Spokesperson: George W.

But whether Clinton wins or not, \u201cshe\u2019s opened the door for future women to think about running and that\u2019s important. I\u2019m sure there will be others, maybe not in my lifetime.

I was pleasantly surprised to only wait about 15 minutes in line, and I am so grateful for the friendly attitudes and efficiency of the volunteers. The voting process went smoothly, and regardless of how long anyone has to wait in line, I encourage you to vote. Quite frankly, there is too much at stake in this election. My girlfriend and I are going to order takeout and watch the election results tonight... Regardless of which candidate wins Missouri this year, I\u2019m proud to say I cast my ballot to promote a better political future for myself as a young adult, and a better future for all Americans.</p> <p><strong>Steve Pearcy from Manassas, Virginia says his mom would have liked to have seen today:</strong></p> <p>When my mom and dad were born, a woman couldn\u2019t vote in the US. A black man theoretically could vote, but his right to do so was usually denied, usually, alas, by Democrats in the south. Folks from poor backgrounds like my folks didn\u2019t really have much chance of going to college to change their lot in life. If someone without money got seriously ill, they usually died, like my grand-uncle\u2019s young wife and their two-year old child in the flu epidemic of 1918.</p> <p>A little over 40 years later when I was born, a woman could vote in the US. Barriers to black folk voting would be torn down a few years later with the Civil Rights and Voting Rights Acts, laws pushed through by more visionary Democrats. A few years later Medicare and Medicaid programs were enacted by Democrats so people without means had access to health care. A woman and man of different races could not marry in many states of the US. My father, who grew up on a tenant farm in Missouri, went to college after World War II with the GI Bill. My brother would go to college a few years after I was born, my mother would get her degree 14 years after I was born, and from an early age I just assumed I\u2019d go to college. As a kid, my grandmother used to say with pride, \u201cI\u2019m a Baptist and a Democrat,\u201d and my parents took me to vote and see them vote for Democrats because the Democratic party tried to help all people, not just the rich.</p> <p>A little over 40 years after I was born, I sat with my parents and cheered and cried as we watched as Barack Obama, the son of a white woman and a black man, was nominated to be the Democratic candidate for president. Unfortunately there were and still are folk who try to keep people of color from voting, but such efforts have the boom-a-rang effect of making people more determined to vote. More and more people in the United States are getting the chance to go to college. The Affordable Care Act enacted by Democrats provides access to health care to millions who did not have access before. People of all races can marry anyone who they wish. The country continues to try to be better with every generation, to try to be a more perfect union.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-11-08T21:25:46.074Z\">at 9.25pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-58222cd2e4b0eda0192fd8a9\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/sam-thielman\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-11-08T19:52:43.099Z\">7.52pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Trump cited voting machine malfunctions on CNN on Tuesday afternoon when he again refused to say whether he would concede the election if he lost.

In Jacksonville, an unauthorized person was reported to be inside a polling place and refusing to leave in a way that voters found menacing. The coalition declined to state the individual\u2019s party affiliation. </p> <p>There are also reports of intimidating behavior by a group of individuals behaving aggressively outside the polling place at the Hollywood branch library in Broward County. The group approached vehicles in a way that made some would-be voters turn round and drive away before they had a chance to vote.</p> <p>The National Coalition for Black Civic Participation said that people have been spotted in Florida driving around in pickup trucks waving Confederate flags in a threatening posture.</p> <p>By 9.30am, the hotline had received 5,500 calls from around the nation. Many were from North Carolina, another hotly fought state, where polling machines were malfunctioning across entire counties.</p> <p>The election protection coalition has 4,500 legal volunteers at hand today to deal with the calls coming in to its 23 call centers around the country.

It\u2019s election day, but we\u2019ll resist the temptation to wax dramatic. No reflections on the historical import of a day that could see the election of the first woman US president, or of Donald Trump. No musing about just how long these last 18 months have sometimes felt. No solicitations after your personal health, mental and physical, at this, the (apparent) end of our collective slog through a muddy field of base discourse, objectionable behavior and trampled bunting.</p> <p>There were some happy moments in there! We think. And we will recall them just as soon as the votes are counted. Which brings us to the main business of the day: bringing you the election results, as soon as they come in, from Maine to Alaska. That\u2019s the purpose of today\u2019s blog, and that\u2019s what you can expect as the polls begin to close, initial returns come back, state results are declared and the identity of the 45th president of the United States is revealed.</p> <p>When will we know who was elected president? In 2000, they didn\u2019t know until December. But that was exceptional. With any luck tonight, we\u2019ll know the identity of the next president before the clock ticks into Wednesday on the east coast. The first polls opened in New Hampshire at midnight - with three tiny towns allowing midnight voting and immediate results. </p> <p>Out of the 64 ballots cast in those three counties, Trump nabbed 32 votes, Clinton got 25 and three went to Libertarian Gary Johnson.</p> <p>The last polls, in the Aleutian Islands of Alaska, aren\u2019t due to close until 1am ET.

The corporation said it would be ready to start crossing the water in two weeks.</p> <p>The announcement came on a quiet election day at the encampments built by members of the Standing Rock Sioux nation and other indigenous people in opposition to the pipeline.</p> <p>After a string of clashes and mass arrests, rumors spread among activists that the pipeline, government and tribal leaders had negotiated a <a href=\"http://www.motherjones.com/environment/2016/11/dakota-access-pipeline-standing-rock-delay\">30-day moratorium</a> on both construction and protest or religious ceremonies on the \u201cfront lines\u201d of the conflict.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m in shock. I\u2019m speechless,\u201d said Cheryl Angel, a Sicangu Lakota tribe member who has been at the Standing Rock camps since the spring. \u201cIt\u2019s unconscionable and devastating. It\u2019s almost as though they have no soul.\u201d</p> <p>The announcement presents the final phase of construction as a done deal, and will be seen as a clear illustration that the oil company is aggressively moving forward with the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/nov/03/north-dakota-access-oil-pipeline-protests-explainer\">$3.7bn pipeline</a> in defiance of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/nov/02/dakota-access-obama-suggests-ways-to-reroute-pipeline-being-investigated\">Barack Obama</a> and the thousands of demonstrators who are camped out at Standing Rock to fight the project.</p> <p>Last week, Obama made his first remarks on the huge demonstrations since police <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/27/north-dakota-access-pipeline-protest-arrests-pepper-spray\">arrested hundreds of unarmed protesters</a>, who call themselves \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/18/north-dakota-pipeline-activists-bakken-oil-fields\">water protectors</a>\u201d and say the pipeline is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/29/north-dakota-oil-pipeline-protest-standing-rock-sioux\">destroying sacred indigenous lands</a>.</p> <p>The president said the US army corps of engineers was exploring ways to \u201creroute\u201d around Native American lands, and said the government was \u201cgoing to let it play out for several more weeks, and determine whether or not this can be resolved in a way that I think is properly attentive to the traditions of the first Americans\u201d.</p> <p>In September, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/12/north-dakota-standing-rock-protests-civil-rights\">government said</a> it would temporarily <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/joint-statement-department-justice-department-army-and-department-interior-regarding-standing\">halt permits</a> to dig on federal land near or under the Missouri river and requested that the company \u201cvoluntarily pause all construction activity within 20 miles east or west\u201d of Lake Oahe.</p> <p>Energy Transfer Partners ignored that request and continued construction, recently <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/31/north-dakota-access-pipeline-protest-last-stand\">approaching within a few miles of the river</a>, causing widespread anger and sadness at the Standing Rock camps, which have been opposing the pipeline since April.</p> <p>Tuesday\u2019s statement does not address the requests from the government for a delay. On the contrary, it suggests that the company is not giving consideration to alternative routes or Obama\u2019s recent remarks.</p> <p>\u201cDakota Access previously received a permit from the army corps with respect the tunneling activities under Lake Oahe, and Dakota Access has all other regulatory approvals and land rights to complete the crossing of the Missouri river at Lake Oahe,\u201d the statement said, adding that the company expects to receive final permissions \u201cin a time frame that will not result in any significant delay\u201d.</p> <p>The army corps did not respond to requests for comment.</p> <p>Asked about Obama\u2019s comments, pipeline spokeswoman Vicki Granado told the Guardian: \u201cWe are not aware that any consideration is being given to a reroute, and we remain confident we will receive our easement in a timely fashion.\u201d</p> <p>The company\u2019s announcement comes as North Dakota regulators are moving ahead with a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/nov/05/dakota-access-oil-pipeline-native-american-artifacts-discovered\">formal complaint against the corporation</a> for failing to properly disclose findings of Native American artifacts along the construction route.</p> <p>Angel said the pipeline construction plan was \u201cenvironmentally irresponsible\u201d and \u201cillegal\u201d considering the army corps has yet to approve final permits. Noting that the Missouri river provided drinking water to millions, she added: \u201cI\u2019m in tears, because I can\u2019t believe [the company] would do this to a whole group of people who don\u2019t have any say.\u201d</p> <p>This past Sunday, more than a hundred water protectors used boats to ferry across the Cannonball river and attempted to climb \u201cTurtle Island\u201d \u2013 a portion of army corps land where tribal members say there are 11 burial sites. Several tribal elders, including Darrel Killsinsight, implored everyone to return to the main camp, referencing the alleged 30-day agreement.</p> <p>But representatives of the tribe never officially confirmed that any such agreement was in place, and Tuesday\u2019s statement flies in the face of any hope for a moratorium. </p> <p>Jan Hasselman, the attorney representing the Standing Rock Sioux in its permit litigation, said that the statement from Dakota Access was probably a <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-north-dakota-pipeline-energy-transfer-idUSKBN1332QZ?feedType=RSS&amp;feedName=domesticNews&amp;utm_medium=Social&amp;utm_source=Twitter\">response to an army corps spokesman</a> telling Bloomberg that the company had agreed to slow construction. But, she added, Dakota Access does not have all the permits it needs to begin drilling, including the easement. </p> <p>\u201cStarting construction without permits would be beyond the pale, even for Dakota Access,\u201d Hasselman told the Guardian. \u201cIt is deeply irresponsible to keep putting investors\u2019 money into this route when both the President and Senator Tim Kaine are openly discussing rerouting away from Lake Oahe.\u201d</p> <p>The timing of the announcement on election day instantly raised suspicion \u2013 and anger \u2013 among the activists gathered at Standing Rock. Activists have expressed frustration with the US presidential race, noting that Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2016/oct/27/north-dakota-access-pipeline-police-protesters-live-updates?page=with:block-58129388e4b08d944ba4b6f5#block-58129388e4b08d944ba4b6f5\">refused</a> to take a position on the conflict and GOP candidate <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/26/donald-trump-dakota-access-pipeline-investment-energy-transfer-partners\">Donald Trump has close financial ties to the pipeline</a>.</p> <p>\u201cWith the election being so big, and North Dakota being so small, they think they can just sweep this under the rug,\u201d said Danny Grassrope, a member of the Lower Brule Sioux Tribe. \u201cI\u2019m not really surprised. Snakes are sneaky, and this is a black snake. It blindsides everyone.\u201d</p> <p>He added: \u201cA lot of people are going to get angry, and this is where we need to stay positive. We need prayers more than ever now.\u201d</p> <p>The protesters were also disappointed that Obama has not condemned the highly militarized police force in North Dakota, which has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/nov/04/dakota-access-pipeline-protest-standing-rock-women-police-abuse\">arrested more than 400 people</a> and deployed Mace, Tasers, rubber bullets and army tanks to respond to demonstrations.</p> <p>A UN group is also investigating claims of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/29/dakota-access-pipeline-native-american-protesters\">inhumane jail treatment</a> and other human rights abuses by law enforcement.</p> <p>\u201cAre indigenous people so invaluable that now that Dakota Access is to the water, does it not matter to anyone that people are going to start laying down their lives?\u201d asked Eryn Wise, a member of the Jicarilla Apache and Laguna Pueblo tribes.</p> <p>\u201cI think that people need to seriously question the integrity of the work produced by DAPL right now, because they\u2019re rushing,\u201d Wise added. \u201cIs it safe when they\u2019ve been rushing like this?\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 The headline on this article was amended on 11 November 2016 to better reflect the article.</p>",
  "<p>How to describe this <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/jul/25/bowie-musical-lazarus-to-open-in-london\">feted New York import</a> by David Bowie and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2014/sep/18/enda-walsh-playwright-screenwriter-theatre-animal-solitude-roles-void-physical-comedy\">Enda Walsh</a>? \u201cMusical\u201d seems inadequate. It is part sci-fi story, part rock concert, part video installation, part study in alienation. But, while the separate ingredients are fascinating to watch in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2016/nov/06/ivo-van-hove-i-give-it-all-like-bowie-gave-it-all-in-a-masked-way-lazarus-interview\">Ivo van Hove</a>\u2019s kaleidoscopic production, I rarely felt moved.</p> <p> The impulse behind the show came from Bowie himself who wanted to explore further the character of Thomas Newton, the extraterrestrial he played in the 1976 Nicolas Roeg movie <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/sep/08/the-man-who-fell-to-earth-review-nicolas-roeg-david-bowie\">The Man Who Fell to Earth</a>. Now, suffocatingly rich and living a life of alcoholic seclusion in New York, the hero might best be described as Thomas the tanked alien. He pines for a lost earthly love, Mary Lou, is covertly worshipped by his assistant, Elly, and is visited by an ethereal character known simply as Girl who offers him the prospect of building a rocket to return to his native planet.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"8330f39e5c0190c7598dc8f91d1ed3e14532043d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8330f39e5c0190c7598dc8f91d1ed3e14532043d/0_1037_3013_3765/800.jpg\" alt=\"Michael C Hall and Sophia Anne Caruso\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">An engrossing spectacle \u2026 Michael C Hall and Sophia Anne Caruso</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tristram Kenton for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p> Many New York critics, on the show\u2019s debut last December, professed to be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2015/dec/08/lazarus-review-david-bowie-jukebox-musical-off-broadway-new-york\">bewildered by the plot</a>. I took it to be an exploration of the existential angst that pervades Bowie\u2019s music: this is the story of a man never wholly at ease in himself or his surroundings. It was also shrewd of Bowie to engage Walsh to write the book because, in plays such as <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2014/jul/21/ballyturk-review-cillian-murphy-enda-walsh\">Ballyturk</a> and <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2008/sep/26/theatre2\">The Walworth Farce</a>, the Irish dramatist has shown a hypnotised fascination with characters who create fantasy worlds to allay their solitude. Walsh\u2019s script is also stuffed with literary clues. Thomas quotes Hamlet\u2019s \u201cIn that sleep of death what dreams may come\u201d, suggesting he identifies with the Danish prince torn between two worlds, and it is no accident that the ghostly Girl is called Marley, like Scrooge\u2019s revenant partner in A Christmas Carol.</p> <p> The ingredients are all there, but do they add up to a memorable show? Yes and no. The big draw is clearly the Bowie score. Of the 17 songs some are old, some new and, at best, they extend the dramatic situation. When Amy Lennox \u2013 the main newcomer to the cast and outstanding as Elly \u2013 sings the 1971 song Changes, it seems a logical expression of her urge to transform herself into the lost Mary-Lou.</p> <p> At other times, as when the whey-faced Sophia Anne Caruso as Girl sings Life on Mars?, I felt the number, which is surely about earthbound ennui, is less strictly relevant to the character. But Bowie buffs will be delighted to hear so many songs very well played by an onstage band situated behind a clear acrylic screen.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2016/nov/09/lazarus-musical-david-bowie-kings-cross-theatre\">Lazarus: \u2018A jukebox musical for people who are too hip for We Will Rock You\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <p> Van Hove, his long-term designer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/ng-interactive/2015/aug/18/designs-jan-versweyveld-antigone-view-from-the-bridge\">Jan Versweyveld</a> and the video designer Tal Yarden have created an engrossing spectacle. The deliberate plainness of the surround is offset by the profusion of images that pour from a central screen depicting everything from the neon sickness of urban America to the Berlin background of Where Are We Now? At one point a character even emerges from the screen to become a peripatetic hologram. I also admired <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2016/oct/21/david-bowie-lazarus-video-michael-c-hall\">Michael C Hall</a>, who conveys the desperation of the lonely, time-suspended Thomas and Michael Esper, who lends Valentine, a serial killer symbolising Earth\u2019s dark forces, a saturnine vigour.</p> <p> Yet, for all the show\u2019s skill, I found myself more impressed by the visual sophistication than emotionally engaged by the story: only when Lennox sang of her divided self and when Hall gazed wistfully at the lost delights of earthly love was I moved. Of course, it\u2019s great to hear the Bowie songs and his death lends the show a patina of melancholy. But, watching this spectacular study of a pained outsider\u2019s search for peace, I too felt a sense of alienation.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9e650c14a25d0430bfc6feb8c6eb06a150a54978\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9e650c14a25d0430bfc6feb8c6eb06a150a54978/0_721_4883_2930/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Amy Lennox as Elly, Michael C Hall as Newton and Sophia Anne Caruso as Girl in Lazarus.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A pained outsider\u2019s search for peace \u2026 Amy Lennox as Elly, Michael C Hall as Newton and Sophia Anne Caruso as Girl in Lazarus.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <ul> <li>At <a href=\"https://lazarusmusical.com/\">King\u2019s Cross theatre</a>, London, until 22 January.

On the Origin of Art \u2013 which opened at the weekend with a Gatsby-ish private party even more lavish than the museum\u2019s official launch \u2013 is the culmination of five years of planning and decades of fascination for Walsh and his team.

Taken as a jumbled collection of art to spend an afternoon in \u2013 featuring such names as Pierre-Auguste Renoir, Brett Whiteley, Cindy Sherman, Bill Henson, Fiona Hall \u2013 it is extravagant enough: in literary professor Brian Boyd\u2019s exhibition, for instance, you\u2019ll find a retrospective of Art Spiegelman\u2019s comics, a dazzling melting rug from Azerbaijan\u2019s Faig Ahmed, ancient patterned pottery from central America, and a bright yellow polka dotted mirror room by Yayoi Kusama, commissioned for this exhibition. </p> <p>But through their curation, and in the<strong> </strong>accompanying audio tours and essays, it becomes so much more. Each expert asks and answers a different question about art, science and evolution<strong> </strong>\u2013 some more successfully than others, and some in direct opposition to others \u2013 for an overall experience that\u2019s as fun to think about as it is to look at. </p> <p>Stephen Pinker, cognitive scientist, linguist and popular science author, makes perhaps the most compelling argument. He believes artistic drive has not evolved as a trait but arrived as a byproduct, piggy-backing on other adaptive aesthetics \u2013 our appreciation of \u201cgood\u201d bodies (for reproduction), high status (for security) and pretty landscapes (for safety). </p> <p>Brian Boyd<strong>, </strong>by contrast, homes in on patterns \u2013 in nature, in Shakespeare, in Indigenous art, in comics \u2013 which help humans make sense of, and play with, the information around them. </p> <p>The US evolutionary neurobiologist Mark Changizi brings us art that resembles the natural world \u2013 evocative but also grotesque \u201cuncanny valley\u201d sculptures by Patricia Piccinini, a commissioned installation by Brigita Ozolins exploring the resemblance of alphabet letters to the contours of nature \u2013 to show us that art is shaped to fit preferences our brains have already developed.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1ce167e6559137910abc2053a6f65468fca8fb49\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1ce167e6559137910abc2053a6f65468fca8fb49/0_0_6400_4267/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sphinx (2012) by Australian artist Patricia Piccinini, with more of her works in the background\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sphinx (2012) by the Australian artist Patricia Piccinini, with more of her works in the background.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: R\u00e9mi Chauvin/Mona</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The rooms Walsh and I are standing in, though, are the gallerist\u2019s favourite.

And that to me is the most respectful and psychological way to think about the origin or art.<br></p> <p>\u201cIf you say it\u2019s for survival, or it\u2019s just for play, or it\u2019s a side-effect of other [adaptive] abilities, then <em>that</em> is a reductive explanation,\u201d he continues, condensing the other three curations into refutable bites.</p> <p>He could have curated his exhibition without any sexual content, he says, but that would have missed the point. \u201cThe sexual content is partly just to remind the art critic people that they\u2019ve systematically excluded sexuality from the history of art for centuries \u2026 The point is that sexuality is central to human nature.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"db02124830996646fb60deef38e8517a4f644fe6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/db02124830996646fb60deef38e8517a4f644fe6/0_0_1530_2048/747.jpg\" alt=\"Untitled (2006) by Balint Zsako\" width=\"747\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018The point is that sexuality is central to human nature\u2019: Untitled (2006) by Balint Zsako, curated by Geoffrey Miller for On the Origin of Art at Mona.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Balint Zsako/Mona</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It\u2019s no surprise to find that Miller\u2019s understanding and curation of art is the one Walsh most subscribes to. This is, after all, a man so invested in the demystification of bodies and sex that he has in his art collection 150 vulvas, individually sculpted from live models, and a toilet that doubles as a viewing station to watch your own anus as you defecate. Walsh\u2019s aim has always been to \u201cdemocratise art\u201d, using science, philosophy and agitprop to disrupt the art world.</p> <p>It\u2019s a world Walsh is particularly scathing about: \u201cThe most honest statement of what the art community believes, particularly the academic art community, is, \u2018We\u2019ve never thought about it and God willing, <em>inshallah</em>, we never will. Don\u2019t make us think about things that actually require the acquisition of expertise. We want to spend five minutes getting our degree and then essentially do nothing, make a good income, and get laid for the rest of our lives because of it.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>For Walsh, this exhibition represents the next stage in his \u201cvoyage of discovery\u201d. \u201cI own an art gallery and I know almost nothing about art,\u201d he says. It was one of Walsh\u2019s main reasons for opening Mona in the first place: to start and learn from a conversation about what art is. </p> <p>The other motive behind opening Mona? Well, that should be obvious by now. </p> <p>\u201cLet me ask you, if there\u2019s someone who owns a gallery of this scale, compared with someone that doesn\u2019t, which do you think is more likely to get laid?\u201d</p> <p>I answer the question with a pointed finger.</p> <p>\u201cWell, see, <em>there\u2019s</em> the biological advantage,\u201d he says.<br></p> <p>\u2022 <em>Mona\u2019s new exhibition, <a href=\"https://mona.net.au/ooa/\">On the Origin of Art</a>, is open until 17 April.

John Higgins at consultancy Capital Economics said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>A victory for Hillary Clinton in the presidential race was heavily discounted on the day of the vote. So we doubt that there will be much of a response in the markets today if she has triumphed. But a win for Donald Trump could cause major upheaval.</p> <p>For example, a victory for Trump would probably send the dollar down sharply against other \u201cmajors\u201d, particularly the Swiss franc and the Japanese yen. We would expect the yen/dollar exchange rate to break below 100, compared to a current level of nearly 105. We would also anticipate a sharp rise in the dollar against some emerging market currencies. For example, the Mexican peso could hit 25/$, versus 19/$ or so now.</p> <p>In our view, a Trump win would also have large effects on equities. For example, we think the S&amp;P 500 would fall below 2,000, compared to a current level of around 2,130. And many stock market indices elsewhere would probably fare worse. The Nikkei 225 could be hit especially hard by accompanying strength in the yen \u2013 we wouldn\u2019t be surprised if it tumbled below 15,000, versus a current level of more than 17,000.

But a plunge in risky asset prices would prompt a reassessment of the near-term outlook for Fed policy and boost the demand for safe havens.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the initial uncertainty following a victory for Trump would surely undermine the prices of industrial commodities, including oil and base metals, while gold would benefit from a renewed burst of safe-haven demand. In the short term, therefore, we would expect crude oil to fall to around $40 and gold to surge to at least $1,400. The impact of the dollar is a further wildcard. A big fall in the value of the US currency would limit the downside for the dollar prices of industrial commodities, while adding to the upside for gold. </p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5821ee7ae4b029b92ca46a78\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-11-08T15:31:34.879Z\">3.31pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Back with the presidential election, and if Hillary Clinton wins, it would give a green light to the Federal Reserve to raise US interest rates in December, says Kathleen Brooks, research director at City Index:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Markets have rushed to price in a rate hike from the Fed in recent days, the current implied probability of one 25 basis point hike next month is 82%, up from 68% a week ago.

  "<p>On Sunday, the capital city of one of the world\u2019s fastest growing economies was effectively shut down in an emergency act. The reason was not terrorism, but air pollution. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/nov/06/delhi-air-pollution-closes-schools-for-three-days\" title=\"\">threat to citizens from smog in Delhi</a> was judged so great that traffic was ratioined, coal-fired power stations closed and diesel generators suspended. This was a&#xa0;brave and sane decision in the world\u2019s largest democracy.</p> <p>Right now Delhi is the world\u2019s most polluted city. But air quality is at crisis levels in cities around the world. More than <a href=\"http://www.unicef.org/media/media_92979.html\" title=\"\">300 million children live at the severest risk, Unicef declared last week</a>, and 2 billion in areas where outdoor pollution exceeds health guidelines. Half of Delhi\u2019s schoolchildren have permanently impaired lung capacity, thanks to the air they breathe.</p> <p>India\u2019s capital city is telling people to stay away or work from home, but offering no compensation to those who cannot, or whose livelihood suffers. This can only be a short-term solution; it hurts those who can least bear it. Although the prime minister Theresa May will have been sheltered from the worst of the choking smog <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/nov/07/theresa-may-visa-offer-india-citizens-uk\" title=\"\">during her trip to India</a>, arriving in Delhi should have been a powerful warning about the effects of privileging growth over environmental concerns. Citizens of rich countries are sometimes too relaxed about such things when air pollution afflicts the richest cities as well as the poorest. That&#xa0;London has not yet been closed down in&#xa0;similar fashion to Delhi is only through lack&#xa0;of&#xa0;courage on the part of the government.</p> <p>Air quality in London has hit levels worse than those in Delhi and Beijing. Earlier this year, annual air pollution limits were breached in just a week. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/nov/02/high-court-rules-uk-government-plans-to-tackle-air-pollution-are-illegal\" title=\"\">Earlier this month, in&#xa0;what may be one of the last chances to bring EU law to bear on the issue, the high court ruled that the government had knowingly failed to draw up plans to bring it within legal limits</a> and there must be immediate action, even if that means drastic measures to curtail traffic.</p> <p>The causes of air pollution differ around the world, from coal-fired power plants to agricultural burning. One constant is traffic. Older cars and diesel engines produce particulates that clog up the lungs and may enter brain tissue, and nitrogen oxides that affect breathing. Car manufacturers were forced to admit last year that they had flouted tests on their diesel emissions. But the bigger question is why in a shortsighted attempt to reduce greenhouse gases by a tiny amount (diesel cars do more miles to the gallon) the risks were ignored, and customers persuaded that diesel cars were actually greener.</p> <p>Now that the consequences for air quality are clear, it is time to rebalance taxation and regulation in favour of petrol, which is cleaner though producing more carbon, and urgently incentivise electric cars. In London Sadiq Khan, the new mayor, to his credit has taken a strong line on air pollution, in contrast to Boris Johnson\u2019s tactics which amounted to unconvincing denial and attempts to silence scientists. Mr Khan should move faster still on banning the most polluting vehicles \u2013 he would find public support in inner London.</p> <p>Air pollution shames us all. From Beijing to Los Angeles, <a href=\"http://www.thelocal.fr/20160621/pollution-in-france-kills-48000-people-each-year\" title=\"\">Marseille</a> to Manila, the air we breathe in cities has deteriorated so much that it is no longer safe for children. Adults who grew up breathing cleaner air are more resilient in the face of polution. But when a child\u2019s lungs are damaged, they are damaged for life. The next generation already carries the burden of our inaction. This is a problem we know how to solve. Cut down coal-fired power, cut out diesel in cities, encourage electric cars and public transport. India should follow the declaration of emergency with long-term action, not just this short-term fix. Richer cities, London foremost among them, should be ashamed that they, with all their resources, have failed their children for so long. The high court judges were right. The&#xa0;government can and must act&#xa0;now.</p>",

We have a free press which is not always of the highest calibre.</p> <p>\u201cSensationalist and ill-informed attacks can undermine public confidence in the judiciary.

The right of the press to speak freely must be exercised responsibly; it is not a licence to attack judges in a personal manner or seek to undermine the constitutional principle of judicial independence, which is absolute.\u201d</p> <p>The human rights lawyer Philippe Sands called on Truss to resign, saying she had irrevocably lost the confidence of the legal profession.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/nov/08/liz-truss-defend-judges-article-50-stood-by\">Liz Truss swore to defend the judiciary.

  "<p>Royal Bank of Scotland did not tip healthy small businesses into default and did not seek to profit from their collapse. Nor did it request personal injections of cash from owners when it had already decided a business was doomed, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/nov/08/rbs-facing-400m-bill-to-compensate-small-business-customers\">says the Financial Conduct Authority</a>. But it did sometimes charge fees it didn\u2019t explain properly, and there was a failure to support small businesses \u201cin a manner consistent with good turnaround practice\u201d. Thus the bank will pay compensation to address \u201cpoor outcomes\u201d at a cost of about \u00a3400m. Is everybody happy now?</p> <p>Of course not. The period under the microscope is 2008-13, so the process of inspection has been painfully slow. The perception also remains that an apology, not to mention a few quid in redress, has had to be dragged out of RBS.</p> <p>The RBS chief executive, Ross McEwan, said on Tuesday the bank had \u201cacknowledged mistakes for some time\u201d, but the latest admission of shortcomings was fuller and franker than any heard previously.</p> <p>Indeed, back in 2014, when an internally commissioned report by the law firm Clifford Chance found no evidence that RBS set out to defraud its small business customers, the bank\u2019s tone verged on jubilant. Tuesday\u2019s response was necessarily humbler. RBS is still innocent on the explosive central charge of wrecking healthy businesses but the FCA\u2019s qualification was significant. Of the potentially viable business customers transferred into the controversial unit called the global restructuring group (GRG), \u201cmost of them experienced some form of inappropriate action by RBS\u201d, said the regulator. Not pretty.</p> <p>Incompetence at RBS \u2013 if that\u2019s what the regulator has decided \u2013 would be understandable. In 2008, the bank was bust and new management, after the state-funded bailout, was fighting fires on many fronts. It would not be a surprise if overwhelmed staff at GRG, facing a steep rise in defaults, took insufficient care with small businesses.</p> <p>Yet the process of ensuring redress has been uncertain and plodding. An adviser to Sir Vince Cable, when business secretary in the coalition government, first made allegations of shabby behaviour in 2013. The subsequent FCA inquiry has run a year behind schedule (and still hasn\u2019t been published in full). Now fees charged as long ago as 2008 will be returned in 2017 and complainants who still feel aggrieved can make their pleas to a retired high court judge, Sir William Blackburne.</p> <p>A just outcome, even when it arrives late, is better than an unjust one. But one sympathises with the small businesses. They should not have had to shout so loudly, or for so long, to be heard. The system has served them poorly.</p> <h2>Magic and sparkle dim at M&amp;S</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"883bd8110d4c1dff227b50c5c3e57cf13c254fa6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/883bd8110d4c1dff227b50c5c3e57cf13c254fa6/0_165_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Marks & Spencer logo\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">M&amp;S says 10% of floorspace devoted to clothing and homewares will close.

After <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/nov/08/m-and-s-marks-spencer-close-80-stores-major-overhaul\">his second on Tuesday</a>, which sought to answer the questions he raised in the spring, the fall was 5%. One can understand why investors are worried. Over the course of two outings in the City, Rowe has made a strong case that M&amp;S is in need of radical overhaul. But it\u2019s hard to conclude that his plan for action is as bold as his words.</p> <p>Shutting 53 wholly owned foreign stores sounds dramatic, of course. But the combined losses in the 10 affected countries were \u00a345m on turnover of \u00a3171m last year. If you are losing \u00a31 for every \u00a34 of revenue and see few opportunities for expansion, retreat is merely an act of common sense, even when the Champs \u00c9lys\u00e9es store in Paris was a pet project of your predecessor. Concentrating on franchise stores, where most of the risks sit with a franchisee with local knowledge, is more logical.</p> <p>The charge of timidity really concerns the UK. M&amp;S says 10% of floorspace devoted to clothing and homewares will close. Is that really enough? The clothing market is shifting online at pace and M&amp;S is seeking smaller (but sharper) ranges. A 10% slimming might be considered fearless if it were happening overnight but this is a five-year overhaul costing \u00a3350m, half of it in cash. Come 2021, it may be time to do it all over again.</p> <p>The supposed compensations for investors are twofold: M&amp;S is still generating plenty of cash and sees 200 pockets of the country that are deprived of the delights of Simply Food. The former is definitely a blessing, but less of the cash may find its way to investors: in the second-half of the financial year, shareholders will get an ordinary dividend but not a special on top. As for 200 more Simply Foods, the format is a proven winner but a 0.9% decline in like-for-like sales in the first half may be the first hint top-of-the-range food is becoming harder to shift.</p> <p>All in all, it\u2019s hard to find reasons to be cheerful. Underlying profits fell 18.6% to \u00a3231m in the first half and the next five years for M&amp;S look like hard graft for uncertain reward.</p>",

  "<p>The first thing you notice about Sam Almaliki is that he\u2019s a bundle of energy. Cricket Australia\u2019s (CA) head of community engagement talks clearly and fast, bursting with a constant stream of big ideas, which are even more interesting when you consider the place from which they come.</p> <p>A rising star of sports administration, Almaliki was only 24 years old when CA chief executive James Sutherland picked him for the role he\u2019s filled with passion and intensity since 2013. Age dictated he was an unconventional choice, but by then Almaliki had run an entire cricket league for a decade and absorbed more life experience than a lot of people manage in a lifetime.</p> <p>He is wary of discussing what he calls the \u201csad and sorry story\u201d of his arrival in Australia, preferring to focus on the work he\u2019s done in the last four years to broaden the appeal of cricket \u2013 a time in which female players have become full-time professionals and the game has built meaningful bridges to an ethnically diverse base of participants and enthusiasts.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/jun/20/when-i-play-its-not-like-they-say-oh-shes-a-refugee\">When I play, it\u2019s not like they say \u2018oh, she\u2019s a refugee\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Almaliki says he\u2019d work 24 hours a day if he could. In January of 2015 the 27-year-old\u2019s maniacal approach to work actually landed him in hospital with pericarditis and myocarditis. I ask him if he\u2019s completely mad. \u201cI guess that took its toll,\u201d he admits. \u201cBut I think it\u2019s being conscious of, \u2018How long are you there for? What are you trying to achieve? What costs are you prepared to pay?\u2019 I\u2019ve been very clear about what\u2019s needed to be achieved.\u201d<br></p> <p>What CA are working to achieve, he says, is for cricket to become inclusive of all Australians. \u201cIf you believe in equality and respect and inclusion, you apply that across all human beings, irrespective of gender, race, sexuality, culture or background,\u201d says Almaliki. \u201cThat\u2019s been so important for cricket.\u201d</p> <p>On that front, CA have actually started walking the talk in Almaliki\u2019s time, having recently integrated their disability teams into the Australian cricket pathway system, ending the era of players paying their own way, while fully professionalising the game for the Southern Stars women\u2019s team and making great strides in the same direction at domestic level, where even the AFL\u2019s new women\u2019s league, to name one, lags in terms of player payments.</p> <p>\u201cEveryone\u2019s getting on the bandwagon of female engagement, and that is great, but there is a massive gap between their passion for what is fashionable and what is right,\u201d Almaliki notes. \u201cWe can\u2019t be selective about equality and respect.\u201d </p> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s happening in the sports industry at the moment is that too many people are trying to out-do each other in the context of what is in fashion rather than what is right and what makes sense on a business and a social front. Being a sport for all Australians is fundamental to cricket\u2019s viability.\u201d</p> <p>Which is a decent place to point out the commercial reality faced by cricket: it actually must appeal to a broader array of Australians, particularly the women it long ignored, in order to remain financially viable. </p> <p>To that end, it\u2019s also been Almaliki\u2019s task to increase cricket participation amongst under-represented communities the game\u2019s administrators so often neglected, and he believes participation is the key to the entire \u201ccricket economy\u201d. If it\u2019s not strong, the knock-on effects are significant. </p> <p>On Almaliki\u2019s watch, for instance, Indigenous participation has risen at a national level from 8,500 to 36,000. \u201cAutomatically, as a result, if we keep at it we\u2019re going to see kids rise through,\u201d he says of the challenge to produce more professional players of Indigenous backgrounds. \u201cThey\u2019re going to feel more comfortable to be proud of their Indigenous heritage through cricket.\u201d<br></p> <p>It also makes Almaliki and CA more focused in their attempt to commemorate 1866 Indigenous team during this year\u2019s Boxing Day Test, which will feature 150th anniversary celebrations of the trailblazing side that toured England and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/sep/26/tom-wills-grave-restoration-project-reveals-footballs-heart-soul-and-history\">the contribution of Tom Wills</a>.</p> <p>\u201cWhen you haven\u2019t got a culture of inclusion you forget these stories,\u201d Almaliki says. \u201cThe game has developed a conscience it didn\u2019t have for much of its existence, and therefore we didn\u2019t tell the stories of 1866 as well as we should have, or the story of Faith Thomas, the first Indigenous woman to play a Test for Australia.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou only pursue the possibilities you\u2019re aware of, and how many Indigenous young people are aware of the possibility of playing cricket? Where are the role models and the heroes that provide clear visibility of that kind of possibility? When you demonstrate possibilities you inspire dreams, and that\u2019s where the game is getting to with the likes of Ashleigh Gardner and Dan Christian.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1be6aad6ee8e496f4d4837febc839fd7e17d52ba\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1be6aad6ee8e496f4d4837febc839fd7e17d52ba/0_0_4469_2975/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Cricket Australia head of community engagement Sam Almaliki\" width=\"1000\" height=\"666\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Cricket Australia head of community engagement Sam Almaliki says cricket has been central to his identity as a migrant Australian.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Stuart Walmsley</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Almaliki was eight years old when he, his parents and two brothers arrived in Australia on fake passports provided by people smugglers. Then, in 1997, an Iraqi family like the Almalikis could still come by plane. They came via Thailand, and were fleeing persecution they\u2019d faced under the regime of Saddam Hussein.</p> <p>A few hours after landing in Sydney, before linking up with his father and eldest brother, Almaliki, his mother and middle brother declared asylum, setting the wheels in motion for a trying eight-month period of detention in Villawood.</p> <p>Almaliki\u2019s father, Khalaf, had been a political scientist before they fled, a job that played a major role in the family\u2019s decision to leave. \u201cHe was under constant surveillance and monitoring,\u201d Almaliki says. \u201cHe had one of his brothers and four of his cousins killed by the government. My two older teenage brothers were facing the prospect of conscription, so the situation was pretty bad.\u201d </p> <p>At Villawood Almaliki learned English from scratch and so quickly that within three months he was acting as an interpreter to the Arabic-speaking detainees, working alongside a legal aid barrister and developing an early passion for advocacy and the law. He didn\u2019t realise the significance at the time, but Villawood was also where he glimpsed cricket for the first time, watching Tamil asylum seekers play spirited games.</p> <p>Otherwise it was a traumatic period for the family. Almaliki\u2019s father suffered what were later revealed to be two heart attacks, for which he received no medical treatment. Worse for the families\u2019 nerves were the constant announcements over speakers in the cramped detention centre. So often was their name called, and so frequent were the rejections of their claim, that every time a voice came through the PA system they stood and prepared themselves, anticipating some new indignity. \u201cIt was this constant anxiety and panic,\u201d Almaliki says.</p> <p>Thankfully their final appeal, to then federal immigration minister Phillip Ruddock, was upheld, but relief was tempered by a serious heart operation to Almaliki\u2019s father in the months following and the harsh adjustment to their new life in Australia. Almaliki\u2019s mother Najat, a university academic, had to take work in a sweet shop and the family moved into the first of eight homes they\u2019ve lived in since migrating. </p> <p>Before that, even negotiating the local shopping centre in Campsie presented challenges. \u201cWe were so exhausted after a hundred metres because we hadn\u2019t walked that distance in eight months,\u201d Almaliki says. \u201cI\u2019m sure it\u2019s a feeling that many prisoners have.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat was a character-defining period. And I think it\u2019s really made me dogged. I struggle with \u2018no\u2019 as an answer and always believe there\u2019s a way. Sometimes that\u2019s hopeful and optimistic, at other times it\u2019s naive.\u201d </p> <p>Perhaps naivety helped. How else to explain Almaliki\u2019s path from the \u201cESL\u201d kid at Punchbowl Primary school to the executive suites of Australia\u2019s national game? He says a teacher named Rowan Hall was the first in a long line of \u201ccricket people\u201d who sparked something in the youngster though the sport. \u201cVillawood gave me visibility of cricket,\u201d Almaliki says, \u201che inspired my interest in the game.\u201d </p> <p>Like all child refugees, he says he had to grow up fast, developing persistence, resilience and independence. \u201cI see very few young people of refugee background who don\u2019t inspire me to be a better person,\u201d he says. \u201cThe necessities of life see you develop in ways you otherwise wouldn\u2019t seek to.\u201d</p> <p>In this case, it was cricket that offered social mobility and a window of opportunity. Stubborn and independent, Almaliki walked by himself from the family\u2019s public housing estate to a registration trial of the local Beverley Hills Eagles Cricket Club, winning a premiership in his first year with the Under-14s, bowling leg spin. \u201cYou can\u2019t have that much life and not be a leggie,\u201d Almaliki jokes. \u201cUnfortunately I had the wrong temperament for a leggie. I had a fast bowler\u2019s temperament. I wanted to get batsmen out every ball.\u201d</p> <p>Within a few years some of the coaches and administrators he came across as a player were effectively Almaliki\u2019s underlings when he decided that Sydney needed a winter competition and started his own; three teams to start with but eventually 96 and recognition from state cricket officials who\u2019d snubbed him to start with. </p> <p>\u201cThen and there at 15, it was clear to me that my career as a cricketer was never going to go far,\u201d he says. \u201cBut there was a potential to become an administrator and get involved in the game that way.\u201d </p> <p>One criticism CA often face is that their leadership ranks are filled with people who have no feel for cricket, nor the people who play and administer it at grassroots level. Almaliki says that you can\u2019t always match up the professional requirements of high level administrative roles with a burning individual passion for the game, a knowledge gap that perhaps explains his own rise.</p> <p>\u201cI seek to continue to be not too far removed from the people who make cricket happen, day-in, day-out,\u201d he says. \u201cWe administer cricket on their behalf, rather than the other way around.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"97292bdc37998be8fd4ae0e30bfc97ca743fa9ee\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/97292bdc37998be8fd4ae0e30bfc97ca743fa9ee/0_0_3000_2000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Usman Khawaja\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Role models such as Usman Khawaja are vital for the growth of cricket in Australia, says Almaliki.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Daniel Carson/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>What\u2019s also important for the Australian game is the diversity of the current playing ranks at national and domestic level. \u201cUsman Khawaja is a classic example,\u201d Almaliki says. \u201cHe\u2019s a licensed pilot, he\u2019s finished university. He\u2019s batting at number three for Australia and he\u2019s captaining Queensland, one of the most parochial states when it comes to issues of multiculturalism, yet its cricket skipper is the first cricketer of Islamic faith to play for Australia. It goes to show that you can find a way.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cFundamentally it\u2019s about role models if we\u2019re really going to get people to believe that they can play for Australia, in either our women\u2019s or men\u2019s side. It\u2019s so important in allowing young people of all backgrounds to see themselves in the mirror, to see heroes they can relate to.\u201d</p> <p>When we return to the framing of the refugee debate in Australia, Almaliki says that \u201ccommon sense gets lost in the extremes,\u201d though adds that his own political aspirations are \u201cnon-existent\u201d. He can make greater societal impact through sport and business, he thinks.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2015/sep/14/football-and-refugees-in-australia-the-important-role-the-game-can-still-play\">Football and refugees in Australia: the important role the game can still play</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cI find on an individual level that most Australians are compassionate and fair,\u201d Almaliki says.

  "<p>When The Crown debuted on Netflix last week, it drew immediate attention for its lavish look and for creator Peter Morgan\u2019s ambition to spend nearly 60 hours telling the full story of Queen Elizabeth II, from her youth to today. The Crown also raised eyebrows for the news that its backers spent over $100m to produce the series\u2019 first 10 episodes. Twenty years ago, the goal of any TV producer was to keep costs low and to make enough episodes to get a syndication deal, so that the money for reruns would keep rolling in. These days, companies are willing to spend big on just one short season, knowing that some viewers tend to look at high production values as a sign that a show\u2019s worth binge-watching.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JWtnJjn6ng0\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/JWtnJjn6ng0?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>There are multiple reasons why a series can end up costing millions of dollars per episode \u2013 including cases like ER or Friends, where the show\u2019s popularity drives up the cast\u2019s salaries. With premium cable productions like HBO\u2019s Game of Thrones and Starz\u2019s Outlander, the feature film-level budgets tend to go unremarked upon, because the programs are so popular that no one pays much attention to how much they cost. But when reports surface on mega-deals like Amazon\u2019s just-announced $160m 16-episode Robert De Niro/Julianne Moore/David O Russell series, it\u2019s hard not to notice the huge risk.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/nov/03/the-crown-windsor-claire-foy-elizabeth-blockbuster\">The Crown: a huge ocean-going blockbuster \u2013 the Americans will love it</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Here then are a handful of expensive TV shows where the price tag has become as much a part of the conversation about them as anything actually on the screen.</p> <h2><strong>The Crown/The Get Down (Netflix)</strong></h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usv442G6H8A\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/usv442G6H8A?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>Netflix\u2019s decision-makers drive conventional television programmers batty with their willingness to spend lavishly, regardless of commercial prospects.

In both cases, the price is part of the pitch, luring subscribers with the promise that their money is buying something they won\u2019t find anywhere else.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2016/aug/07/baz-luhrmann-the-get-down-rappers-delight\">Why Baz Luhrmann\u2019s The Get Down is a rapper\u2019s delight</a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong>Worth it?</strong> The jury\u2019s still out on The Crown, which launched with great fanfare and has drawn some strong (but not ecstatic) reviews in the early going. Because Netflix is stingy with hard viewership data, it may be a while before we know whether The Crown\u2019s a hit. Third-party research suggests that Luhrmann\u2019s folly has disappointed with an estimated 3.2 million viewers in the 18-49 demo in the first month, less than half of the audience of the platform\u2019s most popular shows. </p> <h2><strong>Vinyl/Rome/Deadwood (HBO)</strong></h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iphllcTYOs\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/1iphllcTYOs?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>It\u2019d be very easy to fill this list completely with HBO originals, given that the most premium of the premium cablers has a long history of laying out cash for everything from the vintage Atlantic City recreations of Boardwalk Empire to the star-studded cop action in True Detective. But some of the channel\u2019s most memorable would-be blockbusters have been the ones that never caught on enough to justify their bills, such as the soapy \u201970s rock music melodrama Vinyl (where the first episode alone cost $30m) the historical epic Rome (where HBO and the BBC split a budget of nearly $10m per episode) and the earthy, arty western Deadwood (which spent a comparatively modest $4.5m an episode to reconstruct an American frontier town). None of these series got to tell the full stories their creators intended; but each spent big to evoke bygone places and times.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2016/jan/11/deadwood-movie-film-what-to-watch-five-tv-shows\">Deadwood: what to watch until the movie rides into town</a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong>Worth it?</strong> Deadwood remains beloved enough to land in the top 10 of critics Alan Sepinwall and Matt Zoller Seitz\u2019s new \u201cbest television of all time\u201d survey TV: The Book; and Rome has its cult as well. It\u2019s Vinyl though that will be a cautionary tale in the HBO offices for years to come, framed as a boondoggle so costly that it became one of the rare series to be renewed for a second season and then cancelled before any new episodes could be written or shot.</p> <h2><strong>Terra Nova/Utopia (Fox)</strong></h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Oux-2iZfNc\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/4Oux-2iZfNc?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>The cable kingpins and streaming services don\u2019t have a monopoly on overpaying. In the 2010s, Fox gambled twice on concepts so complicated to execute that the network went ahead and put them on the primetime schedule without pilot episodes, because the executives figured that once they\u2019d spent the money to build the sets, they may as well use them. That\u2019s how TV viewers ended up with 13 episodes of Terra Nova, a strange science-fiction/cop show about a law enforcement officer who travels through time to live in a new colony established in a prehistoric era \u2013 complete with dinosaurs. The $20m two-hour premiere alone made the project hard to scrap. Even heavy preproduction expenditures couldn\u2019t save Utopia, a Big Brother/Survivor-style \u201cliving with strangers in the middle of nowhere\u201d reality series that was supposed to air twice a week for a full year, but was instead scratched after two months, before anybody had \u201cwon\u201d the \u201cgame\u201d. An elaborate set was supposed to pay for itself through repeated use, but the reported $50m experiment never got the chance to cover the network\u2019s investment.</p> <p><strong>Worth it?</strong> Kudos to Fox for taking a big swing, and trying to recapture the buzzy weirdness of ABC\u2019s Lost \u2013 a few years after such shows had become too extravagant for network TV. Still, if a channel\u2019s going to take these kinds of chances, the product has to be good. Terra Nova barely rose above mediocre, despite everyone\u2019s best efforts; and Utopia looked and felt like every other cheap reality competition, despite how much its custom-built location cost.</p> <h2><strong>Viva Laughlin (CBS)</strong></h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vtonEFBeZk\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/9vtonEFBeZk?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>Television has long struggled with how to integrate full-scale musical numbers into a weekly show, with some efforts (like Glee and Galavant) paying off either commercially or critically, and others (like Cop Rock) flopping miserably. CBS\u2019s Nevada-set dramedy Viva Laughlin seemed to have an edge with the participation of stage and movie star Hugh Jackman \u2013 a beloved, award-winning singer and dancer. But its premise was too vague, and its pop covers too corny. Even worse, the pilot alone cost nearly $7m, raising legitimate concerns over whether the music rights and elaborate production design were going to be an ongoing problem. Rather than risk ruin, the network cancelled Viva Laughlin after only two episodes aired.</p> <p><strong>Worth it?</strong> CBS has a reputation as the network that takes the fewest chances, so the real shame in the failure of something like Viva Laughlin is that it convinces an already cautious outlet to be even less adventurous. TV fans suffer as a result \u2026 even if it means we don\u2019t have to endure another show this bad.</p> <h2><strong>Battlestar Galactica (ABC)</strong></h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hrd767Xzfk\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/8hrd767Xzfk?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>The popularity of Star Wars gave writer/producer Glen A Larson an opportunity to pitch a longstanding dream project of his: an interstellar \u201cman against robot\u201d quest saga loosely inspired by his Mormon faith. ABC backed Battlestar Galactica with the then-princely sum of a million dollars an episode, and the series got off to a promising start in the ratings, but even with the extra cash, the effects weren\u2019t up to the standard of a major motion picture, and the stories were too juvenile to compensate for the shoddiness.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2016/oct/20/worst-tv-pilots-ever\">The worst TV pilots ever: a Waterworld prequel, drag-racing PIs and furry fetish</a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong>Worth it? </strong>Absolutely, if only because this quirky little cash-in inspired the SyFy Channel\u2019s brilliant 21st century reimagining.</p> <h2><strong>Kings/Supertrain (NBC)</strong></h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gUERtAe73NI\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/gUERtAe73NI?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>It\u2019s hard even to explain Kings, a retelling of the biblical story of David set in an alternate history version of our modern times. But whatever creator Michael Green had in mind, it required a huge cast of characters and a budget for costumes and art direction that reportedly pushed each episode past the $4m mark \u2013 or too much to pay for the series\u2019 paltry viewership. After one 13-episode season, Kings ended up on the same shelf as other big-ticket NBC misses, alongside 1979\u2019s Supertrain, a bizarre attempt to replicate the success of ABC\u2019s anthology series The Love Boat, on \u2026 well, a really big train. And not just any big train, but one that was said to have cost $5m to build.</p> <p><strong>Worth it?</strong> Supertrain is a legendary botch, representative of the general creative bankruptcy and crass commercial instincts of TV executives in the late \u201970s and early \u201980s. Kings though was a thing of beauty: a bold, unclassifiable hybrid of history, fantasy and literature. No matter how much they cost, without flawed experiments like Kings, television would dry up altogether as an art form.</p>",

  "<p>The stress of Brexit is adding to pressure on couples on the brink of divorce, according to the head of the UK\u2019s largest family law organisation.</p> <p>For partners who voted different ways in the referendum, the difficulty of reconciling opposing political views may be the final straw, said <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/nov/09/legal-aid-cuts-no-fault-divorce\">Nigel Shepherd, the chair of Resolution</a>, which represents solicitors and those involved in family law across England and Wales.</p> <p>His comments come as a Dutch entrepreneur announced plans to set up a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/aug/23/divorce-new-rules-splitting-up-amicable-marriage-breakup\">divorce hotel</a> in the UK to help separating couples sort out their problems over the course of a weekend. <br></p> <p>Law firms regularly send out press releases warning that Christmas or long summer holidays will trigger a fresh wave of relationship breakdowns, but few such cautions were circulated before the EU referendum in June.</p> <p>For some people, the Brexit vote was a traumatic rupture from the idea of a European union. Shepherd said divergent political perspectives could reinforce personal misunderstandings. </p> <p>\u201cWe have come across a number of families in this country [who are splitting up] because one them voted differently [to the other] in the referendum,\u201d Shepherd said. \u201cThey fell out in a big way because one voted for remain and one for leave.</p> <p>\u201cI suspect that was unlikely to have been the sole reason [for divorce] but we have heard of cases from a number of our members. It was a really divisive campaign. It pushed some couples [over the edge]. It was the last straw that made them think \u2018we are really incompatible\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>A similar phenomenon <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/14/fashion/marriage-politics-donald-trump-hillary-clinton.html?_r=0\">has been observed in the US</a> among warring couples split between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton. <br></p> <p>The legal ramifications of Brexit is also proving a challenge for lawyers. \u201cWe prepare quite a lot of pre-nuptial agreements under the European system but we can\u2019t say now where we would like issues determined,\u201d Shepherd said. \u201cWe don\u2019t know what marriage regulations will exist.\u201d</p> <p>The idea of a divorce hotel, soothing the process of the final breakup, comes from Jim Halfens, who was a commercial manager in a Dutch law firm.</p> <p>There are already divorce hotels in the Netherlands and the US. Halfens plans to open one in northern England early next year. The idea is for partners to negotiate the final terms of their separation and mark the formal ending of a relationship.</p> <p>Halfens said he came up with the idea after a friend went through a \u201cdreadful and drawn-out\u201d divorce. Only couples who are on speaking terms are likely to be allowed to attend and fees are likely to be around \u00a35,000.</p> <p>\u201cYou start together and you end together,\u201d Halfens explained. \u201cYou don\u2019t need your mother-in-law or new girlfriend to be there. You sit there for two days and you get to solve this issue.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a pressure cooker where you need to find a solution. It hardly ever happens that [a couple] are not able to solve a divorce. Like this, you know when it starts and ends. You can say it\u2019s a pity that the marriage failed but the divorce should be a positive note in your new life.\u201d </p> <p>The soon-to-be exes are allocated separate rooms in the hotel. \u201cSometimes I thought couples might get back together, but everyone who goes to the divorce hotel goes through to a divorce,\u201d Halfens said. \u201cIt has happened that they sleep in the same room, but they have still gone through with the breakup.\u201d</p> <p>David Leckie, a family mediator who will be the UK hotel\u2019s manager, said: \u201cIt is helpful for people to acknowledge the ending of a relationship in a formal way. Otherwise it\u2019s like people dying without having a funeral. It\u2019s symbolic. It leads to a more positive ongoing relationship with their children.\u201d</p> <p>Asked about the effect of Brexit on relationships, he agreed that it was having a negative impact. \u201cIt has imposed an added strain on relationships, one in which people might not be talking to each other as well. Brexit has been an issue,\u201d he said.</p>",

In April the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.accc.gov.au/system/files/East%20Coast%20Gas%20Inquiry%20key%20findings_0.pdf\">found evidence</a> that \u201ca large number of pipeline operators have been engaging in monopoly pricing\u201d.</p> <p>The ACCC pointed out that other countries, such as New Zealand and the US, imposed much stronger regulation. Since pipelines are natural monopolies, they are able to dictate prices.</p> <p>\u201cIt is well recognised in these jurisdictions that pipelines can wield substantial market power even where producers and users have a number of transportation options,\u201d the ACCC said.</p> <p>Cartwright told the conference the federal minister for the environment and energy, Josh Frydenberg, had told her he wanted to regulate gas pipelines.</p> <p>\u201cMinister Frydenberg actually said to me, quote, \u2018I know supply needs to be addressed but we\u2019re going to fix pipelines first,\u2019\u2019\u2019 Cartwright was reported saying in <a href=\"http://www.energynewsbulletin.net/storyview.asp?storyID=826967733&amp;feature=Pipelines&amp;sectionsource=f2874525&amp;aspdsc=yes\">Energy News Bulletin</a>.</p> <p>\u201cBasically, they are convinced there is something wrong and they want to be able to make an announcement,\u201d Cartwright reportedly said.</p> <p>Cartwright told the gas industry meeting they needed to give Frydenberg \u201csomething to announce\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cSo this is what we are up against,\u201d she said. \u201cNot only do we need to fight back, we have to do it in a way that gives them something to announce and actually I think we can do it.\u201d</p> <p>Cartwright told Guardian Australia she understood that looked like an attempt to give the minister a meaningless announcement but that was not the case.</p> <p>She said she was trying to explain to members of the industry \u201cwho know nothing about politics \u2026 explaining to them that we can\u2019t just fight back and say everything is working without demonstrating that we are actually doing something to tackle the perception of there being a problem\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cWe are taking action \u2013 not necessarily the action demanded by the regulator, but something that\u2019ll actually work \u2013 and we need to explain that to the ministers so they can be part of the announcements when it\u2019s ready to launch.\u201d</p> <p>Cartwright said the plan was to improve transparency of the gas pipeline market through reforms in \u201ccapacity trading\u201d, where spare capacity in the pipelines is traded in a transparent process.</p> <p>She said many members of the industry had fought that move \u201cbecause it will be expensive\u201d.</p> <p>Responding to the industy lobbyists\u2019 comments, Frydenberg told Guardian Australia: \u201cThe ACCC in a recent report raised its concerns with the current regulatory test as it applies to gas pipelines.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/aug/19/gas-supplies-to-rise-and-secret-contracts-to-be-scrapped-under-coag-reform-plan\">Gas supplies to rise and secret contracts to be scrapped under Coag reform plan</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cThat is why the [Council of Australian Governments] energy council has asked Dr Michael Vertigan, in consultation with stakeholders and working with the ACCC findings, to draw together what we need to do with the coverage criteria under the national gas law to address this issue.</p> <p>\u201cMinisters will consider Dr Vertigan\u2019s report at the next Coag energy council meeting.\u201d</p> <p>The Coag energy council <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/aug/19/gas-supplies-to-rise-and-secret-contracts-to-be-scrapped-under-coag-reform-plan\">announced in August</a> that it had agreed to ban secret pricing contracts in the gas industry. Frydenberg described the change as \u201cthe most significant reforms to the domestic gas market in two decades\u201d.</p> <p>It did not propose regulating prices, which other commentators have suggested, but which the gas industry strongly opposes.</p> <p>\u201cOf course, if you want to phase out oil and gas completely, you might like the idea of increasing economic regulation, which would stymie investment,\u201d Cartwright told Guardian Australia.</p> <p>Bruce Robertson, an analyst at the pro-renewable Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis, said the industry was overdue for regulation.</p> <p>\u201cThe pipeline companies are gouging the consumer,\u201d he said. \u201cThey know it and are fearful that sensible regulation as to price and capacity will come in. Essentially gas transmission pipelines are natural monopolies and Australia is unique in the western world at not regulating them.</p> <p>\u201cThe US has far better disclosure rules and still heavily regulates them. In Australia we need both far more comprehensive disclosure on a pipeline by pipeline basis and also strong regulation. Regulation of monopolies is not anti market. No market exists and hence the need for regulation.\u201d</p>",

When it considered the top 100 bestselling titles for the year to date, there was just one British BAME author in the list \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/jan/27/buried-giant-kazuo-ishiguro-review-nicholas-lezard\">Kazuo Ishiguro with his novel The Buried Giant</a>, which had sold just over 100,000 copies to make 59th place. By contrast, the list of 100 titles, The Bookseller pointed out, featured 11 books by authors called David. The next UK BAME author was <a href=\"http://www.dorothykoomson.co.uk/\">Dorothy Koomson</a>, in 156th place with the commercial novel That Girl from Nowhere, with Syed\u2019s Black Box Thinking the third and final author in the top 300, in 169th place with sales of just over 57,000 copies.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/tools/tables/embed/index.html?spreadsheet=1WKWUEFCkMHN2mBpUMwB3ACrR6wXfShyDDpxMfv9w2Fw\" data-alt=\"Bestselling British BAME authored books in 2016\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/tools/tables/embed/index.html?spreadsheet=1WKWUEFCkMHN2mBpUMwB3ACrR6wXfShyDDpxMfv9w2Fw\">Bestselling British BAME authored books in 2016</a> </figure>  <p>\u201cOf the top 500 titles for 2016, 343 were written by UK authors, of which 1.7% were penned by BAME Brits. That drops to 1.2% when extrapolated to the top 500. Considering the BAME population of England and Wales is around 15%, this is shockingly low,\u201d writes the Bookseller\u2019s charts editor Kiera O\u2019Brien, pointing in comparison to America, which has 30 American BAME-authored titles in its top 500, and 19 in its top 300, equivalent to 6% of the list.</p> <p>Despite the low numbers \u2013 three UK BAME authors in the top 300, and six in the top 500 \u2013 2016\u2019s charts to date are actually more diverse than in previous years, The Bookseller found. Last year, the bestselling BAME-authored title was The Art of Eating Well by Jasmine and Melissa Hemsley, in 195th place, following by <a href=\"http://www.lalinepaull.com/\">Laline Paull</a>\u2019s novel The Bees, in 315th. In 2014, it was Yotam Ottolenghi\u2019s Plenty More in 221st, followed by Koomson\u2019s The Flavours of Love in 606th.</p> <p>\u201cThere is an acknowledgement that the UK publishing industry isn\u2019t publishing a representative number of BAME British writers and we wanted to look at the actual figures. We felt it was important to make the distinction that we were looking specifically for British writers, because it\u2019s one thing to publish writers like Ta-Nehisi Coates and Roxane Gay, and another to nurture British talent from ethnic minorities,\u201d said The Bookseller\u2019s Sarah Shaffi, who edited the issue.</p> <p>\u201cWhile publishing is doing lots to improve diversity, we wanted to know where it stood when it came to how many British BAME authors are published each year; the time was right to really talk about the situation as it is.\u201d</p> <p>The Bookseller also published <a href=\"http://www.thebookseller.com/insight/seeing-colour-426046\">a series of essays by BAME employees in publishing</a> this week, commissioned by HarperCollins non-fiction publisher Natalie Jerome, who called <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.thebookseller.com/blogs/dear-next-generation-426051\">in her own piece</a> for more editors from BAME backgrounds to be hired. \u201cQuite frankly, it\u2019s the fastest, most effective way we\u2019ll tackle the overwhelming lack of diversity and the fact that the content we produce doesn\u2019t always reflect the society in which we live today. It\u2019s not rocket science. If the decision-makers are not diverse, nor will our books be,\u201d wrote Jerome.</p> <p>Kwaku Osei-Afrifa, executive PA at Titan Entertainment Group, wrote of how \u201cprogress is slow, but it\u2019s happening\u201d <a href=\"http://www.thebookseller.com/blogs/i-am-black-man-and-it-feels-especially-great-say-year-426101\">in his essay</a>. \u201cThere\u2019s a double-edged sword to this; one I\u2019ve not felt more keenly than when I was invited to speak on a diversity in publishing panel and the chair \u2013 someone I know \u2013 mispronounced my name. (There are people in my current workplace who continue to say my name incorrectly, despite hearing it the right way for six months.) My solace was my participation in the event,\u201d wrote Osei-Afrifa. \u201cBut too often these panels talk about us, not to us. This is a wall that shows no signs of coming down, when even on panels about minorities, we are the minority.\u201d</p> <p>Last year\u2019s Writing the Future report from Spread the Word found that 8% of publishers\u2019 work forces self-identified as coming from BAME backgrounds, according to estimates from publishers.</p> <p>\u201cTwelve years ago [after publication of a previous report into the issue, In Full Colour] there were all these initiatives to bring in people of colour, but they were all very much at base level. When I did the report last year, those people are the ones who should have been on the boards, and they just weren\u2019t there,\u201d said the report author, Danuta Kean. \u201cI think there\u2019s been a disconnect between the intentions of publishers and their practice, and it\u2019s down to this whole issue of unconscious bias.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI think the industry has moved on from talking about diversity, and from endless panels on the subject, to actually doing something about it,\u201d said Shaffi, pointing to initiatives including <a href=\"http://www.thebookseller.com/news/carole-blake-open-doors-project-founded-agents-memory-426396\">the Blake Friedmann literary agency\u2019s new \u201copen doors project\u201d</a>, launched in memory of the late agent and intending to encourage applicants from diverse backgrounds. Penguin Random House also recently launched the WriteNow project, looking for work from diverse new writers.</p> <p>Although The Bookseller found that \u201cof the thousands of titles published in 2016 in the UK, only a small minority \u2013 fewer than 100 \u2013 were by British authors of a non-white background\u201d, Shaffi predicted this could be set to change next year, saying she was looking forward to titles including Nadiya Hussain\u2019s first novel; Slay in Your Lane by Yomi Adegoke and Elizabeth Uviebinene, described as a guide to life for a generation of black British women; ; Diversify by June Sarpong, an \u201cintelligent and empowering\u201d polemic about the limitations created by social division; and The Young Magicians and the Thieves Almanac by Nick Mohammed, a middle-grade mystery-adventure.</p> <p>\u201cChange is slow, but it is there, and hopefully we will not be having these discussions in 10 years\u2019 time,\u201d Shaffi said.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Kean had her eye on a particular indicator of equality: \u201cWe\u2019ll know things have really changed next year if black and Asian authors are not just publishing literary fiction, but also in the big commercial genres,\u201d she said.</p>",

In the final series of the long-running oil industry drama The Troubleshooters (1971), he played James Langley, the liberal deputy chairman of Mogul Oil who knocked heads with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2005/nov/10/broadcasting.guardianobituaries\">Geoffrey Keen</a>\u2019s scheming and hard-nosed autocrat Brian Stead.</p> <p>His aptitude for snarling villains made him perfect casting as the evil squire in Hammer\u2019s The Plague of the Zombies (1966) and he also appeared in Taste the Blood of Dracula (1970), and in Captain Kronos \u2013 Vampire Hunter (1974), achieving second billing for his turn as the tragic Dr Marcus (enduring an unsuccessful staking and hanging in order to prevent his metamorphosis into one of the undead).</p> <p>Although he had a memorably saturnine face with deep blue eyes which could burn with malevolence or twinkle on demand, his voice was just as recognisable. Described by the Guardian as having \u201cthe languid opulence of a falling \u00a310 note\u201d it was put into good service on a number of television advertisements, notably when his seductive tones \u2013 which often found him mistaken for the similar sounding <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2009/may/15/james-mason\">James Mason</a> \u2013 accompanied <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2011/jan/31/john-barry-obituary\">John Barry</a>\u2019s score on the advertising campaign for Sunsilk shampoo.</p> <p>Son of British parents, Elizabeth and Cyril Carson-Parker, he was born in Colombo, Ceylon (now Sri Lanka), where his father worked on tea and rubber plantations. Educated in Australia during the second world war, John went to Britain to do national service as an artillery officer in an anti-aircraft regiment in 1944-45. After a period as a pianist\u2019s page turner at Covent Garden (where he got his first taste for the theatre), he studied law at Queen\u2019s College, Oxford, and then left for New Zealand.</p> <p>While there he performed in amateur theatre before working in professional radio drama, learning all facets of the business from acting to music selection. He then joined the theatre company the New Zealand Players before working his way back to the UK.</p> <p>Having established himself with seasons at Sheffield in the late 1950s he then limited his stage work, though it included playing Will Roper in the original production of A Man For All Seasons at the Globe theatre in London (1960), with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2008/mar/20/2\">Paul Scofield</a> as Sir Thomas More. One of his favourite roles was the well-meaning Freddie for Michael Blakemore in the premiere of Peter Nichols\u2019s A Day in the Death of Joe Egg (Comedy theatre, 1967, transferring to Broadway in 1968).</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSeKnzIfyPY\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/xSeKnzIfyPY?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>John Carson played Mr Knightley in the TV version of Jane Austen\u2019s Emma, 1972</figcaption> </figure>   <p>He appeared in the film Quentin Durward in 1955 and then moved on to television fare, including Sword of Freedom (1957) and Ivanhoe (playing numerous guest roles in 1958 and 1959). After the fame Emergency Ward 10 gave him he enjoyed a healthy three decades on TV and was rarely out of work. His parts included Monks in a 13-episode Oliver Twist with Max Adrian as Fagin, 1962, Count von Stauffenberg, Hitler\u2019s would-be assassin, in the Wednesday Play The July Plot (1964), Mr Dombey in Dombey and Son (1969), Mr Knightley in a six-part version of Emma (1972), Heatherstone in Children of the New Forest (1977) and two Dennis Potter plays, Paper Roses (1971) and Shmoedipus (1974). Between his appearances in The Avengers (1963-1965) and Poirot (1989-2005) he appeared as the guest lead in practically every popular drama on television.</p> <p>In 1983 he moved to South Africa for family reasons. Not being well known there, he had to build a career again but was soon playing leading roles. With no sympathy for apartheid, he found his phone was bugged (his second wife, Luanshya Greer, was a writer whose historical novels explored themes of racial division) and he was under government surveillance \u2013 something he found especially pertinent when playing Thomas Becket in a 1992 stage production of Murder in the Cathedral, at St George\u2019s Cathedral in Cape Town. He was very useful to visiting film and television productions, appearing in the TV mini-series Shaka Zulu (1986) and Rhodes (1996, with Martin Shaw).</p> <p>His last major film roles were as a forgetful old actor in The Deal, with William H Macy, and in Neil Marshall\u2019s Doomsday (both 2008). His return to Britain in 2007 saw more television appearances \u2013 Doctors (2011), Silent Witness (2012) and Midsomer Murders (2013) \u2013 but he eventually went back to South Africa.</p> <p>He is survived by Luanshya and their two children, Ben and Suzanna, and by four children, Richard, Chris, Katie and Harry, from a previous marriage, which ended in divorce.</p> <p><em> </em>\u2022 John Carson (John Derek Carson-Parker), actor, born 28 February 1927; died 5 November 2016</p>",
  "<p>Rarely, in the long and turbulent history of the royal family\u2019s relationship with the press, has a palace spokesman used such direct and outspoken language. \u201cThe past week has seen a line crossed,\u201d Kensington Palace said of the coverage of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/prince-harry\">Prince Harry</a>\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/nov/08/prince-harry-lambasts-press-over-meghan-markle-coverage\">relationship with the US TV actor Meghan Markle</a>. Saying the prince fears for Markle\u2019s safety, the spokesman added: \u201cThis is not a game. It is her life and his.\u201d</p> <p>The intervention will certainly have captured attention in tabloid newsrooms, but it is unlikely to usher in a permanent truce in a relationship that has been strained for the best part of 30 years. The decision to issue such a forthright statement is evidence, however, of the increasingly proactive approach that Kensington Palace is taking with the media, particularly in response to coverage of Harry and the family of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/prince-william\">Prince William</a>.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/nov/08/prince-harry-lambasts-press-over-meghan-markle-coverage\">Prince Harry lambasts press over coverage of girlfriend Meghan Markle</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge took a similarly direct approach last year when their spokesman wrote to editors warning that some paparazzi were using <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/aug/14/palace-increasingly-dangerous-paparazzi-tactics-prince-george-duke-duchess-cambridge\">\u201cdangerous tactics\u201d</a> to obtain photos of their son, Prince George, and \u201cprofit from the image of a two-year-old boy\u201d.</p> <p>That letter said photographers had stalked the prince\u2019s nanny, used toddlers to lure him into view and been discovered hiding in fields and woodland around their Norfolk home. It also claimed a photographer had set up a \u201chide\u201d in his car, complete with sheets and supplies of food and drink, as he staked out a play area.</p> <p>The royals have also appealed to the Independent Press Standards Organisation for protection. Earlier this year, Prince Harry <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/may/20/prince-harry-pippa-middleton-daily-star-sun-ipso\">forced the Daily Star to retract a claim</a> he had an affair with the Duchess of Cambridge\u2019s sister, Pippa Middleton, after complaining to Ipso.

In 2002, Harry was <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/1757448.stm\">exposed for drinking underage and using cannabis</a>; two years later, he was <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/3762200.stm\">involved in a scuffle with reporters</a> as he left a nightclub, reportedly shouting: \u201cWhy don\u2019t you leave me alone?\u201d</p> <p>In 2007, as the relationship between William and Kate Middleton intensified, the then regulator, the Press Complaints Commission, circulated a letter to editors claiming Middleton was being harassed. It worked. The publisher of the Sun and News of the World announced that it <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2007/jan/09/newsinternational.royalsandthemedia\">would no longer publish paparazzi pictures</a> of her. MPs <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/6290066.stm\">later said she had been \u201chounded\u201d</a> and subjected to \u201cpersistent harassment\u201d.</p> <p>The couple were <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2011/may/03/royal-honeymooners-left-alone-tabloids-pledge\">largely left alone on honeymoon</a> after their marriage in 2011, but when topless photographs of the duchess emerged the following year the <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/sep/14/kate-william-furious-topless-photographs\">palace was furious</a>, calling them a \u201cgrotesque and totally unjustifiable\u201d invasion of privacy, and saying it would be \u201cunthinkable\u201d for anyone to reproduce them. The photographs did not appear in a mainstream UK publication, but were published in the French magazine Closer and widely available online. </p> <p>That incident illustrated the scale of the difficulty the family faced in controlling their image in a global media market where they were of huge international interest. It was not a British newspaper, for instance, but the US website The Drudge Report that revealed Prince Harry was serving in Afghanistan in 2008, forcing him to be urgently pulled out of Helmand. On that occasion, the British media had been aware of the deployment but <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2008/feb/28/military.afghanistan\">agreed to observe a strict media blackout</a>. </p> <p>Even if it is impossible to restrict every outlet, however, it is clear the family will do their best to control what they can. \u201c[Prince Harry] knows this is not a magic wand and this stuff will continue,\u201d a royal source said. \u201cBut he no longer felt comfortable in himself having so much written about someone not because of who she is, but because of who he is.\u201d</p>",

EU leaders met without David Cameron soon after the Brexit vote and held the summit in Slovakia without Theresa May in September.</p> <p>The meeting is a sign the EU27 are intensifying preparations on Britain\u2019s EU exit ahead of article 50, which May has promised to trigger by the end of March.</p> <p>Once the UK fires the starting gun on talks, the EU will spend four to eight weeks drawing up detailed guidelines for negotiations, a list of red lines that could cover everything from the single market to the status of Gibraltar.</p> <p>That work hasn\u2019t started yet, but Tusk wants to start preparing the ground.

He said: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>There are those who have deliberately chosen to misrepresent the facts to challenge the independence of the judiciary, one of the cornerstones of our democratic parliamentary system. The reporting of this judgment in some newspapers was frankly a disgrace and an insult to the good name of journalism.</p> <p>The democratic structure of the UK and indeed this assembly is built on a foundation of the rule of law and the independence of our judicial system. The tragic recent history of Europe is littered with examples of countries that overthrew the rule of law and undermined the independence of the courts. That road is not a democratic one and leads only in one direction. I would hope those who may have made comments and statements in haste, will want to reflect.</p> </blockquote> <p>Explaining to the assembly in Cardiff why he wants to appear in person at the supreme court hearing, Antoniw said: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I consider that this case raises issues of profound importance not only in relation to the concept of parliamentary sovereignty but also in relation to the wider constitutional arrangements of the United Kingdom and the legal framework for devolution.</p> <p>I think it is of paramount importance to emphasise at this point that despite the political furore surrounding it and the frankly alarming tone of much of the press coverage, as the high court itself said, this case involves a pure question of law. It is not concerned with the merits and demerits of leaving the European Union and the politics surrounding that.</p> <p>The sole legal question at issue is whether the UK Government can as a matter of constitutional law use the prerogative powers to give notice of withdrawal from the European Union. In seeking to intervene in any appeal, the Welsh government will seek to reinforce the importance of parliamentary sovereignty and the rule of law: core, established principles of British constitutional law.</p> </blockquote> <p>Antoniw emphasised that the Welsh government was not seeking to reverse the result of the referendum. He said: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Having outlined what the case is about I should also make a comment on what it is not about. The first minister has made crystal clear and I repeat that sentiment now: the Welsh government respects the result of the referendum and this is absolutely not about overturning that decision.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5821fae1e4b07ceadb3a39c3\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-11-08T16:23:28.701Z\">4.23pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The legal commentator <strong>Joshua Rozenberg </strong>has posted a good story <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/JoshuaRozenbergQC/posts/222545208167403\">on his Facebook page.</a> He says that Liz Truss, the lord chancellor and justice secretary, is being sued by six high court judges for age discrimination.

In contrast the other targets either had more thresholds that were more arbitrary (\u201cwhen did the cycle start and end?\u201d, \u201cwhy 40% of GDP?\u201d, \u201cwhy should debt definitely fall between two future points in time?\u201d, \u201cwhy should welfare spending definitely be below some fixed level?\u201d) and/or were not sufficiently flexible in the face of adverse fiscal shocks (\u201cwhy must there be an overall surplus in 2019\u201320?\u201d, \u201cwhy must borrowing in 2013\u201314 be no more than half what it was in 2009\u201310?\u201d). The weaknesses of these other targets often meant that their abandonment was preferable than trying slavishly to adhere to them. </p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5821f373e4b029b92ca46a93\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-11-08T15:56:12.758Z\">3.56pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here are some more pictures from Theresa May\u2019s India tour today.<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"09d176b3adef39ae79e585ec2987b24bec5ccc00\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/09d176b3adef39ae79e585ec2987b24bec5ccc00/0_94_3390_2035/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Theresa May stands amidst Hindu priests after offering prayers to the Hindu deity Lord Shiva during a visit to Someshwara Temple in Bangalore.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Theresa May stands amidst Hindu priests after offering prayers to the Hindu deity Lord Shiva during a visit to Someshwara Temple in Bangalore.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Manjunath Kiran/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"251caa6fb2448a24d14bdb9d5a5a440c5be45572\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/251caa6fb2448a24d14bdb9d5a5a440c5be45572/0_240_4716_2829/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Theresa May at the Sri Someshwara Temple.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Theresa May at the Sri Someshwara Temple.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dan Kitwood/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"218aad3cbba35767c27daa88731119c5ca0ceda1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/218aad3cbba35767c27daa88731119c5ca0ceda1/0_240_4507_2705/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Theresa May at the Sri Someshwara Temple.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Theresa May at the Sri Someshwara Temple.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dan Kitwood/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2a8fddb7a9257352c02f8eb4a75fbc86dcc47256\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2a8fddb7a9257352c02f8eb4a75fbc86dcc47256/0_0_3092_5184/596.jpg\" alt=\"Hindu priests brief British Prime Minister Theresa May, center, during her visit to Someshwara.\" width=\"596\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Hindu priests brief British Prime Minister Theresa May, center, during her visit to Someshwara.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Aijaz Rahi/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>And this is what Number 10 said about the visit in a briefing note sent out in advance.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The prime minister will visit the Sri Someshwara Temple in the Ulsoor District of Bengaluru later today to pay her respects at this ancient Hindu place of worship.</p> <p>She will be welcomed by a guard of honour consisting of garlanders (who place a garland of fragrant flowers around the neck) and musicians playing drums and horns. </p> <p>She will then tour the temple, built by the Chola dynasty (300 BCE\u20131279 CE) and showcasing an impressive mixture of Chola, Hoysala and Vijayanagar architecture.</p> <p>Someshwara means \u201che who wears the moon on his head\u201d, and is another name for Lord Shiva, one of the principal deities in the Hindu triumvirate.</p> <p>The prime minister will conclude her visit by participating in a Hindu Aarti (blessing).

So we should all give a lot of thought to that when you\u2019re talking to your friends and neighbours and trying to influence them. The first thing this election is about is how to restore broad-based prosperity and growth to the American economy. And I hope in the next presidential debate she and Senator Sanders and the others will be able to talk about what the best way to do that is. Hillary says that you have to have a campaign that appeals to the struggling, the striving and the successful. We have to do this together. And Bernie says just go get the money from the millionaires. And it sounds good because there\u2019s \u2013 to a lot of people, if you look all over the world \u2013 the British Labor Party disposed of its most (inaudible) leader, David Miliband, because they were mad at him for being part of Tony Blair\u2019s government in the Iraq War. And they moved to the left and put his brother in as leader because the British labor movement wanted it. When David Cameron thumped him in the election, they reached the interesting conclusion that they lost because they hadn\u2019t moved far left enough, and so they went out and practically got a guy off the street to be the leader of the British Labor Party, who I saw in the press today said that he was really a British citizen and had real British (inaudible). (Laughter.) </p> <p>But what that is reflective of \u2013 the same thing happened in the Greek election \u2013 when people feel they\u2019ve been shafted and they don\u2019t expect anything to happen anyway, they just want the maddest person in the room to represent them. And that is perfectly psychologically understandable and predictable. Most people in America haven\u2019t had a raise in 15 years. 86 percent of the American people, adjusted for inflation, have an income today lower than it was the day before the crash. The median income of American families, adjusted for inflation, is lower than it was the day I left office. </p> <p>So this election, first of all, should be: how do we restore broad-based prosperity? We\u2019ve only had one period in 50 years, since the early 1960s, when all segments of the American economy grew together, and that was the eight years when I served. You have to work at that. It is not an accident. That\u2019s a matter of policy. It really does matter what you do. And I\u2019m really proud of the fact that we moved 100 times as many people out of poverty into the middle class through work as happened in the Reagan years.

But building a plan for further austerity in the next parliament would be prudent. Indeed even if a balanced headline budget was delivered in 2020\u201321 and then maintained thereafter public sector net debt would not be on course to reach its pre-crisis level of 40% of national income until around the mid-2040s. Unfortunately if anything the \u00a325 billion estimated deterioration in the public finances in 2019\u201320 is likely to understate the increase in the longer-term challenge that has occurred since the March Budget. The OBR\u2019s previous long-run projections were based on an optimistic assumption about NHS productivity growth which they have recently said is likely to be revised down in their future projections. More fundamentally any reduction in future immigration, any reduction in longer-term growth or any increase in future interest rates would make the fiscal arithmetic harder still. </p> </blockquote> <p>This morning Nick Gibb, the education minister, and Lord O\u2019Donnell, the former cabinet secretary, are both giving evidence to select committees.

Attempts to come up with a test that is resistant to coaching have so far failed \u2013 and some claimed it had even made the situation worse, MPs were told.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/sep/12/tutor-11plus-test-grammar-schools-disadvantaged-pupils\">\u2018Tutor-proof\u2019 11-plus professor admits grammar school test doesn\u2019t work</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The government\u2019s chief scientific adviser, Tim Leunig, told the committee that a perfect, tutor-proof test did not yet exist. Buckinghamshire, which has an entirely selective school system, had attempted to come up one, but it had not worked, he said.<br></p> <p>There have been experiments elsewhere. In Birmingham in the King Edward VI family of schools, for example, there is a different pass mark for children from deprived backgrounds who are eligible for free school meals.</p> <p>Asked if he thought it was possible to come up with a completely tutor-proof test that would help level the playing field, Gibb said: \u201cThat would be the holy grail. That\u2019s something we are consulting on. We want to receive evidence from specialists in this area.\u201d </p> <p>Gibb and Leunig were giving evidence following an earlier session during which education experts including Rebecca Allen, director of the research organisation Education Datalab, and Anna Vignoles, professor of education at the University of Cambridge, outlined their concerns about the expansion of selective education.</p> <p>They told the committee they thought it would be extremely difficult to come up with a tutor-proof test. They also said evidence showed that poorer pupils were less likely to get into grammar schools, and that the secondary moderns that coexist with grammars not only lose their best pupils, but also struggle to recruit the best teachers, who are drawn to the selective schools.</p> <p>The minister refused to accept however that increased selection in the education system would lead to greater social segregation. Gibb said grammar schools would be required to help raise standards in neighbouring schools and would face sanctions if they failed to do so. He said the government wanted to introduce \u201cthe DNA\u201d of grammar schools into non-grammars, so that they would benefit from their expertise.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not about segregation,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not going back to the binary system of the 50s and 60s. We live in a quite different school system now. We don\u2019t have those secondary moderns, which provided very poor education, now.\u201d He said under the new system, the consequence of not going to a selective school was that a pupil would go to \u201cone of these very good comprehensives\u201d.</p> <p>Asked about international evidence on greater selection in education, Dr Leunig referred MPs to the Dutch system, whereby children are selected by academic ability at 12. The vast majority of children sit what is known as the <a href=\"http://www.cito.com/\">Cito</a> test and are then divided into different schools, ranging from highly academic to more technical.</p> <p>Leunig pointed out the Netherlands scored better in the 2012 international Pisa tests than the UK: in reading, the Netherlands was ranked 15th, compared with the UK at 23rd, and in maths, the Netherlands was in 10th place, with the UK in 26th. \u201cSelection is compatible with doing well,\u201d he said.</p> <p>The government is currently consulting on lifting Tony Blair\u2019s 1998 ban on new grammar schools in order, it claims, to improve <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/aug/08/do-grammar-schools-really-promote-social-mobility\">social mobility</a> and enable poorer students to get the best education. The debate is likely to continue until the government reports its findings next spring.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Labour is claiming that new analysis of data shows selective areas have some of the worst records for promoting social mobility and the widest gaps in attainment between disadvantaged pupils and their peers. The attainment gap is worse than the national average in eight out of nine fully selective areas for which data is available, while for partially selective areas the figures are 16 out of 26 areas, according to Labour.</p> <p>Lucy Powell MP, Labour\u2019s former shadow education secretary, said: \u201cThe evidence is clear: selective areas have some of the worst records for promoting social mobility and the widest gaps in attainment between disadvantaged pupils and their peers.\u201d<br></p>",

This unlikeliest of public servants began his political life as the anti-Obama candidate, seeking to ride the swinging pendulum away from a high point in racial equality and shifting into opposition to the equivalent moment in women\u2019s emancipation.</p> <p>It was a crowded field. Former Florida governor Jeb Bush was long seen as the Republican frontrunner and raised more money within weeks than his self-described billionaire opponent was ever to contribute to the presidential campaign. Yet Bush was to flop disastrously at the first brush with actual voters. His measly three delegates in the Republican primary election \u2013 0.2% of the total needed to secure the nomination \u2013 were to cost $50m a piece.

Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren was petitioned by many on the left and resisted. Sanders, an independent Vermont senator, stepped forward instead \u2013 at first with little hope of winning much beyond his home state, but determined there should at least be a debate about a more progressive alternative to the centrism traditionally associated with the Clinton family.</p> <p>The 74-year-old was to win 22 states and ride a tidal wave of enthusiasm rarely seen in politics. Fueled by anger over economic inequality and corruption, this gruff outsider came close several times to achieving enough momentum to pull off a victory that would have made Trump\u2019s nomination look tame. Like the reeling Republicans, the Democratic party too was convulsed by a wave of populism it first seemed ill-equipped to recognise, let alone respond to.</p> <p>Though a generation of young white supporters \u201cfelt the Bern\u201d, his campaign nonetheless never reached escape velocity. Quite apart from its shocking radicalism (at least by modern American standards), it was held back by a lack of early media coverage, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/mar/02/bernie-sanders-revolution-white-african-american-voters\">limited support among African American voters</a> in the south and determined resistance from the party hierarchy. Despite conspiracy theories to the contrary, Clinton was to win nationally by a clear and convincing majority.</p> <p>But the long, and sometimes bitter, Democratic primary showed its eventual nominee\u2019s vulnerabilities just as much as it also helped shift her manifesto to the left in ways even Sanders could once only dream of.

The highlights instead were the moments when it became apparent America had left the railing and was heading off into some entirely new and uncharted territory.</p> <p>Trump <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5tjPZvxwgEk\">first descended the golden escalator</a> of his Manhattan skyscraper into a flock of reporters hungry for excitement.

An excited press pack chased her across the plains of Iowa in a bus they dubbed the \u201cScooby van\u201d, only to discover a tightly disciplined campaign nothing like the cartoon playing on the other channel.</p> <p>Trump also immediately showed a remarkable gift for offending people. In the same first speech, Mexican immigrants were dismissed as \u201crapists\u201d, bringing nothing but drugs and crime to the US. Within minutes it was clear this would be a shockingly divisive campaign.</p> <p>But it was a weapon he would wield effectively against Republican opponents. Bush was taunted as \u201clow energy\u201d during a series of debates that played to Trump\u2019s strengths as a TV performer but brought the Grand Old Party down to the level of a schoolyard bully. </p> <p>By the time New Jersey governor Chris Christie joined in by destroying another promising rival, Marco Rubio, it was clear Trump had re-created the brutal dynamic of his reality TV franchise, The Apprentice.

You don\u2019t want to get any silly bookings early on and end up getting sent off because, in this type of game, you need all your men out on the pitch. Of course there will be tackles flying in and a lot of battles and duels, but that\u2019s what it is all about, so you have to keep a cool head but still have that passion. All we can do is fight as a team and talk to each other when needed to keep everyone going.</p> <p>\u201cWe can all feel the buzz around here [at St George\u2019s Park] and the media and how much it means to everyone. We want to go out there and win the game, that\u2019s all we can do. We want to make sure we send the fans home happy with a good result and, hopefully, a good performance as well. We\u2019re definitely up for the game and we can\u2019t wait. We have to use the atmosphere to our advantage. We have to use all the positive energy and that passion to win the game.</p> <p>\u201cWe had a meeting last night where the manager showed us a montage of previous games, and it\u2019s great to look back just to feel the importance of the game for everyone. We know what it means. Gareth obviously knows what it means after playing back at Euro 96 and we\u2019re looking forward to it. It isn\u2019t like another game where, if you lose, it doesn\u2019t matter and you don\u2019t hear about it too much. This one \u2026 we know the Scottish players, we have Scottish friends who will make it heard if they beat us, so we obviously don\u2019t want that and we\u2019ll do all we can to try to win.\u201d</p> <p>Kane, who returned after a seven-week absence with an ankle injury for Tottenham Hotspur\u2019s draw with Arsenal in the north London derby on Sunday, was one of nine players excused training at St George\u2019s Park on Tuesday, with Southgate not taking any chances on fitness. The striker\u2019s club-mates Kyle Walker, Danny Rose and Eric Dier all sat out the session, along with Jack Wilshere, Phil Jagielka, Raheem Sterling, Theo Walcott and John Stones. Numbers were boosted by the presence of Nathaniel Chalobah, James Ward-Prowse and Nathan Redmond, who stepped up from the under-21s.</p> <p>\u201cIt feels great to be back for Spurs and to be back with England is always special,\u201d added Kane. \u201cObviously I missed the last get-together with England [for the games against Malta and Slovenia], which was hard to take, but the ankle feels good now and it\u2019s great to be back in the fold. Playing on Sunday was perfect. I\u2019d been training leading up the Arsenal game and it was in the back of my mind that I wanted to be fit enough to be called up. I knew I had to be fit for the derby for that to be an option.</p> <p>\u201cI seem to do well in games against [close] rivals. England\u2019s no different. If I\u2019m picked to play on Friday I\u2019ll be going into that game full of passion and pride, and trying to win the game for our country. The manager knows this occasion, he\u2019s been there and done it, so any experience he can give us is vital. And he\u2019s done that.

Currently, the government provides each local authority with a dedicated schools grant (DSG). Each authority retains some of the grant for central educational spending, and distributes the rest to individual schools according to a locally-calculated formula, subject to certain restrictions. They can also top up the grants to schools from their wider budget. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The last thing you want to do is bring in a new national funding formula at a time of funding crisis</p> <footer> <cite>Valentine Mulholland, NAHT</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Under this system, some authorities receive more funding-per-pupil than others. Inner-city authorities are the biggest beneficiaries: the 10 best-funded areas in England are <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/educationnews/11473308/School-funding-is-a-postcode-lottery-head-teachers-warn.html\">all in London</a>, with the City of London topping the table at \u00a38,595 per pupil. Nottingham, Birmingham, Manchester and Liverpool all do well while the worst-funded are rural and suburban authorities such as Wokingham (which receives \u00a34,158 per pupil), Poole and South Gloucestershire.</p> <h2>Starting over</h2> <p>In March, the government opened a <a href=\"https://consult.education.gov.uk/funding-policy-unit/schools-national-funding-formula/supporting_documents/Schools_NFF_consultation.pdf\">consultation</a> [pdf] on a proposed new national funding formula. Under this formula, which aims to iron out the inequalities in the current system, the funding each pupil attracts to the school will be determined nationally. The formula will allocate funds according to a number of factors categorised under four broad headings, or \u201cbuilding blocks\u201d (basic per-pupil funding, additional needs, school costs, and geographic costs), but we don\u2019t know yet what weighting will be given to each factor. <br></p> <p>The original plan was to introduce the new formula in April 2017. The disruption caused by the change of government, however, led to a decision to delay implementation until April 2018. The government plans to respond to the first consultation, and launch a second consultation, this autumn.</p> <p>The National Association of Headteachers (NAHT) believes that funding reform is overdue, but has concerns about the timing and the potential impact on inner-city schools. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/teacher-network/2016/oct/05/why-school-funding-unfair\">Why is the school funding system so unfair? \u2013 explainer</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Valentine Mulholland, the NAHT\u2019s head of policy, says: \u201cThe last thing you want to do is bring in a new national funding formula at a time of funding crisis.\u201d Schools are already struggling with extra costs and will be hit again by the <a href=\"http://schoolsweek.co.uk/apprenticeships-how-the-levy-and-hiring-targets-will-affect-schools-and-multi-academy-trusts/\">apprenticeship levy</a> of 0.5% to be introduced in April 2017. </p> <p>An NAHT <a href=\"http://www.naht.org.uk/welcome/news-and-media/key-topics/funding/breaking-point/\">survey</a> last year found that half of headteachers have reduced the hours of teaching assistants, while nearly two-thirds are reducing investment in equipment. Secondary schools, Mulholland says, are \u201chaving to make really difficult decisions about whether they are going to offer drama, music and art GCSE, which are not part of the accountability regime.\u201d</p> <p>The government\u2019s proposals have been met with dismay by those authorities and schools likely to lose out under the new formula. Rob Hull, vice-chair of the Islington Schools Forum, has several concerns. Local authorities\u2019 rich local knowledge, enabling them to use discretion in the allocation of funds, can\u2019t be emulated by national government, he argues. Islington, for example, has been able to give extra funds to help schools deal with a sudden influx of migrant students: \u201cThat group at this time needed help, but it wouldn\u2019t be a long-term need \u2013 they\u2019d have learnt the language and know their way around.\u201d</p> <p>In the new model, a portion of the per-pupil funding will be allocated according to deprivation. A pupil\u2019s degree of deprivation will be determined partly by postcode. While this will work well in parts of the country, Hull says they make no sense in an area such as Islington, where rich owner-occupiers live next door to people in social housing.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Because living costs in the inner London boroughs are going up, it\u2019s harder and harder to recruit and retain teachers</p> <footer> <cite>Sue Macmillan, Hammersmith and Fulham council</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>He also argues that, when it comes to extra funding for deprived pupils, the government may underestimate the effects of \u201cconcentrated deprivation\u201d, such as a higher number of pupils with English as an Additional Language (EAL). </p> <p>\u201cWhen you\u2019ve got one child in a class from a deprived background, that child, through being with its peers, can cope better and needs less support than if you\u2019ve got a majority of such children in the classroom.\u201d</p> <p>There are concerns that the dramatic improvement in London schools\u2019 results in the past 15 years could be reversed if funding is cut. Sue Macmillan, cabinet member for children and education on Hammersmith and Fulham council, argues that it makes more sense to \u201clevel up the rest of the country than bring London down\u201d.</p> <p>In Hammersmith and Fulham, says Macmillan, heads are already making efficiency savings by collaborating with other schools, and some are expecting to cut staff numbers. In the meantime, they are also struggling with recruitment as the rising costs in the capital drive teachers away. </p> <p>Other inner-city authorities also face cuts. Councillor Nick Small, assistant mayor for education, employment and skills in Liverpool, says that modelling by the council shows the worst-case scenario is a <a href=\"http://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/liverpool-news/george-osbornes-20m-raid-liverpool-11657591\">cut of \u00a320m</a>. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/teacher-network/2016/nov/03/are-englands-teachers-being-paid-enough\">Are England's teachers being paid enough?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>He says: \u201cOur schools are run really efficiently.

School budgets are currently protected by a minimum funding guarantee, which means that no school will lose more than 1.5% funding per pupil in a single year. The government has said the guarantee will continue, but not whether it will remain at 1.5%. </p> <p>This lack of clarity is making it hard for schools to plan ahead, says Natalie Perera, executive director of the thinktank CentreForum. She says: \u201cIf schools know what their end budget will be and how quickly they will lose that money, they will be able to plan for the redundancies they make, if any, and in the case of a secondary school whether they need to drop a subject or a department; but without knowing that, it becomes really difficult.\u201d</p> <p>It means that heads are operating in the dark, to some extent. Sarah Holmes-Carne, headteacher of Kenton School in Newcastle, says she is planning for the worst-case scenario. \u201cBecause Kenton is part of a multi-academy trust, our mantra is if a member of staff leaves we think once, twice, three times about replacing them,\u201d she says. </p> <p>Members of a multi-academy trust are able to share staff in key subject areas, as well as HR and finance, but Holmes-Carne is reluctant to employ staff on short-term contracts because of the potential impact on learning. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/teacher-network/2016/oct/13/schools-new-sources-funding-parents-donations\">Plugging the gap: schools forced to find new sources of funding</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Haylock says he may have to consider a narrower curriculum offer and reducing the number of cultural activities. \u201cIt\u2019s about modelling and looking at your capabilities, your student numbers, your staffing \u2013 not looking necessarily to make redundancies but to make savings where people have left and you can look to deploy their roles in a different way,\u201d he says.</p> <p>Sam White, head of William Ellis school in Camden, has always kept within budget and has even managed a surplus most years, but he\u2019s concerned about the impact of the changes on top of the extra costs he already faces. </p> <p>He said: \u201cI\u2019ve carried out three small reorganisations in the school in five years to try to make us more efficient, we\u2019ve got 10 fewer teachers than we had in 2011 and the senior staff is a fraction of the size it was before.\u201d</p> <p>White finds himself in a difficult position. His school has 125 in each year group, currently split into five classes. One option is to increase intake, but in the school\u2019s small classrooms, more than 25 children becomes a squeeze. His perception is that financial pressures are forcing families to move out of inner London into outer London, which would make it harder to attract a bigger intake. Currently, he says, morale at the school is good, and he is reluctant to do anything that will impact that, although he has made a small number of redundancies and almost all his new hires this year are on temporary one-year contracts. </p> <p>The government has pledged to open the second consultation this autumn. The concern among London heads and councils is that the dramatic improvement in results in the city will go into reverse if the new formula is applied. </p> <p>\u201cYou are going to be in a situation where you take away money from students that need it the most,\u201d said Haylock. \u201cAnd that shouldn\u2019t be the way you\u2019re running your education system.\u201d <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p><strong>Follow us on Twitter via <a href=\"https://twitter.com/GuardianTeach\">@GuardianTeach</a>.

One simple and effective improvement would be ending no-fault notice and eviction.</p> <p>Tenants must not be given notice without an excellent reason \u2013 one taken from a list of statutory acceptable reasons, such as the need for the owner to live in it themselves (unless it\u2019s a buy-to-let mortgage). This must be properly policed and funded, so naughty rentiers can\u2019t sneakily repossess and relet property. This will happen in Scotland later next year under new legislation, so no more \u201cjust in case notices\u201d as landlords go fishing for new tenants who might pay higher rent (and the occupying tenant gets to stay if they pay up).</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/28/homelessness-housing-bob-blackman-bill\">Homelessness can only really be tackled if people have somewhere to go | Poppy Noor</a> </p> </aside>  <p>I would also suggest a new policy of no evictions in winter, <a href=\"http://www.thelocal.fr/20161102/housing-what-exactly-is-frances-winter-truce\" title=\"\">as enacted in France</a>, after a woman, evicted and consequently roofless, froze to death on the streets.</p> <p>Finally, in the spirit of what\u2019s sauce for the social housing goose, bring in right to buy for the private rented sector\u2019s gander.

  "<p>My father, Robert Clement, who has died aged 84, educated and supported art teachers and wrote the popular textbook The Art Teacher\u2019s Handbook (1986).</p> <p>Bob thought art education should give children the skills to respond with confidence to their individual view of themselves and their world. He thought it vital for teachers to have a rich and intriguing collection of source materials in their classrooms and believed that everyone can draw, citing one eight-year-old who, when asked how he made a drawing, replied, \u201cI think, and then I draw a line round my think.\u201d</p> <p>He studied as an artist and art teacher at the Bath Academy of Art in Corsham from 1956 to 1959, under its principal Clifford Ellis, who had been taught by Sickert, a protege of Degas, a link of which he was proud, although the main influences on his art were the landscapes of Paul Nash, Eric Ravilious and Graham Sutherland.</p> <p>Bob was born in Erdington, Birmingham, the son of Arthur, a sales clerk at Dunlop who trained at night school to become a chief engineer at the factory, and his wife, Rose (nee Mallen), a cook and housekeeper. At 13, operations for mastoiditis left Bob partially deaf. After outpatient check-ups, instead of returning to class at King Edward VI school, Aston, he would go to Birmingham Museum and Art Gallery, where he particularly liked Millais\u2019s The Blind Girl. So began his love of art.</p> <p>Combining this with his passion for theatre, he trained as a theatre designer at Birmingham School of Art. For four years he designed and painted scenery at the Criterion theatre in the city, and in Weston-super-Mare, where he met and married Brenda Jennison. The set design he was most proud of was for Capek\u2019s The Insect Play.</p> <p>In 1955, having seen provincial theatres, hit by television, playing safe with comedies and thrillers, he abandoned the design of \u201cendless living rooms\u201d and went to teach at secondary schools in Sittingbourne, Kent (1959-60), then at Bideford in Devon (1961-66). Bob would borrow a neighbour\u2019s chickens and pigeons to \u201csit\u201d for the pupils.</p> <p>Hoping to help more children explore art by training their teachers, he lectured at Loughborough College of Education (1966-70), and was art adviser to Devon schools from 1970 until his retirement in 1992, when he became visiting professor at the University of Plymouth. He was appointed OBE for his work in art curriculum development.</p> <p>He was chair of the Schools Council Art Committee (1978-83) and president of the National Society for Education in Art and Design (1985). He wrote several books and revised The Art Teacher\u2019s Handbook to include new media.</p> <p>His marriage to Brenda ended amicably in 1975, and in 1978 Bob met Jane Carruthers Kay, through a colleague. They settled in Topsham, Devon, and married in 2003. His later paintings were mostly of Dartmoor, where he and Jane spent every summer in an old caravan next to the river Swincombe, where they loved to swim. He also enjoyed exhibitions and theatre, and was dancing to the Rolling Stones at a party two months before he died.</p> <p>He is survived by Jane, by his children, Matthew, Rachel and me, his step-sons, Richard, Michael, Charles and James, by three grandsons and eight step-grandchildren, and by his brother David.</p>",

This does not amount to Holyrood having a veto on triggering article 50.</p> <p>Sturgeon said that, regardless of the legal outcome, politically she believed there should be a legislative consent motion before Holyrood. \u201cIt strikes right at the heart of the devolution settlement. I believe as a matter of politics, of fairness and respect to the devolution settlement, it is inconceivable that the UK government would try to ignore the opinion of the Scottish government.</p> <p>\u201cIt would be disrespecting the whole devolution settlement and the place that that convention has always had in the devolution settlement for a decision of this magnitude and with this degree of impact on our devolved responsibilities to be taken without the Scottish parliament being consulted.\u201d</p> <p>She said she believed members of both the Welsh and Northern Irish governments would take similar views of their own parliaments. </p> <p>\u201cThe Scottish government is clear that triggering article 50 will directly affect devolved interests and rights in Scotland,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd triggering article 50 will inevitably deprive Scottish people and Scottish businesses of rights and freedoms which they currently enjoy.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>\u201cIt simply cannot be right that those rights can be removed by the UK government on the say-so of a prime minister without parliamentary debate, scrutiny or consent. So legislation should be required at Westminster and the consent of the Scottish parliament should be sought before article 50 is triggered.\u201d</p> <p>The SNP leader said the lord advocate \u2013 Scotland\u2019s most senior law officer \u2013 would lodge the application as soon as the UK government lodged its own appeal. Having been granted leave to intervene, she said, the lord advocate would then set out the relevant legal arguments. The Scottish government had legal counsel attending the previous article 50 hearing throughout as an observer.</p> <p>Sturgeon said the intervention was \u201cnot an attempt to frustrate the will of the people of England and Wales. But it is part of our overall attempt to protect the will of the Scottish people. My priority is to seek to protect Scotland\u2019s interests and part of that is to protect the voice of the Scottish parliament.\u201d</p> <p>She added: \u201cLet me be clear: I recognise and respect the right of England and Wales to leave the European Union. But the democratic wishes of the people of Scotland and the national parliament of Scotland cannot be brushed aside as if they do not matter.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>\u201cThe prime minister said that on 23 June people across the UK had voted with, in her words, \u2018emphatic clarity\u2019 when they voted by a margin of four points to leave the EU. The margin for remain in Scotland was 24 points: a far more emphatic and clear result.</p> <p> \u201cSo the prime minister needs to live up to her promise to treat Scotland as an equal partner in the United Kingdom and listen to the will of the people of Scotland.\u201d</p> <p>Asked about the shadow Brexit secretary <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/nov/07/keir-starmer-labour-will-not-block-article-50-but-must-know-plan\">Keir Starmer\u2019s Guardian article</a> on Monday in which he said Labour MPs would not vote to block article 50 in the Commons, Sturgeon said she remained hopeful that there was potential to build a coalition in Westminster against a hard Brexit.</p> <p>She said: \u201cIn fairness to him, to everybody, we don\u2019t yet know what the precise terms of a vote on article 50 would look like.

But the multiple offences \u2013 of being a woman, of colour, attractive, and most infuriatingly of all, of refusing to be downtrodden \u2013 meant it was inevitable that Miller\u2019s principled campaign, even if you don\u2019t agree with her, was collapsed into the view that she was <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/2096699/sister-of-prince-harrys-new-flame-warns-meghan-markle-is-a-diva-with-soft-spot-for-gingers-who-is-not-fit-to-be-a-royal/\">an uppity social climber</a> who had somehow inveigled her way into a position of power.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/nov/04/gina-miller-brexit-victory-triumph-democracy-over-politics\">As Gina Miller\u2019s lawyers, we fought and won a victory for democracy | Emily Nicholson and Katy Colton</a> </p> </aside>  <p>At Miller the dog whistles screeched, \u201cforeign born\u201d, \u201cthrice married\u201d, \u201cex-model\u201d, \u201cprivately educated\u201d.

  "<p>A study of teenagers in California has tentatively suggested a link between vaping and starting to smoke cigarettes, although experts say it does not prove that one leads to the other.</p> <p>About 37% of teens in the US have tried vaping, and there is widespread anxiety that young people who use e-cigarettes may be more likely to start smoking as a result. </p> <p>The study, published in the <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama\">Journal of the American Medical Association</a> (JAMA), looked at vaping and smoking in more than 3,000 teenagers, aged about 15, in the 10th grade of 10 public high schools in Los Angeles county, California.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>The numbers who vaped or smoked at all were small \u2013 only 26 who had never smoked at the beginning of the study said at the end of the follow-up period, six months later, that they had used e-cigarettes and also smoked in the previous month. Others had previously smoked infrequently or frequently.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>But the researchers did find a trend. The more the teenagers said they had vaped, the more likely they were to smoke cigarettes. The more frequent vapers were also likely to smoke more heavily.</p> <p>The public health community is divided over the pros and cons of e-cigarettes. Some doctors believe they may be the <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/sep/13/electronic-cigarettes-can-help-smokers-quit-says-study\">best tool yet for helping established smokers quit the habit</a>, but others are less convinced and warn they could be a means of hooking non-smokers into a tobacco habit.</p> <p>The authors of the study \u2013 Adam Leventhal, of the University of Southern California Keck School of Medicine, and colleagues \u2013 acknowledge there are many unknowns but conclude that: \u201cThe transition from vaping to smoking may warrant particular attention in tobacco control policy.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/sifting-the-evidence/2016/sep/14/why-cant-scientists-agree-on-e-cigarettes-vaping\">Why can't scientists agree on e-cigarettes?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Other experts said although the study was well conducted, it could not explain the link. \u201cThis study could not tell us if it is something about the young people that vape that predisposes them to smoking or that vaping itself makes smoking more likely,\u201d said Paul Aveyard, professor of behavioural medicine at the University of Oxford. It was well known that teenagers who tried one risky behaviour were more likely to be willing to try another.</p> <p>\u201cSmoking in young people has fallen in the UK and the US to record lows in the past few years, despite the rise in prevalence of young people experimenting with e-cigarettes,\u201d he said. </p> <p>\u201cVery few young people who do not smoke cigarettes become regular users of e-cigarettes. In this context, we should not worry unduly about this study\u2019s findings, but it is important to monitor smoking in young people and its relationship with e-cigarette use.\u201d</p> <p>Prof John Britton, director of the UK centre for tobacco and alcohol studies at the University of Nottingham, said the study \u201cdoesn\u2019t tell us whether vaping caused these young people to start smoking, or whether they would have started smoking anyway; or whether vaping prevented some young people who would otherwise have become smokers from progressing to tobacco smoking.\u201d</p> <p>Children whose parents were smokers and trying to give up would be more likely to have access to e-cigarettes \u2013 and also more at risk of starting to smoke in the first place. \u201cThe key question is whether vaping is increasing smoking uptake, over and above that underlying risk,\u201d said Britton. \u201cThis study doesn\u2019t answer that question; but it does show that if it does, the proportions of children affected are very small.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>My father, Bill Ogilvie, who has died aged 87, was a senior social welfare officer for the Coal Industry Social Welfare Organisation until his retirement in 1989. He worked with miners who were disabled, or approaching retirement, liaising with rehabilitation centres and retirement homes and organising brass band, art and football competitions. He also led a full life, contributing much to his community.</p> <p>Born into a mining family in Ashington, Northumberland, the son of Nora Ogilvie (nee Robinson) and Tom Ogilvie, he left Park secondary school. He completed national service in Ceylon (now Sri Lanka) and on returning home met Connie, also from Ashington, whom he married in 1955.</p> <p>Away from work he took on roles including athletics coaching, becoming a founding member of Wansbeck Citizens Advice Bureau, sitting on the selection committee for magistrates, being a school governor, and working for the National Playing Fields Association. He was twice captain of Newbiggin Golf Club (later becoming president) and was chairman of Bomarsund Cricket Club, where he also coached junior cricketers. After Connie died in 2010 he continued to take on new responsibilities, including becoming a parish councillor.</p> <p>One of Bill\u2019s proudest moments was being nominated to run with the Olympic torch in June 2012. In 2013 he was appointed MBE for services to sport and the community in south-east Northumberland. He was thrilled at being given his MBE by Prince William, but the biggest smile he had that day was as he left Buckingham Palace and his eye was caught by a little boy standing with his parents watching what was going on. When asked by the mother what he had been in the palace for, he whipped the MBE box out of his pocket, let the boy hold it in his hand, making sure he got lots of photographs taken with the palace in the background. Bill got more of a thrill from pleasing others than anything else.</p> <p>He is survived by his daughters, Helen, Alison and me, and grandchildren Hannah, Matthew, Joe and Eve.</p>",

She arrived at the station, inside an elementary school, with husband Bill Clinton just under four hours after landing in Westchester from a final day of campaigning with four rallies across three battlegrounds.</p> \n<p>Dozens of supporters had braved a chilly fall morning to greet the candidate they hoped would be the first woman to serve in the nation\u2019s highest office.

She taped a series of radio interviews, and prepared for the night that will seal her fate from her home with a small group of confidantes. Clinton was set to watch the returns from The Peninsula, a luxury hotel that, incidentally, sits a block from Trump Tower on Manhattan\u2019s Fifth Avenue. The mood within the campaign was cautiously optimistic, with few signs of a team bracing for the unexpected.</p> \n<p>New, but untested, <a href=\"http://www.slate.com/votecastr_election_day_turnout_tracker.html?live=true\">projections of real time voting patterns</a> also appeared to support the Democratic party\u2019s belief that its voters were flocking to the polls, helping rally US stock markets for a second day running. But the Trump campaign reads the turnout signals in a different way, pointing out that the numbers of registered Republicans turning out to vote in battleground states were up on the level seen by Mitt Romney in 2012, while Democrats were seeing smaller turnout than for Obama.</p> \n<p>Some residents of Manhattan\u2019s Upper West Side cast their vote in Trump Place, a residential development built by the Republican nominee in the 1990s.

Indeed, it\u2019s now starting to overtake long political rants as the thing you\u2019re probably seeing most of on your social media feed. The trend apparently <a href=\"https://twitter.com/thvtmelanin_/status/791414169329369088\">started</a> with high school kids who may have taken their teacher\u2019s supplications to \u2018please, can you all just sit still\u2019 a little too literally. It infiltrated the adult world over the weekend; the hashtag #mannequinchallenge has been mentioned <a href=\"http://time.com/4562272/hillary-clinton-mannequin-challenge/\">2.3m times</a> in the past week on Twitter. <a href=\"http://people.com/celebrity/destinys-child-adele-mannequin-challenge/\">Everyone</a> from Adele to Ellen DeGeneres the New York Giants has given it a go. Destiny\u2019s Child even briefly reunited briefly to film their take. And Hillary Clinton\u2019s team <a href=\"https://twitter.com/HillaryClinton/status/795955854059171840\">got in on the (non)action</a> Tuesday morning.</p> <p>So what exactly is the Mannequin Challenge? The clue is in the name. A group of people freeze in mid-action like mannequins while someone goes around filming them. The only thing moving in the shot should be the camera. Then you put a soundtrack on it, stick it online, and watch the likes rack up. Black Beatles by Rae Sremmurd is one of the more popular options for soundtracks. It\u2019s a perfect song for the challenge because there\u2019s a quiet build up and then, around 25 seconds in, the beat drops and \u2026 nothing happens.</p> <p>You see, normally when the beat drops in a video meme, things happen. In the Harlem Shake it\u2019s the moment where everyone starts dancing. But with the Mannequin Challenge, the song gets going and everyone stays resolutely in position. It\u2019s, like, we\u2019re all going to stand this one out, OK? We\u2019re exhausted. Let\u2019s see about dancing next year.</p> <p>In a sense, the Mannequin Challenge is not actually that new; it\u2019s just a digital reboot of a craze from the 19th century for tableau vivant. Otherwise known as \u2018living pictures\u2019, these were used to dramatize important moments of history or famous paintings. They were also a bit of after-dinner fun. People used to hang around in their parlors after dinner and recreate famous scenes. To younger readers: yes, that is what life was like before the internet. It was rough.</p> <p>But while it may date back to the 19th century, the Mannequin Challenge is also very much of the moment. The fact that just being quiet and still for a moment has been so enthusiastically embraced by everyone from high schoolers to imminent presidents is a sign, I feel, that we are all very, very tired, and we would like a little rest, please.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/nov/08/trauma-presidential-election-2016-turning-point\">What can we salvage from the trauma of the US presidential election? | Lucia Graves</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The Mannequin Challenge isn\u2019t the only indicator of a need for less speed in an always-on, always-moving world. In August, Netflix started to air slow TV. Something of a cultural phenomenon in Norway, slow TV is basically a genre where nothing happens for hours on end. The first installment, a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z7VYVjR_nwE\">7.5-hour train ride</a> from Bergen to Oslo, was watched by around 45% of Norway\u2019s population.</p> <p>Just to reiterate, absolutely nothing happens on this train ride. There\u2019s no background music or narrative. It\u2019s just train sounds. Oh, and there are several tunnels, so the screen often just goes dark. This quiet hit was followed by other instant classics such as National Knitting Morning, National Knitting Evening, and National Knitting Night (my favorite of the trilogy). That Netflix US has recently picked up Slow TV might be a sign it thinks that Americans may well be in need of a little audiovisual Xanax.</p> <p>And then, of course, there\u2019s the growing popularity of mindfulness, which has gone mainstream in the last couple of years. In a world where being busy is the ultimate badge of honor, corporatized mindfulness allows you to take some time out in a socially approved way. You\u2019re not just sitting around doing nothing, you\u2019re not taking a break, you\u2019re being <em>mindful.</em></p> <p>When there\u2019s constant pressure to be achieving, and doing, and ticking off boxes, and racking up likes, it\u2019s worth remembering that there\u2019s nothing wrong with doing nothing now and again. We shouldn\u2019t need Slow TV or mindfulness apps or Mannequin Challenges to give us an excuse to just sit quietly. </p> <p>Still, here\u2019s hoping the Mannequin Challenge ushers in a new era of Slow Viral Memes. Maybe a Putting on the Kettle For a Nice Cup of Tea Challenge? Or a Just Having a Quick Nap Challenge? Of course, depending on how the presidential election turns out, the next viral trend may well be emigrating en masse to Canada.</p>",

With <a href=\"http://www.prisonstudies.org/country/united-kingdom-england-wales\">around 3,900, mainly vulnerable, women locked up in English jails</a> and 19 deaths already recorded this year (the highest for 12 years), the reforms can\u2019t come too soon, say campaigners.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/nov/03/liz-truss-prison-officers-prisons-staff-prisoner\">Liz Truss\u2019s \u00a39-per-hour prison officers won\u2019t produce safe, humane prisons | John Podmore</a> </p> </aside>  <p>For inspiration on how to deliver her vision, Truss need not travel far. On a recent visit to Scotland, I caught a glimpse of how a modern, progressive country should be treating women who break the law.</p> <p>When Scotland\u2019s justice minister, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/jun/30/michael-gove-scotland-prison-closure\">Michael Matheson, took office in 2014</a>, he announced plans to build a new prison to hold just 80 women deemed too dangerous for freedom, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/jun/30/michael-gove-scotland-prison-closure\">five small regional units, where most women offenders would be offered help with drugs, alcohol, domestic abuse and mental health problems</a>.</p> <p>Cornton Vale women\u2019s prison, in Stirling, is due for demolition in 2020 under Matheson\u2019s plans to make way for the new secure unit. In the meantime, it is pioneering a new approach to women in custody that will continue in the new facility.</p> <p>The first thing to notice as I begin an informal tour with the prison governor, <a href=\"http://scottishjusticematters.com/wp-content/uploads/Pages-from-SJM_3-2_June2015_Week-in-the-Life-Prison-Governor.pdf\">Rhona Hotchkiss</a>, is the silence. We are in Ross House, the smaller of the two existing units, holding around 20 prisoners \u2013 a mixture of new receptions and those, Hotchkiss says, with \u201cchallenging behaviour\u201d. Reception blocks and those housing prisoners with behavioural issues usually teem with noise; keys jangling, doors banging, staff bellowing orders and women venting their frustrations. But silence mostly reigns, apart from the hum of chatter from the prisoners, none of them locked in their cells. It is not accidental; staff at Cornton Vale operate under a \u201cno shouting\u201d rule (a first, for this prison watcher). And it appears the prisoners reciprocate.</p> <p>Then, something happens which, in most prisons, would be regarded as an \u201cincident\u201d. A prisoner approaches Hotchkiss and grabs her by the arm. Clearly agitated, the woman speaks rapidly. The governor listens intently, then replies in quiet tones. Clearly calming down, the woman releases her hold. Hotchkiss then places her hand on the woman\u2019s arm before moving on. Out of earshot, I ask Hotchkiss if the woman taking hold of her had been an issue? \u201cNo,\u201d she replies, \u201cshe\u2019s a vulnerable young woman, we need to engage.\u201d The woman \u2013 and every other prisoner we encountered \u2013 called the governor by her first name.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ccc369add9b6e4b509e1d56287d1ffcae6f52218\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ccc369add9b6e4b509e1d56287d1ffcae6f52218/125_89_5443_3266/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Paws for Progress \u2013 a scheme that \u2018works\u2019 at Polmont prison.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Paws for Progress \u2013 a scheme that \u2018works\u2019 at Polmont prison.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Murdo Macleod/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Peebles House, the second of the two remaining units at Cornton Vale, is even quieter, even though the women were also unlocked, as they are from morning until 9pm, barring an hour at lunchtime. It has corridors, and rooms, all carpeted. The accent is squarely on the wellbeing of the women. Hotchkiss says that 70% of the women suffer mental health problems, and only 20% have received mental health care in the community. Self-harm is an issue, with 15 incidents in a month recorded recently, but all were carried out by just three women.</p> <p>\u201cMary\u201d, serving a long sentence for violence, tells me she feels safe in Cornton and the programmes she is on make her feel confident about the future. \u201cThe staff care,\u201d she says. \u201cThere is no sense of them and us.\u201d Hotchkiss says the various programmes are all based on trauma reduction and education. \u201cWe need to know what works, and why. It\u2019s a hugely exciting time to be working in prisons,\u201d she adds.</p> <p>I see women making greeting cards to send to friends and relatives. It is popular, but poignantly Hotchkiss talks of a 19-year-old prisoner who didn\u2019t want to take part. When asked why, she said she had \u201cnobody outside to send a card to\u201d. Two days a week, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2013/sep/17/how-dogs-teaching-young-offenders\">PAT (pets as therapy) dogs</a> come into the prison \u2013 it\u2019s one of the schemes that \u201cworks\u201d says Hotchkiss.</p> <p>This summer, around 80 women were transferred from Cornton Vale to a part of Polmont young offenders institution (YOI) in Falkirk, some 20 miles away. Space was available at Polmont because Scotland\u2019s YOI population has reduced significantly in recent years. Here too, the focus is on women\u2019s health and education.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Just the way staff speak to you, get to know you. I feel comfortable telling them things \u2013 and that's a good feeling</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Susan Brookes has governed Polmont for four years. The women learn in small, individual-based programmes. It might be citizenship, parenting or grief and loss. Brookes says the number of women and young offenders who have suffered multiple bereavements is high. Staff work in partnership with outside agencies, aiming for a better understanding of women\u2019s routes into \u2013 and out of \u2013 offending. Staff and teachers say many women and young prisoners share traumatic histories. Officer Michael Wilson oversees a hi-tech media centre at Polmont, where prisoners operate a prison radio station which broadcasts around the clock. He says the women and young men often present with similar problems, all related to troubled backgrounds. \u201cEvery prisoner has their own problems; it\u2019s a challenge, but a rewarding one,\u201d he says.</p> <p>\u201cAmy\u201d is several years into a life sentence. She\u2019s in no doubt that change is afoot. \u201cI see it all the time \u2026 just the way staff speak to you, get to know you. It was never like this before. Now I feel more comfortable telling them things and that\u2019s a good feeling,\u201d she says.</p> <p>Blair House, which holds Polmont\u2019s women, is very much a prison wing, albeit much brighter than most. The cells here are also unlocked all day and women come and go at will within its confines. There is a well equipped gym, running and rowing machines and weight pulleys. Brookes says the \u201cfundamentals\u201d of her job are good relationships between staff and prisoners, with staff properly trained and responsive. Prison governors in Scotland are lucky: there have been no staff cuts here, as have happened in English and Welsh prisons. In fact, Polmont, with 375 staff for 533 prisoners, exceeds its staffing levels. (Portland prison, Dorset, with an almost identical roll call, has 255 staff.)</p> <p>It is too soon, however, to assess the impact of Scotland\u2019s reforms on women\u2019s reoffending rates. The latest figures, up to 2014, show around <a href=\"http://www.gov.scot/Publications/2015/10/7805/4\">45% of women leaving custody in Scotland are reconvicted within a year</a> <a href=\"http://www.prisonreformtrust.org.uk/Publications/Factfile\">compared to 48% in England</a>. (There are no women\u2019s prisons in Wales.)</p> <p>In 2015, <a href=\"http://www.gov.scot/Publications/2015/10/7805/4\">women made up more than 5% of the Scottish prison population, the second highest female prison population in northern Europe </a>and second only to Spain. Matheson describes the figures as \u201ctotally unacceptable\u201d, and says that \u201chousing women in smaller community-based units, closer to their families and alongside support services\u201d helps them with drug, alcohol and mental health issues. \u201cIt means we can stop them committing further crimes.\u201d</p> <p>Although the five new units will be run by prison staff, they will be broadly based on an existing residential centre, operated jointly by the charity Turning Point and Glasgow Addiction Services. Simply called <a href=\"http://www.turningpointscotland.com/what-we-do/criminal-justice/218-service/\">218</a>, the 12-bed residential unit occupies a handsome city-centre building in Glasgow that is identifiable only by building number.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"10dfd1db662aef2031d63a6b43ea329597bdd97e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/10dfd1db662aef2031d63a6b43ea329597bdd97e/89_161_5577_3346/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A residents\u2019 timetable at 218 in Glasgow\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A residents\u2019 timetable at 218 in Glasgow</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Murdo Macleod/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It mainly takes women referred by local courts and social services and accepted after an assessment process, looking at individual needs. The residential service provides supported accommodation for women from between four weeks and six months, and also runs day groups for non-residents. Many of their service users are subject to statutory supervision and have a range of complex needs, including substance misuse, mental and physical health problems, issues relating to domestic abuse, trauma, housing problems, or patterns of repeat offending.</p> <p>It opened in 2003, with the objective of reducing the number of women from the Glasgow area being remanded in custody and/or receiving a custodial sentence. Traditionally, Glasgow has always provided a large slice of Scotland\u2019s jail population, both male and female. But a two-year <a href=\"http://www.turningpointscotland.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/218-evaluation.pdf\">evaluation study</a>, carried out between 2007 and 2009, showed the percentage of female prisoners hailing from Glasgow had been cut from 33% to 13%. And while the total number of Scotland\u2019s female prisoners had more than doubled during that period, Glaswegian numbers fell by a quarter. The same study showed that reoffending figures for women referred to 218 between 2007-09 were reduced by 21%.</p> <p>At the unit, each woman is assigned a key worker and, according to their needs, access to an impressive range of physical and mental health facilities. Alternative therapies such as acupuncture and Indian head massage sit alongside dental and physical health, psychological/psychiatric services and detoxification. There are 12 full-time staff, including managers and two full-time nurses. The women live in bright, single rooms, wear name tags and carry fob passes indistinguishable from those carried by staff. Margaret Nkembou, the service coordinator, says \u201cbrew and blether\u201d sessions, where women relax and talk over their issues are an important part of the programmes.</p> <p>\u201cKelly\u201d, a former resident, is now a key worker at 218. She is one of three staff who have made the transition from offender to practitioner. Kelly says her understanding of the issues facing her charges is important. \u201cI have been where they are,\u201d she says. \u201cIt gives me a connection.\u201d She says her work continues to assist her own recovery. Kelly has served 12 years in jail, over several sentences, but calls them \u201cwasted years\u201d. \u201cThere was no rehabilitation. Being on the 218 programme made me feel part of the process, and allowed me to make positive decisions about my future,\u201d she says.</p> <p>From April 2015 to March 2016, of the 173 women who signed up with 218, just nine failed to complete their programmes. Nkembou points out that many of the women have a history of not engaging with agencies, so to start and complete a programme is a hugely positive step. The staff keep in contact with all their former service users; \u201cgraduation days\u201d, when women collect their certificates, are always well attended. \u201cThere are wonderful moments when a woman says she can\u2019t attend because she\u2019s working!\u201d says Nkembou.</p> <p>Prison reformers believe most of the solutions to women\u2019s offending do not lie behind prison walls. \u201cThere are still too may women being sent to prison for minor offences, including on remand and for short sentences,\u201d says Yvonne Donald, Scotland and Northern Ireland manager for the <a href=\"http://www.prisonreformtrust.org.uk/\">Prison Reform Trust</a>.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/nov/07/liz-truss-prisoners-rioting-bedford-prison-riot\">Dear Liz Truss \u2013 please consider why prisoners are rioting | Archie Bland</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Yet a decade after the <a href=\"http://www.justice.gov.uk/publications/docs/corston-report-march-2007.pdf\">Corston report on women in the criminal justice system</a> recommended a fundamental rethink about locking up women and instead providing support in the community, many of these reforms are finally being enacted in Scotland, giving the English justice secretary an example close to home that she would do well to follow.</p> <p>As Donald says: \u201cThe Scottish government\u2019s reforms are heading very much in the right direction.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 10 November 2016 to correct the distance from Cornton Vale to Polmont YOI.</p>",
  "<p>Impartiality lies at the very heart of good journalism \u2013 avoiding bias is something on which respectable media outlets pride themselves. This is laudable, as robust debate is vital for a healthy media and, by extension, an informed society. But when the weight of scientific evidence points incontrovertibly one direction, doggedly reporting both \u201csides\u201d equally can result in misleading coverage.</p> <p>The BBC provided a high-profile example of this in 2011, coming in for harsh criticism in <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://downloads.bbc.co.uk/bbctrust/assets/files/pdf/our_work/science_impartiality/science_impartiality.pdf\">a Trust report</a> which singled out their \u201cundue attention to marginal opinion\u201d<em tabindex=\"-1\"> </em> on the subject of man made climate change, among other issues. Despite the overwhelming scientific evidence that human activity is driving climate change, the report found that several BBC shows fell victim to an \u201cover-rigid application of editorial guidelines on impartiality,\u201d resulting in far too much airtime for climate change deniers. A <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://downloads.bbc.co.uk/bbctrust/assets/files/pdf/our_work/science_impartiality/trust_conclusions.pdf\">follow-up report published in 2014</a> concluded that this key conclusion \u201cstill resonates today\u201d. </p> <p>This situation, known as <a href=\"http://www.sciencemediacentre.org/media-debates-on-science-delicately-balanced/\">false balance</a>, arises when journalists present opposing view-points as being more equal than the evidence allows. But when the evidence for a position is virtually incontrovertible, it is profoundly mistaken to treat a conflicting view as equal and opposite by default. With respect to man made climate change, the BBC is far from the only outlet skewing their coverage in the name of balance, and global <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.sciencemediacentre.org/media-debates-on-science-delicately-balanced/\">coverage on climate science remains exceptionally off-kilter</a> with the scientific consensus. <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Part of the problem is that good science reporting requires a keen understanding of scientific method and the importance of evidence. In the absence of this, dubious views can perpetuate. In 1998, Andrew Wakefield held a press conference, <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3136032/\">claiming a link between autism and the MMR vaccine</a>. These allegations received scant attention from dedicated science journalists, who were familiar with anti-vaccination tropes and acutely aware of the paucity of evidence for Wakefield\u2019s claims. Anti-MMR activists instead targeted their stories at non-science journalists, selling them as human interest pieces.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p> This strategy was devastatingly effective \u2013 as author and academic<a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/bad-science-2.html\"> Ben Goldacre recounts</a>, a staggering <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.badscience.net/2003/12/mmr-never-mind-the-facts/\">10% of science stories in 2002 were MMR-related</a>, with over 80% of these pieces penned by non-science journalists. In Goldacre\u2019s words:</p> <blockquote> <p>\u201cSuddenly we were getting comment and advice on complex matters of immunology and epidemiology from people who would more usually have been telling us about a funny thing that happened with the au pair on the way to a dinner party.\u201d<em tabindex=\"-1\"> </em></p> </blockquote> <p>Editors and writers who lacked knowledge of the requisite science fell into a default assumption that two mutually opposed views must have equal merit. But the lack of evidence for such ominous claims was still rather telling, and investigative journalist Brian Deer began to scrutinise Wakefield. Deer\u2019s work eventually exposed financial conflicts of interest and unethical conduct, and in time <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://briandeer.com/mmr/lancet-summary.htm\">Wakefield\u2019s MMR claims were exposed as false</a>.</p> <p>Since then, a wealth of data has <a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/vaccines/mmr-vaccine.html\">continued to show the MMR vaccine to be completely safe</a>.The consequences of the needless panic, however, were anything but \u2013 faced with conflicting reports and unable to gauge their respective veracity, parents opted to not vaccine their children, with deadly results and an <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs286/en/\">on-going resurgence of measles worldwide</a>.</p> <p>None of this is intended to pin the blame for these deleterious consequences on journalists and media outlets alone, but the fact that anti-vaccine activists could exploit the ideal of impartiality is a worrying one. The assumption that good journalism requires mutually opposed views to be treated as equally valid simply doesn\u2019t hold when the overwhelming weight of evidence points resolutely in one direction</p> <p>It does however require a certain amount of expertise to gauge this, and for media outlets discerning between valid science and pseudoscience can be a difficult task. Journalists are under tremendous pressure to produce engaging copy, with tight deadlines. One way of reducing false balance and poor reportage is to put scientific experts in direct contact with those covering the story, and organisations such as the <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.sciencemediacentre.org/working-with-us/for-scientists/\">Science Media Centre</a> and <a href=\"http://senseaboutscience.org/\">Sense About Science</a> have had considerable success in such endeavours. I strongly recommend that scientists register their expertise with these groups to help stem the tide of misinformation. </p> <p>Scientific public engagement is helpful, but the question of when and how to engage is rife with complications. I encountered this recently, when an Irish radio station asked me to discuss the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/vaxxed\">anti-vaccine documentary Vaxxed</a> with its star \u2013 the aforementioned Andrew Wakefield. The producer claimed a rival broadcaster had offered him a slot with a sympathetic host and no counterpoint, and that there was strong local public pressure for him to appear. </p> <p> I grudgingly agreed to provide a counter, with the caveat that I would be allowed articulate why giving him a platform to air discredited views was itself unethical. The experience was a frustrating one, <a href=\"https://youtu.be/sVzMcZzqC5E?t=589]\">predictably generating more heat than light</a>.</p> <p></p> <p>This is the crux of the issue with false balance - no matter how noble the intention of media outlets, presenting science and pseudoscience in an adversarial format gives a false impression that an issue is scientifically contentious. Worse again, it gives free rein for dubious motivations to masquerade as scientific opinion. Whether the issue is vaccination, climate-change, alt-med or anything else, presenting an evidence-free belief as being on equal footing with an established scientific understanding is corrosive to public understanding. I asked scientist, author and broadcaster Simon Singh for his take on this unfortunate trend, and in his view such media requests are as time-wasting as they are inept:</p> <blockquote> <p>\u201cEvery situation is different, but I am increasingly declining interviews about, say, homeopathy, because it is not my job to provide false balance and thereby justify bad journalism. Most recently a BBC local radio station wanted to have a jolly chat about cupping in light of its use by Olympic athletes. I declined, because the piece was inevitably going to be (a) Simon says it is rubbish, (b) cupping therapists says it works for some people, (c) patient says it worked for them, (d) hosts says that opinion is divided, but isn\u2019t it interesting, and (e) a series of callers ring in with their tales of cupping miracles. I don\u2019t want to be part of that sort of journalism.\u201d</p> </blockquote> <p>It needn\u2019t be this way, however: it is entirely possible for media outlets to cover publicly contentious topics in an informative and responsible manner. The BBC has quite admirably now given its reporters training on how to avoid false balance and present complex and contentious science, <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://downloads.bbc.co.uk/bbctrust/assets/files/pdf/our_work/science_impartiality/trust_conclusions.pdf\">pointing out that</a> \u201c... science coverage does not simply lie in reflecting a wide range of views but depends on the varying degree of prominence (due weight) such views should be given.\u201d<em tabindex=\"-1\"> </em></p> <p>Part of the disconnect is that there can be a wide gulf between the scientific consensus and public opinion, with broadcasters resorting to false balance to appease their audience. But rather than default to adversarial white-noise, media outlets might benefit from framing such issues in context as a discussion. As an example of this, I was recently a radio guest with Dr Ciara Kelly, discussing the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/blog/2016/jan/11/why-is-there-opposition-hpv-vaccine-cervical-cancer\">controversy over the HPV vaccine</a>. Rather than enforce a contrived debate scenario, Dr Kelly and her producers explained to listeners why it they were opting to avoid false balance, whilst still tackling people\u2019s fears. The result of this was, in my view, <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.newstalk.com/podcasts/Alive_and_Kicking/Alive_And_Kicking/162104/The_HPV_Vaccine\">an informative dialogue</a> that explored misconceptions whilst putting them firmly in scientific context. </p> <p>When the science is relatively clear-cut, this kind of approach is orders of magnitude better than conjuring up a pointless debate, as it gives an audience an understanding of the evidence base these views are built upon. With such an approach, it is possible to cover dissenting views too, and to explore why these are not scientifically accepted. This is far more constructive and understandable than the default paradigm of two talking heads shouting one another down </p> <p>Media outlets have an important role to play in conveying vital information and view-points, pushing a standard for fact-checking and quality control that may be lacking in more fragmented modern media. But engaging in false balance undermines this strength and risks giving debunked or dangerous fringe views an air of legitimacy and the oxygen of publicity \u2013 and ultimately, such sophism leaves us all more divided and less informed. </p>",

I am less keen on the new <a href=\"http://www.marksandspencer.com/l/women/per-una\">Per Una range</a> because it looks like the clothes have been sprayed with glue and rolled through a haberdashery store. It\u2019s also a shame that they don\u2019t stock the Alexa Chung range (and the other more fashion-forward ranges) in provincial shops. </p> <p>I believe that in M&amp;S\u2019s pursuit of the fashion and cultural zeitgeist the store has forgotten the core reason people shop there: fundamentals, such as a perfectly cut navy sweater, cotton tights that wash well and don\u2019t sag, etc. It\u2019s a store that\u2019s always been there, in the background, and formerly a benchmark for a certain kind of quality, but that\u2019s not the case any more. Many of their clothes are now badly made (the tights ladder and bobble) and there\u2019s just something off about their design. I also find their shops hard to navigate. I often give up in irritation because wading through 20 rails of seemingly identical black work skirts is a waste of my time. </p> <h2><strong>Annette </strong><strong>Graat, 60, M</strong>aastricht: \u2018It\u2019s a popular store in the Netherlands.

This is really disappointing because the food department is great as it offers lots of products we don\u2019t usually get here. I like their traditionally British foods, such as scones, and all their nice meats. The clothes are a bit traditional and not really exciting, however. They are also a bit overpriced, but I will definitely miss the food. I also feel it\u2019s a missed opportunity as lots of people in this area could be potential customers and many are upset about the closure. I read a Twitter post today from a food blogger in the Netherlands who said: \u201cNo, not more bad news!\u201d</p> <h2>Gregory Baser, 58, Plymouth: \u2018The sizing has really changed over the years, which is frustrating\u2019</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"0a58b966c0e227c240a0b761c535a15b23fd11ed\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0a58b966c0e227c240a0b761c535a15b23fd11ed/0_0_280_280/280.png\" alt=\"Gregory Baser\" width=\"280\" height=\"280\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>I love the Sparks card and its targeted promotions, the underpants and socks, the trousers (especially the coloured ones). I like the suits. I am a loyal customer and have shopped there for more than 45 years, but even though I am a fan of the clothing I do feel it\u2019s got worse over time. For example, with the shirts there are now much less options in terms of colour. Also the sizing has really changed over the years, and shirts I bought years ago that were XXLs are XXXLs today. Being forced up a size means there\u2019s less on offer for me in terms of variety. <br></p> <p>Marks &amp; Spencer\u2019s takeaway food is its strongest food selling point, but the lunchtime deals have got a bit more complicated. There\u2019s now more on offer but that shouldn\u2019t be at the detriment of losing classics, such as the cheese and tomato ones. They offer a nice in-store bakery in their main branch in Plymouth but sometimes the portions aren\u2019t big enough. </p> <p>I am disappointed that they are giving up on a lot of their clothes stores overall. I know it must be difficult with stores like Primark opening up but they used to be really great. And it felt like they were taking some steps in the right direction, for example by sorting out their website. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"eb6e5d242e7f7d8337c56c5a4b1438b60a30a1c2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/eb6e5d242e7f7d8337c56c5a4b1438b60a30a1c2/0_337_1823_2397/761.jpg\" alt=\"M & S sandwich\" width=\"761\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Marks &amp; Spencer\u2019s takeaway food is it\u2019s strongest food selling point.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: P\u00e5l Hansen/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Stephanie Wong, 38, London: \u2018The only person the Alexa Chung range looks good on is, well, Alexa Chung\u2019<br></h2> <p>They do the best lunch salads of any high-street chain.

I have these lightweight lounge pants that I am obsessed with. The crockery is also good value and reasonable quality. Their women\u2019s daytime clothing range, however, is still terrible. The only person the Alexa Chung range looks good on is, well, Alexa Chung. On any average-sized woman, her whole range looks frumpy. </p> <p>I don\u2019t know who \u201cMrs M&amp;S\u201d is, but the poor woman has been wearing hideous T-shirts and cardigans in lurid tomato reds and hideous deep electric blues in stiff cotton for far too long. I would love it if M&amp;S refocused its clothing line for women on \u201cbasics\u201d along the lines of its children\u2019s range. They could also take a leaf out of H&amp;M in terms of basic design standards, fabrics and versatile colours. Or just copy their underpants, sock and children\u2019s clothes, to be honest. Just don\u2019t touch the children\u2019s clothes, they are so good. </p> <h2>Callum, 35, Merseyside: \u2018The high-quality food products are what makes M&amp;S so brilliant\u2019</h2> <p>M&amp;S food products are brilliant and noticeably higher quality than many other food retailers for the most part. This is their strongest area. They do also have extremely well-designed homeware. This leaves their clothing ranges as the weaker link, but they definitely serve a core audience. Their attempts at chasing a younger market haven\u2019t worked but it would be a shame if their ranges were removed completely. It seems like they need simpler and fewer ranges, with a clearer target market. </p> <p>It would be sad to see stores close. As a British person it is reassuring to see M&amp;S stores in other countries, particularly when buying food. Hopefully this will remain unaltered. I\u2019ve shopped at M&amp;S for more than 10 years, my family always went there and as a young child I was fascinated by their attractive packaging and well-designed food ranges. Their home products have become more contemporary and attractive, and much more informed by Scandinavian design, which is a good thing. Much of their range is similar to the likes of Habitat. So it has definitely changed and very much kept at the forefront of demand. Their staff are also considerably better than many other stores, and it\u2019s good to see that they employ so many people that clearly have experience and manners. </p> <h2>Megan Peel, 38, Harrogate: \u2018I used to shop at M&amp;S food but don\u2019t now \u2013 their food is so over-packaged to me\u2019</h2>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>They claim to be sustainable but how can they be when all their food is wrapped in so much plastic?</p> <footer> <cite>Megan Peel</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The only items I now really buy at M&amp;S are clothes for my one-year-old. They are exactly what I want in terms of fabrics and patterns, but when I look for clothes for my four-year-old there\u2019s much less on offer. It\u2019s not stylish and it looks cheaper. I used to shop regularly at M&amp;S food but I don\u2019t any more as their food feels so over-packaged to me. They claim to be sustainable but how can they be when all their food is wrapped in so much plastic? So I shop less at M&amp;S than I used to. I would definitely never shop for women\u2019s clothes there: the price of their clothes is up there with the likes of Jigsaw, but the experience of shopping at Jigsaw is much better. Shopping in supermarkets is not nearly as nice. Strategically, I feel they are missing a massive opportunity; with British Home Stores closing they could champion British retail by promoting young British designers. They could also do more of their manufacturing in the UK.</p> <h2>Anonymous, 46, Sheffield: \u2018 I have been forced to shop elsewhere for knickers for the first time in my life\u2019</h2> <p>My current gripes about M&amp;S are as follows: <br></p> <ul> <li>They no longer seem to stock ordinary cotton knickers in a variety of styles. <br></li> <li>All of their individual knickers that are not part of a matching set seem to be nylon.</li> <li>You can only buy cotton knickers in bags of five, with very few styles/colours to choose from.</li> </ul> <p>The choice is so poor that I have been forced to shop elsewhere for knickers for the first time in my life. I never thought this would happen and I hate it. Their women\u2019s clothing range is an incoherent mess. They seem to be trying to be all things to all people. They should get back to offering classic pieces for each season, reducing the number of stock items, and presenting them as outfits in the stores instead of just hanging all the trousers together, etc. I\u2019m sick of having to schlep around the store to see if they have a scarf to match a jumper.</p> <p>The quality of the finish needs to improve markedly. I am tired of hems coming down and buttons falling off. I have had to pay for two zips to be replaced on faulty M&amp;S garments this year. I would gladly pay a bit more for better quality. </p> <p>It seems sensible to focus on the successful part of the business \u2013 food \u2013 but this ignores the fact that M&amp;S should be a clothing retailer, not a supermarket. They need to reconnect with their core customers and offer good quality pieces to middle-aged women, rather than trying to compete for the Topshop/Zara market. </p>",
  "<p>\u2018Change is happening!\u201d says the message stencilled, in bright green, on a peeling wall just behind Hull\u2019s new marina.

A city long buffeted by the wrong kinds of change now stands on the verge of potential renaissance; for <a href=\"https://www.hull2017.co.uk/\">Hull is next year\u2019s official UK City of Culture</a>, beneficiary of a public art project aiming to do here what similar European programmes did for Liverpool in 2008 and Glasgow in 1990.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2013/nov/20/hull-10-reasons-uk-city-culture-2017\">Hull: 10 reasons to visit the UK city of culture 2017</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The official opening spectacular isn\u2019t until 1 January but the buzz has begun. Over summer, thousands of locals stripped naked and had themselves painted blue for a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/gallery/2016/jul/09/sea-of-hull-by-spencer-tunick-in-pictures\">Spencer Tunick installation</a> celebrating the city\u2019s relationship with the sea; <a href=\"http://www.tate.org.uk/context-comment/articles/turner-prize-2017-hull-announced\">the Turner prize</a> is coming here next year, plus a one-off gig from David Bowie\u2019s old backing band <a href=\"https://www.hull2017.co.uk/whatson/events/the-rise-fall-of-ziggy-stardust-the-spiders-from-mars/\">the Spiders from Mars</a>. \u201cGo on the terraces at Hull City football club, and one of the chants now is, \u2018You\u2019re only here for the culture\u2019,\u201d says Daren Hale, deputy leader of the city council.</p> <p>But this isn\u2019t just about rebranding Hull as a tourist destination \u2013 although it has made <a href=\"https://www.roughguides.com/best-places/2016/top-10-cities/#\">Rough Guide\u2019s list of top 10 world cities to visit this year</a> and a stroll through the old city\u2019s narrow cobbled streets, studded with cosy pubs, reveals a rather different place from the one outsiders imagine. City of Culture is really a shot at economic redemption, and if the idea of building a future on poetry and song feels hopelessly airy-fairy, beneath it is a hard-headed attempt to portray Hull as a feelgood city to which big employers might want to bring their staff. For it\u2019s jobs that will ultimately revive those pockets of the city tourists don\u2019t come to see, as Hale points out: \u201cOnce you come here you see there\u2019s a real creative buzz, and people say: \u2018This is the sort of place you could do business and you could settle\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>But that\u2019s no longer the only vision of Hull\u2019s future on the table. In June, despite warnings that Brexit risked its future as a port city that trades daily with the outside world, Hull voted to leave Europe. If it was already a city at a crossroads, in the words of filmmaker and opening ceremony curator <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/sep/20/a-syrian-love-story-review-microcosm-of-global-crisis\">Sean McAllister</a>, it\u2019s even more so now. One road harks back to bygone days when other countries sent their ships here, but not their people; the other evokes a bright, high-skilled future that nonetheless sounds uncertain to people who have heard such promises before. Of all the jaunty City of Culture slogans plastered across the city, the most evocative is a banner near the pierhead. \u201cWhere have you been all our lives?\u201d it asks, in a way that could be plaintive or mildly acerbic.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"085f494d12b14d12d2db448ce5d7607a576c1531\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/085f494d12b14d12d2db448ce5d7607a576c1531/0_139_5478_3590/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sign of confidence on a Hull street.

It\u2019s friendly enough to tourists but as the Hull-born author and poet Russ Litten writes in My People Come From The Sea, there\u2019s a tendency to \u201cignore the rest of the country, face away/lips pursed, arms crossed\u201d.</p> <p>Yet there\u2019s a lot going on behind those masks. As the poem goes on, \u201cMy people come from deep waters/My people are deep waters/My people are in deep water.\u201d They are indeed \u2013 Hull was the third most deprived local authority in England last year, with household disposable income a third less than the national average \u2013 but suspicion of City of Culture\u2019s proffered lifebelt lingers. There have been complaints about local artists being overlooked in favour of famous outsiders, and scepticism about what commercial regeneration means for the kind of non-conformist city that remains proud of holding out for years against getting a Starbucks.</p> <p>Litten has long been a driving force on Hull\u2019s musical and literary scene, and while the 2017 programme excites him, he worries too little of it is created by or for locals. \u201cFor people inside the city, I hope it doesn\u2019t make us feel self-conscious,\u201d he says, when asked how he hopes people will feel by the year\u2019s end. \u201cI\u2019d like to think that people would feel empowered to create stuff rather than just consume stuff. And for people from the outside, to be perfectly honest, I couldn\u2019t care less. The minute you start to worry about what people think and how they view you, you\u2019ve had it.\u201d</p> <p>Litten grew up in the Hessle Road area, a working-class community ripped apart in the 1970s when <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cod_Wars\">territorial battles with Iceland</a> scuppered its fishing industry, and he\u2019s not alone in linking that history with Hull\u2019s flinty resilience. <a href=\"https://filthybroke.bandcamp.com/track/my-people-come-from-the-sea\">My People Come From The Sea</a>, improvised for a spoken word album with local musician Steve Cobby, is based on their grandfathers\u2019 stories. \u201cOur families lived close to death,\u201d he says simply. \u201cSix times more people died in fishing than in mining. Where I\u2019m from was like a village within a city and it bred a specific type of person, very stoic.\u201d When Sheffield and Hull both flooded a few years back, he says, TV crews descended on Sheffield to film stricken householders but Hull just cracked on, out of sight and mind.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cde1c87bc87d22a6b49ca183fe9881232c190ab8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cde1c87bc87d22a6b49ca183fe9881232c190ab8/0_8_5175_3104/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Hull marina ... the business development alongside includes a hub for tech startups...

It has a quirky, almost eccentric side supporting a thriving artistic scene, and Litten argues that it\u2019s a great place to be creative; rents are cheap, geographical isolation fosters originality, and so does the landscape of sea to the east and rolling fields to the west. \u201cIt\u2019s flat, and artists like a horizon, don\u2019t they?\u201d</p> <p>But years of being laughed at by outsiders \u2013 famously, the book <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2003/oct/02/britishidentity.regeneration\">Crap Towns</a> once called it Britain\u2019s \u201cworst place to live\u201d \u2013 has left its mark.</p> <p>\u201cCulturally and psychologically, because the city was run down by people outside for so long, it kind of bites,\u201d says Andrew Young, a strategic consultant to universities whose Twitter account <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Hullbhoy\">@Hullbhoy</a> plugs all that\u2019s good about his home town. He sees City of Culture both as injecting new ideas and challenging those who knock Hull without ever having been: \u201cI think it\u2019s fantastic to have the spotlight on the city and big national players on the stage. We don\u2019t get the London Philharmonic here, but we\u2019ve got it in 2017.\u201d</p> <p>Yet he concedes the spotlight isn\u2019t comfortable for everyone. \u201cPeople in Hull can be quite timid in terms of shouting about what they do. If you go to Glasgow people aren\u2019t slow in coming forward and telling you what\u2019s going on. We don\u2019t do that so much.\u201d And that ingrained reticence can make Hull a hard city to help.</p> <p>Diana Johnson, MP for Hull North, says the city was \u201clate to the party\u201d in the boom years for urban regeneration, hesitating to hustle for funding when rivals such as Newcastle and Liverpool were doing so. And now it\u2019s finally at the front of the queue, the party is winding down. Few envisage Conservative ministers spending more now on rundown estates than Labour did during a boom.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"81cf4e69115fef6f1457287e8095e0dc3e972b86\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/81cf4e69115fef6f1457287e8095e0dc3e972b86/0_156_4932_2960/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Seagoing heritage ...

Photograph: Bert Hardy/Picture Post/Getty Images</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bert Hardy/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The good news is that alongside winning its City of Culture bid, Hull recently secured a \u00a3310m commitment by the German-owned firm Siemens <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-humber-37775300\">to build new offshore wind turbines in the city</a>, creating up to 1,000 jobs. Alan Johnson, MP for Hull West and Hessle, has argued offshore wind could do for the city what oil did for Aberdeen, and if that was a cheerier analogy before the oil price crashed, it\u2019s still a breakthrough for a city that\u2019s struggled in the past to woo inward investors. The city\u2019s luck seemed to be turning, which in some ways makes the decisive backing for Brexit more surprising. </p> <p>Hale puts it down to a now familiar mix of anti-establishment feeling, longstanding anger at the EU\u2019s treatment of the fishing industry, but above all immigration.</p> <p>For decades Hull had experienced relatively little, but then eastern Europeans started coming to work on the outlying farms as well as in the city. Drive north of the centre, past the leafy university quarter, and you soon find a scruffier landscape of pound shops and cut-price carwashes, many of the latter immigrant-owned. In the mid-90s the biggest ethnic minority group in town was Chinese, according to Hale, constituting about 1% of the population; now, he reckons anywhere up to 15% are from immigrant backgrounds. \u201cIt\u2019s been massively good for the city in lots of ways but it\u2019s a massive change in the culture.\u201d</p> <p>The incomers have, he says, helped reverse inner-city decline by bringing empty shops and homes into use: \u201cPeople hark back to the day of the butcher, baker and candlestick maker but those shops had gone. The eastern Europeans were opening up boarded-up, empty shops.\u201d</p> <p>But Ukip, now second behind Labour in Hull\u2019s three parliamentary seats, is finding a ready audience for its message here. The vote, Johnson thinks, was a protest not just against immigration but \u201cthe fact that Hull hasn\u2019t done as well in recent years, people feel their wages don\u2019t go up as fast as prices\u201d. And then there were those who, like some of Litten\u2019s friends on the left, voted Leave for radical socialist reasons. \u201cIt was a \u2018fuck you\u2019 to the establishment, saying don\u2019t tell us what to do,\u201d he explains.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2cb6fcea1b941f2a74705e705684661f90f4f8cd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2cb6fcea1b941f2a74705e705684661f90f4f8cd/0_180_5400_3240/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Deep ...

But it had ultimately hoped to export turbines made here across Europe, and local politicians are worried about the longterm prospects for investment given uncertainty over life outside a single market. If the worst fears about a hard Brexit are realised, Hull may just have voted to shoot itself in the foot. </p> <p>Walking to a meeting in the city, I cross its last foiled attempt at regeneration. The innovative <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2013/jul/28/scale-lane-bridge-hull-review\">Scale Lane Bridge</a> over the river Hull, which swings aside for shipping, is where Tunick assembled his naked blue people but it\u2019s more than just a landmark. It was originally conceived to link the picturesque old city on the west bank with a largely derelict industrial site on the east, which would then be turned into a swanky waterside development complete with new hotel. The hotel was built but the banking crash killed off everything else, leaving just an unusually spectacular approach to a marooned Premier Inn, and a reminder of Hull\u2019s vulnerability to forces beyond its control.</p> <p>The optimist\u2019s view is that if hard times are coming again, they could at least foster creative revival. \u201cAll great art is born out of struggle, and the need for survival,\u201d says Litten. \u201cLook at punk, reggae, acid house.\u201d</p> <p>If new artforms are to emerge in Hull, however, they may come from the development around the marina, which includes a spanking new hub for tech startups. It\u2019s not Shoreditch, but you could live here far more cheaply than in London while trying to get a business off the ground \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.hulldailymail.co.uk/hull-50-best-urban-places-live-list-8211-sunday/story-26126697-detail/story.html\">Hull made the Sunday Times top 10 urban places to live last year</a> partly for its affordable housing \u2013 and the idea is to encourage computer science students from the University of Hull to stay around after graduation.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f584c57606e017843532bf4526f95d4387a811ef\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f584c57606e017843532bf4526f95d4387a811ef/0_291_4368_2621/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Beneath the city\u2019s tough outer skin there\u2019s an offbeat charm ...

Hull may never quite be Liverpool, reinvented as a sexy weekend destination with its Beatles Museum and its Tate and its thriving bars. But there\u2019s an offbeat charm beneath this city\u2019s tough outer skin and if nothing else, it deserves respect for trying. This is a bold roll of the dice, from a city that doesn\u2019t necessarily have a plan B. What\u2019s the worst that could happen if you gave it an evening or a weekend of your free time?</p> <p>Walking back later towards the bridge, I pass a karaoke bar where men are downing cut-price pints while someone belts out a song I\u2019ve not heard for decades: the Beautiful South\u2019s Perfect 10. \u201cI love her body, especially the lies/Time takes its toll, but not on the eyes.\u201d Time has taken its toll on Hull, but the bones of what it was and could be remain.

  "<p></p> <p>As she has reminded us through her campaign, Hillary Clinton has 30 years of political experience she may drag over the finish line into the executive office. But her opponent represents a series of unknowable unknowns.<strong> </strong>Sure, Donald Trump is as well-known as Clinton, but he has chalked up not a single month of political office, and has no track record. </p> <p>It\u2019s also very hard to work out who his key advisers will be. His campaign is very much a family affair. Much of the Republican establishment has distanced themselves from him \u2013 some so far <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/mar/18/stop-donald-trump-presidency-republicans-vote-hillary-clinton\">they will be voting for Clinton</a>. It is not clear who his key economic, defence or foreign policy advisers are and 50 former Republican national security advisers <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/09/us/politics/national-security-gop-donald-trump.html?smid=tw-nytpolitics&amp;smtyp=cur&amp;_r=1\">publicly declared</a> against him in August. They are unlikely to be summoned back into the State, Defense or Homeland Security departments.</p> <p>There are also clear policy differences between Trump and his more experienced vice-presidential running mate, Mike Pence. Trump has publicly declared, in a presidential debate, that he <a href=\"http://www.vanityfair.com/news/2016/10/donald-trump-mike-pence-relationship\">disagreed</a> with Pence on Syria. So the prospect that Trump would sit back and let Pence run the executive while he \u201cmakes America Great again\u201d looks low. </p> <p></p> <h2><strong>Both candidates would face challenges governing </strong></h2> <h2></h2> <p>Both candidates will face a challenge in terms of how much they could actually do if elected. That will depend on the Congressional arithmetic. But Trump and Pence are short of any of the Capitol Hill experience that can help US presidents get Congress to work. And after such a polarising election, gridlock looks the most likely outcome even for such a seasoned operator as Clinton. That means domestic inaction \u2013 but also means that the president may be tempted to focus even more on redefining the US\u2019s international role.</p> <h2><strong>These unknowns will make planning in the UK very difficult</strong></h2> <p>In the run-up to any US election, the British embassy in Washington will try to build contacts to people who are likely to form part of the next administration and try to work out how a new president\u2019s policy positions will affect UK interests.</p> <p>Most famously Jonathan Powell, who went on to be Tony Blair\u2019s chief of staff, was detailed to get to know the team of a then little-known governor from Arkansas back in 1992. That set the basis for the close relationship between new Democrats and New Labour. Access to the Trump campaign will have been harder.</p> <p>The National Security Council should have been having discussions on the potential implications of a Trump presidency for Nato, relations with Russia, the Middle East and wider security issues. But they will hang on any post-election words for more concrete indications of a new style of governing. Diplomats will then lobby for an early visit to the US to cement the specialness of the special relationship.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/public-leaders-network/2016/jun/24/whitehall-brexit-civil-servants-jeremy-heywood\">Whitehall has no roadmap for the gargantuan task of enabling Brexit</a> </p> </aside>  <h2><strong>But what will they talk about?</strong></h2> <p>The UK has in the past presented itself as a bridge between Europe and the US.

Unfortunately, The Crown <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/nov/03/the-crown-windsor-claire-foy-elizabeth-blockbuster\" title=\"\">views postwar Britain</a> from the perspective of our sovereign and all who inhabited her world. This does an enormous disservice to the epoch, because it was a time when a socialist tide raised all boats. History was literally being made from the bottom up because, while Princess Elizabeth was being fitted for her wedding dress, ordinary Britons were dismantling a thousand years of feudal mentality through the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2001/mar/14/past.education\" title=\"\">creation of the welfare state</a>.</p> <p>We\u2019ve seen this approach before. Nothing better illustrates TV\u2019s lush treacle homage to the landed gentry than <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/downton-abbey\" title=\"\">Downton Abbey</a>, a drama that ran for six series as a parlour-room interpretation of historical moments that shaped Britain at the turn of the 20th century. But Downton has not been the exception to the rule, rather a template used by TV and movie producers to crush the truth from history and make the entitled the heroes of narratives about our nation\u2019s collective past.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d9d31365395667b41f7f2d15cc123c74a3371ddb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d9d31365395667b41f7f2d15cc123c74a3371ddb/0_0_3600_2396/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Still from The Crown.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"666\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018The Crown depicts moments in history as a pageant in which the wealthy, the entitled and the nobility oversee the lives of millions with benevolence, wisdom and grace.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alex Bailey/Netflix</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The Crown, like Downton Abbey, Victoria or even Indian Summers, depicts moments in history as a pageant in which the wealthy, the entitled and the nobility oversee the lives of millions with benevolence, wisdom and grace. As I have been both a witness to and participant in history since 1923, I can tell you that was not the case. Millions lived lives of abject misery during the 1930s while the 1% of that time enjoyed an obscene opulence. Despite the vast wealth of 19th-century history a TV dramatist can draw upon, our nation\u2019s rich heritage too often becomes an infomercial for monarchy and empire.</p> <p>The Crown is like an expensive painting in which the only subjects in focus are the rich and privileged. Everyone else, people like me or your grandparents if they came from the working class and even the middle class, are considered no more than background scenery. We are the undefined face in the crowd waving religiously at our so-called betters.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0211341b0d1885bad2d6cf6d333d2d55c786406d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0211341b0d1885bad2d6cf6d333d2d55c786406d/0_517_5385_3231/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Stoke on Trent in the 1950s.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018We need now more than ever our great film-makers and television producers to tell the stories from our collective past that reflect all its pathos and wonder.\u2019 Stoke on Trent in the 1950s.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dave Bagnall Collection/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>To my mind, The Crown is an insult to the struggles my generation overcame and the triumphs we earned from our sacrifices in both war and in peace. But what is most frightening is that the tableau of our past shown on Netflix and other TV networks will be most people\u2019s window on my generation\u2019s history. Too many in the 19th and early 20th century lived thwarted lives because of the exploitation they endured in the mines and mills. Yet no one tells the tale of these workers unionising, fighting for their rights or trying to find and maintain love in the harsh conditions of the slums they called home.</p> <p>Too many of my generation died young because they lacked the money to pay for a doctor, but in The Crown our sympathies are directed to a king dying of lung cancer rather than the thousands of miners who died painfully of black lung because that monarch and his society didn\u2019t believe the average citizen deserved medicine if they couldn\u2019t afford to pay for it.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4af22533b64e40c4d3a33c2677ff691b011ee1f0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4af22533b64e40c4d3a33c2677ff691b011ee1f0/0_426_5965_3578/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A London street party in 1953 celebrating the Queen\u2019s coronation.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Londoners in 1953 celebrating the Queen\u2019s coronation.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Paul Springett A/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Our Queen, no matter how much we should respect her service to the state, doesn\u2019t deserve to be turned into a cinematic icon.

  "<h2>Candidates sign off on 2016 election campaigns</h2> <p>The long, bitter presidential campaign is finally over and the two historically unpopular candidates have handed off to the nation\u2019s 225,788,000 eligible voters.

Obama, passing the torch to Clinton, echoed the themes of 2008 as he urged voters to \u201creject fear and embrace hope\u201d. The party was joined on stage by Lady Gaga and Jon Bon Jovi.

  "<p>The work and pensions secretary, Damian Green, has dismissed a <a href=\"http://www.ohchr.org/EN/HRBodies/CRPD/Pages/InquiryProcedure.aspx\">critical UN report</a> that concluded that the UK government\u2019s austerity policies <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/nov/07/uk-austerity-policies-amount-to-violations-of-disabled-peoples-rights\">\u201csystematically violated\u201d</a> the rights of disabled people.</p> <p>Green said the report was \u201cpatronising and offensive\u201d and presented an outdated view of disability in the UK. He said Britain was \u201ca world leader in disability rights and equality\u201d.<br></p> <p>But disability activists and charities welcomed the report, saying it accurately highlighted the real economic and social pressures faced by disabled people after years of harsh spending cuts to social security and social care.</p> <p>The shadow work and pensions secretary, Debbie Abrahams, said the UN report was \u201ccrystal clear\u201d in its identification of UK government failures. \u201cIt confirms that, despite Theresa May\u2019s warm words, this government is failing sick and disabled people,\u201d she said.</p> <p>The UN committee said a range of measures introduced since 2010, including the bedroom tax and cuts to disability benefits and social care budgets, had disproportionately and adversely affected disabled people.</p> <p>Spending cuts had negatively affected the rights of disabled people to live independently, to work and to achieve an adequate standard of living, the report said. It urged UK ministers to ensure the rights of disabled people were upheld.</p> <p>Government ministers contributed to the inquiry that led to the report and are understood to have been presented with the findings earlier this year.</p> <p>Green said: \u201cAt the heart of this report lies an outdated view of disability which is patronising and offensive. We strongly refute its findings. The UN measures success as the amount of money poured into the system, rather than the work and health outcomes for disabled people. Our focus is on helping disabled people find and stay in work, whilst taking care of those who can\u2019t.\u201d</p> <p>The government said it spent about \u00a350bn a year to support sick and disabled people \u2013 a bigger proportion of GDP than countries including Canada, France and the US.</p> <p>It said the recent publication of its <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/oct/31/government-aims-to-halve-disability-employment-gap-in-uk\">work and health green paper</a>, which included ambitious proposals to increase employment levels among disabled people, was \u201ca turning point in our action to confront the attitudes, prejudices and misunderstandings within the minds of employers and across wider society.\u201d<br></p> <p>But Abrahams said the report echoed warnings Labour had been making since 2011 about the effects of the government\u2019s policies on disabled people. </p> <p> \u201cThe UN committee is clear that its report examines the cumulative impact of legislation, policies and measures adopted from 2010 to October 2016, so the government\u2019s claim that it is outdated does not stand up to scrutiny.</p> <p>\u201cI am also concerned that the government is labelling the report as patronising, when they are the ones dismissing the concerns raised by disabled people who helped instigate the inquiry in the first place.\u201d</p> <p>Vicki Nash, head of policy and campaigns at the mental health charity Mind, said the UN findings were extremely concerning but came as no surprise. </p> <p>\u201cThe government has ambitions to help many more people with mental health problems back into work but, as this inquiry points out, the current approach is cruel, inappropriate and doesn\u2019t work.\u201d</p> <p>Liz Sayce, the chief executive of Disability Rights UK, said the government was right to emphasise its commitment to helping disabled people get into and stay in work, but it had failed to invest sufficiently in inclusion and participation in recent years, leaving many people reliant on social protection.</p> <p>Neil Crowther, an independent disability rights expert, said: \u2018It\u2019s deeply sad to see the UK \u2013 once a proud global leader on disabled people\u2019s rights \u2013 being found guilty of systematically violating them. </p> <p>\u201cBritain\u2019s own joint parliamentary committee on human rights warned of the risks to disabled people\u2019s human rights that would result from the combined effect of reform and spending decisions in 2012. After extensive research and consultation, the UN committee has found that these risks have come to pass. </p> <p>\u201cWith further cuts to social security still to come and no plans for additional investment in social care, it seems likely that things are only going to get worse. The government\u2019s complacent response offers little reassurance to the contrary.\u201d </p> <p>Dan Scorer, head of policy at Mencap, said:<strong> </strong>\u201cThis report is further acknowledgement that cutting disabled people\u2019s benefits will only make life harder and isolate people further from inclusion in employment and wider society. People with a learning disability face massive exclusion from the labour market, and have seen their benefits and funding for vital social care services reduced.\u201d</p> <p>Michelle Mitchell, chief executive of the MS Society, said:<strong> </strong>\u201cThis is yet more evidence that there\u2019s a clear need for changes to disability benefits. The system is currently failing too many people with MS.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/sep/16/disability-un-investigation-uk-government-violations-human-rights\">Linda Burnip</a>, a founder of <a href=\"http://dpac.uk.net/\">Disabled People Against Cuts</a>, a grassroots campaign group that helped trigger the UN inquiry in 2013, said the findings \u201ccame as no surprise to anyone who has followed the stripping away of disabled people\u2019s rights over the last six years\u201d.\u201d</p> <p>The inquiry report was based on an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/oct/20/un-inquiry-uk-disability-rights-violations-cprd-welfare-cuts\">11-day tour</a> of the UK undertaken by two UN envoys in October 2015.

And in our constitution, when judicial independence is threatened, the lord chancellor has a legal duty to intervene. Liz Truss, however, failed to say anything for nearly 48 hours and when she did, she <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2016/nov/05/barristers-urge-liz-truss-to-condemn-attacks-on-brexit-ruling-judges\" title=\"\">simply recited</a> the principle of the independence of the judiciary and stated the government would be appealing against the judgment. She did not condemn the fact that our judges had been declared \u201cenemies of the people\u201d, nor that the sexuality of a judge had been introduced in to the debate.</p> <p>When Truss took office <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jul/21/liz-truss-first-ever-female-lord-chancellor-justice-secretary\" title=\"\">she swore an oath</a> to uphold the independence of the judiciary and the rule of law. In her speech that day she committed to doing so \u201cwith dedication\u201d. The headlines which appeared in a number of newspapers the day after the high court ruling in the article 50 case was the first test of her commitment. On any reasonable measure, she failed that test.</p> <p>That\u2019s not just my view. The former lord chief justice, Lord Judge, was interviewed on Radio 4 on Sunday and said this: \u201cThe lord chancellor has a specific function and in this case her responsibility, where there has been vituperative criticism of judges, damaging to public confidence in the administration of justice by an independent judiciary, is to speak up for them and explain exactly what the principles are.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>For many in the legal community, studied silence on this matter means a lord chancellor loses their trust</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>He went on to say about Truss\u2019s response to the attacks: \u201cI think it was a little too late and I think it\u2019s quite a lot too little. Because it doesn\u2019t actually address the damage to public confidence consequent on [these] kind of headlines.\u201d</p> <p>During my 10 years as a lawyer before being elected to parliament and then becoming shadow lord chancellor, there were occasions when I disagreed with \u2013 or was disappointed with \u2013 judges\u2019 decisions. When I lost a case, I was disappointed. When I won a case, the lawyer on the other side was disappointed. But we would never tolerate our judiciary being declared as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/nov/04/labour-condemns-newspaper-attacks-on-judges-after-brexit-ruling\" title=\"\">\u201cagainst the people\u201d</a> or a judge\u2019s sexuality being brought into the debate.</p> <p>Anyone is free to disagree with a judge\u2019s decision, their reasoning \u2013 or lack of it \u2013 or their interpretation of the law. But what is surely unacceptable is attacks on the independence of the judiciary by government ministers and powerful government-backing newspapers.

And then she provided a statement carefully crafted to say as little as possible, which has only attracted further criticism. And since then she has remained out of sight. Conservative MPs mindful of the rule of law have criticised her publicly and, reportedly, privately, at a fractious meeting of Tory MPs at which she is supposed to have said that it is the job of the lord chief justice to defend the judiciary. Actually, it is Truss\u2019s statutory responsibility \u2013 and the lord chief justice is one of the judges who heard the case and is being maligned.</p> <p>I know Truss has a lot on, given the crisis of violence and underfunding that has developed in our prison service, but for many in the legal community, studied silence on this specific matter means a lord chancellor loses their trust and confidence. Her failure to speak out has consequences: only yesterday afternoon, during a debate on Brexit in the Commons, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/nov/07/david-davis-parliament-will-not-dictate-brexit-talks\" title=\"\">David Davis</a> repeatedly failed to condemn the headlines when asked.

Several ran The Iron Heel a close second.</p> <p>But there was also strong support for taking London\u2019s two classic canines-in-the-Yukon books, White Fang and The Call of the Wild, together, forming, as participants neatly labelled it, a doggy diptych. This joint ticket proceeded to come in joint second along with The People of the Abyss \u2013 until reading group stalwart Natasha Fatale leaped in at just the right moment with a casting vote. So I propose that we read The Call of the Wild and White Fang first, discuss those two next week, and then come to Heel towards the end of the month, once we\u2019re all feeling a bit calmer. Or entirely terrified.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/gallery/2016/sep/13/jack-london-the-paths-men-take-photographs-book\">Jack London documents his world \u2013 in pictures</a> </p> </aside>  <p>That\u2019s not to say we\u2019ll escape politics entirely as we read White Fang and The Call of the Wild, which are not just stories about dogs. White Fang, for instance \u2013 try not to be alarmed \u2013 was partly inspired by Nietzche\u2019s ideas about the superman. The books can also be seen as allegories for London\u2019s own wild life and his journey from outcast hobo to prosperous writer. As stories about human injustice and the shape of society, they may be as sharp toothed in their politics as the Iron Heel.</p> <p>That said, the main things I remember from my own childhood reading is the evocative descriptions of the Yukon and the great northern emptinesses, particularly superb passages such as the famous opening of White Fang:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Dark spruce forest frowned on either side the frozen waterway. The trees had been stripped by a recent wind of their white covering of frost, and they seemed to lean towards each other, black and ominous, in the fading light. A vast silence reigned over the land. The land itself was a desolation, lifeless, without movement, so lone and cold that the spirit of it was not even that of sadness. There was a hint in it of laughter, but of a laughter more terrible than any sadness \u2013 a laughter that was mirthless as the smile of the sphinx, a laughter cold as the frost and partaking of the grimness of infallibility. It was the masterful and incommunicable wisdom of eternity laughing at the futility of life and the effort of life. It was the Wild, the savage, frozen-hearted Northland Wild.</p> </blockquote> <p>Yes, please. As soon as I\u2019ve finished writing this, I\u2019m going to put the kettle on, put some logs on the fire and break out for the wilderness. Who knows, maybe I\u2019ll learn some survival skills that will help over the next few days.</p>",

The forces that made that impossible for the past 240 years are same ones that taught these men to measure their power in terms of their control of women, that it\u2019s excusable to treat women as trophies or toys.</p> <p>While Trump is the only person running for high office who\u2019s had more than a dozen different women come forward to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/13/list-of-donald-trump-sexual-misconduct-allegations\">accuse him</a> of sexual misbehavior and assault, he\u2019s far from the only powerful man to have internalized misogynistic values. And while the wider electorate, and women and minorities in particular, have signaled we are ready to evolve from this social barbarism, the swell of popular support for Trump signals that too many men in America are not.</p> <p>It\u2019s not just Republican men, either. Hillary Clinton\u2019s biggest weakness when it comes to painting herself as a leader for women is her own husband\u2019s past. Bill Clinton\u2019s record doesn\u2019t look so good re-litigated by the standards of 2016. As a result, he\u2019s wisely opted to get out of the way. His most effective speech of the campaign, given at the Democratic national convention in Philadelphia, was more love ballad than call to arms. \u201cIn the summer of 1971,\u201d he began, \u201cI met a girl ...\u201d</p> <p>A few decades back, it was she, not Bill, who was the political liability in the relationship, famously refusing to change her last name, bake cookies, and stand by her man in the soul-crushing Tammy Wynette sense of that phrase. But our culture has shifted dramatically since then.</p> <p>As more women make the same choices young Hillary Rodham did, she appears in our rear window as ahead of her time. But so much of this race has been stuck in the gender politics of the past. </p> <p>Her character has been reduced to \u201cresilience\u201d; her theme music is Fight Song; the one thing everyone, <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2016/10/2016-presidential-debate-donald-trump-hillary-clinton-fighter-229499\">even Trump</a>, will praise her for is staring down defeat after defeat after defeat. Many of the words used to describe Clinton tell us as much about us as they do about her. </p> <p>And the final insult is that she may just lose it all again. Because, well, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/28/fbi-reopens-hillary-clinton-emails-investigation\">Anthony Weiner</a>. It\u2019s not so much that Clinton is innately secretive and often seemingly bereft of personality \u2013 it\u2019s that being a woman seeking power in our society made her that way.</p> <p>This has already been a big year for feminism, but there\u2019s a lot of work left to do. If we make Clinton president tonight, we can expect the work of equality to continue. It\u2019s hard to know whether a vision of the first female president will help destroy bygone gender identities, or drive those who cling to them screaming into the arms of the next manifestation of Trump. What we do know is that everything from parental leave to equal pay and the right to control our own bodies will get a different treatment than they\u2019ve ever had from office of the president.</p> <p>And if we get a President Trump? It\u2019s hard to fathom just how much damage he could do. He\u2019s promised to jail his opponent and wants to \u201copen up\u201d libel laws to make it easier to sue the press. He\u2019s hinted that he won\u2019t accept the results of the election unless he wins. He\u2019s said those who get abortions should endure some form of punishment. His <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2016/03/30/politics/donald-trump-abortion-town-hall/\">walkback</a> notwithstanding, women certainly would be punished in some form or other under a Trump administration.</p> <p>Whatever happens, we shouldn\u2019t forget the trauma of the election that got us here. All the ugliness we\u2019ve seen is part and parcel of the fight to shatter that \u201chighest, hardest glass ceiling\u201d. And no matter how bad it gets, and no matter how many times we have to hear phrases like \u201cgrab them by the pussy\u201d, we know we can\u2019t plug our ears or stay quiet, because all of this would just happen again. This is the moment to speak. This is the moment to say: it stops here. </p>",
  "<p>A generation of brilliant England cricketers has been sacrificed at the altar of banter. Talk about English cricket in the 1990s and many will snigger about how relentlessly crap it was. The reality, as presented so brilliantly in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/apr/25/following-on-memoir-teenage-obsession-terrible-cricket-emma-john-review\" title=\"\">Emma John\u2019s book Following On</a> and Mark Butcher\u2019s documentary England in the 90s, was a bit more nuanced. England contributed significantly to the second golden age of Test cricket.</p> <p>There was, however, one winter where gallows humour or outright derision was the only reasonable option. On their tour of India in 1992-93, England cocked so many things up that it was hard to know whether or not they were engaged in an elaborate satire. They were thrashed in all three Tests, becoming the first touring side \u2013 in the parlance of 1993 \u2013 to be \u201cbrownwashed\u201d in India. Then, on the way home, they lost a Test to Sri Lanka for the first time.</p> <p>It was an omnifiasco, in which defeat was attributed to smog, Chinese prawns, stubble, Uzbekistani pilots, Graham Gooch\u2019s marriage and, occasionally, England\u2019s inability to bowl or play spin. Jonathan Agnew, the BBC cricket correspondent, described the tour as \u201ca shambles in every way\u201d. Even the good things that came out of it \u2013 the maiden Test centuries for Graeme Hick and Chris Lewis that seemed to be their breakthrough at the highest level \u2013 soon turned to bad. Both were dropped after two Tests of the following summer\u2019s Ashes.</p> <p>The tour is the definitive example of how a trip to the subcontinent can spiral out of control. When England flew out just after Christmas, there was plenty of optimism. \u201cCurrent form suggests they are in for a good hiding,\u201d said the Observer \u2013 but it was referring to India, who were in the middle of a stunningly boring Test series in South Africa. They had won just one out of 25 Tests, going back four years. A closer look might have dampened the optimism: 24 of those 25 Tests were away from home. The only Test in India was an innings victory over Sri Lanka in which the left-arm spinner Venkatapathy Raju took match figures of eight for 37 \u2013 from 53.5 overs.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"346ffb360411818094d8bbe9ca7dfcdea3e6cd49\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/346ffb360411818094d8bbe9ca7dfcdea3e6cd49/0_155_3900_2341/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Batsmen Sachin Tendulkar and Vinod Kambli leave the field at the end of the first Test in Calcutta, which India won by 8 wickets.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sachin Tendulkar exits the field with Vinod Kambli (centre), who Chris Lewis said he could \u2018get out any time I want\u2019.

It did not quite work out like that. Emburey and Tufnell had their spirit obliterated even before the Test series started. In the end, India\u2019s three spinners \u2013 Raju, Anil Kumble and the off-spinner Rajesh Chauhan \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bdWhb4l8g4\" title=\"\">shared 46 wickets in three Tests</a>. England\u2019s managed 17, and eight of those were taken by the part-timer Hick. No other England bowler took more than four Test wickets. After bowling a fiery spell early in the tour, Chris Lewis said of the young Indian batsman Vinod Kambli: \u201cI reckon I can get this guy out any time I want to.\u201d As Kambli moved towards a double-century in the third Test, Mike Atherton suggested that now might be an opportune time. Phil DeFreitas bowled 63 first-class overs without taking a single wicket.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2011/jul/22/joy-of-six-england-india-cricket\">The Joy of Six: England v India memories</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The man of the series was Kumble, now India\u2019s coach, playing the first home series of his legendary career. The new England coach, Keith Fletcher, scouted Kumble in South Africa, concluding that there was nothing to worry about. \u201cI didn\u2019t see him turn a single ball from leg to off,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t believe we will have much problem with him.\u201d It\u2019s one thing not to be able to read a legspinner\u2019s googly; Fletcher couldn\u2019t even read Kumble\u2019s straight one. England soon realised that wicket-to-wicket hustle was Kumble\u2019s modus operandi, and he was deadly on slow, low wickets even before DRS. In the end England had <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bdWhb4l8g4\" title=\"\">21 problems with him</a>, each at an average of 19.80.</p> <p>The misreading of Kumble was not the only bit of preparation England got wrong. They played on artificial spin mats at Lilleshall which gave the batsmen a serious challenge, and an entirely pointless one: the mats had pace and bounce and bore little resemblance to the wickets England would play on.</p> <p>Kumble had a particularly devastating impact on the Test career of the Yorkshire wicketkeeper Richard Blakey. In his only two appearances he made seven runs at an average of 1.75, and fell three times to the Kumble flipper. \u201cI remember sitting next to him on the plane home,\u201d said Tufnell later, \u201cand Richard shaking his head, saying over and over: \u2018Fucking Anil Kumble!\u2019\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"135fa2c54bb726149edbde516f1ba244d3620bae\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/135fa2c54bb726149edbde516f1ba244d3620bae/0_134_1188_1484/801.jpg\" alt=\"Phil Tuffnel gets on his bike.\" width=\"801\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Phil Tuffnel gets on his bike.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Graham Chadwick/Empics Sport</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The selection of Blakey was one of many controversies in the tour party. England omitted Jack Russell, their best wicketkeeper, and also David Gower, perhaps their best player of spin. Gower\u2019s age (35) was cited as a reason for his non\u2011selection in a squad who included Emburey (40) and Mike Gatting (35) and was captained by Gooch (39). A few days before the first Test, a few hundred MCC members debated a motion of no confidence in the selectors.</p> <p>By then Gower was in India \u2013 but only in the Sky commentary box. Ian Salisbury, another whose omission was widely criticised, was brought to India as a net bowler yet ended up playing in the first Test ahead of Emburey and Tufnell. Their morale was through the floor. Emburey was bewildered by a series of savage assaults in the warm-up games by Navjot Sidhu, an eccentric six-hitting blocker. \u201cHe is the Pink Panther to Emburey\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2012/sep/27/herbert-lom-career-clips\" title=\"\">Herbert Lom</a>,\u201d wrote Mike Atherton in his autobiography.</p> <p>Tufnell was as miserable off the field as on. \u201cI\u2019ve done the elephants and I\u2019ve done the poverty,\u201d he said towards the end. \u201cIt\u2019s time to go home.\u201d The lowest point of a troubled tour came in a match against a Rest of India XI. He hoofed his cap and rowed with the umpires after being constantly no-balled, and then laid into Blakey when he missed a chance to stump Sachin Tendulkar. Alec Stewart said Tufnell\u2019s response was \u201cunforgivable \u2013 you just don\u2019t say what he said to a team-mate\u201d. He was fined \u00a3500 after a management meeting at which those down the corridor could hear shouting and the sound of a bottle smashing.</p> <p>Both Blakey and Tufnell were left out of the first Test after England surveyed a spinners\u2019 paradise and picked four seamers. Hick took five for 28 in the match; India\u2019s slow bowlers took 17 between them. Tufnell returned for the second Test but England had to scramble around for an XI on the first morning after a number of players were taken ill. Gooch and Gatting had shared some Chinese prawns the previous night. The fact Robin Smith, who was also sick, had eaten in his hotel room and had not touched any prawns was not allowed to get in the way of a good story. Even Arthur Daley put the boot in. \u201cI mean, look at our cricket team,\u201d he said in an episode of Minder. \u201cOne man\u2019s bowl of prawns is a nation\u2019s humiliation.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8d146599790ac456e904db179eb1168914a47174\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8d146599790ac456e904db179eb1168914a47174/0_297_5359_3214/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Graham Gooch \u2018celebrates\u2019 his 100th Test match.

He played despite being ill, and was stumped after an inattentive blunder.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Patrick Eagar via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Disingenuous reporting was a theme of the tour. When Stewart and Michael Atherton, two of the contenders to succeed Gooch as captain, were involved in a run-out in the third Test, many reported it as a symbolic power struggle between two opposites who did not get on. The reality \u2013 that it was a simple mix-up, that they had enormous respect for each other and that they talked it over that night \u2013 was less interesting.</p> <p>Stewart captained England in the second Test, with the enforced absence of Gooch leading to the biggest scandal of all. The last-minute rush to find an XI meant that Stewart, the personification of sartorial smartness, had no time to put on a cricket shirt. In his first Test as England captain, he went out for the toss with a plain white T-shirt under his blazer.</p> <p>There was constant sickness among the squad. Even the scorer, Clem Driver, was taken ill, which meant Dermot Reeve\u2019s mother became England\u2019s official scorer for the rest of the tour. The sickness contributed to a collectively dishevelled appearance that drew excessive criticism. When England arrived in Calcutta, they did indeed look a complete state \u2013 as would anyone who had just departed an overnight non-sleeper train from Bhubaneshwar. \u201cNine hours in a cramped second-class sleeping compartment which for the most part shook like a fairground waltzer is no one\u2019s idea of fun,\u201d wrote David Hopps in this paper.</p> <p>Travel problems, caused by an Indian Airlines pilots\u2019 strike, compounded an already sadistic itinerary. There was a series of endless train journeys, and when they did fly, they were not in the safest hands. Some pilots were brought in from Uzbekistan and others were brought out of retirement. A few were worked into a state of threshold consciousness. \u201cOne flight into Delhi was particularly hair-raising,\u201d wrote Reeve in Winning Ways. \u201cWe came to a juddering stop just 40 yards from a fence and the copilot gasped over the intercom: \u2018Oh, it\u2019s only through the grace of God that we have landed safely, we\u2019ve had total hydraulic failure.\u2019\u201d On another flight, Agnew said he \u201chonestly thought we were all going to die\u201d. There was constant civil unrest and the first ODI was also cancelled because the safety of the players could not be guaranteed.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"1bf681c4dd223fbb1bb7406aa81e9bffb4634047\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1bf681c4dd223fbb1bb7406aa81e9bffb4634047/0_0_1257_1571/800.jpg\" alt=\"Graham Gooch does his best to relax on the sleeper train from Bhubaneshwar to Calcutta.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Graham Gooch does his best to relax on the sleeper train from Bhubaneshwar to Calcutta.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Graham Chadwick/Empics Sport</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The tour was especially miserable for Gooch. On the first day, the captain announced that his marriage had broken down. He scored what he thought was his 100th first-class hundred, only for the International Cricket Council to downgrade one of his earlier centuries. He did play his 100th Test, but was unwell throughout and was stumped in bizarre circumstances when he absent-mindedly lifted his back foot after being beaten outside off stump. Even the congratulatory silver salver from the press corps went wrong: it read: \u201cOn the occation of your 100th Test,\u201d before an S was hastily drawn on.</p> <p>Gooch missed the second Test with a prawn-related illness. Gatting played, despite being poorly, and soon wished he hadn\u2019t. He was run out when he wasn\u2019t even running, and dropped possibly the simplest catch in the history of Test cricket at silly point \u2013 one so straightforward the umpire raised his finger before the ball got to Gatting. The horror on his face as he searched desperately for the ball and his dignity is a defining image of his tour.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/that-1980s-sports-blog/2016/nov/07/england-india-1984-disarray-triumph-cricket\">England went to India in 1984 in disarray but came home with a famous victory</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It was not only the India players who taught England a lesson; the umpires did too. When Reeve was out sweeping and queried the decision, he was told: \u201cBad cricket \u2013 sweep shot not good. Play straight.\u201d For the most part England took their medicine and accepted they had been outplayed. But the chairman of selectors, Ted Dexter, unwittingly made fools of them on more than one occasion. After the first Test he announced he had commissioned a report into the impact of air pollution in Indian cities. In this paper, Hopps wrote: \u201cDexter will deservedly face accusations today that he is hiding behind a smogscreen, that the only air about last night was hot air, and that anybody seen choking was most likely choking with laughter.\u201d</p> <p>Then, when the Test and County Cricket Board reviewed the miserable tour, Dexter announced he did not like the players\u2019 scruffy appearance. \u201cWe will be looking at the whole question of facial hair,\u201d he said, a comment for which he was inevitably slaughtered. \u201cAt least,\u201d said one player, \u201cwe know we didn\u2019t lose because we played terribly.\u201d On BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme, Garry Richardson pressed Gower on whether Dexter should resign. After answering the question twice, and pointing out Dexter had not been the one bowling long hops and missing straight ones, Gower was asked it a third time. \u201cFor fuck\u2019s sake!\u201d he shouted, thinking his microphone was out of range. It wasn\u2019t.</p>",

Sanders won an astounding <a href=\"http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/was-the-democratic-primary-a-close-call-or-a-landslide/\">43%</a> of the Democratic primary votes (and <a href=\"http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-young-democrats-love-bernie-sanders/\">handily won</a> its young people), after running against the biggest family machine in Democratic politics. But he never effectively made his case to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/may/03/bernie-sanders-failure-diversity-hispanic-black-voters\">black or Hispanic voters</a>, his team wasn\u2019t ready for primetime, and he lost \u2013 though not exactly fairly and squarely. Leaked emails revealed that the Democratic National Committee was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/24/debbie-wasserman-schultz-resigns-dnc-chair-emails-sanders\">no unbiased arbiter</a> in the primary. Meanwhile Sanders was harmed by the fact that, by <a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2015/12/17/wheres-bernie-media-ignores-sanders-though-hes-more-popular-than-trump/\">some estimates</a>, Trump got 23 times the media coverage he ever did.</p> \n<p>Then, after the primary was over, the quality of discourse dropped - particularly with regard to subjects that were important to young people and people of color. If you were against Trump, the options varied between conservative and unimaginative. Gone was the spirited debate of the primary; assuming that progressives and people of color had nowhere else to go, Clinton welcomed the endorsement of neocons like John Negroponte and offered up pabulum like \u201cAmerica is great because America is good\u201d. Black Lives Matter \u2013 the most exciting movement in contemporary American politics \u2013 was never mentioned in the general debates, not even in St Louis, a few miles away from the scene of Michael Brown\u2019s killing.</p> \n<p>Many black voters, including me, came to feel the Democratic party had <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/21/hillary-clinton-black-millennial-voters\">little or nothing</a> to offer us. This is not simply because Hillary Clinton once spoke of \u201csuper-predators\u201d \u2013 a whole lotta black politicians in the 1990s voted for that crime bill, too \u2013 but because the Black Lives Matter movement has changed the conversation about respectability politics. It made us ask if black politicians, or our alleged allies, are actually helping achieve black liberation. After we went all out for Barack Obama in 2008, only to discover that having a black president didn\u2019t change how black people are disproportionately unemployed, arrested, incarcerated and killed by police, it\u2019s little wonder that early voting is down among black voters. Not only that; as Luvvie Ajayi <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/Luvvie/posts/10107001752798080\">points out</a>: \u201cThis is also the first major election since 1964 where the Voting Rights Act hasn\u2019t protected us\u201d.

When Trump called Mexicans \u201crapists\u201d and criminals, <a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/nbc-donald-trump-2015-6\">NBC cut ties with him</a> \u2013 only to <a href=\"http://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2016-election/donald-trump-hosts-saturday-night-live-amid-protests-n459341\">welcome him back to host Saturday Night Live a few months later</a>. The message was symbolic and clear: America would tolerate Trump\u2019s disdain for Mexicans if and when it seemed profitable. A handful of politicians distanced themselves from Trump\u2019s \u201cgrab them by the pussy\u201d remark and his lewd comments about a white woman. But Paul Ryan, Newt Gingrich and the entire Republican establishment embraced Trump after he demonized Hispanic people. Hillary Clinton, likely to continue the deportation policies of the Obama administration, is not offering a satisfying alternative.</p> \n<p>Native people are disillusioned, too. They are the <a href=\"http://www.democracynow.org/2016/10/19/the_police_killings_no_one_is\">most likely</a> to be killed by police and, in North Dakota, are supposed to accept <a href=\"http://www.attn.com/stories/12405/two-tweets-show-double-standard-standing-rock-debate\">having their water threatened</a> in a way the white people of Bismarck didn\u2019t.

Despite politicians talking about sustainability, climate change and the protection of the natural environment, we are actually doing little.</p> <p>We go on using finite resources, continuing to build large projects, consuming, without much regard for the ecological damage we do, the carbon we create, the indigenous habitat we lose and the destruction we cause. We really have to stop talking about the importance of the environment and act to halt the loss of the biodiversity, livability and sustainability of our planet.</p> <p>We\u2019ve lost so much forest and so many animal species through land clearing, climate change and human developments; we must preserve what wild habitat remains. We need to take a stand and say stop. Not just for the welfare and betterment of humanity and the future we pass on to our kids, but for the other creatures that inhabit the planet and the health of the earth itself.</p> <p>The ecological situation is dire. Environmental destruction is increasing pressure on many ecosystems and wild animals. Let\u2019s be the wise generation that solves these urgent problems. <br><strong>Steven Katsineris</strong><br>Hurstbridge, Victoria, Australia</p> <h2><strong>The great water folly</strong><br></h2> <p>After more than 40 years of reading the Guardian Weekly, I cannot remember an article that falls wider of the mark than Sophie Elmhirst\u2019s piece on bottled water <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/06/liquid-assets-how--business-bottled-water-went-mad\" title=\"\">(21 October)</a>. These superficially cutesy four pages of prose totally ignore the many real issues surrounding the bottled water industry.</p> <p>I live on Vancouver Island, one of the great rainforests of the world. Yet, just last year, we endured four months of water restrictions because of severe drought. A few years earlier, in Tofino, one of the wettest areas of North America, the authorities found themselves without sufficient municipal water and were forced to bring in the precious commodity on trucks.</p> <p>Farther east, in Ontario, members of a small community are fighting the giant Nestl\u00e9 apparatus in an attempt to head off plans for further expansion of a water bottling operation that already draws billions of litres from the local aquifer.</p> <p>This is the same Nestl\u00e9 whose CEO is on record as saying that public access to water is not a right, and that privatisation of the life-giving resource is the way to go. So the world ends up with mountains of plastic bottles, more fossil fuels burned to deliver them and more landfills crammed with useless garbage.</p> <p>The Guardian has done magnificent work with its Keep It in the Ground campaign, but Elmhirst\u2019s article reads more like a trade show catalogue than the kind of journalism for which this newspaper is praised. In Canada, water is becoming a serious issue; in some parts of the world it is already a matter of life and death.</p> <p>The world has indeed gone mad, but some consideration of the real issues by Elmhirst would have been welcome.<br><strong>Barry Munn</strong><br>Nanoose Bay, British Columbia, Canada</p> <p>\u2022 I find a stark contrast between the succeeding articles in your 21 October issue. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2016/oct/10/uganda-dignity-not-poverty-the-cash-grants-helping-older-generation\" title=\"\">A small price for dignity</a> discusses how elderly people in rural Ghana make wonderful use of tiny amounts of money, provided through their government\u2019s social protection programmes. The preceding article on bottled water shows there are some rich people willing to pay $100,000 for a bottle of water.</p> <p>How much better this world would be if more money was in the hands of the poor.<br><strong>Stephen Banks</strong><br>Birmingham, UK</p> <h2><strong>US undermines Venezuela</strong></h2> <p>Sending Jonathan Watts to Venezuela <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/11/venezuela-on-the-brink-a-journey-through-a-country-in-crisis\" title=\"\">(14 October)</a> to help us cut through the complexity of events in that country, seemed like a good idea. Watts\u2019 account, however, suggests that he set out in advance to lay blame squarely on the \u2018maverick\u2019 Venezuelan government. Certainly his account is one-sided, whether through political bias or ignorance.</p> <p>There are two remarkable things about the Venezuelan revolution, which Watts does not remark on. First, over the period 2000-2010, poverty was reduced by 50%, healthcare became free and of a high standard and so did education. Over the same 10 years the US, appalled by the threat to its interests in the country with the largest oil reserves on the planet, channelled more than $100m to opposition groups, with the stated objective of regime change.</p> <p>Despite extreme hardship with inflation and supplies of food and medicines, there is evidence that a large number of people, probably the majority, do not want an opposition government that promises nothing but foreign intervention and uncertainty, and that their dreams have not \u201cdried up\u201d. They are up against history, however, which tells us that socialism in one country is likely to fail, especially in a country that is so strategically important to a large capitalist neighbour.<br><strong>Mike Downham</strong><br>Strathblane, UK</p> <h2>Time to get rid of elections<br></h2> <p>Thanks to George Monbiot for bringing Christopher Achen and Larry Bartels\u2019s important work, Democracy for Realists, to a broader audience <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/04/democracy-people-power-governments-policy\" title=\"\">(14 October)</a>.

  "<p>Every evening, as twilight falls over London, sharp shafts of light will plunge down from the night sky like apocalyptic laser beams, zapping the city\u2019s bridges one by one while an ominous rumbling noise fills the air. \u201cJust as the chiming of church bells once served to gather villagers,\u201d says American architect Liz Diller, \u201cthe civic-scale lighting ceremony will celebrate a new form of urban collectivity.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"https://competitions.malcolmreading.co.uk/illuminatedriver/shortlist/synchronizing-the-city-its-natural-and-urban-rhythms\">Her proposal</a> is one of the six shortlisted schemes in the mayor of London\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2016/nov/07/six-schemes-for-lighting-up-london-bridges-shortlisted-illuminated-river\">Illuminated River</a> competition, a \u00a320m plan to bring nocturnal sparkle to the dull, grey Thames. Whittled down from 105 entries from across the world, the schemes range from connecting central London\u2019s 17 bridges with linear ribbons of light, to gently illuminating their dark vaulted underbellies with a golden glow.</p> <p>A recurring theme among the designs is an ambition to revive the natural rhythms of the river that have apparently been lost, as if Old Father Thames has somehow been suffocated by the pace of modern life. \u201cWe want to reveal the river as a breathing pulsating organism,\u201d declares <a href=\"https://competitions.malcolmreading.co.uk/illuminatedriver/shortlist/the-eternal-story-of-the-river-thames\">the entry by Amanda Levete</a>. \u201cThe river and its tidal changes remind us that our lives play out, not in the urgent context of minutes or hours but in the slower deeper context of thousands of centuries.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Eternal Story of the River Thames by AL_A, Asif Kapadia, Simon Stephens, SEAM Design, Arup, GROSS.

Whether it is advisable to call attention to the tidal detritus of shopping trolleys and swollen cadavers is moot, but there\u2019s a certain eerie charm to the scheme. As the tide rises, the lighting would shift from the underbellies of the bridges to the sides, and there is a suggestion that this \u201cmagical five-mile long cinematic experience\u201d could be \u201caccelerated for special occasions\u201d.

Composed of thin slivers of light, this rippling volume would be choreographed by live data read from the river\u2019s movement, \u201ccreating an ethereal display that ebbs and flows in register with the Thames\u201d. It\u2019s one of the more poetic of the schemes but, judging by the images, it would effectively create a wall of light between the banks of the river, obstructing the view of the city by night. As with Diller Scofidio + Renfro\u2019s armageddon show, you can imagine it would make for a fun occasional spectacle, but as a permanent feature of the night-time landscape it would grate.</p> <p>It\u2019s a feeling you get from many of the entries, that the designers have jumped at the opportunity to entertain with a ritzy night-time display, rather than quietly shed light on what is already there. Underpinning them, there appears to be a desire for the kind of novelty show embodied in <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vM59vw8KA_s\">Dubai\u2019s dancing fountains</a>, which gyrate every night beneath the Burj Khalifa to strains of Celine Dion, betraying an urge to reconfigure the city as a site of spectacular happenings with tourists in mind.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Blurring Boundaries \u2026 the proposal by David Adjaye and 16 international artists.\">  <iframe src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/189515993\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>Blurring Boundaries \u2026 the proposal by David Adjaye and 16 international artists.</figcaption> </figure>  <p>David Adjaye has hatched a cunning ruse and turned himself into the curator of his own <a href=\"https://competitions.malcolmreading.co.uk/illuminatedriver/shortlist/blurring-boundaries\">linear light gallery</a>, inviting a host of international artists to tackle each of the bridges. Chris Ofili plans to project a design of swirling, vaguely African patterns on to London Bridge, Joana Vasconcelos proposes to bolt some illuminated doilies on to Waterloo Bridge, while Cai Guo-Qiang appears to want to blow up Tower Bridge each night with a barrage of Chinese firecrackers. Adjaye, meanwhile, has carved out more of a masterplanning role, proposing to design a series of 17 pavilions alongside the bridges \u201cto enhance the curatorial vision\u201d and add more clutter to the streetscape.</p> <p>In one of the more straightforward entries, Leo Villareal (who created the Bay Lights in San Francisco) has teamed up with Lifschutz Davidson Sandilands to come up with a <a href=\"https://competitions.malcolmreading.co.uk/illuminatedriver/shortlist/current\">pulsating pastel palette of lights</a> designed to \u201cunify the bridges under a single artistic vision\u201d.

Hannah Rothschild, chair of the <a href=\"http://illuminatedriver.london/\">Illuminated River Foundation</a>, describes the Thames by night as \u201ca ribbon of darkness \u2026 at odds with the ambition to make London a 24-hour city,\u201d but that\u2019s simply not true. The river already shines with a series of conflicting colour schemes that speaks more of London\u2019s chaotic character than a curated nightly show.</p> <p>The project also raises questions about mayor Sadiq Khan\u2019s priorities for the city at a time when there is uncertainty over how long-delayed plans for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/architecture-design-blog/2014/jun/30/bridge-east-london-missing-link-transport-relaunch\">further crossings in the east of London</a> will be funded, a battle over a proposed pedestrian bridge at Nine Elms (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2015/nov/25/public-fury-as-new-bridge-across-the-thames-announced-at-nine-elms\">which only one side of the river seems to want</a>), and the previous mayor\u2019s vanity scheme for the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/jul/21/london-garden-bridge-may-need-taxpayer-bailout-once-built-report-says\">garden bridge</a> still to be properly interrogated. Khan is keen to stress that his lighting project will be privately funded (so far \u00a35m has been donated by Peter Baldwin and Lisbet Rausing through the Arcadia Fund, \u00a35m by the Rothschild Foundation and \u00a3500,000 by the City of London Corporation, leaving almost \u00a39.5m still to raise), but the garden bridge also began as a low-budget, privately funded endeavour, before it galloped out of control \u2013 and there are signs in these entries that the project will expand well beyond buying some bulbs.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p>",

  "<h2>1 | Break gender norms in childhood</h2> <p>It\u2019s important to implement gender sensitisation through education as early as primary school. Trying to bring about a change in mindset about what roles are \u201ctraditionally\u201d for women (such as care work) is crucial to creating a more open and accepting society<strong>. </strong><em>Fiza Farhan, global strategic development advisor, Lahore, Pakistan <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Fiza_Farhan\">@Fiza_Farhan</a></em></p> <h2>2 | Work with religious and traditional leaders</h2> <p>For most parts of northern Nigeria, some discriminatory norms can be tackled by the involvement of religious and traditional leaders.

When it comes to supporting lower-income women who may not have high levels of formal education, it\u2019s important to help employers realise the value of competency over credentials. Let\u2019s encourage employers to look beyond a CV (which is merely a proxy for the skills they want to hire) and instead focus on the competencies our youth posses (both men and women). This will lead to more inclusive hiring practices. <em>Noella Moshi, programmes lead, <a href=\"http://www.waveacademies.org/\">WAVE Academies</a>, Lagos, Nigeria</em></p> <p><em></em></p> <h2>4 | Pass a gender equality law</h2> <p>Legislation \u2013 such the <a href=\"http://www.womenaffairs.gov.ng/index.php/cedaw/publications/178-facts-about-the-gender-and-equal-opportunities-bill\">gender and equal opportunities bill</a> (GEOB) \u2013 would go a long way in addressing some of the discrimination that women face.

Partnerships are crucial: mobilising the skills and resources of public and private sectors creates a bigger impact than working in isolation. For example, for our <a href=\"http://www.cherieblairfoundation.org/road-to-womens-business-growth-in-nigeria/\">Road to Growth project</a>, we involved a bank in designing our training curriculum on financial literacy, and also organised events with the bank and the women entrepreneurs to build relationships.</p> <p>It\u2019s not enough to simply teach women about financial literacy; financial service providers must also offer the right kinds of products and services. And of course the right legislation is critical for women to have land rights, collaterals and access to loans. <em>Annabel Azim, enterprise development programme director, <a href=\"http://www.cherieblairfoundation.org/\">Cherie Blair Foundation for Women</a>, London, UK</em></p> <h2>6 | Recognise informal workers</h2> <p>Most of the world\u2019s poor, especially in developing countries, are working, and <a href=\"http://wiego.org/wee\">of the estimated 630 million working poor, the majority are women</a>. The primary challenge is that most of those cannot work their way out of poverty because most earn their living in the informal economy where average earnings are low while costs and risks are high.</p> <p>In Nigeria, the value of the informal economy has been estimated at <a href=\"http://www.vanguardngr.com/2013/05/n7-62trn-informal-sector-booms-in-lagos/\">7.615tn naira ($48.2bn)</a>. And yet the activities \u2013 the livelihoods \u2013 of these workers remain almost entirely unrecognised, valued or taken into account in urban planning or local economic development. If urban poverty, inequality and unemployment are to be reduced, urban informal workers, especially the working poor, need to be recognised, valued and supported as economic agents who contribute to the economy and to society. <em>Victoria Okoye, urban advocacy specialist, <a href=\"http://www.wiego.org/\">Wiego</a>, Accra, Ghana</em></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2016/oct/13/why-arent-we-designing-cities-that-work-for-women-not-just-men\">Why aren\u2019t we designing cities that work for women, not just men?</a> </p> </aside>  <h2>7 | Make travel safer for women</h2> <p>We need to integrate women more effectively through infrastructure. For instance, our <a href=\"http://wiego.org/wee\">Nigerian Infrastructure Advisory Facility</a> has connected millions of women to employment: an estimated 550,000 trips have been taken by women, facilitated through these improved transport networks. The <a href=\"http://gemsnigeria.com/gems-3/\">GEMS3</a> programme identified that women are less likely than men to travel when challenges such as bad roads prevent them from doing so. Removing obstacles to travel will have a disproportionately favourable impact on women. <em>Adanma Abalunam, project manager on the Growth and Employment in States (GEMS3) programme, <a href=\"http://www.adamsmithinternational.com/\">Adam Smith International</a>, Abuja, Nigeria</em></p> <h2>8 | End violence against women at home and work</h2> <p>I did research last year on <a href=\"http://www.nsrp-nigeria.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Masculinities-Conflict-and-Violence-web.pdf\">masculinities, conflict and violence in Nigeria</a> [pdf] that found that women\u2019s difficulties within the home increase as their earning power grows, particularly if they earn more than men. At the same time, we also need to look at violence women experience in the workplace. Most women in Nigeria I know who have set up their own business or work for a company or organisation have experienced sexual harassment. This has a detrimental impact on women\u2019s wellbeing at work as well as their motivation.</p> <p>In some cases, men often will not allow daughters, wives or sisters to work outside the home (although many still engaged in home-based businesses) \u201cfor their own protection\u201d and to guard against this violence. <em>Chitra Nagarajan, activist and writer, Maiduguri, Nigeria <a href=\"https://twitter.com/chitranagarajan\">@chitranagarajan</a></em></p> <h2>9 | Teach boys to respect women</h2> <p>There\u2019s a long-term role that parents must play in raising our sons better. I grew up believing many things to be true that I have now found to be unfavourable to the development of women and opportunities. My son, and every boy in his generation, must be educated about equality and that it is the role of any human to support another, as men must women. <em>Gbenga Sesan, executive director, <a href=\"http://www.pinigeria.org/\">Paradigm Initiative Nigeria</a>, Lagos, Nigeria <a href=\"https://twitter.com/gbengasesan\">@gbengasesan</a></em></p> <h2>10 | Use emergencies as opportunities</h2> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2016/apr/18/where-are-the-women-of-colour-in-non-profits-tech-departments\">Where are the women of colour in non-profits' tech departments?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In emergency situations, individuals often turn to opportunities for immediate economic relief where dependents have no alternative but to \u201callow\u201d women to enter the labour force. So while this may not necessarily lay the foundation for long-term change in society, organisations and the civil society need to use this situation to their advantage. Providing short vocational training for women to improve their skills and make them more favourable for employment will empower them. The government would need to implement policies and task forces to ensure that economic progress is not halted when these women return to their communities. <em tabindex=\"-1\">Fiza Farhan</em><br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <h2>11 | Look at wider inequality in Nigeria</h2> <p>In Nigeria, the gap between the rich and poor is massive and has been growing. This can be seen by the fact that even when GDP was growing, youth employment was falling. We need to look at women\u2019s economic empowerment, but we also need to look at economic inequality in Nigeria in general. We need to move away from a system of kleptocratic politicians and officials as well as rampant capitalism and its models of growth that have harmed so many women and girls and exacerbated economic inequality.

  "<p>Two stuntmen who did not know how to swim drowned after they jumped from a helicopter into a reservoir in southern India during the filming of a movie, police have said.</p> <p>The crew were shooting the climax of the film on Monday when Raghav Uday and Anil Verma jumped as part of an action sequence. Police superintendent Chandra Gupta said the two stuntmen did not know how to swim and were not wearing life vests, and that a motorboat that was supposed to rush to the scene and rescue them was found to be not working.</p> <p>Local fishermen in small boats rowed to the middle of the lake but found no trace of the two men.</p> <p>One of Kannada cinema\u2019s top actors, Duniya Vijay, also jumped into the Thippagondanahalli reservoir with the stuntmen, but managed to swim and was later rescued by a fisherman.

  "<p>Like many patient groups, the <a href=\"https://www.alzheimers.org.uk/\">Alzheimers\u2019 Society</a> isn\u2019t happy with the state of scientific research. Using donations from members of the public, it funds its own science to fill in gaps and speed up the development of treatments. </p> <p>But as well as using its members\u2019 money, the society also makes use of their expertise. The science supported by the Alzheimers\u2019 Society follows an unusual model. At every step \u2013 defining research questions, doing the research, analysing the data and measuring the impact \u2013 the patients and carers who are affected by memory loss are <a href=\"https://www.alzheimers.org.uk/researchnetwork\">involved as so-researchers</a>. </p> <p>This is a radical twist on the conventions of medical science, and it is <a href=\"http://researchinvolvement.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40900-016-0021-3?utm_content=buffer85a40&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter.com&amp;utm_campaign=buffer\">hard to get right</a>. The scientific establishment is outwardly enthusiastic about this sort of thing taking place at the margins of science. But behind the scenes fears remain that giving citizens the keys to the ivory tower is a recipe for bad science. These questions are not going away. What has come to be known as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2016/jul/03/citizen-science-how-internet-changing-amateur-research\">\u2018citizen science\u2019 is on the rise</a>.</p> <p>Citizen science was the topic of a recent seminar run by Nesta and University College London as part of a series of dialogues on responsible innovation. If we are to distinguish between <a href=\"http://www.nesta.org.uk/blog/good-and-bad-innovation-what-kind-theory-and-practice-do-we-need-distinguish-them\">good and bad innovation</a>, citizen science may help. It means different things to different people. At its broadest, we can see it as any activity where citizens are actively involved in producing knowledge. The most famous example is probably <a href=\"https://www.galaxyzoo.org/\">Galaxy Zoo</a>, which used an army of more than 100,000 volunteers to analyse pictures of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2009/jan/15/internet-astronomy\">distant galaxies</a>. That project, and citizen science in general, has diversified. Zooniverse now runs what it calls \u2018people powered research\u2019 on climate change, literature and wildlife as well as space. More than a million registered users have now signed up. </p> <p>Muki Haklay, who runs UCL\u2019s Extreme Citizen Science group, sees citizen science as an escalating set of activities from <a href=\"https://www.zooniverse.org/\">Zooniverse</a> and the <a href=\"https://ww2.rspb.org.uk/get-involved/activities/birdwatch\">Big Garden Birdwatch</a>, which has more than half a million participants, through things like <a href=\"http://www.climateprediction.net/\">climateprediction.net</a>, which asks people to donate their spare computer power, up to more specialised activities where the line between professional and amateur scientist starts to blur. <a href=\"http://www.togetherscience.eu\">Haklay\u2019s new project</a>, in which I also play a small part, is trying to better understand and maximise participation at these different levels. </p> <p>Take \u2018biohacking\u2019. Just as hobbyists in the 1980s found new uses for home computers, so amateur biohackers are now experimenting with the tools of biotechnology. Ilya Levantis is with the <a href=\"https://biohackspace.org/\">London Biohackspace</a> in Hackney. It\u2019s some distance from the professional biotech labs of London\u2019s universities and it is <a href=\"http://www.sciencefocus.com/feature/biohacking/welcome-gene-club-underground-genome-editing\">equipped with hand-me-down apparatus</a>, but the group maintains regular contact with professors. For those worried about the power of biotechnology, this may offer some reassurance. The Biohackspace has become the first community-run lab in the UK approved by the Health and Safety Executive to work with genetically modified organisms. This certification has forced these amateur biotechnologies to take on some professional responsibilities, but they have gone one step further. The Biohackspace has contributed to and signed a <a href=\"https://diybio.org/codes/draft-diybio-code-of-ethics-from-european-congress/\">DIYBio code of ethics </a>that emphasises some principles \u2013 modesty, responsibility, sharing and open access \u2013 that are in short supply in the cutthroat world of professional biotech. That said, Levantis is keen to emphasise that many of the people who come from his lab wouldn\u2019t claim to be inspired by some higher purpose. Many of them simply want to learn and play.</p> <p>For patients, especially those with rare diseases, science is a more serious business. <a href=\"https://raremark.com/\">Raremark</a> brings together people who, because of their rare diseases, may feel isolated from one another and from scientific research, which is often concentrated on high-profile conditions and blockbuster drugs. People with rare diseases and their families often know more about their illness than the doctors they meet. </p> <p>Raremark and organisations like <a href=\"https://www.patientslikeme.com/\">PatientsLikeMe</a> and <a href=\"http://www.findacure.org.uk/about-us/\">FindaCure</a>, want to speed up the process of researching and treating rare diseases, connecting expert patients with relevant researchers. In some cases, such as the patient group PXE International, such collaborations can turn families into scientists and scientists into campaigners. Sharon Terry, whose children were diagnosed with <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudoxanthoma_elasticum\">pseudoxanthoma elasticum</a> (PXE) in 1994, became a researcher and data-sharing advocate. Her name is now on more than 140 scientific papers. With her husband, she discovered the ABCC6 gene that was responsible for her children\u2019s illness. </p> <p>Aside from the enthusiasts and those who have citizen science thrust upon them, perhaps because of a rare illness or, <a href=\"http://thegovlab.org/citizen-science-and-the-flint-water-crisis/\">like the residents of Flint, Michigan</a>, because of where they live, what might citizen science mean for the rest of us? In an era of Big Data and Smart Cities, we might conclude that citizens are becoming passive contributors to knowledge rather than scientists. Perhaps our value comes from the ads we click, the apps we use and the spending habits recorded on our Clubcards, not from the questions we ask. </p> <p>Bristol City Council have been trying a different approach, redefining the idea of a smart city, which is normally driven by big technology. They asked the <a href=\"http://kwmc.org.uk/\">Knowle West Media Centre</a> and <a href=\"http://ideasforchange.com/\">Ideas for change</a> in Barcelona to come up with new ways to find out about the problems that matter to Bristolians. One project, <a href=\"http://kwmc.org.uk/projects/bristolapproach/\">Dampbusters</a>, distributes simple sensors to citizens to record levels of damp in their homes. Residents are also expected to describe any confounding factors, such as if they are hanging out washing, in order to produce reliable findings.</p> <p>Proponents of citizen science are often met with the argument that it produces poor quality data. Some university scientists might respond that their quality control isn\u2019t that great either. But this would be to miss the point that citizen science often plays by different rules \u2013 different motivations, different standards of evidence and different thresholds for action. For people in search of new treatments, clean water or political attention, the purity of a scientific laboratory may be a problem rather than an ideal. Citizen science asks us to rethink our assumptions about good science. In areas where there is a clear sense of a shared project, citizens may demand radical openness in data. For others, trust may be a problem and the sharing of information needs to be handled with great care. </p> <p>A few recent reports offer some guidance. First, researchers should be clear on what they are trying to achieve. Is their citizen science <a href=\"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1890/110278/epdf\">collaborative, co-created or merely contributory</a>? Is it about doing genuinely new science or is it about accelerating science along a trajectory already determined? Each approach demands different things of its participants and brings new responsibilities. The European Citizen Science Association (ECSA) has <a href=\"http://ecsa.citizen-science.net/engage-us/10-principles-citizen-science\">published a set of ten principles</a>. They suggest that citizens should know what is happening to their contributions, that there should be genuine scientific outcomes, and that citizen contributions should always be acknowledged (this became a problem for Galaxy Zoo, which was once unable to find a journal that would accept 100,000 authors. They had to include an appendix). </p> <p>ECSA also suggest that citizen science processes as well as outcomes should be properly evaluated, as <a href=\"https://scholar.google.co.uk/scholar?hl=en&amp;q=patientslikeme&amp;btnG=&amp;as_sdt=1%2C6&amp;as_sdtp=\">patientslikeme</a> have done, so that we learn what works. The League of European Research Universities has just <a href=\"http://www.leru.org/files/publications/LERU_AP20_citizen_science.pdf\">published its own statement</a> on citizen science, concluding that it can improve that quality and quantity of science, but that it takes time, effort and money. If we are serious about citizen science, we should a welcome its move towards the scientific mainstream. However, as well as asking how it can lead to more responsible research and innovation, we should consider what new responsibilities it demands of those taking part. </p> <p><em>With thanks to the speakers at the first responsible innovation dialogue \u2013 Muki Haklay from UCL, Julie Walters from Raremark, Martha King from Knowle West Media Centre and Ilya Levantis from London Biohackspace \u2013 and all of the attendees.

  "<p>Vulnerable pupils with challenging behaviour are being offloaded by schools that move them into inappropriate alternative settings with inexperienced staff who are not equipped to deal with them, according to the chief inspector of schools.</p> <p>Sir Michael Wilshaw, the head of the schools watchdog Ofsted, said he did not oppose the use of alternative provision \u2013 often available to pupils who are on the verge of being excluded \u2013 but called on schools to \u201ctake ownership\u201d of it. </p> <p>Ofsted fears that some pupils are being placed in unregistered or illegal schools, which are offering alternative provision that can cost \u00a325,000 a year per pupil.

We need urgent answers from the government about how they and Ofsted will be cracking down on these institutions and ensuring children with behavioural problems get the education and additional support that they need.\u201d</p> <p>There are also concerns among Ofsted inspectors about the rules governing home education. There is no legal obligation for parents to send their children to school \u2013 they can be withdrawn and registered as home educated \u2013 but they have to provide a \u201csuitable education\u201d.</p> <p>Ofsted is concerned that local authorities lack the powers to check the education being provided. Some children slip under the radar entirely as they never start school so are not registered as home educated.</p> <p>\u201cIt seems bizarre to me that a parent can simply take their child out of school and not register that child with the local authority,\u201d Wilshaw told the BBC. \u201cIt seems bizarre to me that the local authority has absolutely no powers to go and find out what\u2019s happening to children who do not go to mainstream schools, who are being educated at home.</p> <p>\u201cIt seems not just bizarre but dangerous that they cannot investigate what\u2019s happening to these children. The whole issue of home education and the very lax rules around home education need to be tightened up.\u201d</p> <p>The Department for Education has previously said steps are being taken to ensure the system is as robust as it can be when it comes to protecting young people, while at the same time safeguarding the rights of parents to determine how and where to educate their children.</p> <p>The NSPCC said on Tuesday it was concerned about the reported growth in the number of illegal schools. According to the law, anywhere that has more than five children full-time, or one child with special needs, has to register as a school.</p> <p>A spokesperson for the child protection charity said: \u201cEvery child should be safe when they go to school, and the apparent rise in these institutions which are not properly registered is very troubling.</p> <p>\u201cIllegal schools are likely to lack the vital safeguarding standards needed to protect children. They could be providing substandard education, or employing staff who haven\u2019t had the proper background checks or safeguarding training. Parents cannot be certain that these \u2018schools\u2019 have passed rigorous checks that ensure their child\u2019s safety is a top priority, making them potentially dangerous places.\u201d</p>",

Crites said his name only appeared in the leak because he was listed as a subscriber to one of Stratfor\u2019s newsletters.</p> <p>The genesis of the fake story about Crites\u2019 grandmother, and the way in which it bubbled through from blogs to a Fox News report, seemingly without any attempt at corroboration, is unclear.</p> <p>Both of Crites\u2019 grandmothers are alive, but the trail of false allegations leads to Wilda Austin, who resides at his family address.</p> <p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/WDFx2EU8/status/795267833185779713\">A Twitter user</a> first made the false connection between Crites, whom it called the \u201cTrump Reno assassin\u201d and his \u201cdead granny\u201d on Sunday afternoon.

What do these stops tell us about the race?</p> <p>Typically, last-minute campaign decisions are based on internal campaign polling not available to the public. Such polling explains why Al Gore campaigned at 2am in Florida on election day in 2000, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/stuartpstevens/status/795685460953677826\">as confusing as that move was</a> for the opposition at the time.</p> <p>The late moves of the 2016 campaign may be trickier to decode, in part because of the drunken-ninja style of the Donald Trump campaign, which <a href=\"https://twitter.com/maggieNYT/status/795722142159605760\">reportedly</a> ceased conducting its own polling last week or even two weeks ago.</p> <p>The action in Michigan, visited twice by Clinton and four times by Trump, may be most interesting. The Great Lakes state emerged as an object of interest relatively late in the race, with both campaigns having dispensed with other, more central fights, and with the Trump campaign sensing opportunity with the state\u2019s white blue-collar voters. The Clinton campaign hopes the state\u2019s Democratic voting record since 1988 will be good for 16 electoral votes Tuesday night.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/nov/07/clinton-trump-final-campaign-stops-election-what-it-means\">The last-minute map: how to read each presidential candidate\u2019s final stops</a> </p> </aside> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-58214bdae4b029b92ca467a9\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-11-08T03:56:06.278Z\">3.56am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Shares in Asian markets \u2013 where it\u2019s Tuesday already \u2013 have edged up as the prospect of a Clinton win looks more likely, Reuters reports:</p> <blockquote> <p>Most Asian stock markets rose on Tuesday ahead of the election, with investors optimistic but cautious over improving prospects for a win by Hillary Clinton.</p> <p>The Mexican peso, which strengthens as the perceived chances of an election victory by Donald Trump fall, retained its strong gains from Monday.</p> <p>The dollar, which also advanced on Monday, edged slightly lower. </p> <p>Boosting Clinton\u2019s chances of winning, and markets globally, was a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/nov/06/fbi-director-hillary-clinton-email-investigation-criminal-james-comey\">statement by the FBI on Sunday</a> standing by its July finding that Clinton was not guilty of criminal wrongdoing in her use of a private email server. </p> <p>That came after the FBI <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/28/fbi-reopens-hillary-clinton-emails-investigation\">announced on 28 October</a> it was reviewing additional emails relating to the server while Clinton was secretary of state, sending markets around the world tumbling. </p> <p>Clinton is seen by investors as offering greater certainty and stability, and, until last week\u2019s stumble, had been seen as the likely victor in Tuesday\u2019s presidential vote. </p> <p>But investors remained wary, noting Britain\u2019s shock vote in June to leave the European Union had defied most polls and bookmakers\u2019 odds. <br></p> <p>\u201cAs markets head into the U.S. election, a final recalibration of risk is in train,\u201d Michael McCarthy, chief market strategist at CMC Markets in Sydney, wrote in a note. <br></p> <p>\u201cAsia-Pacific markets were the first to adjust to the political shift, and may trade more modestly today after roaring back to life yesterday.\u201d </p> </blockquote> <p>We\u2019ll be keeping an eye on markets in Asia and beyond as the votes are totted up on Tuesday (or Wednesday as it\u2019s known in some parts of the globe).</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-58214ad7e4b029b92ca467a6\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-11-08T03:48:25.836Z\">3.48am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The Miami Herald op-ed page is keeping it simple tomorrow:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/PatriciaMazzei/status/795819819090186240\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Prediction: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/HeraldOpEd\">@HeraldOpEd</a> gonna get a *few* emails about this one.

Brady was suspended for four games at the start of the 2016 season for his role in the Deflategate scandal.<br></p> <p>Speaking in Manchester, New Hampshire, the Republican nominee told the cheering crowd that Brady called him earlier on Monday to say: \u201cDonald, I support you. You\u2019re my friend and I voted for you.\u201d</p> <p>The quarterback was photographed in 2015 with a Make America Great Again hat in his locker. Brady <a href=\"http://profootballtalk.nbcsports.com/2015/12/15/tom-brady-donald-trump-is-a-good-friend-and-i-support-my-friends/\">also said</a> in an interview in December 2015: \u201cDonald is a good friend of mine.

The famously taciturn and obsessive coach has won four Super Bowls with Brady as his quarterback and is considered one of the greatest coaches in NFL history. Belichick\u2019s girlfriend <a href=\"http://www.foxsports.com/nfl/story/bill-belichick-donald-trump-new-england-patriots-presidential-candidate-030616\">posted a picture</a> on Instagram of Trump and the NFL coach in the spring, describing the Republican nominee as \u201cour good friend\u201d.</p> <p>Trump announced after the Brady endorsement that Belichick \u201cwrote me the most beautiful letter\u201d:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Congratulations on a tremendous campaign. You have dealt with an unbelievable slanted and negative media and come out beautifully. You have proved to be the ultimate competitor and fighter.

The judge slammed the local Democratic party for \u201cbelated, inflammatory allegations<strong> </strong>that<strong> </strong>appear intended to generate only heat, not light\u201d.</p> <p>The supreme court on Monday also denied a request to restore a sweeping temporary restraining order issued by a federal judge in Ohio last week, which had briefly enjoined the Trump campaign, Stone, and Stop the Steal, as well as the Clinton campaign, from engaging in a variety of voter intimidation behaviors.

The familiar syntax was not lost on us Latinos, who have been told to \u201cgo back\u201d for as long as we\u2019ve been in the United States, whether we were born here or not.</p> <p>Before he was forcibly removed, Ramos was criticizing Trump for effectively saying he would deport 11 million undocumented people and build a 1,900-mile border wall. Well, Trump skirted those specifics, but that was the reality of what he was proposing. We Latinos were put in a familiar place \u2013 where we are merely numbers or parasites to the economy, seen not for our worth as human beings but for our worth as laborers.</p> <p><em>Al mal tiempo, buena cara, </em>goes an old Mexican proverb. \u201cTo the bad times, good face.\u201d When I first delved into the world of activism, I used to hold the saying in contempt. It seemed to feed into the bottomless humility of the Mexican American in the face of oppression, the immigrant family, the Chicano who doesn\u2019t want to make a fuss. It painted us, I thought, as a people who merely stood by while bad things happened to us.</p> <p>Watching the Trump campaign, being its first scapegoats, I felt we were in that helpless place where our only option was to endure. The slogan Make America Great Again encapsulated exactly how we are seen in this country. We are the unclean other, our culture dilutes the purity of America\u2019s white citizens who must be protected from us. Make America great again \u2013 by kicking us out.</p> <p>Violence <a href=\"http://americasvoice.org/trumphatemap/\">against Latinos surged</a>, at Trump rallies and across the country. Xenophobia and racism were whipped into a fever pitch by the demagogue\u2019s rants, his constant attacks on our families and our neighbors. \u201cSend them back\u201d was a phrase I heard more in those months than I ever had in my life. \u201cYou have to go back\u201d became a common response to everything I wrote. Something had changed.</p> <p>It was Trump\u2019s attack on US district court judge Gonzalo P Curiel, born in Indiana and of Mexican descent, that saw our worst fears begin to take shape in reality.

They are, in fact, widespread and even predicted by some local officials.</p> <p>Since 2000, the popularity of early voting has increased from 12% of the electorate to an anticipated 40% this year, according to a <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/news/early-voting-2016-election/\">CBS report of the AP Election Research Group</a>. During that same time though, <a href=\"http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/americans-love-early-voting-and-it-might-help-clinton/\">Republican-led</a> legislatures have pushed back against early voting in Ohio, Arizona and Nebraska. </p> <p>Why?</p> <p>In-person early voting tends to benefit Democrats. In North Carolina, for example, 60% of black voters \u2013 a reliably Democratic group \u2013 cast early ballots, as opposed to 44% of white voters, according to the <a href=\"https://www.facingsouth.org/2016/09/why-early-voting-matters\">Institute for Southern Studies</a>.</p> <p>Following the <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/26/us/supreme-court-ruling.html\">US Supreme Court\u2019s dismantling</a> of the Voting Rights Act, which required some southern states to get pre-approval of election law changes from the federal government, North Carolinian state representatives passed a law that <a href=\"http://www.slate.com/blogs/the_slatest/2016/07/29/fourth_circuit_strikes_down_north_carolina_voting_restrictions.html\">eliminated early voting on one Sunday</a>. In part, that move was designed to impact \u201csouls to the polls\u201d day, a powerful program that brings black churchgoers to vote after Sunday service.</p> <p>A judge struck down that state law in July, finding that it targeted African Americans \u201c<a href=\"http://www.slate.com/blogs/the_slatest/2016/07/29/fourth_circuit_strikes_down_north_carolina_voting_restrictions.html\">with almost surgical precision</a>\u201d. Nevertheless, <a href=\"https://www.facingsouth.org/2016/09/why-early-voting-matters\">three North Carolina counties</a> still managed to limit early voting the Sunday before election day.</p> <p>Research from the Brennan Center for Justice on three states with the longest lines in 2012, Florida, Maryland and South Carolina, found that voters in urban areas tended to have fewer machines, less poll workers or both. More research cited by the center backs up findings that voters in <a href=\"http://www.pewhispanic.org/2016/10/11/democrats-maintain-edge-as-party-more-concerned-for-latinos-but-views-similar-to-2012/\">Latino</a> and African American districts tend to wait the longest (both constituencies lean Democratic).</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e9e33d07f2741447a79ff6aa2b190503a8dc2a67\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e9e33d07f2741447a79ff6aa2b190503a8dc2a67/0_365_5472_3283/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A line of early voters waits outside the Franklin County Board of Elections, Monday, Nov. 7, 2016, in Columbus, Ohio.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A line of early voters waits outside the Franklin County Board of Elections, Monday, Nov. 7, 2016, in Columbus, Ohio.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: John Minchillo/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Just this spring, lines were so long in Arizona that voters of both parties were <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/2016/03/25/471891525/arizona-polling-places-overwhelmed-with-long-lines-on-primary-day\">livid</a>. Why? Republican state officials cut budgets for county officials, who in turn demanded cheap elections, which cut polling places. Democratic leaders tended to blame Republicans, who cut budgets. Arizona was another state that used to be required to seek pre-approval of election law changes under the Voting Rights Act.</p> <p>If politicians wanted to end long lines, experts say some simple recommendations could make a big impact. A January 2014 report called The American Voting Experience looked at ways that officials could predict and plan for voter turnout, after Floridians waited <a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2012/11/no-one-in-america-should-have-to-wait-7-hours-to-vote/264506/\">seven hours</a> to vote for Barack Obama in 2012.</p> <p>They found that expanding early voting, online registration, new technologies and efficient polling place management could all help reduce and eliminate long wait times. </p> <p>So if you\u2019re waiting in a long line, congratulate your fellow voters, and consider a letter to you local election commission. </p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5820cee2e4b07ceadb3a34c6\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-11-07T19:00:40.062Z\">7.00pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Obama picks up on report that aides confiscated Trump's Twitter</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Don\u2019t miss this from the New York Times: <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/07/us/politics/donald-trump-presidential-race.html\">Inside Donald Trump\u2019s Last Stand: An Anxious Nominee Seeks Assurance</a>. <br></p> <p>Among the juicy details: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Aides to Mr. Trump have finally wrested away <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/\">the Twitter account</a> that he used to colorfully \u2014 and often counterproductively \u2014 savage his rivals.

It was about whether a woman could be the president of the US.</p> <p>How did it even start? I was no <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/feminism\">feminist</a> prodigy, just a shy kid who preferred reading to talking; politics weren\u2019t my destiny. Probably, I was trying to work out what was possible for my category of person \u2013 legally, logistically \u2013 as one might ask which kinds of terrain are navigable for a newly purchased bicycle. Up until then, gender hadn\u2019t darkened my mental doorway as I followed my older brother into our daily adventures wearing hand-me-down jeans.</p> <p>But in adolescence it dawned on me I\u2019d be spending my future as a woman, and when I looked around, alarm bells rang. My mother was a capable, intelligent, deeply unhappy woman who aspired to fulfilment as a housewife but clearly disliked the job. I saw most of my friends\u2019 mothers packed into that same dreary boat. My father was a country physician, admired and rewarded for work he loved. In my primordial search for a life coach, he was the natural choice.</p> <p>I probably started by asking him if girls could go to college, have jobs, be doctors, tentatively working my way up the ladder. His answers grew more equivocal until finally we faced off, Dad saying, \u201cNo\u201d and me saying, \u201cBut why not?\u201d A female president would be dangerous. His reasons vaguely referenced menstruation and emotional instability, innate female attraction to maternity and aversion to power, and a general implied ickyness that was beneath polite conversation.</p> <p>I ended that evening curled in bed with my fingernails digging into my palms and a silent howl tearing through me that lasted hours and left me numb. The next day I saw life at a remove, as if my skull had been jarred. What changed for me was not a dashing of specific hopes, but an understanding of what my father \u2013 the person whose respect I craved \u2013 really saw when he looked at me. I was tainted. I would grow up to be a lesser person, confined to an obliquely shameful life.</p> </blockquote> <p>Read the full piece here:</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/nov/06/hillary-clinton-white-house-donald-trump-bullying-barbara-kingsolver\">End this misogynistic horror show.

(In 2012, the state did not report results until four days after election day.)</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/ForecasterEnten/status/794215432135864320\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Giving the high early vote totals in both FL and NC, we&#39;re going to know fairly early on whether Clinton has won or Trump still has a shot.</p>&mdash; (((Harry Enten))) (@ForecasterEnten) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ForecasterEnten/status/794215432135864320\">November 3, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>Steve Schale is a Democratic analyst who ran Florida operations for Obama in 2008. He<strong> <a href=\"http://steveschale.com/\">sees low-propensity Hispanic voters</a> </strong>\u2013 meaning voters who weren\u2019t judged especially likely to turn out \u2013 <strong>pushing the election in Clinton\u2019s direction:</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>But two things emerged last week. One, this low propensity Hispanic thing became a thing. While Trump folks argued that Trump would turn out low propensity voters, we\u2019d see slight edges for Democrats in this category. What became clear over days last week, this was a Hispanic deal, and as week 2 of early voting took hold, so did this surge. As of Saturday, Democrats had an edge of more than 175K low propensity voters.</p> </blockquote> <p>Schale also sees <a href=\"http://steveschale.com/\">serious strength</a> for <strong>Clinton in Miami-Dade:</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Dade is at 11.9% of all votes cast so far (should be 10.3%), and Broward is at 9.55%, where I had it pegged at 8.75%. The media market is a full two points bigger than it should be. If the Miami market finishes at 21.8% of all votes, this thing is cooked, and we will know it before 8:00 (assuming Miami decides to count all these ballots)</p> </blockquote> <p>Schale sees <strong>Clinton \u201cunder-performing\u201d in Palm Beach county,</strong> two counties north of Miami:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The red flag for Dems: Palm Beach. It is at 62% of its 2012 total, and it is also the county most \u201cunder-performing.\u201d It should be about 7% of the state vote, but today it is about 5.9%. Of all the data points right now, this is the only one that concerns me. While Miami is more than making up for it, for HRC, win path is much easier with a more robust Palm Beach.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9a51b3fa0aebea1a11c2e7e8618af8dd2a7fb7f4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9a51b3fa0aebea1a11c2e7e8618af8dd2a7fb7f4/0_0_3500_2099/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Recording artist Stevie Wonder performing prior to President Obama coming on stage at a Clinton rally at Osceola County Stadium, Kissimmee, Florida, November 6, 2016.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Recording artist Stevie Wonder performing prior to President Obama coming on stage at a Clinton rally at Osceola County Stadium, Kissimmee, Florida, November 6, 2016.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: UPI / Barcroft Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><a href=\"http://steveschale.com/\">Here\u2019s Schales conclusion:</a></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I am going to write a wrap tomorrow for E-Day, but two questions I get a lot.</p> <p>What am I worried about for HRC?</p> <p>Really, almost nothing. I\u2019ve mentioned the Palm Beach thing a few times, but right now, the diversity mix is rounding nicely into shape, and our best counties are way out-performing the state. Right now, she needs the organization on the ground to get this done on Tuesday</p> <p>Could there be a Trump surge on Tuesday? It is possible, because the counties most under-performing right now are Trump counties. His problem, most of them are very small, part of what Jonathan Martin called the Gingrich Counties (where Newt beat Romney)-- those rural places in-between all the big counties.</p> <p>All in all, the I-10 markets are way below where they should be, maybe as much as 3% below where its share should be. If that comes in tomorrow, it will tighten the race considerably.</p> <p>Tomorrow\u2019s memo will also lay out some things you watch for. If she wins by 3, we will know pretty well, probably before the Panhandle returns come back after 8. If it is close, prepare for a long night.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-58209c4ce4b07ceadb3a33c3\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-11-07T15:26:50.731Z\">3.26pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>She was 9 or 10 years old (depending on whether she falls in Aquarius-Leo or in Virgo-Capricorn) when the 19th amendment giving women the right to vote was ratified. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/1199SEIUFlorida/status/795367927285485569\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Desiline Victor, at 106 years old, is the oldest voter in <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/MiamiDade?src=hash\">#MiamiDade</a> arrives at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/NorthMiami?src=hash\">#NorthMiami</a> to cast her vote <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/WeCareWeVote?src=hash\">#WeCareWeVote</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/MobilizeFlorida?src=hash\">#MobilizeFlorida</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/PfPo7aeGRx\">pic.twitter.com/PfPo7aeGRx</a></p>&mdash; 1199SEIUFlorida (@1199SEIUFlorida) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/1199SEIUFlorida/status/795367927285485569\">November 6, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-58209ab8e4b029b92ca464f6\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-11-07T15:18:06.012Z\">3.18pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Hi Grandma, what are you doing today? </p> <p>Hillary Clinton has a granddaughter who just turned two, and a grandson who\u2019s five months. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"clinton\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;instagram-media&quot; data-instgrm-captioned data-instgrm-version=&quot;7&quot; style=&quot; background:#FFF; border:0; border-radius:3px; box-shadow:0 0 1px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.5),0 1px 10px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.15); margin: 1px; max-width:658px; padding:0; width:99.375%; width:-webkit-calc(100% - 2px); width:calc(100% - 2px);&quot;&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;padding:8px;&quot;&gt; &lt;div style=&quot; background:#F8F8F8; line-height:0; margin-top:40px; padding:58.9932126697% 0; text-align:center; width:100%;&quot;&gt; &lt;div style=&quot; background:url(data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAACwAAAAsCAMAAAApWqozAAAABGdBTUEAALGPC/xhBQAAAAFzUkdCAK7OHOkAAAAMUExURczMzPf399fX1+bm5mzY9AMAAADiSURBVDjLvZXbEsMgCES5/P8/t9FuRVCRmU73JWlzosgSIIZURCjo/ad+EQJJB4Hv8BFt+IDpQoCx1wjOSBFhh2XssxEIYn3ulI/6MNReE07UIWJEv8UEOWDS88LY97kqyTliJKKtuYBbruAyVh5wOHiXmpi5we58Ek028czwyuQdLKPG1Bkb4NnM+VeAnfHqn1k4+GPT6uGQcvu2h2OVuIf/gWUFyy8OWEpdyZSa3aVCqpVoVvzZZ2VTnn2wU8qzVjDDetO90GSy9mVLqtgYSy231MxrY6I2gGqjrTY0L8fxCxfCBbhWrsYYAAAAAElFTkSuQmCC); display:block; height:44px; margin:0 auto -44px; position:relative; top:-22px; width:44px;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p style=&quot; margin:8px 0 0 0; padding:0 4px;&quot;&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.instagram.com/p/BMg3PI8AH2J/&quot; style=&quot; color:#000; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; line-height:17px; text-decoration:none; word-wrap:break-word;&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Hillary Clinton Facetimes with her granddaughter Charlotte on final morning of the campaign trail.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style=&quot; color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px; margin-bottom:0; margin-top:8px; overflow:hidden; padding:8px 0 7px; text-align:center; text-overflow:ellipsis; white-space:nowrap;&quot;&gt;A photo posted by Sabrina Siddiqui (@sabrinasiddiqui) on &lt;time style=&quot; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px;&quot; datetime=&quot;2016-11-07T15:11:20+00:00&quot;&gt;Nov 7, 2016 at 7:11am PST&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;script async defer src=&quot;//platform.instagram.com/en_US/embeds.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-58209989e4b07ceadb3a33b1\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-11-07T15:14:43.720Z\">3.14pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Philly transit strike ends</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>If voters in Philadelphia, prime Democratic territory, don\u2019t turn up at the polls tomorrow, they will not have a weeklong public transit strike to blame.

  "<p>To become the 45th president of the United States, Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump has to win 270 electoral college votes. The candidates have spent what feels like 100 years locked in mortal combat, but in the next few hours there will finally be a victor. (Well, probably. If there\u2019s a 269-vote tie, or a mandatory recount, prepare for constitutional chaos.)</p> <h2>So remind me how the electoral college works again? </h2> <p>Each state is assigned a certain number of electoral votes, ultimately based on its population. California has the most, with 55. Seven states \u2013 Alaska, Delaware, Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota, Vermont and Wyoming \u2013 have just three electoral votes. Washington DC gets three too.</p> <p>While there are 50 states in the US, most of these are \u201csafely\u201d Republican or Democrat. They vote the same way every time going back at least six elections. So the presidential election boils down to just a handful of \u201cswing states\u201d \u2013 the 10 or 11 states that have a recent history of selecting both Republicans and Democrats. </p> <p>This is why voters in places such as Ohio, Florida, Iowa, North Carolina, Virginia, Nevada, Colorado and New Hampshire are subjected to a barrage of television advertising and campaign stops. It\u2019s also why you have not seen Clinton and Trump holding rallies in Louisiana (safely Republican) or Washington (safely Democratic).</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/oct/31/how-does-electoral-college-work-us-election-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/59yvc\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2849673\"            data-video-name=\"How does the US electoral college work? \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"Guardian/Getty Images\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-58136bc4e4b08d944ba4ba7a\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/10/28/161028elect1_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/10/28/161028elect1.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/10/28/161028elect1_WebM.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/oct/31/how-does-electoral-college-work-us-election-video\">How does the US electoral college work?</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>Trump faces a much more difficult path to victory. He needs to win almost all of these swing states to become the next president, whereas if Clinton wins two or three, she wins the race. </p> <p>This is because Democrats start from a stronger position. There are 18 states plus DC that have voted for a Democrat for president in every election since 1992. That batch amounts to 242 electoral votes. There are only 13 states that have voted for a Republican in every election since 1992. Those states carry just 102 electoral votes.</p> <p>If Clinton simply wins all the states that have voted for her predecessors in the recent past, then adds Florida (which has 29 electoral votes), she is the next president. If she loses Florida but wins, say, Virginia and North Carolina, she will be the next president.</p> <p>Trump needs to hold on to all the historically Republican states, win states such as Georgia and Arizona \u2013 which are usually Republican but where he has struggled in the polls \u2013 and then win enough swing states to tip him over 270.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2016/11/poll-closings/\" data-alt=\"Poll closing times\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2016/11/poll-closings/\">Poll closing times</a> </figure>  <p><em>(For our international readers following along across Europe and beyond, a little light math for you ... in the UK, Ireland, Iceland and Portugal, add five hours to ET; anywhere else from Poland west, add six hours; in eastern Europe, add seven hours; Australia add 16 hours; and so on.) </em></p> <h2>6pm ET (5pm CT, 4pm MT, 3pm PT, 11pm GMT) \u2013 let\u2019s go!<br></h2> <p>Buckle in because now the real fun begins: polls close in eastern Kentucky and most of Indiana.

He didn\u2019t.</p> <h2>7pm ET (6pm CT, 5pm MT, 4pm PT, 12am GMT)</h2> <p>Voting ends in three key swing states: Virginia, Florida and New Hampshire (where a minimal number of polling stations may stay open until 8pm ET).<br></p> <p>Florida\u2019s 29 electoral college <a href=\" http://dos.myflorida.com/elections/for-voters/voting/election-day-voting/\">votes</a> have proved crucial in the recent past. Al Gore can tell you that. He narrowly lost the state \u2013 some still believe he actually won \u2013 and the election to George W Bush, despite winning the national popular vote. </p> <p>Away from the top of the ticket, Florida senator and one-time Republican presidential candidate Marco Rubio is up for re-election. He has been running a bit ahead of Democrat Patrick Murphy in the polls. Debbie Wasserman-Schultz, who resigned as chair of the Democratic National Committee in July after leaked emails showed the party favoring Clinton\u2019s campaign, is expected to comfortably win re-election to Congress.</p> <p>Virginia was a reliably Republican state until Obama won there in 2008 and again in 2012. The state\u2019s mix of less-educated, rural voters; wealthy suburbanites; federal government employees and military families; academics; jet-setters and so on make it difficult to read, but Clinton has been decisively ahead this year. </p> <p>New Hampshire has been won by a Democrat in five of the past six presidential elections. But the Granite State gave Trump his first big primary win, and recent polling here has shown a tight race.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"d26348a1118b4b39b2fd0263b5f76c785aaa2311\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d26348a1118b4b39b2fd0263b5f76c785aaa2311/0_0_1472_5321/277.png\" alt=\"Spicy Hot Sauce\" width=\"277\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Spice things up</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Erickson Photography/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Other states closing at 7pm ET include South Carolina and Vermont \u2013 Bernie Sanders\u2019 home state.

Expect the result from West Virginia very quickly \u2013 Trump should win easily. </p> <p>North Carolina and Ohio are swing states and will take longer. Ohio has been seen as a reliable bellwether state, voting for the presidential winner in every election since 1964.

It has voted for the winner of every presidential election in 30 of the past 32 elections \u2013 dating back to 1888. Keep an eye out for its result.</p> <p>A big swing state closes its polls at 8pm: Pennsylvania.</p> <p>Republicans have long dreamed of winning Pennsylvania\u2019s 20 electoral college votes, based on growing support among once flourishing manufacturing and mining sectors in the south-western and north-eastern corners of the state. But Clinton has been creaming Trump in polls in Philadelphia and its suburbs, which is where most of the people live, and she has been comfortably ahead in statewide polls for months. </p> <p>Pennsylvania will also be under scrutiny on election day because of Trump\u2019s controversial <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/16/donald-trump-rigged-election-poll-giuliani-gingrich-pence\">claims</a> that there has been voter fraud in Philadelphia in the past and his calls for \u201cvolunteer election monitors\u201d.</p> <p>The results in non-swing states will start to come in thick and fast.

In the 2012 election, Mitt Romney was declared the winner just before 8.30pm. A Democratic candidate hasn\u2019t won in Georgia since proper southern boy Bill Clinton in 1992, but strong support for Hillary Clinton in Georgia counties with a high African American population, and in Atlanta, have made her a threat to Trump. </p> <p>If Clinton wins Georgia, Trump might as well concede.

Barring an almighty upset, Clinton will quickly be declared the winner.</p> <p>Wyoming, Louisiana, North and South Dakota, Kansas and Texas all close at 9pm too. The networks should swiftly call these for Trump \u2026 unless loose talk of Clinton taking Texas, which last went Democratic in the Watergate era, comes true?

The New Hampshire result should also come in around this time. They will offer one of the first concrete indications of how the night is going.</p> <p>Nevada and Iowa are the final swing states to close their polls. In the past two elections, Iowa was called quickly for Obama. Montana and Utah also close at 10pm; both are traditionally safe Republican states, but Trump\u2019s unpopularity means <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2016-10-24/mormon-support-could-push-mcmullin-over-the-top-in-utah\">independent Evan McMullin</a>, who\u2019s from Utah, has a strong chance of becoming the first non-Republican or Democrat to win electoral college votes since 1968. </p> <p>Utah has been called soon after the polls close in the recent past. If McMullin is declared the winner, it\u2019s a good sign that the night is truly in uncharted territory, terra incognita, in the most exciting way.

These are all safe Democrat states that are unlikely to unexpectedly impact the outcome. </p> <p>Back in 2012, the Associated Press called the swing states of Colorado, Iowa, North Carolina and Ohio \u2013 worth a combined 48 electoral votes \u2013 in the space of 30 minutes at around 11pm, then declared Obama\u2019s re-election at 11.38pm. </p> <p>In 2008, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73ksUPU0Nbo\">networks announced</a> Obama had won just after 11pm.</p> <p>We might know the outcome sooner this time. Or we might not know for a while.</p> <p>If Clinton\u2019s lead in opinion polls translates to the actual polls, then we may see states called for her earlier, on the back of strong early voting results. If enough swing states are called quickly, we could find out the result before 11pm ET. Or, if Trump proves the polls wrong, the race could as quickly run to him.</p> <p>Separately, there are some individual states to look out for.</p> <p>Ohio is one. Some polling experts believe that if Trump doesn\u2019t win there, it is effectively game over. <a href=\"http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/if-trump-wins-heres-how-the-map-might-look/?ex_cid=538twitter\">Fivethirtyeight.com gave him</a> less than a 1% chance of winning the presidency if he fails to take the Buckeye State.</p> <p>Likewise, if Trump loses North Carolina or Pennsylvania or Florida, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/most-routes-to-270-blocked-for-trump-needs-last-ditch-surge/2016/10/30/b3cf409a-9ede-11e6-8864-6f892cad0865_story.html\">it also becomes very difficult</a> for him to win.</p> <p>And beyond that, if Clinton can win Georgia \u2013 remember, these are usually solidly Republican \u2013 it would suggest she is in for a blowout victory that could see the election called for her very early.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"100102cda2684f749441d7cb80e7b29f4e29d579\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/100102cda2684f749441d7cb80e7b29f4e29d579/0_0_1197_3576/335.png\" alt=\"Queen Latifah\" width=\"335\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Queen Latifah</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andrew Toth/FilmMagic</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In 2012, Virginia was only called for Obama after midnight and Florida was not called for four days. Clinton is polling well ahead of Trump in Virginia, and strong early voting results might see her announced the winner early.</p> <p><strong>Election soundtrack: </strong>Queen Latifah, U-N-I-T-Y. We may see the first female president, following a campaign marked by sexism and inappropriate behaviour towards women. Queen Latifah called out the disrespectful treatment of women in this 1994 hit.</p> <p><strong>Election fuel: </strong><a href=\"http://www.chowhound.com/recipes/cuban-sandwiches-30428\">Cuban sandwich</a>. Florida\u2019s signature dish is said to have originated in Cuba or in Key West, part of the Florida Keys archipelago. It\u2019s got ham, swiss cheese, mustard and pickles in it, and might be a good way to soak up the booze.</p> <h2>Time for the the speeches?</h2> <p>In the early hours, we would expect a victory speech and a concession speech \u2013though Trump has spoken of a threat that the election could be rigged and refused to say that if he loses he will accept the result. </p> <p>If elected, Clinton would be the first woman to be elected US president. She has <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/hillary-clinton-glass-ceiling_us_579827fee4b0d3568f85272e\">repeatedly spoken</a> about breaking the \u201cglass ceiling\u201d in politics, and has chosen to hold her election night party at New York City\u2019s Javits Center, which <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2016/10/26/politics/hillary-clinton-election-night-javits-center-irpt/\">actually has a glass ceiling</a>.</p> <p>If Trump is elected, he will be the first person with his own vodka line to be elected president, and <a href=\"http://thehill.com/blogs/pundits-blog/presidential-campaign/252557-how-often-do-americans-elect-political-outsiders-to\">only the fifth</a> president to have never held elected office. </p> <p>The winner will have 73 days to set up a new government before they are sworn into office on 20 January 2017.</p> <p>But if you\u2019re concerned about post-election withdrawal symptoms, don\u2019t worry: the midterm elections, sometimes seen as a referendum on the president, will take place in November 2018. All 435 members of the House of Representatives will be up for re-election, along with a third of the Senate and more than half the governors.</p> <p>And then, in summer 2019, a whole new cast of hopefuls will announce their presidential campaigns, and the whole thing starts over again.

  "<p>In the moments that Infinite Warfare has the courage of its convictions, when its various systems sync-up sufficiently, we get a tantalising taste of its true potential.</p> <p>These moments usually come when the protagonist, Nick Reyes, leaves terra firma and zips about in zero-gravity, course-correcting with boosters and engaging enemy soldiers against the backdrop of gargantuan spaceships smashing into one another. In between precision shots from his Ghostbusters-like energy weapon, he grapples on to a grunt and pulls the pin on his grenade before kicking him towards two buddies, who look on helplessly as he greets them with an explosion. That taken care of, Reyes grapples to his waiting Jackal space fighter and boosts off to begin dogfighting with enemy craft. </p> <p>Needless to say, Call of Duty\u2019s production values ensure such episodes look spectacular. They may not be perfect in execution \u2013 rotation can become disorientating and enemy AI remains erratic \u2013 but they at least attempt to jolt this long-running series off its sometimes derided rails. Disappointingly though, Infinity Ward\u2019s latest offering is mostly the familiar CoD routine of boots-on-the-ground combat in long corridors of choreographed action. It\u2019s just that here, those boots are rocket-boosted and wall-run-capable. Even this concept is a pale imitation of Titanfall at its finest, boasting similar fundamentals but not the conviction to make them integral. While traversing these familiar sci-fi environments \u2013 futuristic cityscape, ice planet, rock planet, space station \u2013 parkour is mostly unnecessary.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"766a8f0af0e9fdb986a0f00af8de02120ce8d85a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/766a8f0af0e9fdb986a0f00af8de02120ce8d85a/242_0_3598_2160/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Developer Infinity Ward really wants us to care about its characters but doesn\u2019t give us enough narrative ammo\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Developer Infinity Ward really wants us to care about its characters but doesn\u2019t give us enough narrative ammo</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Activision</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The old problem of this game\u2019s key narrative delivery technique remains: you have to follow computer-controlled characters who yell orders and exposition at you, but often they move too slow and it gets frustrating \u2013 like attempting to navigate Oxford Street on a particularly chaotic festive shopping day. The sheer number of times the game strips control away from you remains extraordinary \u2013 after a while, even the most impressive cinematic moments become a deadening intrusion. The first time you\u2019re blasted out of an airlock it\u2019s inarguably impressive and it even feels appropriate that you\u2019re helpless. The second time is simply irritating. The third time, you just want to drift away forever like Frank Poole in 2001: A Space Odyssey. </p> <p>But even in space, you lack freedom. Attempts to flank the enemy are thwarted by a curt prompt to return to the \u201ccombat zone\u201d or be booted. The space craft combat sequences are a mess. The physics lack heft and movement feels erratic. Opposing fighters are simple to lock on to but the game then wrests control away to track them. Occasionally, when you kill an enemy, a playing card will pop up to tell you he was a big cheese (in an imitation of the American ploy towards rogue Ba\u2019athists in 2003), but since you only find this out after killing them it renders the whole scheme somewhat pointless. You shot them just the same as all the others; that\u2019s all you do in CoD.</p> <p>Much is made of the fact you\u2019re a captain but you can\u2019t issue orders in the field and, despite a Mass Effect-like galaxy map to navigate on your ship\u2019s bridge, you cannot shape the campaign\u2019s outcome. You can select two types of side-mission \u2013 ship-infiltration or ship-to-ship combat \u2013 but the benefit of them is merely upgraded equipment. It\u2019s certainly no Mass Effect in this respect \u2013 and while that comparison is harsh, it\u2019s conditioned by the developer\u2019s flagrant desire for you to care about your mission and crew; the message about prioritising one over the other crowbarred into every conversation.</p> <p>The setting at least allows the game to sidestep CoD\u2019s traditionally problematic politics, even if the opening sneak-attack on Geneva subtly nods towards Pearl Harbour and 9/11. Not being offensive shouldn\u2019t be praiseworthy, however, and the Martian secessionists led by Salen Kotch (a space-scenery-chewing Kit Harington) are so comically evil, and your means for defeating them so silly, they undermine any questions about military service the game attempts to tackle.</p> <p>The defeat of the villain is woefully anticlimactic, whereas the finale has dramatic deaths for minor crew members you\u2019d barely noticed hitherto. While the credits roll you can listen to letters from the fallen, meant to sum up the series\u2019 earnest move away from \u201cpress x to show respects\u201d miss-steps. Instead, they bring to mind the deliberately ridiculous barbecue dream of BJ Blazkowicz in the last Wolfenstein. The characters here lack the script to justify you caring. The damning irony is only wisecracking robot Ethan sounds remotely human.</p> <p>For all these flaws, CoD\u2019s core shooting mechanics, refined over countless iterations, still make for a fine corridor and multiplayer shooter. Every weapon comes with alternative fire modes and being creative in your kills is part of the appeal. Innovations such as anti-grav grenades and spider bots (which scuttle over to enemies before discharging) spice things up, not least when they\u2019re deployed against you. One of the most enjoyable new tactics in the campaign is the ability to take direct control of enemy bots by hacking them, unleashing rounds on their bewildered allies before detonating to take as many with you as you can.</p> <p>After completing the game, you can replay the whole thing in modes like Yolo, which offers a challenging permadeath mechanic that encourages a whole different approach (ie a lot of hiding).</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3a3f272c412c77bddbbfe203e9ff0ef2d6e6e3e8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3a3f272c412c77bddbbfe203e9ff0ef2d6e6e3e8/0_0_3598_2160/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Infinite Warfare really comes into its own as a multiplayer experience\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Infinite Warfare really comes into its own as a multiplayer experience</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Activision</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The online multiplayer modes are the best thing. The campaign\u2019s traversal mechanics come out of hiding and the wealth of options become apparent. Whether you\u2019re angling for nuts and bolts deathmatch on a lunch break, or something more substantial, CoD remains a silly, slick and intuitive shooter that sucks you in and keeps you there. The ready-built combat rigs cater to different play styles so you can instantly pick the right loadout, whether you like to snipe or stab.</p> <p>For the first time there\u2019s weapon crafting, too, and a conscious effort to reward players for attempting different match-types, not to mention a neat 1980s theme park reboot of zombie survival. Prototype weapons are the strongest in the game \u2013 graded common to epic \u2013 and you obtain them by earning salvage as you play or completing challenges with one of four mission teams. The holy grail is a gun that provides a nuclear blast if you can string together 25 kills.</p> <p>Crucially, such objectives are optional and there\u2019s no chance of the camera being yanked-away as you complete them. Infinite Warfare improves online because the game doesn\u2019t dictate your experiences precisely as the developers intended. In many ways the campaign feels like a wrestling match between your game and theirs, perhaps a mirroring of their attempt to innovate within the constraints of the CoD franchise behemoth. But this doesn\u2019t excuse a forgettable plot or inferior fighting to its triple-A peers. Infinite Warfare could have been much more than a passable single-player movie attached to a super fast, super confident multiplayer infrastructure. As such, and with those moments of tantalising potential in mind, it feels like a wasted opportunity.</p> <p><strong>Activision; PC/PS4/Xbox One (version tested); \u00a350; Pegi rating: 18+</strong></p>",
  "<p>Many of us have been stuck in a Brexistential crisis since June. Uncertainty over if, whether and how <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/article-50\">article 50 will be triggered</a> only sharpens our distrust of political leaders, and ever more hyperbolic, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/nov/04/labour-condemns-newspaper-attacks-on-judges-after-brexit-ruling\">rabble-rousing headlines</a> appear now on a daily basis. We face another looming worry: the possibility of a Donald Trump victory in the US. Like Princess Diana\u2019s death or 9/11, these are world events that we struggle to compute. They are absolutely real yet seem strangely unreal.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/nov/07/what-happens-after-clinton-trump-win-election-progressive\">Whether Trump or Clinton wins the US election, what follows is up to us | Rebecca Solnit</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Both Brexit and the US election raise questions about borders and identity, which trigger primitive and personal anxieties about the breaching of the boundary between inside and outside, provoking associations with the body. For example, there\u2019s the idea that the national border, our collective \u201cskin\u201d, might collapse, and that we might face annihilation. Or that we have something so precious that others wish to take us over, to invade us and steal this. A leader who promises to protect the boundary of inside and outside can thus have a special allure, as history shows. Hence the appeal of a Trump, with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/nov/07/donald-trump-presidency-america-endure-latinos-experience\">his Mexico-US wall</a> and his evocation of the \u201cTrojan horse\u201d of immigration. These images might seem laughable to many, but they touch on people\u2019s basic anxieties about boundaries.</p> <p>The supreme certitude and confidence of such leaders gains a particular power when the world feels so tenuous, fragile and uncertain. Our changing relationship to expertise, evidence and traditional hierarchical structures leaves a dreadful vacuum. We haven\u2019t really established any new forms of political organisation in their place. This is partly because new forms of organisation are quickly ridiculed as we struggle between old and new. And partly because at some level we take for granted that things can\u2019t and won\u2019t change.</p> <p>Yet, ambivalent as we so often are, we also yearn for change. The presumption that we wish to maintain the status quo forecloses our perhaps more covert desire to shake things up, turn over the apple cart, to see what happens. When these sometimes destructive whims <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/24/meriden-brexit-leave-regret-doubts-linger-eu-referendum\">turn into a reality</a> it can be all the more unsettling, as seen in the numbers of Bregrexit voters who didn\u2019t think their vote would really count, or people who secretly want a Trump victory to see what happens. Even the philosopher Slavoj Zi\u017eek says <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Channel4News/status/794232437337247744\">he would vote for Trump</a> for precisely this reason.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/oct/31/donald-trump-hillary-clinton-650-million-people-week-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/5a5j5\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2858198\"            data-video-name=\"Trump: Clinton would let 650 million people into US in one week \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"Pool\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-58171544e4b08d944ba4c889\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/10/31/161031TrumpImmigrationClaim2_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/10/31/161031TrumpImmigrationClaim2.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/10/31/161031TrumpImmigrationClaim2_WebM.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/oct/31/donald-trump-hillary-clinton-650-million-people-week-video\">Trump: Clinton would let 650 million people into US in one week</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>We like to ridicule such voters to assure ourselves that we act rationally, that we want the sensible, fair solution. But of course we all vote from a transitional space between reality and fantasy, influenced by pulls and pushes based on our background, and the histories of generations before us that have been transmitted to us both consciously and unconsciously.</p> <p>The reaction to this year\u2019s votes show a fundamental lack of curiosity, an increasing intolerance for other people\u2019s attitudes and ideals. People who vote for Clinton, Trump, leave, remain all believe in their position, and most will have constructed an internal logic to justify it. We must make the effort here to humanise the other by trying to find out, gently, about this logic, or we become ourselves the creators of Trump\u2019s dividing wall.</p> <p>In the face of such uncertainty, it is perhaps no surprise that experts are brought in to instruct us on how to cope. The advice tends to be quite simple. Limit your social media. Meditate. Connect with friends. Go out into nature. And, as the American Psychological Association (APA) recommends, \u201c<a href=\"http://www.apa.org/news/press/releases/2016/10/presidential-election-stress.aspx\">avoid catastrophising, and maintain a balanced perspective</a>\u201d. These suggestions are both vaguely useful and patently ridiculous, and they serve to depoliticise our situation. In their own way, they reinforce a split between inside and outside, as if it were sane to focus on inner peace when Rome is burning.</p> <p>We need instead to remember the transformative potential of emotion. Uncertainty and fear can be a means to recognise the intimate, mutual relationship between our inner lives and outer political realities. Rather than aiming to stay calm, is it not time to remember that emotion has always been the fuel for collective action, social justice movements and political change? Advice on how to cope through techniques of self-management, here, can interfere dangerously with what our bodies are cueing us to do.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Perhaps we can find inspiration instead in those who suffered trauma and tried to do something with it</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Perhaps we can find inspiration instead in those who suffered trauma and tried to do something with it.

If Clinton wins, if things seem to be stabilising, we risk becoming complacent again, and losing the transformative potential of the emotions we now feel. We must resist this false calm, for it would reduce us to being subject once more to the forces that have created the current crises. Rather, we must surely use our feelings to charge us to create forms of organisation and resistance that, like Zolobajluk\u2019s banner, bear crucial messages. A breakdown, after all, always carries within it the seeds of a breakthrough if we take it seriously, and act accordingly.</p>",

The bill proposes to dismantle the statutory local safeguarding children boards (LSCBs), which bring together all local agencies working with children and families. The boards would be replaced with a duty on three people \u2013 representing the police, local council and health authorities \u2013 to decide how to manage these relationships.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/social-care-network/2016/oct/25/its-time-to-pause-the-misbegotten-children-and-social-work-bill\">It's time to pause the misbegotten children and social work bill</a> </p> </aside>  <p>These changes provide the backdrop for the annual conference of the <a href=\"http://www.lscbchairs.org.uk/\">Association of Independent LSCB Chairs</a> (AILC).

A new survey of LSCB members found that 95% want the current structure of local partnerships to continue, and that having an independent chair is crucial to their effectiveness. It is difficult to imagine how local agencies can give families a coherent and meaningful service if they do not plan and monitor it together. <br></p> <p>More than 40 years of experience shows that it is essential to manage partnerships, as the need for joint working is frequently in tension with other organisational and policy objectives. Agencies that work with families and children have different priorities and lines of accountability and authorisation, but they must share a common purpose for their joint safeguarding work. </p> <p>Safe and positive environments for children and young people can only be ensured through agencies working together and safeguarding arrangements have to be built, sustained, tested and continuously improved. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/social-care-network/2016/oct/07/outsourcing-childrens-services-sandwell-council\">Outsourcing  children's services is not a quick fix</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Above all, these arrangements must champion the interests and rights of children and young people above agency interests. They need to provide the strategic leadership that is essential to ensure the best outcomes for children, involving all partners \u2013 not only the police, health and local authorities \u2013 with a duty to cooperate and sanctions for non-cooperation. </p> <p>There is value in jointly scrutinising and improving practice, and drawing on comments from children, families and practitioners to provide accountable oversight and feedback on performance and outcomes. Effective partnerships learn from experience and evidence of what works well, creating arrangements that are proportionate, efficient and adequately resourced.

For Ningsih\u2019s family, in Cilacap, Central Java, having a daughter working in a far-off city never to return was all too familiar. In 2008, her older sister went to work as a domestic helper in Indonesia\u2019s capital Jakarta. Shortly after she arrived, she disappeared and has never been seen since.</p> <p>That was the same year Ningsih married at 17. Her son was born less than a year later after her husband left just before the baby\u2019s birth. She would be dead at 23.</p> <p>For her family at home, supporting six people on just $70 (\u00a356) a month from rice farming became increasingly difficult, and by the time Ningsih was murdered she was sending her family nearly four times that amount.</p> <p>Although she called her family every day, her son was too young to sit for long conversations and barely knew the woman on the other end of the phone. He was only five years old when she was killed.</p> <p>\u201cHer son never really knew what it meant to have a mother,\u201d Suyitno, Ningsih\u2019s older brother, tells the Guardian. \u201cHe knows this woman is dead, that she was murdered, but doesn\u2019t fully understand who she is in relation to him.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.censtatd.gov.hk/hkstat/sub/gender/labour_force/\">Roughly half</a> of Hong Kong\u2019s 340,000 live-in maids are from Indonesia, surviving on just HK$4,000 (\u00a3415) a month.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6f4592aff26c5144c0d0bab99206b36f10d810de\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6f4592aff26c5144c0d0bab99206b36f10d810de/0_0_4256_2840/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Indonesian migrant workers pray during a vigil in Hong Kong in 2014 for the two murder victims.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Indonesian migrant workers pray during a vigil in Hong Kong in 2014 for the two murder victims.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Philippe Lopez/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Desperate situations are common among <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2016/mar/14/forced-labour-common-among-hong-kongs-domestic-helpers-study-finds\">migrants in the city</a>.

  "<p>Graham Brady\u2019s time has come. For most of his life, the Tory MP for Altrincham and Sale West has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2014/dec/09/death-grammar-schools-tory-selection\" title=\"\">campaigned for grammar schools</a>. Though he is also supports leaving the EU, it was the issue of educational selection that propelled him into politics and defines him politically. As a teenager from a non-political family, he delivered leaflets during Trafford local elections in defence of Altrincham grammar school for boys, where he was deputy head boy.</p> <p>In his maiden Commons speech in 1997, Brady said: \u201cI believe passionately in the role of grammar schools as the greatest of social levellers.\u201d In 2000, William Hague, then party leader, made him \u201cgrammar schools spokesman\u201d in the opposition\u2019s education and employment team.</p> <p>By 2007, he was shadow minister for Europe. But a <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1551714/David-Willetts-speech-on-grammar-schools.html\" title=\"\">speech</a> by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2007/jun/26/education.grammarschools\" title=\"\">David Willetts</a>, then shadow education secretary, arguing that grammars were no longer key to social mobility, prompted Brady to speak out again. He was concerned the party might abandon its commitment to protect the 164 surviving grammars, having already, under David Cameron, apparently ditched ambitions to revive selection across the country. Brady resigned, halting a promising frontbench career. A little later, he formed a campaigning group, <a href=\"http://www.friendsofgrammarschools.org/\" title=\"\">Friends of Grammar Schools</a>, with 60 MPs attending the launch.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/video/2016/sep/14/why-does-theresa-may-want-to-bring-back-grammar-schools-video-explainer\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/53xqx\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2717686\"            data-video-name=\"Why does Theresa May want to bring back grammar schools? \u2013 video explainer\"            data-video-provider=\"guardian.co.uk\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-57d93571e4b05caf65ecd196\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/09/14/160914grammarsfinal_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/09/14/160914grammarsfinal_V4.webm\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/09/14/160914grammarsfinal.m3u8\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/video/2016/sep/14/why-does-theresa-may-want-to-bring-back-grammar-schools-video-explainer\">Why does Theresa May want to bring back grammar schools?</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>Now Theresa May, to everyone\u2019s surprise, has put <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/sep/09/theresa-may-to-end-ban-on-new-grammar-schools\" title=\"\">grammar schools</a> back on the agenda. Is she serious? Isn\u2019t she just trying to placate rightwing backbenchers who want her to go further and faster on Brexit?</p> <p>\u201cYou have to look at her history,\u201d Brady says. \u201cShe made her maiden speech in the same debate as me, speaking in defence of the assisted places scheme [under which the government paid for bright children to attend fee-charging schools], which Labour abolished. Besides, you shouldn\u2019t assume grammar schools only appeal to the right wing. There\u2019s enormous support across the party. If there were a vote, perhaps a couple of people would abstain, no more.\u201d</p> <p>I point out that recent comments from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/03/nicky-morgan-grammar-schools-plan-could-undermine-progress\" title=\"\">Nicky Morgan</a>, whom May sacked as education secretary, suggest there will be at least one outright opponent. \u201cShe was in office with a previous policy,\u201d Brady replies. \u201cI suppose she feels she ought to defend it.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/jul/18/justine-greening-grammar-schools-selection\">Justine Greening doesn\u2019t need grammar schools to bring back selection</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Brady states categorically that grammar schools should not be imposed but should open only where there is local demand. He is less clear about how that will be measured. The present position, he says, is absurd: we have specialist schools of all sorts and a new category of university technical colleges for pupils of 14 and up, yet new academically selective schools are automatically ruled out.</p> <p>\u201cIf the legislation were permissive rather than prescriptive, I cannot think of any plausible reason why a Conservative should object.\u201d He adds, perhaps betraying less confidence about Tory loyalty than he professes: \u201cDon\u2019t forget we\u2019ll have the support of the Northern Ireland Unionists and I\u2019d hope for some support from the Labour benches, where quite a few might abstain.\u201d</p> <p>Brady\u2019s views matter because he chairs the powerful Tory backbench 1922 Committee. When there\u2019s a leadership election, the 1922 chairman (there\u2019s never been a woman in its 93-year history) reads out the results; he regularly conveys the views of backbenchers to the party leader; and he\u2019s often the first person invited to Downing Street when a new Tory PM returns from kissing hands at Buckingham Palace.</p> <p>Brady was elected chair of the committee a few weeks after the May 2010 general election. When Cameron heard Brady intended to stand against the leadership\u2019s favoured candidate, he was offered a relatively junior ministerial role. Brady wasn\u2019t \u201csufficiently attracted\u201d by the job. \u201cI would be giving up a position that had quite a significant degree of access and the potential to influence the government\u2019s direction.\u201d</p> <p>He has never regretted resigning, he says. \u201cIt was at least six months before I could step out of my front door without strangers congratulating me. People would cross the road to shake my hand. Yes, 80% of them were pleased I stood up for our local grammar schools. But 20% said: \u2018I don\u2019t agree with you at all about selective education but thank God one of you MPs believes in something\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>Brady, well over 6ft tall and apt to laugh loudly when asked difficult questions, describes himself as a \u201cconstitutionally awkward northerner\u201d. He was born in Salford and the family \u2013 his father was an accountant, his mother a medical secretary \u2013 soon moved nearby to leafier Trafford. After state primary and grammar school, he studied law at Durham University, but decided he didn\u2019t want to be a lawyer.</p> <p>Chairing the university Conservative association, he found himself \u201ccampaigning for lots of candidates and thought, as one does: \u2018I can do better than that.\u2019\u201d He worked in public relations and briefly for the Centre for Policy Studies, the Thatcherite thinktank. At 29, he landed the candidacy for his home constituency, which has been safely Tory since the second world war.</p> <p>Since Brady and his wife of 24 years, who works part-time as his parliamentary assistant, have their main home in London, their two children went (as Cameron\u2019s children and those of the former education secretary Michael Gove now do) to Grey Coat Hospital, a posh Church of England comprehensive in Westminster. \u201cIt\u2019s a matter of what\u2019s available,\u201d he says.</p> <p>Several times, Brady quotes figures for Trafford, claiming that, even if its grammar schools are taken out of the equation, the results of its high schools (as its secondary moderns are now called) would put it above the local authority average. \u201cAn idea took hold in the 1960s that it was impossible to have a selective system while doing the best for the whole spectrum of ability. History has proved otherwise. Trafford, instead of getting rid of the parts of the system that worked, improved the parts that didn\u2019t. Now we have outstanding high schools, which some parents choose rather than the grammars and many of their pupils go to university.\u201d</p> <p>The comparison between Trafford and other authorities, I protest, is misleading because it is a solidly middle-class area. \u201cNo, it\u2019s hugely diverse. Some parts of the borough are barely a mile from the centre of Manchester.\u201d</p> <p>I suggest we look beyond Manchester. Most of the countries that do best in international comparisons of educational achievement \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/sep/20/grammar-schools-play-europe-top-education-system-finland-daycare\" title=\"\">Finland</a>, for example \u2013 have fully comprehensive systems. \u201cI am happy for the Finns to run the school system they do. Different models work better in different places.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/aug/23/argument-for-grammar-schools-selective-education-theresa-may\">Got a good argument for\u00a0the return of grammar schools?

Parents who can\u2019t pay fees should have the same choices in the state sector. If we allowed new grammars, some independent schools could become free state-supported academies, while retaining their current admissions arrangements.\u201d</p> <p>He argues that, in grammar schools\u2019 heyday, the state system was becoming so good that many independent schools were \u201cclose to packing up\u201d. When I point out that, in the same period, children from working-class homes had only a one in seven chance of being selected (one in three for middle-class children) for grammar school and even less if their fathers were in unskilled jobs, he merely barks that \u201cthey\u2019d have zero chance now\u201d.</p> <p>It seems an odd time to talk of bringing back grammar schools since London has recently shown that, even in big cities, comprehensives can achieve good results for children of all abilities. Whatever polls say, hundreds of thousands of parents will surely resist their return because they would cause disruption and damage successful schools. But Brady persisted with his campaign even when it was deeply unfashionable and there is a kind of nobility in that.</p>",

An isotope of iron, Fe<sup>60</sup>, was measured at a particular depth in the ocean\u2019s crust. The position in the crust sets the date, and the presence of the isotope betrays the supernova.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Sphalerons are very exotic, but they are a prediction of the Standard Model of particle physics</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The word \u201cisotope\u201d comes from the Greek, \u201ciso\u201d meaning the same, and \u201ctopos\u201d meaning place, because different isotopes of the same element occupy the same place in the periodic table. Atomic nuclei contain protons, with positive charge, and neutrons, which are neutral. Isotopes of an element differ from each other only by the number of neutrons. This has no effect on the chemical properties of the element, because it is the number of protons that determines the number electrons that must bind to it in a neutral atom, and the electrons in turn determine the chemistry. Hence the same slot in the periodic table.</p> <p>The mass will be different though, and this can, with care, be measured. Also, since the neutrons are important in holding the nucleus together, many isotopes are unstable, and decay to lighter elements over times ranging from fractions of a second, to millions of years.</p> <p>Iron has 26 protons, and the most stable, and therefore most common, isotopes of iron have between 28 and 32 neutrons. The \u201c60\u201d in Fe<sup>60 </sup>is there because it has 34 neutrons, making the total of neutrons plus protons equal to sixty \u2013 the atomic mass. </p> <p>If you have a sample of Fe<sup>60</sup>, after 2.6 million years, half of it will have decayed. Since the Earth is about 4.5 billion years old, any Fe<sup>60 </sup>it might have started with has long gone, and the abundances measured in a specific layer of the ocean crust can only have come from outer space. And they match the predictions Ellis and others made for delivery from a nearby (by astronomical standards) supernova, one which would have been easily visible, and perhaps as bright as the moon.</p> <p>By particle physics standards, twenty years (1996 to 2016) between a prediction and a measurement isn\u2019t too bad. The Higgs boson took nearly 50 years, but the impact on physics of that discovery is still being felt. The meeting in Abingdon was full of examples of this impact, and one of them highlights another connection between things we can hold in our hands and potentially mind-blowing physics, over timescales much longer than 50 years, or even the millions of years since the supernova.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/life-and-physics/2016/sep/18/could-the-higgs-boson-have-been-discovered-by-accident\">Could the Higgs boson have been discovered by accident?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>This connection involves weird objects called sphalerons, and probably explains not just how the chemical elements got here, but how the particles they are made of \u2013 electrons, and the quarks inside the protons and neutrons \u2013 came to be.

But it goes something like this.</p> <p>Sphalerons are very exotic, but they are a prediction of the Standard Model of particle physics, not something beyond it. And now we know the Higgs exists, we know they should exist too\u00b9.</p> <p>To get an idea of what a sphaleron is, you have to think of the way we describe particles, using something called \u2018<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/life-and-physics/2011/oct/11/1\">perturbation theory</a>\u2019. Try this. Imagine the empty universe, with no energy, sitting at the bottom some of some valley, say on a skateboard park.</p> <p>Adding a bit of energy corresponds to allowing skateboarders to zip up and down the sides. If the energy is small, they will roll back down again, go up the other side, and oscillate like that. These oscillations correspond to particles in perturbation theory, rippling along through space-time in their merry quantum way.</p> <p>But if you add a lot of energy, the skateboarder can zip over the wall of the valley, into the next door valley on the park. That\u2019s a sphaleron, sort of.</p> <p>They would have been around in the early universe, because the energy density was very high then. And they seem to have played a crucial role, as follows: There are various things which don\u2019t change in perturbation theory, things that are conserved. One thing, in our skateboard universe, is the average position of the boarders. They spend as much time on one side of the valley as they do on the other side; the average is the bottom of the valley. </p> <p>But if a boarder sphalerons his or her way over the wall into the next valley, their average position has moved \u2013 to the centre of the next valley. The conservation law has been violated. Sphalerons in the early universe violate conservation laws too, and one that they violate is the number of particles\u00b2. They can add more quarks and leptons to the universe. This is an essential part of how the stuff we are made of got here at all.</p> <p>So not only are many of the heavier atomic nuclei around us made in supernovae, the electrons orbiting them are the result of sphalerons.</p> <p>I\u2019m aware that \u201cthink of the universe as a skateboard park\u201d is a a bit Douglas Adams, but it\u2019s the best I can do. And in difficult times, this kind of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/life-and-physics/2016/jan/23/neutrinos-antimatter-and-science-as-a-holistic-detective-agency\">interconnectedness</a> can be strangely comforting.</p> <p><em>\u00b9We even know the energy at which they should exist \u2013 about 10 TeV. This is higher than we can observe in LHC collisions, because even though these go up to 13 TeV, the energy is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/life-and-physics/2015/feb/21/what-goes-on-inside-a-proton\">shared between many quarks and gluons</a>, and so is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/life-and-physics/2012/feb/18/1\">not all available</a> for making new objects, but it is not ridiculously high.</em></p> <p><em>\u00b2 Strictly, the baryon number plus the lepton number number.</em></p> <p><em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/jonmbutterworth\">Jon Butterworth</a>\u2019s book </em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/may/02/smashing-physics-jon-butterworth-review-cern-higgs-boson-particle\"><em>Smashing Physics</em></a><em> </em><em>is available as \u201cMost Wanted Particle</em>\u201d<em> in Canada &amp; the US.</em></p>",

Now the government has had to change a lot of its policies...You are saying that even if the government changes everything it does, we have to be static and not respond at all to the changing circumstances brought by a promised break in government. If the government put up its policies that it was said before the election, maybe I could see some of what you\u2019re saying then.</p> </blockquote> <p>Shorten was also asked about the cost of potentially dropping the proposed backpackers tax from 32.5% (not yet implemented) to the existing bill of 19% to Labor\u2019s proposal of 10.5%.

Xenophon says he has told the government the NXT bloc will look at the <strong>forever ban proposal</strong> but this is a \u201cconscience issue\u201d for his parliamentarians. By this he means the <strong>NXT bloc may split on this issue</strong>. In any case, they are not yet set in stone about which way to go. Xenophon is sounding relaxed about his people voting in different ways on this proposal.</p> <p>In terms of Labor\u2019s decision this morning to reject the proposal, here\u2019s a <strong>couple of quick analytical thoughts</strong>.</p> <p>It\u2019s been obvious for a little while that the government\u2019s drive-by attacks on Labor on the boats don\u2019t resonate politically quite as much as they used to. It could be because the boats have stopped, voters are no longer so fixated on unauthorised arrivals making their way south.</p> <p>This trajectory did happen during the Howard years, voters were fixated on the problem (aided by a government telling them constantly it was a problem), but once the \u201cproblem\u201d was \u201cfixed\u201d, it was actually an electoral plus for <strong>Kevin Rudd </strong>in 2007, when he went to the election promising to wind back the punitive \u201cPacific solution\u201d.<br></p> <p>So perhaps it\u2019s just a case of the politics being moderately less toxic. Labor is certainly less worried than it used to be about standing up to the government on border protection, and the new shadow immigration spokesman, <strong>Shayne Neumann</strong>, has set quite a different tone in the portfolio to his predecessor, <strong>Richard Marles</strong>.</p> <p>But I also think there was <strong>no way on God\u2019s earth that the left faction would have supported this latest policy foray by the government</strong>. I suspect Shorten, the leadership group, and the shadow cabinet knew that. It would have been fraught if Shorten had insisted on exercising a bit of \u201cme too-ism\u201d on the government\u2019s proposal. Hence today\u2019s result. Labor says nope, nope, nope.<br></p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-11-08T01:14:13.282Z\">at 1.14am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-58212292e4b029b92ca46740\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-11-08T00:56:56.014Z\">12.56am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>On the backpacker tax, <strong>Bill Shorten</strong> wants us to wait for <strong>Chris Bowen</strong>, the shadow treasurer, who has a press conference coming up shortly.

We\u2019ve long argued for this.</strong>\u201d</p> <p>On the parliamentary inquiry that now seems to be looming after months of agitation by government conservatives, Triggs said she was \u201copen to seeing what the inquiry might suggest \u2014 whether the language could be clarified and in our view strengthened that enables us to support the multicultural society that we are\u201d.</p> <p>Asked specifically about replacing offend and insult with the word vilify, Triggs said: \u201cI would see that as a strengthening, it could be a very useful thing to do.\u201d</p> <p>With the government running a procession of attacks both on her conduct as president of the commission, and the commission\u2019s oversight of discrimination cases, Triggs also hit back at the criticisms.</p> <p>She told the ABC the prime minister\u2019s commentary after the federal circuit court\u2019s dismissal last week of a racial discrimination complaint made against three Queensland University of Technology students was \u201cwrong\u201d.</p> <p>Turnbull in an interview on Monday said the judge in the case had made negative reflections on the commission in the case, and he urged the organisation to reflect on whether it was acting in a way that was undermining public support for its work.</p> <p>Triggs said the prime minister\u2019s comments were factually wrong.</p> <p>\u201cThe commission never prosecutes, never brings a case, never pursues any matter. Once we have declared that the parties cannot conciliate the matter we will terminate it and that was done about 15 or 16 months ago [for the QUT case].</p> <p>\u201cSo we had nothing whatever to do with the federal circuit court and indeed, contrary to the prime minister\u2019s statement, the federal district court said nothing whatever about the Human Rights Commission or its role.\u201d</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-11-08T01:20:39.171Z\">at 1.20am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-582110aee4b029b92ca46707\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-11-07T23:43:19.621Z\">11.43pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>It would appear there are duelling tweets between Coalition and Labor party rooms.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/JamesMcGrathLNP/status/795765199705808896\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">As nothing much is happening in Canberra atm, here is a photo of the carpet from the Coalition Party Room. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/auspol?src=hash\">#auspol</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/TV6VbUySUj\">pic.twitter.com/TV6VbUySUj</a></p>&mdash; James McGrath (@JamesMcGrathLNP) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JamesMcGrathLNP/status/795765199705808896\">November 7, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/MurrayWatt/status/795768636082241536\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Oh come on.

For much of the past 20 years Durand has done the job of educating them reasonably well, but its legacy is likely to be a case study in what can go wrong when schools are encouraged to operate, as they have been for two decades, in a market, with too much freedom and not enough oversight.</p> <p>Its ambitious leader, <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/06/03/sir-greg-martin-the-superhead-who-fell-from-grace-fights-back/\" title=\"\">Sir Greg Martin</a>, one of Michael Gove\u2019s much praised favourite heads, recognised early on the benefits of opting out of direct local authority oversight and becoming an autonomous state school.</p> <p>An early adopter of grant-maintained status, <a href=\"http://www.durandacademy.com/our-school/our-history/\" title=\"\">Durand</a> had become a foundation primary school under Labour and an all-through academy converter in 2010.

There are several possible reasons. Some headteachers have been allowed to accrue too much power. The obsession with the \u201cflagship\u201d school has been accompanied by the inexorable rise of the knighted, flamboyant, noisy and often overpaid \u201csuperhead\u201d, whose short-term successes and individual style often blind their paymasters to personal flaws.</p> <p>A recent study from the <a href=\"https://hbr.org/2016/10/the-one-type-of-leader-who-can-turn-around-a-failing-school\" title=\"\">Harvard Business Review</a> into school leadership suggested we are still attracting too many of the superhead types and not enough \u201carchitects\u201d, the low-profile, unshowy heads who concentrate on sustainable improvement and the boring business of getting the teaching right.</p> <p>The independent state school programme has also rested too heavily on the notion that freedom, entrepreneurial spirit, and untested gimmicky innovation \u2013 such as a half-baked \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2014/jun/17/boarding-academy-school-for-state-pupils\" title=\"\">Eton of the state sector</a>\u201d boarding school \u2013 would somehow automatically deliver high standards and probity.</p> <p>In his book <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/education-education-education.html\" title=\"\">Education, Education, Education</a>, Labour\u2019s academy architect Lord Adonis explains why he resisted calls to put a tougher legal framework around his favoured schools: \u201cIn my experience charisma, persuasion and money, not legislation and regulation, are the great drivers of reform\u201d, he said.</p> <p>Sadly that proved to be a fatal mistake. Politicians love the idea of dynamic unfettered edu-knights riding to the rescue of failing schools, but sponsors, academies and free schools have not provided a miracle cure and, while many leaders have strong moral values and don\u2019t abuse their position, Martin isn\u2019t the only <a href=\"https://www.tes.com/news/school-news/breaking-news/charting-downfall-famous-five-superheads\" title=\"\">celebrity head</a> to have fallen from grace.</p> <p>But the most obvious lesson from Durand is that healthy autonomy needs&#xa0;the counterweight of rigorous oversight. It is mind-boggling that Durand was allowed to get away with this for so long.</p> <p>Justine Greening may have made a sensible retreat when she quietly dumped the idea of academies for all two weeks ago. She and Theresa May, who seem more sober sensible types than their recent predecessors, may not be seduced by the cult of the superhead.</p> <p>But she still has the headache of trying to work out how to oversee the thousands of existing independent state schools. I suspect we may not have seen the last of Martin, who still appears as chair of the Durand governing body on the school\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.durandacademy.com/our-school/governing-body/\" title=\"\">website</a> and seems determined to fight to the end. Greening\u2019s challenge will be to ensure we don\u2019t see the likes of Durand again.</p>",
  "<p>It is common for employers keen to promote a modern workplace culture to offer some degree of flexible working. This could be for parents who leave the office early to make the school run, those faced with lengthy commutes, or employees who simply wish to stay home \u2013 accessing emails from the coffee table rather than their desks.</p> <p>The benefits are numerous. There is no morning commute, meaning diligent workers who choose not to spend extra time in bed can begin their working days earlier and finish later, and there are fewer office distractions.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--showcase\"> <blockquote> <p>Home workers said they felt isolated and unsupported</p> <footer> <cite></cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p><a href=\"https://hbr.org/2014/01/to-raise-productivity-let-more-employees-work-from-home\">Early studies</a> of the effectiveness of stay-at-home workers showed remote employees were more effective in their day-to-day roles than office-based staff. One reason was, quite simply, gratitude. Staff were so keen to prove the merit in home working that they consciously worked harder and longer, producing better results for their organisations.</p> <p>But what happens when gratitude runs out? Today, 4.2 million UK employees work from home, <a href=\"https://www.tuc.org.uk/workplace-issues/work-life-balance/four-million-people-are-now-homeworkers\">according to the Trades Union Congress</a>. Thanks to the promotion of a better work-life balance and increasingly connected technology it is no longer unreasonable for employees to ask for, or expect, a degree of flexibility.</p> <p>My research \u2013 <a href=\"http://etheses.lse.ac.uk/3349/\">a study of more than 500 staff and managers</a> on attitudes towards flexible working \u2013 attempted to discover whether these positive effects have waned.</p> <p>The results revealed that after a prolonged period of remote working, employees no longer viewed working from home as a privilege and therefore behaved no differently to office-based staff, producing similar results. In fact, some employees began to harbour ill-feeling towards their employers as they felt they were not supported enough.</p> <p>Working from home, although convenient, also brings added expense for employees. Greater use of lighting and heating pushes utility bills up \u2013 something office-based colleagues do not have to consider. Remote workers may also feel that home working brings significant savings for companies, which should be shared with them.</p> <p>Aside from additional financial support, remote workers craved professional support as well. Home workers had less communication with office staff, limited face-to-face interactions and, over time, found it harder to integrate with staff at the office. Reduced engagement, limited communication and a lack of opportunities for knowledge sharing stunted their professional progression.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/shortcuts/2013/feb/26/working-from-home-five-golden-rules\">Working from home: the five golden rules</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The isolation faded company loyalties to the point where remote workers were almost free agents \u2013 a worrying prospect for any employer looking to retain top staff. Not only was it difficult to convince remote workers to come into the office, but the breakdown of relationships often caused employers to resent their remote employees, feeling that they were taking liberties and were not dedicated enough to the organisation.</p> <p>Jeremy Tipper, director of consulting and innovation at Alexander Mann Solutions, has experienced this breakdown first-hand. \u201cEncouraging flexible working in a manner that best suits employees\u2019 lifestyles is the norm now for a vast number of businesses,\u201d he says. \u201cThe majority of the workforce now goes so far as to expect access to more flexible options. However, it can be detrimental to the business if an employer or even other members of staff fall into the trap of viewing those making this choice as second-rate employees.\u201d </p> <p>Many companies lack the organisational structure to manage remote workers effectively \u2013 here are three tips to help them:</p> <h2>Manage expectations</h2> <p>Implementing flexible working without actively managing the arrangement is a huge problem for many companies. Some remote workers operate without instruction, little communication and no training. Companies should set flexible working policies at the beginning of the employment contract and review practices regularly with employees to ensure mutual understanding and satisfaction, and to foster wider organisational support.</p> <h2>Communicate better<br></h2> <p>Many home workers may prefer to have less contact with colleagues, but this can be detrimental to team cohesion and affect both company compliance and productivity. A communications strategy should be employed from the outset and followed. Regular catch-up meetings, Skype and video conferencing can help bridge the gap between home and office, and keep remote staff integral to the team.</p> <h2>Offer support</h2> <p>Better support for flexi workers can prevent ill will. Buy-in from all sides is essential for this. Establishing opportunities for employees to give feedback on working practices and suggest areas for improvement can give workers a sense of control over their roles. Tipper adds: \u201cThese individuals are just as valuable and it\u2019s the responsibility of employers to ensure they feel like they are part of the business, even if they aren\u2019t physically in the office.\u201d</p> <p>As flexible working increases, it is vital for employers to be better equipped to manage remote staff. If companies expect home workers to be more productive, or if workers expect greater levels of flexibility or support without reciprocation, either party \u2013 or both \u2013 could be left disappointed.</p> <p><strong>Looking for a job?

The firm\u2019s contract <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2016/jul/25/deliveroo-workers-contracts-ban-access-to-employment-tribunals\">even tells those who sign up to make deliveries that they cannot test this status at the employment tribunal</a> \u2013 although lawyers have dismissed this as unenforceable.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/sep/12/what-its-like-working-for-deliveroo\">What's it like working for Deliveroo?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The request for collective bargaining, which will cover only those working in Camden, north London, is designed to force the company to acknowledge the riders as workers. Independent contractors are not able to request collective bargaining in this way. <br></p> <p>The letter, sent by the general secretary of the IWGB, Jason Moyer-Lee, and addressed to Deliveroo\u2019s founder and chief executive Will Shu, calls for the company to recognise drivers working in one of its central London delivery zones. The letter gives the company 10 days to respond, and says that if the request is refused or unanswered the union will go to the central arbitration committee. </p> <p>It adds: \u201cOf course, for the CAC to entertain our request they will need to decide that Deliveroo drivers are \u2018workers\u2019 and not the \u2018independent contractors\u2019 you have bogusly deemed them to be.\u201d</p> <p>The somewhat unconventional approach to having riders recognised as workers <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/oct/28/uber-uk-tribunal-self-employed-status\">follows a recent employment tribunal case which found that a group of drivers for car-hailing firm Uber should be classed as workers</a>. <br></p> <p>That case, which is now expected to go to appeal, put the spotlight on other firms with large self-employed workforces, and may lead to new claims being taken to the employment tribunal.</p> <p>Moyer-Lee said: \u201cThe importance of achieving a collective bargaining agreement for Deliveroo workers is not just the ability to negotiate pay and terms and conditions, but also to keep chipping away at this bogus narrative that gig economy workers are a bunch of independent entrepreneurs who are so lucky to benefit from the generous flexibility provided by the likes of Uber and Deliveroo.<br></p> <p>\u201cDeliveroo drivers work for Deliveroo and as such they should be entitled to paid holiday, minimum wage, trade union rights, and all the other rights associated with worker status.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/13/the-guardian-view-on-the-gig-economy-time-to-get-serious-about-casual-work\">The Guardian view on the gig economy: time to get serious about casual work | Editorial</a> </p> </aside>  <p>If the request does end up with the CAC one thing it will need to determine is whether there is sufficient support for the union amongst the workforce. At least 10% of the proposed bargaining unit will need to be union members, and a majority of the proposed group will need to be considered likely to favour recognition. </p> <p>If Deliveroo does agree to recognise the union it is likely to be the first collective bargaining agreement in the \u201cgig economy\u201d. Although recognition will only apply to riders in Camden, it could set a precedent for other people in insecure jobs. </p> <p>John Hendy, a barrister who has advised IWGB said the application for collective bargaining was \u201ca timely and vital step forward\u201d. He said: \u201cThose working in the gig economy will never see a significant improvement to their terms and conditions without being represented by a union in collective bargaining.\u201d</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/16/deliveroo-announces-it-will-not-force-new-contracts-on-workers\">request follows successful protests by drivers in London who objected to the trial of a new pay structure</a> which would have seen them moved from an hourly rate to a payment per delivery. The change affected several zones, including Camden, and some riders said it would mean their pay was cut. </p> <p>After several days of demonstrations and some drivers refusing to work, the company agreed that it would allow riders who did not want to to move to different zones during the 90-day trial.</p> <p>In a statement Deliveroo did not comment on the IWGB\u2019s request for recoginition. </p> <p>It said: \u201cAs Deliveroo continues to grow, we are committed to providing great opportunities for UK riders, with the flexible work riders value, and a payment model which is fair, rewarding and better matches riders\u2019 time with our customers\u2019 orders.<br></p> <p>\u201cWe have been in close and regular contact with our riders throughout the trial, and as you would expect we will be writing directly to our riders to inform them of the next steps as the trial comes to an end.

The government said <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/nov/03/brexit-ruling-will-not-derail-article-50-timetable-says-no-10\">its Brexit timetable would not be affected</a> and it still intends to begin divorce proceedings before the end of March. </p> <p>The decision was about how, not whether, Brexit would happen: while many suggested parliament could \u2013 and perhaps should \u2013 now try to push for a soft Brexit with enhanced single-market access, it is highly unlikely to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/nov/07/keir-starmer-labour-will-not-block-article-50-but-must-know-plan\">block Brexit altogether</a>.</p> <p>That did not stop a ferocious reaction to the decision in some quarters \u2013 despite sovereignty of the British parliament, and the right of British judges to rule on British matters, being what much of the leave campaign was about. Ukip\u2019s interim leader, Nigel Farage, said he feared the worst:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I worry that a betrayal may be near at hand \u2026 I now fear that every attempt will be made to block or delay the triggering of article 50.

Both she and May, on a plane to India for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/nov/06/india-warns-uk-immigration-policy-wreck-post-brexit-trade-deal\">difficult talks</a> on a potential new trade deal, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/nov/06/truss-and-may-forced-to-stand-up-for-article-50-judges-after-tabloid-abuse\">refused to criticise the newspapers\u2019 attacks</a>. May said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I believe in and value the independence of our judiciary. I also value the freedom of our press. These both underpin our democracy.</p> </blockquote> <p>Addressing parliament on Monday, the Brexit secretary, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/nov/07/david-davis-parliament-will-not-dictate-brexit-talks\">David Davis, said little we did not already know</a>. He repeated that one reason the government did not want parliament involved too much was so as not to reveal its hand, and accused MPs calling for parliamentary control of the process of wanting to derail Brexit:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>There\u2019s a balance between consulting parliament, and not undermining the government\u2019s negotiating position ... If parliament insists on setting out a detailed minimum negotiating position, that will quickly become the maximum possible offer from the negotiating partners ... In other words, the whole approach is designed to wreck the negotiation.</p> </blockquote> <p>It\u2019s still far too early to say what the decision will end up meaning for Brexit. Among the possibilities, the government could: a. win its appeal; b. fast-track a simple article 50 resolution through parliament; c. get bogged down in endless amendments; or d. decide to call a snap election (see below). </p> <p>Whichever way you cut it, though, it was a heavy blow for May, whose stock \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/aug/22/brexit-means-brexit-when-is-big-question\">Brexit means Brexit</a>\u201d and \u201cno running commentary\u201d bromides may now prove very difficult to maintain. </p> <h2>The view from Europe</h2> <p>While there was little official reaction from EU governments or the Brussels institutions, European capitals will certainly now worry that the Brexit process \u2013 which all would like to be over as quickly as possible, and certainly before the 2019 European elections \u2013 could get complicated. </p> <p>The Dutch finance minister, Jeroen Dijsselbloem, <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-11-03/brexit-court-ruling-will-lead-to-uncertainty-dijsselbloem-says\">explained to Bloomberg</a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I hope this doesn\u2019t cause even more vagueness and more of a delay, because that\u2019s bad for the UK as well as for the EU ... One of the biggest risks of this process is that it will lead to a very long period of uncertainty. </p> </blockquote> <p>Privately, several EU diplomats echoed the sentiment. One said the most important thing now was \u201cthat we keep on track with the timetable\u201d; another added, with admirable frankness: \u201cWe all know that involving parliaments in complicated, detailed, negotiations is not the smoothest way to go.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"af610755b7c165fe50b88620359743ef903bd76c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/af610755b7c165fe50b88620359743ef903bd76c/0_195_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jeroen Dijsselbloem in Brussels\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jeroen Dijsselbloem in Brussels on Monday.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Zuma Wire/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The European press was harsh. <a href=\"https://www.welt.de/debatte/kommentare/article159246795/Der-Triumph-ueber-die-eigenmaechtige-Exekutive.html\">Die Welt declared</a> the high court decision a \u201ctriumph over an unauthorised executive\u201d, saying the \u201cobstinacy with which parliamentarians will now seek clarity\u201d over the government\u2019s Brexit plans is \u201cexactly what the prime minister had hoped to avoid\u201d.</p> <p>Separately, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/nov/06/european-commission-examine-terms-uk-deal-nissan\">the commission said it would examine the secret deal Britain struck with Nissan</a> to make sure whatever induced the Japanese carmaker to stay in Britain and build its next two models in Sunderland did not infringe state aid laws.

She must face the likelihood that both the Commons and the Lords will focus on securing single market access in ways that could split the cabinet and provoke resignations. The courts have left May little alternative but to change course on the most important issue of her premiership.</p> </blockquote> <p>Polly Toynbee goes further, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/nov/03/brexit-parliament-article-50-mps\">calling for a full-scale parliamentary rebellion</a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>There are times when MPs need to rise above their party interests, their own interests and the views of their constituents. That may risk being voted out, but they may earn more respect by standing up for the national interest as best they can determine: that\u2019s what representative democracy is for. Brexit is the greatest threat to national wellbeing since the war, and this will test the mettle not just of individual MPs, but of the nature and purpose of a representative democratic system.</p> </blockquote> <p>In the Financial Times (paywall), <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/3a1bd2ae-9f7e-11e6-86d5-4e36b35c3550\">Tony Barber argues that Brexit raises the stakes for the rest of the EU</a>, which he describes \u2013 citing an University of Athens professor \u2013 as resembling \u201can unhappy marriage held together by fear of incalculable divorce costs\u201d:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>In March EU leaders will commemorate the 60th anniversary of the bloc\u2019s founding treaty of Rome.

They will affirm that the EU does not imprison or weaken nations but multiplies their strengths when they act together. Above all, they will pledge to save their marriage because they regard the alternative as unbearably worse.</p> </blockquote> <p>Back at the Guardian, Zoe Williams looks forward, saying that while she has \u201cso far found it extremely difficult to engage with what a post-Brexit Britain should look like\u201d, regretful remainers and sane leavers now need to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/nov/06/ignore-leavers-tantrums-build-brexit-britain-eu\">concentrate not on the Brexiter tantrums but on what needs to be achieved post-Brexit</a> \u2013 because no one is going to stop it:<br></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>No technicality will be found to stop Brexit, nobody will snap their fingers and wake us up. It\u2019s not enough to point to looming catastrophes and say what we don\u2019t want; it\u2019s not enough to concentrate on what we might lose. We need to consider what could be better, in a Brexited Britain. That is dauntingly open-ended until we establish whose and which interests we want to press. </p> </blockquote> <h2>Tweet of the week</h2> <p>Didn\u2019t fully understand that article 50 ruling?

  "<p>Ogoo Farm in Sierra Leone\u2019s Waterloo District is about to bring in its October rice crop. The farmer is optimistic that it will be a record yield. Increasing agricultural productivity is one of the 146 priority initiatives included in the country\u2019s economic recovery plan, also known as the president\u2019s recovery priorities. If all goes well, many farmers will double their production this year.</p> <p>The country spends more than $110m (\u00a389m) annually on importing rice. In 2014, this represented 4.8% of the country\u2019s imports, second to refined petroleum. While Sierra Leone is still a long way from being self-sufficient in its staple food, initiatives such as providing farmers with improved seed rice and fertiliser are part of an extensive plan to jump-start Sierra Leone\u2019s agricultural sector.</p> <p>When President Koroma launched this 24-month economic recovery plan to address the catastrophic effects of the Ebola epidemic and commodities price crash in Sierra Leone, he was unequivocal about its demands, stating that it would require \u201ca new way of working\u201d, collaboration, sacrifice and unity. </p> <p>Mindful of the lessons of the Ebola response, which reasserted the need for Sierra Leone\u2019s sovereignty in its own development, the country\u2019s economic recovery plan is led by Sierra Leoneans. Aligning their support behind it, donors have signalled their approval for the approach, and as the largest single donor, with \u00a3240m, the Department for International Development (DfID) has a substantial stake in its success.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2016/nov/03/afghanistans-corruption-epidemic-is-wasting-billions-in-aid\">Afghanistan's corruption epidemic is wasting billions in aid</a> </p> </aside>  <p>After a nine-month focus on health, education, income and private sector support, the scope widened to include increasing access to water and energy, and boosting public sector efficiency for the remaining 15 months.<br></p> <p>The breadth of the plan reflects the scale of need in Sierra Leone. The economy contracted by 22% in 2015. Electricity reaches less than 10% of the population and only about 5% have access to piped water. Maternal and child health, which had been slowly improving thanks to a free healthcare programme for mothers and children, deteriorated during and after the epidemic. With as many as 100 children in a classroom, educational standards are poor and more than 60%<strong> </strong>of the population <a href=\"https://www.statistics.sl/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/sierra_leone_labour_force_survey_report_2014.pdf\">is illiterate or semi-literate</a> [pdf].</p> <p>The early months of the programme were taken up with necessary background preparations, such as an intensive planning process, which created the framework to allow recovery activities in all the country\u2019s 149 chiefdoms to be tracked weekly. During this period, managing the nation\u2019s expectations of an immediate improvement in circumstances was a challenge. Introducing community engagement officers to all 14 districts to keep dialogue going and exchange information has helped, and as visible signs of improvement begin to emerge, public confidence in the process is growing. <br> A school construction programme is under way to reduce class sizes by delivering 225 new classrooms across the country. It feeds into a bigger impetus to improve educational outcomes, as does a national school feeding programme, which will give the 1.2 million children in government and government-assisted schools a cooked meal two days a week.  A significant contributor to the severity of the Ebola outbreak was the chronic shortage of water, sanitation and hygiene facilities in schools, clinics and communities more generally. The 19 boreholes that have been sunk in Kambia, Sierra Leone\u2019s northernmost province, are the first of 125 that will provide safe water to communities with urgent needs. <br></p> <p>These are part of a wider scheme to supply water to 700,000 people in the provinces and 600,000 in the capital, Freetown, which started with a nationwide water-point mapping survey to identify what is available and where. The recovery plan has expanded to accommodate a dry season scheme for providing water in Freetown.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2016/oct/20/botwana-droughts-dont-spell-disaster-el-nino-countries-take-note\">Droughts don\u2019t have to spell disaster.

But what are we asking of the others who felt strongly about remaining within the EU? Are we reasonably expecting them, in their possibly deepening belief that Brexit will be calamitous \u2013 transforming perhaps a first-ranked nation into a second- or third-ranked one \u2013 to actively assist in that process?</p> <p>Who else would be expected to do that? Imagine an airline pilot instructed by unhappy passengers to crash the plane. Or a surgeon, convinced in a belief that an operation will kill the patient, being ordered to do it by family members. Which constructor would be&#xa0;told to erect a building they know will fall to earth? Which captain would be ordered to sea in a ship they feel sure&#xa0;will sink? It isn\u2019t elitist to acknowledge that \u2013 for all the populist disdain of experts \u2013 we still expect those we rely on to deploy good judgment on our behalf.</p> <p>This of course leads to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trustee_model_of_representation\" title=\"\">the question posed by Edmund Burke</a>: are MPs delegates, elected to gauge and reflect the popular view; or individuals selected for their intellect and good judgment? It\u2019s a bit of both, for we know that parliament does act as a check on populist impulses. Without it \u2013 if one believes years of opinion polling \u2013 <a href=\"https://yougov.co.uk/news/2014/08/13/capital-punishment-50-years-favoured/\" title=\"\">we would still be deploying the gallows</a>.</p> <p>I cannot see that, with the elements of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/22/project-fear-how-hope-got-sidelined-in-eu-vote\" title=\"\">Project Fear</a> still a long-term reality, and the chaos of the government\u2019s Brexit operation unfolding before our eyes, it would be unreasonable or undemocratic for MPs to say this path was a ruinous one and that they refused, as individuals, to lead us down it. If ever there were an issue to be debated as a matter of conscience, this is it. One cannot argue that the risks of Brexit are existential and then insist that normal rules apply.</p> <p>Of course a British people determined to invoke article 50 and achieve Brexit should be able to do so, and parliament as a body cannot ignore the electorate. But fearful MPs can and should use all means at their disposal to avert catastrophe, whether that entails diverting the nation away from the path of hard Brexit towards a softer alternative, or engendering a rethink of the whole thing.</p> <p>That would be undemocratic, the Brexiters will say. But I don\u2019t think it would. It is perfectly possible to accept the result of 23 June and at the same time use the democratic process to persuade the electorate that the decision it made was a mistake: to say that, while serious problems within the EU exist, this solution is the wrong one.</p> <p>Is it not through a perennially accepted process of reflection and revision that parliament can repeal bad legislation it has previously enacted; how, every so often, we replace one government \u2013 previously and democratically mandated by the people \u2013 with another of different outlook?</p> <p>Get over it, you lost, chant the Brexiters, but our democracy was never designed to be a sudden-death penalty shootout. Prior to 23 June, <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-36306681\" title=\"\">Ukip\u2019s Nigel Farage said a close vote would not settle the matter</a>. On Sunday he conceded that the result is not legally binding. He can hardly complain now if remainers refuse to sit on their hands.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/nov/06/ignore-leavers-tantrums-build-brexit-britain-eu\">Ignore the leavers\u2019 tantrums - it\u2019s time for us to build Brexit Britain | Zoe Williams</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Last week Stephen Phillips, Tory MP for the Lincolnshire Brexit stronghold of Sleaford and North Hykeham and a leaver himself, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/nov/04/stephen-phillips-resigns-over-undemocratic-brexit-process\" title=\"\">resigned his seat </a>over the government\u2019s attempt to keep parliament at arm\u2019s length over the nature of Brexit. He did not say that Brexit should not happen. He said the way Brexit was being pursued was \u2013 in his judgment \u2013 wrong and that he could not be part of it.</p> <p>What happened thereafter is instructive. \u201cWe look forward to campaigning to elect a new Conservative member of parliament,\u201d said <a href=\"http://lincolnshirereporter.co.uk/2016/11/shock-surprise-lincolnshire-resignation-sleaford-north-hykeham-mp-stephen-phillips/\" title=\"\">local party chairman George Clark</a>, to help Theresa May deliver on the \u201cexciting\u201d Brexit vision. So Phillips used his judgment, followed his conscience and helped in his own small way to shape this fundamental debate. His local party, meanwhile, exercised its right to pursue its own objectives. This may not on its own change the course of history, but at least in Sleaford and North Hykeham no one is now illogically conflicted.</p> <p>In time we may say of Phillips that nothing in his Westminster life became him like his leaving it, for he now sets an example to colleagues. If I were an MP convinced that Brexit as envisaged was a momentous error, grievous to to the nation, I would be telling my constituency this was my considered position and that I would be doing everything democratically possible to soften or halt it. This might, after discussion, prompt a rethink, or it might prompt the local party to seek a replacement, as will happen in Sleaford, and that would be its right. But if all MPs who see calamity coming followed their consciences, they would be making a contribution commensurate with the gravity of this moment.</p> <p>It would be a personal sacrifice for some, but it would also be a public service. A reminder that serving the public and ceding to its populists are often quite different things.</p> <p>\u2022 Comments will be turned on later this morning</p>",

These seven prodigal acres should be more democratically deployed, rather than becoming one more exclusive recreational zone in this neglected city.</p> <p>The zoo is controlled by the Brihanmumbai (Greater Mumbai) Municipal Corporation (BMC), which, despite a budget larger than some Indian states, has presided over the scandalous deterioration of what was, as recently as the 1980s, still <em>Urbs Primus in Indis</em> (\u201cIndia\u2019s primary city\u201d, as the plaque on the city\u2019s Gateway of India monument puts it). </p> <p>Rather than an African savannah, the BMC could put these useful millions towards fixing quotidian and long-term infrastructure problems.

  "<p>It\u2019s Monday morning and the start of a year 7 English class at Highbury Grove school, a large comprehensive in north London. The students have been played the soundtrack to a film and hands are creeping up as they are questioned about the role background music plays in setting the mood.</p> <p>Answers are tentative, but as the pace picks up, their vocabulary strengthens with discussion of \u201cforeshadowing\u201d and \u201ctransition\u201d and \u201cperspective\u201d. Encouraged by their young hipsterish teacher, Lewis Green, who tells them that \u201cjust because I challenge you it doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re wrong, it just means I want you to explain more\u201d, their answers become longer and more eloquent. By the end of the class, well over half the pupils have their hands up, bursting to speak.</p> <p>An ordinary, lively English lesson? Not quite. Hardly a word has been put to paper. The emphasis of this lesson, in a school in which 70% of students are in receipt of pupil premium, is on speaking skills. The approach is based on the work of consultant Martin Robinson, author of two <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/trivium-21c.html\">books</a> that attempt to bring classical principles to modern comprehensive education, surprise hits in recent years.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2013/aug/29/gcse-english-speaking-listening-drop\">GCSE English to drop speaking and listening components</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Robinson, who advises Highbury Grove, says: \u201cIt is important that young people develop educated opinions, that is, opinions that emerge after exploring and weighing up different sides of an argument.\u201d Robinson believes an educated 18-year-old \u201cshould be able to respond to gentle interrogation and not worry when they get to the point of not knowing, relish it even because they can explore and find out more\u201d.</p> <p>This week sees the launch of a campaign, the <a href=\"http://www.esu.org/stories/events/2016/the-oracy-network-launch\">Oracy Network</a>, to raise the profile of public speaking in the national curriculum, backed by the English Speaking Union (ESU) and involving, among others, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/may/10/headteacher-blair-peter-hyman-school\">Peter Hyman</a>, founder of School 21 in east London and an <a href=\"http://www.voice21.org/\">enthusiast for the cause</a>. Too many schools still don\u2019t seem to know about the benefits of encouraging pupils to be confident speakers, or haven\u2019t integrated oracy into other parts of the curriculum. A <a href=\"https://www.lkmco.org/oracy-state-speaking-schools/\">new study</a> published today by <a href=\"https://www.lkmco.org\">LKMCO</a> thinktank, reports that provision is patchy. \u201cFew schools evaluate the quality of pupils\u2019 verbal contributions in lessons, or communicate with parents about the quality of these contributions.\u201d</p> <p>The report says 57% of teachers say they have not received training in oracy in the past three years, and 53% would not know where to look for more information if they needed it.</p> <p>For Duncan Partridge, of the ESU, the government\u2019s much-criticised 2013 decision to remove speaking and listening assessments from GCSE English grades has proved both \u201ca threat and an opportunity\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s a threat because schools in the current climate don\u2019t tend to concentrate on what isn\u2019t being assessed. But it\u2019s an opportunity because students taking GCSE English will still get a separate speaking and listening certificate, which gives schools a chance to develop their oracy work.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6786b2d912bd4714b5f23267c2c227e47fc716f9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6786b2d912bd4714b5f23267c2c227e47fc716f9/0_157_4855_2914/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Boy in class with hand raised\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A year 7 English lesson at Highbury Grove school mainly involved discussion.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sarah Lee/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Nick Gibb may quibble \u2013 the schools minister was reported to have described attempts to develop classroom speaking as \u201c<a href=\"http://www.robinalexander.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Alexander-Neither-national-nor-a-curriculum-Forum.pdf\">encouraging idle chatter [pdf]</a>\u201d \u2013 but evidence of the link between oracy and higher attainment is firmly established. <a href=\"https://www.educ.cam.ac.uk/people/staff/mercer/\">Neil Mercer</a>, of Cambridge University, who has researched the subject, says: \u201cChildren who were taught the art of reasoned discussion significantly improved their scores in maths and science.

Commonsense rules for speaking are pinned up around the school, urging pupils to mind their slang and reject double negatives. A soapbox project runs through years 7 to 9 for which every student has to deliver a three-part persuasive speech to an audience that includes parents. \u201cOf last year\u2019s year 8, 192 out of 198 did their public piece and there were some fantastic contributions,\u201d says Sherrington. Sixth formers must give an oral presentation as part of their extended project qualification.</p> <p>Students reluctant to give a formal talk are encouraged to build up their arguments through one-to-one discussion \u201cdoing it again and again until it\u2019s better\u201d, says Fitch, who is also co-coach to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/aug/06/why-debating-still-matters\">England\u2019s winning World Schools Debating team,</a> sponsored by the ESU.</p> <p>But it\u2019s not only students who need encouragement says Sherrington: \u201cTeachers often think, they don\u2019t have time. There\u2019s so much content to get through. We tell them it\u2019s not an add-on, it\u2019s part of the pedagogy.\u201d</p> <p>Fitch adds: \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of learning where students don\u2019t actually have to verbalise concepts but it\u2019s useful.\u201d He describes teaching An Inspector Calls, when a student couldn\u2019t say the word \u201cvigorously\u201d. \u201cHe knew the word perfectly well, he just couldn\u2019t get it off the page.\u201d Fitch made him repeat it until he could.</p> <p>Sherrington has a similar story about a year 7 maths class where pupils were finding it hard to say \u201cdenominator\u201d. \u201cThey were using substitute, vague terms like the \u2018numbers at the bottom\u2019.\u201d He adds: \u201cEvery year group has its particular challenges. With some older pupils, it\u2019s not the speaking out that\u2019s the problem. They can be confident, cocky and loud, feel obliged to act up a bit. So I say to them: \u2018Your challenge, guys, is actually to play it straight.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>At Highbury Grove the experiment is in its early stages. But watching that year 7 group, hands stretched high by the end of the lesson, it\u2019s also not difficult to believe, as Fitch says, that \u201cstudents adapt quickly if they know speaking is something expected of them right from the start.\u201d</p>",

  "<p>For the past month, while the attention of the world has been fixed on every dramatic twist in the US presidential election, the renewal of armed conflict between India and Pakistan has barely touched the headlines. In the past few weeks, the two nuclear states have, between them, killed two dozen civilians and injured scores of others in exchanges of artillery fire across the disputed border \u2013 known as the \u201cline of control\u201d \u2013 that divides Kashmir into parts controlled by India and Pakistan.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/29/pakistani-soldiers-killed-surgical-strikes-kashmir-india\">latest flare-up</a> in the long-running war of attrition between the two countries comes on the heels of a bloody summer of protest and repression in Kashmir that has now been erased from memory by the banging of war drums in Delhi and Islamabad. Since July, when the killing of a young militant leader <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/11/kashmir-death-toll-23-protests-shooting-burhan-wani-independence-violence\">sparked a furious civilian uprising</a> across the Kashmir valley, the Indian state has responded with singular ruthlessness, killing more than 90 people. Most shocking of all has been the breaking up of demonstrations with \u201cnon-lethal\u201d pellet ammunition, which has blinded hundreds of Kashmiri civilians.</p> <p>In four months, 17,000 adults and children have been injured, nearly five thousand have been arrested, and an entire population spent the summer under the longest curfew in the history of curfews in Kashmir.</p> <p>All this has been quickly forgotten in the past two months. On 18 September, a small group of jihadi fighters, widely believed to have come from Pakistan, staged a commando raid on an Indian army camp near the northern Kashmir town of Uri, killing 19 Indian soldiers \u2013 the deadliest attack on Indian security forces in Kashmir in two decades. Indian politicians quickly blamed Pakistan, which the country\u2019s home minister described as a \u201cterrorist state\u201d, while Pakistani leaders made the implausible claim that India had staged the attack itself to distract from the protests in Kashmir.</p> <p>The Indian prime minister, Narendra Modi, who came into office promising to take a harder line with Pakistan, announced that \u201cthose behind this despicable attack will not go unpunished\u201d. At the end of September, India retaliated with what it called a \u201csurgical strike\u201d against alleged militant camps in Pakistan-controlled territory, which, according to an army statement, \u201ccaused significant damage to terrorists\u201d. Pakistan denied the attack ever took place \u2013 claiming that there had been nothing more than the usual exchange of fire across the border. Meanwhile, an ugly war of words continued to escalate in TV news studios, some of which were refurbished as pop-up war rooms.</p> <p>Since then, the relationship between the two countries, which is at the best of times characterised by varying degrees of hate \u2013 depending upon the political temperature in Kashmir \u2013 has soured to the point where both are now suddenly finding spies in each others\u2019 diplomatic missions. A tit-for-tat nearly every day, on TV, on social media, in ambassadorial corps \u2013 even in the realm of culture, where India has effectively banned Pakistani actors from working in Bollywood, and Pakistan has banned the screening of Indian films in cinemas. According to recent reports, civilians caught in the crossfire have been evacuated, hundreds of schools shut, and local residents pressed into service to ferry supplies to troops stationed high in the Himalayas<strong>.</strong> As always, the victims of the artillery duels have been the civilians living on either side of a border that did not exist until the middle of the 20th century.</p> <p>In the war of words that has followed the bloodshed in Uri, the brutal oppression of protest in Kashmir has been largely ignored. Indeed, the Indian state, aided by a near-militaristic TV news media, has used the Uri attack and its aftermath to cover up a surge of killings, maimings and blindings in one of the longest-running conflicts in the world. This is the story of the bloody summer that Kashmiris have endured \u2013 and of why they will not forget it.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>On 8 July, a militant rebel leader, Burhan Wani,<strong> </strong>was shot dead by Indian armed forces and police in a remote Kashmir village. The killing sparked a series of spontaneous <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/10/kashmir-death-toll-rises-as-protesters-defy-curfew\">demonstrations and protests</a>, which, in a matter of days, turned into a reinvigorated popular revolt against India\u2019s dominion over this disputed state.</p> <p>Wani\u2019s path to militancy began in another one of Kashmir\u2019s bloody summers \u2013 back in 2010, when Indian security forces killed 120 protesters. Wani, who was then 15 years old, is said to have joined a small group of homegrown militants after he and his brother were humiliated and abused by Indian soldiers. Over the next few years, he became Kashmir\u2019s most famous militant commander, and acquired something of a cult following among young Kashmiris, who saw him as a symbol of resistance against Indian occupation. Wani was a new breed of militant: unlike the first generation of Kashmir separatist fighters in the early 1990s, he did not cross over into Pakistan; he didn\u2019t use a nom de guerre, and he amassed a huge following on social media, where he issued brazen challenges to the Indian state. It was therefore no surprise that thousands attended Wani\u2019s funeral in his hometown of Tral \u2013 or that those who could not get there organised their own funeral services across the Kashmir valley.</p> <p>As Kashmiris took to the streets, police and paramilitaries were deployed in large numbers across the region. Thousands of young protesters charged at the armed forces with stones and slogans demanding freedom. Indian forces responded with lethal effect, firing bullets, CS gas, and metal pellets into the crowds. In less than four days, nearly 50 people were killed and thousands injured. More people took to the streets to protest against these killings, and the Indian forces and Kashmiri police killed and injured more of them. A cycle of protests connected to the funerals of those protesters were, in turn, fired upon, resulting in yet more killings and blindings. By the end of July, India was faced with a full-scale popular revolt in Kashmir.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"77f92c07beee9be688ba8e66092e7e795cfb8a59\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/77f92c07beee9be688ba8e66092e7e795cfb8a59/0_0_1536_2560/600.jpg\" alt=\"An Indian policeman aims a pellet gun towards Kashmiri protesters in Srinagar in July.\" width=\"600\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">An Indian policeman aims a pellet gun towards Kashmiri protesters in Srinagar in July.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Composite: Syed Shahriyar/Syed Shahriyar/NurPhoto via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The most recent figures put the number of dead at 94, including a young Kashmiri academic who was <a href=\"https://www.yahoo.com/news/soldiers-raid-village-indian-kashmir-one-dead-082540745.html\">battered to death</a> by Indian soldiers, and an <a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/protests-in-kashmir-valley-after-body-of-11-year-old-found-with-pellets-3036803/\">11-year-old boy</a>, whose body, riddled with hundreds of pellets, was found on the outskirts of Srinagar, the joint capital of Kashmir, in mid-September. Shockingly, more than 500 people, most of them young, were shot in the face with the pump-action \u201cpellet guns\u201d that the Indian forces routinely use to suppress protests. These weapons discharge hundreds of small metal pellets, or birdshot, capable of piercing the eye.</p> <p>As the uprising continued, the armed forces, by their own admission, fired nearly 4,000 cartridges at stone-throwing demonstrators, crowds protesting against police brutality, and even onlookers. This means that they sent, by one recent estimate, 1.3m metal balls hurtling towards public gatherings predominantly made up of young unarmed people.</p> <p>Children as young as four and five now have multiple pellets in their retinas, blinding them partially, or fully, for life. At the start of September, doctors at Kashmir\u2019s main hospital reported that on average, one person had their eyes ruptured by pellets every other hour since 9 July. \u201cIt means <a href=\"http://www.greaterkashmir.com/news/front-page/every-2nd-hour-lethal-pellets-rupture-an-eye-in-kashmir/227294.html\">12 eye surgeries per day</a>,\u201d one doctor told a local newspaper. \u201cIt is shocking.\u201d</p> <p>On 12 July, the fourth day of the protests, the state government, which is run by a controversial coalition between Modi\u2019s Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and a local ally, the People\u2019s Democratic Party (PDP), finally issued its first official statement on the use of the so-called \u201cnon-lethal\u201d pellet guns.<strong> </strong>A spokesperson for the government, representing the PDP, described its position to the media: \u201cWe disapprove of it \u2026 But we will have to persist with this necessary evil till we find a non-lethal alternative.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>There is no recorded instance of a modern democracy systematically and willfully shooting at people to blind them</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>At first, the statement appeared as a typical soundbite, the sort of thing that officials must compose and recite with studied ambiguity for the press \u2013 the \u201cgovernment version\u201d, as its known. But I was struck by its cavalier defence of state violence and brutalisation. It was obvious that this was not the spokesman\u2019s personal view; it was a clear articulation of the intent of the Indian state in Kashmir: <em>we have no choice but to shoot people in the eyes</em>.</p> <p>This was an unprecedented expression of state violence. There is no other recorded instance of a modern democracy systematically and wilfully shooting at people to blind them. At the end of August, according to data obtained by one of India\u2019s national newspapers, nearly 6,000 civilians had been injured<strong>, </strong>and at least 972 of them had suffered injuries to their eyes.</p> <p>According to official records at SMHS, the main hospital in Srinagar, 570 people sought treatment after their eyeballs were ruptured by metal pellets. Ophthalmologists at the hospital performed more surgeries in three days \u2013 from 10 to 12 July \u2013 than they had in the past three years. Many of the wounded were protesters, but not all. Not one of them deserved to be robbed of their sight.</p> <p>By 14 August, as India prepared to celebrate its Independence Day, Kashmir was under a near total blackout. I briefly lost touch with my parents, as the state cut off all telephones and the internet. I was reminded, once again, of the lines of the late Kashmiri-American poet Agha Shahid Ali, which still echo 20 years after he wrote them: \u201cThe city from where no news can come / is now so visible in its curfewed night / that the worst is precise.\u201d Just before the shutdown, I had talked to my youngest sister over WhatsApp \u2013 she was a little girl in the 90s, when Kashmir witnessed the first rebellion against Indian rule. \u201cI\u2019d never imagined my [three-year-old] child would see everything that I saw as a child,\u201d she told me.</p> <p>Rebellion against India\u2019s rule over Kashmir is neither new nor surprising \u2013 and the brutality of the state\u2019s response is equally familiar. In the 1990s, India came down hard on a widespread uprising in the Kashmir valley \u2013 killing, torturing, disappearing, and imprisoning thousands. Some estimates put the number of people killed since<strong> </strong>1989<strong> </strong>at 70,000. Some 8,000 non-combatants are thought to have been disappeared, and 6,000 are believed to have been buried in mass graves. Human rights reports have identified thousands of cases of torture, including shocking techniques such as \u201csimulated drowning, striping flesh with razor blades and piping petrol into anuses\u201d. According to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jul/09/mass-graves-of-kashmir\">a 2012 report in the Guardian</a>, government documents revealed that one group of security agents had \u201clopped off the limbs of suspects and fed prisoners with their own flesh\u201d.<strong> </strong></p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>In southern Kashmir, four girls, aged between 13 and 18, were shot in their faces as recently as last week</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Years later, very little has changed in the Indian state\u2019s response to the demand for self-determination from the people of Kashmir. In a matter of four to five weeks this summer, Indian troops, with a clear mandate to be unsparing, wounded over 10,000 people. One of the youngest \u2013 five-year old Zohra \u2013 was admitted to a hospital in Srinagar with <a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/kashmir-violence-what-are-pellet-guns-and-why-are-they-so-lethal-2913917/\">lacerations to her abdomen and legs</a>. Fourteen-year-old Insha was in the family kitchen when a <a href=\"http://thewire.in/51740/kashmir-young-paying-governments-lack-vision/\">swarm of pellets pierced her face</a>. She has lost vision in both eyes. In southern Kashmir, four girls, aged between 13 and 18, were shot in their faces last week. The prognosis for the youngest of these, <a href=\"http://www.catchnews.com/india-news/pellets-continue-to-blind-kashmiri-kids-but-it-has-stopped-making-news-1478345066.html\">13-year-old Ifra Jan</a>, \u201cis not good\u201d, a doctor said. It is doubtful that these little girls posed a threat to the military force \u2013 estimated at 700,000 soldiers and police \u2013 stationed in Kashmir.</p> <p>As the showers of metal pellets were unleashed upon protesters, bystanders and homebound schoolchildren, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/25/opinion/kashmir-and-the-inheritance-of-loss.html?_r=0\">hospitals in Kashmir</a> began to resemble scenes from the great wars of the 20th century. Rows of beds with blindfolded boys and girls on them, parents waiting anxiously, doctors and paramedics in attendance around the clock. On occasion, police and spies also infiltrated the wards to compile profiles of the injured, in order to place them under surveillance after their release. The wounded were brought in by the dozen, like birds in the hunting season.</p> <p>All of this was incomprehensible, even to longtime observers of violence in Kashmir. One of the largest military forces on the planet could not be waging a war against seeing.<strong> </strong>Perhaps a few aberrations, a crowd-control tactic gone woefully wrong \u2013 one hoped so, but the numbers kept piling up, eye after mutilated eye popping up on the screens of phones and computers, as journalists began to publish their reports.</p> <p>As none of the powerful men who run Kashmir from Delhi expressed qualms about the blinding of children, it became clear that in its hubris the Indian state had decided that snatching vision from a few hundred young people was a fair price to pay for keeping Kashmir in check. Perhaps itself blinded by a strain of arrogance peculiar to occupying powers, it continued to pummel a subject population into submission.</p> <h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> <p>The phrase Raqs-e-Bismil,<strong> </strong>used in mystic Persian poetry to denote the passion of the devoted, translates as the \u201cdance of the wounded\u201d. In the slaughterhouse of the Kashmir valley, even the grievously injured \u2013 with pellet-scarred eyes or broken limbs \u2013 have remained defiant. \u201cWe have even got some patients whose guts are perforated and they are asking when they can go back and join the protests,\u201d <a href=\"http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/2016/08/kashmir-story-defiance-grief-160821113602572.html\">one doctor reported</a>.</p> <p>Two-and-a-half decades of rebellion in Kashmir have hardened the indifference of India\u2019s political and intellectual classes to the human cost of the country\u2019s repressive tactics in the valley. Amid rising nationalist fervour, any sense of the basic rights of a suffering population has been eroded or vanished entirely. The hostility now appears to be total, unbridgeable, and for those on the receiving end, unbearable. Powerful TV studios urge the state to be more aggressively macho, while actively <a href=\"http://www.asianage.com/india/scribe-quits-tv-channel-over-bias-539\">suppressing or distorting news</a> from Kashmir. One prominent newspaper ran an online poll about the continued use of the pellets that had wounded and blinded so many Kashmiris \u2013 a clear majority voted in support. Eminent columnists speak calmly of the need for \u201charsh love\u201d toward civilian protesters to rationalise<strong> </strong>the state\u2019s ruthless response. And the Twitter account for a government initiative, Digital India, <a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/digital-india-twitter-handle-poem-to-kill-kashmiri-by-indian-army-deleted-shankar-pradad-3021298/\">posted a poem</a> calling for the army to murder Kashmiris until they surrender.</p> <p>As images from Kashmir began to circulate on the internet \u2013 despite frequent attempts to block communications, including at least one midnight raid on the offices of a local newspaper, and a blanket ban on one English daily, the Kashmir Reader \u2013 pictures of the wounded emerged by the dozen, many of them looking as though they had ruptured fruits where their eyes should have been. On the second day of the protests, more than 50 people were admitted to the main hospital in Srinagar. Medics and parents were desperate to save vision in at least one eye for those who had been shot, attempting to extract the jagged and irregular pellets. \u201cThis only happens in <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-india-36822567\">a war-like situation</a>,\u201d a surgeon sent from Delhi later said.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"9ab063d714870483d86b81e29ce26509b6334778\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9ab063d714870483d86b81e29ce26509b6334778/0_256_3900_2341/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A Kashmiri protester who was shot by Indian security forces in Srinagar, in July 2016.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A Kashmiri protester who was shot by Indian security forces in Srinagar, in July 2016.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tauseef Mustafa/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The protocol for the use of these crowd control weapons is to aim at the legs to disperse demonstrators. But it seems that the paramilitaries and the police have been deliberately firing into faces. Some may only have minor wounds, some will suffer limited loss of vision, some will lose one eye, some both, and some will be impaired for life, but the pitiless assault on protesting adolescents forces us to ask one question: is the Indian state happy to blind a generation?</p> <p>It is inconceivable that policy mandarins in Delhi or their advisers in Kashmir could be unaware of the destructive power of \u201cnon-lethal weapons\u201d. Earlier this year, the International Network of Civil Liberties Organisations and Physicians for Human Rights published a report titled \u201c<a href=\"http://www.iccl.ie/international-network-of-civil-liberties-organizations-launch-report-on-crowd-control-weapons.html\">Lethal in Disguise</a>\u201d. \u201cPellet rounds\u201d, it stated, \u201ccause an indiscriminate spray of ammunition that spreads widely and cannot be aimed ...\u201d They, therefore, \u201care not only likely to be lethal at close range, but are likely to be inaccurate and indiscriminate at longer ranges, even those recommended by manufacturers for safety\u201d.</p> <h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> <p>Many countries have banned police from using ammunition meant for hunting animals. The multidirectional spray of pellets was designed to catch prey in flight. But many countries have continued to use them as a means of force to control civilian demonstrators.</p> <p>In Israel, security forces often deploy lethal and \u201cnon-lethal\u201d ammunition against Palestinian protesters, and crowd-control weapons have blinded at least five young Palestinians in the last two years. The use of rubber bullets by police was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2014/apr/30/rubber-bullets-banned-catalonia-spain-video\">banned in the Spanish region of Catalonia</a> in 2014, after at least seven people were blinded by them on the streets of Barcelona.</p> <p>In 2011, months after the uprising in Tahrir Square that toppled an Egyptian dictator, a young police lieutenant, Mohamed el-Shenawy, became infamous for firing pellets into the eyes of protesters against Egypt\u2019s military government. His exemplary skill at blinding civilians earned him the nickname the \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/shortcuts/2013/mar/06/eye-sniper-tahrir-egypt-jailed\">Eye Sniper</a>\u201d, and his notoriety as a symbol of ongoing state brutality eventually led to a three-year jail sentence.</p> <p>Will India prosecute its own eye snipers? Or outlaw the use of these weapons?</p> <p>In the country\u2019s present hypernationalist mood, every kind of other is a suspicious figure, a ready-made scapegoat for any failure that befalls the politicians determined to make India great again: the secessionist Kashmiri, the impure Dalit, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/oct/03/inside-bishari-indian-village-where-mob-killed-man-for-eating-beef\">traitorous beef-eating Muslim</a>, the woman who speaks her mind, the anti-national journalist, the dissenting writer. Any voices who might call for a ban on these \u201cnon-lethal\u201d guns are certain to be ignored. To the contrary, ministers and police, and their demagogues and cheerleaders, have continued to advocate the use of both pellets and bullets against protesting crowds in Kashmir: unruly cattle must be reined in at any cost.</p> <p>Because Kashmiris have become accustomed to the violence inflicted on them \u2013 as they are to the indifference of the world \u2013 when pellets were first sprayed at protesters in the heated summer of 2010, most people processed this as nothing more than a new misfortune; just another element of the war in Kashmir. If one were to draw a diagram of the assaults inflicted on Kashmiri bodies over the decades, hardly a single part would remain unmarked: in the 1990s, when the violence was at its worst, the eyes were spared; now they seem to have become a favourite target.<strong> </strong>The victims of such tactics, consciously and not, cultivate reserves of tolerance for pain, but also a capacity to remember.</p> <p>I remember, too. I grew up amid the darkness of the late 80s and early 90s. I remember that most of us teenagers innately understood that being abused, slapped, or beaten with batons and rifle butts by an Indian trooper was a bit of a joke when compared to the horrors that others endured in the dungeons of Kashmir. (One of the most notorious torture centres, Papa II \u2013 a colonial-era building on the banks of Dal Lake in Srinagar \u2013 was refurbished and redecorated, and served as the stately residence of the late pro-India politician Mufti Mohammad Sayeed. His daughter, as the current chief minister, now presides over the brutalisation of another generation of Kashmiri youth.)</p> <p>I remember that the war in those years taught us to treat corpses and shrouds as reminders of passing time, which was measured for the young in massacres and assassinations. I recall, too, the tragic rupture in the Kashmiri body politic when an atmosphere of fear and loathing forced out the Kashmiri Pandits \u2013 a Hindu minority that had cohabited with Muslim Kashmiris for centuries \u2013 in an almost overnight exodus<strong>, </strong>many of them targeted and killed by separatist militants. Sanjay Tickoo, who runs an organisation for the welfare of Kashmiri Hindus, says: \u201cOver the past 20 years, we estimate that <a href=\"http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/spotlight/kashmirtheforgottenconflict/2011/07/201176134818984961.html\">650 Pandits were killed</a> in the valley.\u201d I don\u2019t know what happened to Sunil and Rajesh, my childhood mates from the primary school we all attended near an idyllic river bend in Verinag in south Kashmir.</p> <p>Growing up, I experienced a brutal, bleak time, as India\u2019s response to the uprising included the grotesque policy of \u201ccatch and kill\u201d, under which combatants and non-combatants alike were dispatched in summary executions or tortured to death. And yet, I don\u2019t remember such a vengeful assault on ordinary people as we are seeing now. Buoyed by a belligerent nationalist at the helm in Delhi, the security forces on the ground perhaps feel emboldened to unleash a more widespread cruelty.</p> <p>In 2013, an affecting <a href=\"http://india.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/11/25/casualties-of-kashmirs-unrest-live-in-the-dark/\">photo essay</a> by journalist Zahid Rafiq in the New York Times documented a few of the stories of those who had been blinded by pellets. It remains a grim testament to the darkness in Kashmir <strong>\u2013 </strong>even though the blindings at that time, amid hundreds dead, did not attract too much notice. At the time, hardly any Indian civil society group or human rights organisation thought fit to speak up about such a wicked crime. The wanton demonisation of the Kashmiri Muslim, a project that some media organisations in India take particular pleasure in, was perhaps fully realised even then. It certainly is now, when thousands<strong>, </strong>fed on a daily diet of nationalist fury, take to social media to celebrate the killing, maiming, and blinding of young Kashmiris.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>That the government in Kashmir<strong> </strong>\u2013 a collection of local elites comprising career politicians, technocrats, and chancers loyal to India \u2013 considers pellet guns a \u201cnecessary evil\u201d, might make us feel grateful. At least they acknowledge the \u201cevil\u201d part<strong> \u2013 </strong>perhaps to address their own guilty consciences.</p> <p>A few days into this summer\u2019s uprising<strong>,</strong> the Kashmir Observer, a local English-language daily, reported that the local government had deployed a fleet of brand new ambulances to securely <a href=\"https://kashmirobserver.net/2016/local-news/amid-bloodbath-streetsgovt-using-ambulances-ferry-vip-guests-picnicking-8686\">ferry visiting VIPs</a> to picnic spots in the valley. This was while protesters were being killed, maimed and blinded \u2013 and while the ambulances carrying them to hospitals were coming under fire from security forces.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"8b93e0246bc9206eeb55ba4c70583f22282ca528\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8b93e0246bc9206eeb55ba4c70583f22282ca528/0_97_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Victims of police shooting who have been blinded in one or both eyes in hospital in Srinagar.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Victims of police shooting who have been blinded in one or both eyes in hospital in Srinagar.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Yawar Nazir/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>An ophthalmologist at the main hospital in Kashmir told the Indian Express in July: \u201cFor the first time the <a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/kashmir-protests-non-lethal-weapon-pellets-causing-more-damage-to-eyes-doctors-2918249/\">foreign bodies are irregular edged</a>, which causes more damage once it strikes the eye.\u201d Irregular, sharp edges? I had assumed that the pellets fired at protesters \u2013 like rubber or plastic bullets, were round discoid things. It turns out that there exist different kinds of pellets, and in 2016, some Indian forces are using the jagged variety \u2013 which inflict greater damage to flesh and eyes alike, and which doctors say is far more difficult to remove.</p> <p>How did India get here? How is it all right for a constitutionally democratic and secular, modern nation to blind scores of civilians in a region it controls? Not an authoritarian state, not a crackpot dictatorship, not a rogue nation or warlord outside of legal and ethical commitments to international statutes, but a democratic country, a member of the comity of nations. How are India\u2019s leaders, thinkers and its thundering televised custodians of public and private morality, all untroubled by the sight of a child whose <a href=\"http://kashmirreader.com/2016/07/21/first-patient-to-have-pellets-in-heart-is-13-years-old/\">heart has been penetrated by metal pellets</a>? This is the kind of cruelty we expect from Assad\u2019s Syria, not the world\u2019s largest democracy.</p> <p>Historically, such an inhuman response to an uprising \u2013 to mass dissent \u2013 has been the province of empires and tyrants. A modern democratic nation rarely unleashes such violence, except upon victims whom it does not regard as its own people. It is quite clear that for India and its rulers, Kashmiris have been subjects and not citizens for as long as Kashmiris have refused Indian rule. You do not shower projectiles that target eyes and viscera on a people you consider your own. In snatching away the vision of Kashmiri children, the Indian state has decisively announced that it has only one message: <em>you must be servile and submissive, and if you refuse, we will unleash our fury</em><strong>.</strong></p> <p>With a hubris derived from its might and military dominion over Kashmir, the state convinces itself that it has the power to inflict blindness. In no time, then, it blinds itself too \u2013 to the <a href=\"http://www.hindustantimes.com/columns/unrest-in-kashmir-threat-to-the-idea-of-india/story-2uVkjCgSGdsXOEzKHVWIPK.html\">character of democracy</a> that is its central founding principle. The harsh repression of Kashmiri protests, the Nobel prize-winning Indian economist Amartya Sen declared in July, is \u201cthe <a href=\"http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/amartya-sen-kashmir-situation-democracy-raghuram-rajan/1/717959.html\">biggest blot on India\u2019s democracy</a>\u201d.</p> <p>It is hard not to see this mood of brutality connected, at the very least in its tenor, to the larger register of extreme violence, by both state and non-state actors, that has come to be normalised over the last couple of decades.</p> <p>There has been some dissent in India. Journalists, activists, even <a href=\"http://www.ndtv.com/opinion/over-40-days-curfew-in-kashmir-shows-how-wrong-we-have-got-it-1446756\">some politicians</a>, have written elegiac <a href=\"http://www.ndtv.com/opinion/what-burhan-wanis-death-exposes-for-kashmir-and-delhi-1430050\">columns and essays</a> on the savage response to the rebellion in Kashmir. They have implored their government to cease the brutality, to be kind, and to <a href=\"http://thewire.in/61373/framework-peace-kashmir/\">talk to Kashmiris</a>. But it appears that the Indian government, clouded by a newfound chauvinism and a hunger for votes, is in no mood to listen to the nation\u2019s voices of sanity. In August, only a few days after Indian forces in Srinagar murdered a <a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/kashmir-21-year-old-killed-by-pellets-case-registered-against-security-personnel-2951122/\">21-year-old cash-machine watchman</a> by firing 300 pellets into his body from close range, the Indian prime minister used a <a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/full-text-of-pm-narendra-modi-speech-pakistan-forgets-that-it-bombs-its-own-citizens/\">speech on Kashmir</a> to taunt Pakistan over its own atrocities against separatists in the province of Balochistan, where the Pakistani army has inflicted forced disappearances and summary executions on the Baloch people. \u201cPakistan forgets that it bombs its own citizens using fighter planes,\u201d he said. But Modi chose to forget that his own forces had, by then, killed scores of young Kashmiris.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>We need to interrogate the circumstances that have led to the deliberate blinding of hundreds of young people at the hands of armed forces in Kashmir, before this too is forgotten. As some of the wounded have begun to heal, some accounts have suggested that the damage may have been less severe than initially feared \u2013 that perhaps many of those who underwent eye surgery will regain \u201csome vision\u201d in at least one eye. This might make one feel better<strong> </strong>\u2013 relieved that its not worse \u2013 but there is something wrong with that kind of moral reckoning, akin to the Indian security officials who continue to maintain that pellet guns must be used because the alternative would be worse. One security official told an Indian news website that pellet guns had actually \u201c<a href=\"http://thewire.in/51740/kashmir-young-paying-governments-lack-vision/\">saved lives</a>\u201d: \u201cIt is unfortunate that there have been eye injuries but the pellets are less lethal than getting hit by bullets.\u201d</p> <p>So we might ask: what if the armed forces stationed in Kashmir had fired live bullets instead? <em>Imagine the death toll!</em> But this doesn\u2019t compute: in 2016, the security forces have already killed nearly 100 civilians. Is that an acceptable number?</p> <p>In a year or two, as India, and Pakistan, continue to harp on their territorialist positions, there will arrive a season of surface calm \u2013 a \u201creturn to normalcy\u201d \u2013 in Kashmir. People will shop, marry off their children, and celebrate an uncurfewed Eid. They will also welcome tourists in their blighted land.</p> <p>But when this new generation of freedom-seekers grows up into blinded, maimed, adulthood, they will carry our guilt-ridden consciences for us. They will remember more than they have seen. They will certainly remember the country that did this to them.</p> <p>\u2022 Follow the Long Read on Twitter at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/@gdnlongread\">@gdnlongread</a>, or sign up to the long read weekly email <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2015/jul/20/sign-up-to-the-long-read-email\">here</a>.</p>",

Not a subtle moue of displeasure from behind an expensive pair of cufflinks, but a bluntly put, publicly issued ransom. At the end of September the boss of Nissan, Carlos Ghosn, goes to one of the car industry\u2019s biggest annual events, the Paris Motor Show, and declares to reporters that Brexit means the UK now has to cut him \u201ca deal\u201d. If cars made in Britain are to face tariffs on export to Europe, he wants \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/sep/30/nissan-hard-brexit-compensation-new-uk-investment-tariffs\" title=\"\">some kind of compensation</a>\u201d.</p> <p>Extraordinary: one of the biggest manufacturers in Britain effectively wants danger money to carry on investing here. Even more remarkably, Nissan has behind it the full might of the Japanese government, which sent 15 pages of demands on behalf of some of the country\u2019s biggest businesses \u2013 along with the veiled threat to pull out of the UK.</p> <p>Faster than you can say Micra, Ghosn is invited to Downing Street. Within two weeks he has a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/14/nissan-chief-executive-carlos-ghosn-meets-theresa-may-brexit-talks\" title=\"\">face-to-face with the prime minister</a>. The UK has just opted to sever four decades of relations with its biggest trading partner, the government has no fiscal policy and her own party is in turmoil \u2013 yet May still clears her diary for the Nissan boss.</p> <p>Then, a few days back, Ghosn announces Sunderland will not only carry on working, but <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/27/nissan-to-make-new-qashqai-and-x-trail-models-in-britain\" title=\"\">will now make the new-model Qashqai</a>. The obvious question is: what did his company get from our government? Yet business secretary Greg Clark refuses to divulge any detail of how much or even <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/27/new-nissan-super-plant-hopes-for-tariff-free-eu-access\" title=\"\">what kind of taxpayer support has been offered</a> to Nissan \u2013 after all, it\u2019s only our money. Instead, he waves off the deal as just a slightly prickly chat in the senior common room.</p> <p>\u201cOne can overcomplicate these things,\u201d he airily tells MPs at the end of October. A mere month after Ghosn made his initial threat, what apparently <a href=\"https://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?id=2016-10-31b.687.3\" title=\"\">changed his mind</a> was the government\u2019s \u201cintention to find common ground and to pursue discussions in a rational and civilised way\u201d.</p> <p>To say this doesn\u2019t add up is beside the point: it\u2019s not meant to. Clark and May obviously don\u2019t want a rival carmaker or any other multinational operating in Britain to know how far they will go to keep them onshore. But if the multimillionaire boss of a \u00a333bn auto giant only wanted a \u201crational and civilised\u201d discussion, , he could try a Melvyn Bragg podcast. The Qashqai has been a massive seller for Nissan; the company would not have opted to make the next model out of Sunderland merely on the basis of some comforting ministerial purrs.</p> <p><a href=\"http://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-britain-eu-nissan-support-idUKKCN12R2FI\" title=\"\">A source</a> tells Reuters that \u201cthe government gave Nissan a written commitment of extra support in the event Brexit reduces its competitiveness\u201d. The carmaker itself acknowledges that its executive committee made its decision upon receiving the \u201csupport and assurances of the UK government\u201d. And the former deputy prime minister, Nick Clegg, warns that such deals could cost the taxpayer \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/30/nissans-post-brexit-deal-could-lead-to-colossal-bills-for-taxpayers\" title=\"\">colossal amounts of money</a>\u201d. How much? Were the EU to slap on 10% extra on British-made cars, the tariff bill for Nissan UK alone would come to just shy of \u00a3300m a year. If May and Clark were to try to cover half of that, they would be extending an unprecedented level of subsidy to just one company.

First the threat, then the bargain, and finally, with unministerial haste, an expensive handshake behind closed doors. Each time, the public will be none the wiser, even as their government commits them to perhaps costly support for some company or sector, each one claiming strategic importance. And don\u2019t think it will stop at cars.</p> <p>Within 48 hours of the Brexit vote, the National Farmers\u2019 Union was preparing for an extraordinary meeting of its council to draw up demands for Downing Street. Top of the list was the \u00a32.4bn in subsidies that farmers get each year from Brussels. Within weeks, the new chancellor Philip Hammond was promising to carry on the handouts until the end of this decade. He made similar offers to universities and businesses reliant on EU grants.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Almost inevitably, the British state becomes even more of a milch-cow for big businesses</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Put these numbers in context. Starting this week, the government will cut the benefits it gives to 88,000 families. That is huge turmoil \u2013 and it will cut just \u00a3100m from the welfare bill. Yet at the same time, billions are being committed to keep sweet businesses from the pharmaceutical giants to the landowners of the south-west.</p> <p>These are businesses that have already done very well out of taxpayers. Consider Nissan UK: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/kevin-farnsworth\" title=\"\">Kevin Farnsworth</a>, lecturer in social policy at the University of York and an expert on government subsidies, calculates that over the past two decades it has taken \u00a3782m in loans, grants and handouts from the British and European public. In upfront cash transfers alone that comes to \u00a3130m.</p> <p>Farnsworth has calculated this figure by combing Nissan accounts as well as the grant documents from the British government and its various agencies. He has compiled a <a href=\"http://staging.corporate-welfare-watch.org.uk/wp/\" title=\"\">database</a> for other major businesses, to be found at corporate-welfare-watch.org.uk.</p> <p>Where this takes you is to the dirty secret of the British business model. From Margaret Thatcher onwards, successive governments have lured multinational investors by promising them access to the single market, a cheap, biddable workforce and a bunch of corporate sweeteners. It was the same offer Dublin made to the tax avoiders of Silicon Valley and \u2013 within its own narrow confines \u2013 it worked. As Farnsworth points out, Britain has reliably taken in proportionately more foreign direct investment than most of its competitors.</p> <p>The problem is that now the UK can no longer guarantee access to 500&#xa0;million European consumers, it will need to make its workers cheaper and even more flexible and offer more handouts.</p> <p>Surveying this debacle, it strikes me that Lord Acton got it wrong. It\u2019s not power that corrupts; it\u2019s powerlessness. What do you bargain with, when three decades of deregulation and weakening of local and central government mean you have hardly any cards left in your hand? Almost inevitably, the British state becomes even more of a milch-cow for big businesses. Forget about foreigners coming over here and taking our benefits; now think about multinationals cherry-picking our benefits. That trade-off isn\u2019t rhetorical: it\u2019s real. That money will come from our social security, our hospitals, our schools. Brexit Britain: a soft touch for corporate welfare. Is this what was meant by control?</p> <p>\u2022 Comments will be turned on later this morning</p>",

Difficulty getting enough staff could have a severe impact, it said. </p> <p>Staff shortages are so common that almost one in 10 (8%) consultant posts in NHS breast radiology services are unfilled and a quarter of breast cancer screening programme units operate with just two or one breast radiologists, according to RCR surveys. </p> <p>\u201cThe skill of breast radiologists in interpreting mammograms and other complex scans is vital to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/jun/03/breast-cancer-screening-risk-death-research-mammograms\">early detection and diagnosis of breast cancer</a>, as well as in the delivery of cancer screening programmes. Without more breast radiologists to tackle this increasing demand we cannot hope to achieve the best possible health outcomes for patients,\u201d said Dr Hilary Dobson, the chair of the British Society of Breast Radiology.</p> <p>A separate report, by the breast cancer screening programme itself, found that15% of posts among radiographers in England who carry out mammograms were unfilled and that 65% of screening units had vacancies for such staff.
