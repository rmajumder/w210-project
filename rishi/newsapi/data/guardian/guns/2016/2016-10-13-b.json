  "<p>The Obama administration has announced details of an ambitious set of plans to collect comprehensive national data on fatal police encounters, and has said it will also attempt to collect records of non-lethal use of force incidents.</p> <p>Since the fatal police shooting of unarmed African American teenager Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, the federal government has come under increasing pressure to collect accurate data on police use of deadly force. This pressure intensified in 2015 following the launch of the Guardian\u2019s ongoing project, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/series/counted-us-police-killings\">The Counted</a>, which logs all officer-involved deaths through a model of verified crowdsourcing.</p> <p>The US attorney general, Loretta Lynch, said on Thursday that such data was \u201cessential to an informed and productive discussion about community-police relations\u201d as she revealed further details of an FBI scheme, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/dec/09/fbi-launch-new-system-count-people-killed-police-officers-the-counted\">announced in 2015</a>, to try to collect official use of force records from police departments around the US. </p> <p>\u201cThe initiatives we are announcing today are vital efforts toward increasing transparency and building trust between law enforcement and the communities we serve,\u201d Lynch said in a statement.</p> <p>The FBI pilot scheme will begin in 2017 and is due to include around 178,557 officers in some of the nation\u2019s largest police departments, as well as some federal and state law enforcement agencies.</p> <p>Individual departments will be asked to report virtually every time they use force through an online portal. As part of the trial, agencies will also voluntarily forward original records to the FBI, so that federal officials can see whether local officers are using the tool correctly. </p> <p>\u201cThe goal of this review is to ascertain whether the agencies are applying the definitions and using the provided instructions in a uniform manner,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2016/10/05/2016-24173/agency-information-collection-activities-proposed-ecollection-ecomments-requested-a-newly-approved\">according to the proposal</a>.</p> <p>The FBI\u2019s expansive new system goes a step further than previous data collection attempts because it will track non-lethal force in addition to police killings. Every month, agencies will be asked to report each incident in which force caused death or serious bodily injury as well as every time officers fire a gun \u201cat or in the direction of\u201d a person.</p> <p>The second phase of the trial program will include on-site visits to some of the involved agencies to \u201cascertain the level and source of underreporting of within-scope incidents\u201d.</p> <p>If the program is extended beyond the pilot to include all US departments, it will face a major limitation: reporting the data to the FBI will remain voluntary. This means that many police departments could simply opt out of reporting altogether and skew the national count. Voluntary reporting has been a significant constraint on past attempts to count police use of force. </p> <p>A DoJ spokesman explained that mandating police departments to report use of force data via the FBI\u2019s online portal would require an act of Congress. In 2014, Congress did pass the Death in Custody Reporting Act, which mandates states and federal agencies to report in-custody deaths or risk losing federal funding. But that law has never been enforced, and doesn\u2019t apply to non-lethal uses of force.<strong> </strong></p> <p>Previous attempts by the FBI have relied on local police departments\u2019 voluntary adherence to a scheme attempting to collect data only on \u201cjustifiable homicides\u201d. In 2014 the FBI recorded just 444 of these deaths, a figure that was widely regarded as unreliable<a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/oct/15/fbi-record-police-killings-tamir-rice-eric-garner\"> as hundreds of departments failed to report their records</a>. In 2015, the Guardian recorded 1,146 fatalities. The Counted has logged 847 deaths so far in 2016.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t have the power to require people to supply us with data,\u201d the FBI director, James Comey, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/dec/09/fbi-police-killings-database-change\">said in 2015</a>, in the wake of harsh criticism of the bureau\u2019s flawed count.</p> <p>Last year, Comey said it was \u201c<a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/oct/08/fbi-chief-says-ridiculous-guardian-washington-post-better-information-police-shootings\">embarrassing and ridiculous</a>\u201d that the Guardian and the Washington Post, which runs a similar project documenting only police shootings, had better records than his own department.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>On Thursday, Lynch said that the department would attempt to navigate around the lack of a statutory framework by partnering more closely with a range of law enforcement bodies around the country and hinted the department could fine states who do not comply.</p> <p>The justice department\u2019s data collection arm, the Bureau of Justice statistics, is running a concurrent scheme that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/dec/13/justice-department-database-police-killings-counted-statistics\">more closely mirrors the Guardian\u2019s methodology and has already begun a pilot phase</a>. The BJS will track all arrest-related deaths, including deaths following force by law enforcement and those from natural causes and suicide. The BJS pilot does not depend on agencies to voluntarily report fatalities, but instead works to confirm media reports and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/08/police-officer-related-deaths-department-of-justice\">requires local police</a> to provide additional details.</p>",
  "<p>When England travelled to Bangladesh two weeks ago, there were many reasons why they could have lost the ODI leg \u2013 and in the course of the series they created a few more. Absent players, ever-improving opposition, alien conditions, crowds wishing them the worst, the suffocating \u2013 if superb, and inescapable \u2013 security detail and some overemotional aggro all popped up at one stage or another. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/oct/12/england-bangladesh-third-odi-match-report\" title=\"\">England\u2019s greenhorns passed their test</a>, however.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/oct/12/jos-buttler-england-odi-series-win-bangladesh-ben-stokes\">Jos Buttler says England\u2019s ODI series win in Bangladesh is \u2018hugely satisfying\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The captain, Jos Buttler, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/oct/12/jos-buttler-england-odi-series-win-bangladesh-ben-stokes\" title=\"\">said immediately after the ODI series victory:</a> \u201cWhat we have achieved here should not be underestimated.\u201d He was right \u2013 Bangladesh is no longer a tour to be sneered at or for top players to rest up on beaches. It should also not be underestimated the mental barrier these players \u2013 some on their first full tour, many in Bangladesh for the first time \u2013 had to cross to play the series in the first place. Let alone 20-somethings, as the assistant coach, Paul Farbrace, put it: \u201cFor some of us who have been around for a while it\u2019s still been quite an interesting, daunting trip.\u201d</p> <p>For that reason, Farbrace said of Buttler, who has looked at home, both as a statesman and a tactician: \u201cI don\u2019t think you could get a tougher series to start off with as captain.\u201d</p> <p>On the field, Buttler, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/oct/10/england-captain-jos-buttler-icc-bangladesh-mashrafe-mortaza-cricket\" title=\"\">despite his skirmish in Mirpur</a>, has been impressive; his fields have been imaginative and his deployment of his spinners, particularly Adil Rashid, smart. His batting has developed a new gear, too, seen best in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/oct/09/mashrafe-mortaza-leads-bangladesh-to-victory-over-england-to-level-series\" title=\"\">the defeat in the second ODI</a>: the risk-averse accumulator still ruthlessly zipping along at a run a ball. Each time he was at the crease his team looked in utter control, which goes some way to explaining the glee with which Bangladesh celebrated his wicket in Mirpur.</p> <p>However, as Farbrace said: \u201cThe cricket challenge is only one side.\u201d Buttler has dealt with increased media duties and the tough gig of selector (and bearer of bad news), too. He spoke about struggling to harness the emotional side of his role and by Chittagong he seemed to have done just that, although he and Sam Billings \u2013 the two worst watchers \u2013 were said to be pacing the room, rifling through their kitbags as the decider headed for the wire. The idea that Buttler is a softie has been dispelled for good.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/oct/13/eoin-morgan-resume-england-odi-captaincy-india-bangladesh\">Eoin Morgan will resume England limited-overs captaincy in India</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Buttler\u2019s sidekick Ben Stokes has never been accused of softness but he was another to revel in his new role, as Farbrace neatly summed up: \u201cVice-captain or not, he is a leader and wherever he goes, people want to go with him, where he\u2019s going out for dinner, when he\u2019s practising.\u201d Stokes\u2019 two most mature white-ball innings came in England\u2019s two wins, while he could perhaps have bowled more.</p> <p>In the second game in Mirpur, England\u2019s leaders were drawn into a pointless ruckus; as much as Buttler and Stokes looked petty in failing to rise above provocation, the direction of the sanctions dished out by the match referee was instructive, as was Tamim Iqbal seeking out Jason Roy at the end of the series to apologise for what he had said. The heat had told but by Chittagong England had allowed the brouhaha to pass and their heads were screwed back on.</p> <p>A series win \u2013 but hardly a romp \u2013 allowed Farbrace to reflect that, despite the management\u2019s initial anger, it was \u201cprobably even a good thing that some didn\u2019t come\u201d. Eoin Morgan and Alex Hales will be back in India, and so will Joe Root. Ben Duckett and Billings, so impressive here and surely now ahead of Jonny Bairstow and James Vince, will likely have to wait for their chance once more.Long-created pecking orders are not smashed in 2-1 series wins, especially when the powers that be gave the absentees the right to withdraw.</p> <p>Change will not come now but the message from Farbrace was that no one is untouchable and this series reinforced the depth at England\u2019s disposal, especially among batters, but Jake Ball\u2019s rise was encouraging, too. \u201cEvery player in the squad knows that there is serious quality,\u201d said Farbrace, with surely half an eye on Morgan. If form does catch up on him, or any of the other batsmen, England know they are well placed. Every player, in and out of the XI, is slightly more on his toes.</p> <p>Even if it has muddied the selection waters, England will leave Bangladesh knowing plenty more about their roguish band of tyros.</p> <p>The abiding sense that each tourist took plenty from it \u2013 be that the long hours bonding over matches of Fifa on a games console, to the experience on unfamiliar tracks in hostile (in every sense) climes, to the accelerated development of being thrust into a leadership role \u2013 was backed up by Farbrace, who said: \u201cFor a lot of young blokes it\u2019s been a good learning experience. So many people go away from here better for it \u2013 and we have another win, which is what we were here for.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>High fences, security cameras, razor wire and gatehouse vehicle checks: modern Premier League training grounds often seem more like military installations than offshoots of the entertainment industry. If some of the protection and privacy is necessary, many clubs embrace effective \u201clockdown mode\u201d a little too enthusiastically and David Moyes is suitably concerned about the resultant disconnect between players, supporters and reporters.</p> <p>It explains why, this week, Sunderland\u2019s manager threw open the doors of his club\u2019s magnificently appointed, if slightly windy, training HQ and offered journalists rare \u201caccess all areas\u201d. Managers in charge of struggling clubs \u2013 and Sunderland are bottom of the table, with no Premier League wins and only two points this season \u2013 traditionally adopt siege mentalities but defying convention, Moyes allowed his guests to watch an entire training session as he prepared for Saturday\u2019s fixture at Stoke City.</p> <p>The manager became happily accustomed to staging daily \u201copen training\u201d during his time coaching Real Sociedad in La Liga, and Jermain Defoe is similarly familiar with the concept. The former England striker certainly had no inhibitions about showing off his extraordinary finishing ability \u2013 crowned by one particularly acrobatic volley \u2013 to an enlarged audience.</p> <p>\u201cIt made a difference, in a good way,\u201d Defoe said. \u201cIt was good for the young lads, having people watch lifts players. They do it all the time in Canada and America, in MLS. When I played for Toronto, reporters talk to you in the changing room. You step out of the shower and there\u2019s a couple of women there.\u201d</p> <p>That may be one step too far for Sunderland but a fully clothed Defoe duly seized an opportunity to challenge the north-east\u2019s often deceptively unflattering image. Back in August Moyes \u2013 the club\u2019s seventh manager in five years \u2013 was shocked when several leading British players including Joe Hart, Jack Wilshere and Ryan Mason rejected mooted moves to Wearside. Despite a recent history studded with near constant 11th-hour relegation escapes, he still cannot quite believe that Sunderland\u2019s regular, fanatical, 40,000\u2011plus crowds, top\u2011drawer infrastructure and illustrious past counted for nothing.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m a real London boy but I\u2019ve loved living up here,\u201d Defoe said. \u201cI\u2019ve enjoyed it and embraced it. It\u2019s a nice area. The only difference is that\u2019s it\u2019s colder. Everything else is just an excuse and if you love football, you can\u2019t make&#xa0;excuses.</p> <p>\u201cIf you love playing football, if you want to play in front of amazing fans in a big stadium, at a club with fantastic training facilities then put some tracksuit bottoms on and come and play for Sunderland. Making excuses is a soft way out.\u201d</p> <p>Defoe concedes that he, too, once had \u201ca different perception,\u201d of the north-east. \u201cBut that was before Toronto,\u201d he says. \u201cUntil then I thought it was too cold \u2018up north\u2019. Then I went to Canada. The cold there. Wow. After that, Sunderland\u2019s tropical.\u201d</p> <p>The heat is already on Moyes, with many pundits forecasting relegation. \u201cWe know we have to improve but there\u2019s a long way to go,\u201d Defoe said. \u201cIt\u2019s not a situation you want to be in but it\u2019s nothing new to us; maybe other teams would panic more in our position. If the whole team sticks together we\u2019ll be fine. If we win at Stoke, we\u2019re up and running.\u201d The 34-year-old is encouraged by the squad\u2019s surprisingly resilient morale. \u201cThere\u2019s some good characters here. The spirit\u2019s always been good, the spirit\u2019s not the problem.\u201d</p> <p>Quality is a different matter and his efforts to make Sunderland much more than the sum of their parts have sometimes reduced Defoe to on-pitch tears after scoring key goals. \u201cIt\u2019s just the emotion of such important games,\u201d the striker said.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s because we needed the points so bad it was scary. We\u2019ve got a good thing here, relegation would be a shame.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve always felt we have so much more to give, that we can improve and push on. Those times I\u2019ve cried, it\u2019s because it means so much for me to be here and scoring goals. It\u2019s special here.\u201d</p> <p>Moyes is similarly frustrated by his enduring struggle to unlock Sunderland\u2019s potential but Defoe points out that it is still only three months since he succeeded Sam Allardyce and improvements will inevitably be incremental.</p> <p>Significantly, insiders say the Scot is their most \u201chands-on\u201d manager in years and talk of his enthusiasm for breathing new life into this doziest of sleeping giants in much the same way that Rafael Ben\u00edtez is revitalising Newcastle United.</p> <p>Certainly watching Moyes work as the focal point of training \u2013 variously instructing Patrick van Aanholt to \u201ctrack back\u2019 at breakneck speed and shouting \u201clove it\u201d as 14 consecutive passes are registered during an exercise in close control under pressure \u2013 is to see vision and commitment shining through the October gloom. \u201cIt\u2019s been difficult,\u201d Defoe said. \u201cBut you can\u2019t just come into a club and make it click overnight. There\u2019s a new way of playing and it was always going to take time to build something. Hopefully the manager will get time.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>In 1974, a 29-year-old Florida TV news journalist called Christine Chubbuck killed herself with a gun to the head, live on air; she was suffering from severe depression about her love life and the way macho-sensational news values were crowding out the stories she wanted to do. The video footage was confined to the company vault and has still never been seen. </p> <p>She was said to have inspired the 1976 movie <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/apr/12/philip-french-classic-dvd-network-sidney-lumet-faye-dunaway-peter-finch\">Network</a>, although screenwriter Paddy Chayefsky denied it, and in fact this eerie and disturbing case has been largely forgotten until now, when two movies have come along. One is Antonio Campos\u2019s forthcoming drama <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/jan/24/christine-review-rebecca-hall-astonishes-in-real-life-horror-story\">Christine</a>, with Rebecca Hall in the title role.

Only after an hour and a half of this does Sheil talk to people who knew Chubbuck and we see some of her archive footage. </p> <p>Then we come to the crunch. There is one sharp contribution from veteran news anchor John Hill, who thinks the whole thing is prurient: \u201cIt was a total waste of time \u2026 a total waste of the people who continue to talk about it, because it accomplished nothing, it didn\u2019t help reset anything with women in this business.\u201d</p>",

Their concerns about diminished social and economic status, the failure of their communities and families and the general sense of abandonment are treated as collateral damage by elites, who condescend to them without actually understanding the cause of their pain.<br></p> <p>Bob Dylan\u2019s art, at its finest, dignifies those voices. He is not of those communities by origin, but he has embraced them so deeply and consistently through his six-decade career that he speaks on their behalf with clarity, conviction and authenticity. At the same time, he is an advocate for social justice at the most basic, human level, and in his mature work refuses to reduce either side of a discussion to caricature.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/BryanAGraham/status/786587900896870400\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Joan Baez and Bob Dylan at the March on Washington, 8/28/1963. <a href=\"https://t.co/AgBBzcfmTW\">pic.twitter.com/AgBBzcfmTW</a></p>&mdash; Bryan Armen Graham (@BryanAGraham) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BryanAGraham/status/786587900896870400\">October 13, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57fff18ae4b016012389583a\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-13T20:42:25.857Z\">9.42pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Indeed: </p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/imjasondiamond/status/786667928565452800\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">My timeline is like watching a &quot;Dylan deserved the Nobel&quot; vs. &quot;Dylan didn&#39;t deserve the Nobel&quot; ping pong match.</p>&mdash; Jason Diamond (@imjasondiamond) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/imjasondiamond/status/786667928565452800\">October 13, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57ffed99e4b01ffb8ffcb6c5\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-13T20:32:27.858Z\">9.32pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Tonight, Dylan plays in Vegas.

The whole thing\u2019s great, but here\u2019s a sample paragraph:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>There\u2019s no getting around the fact that, say, Irish poet Seamus Heaney\u2019s Field Work works differently than Blonde on Blonde. An ear for assonance and meter as fine as the one that belonged to <a href=\"http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/literature/laureates/1995/\">the 1995 Nobel winner</a> serves a linguistic pleasure that requires the spatial limits of a blank, white, demanding page. So much of the pleasure I get from Dylan, on the other hand, derives from the voice singing those lyrics. He was never more moving than the decade when his larynx turned into a rusted carburetor; he sang like a carping vulture, and I loved it. <br></p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57ffd450e4b047a4eaafc33f\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-13T18:58:47.595Z\">7.58pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>There are plenty of music writers on Facebook debating Dylan\u2019s win. One of them is our Chicago-based country music writer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/mark-guarino\">Mark Guarino</a>, who has given me permission to quote from his post in defence of Dylan\u2019s win, which is being shared a lot. He writes:</p> <ol> <li>Lyrics are not meant to outlast the music. Dylan\u2019s do. His work fundamentally changed the art form. Today the marketing people would call him a \u201cdisrupter\u201d and a \u201cchange agent.\u201d His use of language is profound, playful and instinctual. Somehow he developed pop music that works well in the back of a bar, but at the same time you can disappear inside the songs and let them work their magic. As great poetry does.</li> <li>He has a body of work that stretches more than 50 years, which is much longer than most contemporary novelists, poets, painters. Even his so-called \u201cbad\u201d period in the 80s contained some of his most evocative writing (Oh Mercy). Joni Mitchell, Smokey Robinson and many others created great work but within very specific time periods. Dylan never stopped. Some of his late career work stands firmly up against Blonde on Blonde. More incredibly, despite great fame he was able to sit down again and again and write with a true eye, which isn\u2019t easy to do. Ask any number of your classic rockers who stopped decades ago.</li> <li>Dylan\u2019s songs live as both highbrow and lowbrow. His fans span truck drivers to Ivy League academics. His songs have meaning to people who heard them in the Woodstock era and to those who heard them during the first Iraq war. There are people who attend his concerts to pump their fists in the air and there are others who quietly count the syllables. For a body of work to be so pliable is the very definition of great literature.</li> <li>Shakespeare wrote plays that have been turned into music, movies, and are performed in garages to great halls. Are not songs simply internal monologues that are sung? Are some novels poetry and some chapbooks novels? Literature is ultimately about the language, not the genre.</li> <li>This prize is affirmation that pop culture can aspire to, and achieve, high art. People thought pop music was for children before Dylan and the Beatles showed up. He fused the folk revival with pop to steer things in a new direction. Now songwriters can aspire to greatness far outside the commercial realm. Indeed into one where so-called \u201cserious\u201d literature exists. \u201cHits\u201d have little to do with what he left behind.</li> <li>Dylan is a humanist. Like Tennessee Williams, he sees our folly. Dylan\u2019s lyrics reflect both deep nihilism about the human state of affairs and sometimes idealism about human encounters, one-on-one. Ever since the advent of the nuclear bomb, he has summed us up pretty well. He isn\u2019t just a writer \u2014 he has a perspective.</li> </ol>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c1fd195302f6a808534200a3a7bc1d812741f3d1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c1fd195302f6a808534200a3a7bc1d812741f3d1/0_0_3000_2279/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Bob Dylan in Pat Garrett &amp; Billy the Kid (for which he also did the soundtrack) which was released in May 1973 and filmed in Durango, Mexico.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"760\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bob Dylan in Pat Garrett &amp; Billy the Kid (for which he also did the soundtrack) which was released in May 1973 and filmed in Durango, Mexico.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Michael Ochs Archives/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57ffd6dbe4b01ffb8ffcb673\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-13T18:48:40.138Z\">7.48pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Rob Delaney\u2019s tweet has also provoked some US arts desk lols:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/robdelaney/status/786563452269654017\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Bob Dylan wins the Nobel Prize for Literature?

He is a great poet. He is a great poet in the English-speaking tradition and he is a wonderful sampler, a very original sampler, he embodies the tradition and for 55, 54 years now he\u2019s been at it and re-inventing himself constantly. Re-inventing himself creating a new identity.<strong><br></strong></p> <p><strong>Q: </strong>Have you talked to him today?<br><strong>Danius: </strong>No, I haven\u2019t. I will afterwards.</p> <p><strong>Q:</strong> He\u2019s not a person who is nice and smiley when he gets awards. That doesn\u2019t worry you?<br><strong>Danius: </strong>No, I think I have a good message.</p> <p><strong>Q: </strong>Do you have personal favourites among his songs?<br><strong>Danius: </strong>I think if you want to start listening, or reading, you may start with Blonde on Blonde, the album from 1966. You\u2019ve got many classics and it\u2019s an extraordinary example of his brilliant way of rhyming and putting together refrains and his pictorial thinking.</p> <p><strong>Q:</strong> He\u2019s not written novels, not poetry in the usual sense, you have widened the horizon.<br><strong>Danius: </strong>It may look that way but really we haven\u2019t in a way if you look back, far back, 2500 years or so, you discover Homer and Sappho and they wrote poetic texts that were meant to be listened to. They were meant to be performed, often together with instruments, and it\u2019s the same way with Bob Dylan. But we still read Homer and Sappho and we enjoyed it [sic], we enjoy it and the same thing with Bob Dylan he can be read and should be read and he is a great poet in the English tradition, in the grand English poetic tradition.</p> <p><strong>Q:</strong> Do you think there will be criticism against this prize?<br><strong>Danius: </strong>I hope not [smiles]. </p> <p><strong>Q: </strong>When you were young and into pop rock music, which I guess you were, did you listen a lot to Bob Dylan?<br><strong>Danius: </strong>Not really, but he was always around, so I know the music. I\u2019ve started to appreciate him much more now than I did. I was a big David Bowie fan. Perhaps it is a question of generation, I don\u2019t know.

Dylan is young, and admits it. He is naive and implies it at stations along his particular line. He is committed; yet what is a poet for these luminous days, when illumination may come from the clash of cobalt and iodine, if not to be committed? The same was said of Pound, Auden and MacNeice; the same is true to day of poets like Christopher Logue, Adrian Mitchell and George MacBeth. The difference is that Dylan is not a readers\u2019 poet: some but by no means all of his verse is able to stand by itself but more commonly it needs musical backing and the strangely dry, bitter quality of his voice to supply the dimension that other poets derive from literal organisation.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-10-13T14:39:40.041Z\">at 3.39pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57ff9579e4b01ffb8ffcb511\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-13T14:15:24.065Z\">3.15pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Joyce Carol Oates puts her voice behind Dylan:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/JoyceCarolOates/status/786565703411175430\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Asked about Nobel for Dylan: inspired &amp; original choice. his haunting music &amp; lyrics have always seemed, in the deepest sense, &quot;literary.&quot;</p>&mdash; Joyce Carol Oates (@JoyceCarolOates) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JoyceCarolOates/status/786565703411175430\">October 13, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>Meanwhile discussion is turning to which other songwriters might have merited a Nobel.

  "<p>The 2016-17 European rugby campaign is upon us. Good luck to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/oct/13/european-champions-cup-2016-17-pool-by-pool-guide\" title=\"\">all competing clubs</a> and, in particular, travelling fans from the UK as they prepare to exchange their weakened sterling for euros. Half a week\u2019s wages for a round of gaseous French lager? Had the referendum literature mentioned the possibility of teetotal rugby weekends there might have been a different outcome.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/oct/13/european-champions-cup-2016-17-pool-by-pool-guide\">European Champions Cup 2016-17: pool-by-pool guide | Paul Rees</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It is just another reason why the tournament organisers are praying more than ever for a gripping start to their competitions this weekend. Last season, with the World Cup squeezing the fixture list, no Irish teams in the last eight for the first time since 1997-98 and the semi-finals attracting a combined attendance of only 38,968 spectators, a gripping sense of theatre was not always discernible. European club rugby knows it cannot afford its supposed flagship event to be anything less than vibrant.</p> <p>Small wonder, therefore, that Simon Halliday, the chairman of European Professional Club Rugby (EPCR), has been visiting the Irish and Italian contingent, among others, to offer support. He found the Irish provinces in quietly determined mood, keen to use last year\u2019s underachievement as a motivational springboard.</p> <p>\u201cThey have a clear view of where they want to go,\u201d said Halliday. \u201cYes they can see strength in the English and French club games but money does not buy you everything. Bath wouldn\u2019t be in the Challenge Cup otherwise. You\u2019ve got to be really careful about saying the monied clubs are the ones that always win.\u201d</p> <p>He also argues the calibre of the clubs in the Challenge Cup \u2013 Bath, Stade Fran\u00e7ais, Harlequins, Ospreys, Cardiff \u2013 is proof the more meritocratic qualifying process for the Champions Cup is driving up standards generally. Maybe, but the presence of just one Welsh team in the premier tournament for the first time is unsettling, particularly given Italy are still guaranteed an entrant. Zebre remain rooted to the foot of the Pro12 table and, for all the collective desire to see Italian rugby thrive, it remains a weakness that two sides will almost inevitably emerge from Pool 2.</p> <p>Halliday stresses it would require unanimous board agreement to make any \u201cserious structural changes\u201d to the current tournament agreement, which still has another six seasons to run. This effectively means Italian representation is safe unless their teams were to become dangerously weak. \u201cIf there were reasons to change anything it would start to become obvious and self-fulfilling,\u201d said Halliday. \u201cAs I said in my best Italian: \u2018We want you to be strong, we\u2019ll do anything to help you.\u2019 There are rumblings of a better situation developing there.\u201d</p> <p>What might change, though not this season, is a return to automatic Champions Cup qualification for the Challenge Cup champions. Montpellier benefited from that route last season because the World Cup rendered end-of-season play-offs impractical and <a href=\"http://www.epcrugby.com/europeanrugbychampionscup/qualification/index.php\" title=\"\">this season\u2019s shootout</a> between the seventh-placed sides in the Premiership and Top 14 and the eighth and ninth-placed sides in the Pro12 may be the last amid continuing discussions about the shape of the global fixture calendar.</p> <p>There is also a continuing desire for the Champions Cup winners and their Super Rugby counterparts to face each other \u2013 previous efforts have not been endorsed by EPCR \u2013 and to take the final to new locations, with Italy and Spain both candidates. This season\u2019s finale, though, will be on familiar turf, with Murrayfield due to host for the third time. Toulouse and Leinster triumphed on the previous two occasions but this year\u2019s pretenders will first have to escape the recent stranglehold of Saracens and Toulon.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/oct/12/owen-farrell-return-saracens-toulon-european-rugby-champions-cup\">Owen Farrell likely to return for Saracens against Toulon after injury</a> </p> </aside>  <p>With the two heavyweights meeting in the opening round of pool games on Saturday, the pressure on the defending champions Saracens is immediate on a ground where Toulon have never lost in this competition. \u201cWhat happened last year doesn\u2019t come into it,\u201d said Mark McCall, Sarries\u2019 director of rugby. \u201cBut we have a group who love these occasions and it brings the best out of them. They won\u2019t be intimidated by it, they will thrive on it.\u201d</p> <p>McCall, even so, thinks it may be tougher for the English clubs than last season when five Premiership sides made the quarter-finals. \u201cLast year was&#xa0;different because of the World Cup \u2026 this time it might not be like that.\u201d He&#xa0;is not wrong, with Leicester braced for an instant test of character in Glasgow on Friday. Saracens and Wasps could be the only Premiership sides to make the last eight, alongside four French sides \u2013 Racing 92, Toulon, Montpellier, Clermont \u2013 and, possibly, two Irish provinces in Leinster and Connacht. \u201cIf you talk to [the owner] Jacky Lorenzetti he\u2019s got a view about where Racing are going and it\u2019s not sideways or down,\u201d said Halliday.</p> <p>Saracens remain my tip to retain the trophy but the high road to Scotland will require careful navigation.</p>",

To achieve this the ABC has put out a tender for Lean Six Sigma training.</p> <p>According to tender documents, between 2017 and 2020 the successful tenderer will train dozens of senior executives who will then gain their white, yellow, green and black belts. With its roots in manufacturing at the Motorola Company in the 1980s, Lean Six Sigma has less to do with judo and more to do with management skills. The system is aimed at maximising business success \u2013 for example, making sure that only three lightbulbs in one million are faulty or that your call times to a customer service line are only a few minutes long. How this system is useful in a creative industry and a public broadcasting environment is unclear. </p> <p>\u201cLean Six Sigma is a well-established business methodology used by organisations globally to simplify and streamline their processes,\u201d an ABC spokesman told Weekly Beast. \u201cThe ABC is implementing this training as part of its ongoing commitment to continuous improvement.\u201d Guthrie is making a rare public appearance at the National Ethnic and Multicultural Broadcasters\u2019 Council national conference next month, where she is giving the keynote.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/sep/16/michelle-guthrie-pushes-abc-executives-to-go-for-the-x-factor\">Michelle Guthrie pushes ABC executives to go for the X-factor</a> </p> </aside>  <h2>Go by the board</h2> <p> After a long career in the media running magazines for ACP, Emap and Fairfax, and as chief executive for Private Media, which publishes Crikey, Marina Go is walking away next month for a new non-executive life sitting on corporate boards.

Theresa May\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/05/mays-conservative-party-conference-speech-key-points-analysed\" title=\"\">insistence that the EU referendum gives her a mandate</a> that could remove Britain from the European single market \u2013 and prerogative powers to achieve it \u2013 has proved to be a serious, perhaps ultimately even a fatal, piece of overreach and a blood transfusion to the opposition. As unintended consequences go, it doesn\u2019t get much bigger&#xa0;than this.</p> <p>May\u2019s approach to Brexit has roused parliament from 100 days of post-referendum uncertainty. It has put <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/10/labour-mps-clash-with-corbyn-over-brexit-and-sacking-of-chief-whip\" title=\"\">a bit of life into the Labour party</a>.

It has enraged the Scottish nationalists. And it has shown all three that they not only have a common interest in stopping it from happening, but that they can also achieve it by cooperating in the Westminster parliament, where they have a majority if they work sensibly.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/24/scotland-oil-money-nationalist-dream-nicola-sturgeon-independence\">The unromantic truth: oil money is vital to the Scottish nationalist cause | Ian Jack</a> </p> </aside>  <p>True, you might not have seen it that way if you had watched the SNP conference leap to its feet in Glasgow today as Nicola Sturgeon <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/13/nicola-sturgeon-challenges-may-with-second-referendum-bill-scottish-independence-snp-conference\" title=\"\">announced that she would publish a new draft independence bill next week</a>. The delegates whooped at the announcement because many of them long for a rerun of the independence vote in September 2014, albeit with a different outcome, and perhaps even thought that was what the first minister had offered. But it is important to understand what Sturgeon didn\u2019t say to them, as well as what she did.</p> <p>Sturgeon did not fire the starting gun on a second independence referendum today. She doesn\u2019t want <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/02/scots-independence-referendum-brexit-nicola-sturgeon\" title=\"\">a second vote</a> unless she thinks she can win it. At the moment she can\u2019t do that. The current polling \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.heraldscotland.com/politics/14798246.Hard_Brexit_is_not_a_game_changer_for_SNP__new_poll_suggests/?commentSort=score\" title=\"\">the latest example was BMG\u2019s poll in the Herald on Friday</a> \u2013 all counsels caution. And, beneath the apparent bravado, caution is what the SNP leader offered.</p> <p>Her words tell that story for anyone who cares to read them carefully. \u201cI am determined,\u201d she said, \u201cthat Scotland will have the ability to reconsider the question of independence \u2013 and to do so before the UK leaves the EU \u2013 if that is necessary to protect our country\u2019s interests.\u201d Sturgeon gave herself more get-out-of-jail options in her speech than she would have had in an open&#xa0;prison.</p> <p>What she actually said elsewhere in her speech is important too. It\u2019s not often you hear a Scottish nationalist leader make an apparently serious offer of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/13/nicola-sturgeon-to-reach-out-to-other-parties-to-fight-hard-brexit\" title=\"\">\u201ccoalition\u201d to Labour, Lib Dem and even moderate Tory leaders</a>. But that\u2019s not what Sturgeon did. She set out a list of Scottish aims, including devolved powers and access to the single market, that are predicated on remaining in the UK, not on breaking free of it, and which can only be achieved with support from others at Westminster. It\u2019s why she said: \u201cToday I want to concentrate on what we will do in the months ahead to protect the interests of Scotland and \u2013 in so far as we can \u2013 of the UK as a whole.\u201d</p> <p>This is in part a tactical stance too, of course. When Sturgeon says the ball is in May\u2019s court she is looking for, perhaps even hoping for, May to overreach again. The SNP are past masters at framing issues in such heads-we-win-tails-you-lose ways. But the pragmatic side of Sturgeon also sees the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/12/brexit-mps-david-davis-eu-exit-plan\" title=\"\">gathering pressure</a> this week for the UK parliament to shape the Brexit process as a chance to achieve serious gains for Scotland without the very real danger of a lost second referendum.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/02/scots-independence-referendum-brexit-nicola-sturgeon\">How do Scots feel about having another independence referendum, post-Brexit? | David Torrance, Vonny Moyes and Mike Small</a> </p> </aside>  <p>One reason why Sturgeon needs to do this is because she is not now quite as popular these days as either her Scottish or her English admirers imagine. It\u2019s not just that Brexit has failed to generate the support for independence that many expected. It\u2019s also that Sturgeon\u2019s own satisfaction ratings among Scots have fallen sharply, <a href=\"https://www.ipsos-mori.com/researchpublications/researcharchive/3781/Brexit-does-not-trigger-significant-increase-in-support-for-independence.aspx\" title=\"\">down by 12 points since April</a>. She now trails the Tories\u2019 Ruth Davidson on satisfaction. The inference is that it is time for Sturgeon to deliver.</p> <p>It is easy to see why some people on both sides of the border have convinced themselves that England and Wales\u2019s Brexit vote might trigger Scotland\u2019s departure from the United Kingdom. Even now, it\u2019s not an outcome that can be wholly dismissed. But the claim is beginning to look seriously incompatible with the facts. Intriguingly, an opposite dynamic may now be the one to watch. Far from separating Scotland from Britain, Brexit may be drawing Scottish nationalism into the heart of British politics in a new&#xa0;and&#xa0;unexpected way.</p> <p>Much of this is down to May\u2019s determined embrace of Brexit and the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/07/take-back-control-brexiteers-immigration-policy-johnson-davis-fox\" title=\"\">appointment of the Brexiteers</a> to key posts in the government. What seemed tactically adept <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jul/16/johnson-davis-fox-three-brexiteers\" title=\"\">in the summer</a> now seems more of a ball and chain, largely because of the studied vagueness of the government\u2019s strategy. But the real catalyst is the gradual dissolution of economic confidence across the UK.</p> <p>Those who said that the foreign exchange markets were the only real opposition to the May government may have had a point a week ago. But a lot has changed in a week. The continuing slide in the pound, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/11/hard-brexit-treasury-66bn-eu-single-market\" title=\"\">the \u00a366bn annual price tag for a hard Brexit</a>, and then the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/13/great-marmite-war-reality-brexit-bite\" title=\"\">temporary disappearance of Marmite from Tesco shelves</a> all added to the sense that the May government is fiddling while British business burns. Public opinion has not had remorse about the referendum result yet, but that may change, opening up some political space for&#xa0;opponents&#xa0;of&#xa0;Brexit.</p> <p>This presents a real rallying opportunity for pro-European and soft-Brexit forces alike. Sturgeon sniffs that opportunity. But the battle will be fought at Westminster, not Holyrood. This is uncomfortable from an SNP perspective; the party is always happiest haranguing from its home base at Holyrood, not wheeling and dealing at distant Westminster. But the votes and the power to change things are at Westminster and Whitehall. The election this week of the party\u2019s Westminster leader <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-37640935\" title=\"\">Angus Robertson as Sturgeon\u2019s new deputy</a> is another reminder that the centre of gravity of Scottish politics has in some ways been shifting to London since 2015.</p> <p>The big question is whether the opposition parties and the moderate Tories at Westminster have the programme, as well as the votes, to change the May government\u2019s direction on Brexit. At this early stage, they have shown they have the power to put a divided government\u2019s nose out of joint. Now they have to agree some shared red lines and to mobilise to promote them at every turn. That will be harder. It will involve creativity, as well as give and take. But the phoney war on Brexit is over, and British politics has at long last got real&#xa0;once&#xa0;again.</p>",

Cook said the US military had already downgraded its targeting efforts following a failed attempt at a ceasefire this summer, but maintained a \u201cfusion cell\u201d with the Saudis. </p> <p>Many see the Yemen conflict as a proxy war between the Middle East\u2019s two main rivals, Saudi Arabia and Iran, and their western or regional backers. Houthi fighters, who are loyal the former president Ali Abdullah Saleh, have also launched indiscriminate shelling in Yemen during the conflict, as well as retaliating with missile attacks on Saudi Arabia. This week, there were reports that Houthi missiles have struck deeper into Saudi Arabia, including striking the Taif airbase near Mecca.</p> <p>Rafat Al-Akhali, a former Yemeni minister of youth and sports, said the US decision to target radar sites would further complicate the conflict. <br></p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s a concerning development; it just further complicates things,\u201d he said. \u201cWe do not understand what exactly happened and what was the attack that prompted this response, and the details are unclear on all sides, but if anything it means that rather than working towards finding a solution and ceasefire and peace agreement, it could signal that things are just getting more complicated.\u201d<br></p> <p>He said millions of Yemenis had not been paid for at least two months. \u201cSince August, literally millions of people across the country, everyone from north to south, has been affected,\u201d he said. \u201cNobody was paid in September, and the majority were not paid in August. The monthly salary is small amount but that has been the only means preventing famine. That\u2019s the biggest challenge that everyone is facing.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Donald Trump scrambled to dig himself out from an avalanche of fresh abuse allegations on Thursday after a series of women came forward to dispute his claim that his comments about sexual assault were only empty boasts.</p> <p>The torrent of accusations, which includes <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/12/donald-trump-miss-usa-dressing-room-2001-rehearsal\">claims from beauty pageant contenders</a> who allege he burst into their dressing rooms to ogle them while they were nude, added nearly a dozen new names to the tally of women who have accused the Republican nominee of inappropriate behavior. </p> <p>Many say they were galvanised into speaking by Trump\u2019s denials during Sunday\u2019s presidential debate, where he dismissed a recording of him bragging about groping women as \u201clocker room talk\u201d and insisted they were \u201cwords not action\u201d.</p> <p>But with allegations to the contrary casting an ever-growing shadow over the campaign, Trump instead sought to dismiss the accusations as a vast establishment conspiracy, orchestrated by his opponent Hillary Clinton \u201cas part of a concerted, coordinated and vicious attack\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThere is nothing the political establishment will not do, no lie they won\u2019t tell to hold their prestige and power at your expense and that\u2019s what\u2019s happening,\u201d he told a rally in Florida. \u201cThe establishment has trillions of dollars at stake in this election.\u201d</p> <p>After a series of initial denials in capital letters on Twitter and more than an hour after his speech was due to start, Trump launched into an hour-long attack on the media and female accusers he called \u201chorrible, horrible liars\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cTake a look. Look at her. Look at her words. And you tell me what you think. I don\u2019t think so,\u201d Trump said of Natasha Stoynoff, a People magazine reporter <a href=\"http://people.com/politics/donald-trump-attacked-people-writer/\">who alleged he had \u201cforced his tongue down my throat\u201d</a>. </p> <p>The New York Times, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/13/us/politics/donald-trump-women.html?hp&amp;action=click&amp;pgtype=Homepage&amp;clickSource=story-heading&amp;module=first-column-region&amp;region=top-news&amp;WT.nav=top-news\">which quoted another woman alleging Trump \u201cwas like an octopus\u201d</a> who put his hand up her skirt on an aeroplane, was dismissed as peddling \u201cthird-rate journalism\u201d on the instructions of the Clinton campaign. Trump threatened to sue the paper over the article. </p> <p>And while the Guardian <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/12/donald-trump-miss-usa-dressing-room-2001-rehearsal\">has interviewed a former beauty contestant who claimed he deliberately walked in on two young Miss USA 2001 contestants while they were naked</a>, Trump portrayed himself as a martyr.</p> <p>\u201cI never knew it would be this vile, this vicious,\u201d he told the crowd in Florida. \u201cNevertheless I take all of these slings and arrows gladly for you. I take them for the movement so we can have our country back.\u201d</p> <p>He added: \u201cI will not allow the Clinton machine to turn our campaign into a discussion of their slanders and lies, but will remain focused on the American people. The only thing Clinton has going for her is the press. Without the press she is nothing.\u201d</p> <p>Nevertheless, his response to the new claims took up almost the entire speech and Trump refused to take questions on them, dismissing from the room a reporter who asked about them beforehand and calling him \u201ca sleazebag\u201d.</p> <p>The New York Times dismissed his threat to sue in withering terms.</p> <p>\u201cThe essence of a libel claim, of course, is the protection of one\u2019s reputation,\u201d <a href=\"http://www.nytco.com/the-new-york-timess-response-to-donald-trumps-retraction-letter/  \">its lawyer wrote to Trump\u2019s</a>. \u201cNothing in our article has had the slightest effect on the reputation that Mr Trump through his own words and actions has already created for himself.\u201d</p> <p>The campaign insisted it had evidence for bringing its legal action against the New York Times, however.</p> <p>\u201cYour article is reckless, defamatory and constitutes libel per se. It is apparent from, among other things, the timing of the article, that it is nothing more than a politically motivated effort to defeat Mr Trump\u2019s candidacy,\u201d wrote Marc Kasowitz, Trump\u2019s lawyer.</p> <p>Under the US constitution, any suit filed by Trump would be almost certain to be thrown out. American libel law as defined in the 1964 case of New York Times v Sullivan states that any public figure suing for libel must prove a defamatory statement was made with actual malice, \u201cwith knowledge that it was false or with reckless disregard of whether it was false or not\u201d.</p> <p>Trump\u2019s speech in Florida came as even close allies began distancing themselves.<br></p> <p>Newt Gringrich, a leading supporter and surrogate who was considered a potential running mate, described the Republican nominee as sometimes \u201cfrankly pathetic\u201d. \u201cThere\u2019s a big Trump and a little Trump,\u201d the former House speaker told Fox Business. \u201cThe little Trump is frankly pathetic.\u201d</p> <p>Amid reports that his campaign was pulling out of Virginia because it was no longer competitive there, Trump cancelled a Fox News interview planned for Thursday night that was expected to deal with charges against Bill Clinton, while his daughter Ivanka was forced to sit awkwardly during a campaign coffee event as moderators tried to avoid the subject.</p> <p>Democrats also revelled in the campaign\u2019s apparent meltdown. \u201cThis is not normal, this is not politics as usual,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/13/michelle-obama-donald-trump-misconduct-frightening\">Michelle Obama told a rally in New Hampshire</a>. \u201cI can\u2019t believe that I\u2019m saying that a candidate for president of the United States has bragged about sexually assaulting women,\u201d she said. \u201cNo woman deserves to be treated this way \u2013 none of us deserves this kind of abuse.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/oct/13/michelle-obama-speech-donald-trump-sexual-assault-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/57bnm\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2803648\"            data-video-name=\"Michelle Obama's powerful rebuke to Trump's 'predatory behavior' \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"Reuters\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-57ffcde9e4b01601238957c0\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/10/13/161013michelle_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/10/13/161013michelle.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/10/13/161013michelle_WebM.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/oct/13/michelle-obama-speech-donald-trump-sexual-assault-video\">Michelle Obama\u2019s powerful rebuke to Trump\u2019s \u2018predatory behavior\u2019</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>\u201cI was shocked but not surprised,\u201d Clinton\u2019s running mate, Tim Kaine, told ABC. \u201cI was surprised on stage on Sunday night when he said \u2018I never did it\u2019 and wondered how many days it would be before folks came out and said he did.\u201d</p> <p>Allegations of sexual misconduct and crude treatment of women had attached themselves to Trump since launching his campaign in June. When the Fox News anchor Megyn Kelly questioned him about these in the first presidential debate in August, the New York real estate developer implied her tough questioning was the result of menstruation. Trump also later attacked Republican primary opponent Carly Fiorina for being unattractive, an accusation that was also levelled at the wife of Senator Ted Cruz via a retweet on Trump\u2019s Twitter account.</p> <p>In the spring of 2016, the Boston Globe reported on Trump\u2019s behaviour towards beauty pageant contestants and the New York Times published a detailed history of Trump\u2019s relationships with women over decades. The reporting prompted Ivanka Trump to deny the allegations in an interview with CBS. \u201cHe\u2019s not a groper,\u201d said Ivanka about her father. \u201cIt\u2019s not who he is. I\u2019ve known my father obviously my whole life and he has total respect for women.\u201d</p> <p>Trump, who has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/feb/26/trump-pledges-curb-press-freedom-libel-laws-first-amendment\">pledged to \u201copen up\u201d</a> American libel laws, has a long history of litigiousness and is known for issuing legal threats after unfavourable stories. In September, he <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/18/donald-trump-threatens-to-sue-new-york-times-over-irresponsible-intent\">used Twitter </a>to threaten a suit against the New York Times for what he called \u201cirresponsible intent\u201d and his wife Melania is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/01/melania-trump-daily-mail-lawsuit\">currently engaged i</a>n an active lawsuit against the Daily Mail. Trump also <a href=\"http://www.nationalreview.com/article/431575/donald-trump-tim-obrien-courtroom-story\">engaged in years of litigation </a>with biographer Tim O\u2019Brien in 2005, who stated Trump was nowhere near as wealthy as he claimed. The suit was eventually dismissed.</p> <p>Speaking to campaign volunteers at a field office in San Francisco, Clinton said the election was defined by \u201ctwo very different visions, views, and sets of values\u201d. </p> <p>\u201cAnd that\u2019s why the stakes are so high,\u201d she added. \u201cBecause we know we\u2019ve already learned who Donald Trump is.

Tesco shares slid 3% and Unilever shares dropped 3.4% as City investors were alarmed at pictures of empty shelves appearing on social media.</p> <p>But analysts said the public spat had worked out well for the supermarket, as tabloid newspapers widely portrayed Tesco as a people\u2019s champion on low prices. </p> <p>\u201cWhen was the last time you saw articles about Tesco as the shoppers\u2019 champion?\u201d said Dave McCarthy, a food retail analyst at HSBC.</p> <p>Bruno Monteyne, an analyst at Bernstein Research, said the publicity around the spat was probably helpful to both Tesco and Unilever as it would help explain probable price rises to shoppers.</p> <p>\u201cTesco recognises that Unilever\u2019s costs have gone up \u2013 there is no doubt about it \u2013 but they wanted to argue a little bit.

  "<p>Jonathan Steele\u2019s account of the situation in Aleppo (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/12/no-fly-zone-aleppo-war-russia-syria\" title=\"\">A no-fly zone for Aleppo risks a war that could engulf us all</a>, 13&#xa0;October) contains a number of dubious assertions. He claims the people of east Aleppo are being held as \u201chuman shields\u201d; but the only evidence he offers is a question: \u201cWhy, for example, have most people not left already, given the intensity of Russian bombing?\u201d If Steele wants to know the answer, why does he not talk to people living in the city \u2013 not difficult to do in the age of social media, or to the Aleppo municipal council (protecting the authority of that body is one of the conditions Staffan de Mistura has made for cooperating with the evacuation of armed militants).</p> <p>There are probably two main reasons why civilians remain in east Aleppo: some are deeply attached to their homes and unprepared to abandon them for a future as displaced persons; and many simply do not trust the assurances of the regime that they would be allowed to evacuate safely (a concern acknowledged by UN special envoy Steffan de Mistura with his declaration that he would personally accompany those leaving the city).

Russia is accused of war crimes in its support of the legitimate government of Syria in defence of that country\u2019s territorial integrity and sovereignty. But without the decisive intervention of Russia, at the invitation of the Syrian government, recognised as such in international law, there would be no Syria. At best, some sort of semi-feudal caliphate would be ruling over its captive population, cleansing it of all religious minorities. Or, at worst, the integrity of the Syrian state would be torn apart in a remake of Libya, with warring factions marauding the country and tearing it apart. The west has been more concerned with fuelling the fight to illegally overthrow the Assad regime, no matter the cost. <br><strong>Russell Caplan</strong><br><em>London</em></p> <p>\u2022 The reality is that the Putin-Assad coalition cannot be defeated in Syria and will destroy and take Aleppo in weeks. The debate in parliament showed that the UK has no useful contribution to offer toward solving the political and military situation. John Kerry on behalf of the US has given up and walked away. In effect, the people of Aleppo have been abandoned (aside from UN aid). In particular, the children of Aleppo have been abandoned and we witness their slaughter night after night on our TV screens.</p> <p>If we give first priority to saving the children and innocent people of Aleppo, then we should admit our powerlessness. The UK and the US should say to the Russians: let us stop this slaughter. We will give up Aleppo. We ask that you give those who want to leave Aleppo safe passage, as has been done elsewhere. What happens next we cannot say. But at least we will have saved the children. I suggest that is the best we can hope for.<br><strong>John Hall</strong><br><em>Landulph, Cornwall</em></p> <p>\u2022 Like countless others I am appalled at events in Syria. I am also aware of the complexity of the situation and the difficulties facing mediators. Even so, governments have failed the people of Syria from the start. It is time for a radically different approach to resolving this conflict, by bringing pressure on all governments to genuinely seek an end to the war, regardless of their vested interests.</p> <p>Perhaps only grassroots pressure by large numbers of ordinary people will convince governments that the war must be ended. That seems unlikely without some catalyst. My thoughts turn to the impact that Band Aid had in the 1980s. Ordinary people can organise petitions and write letters, but it takes global celebrities to really get people going. Is it not time for such a campaign? The men, women and children of&#xa0;Syria are surely a just cause.<br><strong>Michael Cooley</strong><br><em>Abbots Langley, Hertfordshire</em></p> <p>\u2022 You report Boris Johnson \u201ccalling for demonstrations by anti-war protesters outside the Russian embassy in London\u201d. We have reached a state in international affairs when Her Majesty\u2019s secretary of state for foreign and commonwealth affairs can stand in parliament and declare to its members and the world that mobs should surround a diplomatic mission in central London whose members are officially accredited to the United Kingdom. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vienna_Convention_on_Diplomatic_Relations\" title=\"\">Article 22 of the Vienna convention</a> says: \u201cThe premises of [a diplomatic] mission shall be inviolable \u2026 The receiving state is under a special duty to take all appropriate steps to protect the premises of the mission against any intrusion or damage and to prevent any disturbance of the peace of the mission or impairment of its dignity.\u201d <br><strong>Brian Cloughley</strong><br><em>Voutenay sur Cure, France</em></p> <p>\u2022 Boris Johnson is right to condemn the actions of Russian forces in Syria. He is completely wrong, however, to suggest that \u201canti-war protest groups\u201d are not campaigning against Vladimir Putin\u2019s aggression. The <a href=\"http://www.ppu.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Peace Pledge Union</a>, along with several other peace groups, has for years opposed all warfare and militarism, whether generated by governments in Britain, Russia or anywhere else. We support the thousands of Russian peace activists resisting Putin\u2019s militarism and we liaise with peace groups around the world through networks such as <a href=\"http://www.wri-irg.org/en/network/about_wri\" title=\"\">War Resisters\u2019 International</a>. Many of our members have protested outside embassies far more often than Boris Johnson is likely to do.</p> <p>While calling for protests against Russia, the foreign secretary is happy for the UK government to sell weapons to Saudi Arabia, whose forces are committing atrocities against the civilian population of Yemen. UK forces are themselves complicit in the killing of civilians in Iraq and Afghanistan. It is not peace campaigners who are inconsistent, but politicians such as Johnson who condemn the atrocities carried out by their enemies, but excuse those committed by their friends. <br><strong>Symon Hill</strong><br><em>Co-ordinator, Peace Pledge Union</em></p> <p>\u2022 This may be a small suggestion, but governments around the world must tell their football associations to declare now that they will not be going to Russia for the 2018 World Cup and Fifa should look at staging it elsewhere. <br><strong>Jim Cosgrove</strong> <br><em>Glasgow</em></p> <p>\u2022 Britain could exercise some leverage over Russia if it banned Russian nationals from owning British football teams, property and newspapers.<br><strong>Terry Ward</strong> <br><em>Wickford, Essex</em></p> <p>\u2022 I am extremely grateful to Boris Johnson for endorsing the principle of direct action by encouraging demonstrations in reaction to the death and destruction caused by foreign military involvement in the Middle East. If only previous foreign secretaries had been so supportive when thousands marched in protest at the Iraq and Afghanistan interventions, and more recently the Israeli bombing of Gaza. If anyone feels inclined to take to the streets of London to show their disapproval of the current Russian action in Syria, they might consider making a day of it by also visiting the Saudi Arabian embassy to express their displeasure at the civilian deaths in Yemen and, if possible, our own Ministry of Defence, which provides the enabling technical support and expertise, and facilitates the arms supplies which keep the conflict going. Next stop on the route might be 10 Downing Street, in protest at the government\u2019s reluctance to co-operate in any attempt to investigate alleged war crimes by any states with whom we share a \u201cspecial\u201d relationship.<br><strong>Karen Barratt</strong><br><em>Winchester </em></p> <p>\u2022 Your report refers to the Labour party\u2019s, briefing paper which alluded to the possibility \u201cthat Russians had committed war crimes but only if the targeting of civilians was deliberate\u201d. This interpretation of international law is far too restrictive, intentional or otherwise. If we examine the relevant article in the Rome statute, article 30, the word \u201cdeliberate\u201d is not actually used, only the key phrase \u201cintent and knowledge\u201d.</p> <p>Hence, article 30 at the International Criminal Court states that \u201cFor the purposes of this article, a person has intent where: (a) In relation to conduct, that person means to engage in the conduct; (b) In relation to a consequence, that person means to cause that consequence or is aware that it will occur in the ordinary course of events\u201d.</p> <p>And furthermore, to be absolutely sure of the meaning of the phraseology, article 30 emphasises that \u201cknowledge\u201d means awareness that a circumstance exists or a consequence will occur in the ordinary course of events. \u201cKnow\u201d and \u201cknowingly\u201d shall be construed accordingly.</p> <p>Though, of course, each bombing outrage needs to be examined with due diligence, arguably, given the chaotic situation on the ground in Syria and particularly Aleppo, any bombing campaign would clearly fall within the remit of article 30 (b) as defined at the ICC. Boris Johnson tells us that the \u201cmills of justice grind slowly but they grind small\u201d.

Murdoch said the meeting was not the forum to talk about \u201chypothetical scenarios\u201d but added that Sky had \u201crobust processes and procedures in place to deal with any related party transactions\u201d.</p> <p>Sky decided against informing or consulting shareholders about the appointment of Murdoch, although there is no legal corporate governance requirement to do so.

  "<p>\u2018Black film properties may be to the 90s what the carphone was to the 80s; every studio executive has to have one,\u201d wrote the New York Times magazine in the summer of 1991. It\u2019s a comment that speaks volumes about both a cultural moment and its transience. The piece was titled They\u2019ve Gotta Have Us, referring to Spike Lee\u2019s 1986 breakthrough movie She\u2019s Gotta Have It. The group portrait on the cover brought together an impressive collection of young, black film-makers \u2013 what has been labelled \u201cthe class of 91\u201d. Lee was head boy, of course. By that time he was well into a creative blaze that would continue at the rate of practically a film a year: Do the Right Thing (1989), Mo\u2019 Better Blues (1990), Jungle Fever (1991), Malcolm X (1992), Crooklyn (1994), Clockers (1995).</p> <p>There was also Lee\u2019s friend Ernest Dickerson, the cinematographer who made Do the Right Thing sizzle, and who was now directing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2011/jun/13/hip-hop-cinema-dickerson-juice\">his own Harlem hood tale, Juice</a>. There was Mario Van Peebles, maker of first-rate gangster thriller New Jack City. There were the Hudlin brothers, Warrington and Reginald, makers of hit teen comedy House Party. There were Charles Lane and 20-year-old Matty Rich, whose debut movies had won prizes at Cannes and Sundance, respectively.</p> <p>And the breakout star of the moment was John Singleton, whose <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/jun/13/john-singleton-filmmaker-boyz-n-the-hood-special-screening-academy\">autobiographical Los Angeles drama Boyz N the Hood</a> had earned him a three-year studio deal, and would make him the first African-American, and the youngest-ever best director Oscar nominee. \u201cThe current crop is breaking new ground in their subject matter and their politics,\u201d the article observed. \u201cFor the studios, these are tales from a new world, presented with an often harrowing, if occasionally hyperbolic, realism.\u201d The film-makers themselves seemed sensibly cautious of being lumped into a moment. \u201cIf one black film-maker messes up,\u201d said Lee, \u201cthe rest of us will be made to feel it.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/jun/13/john-singleton-filmmaker-boyz-n-the-hood-special-screening-academy\">John Singleton reflects on Boyz N the Hood: 'I didn't know anything'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The caution was justified. Fast forward 25 years or so, and we\u2019re faced with a situation where, for the second year running, not a single actor of colour received an Oscar nomination; where African-Americans are still complaining of under-representation within film and television \u2013 when they\u2019re not taking to the streets to remind the country that their lives matter. Did someone mess up?</p> <p>One thing is for sure: looking back, the 90s was a golden age. The amount of black cinema breaking through at that time is astonishing. Hip-hop, and white audiences\u2019 interest in it, fed into the movement. Rappers and musicians seamlessly transitioned into film: Ice Cube, Ice-T, Tupac Shakur, Queen Latifah. It wasn\u2019t just youthful \u201chood dramas\u201d, however; there was quality work across the spectrum. Serious thrillers such as Devil in a Blue Dress and Deep Cover, appeared alongside arthouse-friendly fare from the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L.A._Rebellion\">\u201cLA Rebellion\u201d group</a>. This film-schooled movement generated influential works such as Charles Burnett\u2019s To Sleep With Anger and Julie Dash\u2019s Daughters of the Dust, released in 1991, the first feature directed by an African-American woman to get theatrical distribution across the US.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1269fb1c77f71aba83c69c78efe180431b766e22\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1269fb1c77f71aba83c69c78efe180431b766e22/0_0_2742_1813/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ice Cube in Boyz N the Hood.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"661\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ice Cube in Boyz N the Hood.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Columbia/Sportsphoto/Allstar</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>On television, too, African-American content seemed to be crossing over. Will Smith figuratively <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2016/mar/17/the-fresh-prince-of-bel-air-when-the-mainstream-met-afrocentric-style\">sauntered into Hollywood in The Fresh Prince of Bel Air</a>, while Jamie Foxx cut his teeth on the Wayans brothers\u2019 sketch show, In Living Color. If you bothered to flick over from Friends or Seinfeld, you could find black-led series such as Moesha, A Different World, Family Matters, Kenan and Kel, Martin (as in Lawrence), Queen Latifah\u2019s Living Single, Sister Sister and Malcolm &amp; Eddie.</p> <p>For the first time, mainstream cinema and TV audiences were getting honest, intelligent portrayals of both modern African-American life and US history from a black perspective \u2013 the type of stories only black film-makers could tell. The revolution was being televised, dramatised, publicised and eulogised.</p> <p>It is worth remembering that it was only three years earlier, in 1987, that Robert Townsend had made the cult satire <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hollywood_Shuffle\">Hollywood Shuffle</a>, which detailed the futile struggle of an aspiring black actor, and feels as if it is from a completely different era. \u201cThe only role they gonna let us do is a slave, a butler or some street hood,\u201d a fellow auditionee tells Townsend\u2019s character. White producers say they\u2019re looking for an \u201cEddie Murphy type\u201d, and ask him to \u201cbe more black\u201d. In his daydreams, Townsend fantasises about playing a film-noir sleuth, a Shakespearean king, a superhero, even a black Rambo. Instead, he wins the role of a stereotypical, jive-talking street hood, which only conjures visions of protesters picketing his house, accusing him of selling out. As an NAACP spokesman puts it: \u201cThey\u2019ll never play the Rambos until they stop playing the sambos.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"eb002bc31e483da3c3d07c76ab3dbec175ecbae6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/eb002bc31e483da3c3d07c76ab3dbec175ecbae6/0_0_4000_2727/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jimmy Woodward and Robert Townsend in Hollywood Shuffle.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"682\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jimmy Woodward and Robert Townsend in Hollywood Shuffle.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But by the mid-90s, Townsend\u2019s wildest dreams had become reality. Now, you could be a black Shakespearean (Denzel Washington in <a href=\"https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1045992-much_ado_about_nothing/\">Much Ado About Nothing</a>), or a black superhero (Wesley Snipes in Blade), or, if not quite Rambo, at least a black action hero (Will Smith in Bad Boys).</p> <p>The fruit of that 90s creative flowering was a generation of African-American performers who gained real Hollywood power: the power to take leading roles, to win awards and, ultimately, to get movies greenlit. Most of them were men, which tells its own story, and most of them still wield that power today: Washington, Smith, Foxx, Samuel L Jackson. But it was also the era when Angela Bassett became the first black women in more than a decade to get a best actress Oscar nomination (for the Tina Turner biopic What\u2019s Love Got to Do With It?) and Whitney Houston powered hits such as The Bodyguard and (alongside Bassett) Waiting to Exhale.</p> <p>But did that success come at a cost? The actors were getting the roles, but their movies weren\u2019t necessarily \u201cblack\u201d stories. More often than not, they became token black faces in otherwise business-as-usual Hollywood movies \u2013 exceptions that proved the rule, you could say. One moment Will Smith might be Muhammad Ali, for example, but the next he would be \u201cmagical negro\u201d <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2001/feb/23/culture.peterbradshaw\">golf caddy Bagger Vance</a>. Meanwhile, the film-makers that had helped put them there seemed to get left behind.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"aaaebe1b69df0583e55d670a47834bcc61b3abbf\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/aaaebe1b69df0583e55d670a47834bcc61b3abbf/0_0_2464_1677/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tracy Camilla Johns and Spike Lee in She\u2019s Gotta Have It.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"681\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tracy Camilla Johns and Spike Lee in She\u2019s Gotta Have It.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Island/Everett/REX/Shutterstock/Island/Everett/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It\u2019s easy to forget just what a struggle they had had. Townsend had to max out credit cards and scavenge leftover film stock to cobble together Hollywood Shuffle. It took Lee four years to raise $175,000 to make She\u2019s Gotta Have It, in a brisk 12 days. Lee even encouraged his crew to save their drinks cans so he could cash them in for recycling. One upshot of these shoestring budgets was that these films became hugely profitable when they broke through. It was arguably that profitability, rather than any cultural mission, that caught Hollywood\u2019s attention.</p> <p>A big part of the problem, says Julie Dash, was that black cinema\u2019s ascent coincided with Hollywood\u2019s takeover of independent cinema as a whole. \u201cIt became a commodity that could be co-opted by the larger industry. We broke through, and once the curators of culture recognised that we were actively making films in our own way, it suddenly just slowed down to a halt. Funding ran out for pretty much everyone.\u201d</p> <p>Dash\u2019s Daughters of the Dust was one of the unsung highlights of this era. It deals with Dash\u2019s own <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gullah\">Gullah community</a>, descended from slaves who settled on the coast of North Carolina, but it does so with a unique sensibility, weaving together three generations of female characters with music, dance, folk storytelling and lyrical imagery. She describes it as \u201chistory reframed, reimagined, redefined\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b65708eab90e24176444c5cc4501ed965d366d8c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b65708eab90e24176444c5cc4501ed965d366d8c/0_0_1920_1080/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Daughters of the Dust.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"563\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Daughters of the Dust.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: null/BFI</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The movie won widespread acclaim on its release, and played in one movie theatre for 36 weeks, but Dash never made another feature film. \u201cI\u2019d written many, many additional screenplays and pitched ideas and optioned screenplays \u2013 all of those wonderful things that one does after making a film that clearly had a wide audience. It didn\u2019t happen for me,\u201d she says. \u201cThere\u2019s no reason given, but of course it\u2019s race and gender. Gender plays a huge part in all of this. I did not fit into the mould.\u201d</p> <p>As the New Yorker pointed out last year, Richard Linklater, who also released his debut, Slacker, in 1991, has gone on to make 15 features to date. \u201cSome of them are excellent,\u201d <a href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/culture/richard-brody/movie-week-daughters-dust\">wrote Richard Brody</a>, \u201cbut neither Slacker nor any of the others can hold a candle to the inventiveness of Daughters of the Dust.\u201d</p> <p>Many other black film-makers fell by the wayside after that initial burst. Wendell Harris\u2019s Sundance-winning Chameleon Street didn\u2019t get a cinema release. Matty Rich made one more movie after Straight Outta Brooklyn, then went into video games. Even those who did graduate into the mainstream found their work compromised. Charles Burnett, for example, followed up To Sleep With Anger with <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Glass_Shield\">The Glass Shield</a>, a complex drama about a black cop in an institutionally racist LAPD. It was picked up by Harvey Weinstein\u2019s indie-devouring Miramax, which forced Burnett to change the ending and then attempted to market it as another Boyz N the Hood, giving prominence to Ice Cube in the promotional materials even though he was a peripheral character. It didn\u2019t find an audience, and Burnett never worked with Hollywood again.</p> <p>\u201cThat crossover into the mainstream, into an industry of big business and box office and expectations and formulas, reduced their ability to tell black-focused, \u2018authentic\u2019 stories,\u201d says <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/people/ashley-clark\">Ashley Clark</a>, writer and curator of the <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/black-star\">BFI\u2019s current Black Star celebration of black cinema in all its forms</a>, which includes many of those 90s classics. (It was a different story in the UK in the 1990s, incidentally. Or rather, a non-story. Just about the only British actor to figure in this era was, believe it or not, Lenny Henry. Disney gave him a three-picture deal in 1991, evidently attempting to position him as a new Eddie Murphy. They paired him with Charles Lane for True Identity, in which Henry played several roles including a white gangster. Its failure nipped both Henry\u2019s and Lane\u2019s Hollywood careers in the bud.)</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cce5da6af3d15eb674194c70a450fcb4540db736\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cce5da6af3d15eb674194c70a450fcb4540db736/0_0_2000_1355/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Delroy Lindo and Denzel Washington in Malcolm X.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"678\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Delroy Lindo and Denzel Washington in Malcolm X.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/Warner Bros</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Directors such as Singleton, Dickerson and Van Peebles also struggled to recapture the energy once they became Hollywood properties. Lee\u2019s career assumed the form of a continual battle. Clark points out that he had a terrible time making Malcolm X, for example. \u201cHe had to fight off competition from other studios to do it. Norman Jewison wanted to do it. His studio, Warner Bros, wouldn\u2019t expand the budget, so he had to do a crowdfunding campaign and get people like Prince, Michael Jackson and Oprah Winfrey to fund it.\u201d By the end of the decade, Lee\u2019s crossover audience had waned, even if the quality of his output hadn\u2019t. Films such as Crooklyn and Bamboozled flopped at the box office, and he wound up making journeyman genre fare such as 25th Hour.</p> <p>But what other options did Lee and co have? \u201cWhat people don\u2019t realise is, he gets tarred and feathered as this angry, political black man, but he\u2019s an artist, and he\u2019s constantly working,\u201d says Clark. \u201cHe works in documentary, he works in commercials, he never stops. And he has to do that. He can\u2019t, like other directors, just go away for eight years and come back and do something when he feels like it.\u201d</p> <p>By the new millennium, we had collectively fooled ourselves that we no longer needed a black cinema anyway. Washington and Halle Berry had won their Oscars, and nobody seemed to be that bothered that the new face of black cinema was <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madea\">Tyler Perry dressed as a granny</a>. Actually, a lot of people were bothered by Perry \u2013 Lee dismissed him as \u201ccoonery buffoonery\u201d \u2013 but the assumption, particularly outside the African-American community, was that the battles had all been won. The notion was continually reinforced by self-congratulatory <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_savior_narrative_in_film\">white-saviour race movies</a> such as The Help, Freedom Writers, The Soloist and The Blind Side (it\u2019s still going on \u2013 see Matthew McConaughey\u2019s latest, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/jun/23/free-state-jones-review-matthew-mcconaughey-newton-knight\">The Free State of Jones</a>), or music biopics such as Ray, Dreamgirls and Get On Up, whose content was safely sealed off from the present-day black experience.

The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/feb/25/oscarssowhite-10-point-plan-hashtag-academy-awards-april-reign\">#OscarSoWhite debacle</a> highlighted ongoing discrimination and lack of opportunity within the industry. Outside of cinema, society is beginning to notice how little has changed. Boyz N the Hood began with an epigraph stating: \u201cOne out of every 21 black American males will be murdered in their lifetime.\u201d The figure is lower today, but black Americans are still eight times as likely as white ones to be homicide victims. Lee\u2019s Malcolm X began with a videotape of the brutal police beating of Rodney King, which sparked off the 1992 Los Angeles riots. In recent years, we\u2019ve seen a similar succession of police killings of unarmed African-Americans, captured on mobile phones, which have also sparked riots and civil unrest.</p> <p>A new generation of black film-makers is starting to respond to this reality, down the road those 90s pioneers paved. Witness Ryan Coogler, whose <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/jun/05/fruitvale-station-review-oscar-grant\">2013 Sundance-winner, Fruitvale Station</a>, sensitively dramatised the police shooting of Oscar Grant, an unarmed Oakland commuter. To his credit, Sylvester Stallone recruited Coogler to write and direct <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/jan/14/creed-review-rocky-sequel-boxing-sylvester-stallone\">his latter-day Rocky vehicle Creed</a>, and allowed him to turn what could have been a creaky franchise instalment into a vibrant, nuanced portrait of an unstereotypical African-American (Michael B Jordan) in demographically altered modern-day Philadelphia. Coogler\u2019s next project is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2014/oct/29/marvel-black-panther-black-superhero-chadwick-boseman\">Marvel\u2019s Black Panther superhero movie</a>.</p> <p>Slavery has been put back on the agenda by 12 Years a Slave and Django Unchained, and it\u2019s being kept there by the Roots remake and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2016/oct/10/the-birth-of-a-nation-problems-nate-parker\">Nate Parker\u2019s Birth of a Nation</a> (the toast of this year\u2019s Sundance, until its maker\u2019s name was tarnished by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/sep/30/nate-parker-birth-of-a-nation-rape-allegation-60-minutes-interview\">past rape allegations</a>). Justin Simien\u2019s Dear White People <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/jun/25/justin-simien-im-black-im-a-man-im-gay-but-im-more-than-all-of-those-things\">smartly dissected modern campus politics</a>. Big things are anticipated for Barry Jenkins, whose artful gay black drama Moonlight comes out in the US this month. There\u2019s also (at last) an appreciable British black-cinema contingent feeding into this, both of directors (Steve McQueen, Amma Asante, Noel Clarke) and actors (David Oyelowo, Idris Elba, Gugu Mbatha-Raw, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Naomie Harris). Television is in good shape now, too, what with Donald Glover\u2019s Atlanta, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/oct/12/insecure-review-issa-rae\">Issa Rae\u2019s Insecure</a>, Marvel\u2019s Luke Cage, Empire, Black-ish.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3844fd6bf591a9442cbf8b8c22a2dc3ba27b91f6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3844fd6bf591a9442cbf8b8c22a2dc3ba27b91f6/61_0_2834_1701/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Straight Outta Compton.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Straight Outta Compton.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jaimie Trueblood/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>And a force all of her own is Ava DuVernay, whose <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/selma\">Selma</a> arguably made more of an impact for not getting enough Oscar respect than it would have done if it had. DuVernay has since turned out the powerful Netflix documentary 13th (on the incarceration of black men), the TV miniseries Queen Sugar, and her next project, Disney sci-fi A Wrinkle in Time, makes her the first black woman to command a $100m (\u00a381m) budget.</p> <p>We should be cautious before heralding a class of 2016, however, both in light of what happened last time round, but also because black cinema is a construct, just as \u201cblackness\u201d itself is a construct. The label can be limiting, says Clark. \u201cWhen a black film-maker makes films about black people, it\u2019s \u2018black cinema\u2019 rather than just cinema. You find yourself in that kind of bind, where today something like Moonlight \u2013 yes, it\u2019s being talked about in terms of black masculinity and it\u2019s very culturally specific, but at the end of the day, it\u2019s wonderful cinema. I think there\u2019s a misunderstanding that black cinema is in and of itself a genre, when in fact it isn\u2019t.\u201d</p> <p>The 90s golden age has become a cultural touchstone for the current generation. Ice Cube, for example, who has never been out of work since Boyz N the Hood, found his own life dramatised in last year\u2019s hit NWA biopic Straight Outta Compton. Cube\u2019s Boyz co-star Cuba Gooding Jr, meanwhile, just headed up another 90s-based nostalgia trip: The People Vs OJ Simpson, which won nine Emmys this year.

And even Spike Lee seems to have got his mojo back. His latest, Chi-Raq, a confrontational take on south Chicago gun violence, has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/nov/25/chi-raq-review-spike-lees-urgent-angry-and-very-sexy-midlife-masterpiece\">brought him his best reviews in decades</a>, as well as reuniting him with original troupe members such as Angela Bassett, Wesley Snipes and Samuel L Jackson.

The film was also heavily appropriated by Beyonc\u00e9 in her lavish \u201cvisual album\u201d for Lemonade \u2013 which could turn out to be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/apr/25/beyonce-lemonade-jay-z-infidelity-emotional-project-depths\">one of the most significant pieces of black cinema of our time</a>. It\u2019s apt that a performer such as Beyonc\u00e9, in her newly politicised incarnation, would turn to a movie so concerned with cultural memory and reconnection to African-American history. That history has been reframed, redefined and reimagined once again. Dash herself is delighted. In addition, in the wake of the #OscarSoWhite debacle, Dash was one of the film-makers invited to join the new, more-inclusive Academy.

The award is shared with a writer who has been persecuted for speaking out about their beliefs, selected by the winner in consultation with <a href=\"https://www.englishpen.org/\">English Pen</a>\u2019s Writers at Risk committee. Tutul is a publisher, writer and editor who founded Shuddhashar magazine and publishing house in Dhaka, where he promoted progressive work from Bangladeshi writers and bloggers.</p> <p>According to Pen, at least nine writers, intellectuals and activists have been murdered in Bangladesh by Islamic extremists since the start of 2015. Many of the victims worked with Shuddhashar, including the author and blogger <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/mar/02/avijit-roy-hacked-to-death-bangladesh-dhaka-religion-free-speech\">Avijit Roy</a>, who was murdered in the street in February 2015. Tutul received a death threat the same day, for publishing atheist writers; in October last year, he was attacked by assailants with machetes and guns, and hospitalised in a critical condition. He and his family were forced into exile, eventually settling in Norway in February.</p> <p>Atwood said it was an honour to share the prize with the Bangladeshi publisher. \u201cNot only has he shown huge personal courage in the face of adversity, he has also risked everything to give a voice to many other Bangladeshis who are under threat of being silenced, whether through violence or ambivalence,\u201d she said. \u201cAt a time when so many of our colleagues in Bangladesh are risking their lives simply by putting pen to paper, it seems very fitting to share this award with Tutul, and to highlight the plight that he and his colleagues continue to face.\u201d</p> <p>Tutul told the Guardian that he hoped winning the prize would \u201cgive me some inspiration and some power in the future, for my writing and my publication\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThe current situation is that it is not possible to continue my work in Bangladesh. But I am dreaming and thinking about how I can continue my job and my work in an alternative way. I\u2019m thinking I will convert my books to ebooks, and continue my publication by epublication, because the situation in Bangladesh is that it is not easy to publish any free-thinking books,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cI miss my country. I have done all of my work there and it\u2019s difficult to establish working in another country for me. I am always dreaming that the day will come when I go back to my country.\u201d</p> <p>And he reiterated his call for his critics to answer him with words instead of violence. \u201cIf [the Islamic fundamentalists] have any logical ground, they can reply logically, by writing. I always think that text and books and writing can be the change in our social structure, in our mentality.\u201d</p> <p>The Pen Pinter prize, for an author who, in the Nobel laureate\u2019s words, shows a \u201cfierce intellectual determination ... to define the real truth of our lives and our societies\u201d, has been running since 2009, and awarded to writers including Salman Rushdie and Carol Ann Duffy.

[But] even in titular democracies, such events are becoming, unfortunately, much more frequent.

  "<p>Nigerian defence officials say they believe more schoolgirls abducted by Boko Haram will be released in the coming weeks, raising the prospect of a swift end to one of the most high-profile kidnappings perpetrated by a terrorist group in recent years.</p> <p>Twenty-one of the 276 schoolgirls <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/may/15/chibok-nigeria-200-kidnapped-schoolgirls-boko-haram\">taken from their hostel in a government boarding school in the town of Chibok</a> by the Islamic militant group in April 2014, were freed early on Thursday morning in a deal brokered by international mediators.</p> <p>The kidnapping of the girls led to the global campaign <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/voluntary-sector-network/2014/may/09/bringbackourgirls-power-of-social-media\">#BringBackOurGirls</a>, with public figures including the US first lady, Michelle Obama, taking part.</p> <p>Few details have emerged of the ordeal of the abducted girls, many of whom are believed to have been taken as wives by extremists and systematically raped. Others have reportedly been forced to carry out demanding physical tasks.</p> <p>About 190 girls from Chibok are still held by the militants. Fifty-seven fled within hours of being captured, and in May this year, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/19/nigerian-president-meet-chibok-schoolgirl-escaped-boko-haram\">one girl was found and rescued</a> in an area close to Boko Haram strongholds.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re not authorised to release the details of how the girls were retrieved yet, but the operation to retrieve the girls is ongoing. We are optimistic we will retrieve more of the Chibok girls from Boko Haram very soon, in the coming weeks,\u201d Gen Rabe Abubakar, a defence ministry spokesman, said.</p> <p>The freed girls were being transported from the north-east of the country, where Boko Haram has its remaining strongholds, to Abuja, the capital, on Thursday afternoon. A team of social workers, doctors and counsellors were awaiting their arrival. Many were reported to have babies with them, born in captivity. </p> <p>Earlier in the day, a spokesman for Muhammadu Buhari, the Nigerian president, confirmed that 21 of the missing girls were in the custody of the department of state services.</p> <p>\u201cThe release of the girls, in a limited number, is the outcome of negotiations between the administration and Boko Haram brokered by the International Red Cross and the Swiss government. The negotiations will continue,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cThe president welcomes the release of the girls but cautioned Nigerians to be mindful of the fact that more than 30,000 fellow citizens were killed via terrorism.\u201d</p> <p>The information minister, Lai Mohammed, denied reports that four Boko Haram prisoners were exchanged for the girls. \u201cThis is not a swap, but a release,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.thecable.ng/breaking-fg-not-swap-boko-haram-prisoners-chibok-girls\">Mohammed said</a>.</p> <p>The release will be a boost to Buhari, who vowed to crush Boko Haram within a year when he <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/mar/31/opposition-candidate-muhammadu-buhari-wins-nigerian-election\">took power in May 2015</a>. While government forces have taken back large amounts of territory from the group, it has remained active, killing hundreds of people in suicide bombings.</p> <p>The #BringBackOurGirls campaign group said Thursday\u2019s release was a \u201cwonderful development\u201d that confirmed \u201cwhat we have always known about the capacity of our government to rescue our #ChibokGirls\u201d.</p> <p>Prof Emma Shehu, a leader of the group, said she was relieved by the news.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ve been castigated by the past government, by the military and by the hardliners in the current administration for continuing with our advocacy and protests for the kidnapped girls. They\u2019ve treated us as though we were mad but we\u2019re happy that this is partly a vindication of our insanity. For the parents it\u2019s raised their hopes,\u201d Shehu said.</p> <p>The Chibok girls are among thousands of adults and children who have been abducted by Boko Haram during its seven-year insurgency. The group is short of manpower and has turned to abductions as recruitment has slowed.</p> <p>Negotiations with Nigerian government representatives for the release of the schoolgirls have been complicated by splits within Boko Haram. The movement has fractured into two, possibly three factions <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2016/oct/06/isis-al-qaida-turf-wars-africa-may-push-fragile-states-to-breaking-point\">over the issue of links with Islamic State</a>.</p> <p>Isis, of which the Nigerian group is still theoretically an affiliate, announced last month that Abu Musab al-Barnawi was the new leader of Boko Haram, replacing the erratic Abubakar Shekau. The decision may have been prompted by Shekau\u2019s use of female suicide bombers and targeting of Muslims.</p> <p>Shekau has continued to claim to be in control of the group. A video released of the Chibok girls in August seemed to have come from his camp somewhere in the sprawling Sambisa forest, in Borno. It showed about 50 of the girls and included a demand for the release of imprisoned militants in exchange for them.</p> <p>A suicide bomber in Maiduguri, the capital of Borno State and birthplace of Boko Haram, <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-nigeria-security-idUSKCN12C0XM\">killed eight people on Wednesday</a>.</p> <p>British and US special forces have been assisting the Nigerian military in their campaign against Boko Haram. Support by soldiers from the neighbouring countries of Niger, Cameroon and Chad \u2013 was critical in pushing back the extremists, experts said.</p> <p>The previous Nigerian government, under Goodluck Jonathan, conducted high-level negotiations before realising it was talking to impostors.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/mar/28/muhammadu-buhari-nigeria-problems-boko-haram-corruption\">Muhammadu Buhari talked tough on Nigeria\u2019s problems.

They can only bomb locations now because they hold no territory and we are defeating them at each stage. The government is negotiating with Boko Haram, including prisoner swaps, but at the same time we the military are degrading them where we can. That is proving an effective way of defeating this group.\u201d</p> <p>Elizabeth Donnelly, an expert at London\u2019s Chatham House, said the release suggested \u201ca potential opening with the insurgents\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThere is still a question of why only this number [of girls has been released] but it shows that negotiations are possible and that is really important in trying to shift the nature of the conflict,\u201d Donnelly said.</p> <p>In the past year, the Nigerian army has retaken towns and villages in the north-east controlled by Boko Haram, and has freed hundreds of women and children held captive. However, many survivors face rejection or are stigmatised when they return to their families or are settled in refugee camps.</p> <p>In many areas of northern Nigeria, millions of victims of malnutrition, neglect and in some cases famine are surfacing, threatening a vast humanitarian crisis. Aid workers say hundreds of thousands of children are chronically malnourished.</p>",

That all changed with Like a Rolling Stone in 1965, when he said he did not need to divide his talents \u2013 a song could contain as many ideas as a novel or a poem. And then he proved it possible, over and over again, for decades now, never predictable, always on fire, the most cunning wordsmith and the most cunning magpie. As far as I\u2019m concerned, he has no equal. From tender love songs like Make You Feel My Love, that resonate even with the Snapchat/Instagram generation, to the prophetic A Hard Rain\u2019s a-Gonna Fall and everything in between, I\u2019m in awe.

The memoirs are not inconsiderable literary works. I have a vexed relationship with popular music \u2013 so much so that I barely listen at all for years at a time; but my relation with Dylan\u2019s art has been consistently intense and rewarding. No, my only caveat about the award is that it cheapens Dylan to be associated at all with a prize founded on an explosives and armaments fortune, and more often awarded to a Buggins whose turn it is than a world-class creative artist. Really, it\u2019s a bit like when Sartre was awarded the Nobel \u2013 he was primarily a philosopher, and had the nous to refuse it.

I was a Saturday boy in a record shop at the time, and in my lunch hour I would sit in the listening booth with a sticky bun listening to music \u2013 I was into singer-songwriter stuff like Simon &amp; Garfunkel. One day, the guy who ran the shop decided to spin me Bob Dylan\u2019s Greatest Hits \u2013 the original one, with the book on the cover. Mr Tambourine Man blew my mind. Whenever anyone asks me to give an example of poetry \u2013 not poetry in music, but poetry, period \u2013 I always go back to that.

And so, the award to Bob Dylan is a great boon to lovers of fair-minded compassion, fellowship, and common decency, which step forward at the perfect moment to do battle with the egotistical, bigoted, greedy, misogynistic spitefulness of Trump\u2019s America.

Dylan\u2019s \u201clyrics\u201d to his songs for decades now, by poets especially, have been considered as great poetry. It\u2019s not only poetry: it\u2019s poetry that reminds us that poetry is not only what\u2019s published in the poetry books. Same as in cinema: some of the most inspiring cinema is outside of the industrial cinema.</p> <h2>Elijah Wald, author of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/jul/10/dylan-goes-electric-elijah-wald-review-when-bob-took-stratocaster-newport-folk-festival\">Dylan Goes Electric!</a></h2> <p>I\u2019ve always had mixed feelings about the people who call Dylan a poet, or call his songs literature, because songs tend to reach far more people, and often touch them more deeply, than poetry or novels. Dylan transformed the role of lyrics in popular music, and it is hard to argue that any writer of the last 50 years, in any form, has been more influential. But millions of people, all around the world, have loved Dylan\u2019s recordings without understanding the words. So I think the honour is deserved, but I hope he brings his band to Stockholm.<br></p>",
  "<p>Sasha Lane was 19, on spring break from Texas State University and partying in Florida when she was spotted by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/andrea-arnold\">Andrea Arnold</a>. The director, then 53, had just lost her lead actor for a film that was due to start shooting within weeks. Among the tens of thousands of students getting trashed and showing off on Panama City beach, the dreadlocked and tattooed Lane stood out.

It was her first experience of acting and Lane was thrown into a 54-day shoot, spent on the road, travelling 1,200 miles from Oklahoma to North Dakota. \u201cMy gosh, it took a lot of reevaluating things, time and conversation and being really exhausted, to find a boundary [between Star and Sasha].\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"28d85e44583e8f58dc08db5f309901b5964df07f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/28d85e44583e8f58dc08db5f309901b5964df07f/0_0_2000_1500/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018I see a lot of myself in Star\u2019 \u2026 Lane in American Honey.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018I see a lot of myself in Star\u2019 \u2026 Lane in American Honey.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/FILM4</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Almost a dozen characters, the vast majority of them street-cast following the Arnold method, make up the travelling \u201cmag crew\u201d Star joins to hustle and sell print subscriptions door-to-door.

And so there\u2019s a juddering incongruity when I meet Lane: now 21, the confident, magnetic force of nature I had expected is shrinkwrapped. Swathed in regulatory goth black, her braids looped into two topknots, she is dialled down to a timid-but-sweet awkwardness.</p> <p>\u201cI come from a place where I didn\u2019t have a lot of opportunities. A lot of people would say: \u2018You can\u2019t do this or you can\u2019t do that.\u2019 So meeting Andrea \u2026 I literally said: \u2018I have nothing left to lose, I have to put my trust in you. She made me feel like I could.\u201d The sense of hope, she says, is the biggest change in her life since it changed for ever. \u201cThere are opportunities and it feels like I can do things now. I just wanted a chance.\u201d</p> <p>Lane has no plans to finish her degree. \u201cI\u2019m pissed that I\u2019m paying back student loans when all I know is that a lobster is a mollusc [sic]. I don\u2019t care. I learn differently, I don\u2019t want to take classes I\u2019m not interested in, I don\u2019t live like that.

Lane\u2019s parents divorced when she was young and her older brother, to whom she\u2019s now \u201csuper close\u201d, went to live with her father, while she \u201cmoved around a lot near Dallas\u201d before her mother, who is from New Zealand, settled in Frisco, a bland, prosperous, conservative, new-build city on the edge of downtown Dallas. \u201cI was not a part of it, I didn\u2019t look like everyone else, I didn\u2019t care about the things they cared about.

I read books in my closet, I didn\u2019t have a personalised room. Tattoos were probably the most open way to express what I\u2019m into and about. I waited until I was 18, and it went downhill from there.\u201d She has 17 tattoos now. \u201cThey\u2019re my posters on the wall.\u201d</p> <p>Last year, when they finished filming, tabloid reports <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-3233983/Shia-LaBeouf-moves-new-girlfriend-Sasha-Lane-following-dramatic-split-Mia-Goth.html\">claimed</a> that Lane and LaBeouf were in an off-screen relationship.

Andrea creates this moment. I just trusted her. I had no hand on the wheel at that point. I was open to anything and letting it happen.\u201d</p> <p>I mention an Instagram <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/9GyVRZpo5D/?hl=en\">she posted around that time</a>, in which she talks about surviving through pain and struggle her whole life and being clear: \u201cI did not make it to LA bc of a relationship, nor did I by conforming, I was chosen because of ME, and I worked long hard hours and months to uphold the beauty Andrea saw in me \u2026 I have been through too much for too long to let anyone diminish my character. I am not a destitute, or a Cinderella or lucky, I am fucking resilient.\u201d It\u2019s an airpunch statement, but Lane\u2019s shoulders drop and she looks painfully sad, her head low, on hearing it again.</p> <p>\u201cThat was nothing to do with \u2026 it was just a bunch of everything,\u201d she says. She makes eye-contact again. \u201cNo one expects a girl from Texas who looks like me or acts like me to achieve anything. Luck is nothing to me, everything I\u2019ve gone through, everything I\u2019ve done has been because of who I was.\u201d For all that seems to be bubbling under the surface, Lane still wants to seem accommodating. \u201cI\u2019m an anxious, uncomfortable person, but I also love pleasing people, which really sucks.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ee4c565c66c5caaf428fa722e8c48b2050141630\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ee4c565c66c5caaf428fa722e8c48b2050141630/0_82_1439_863/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Lane and Shia LaBeouf in American Honey.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lane and Shia LaBeouf in American Honey.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: handout/Handout</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Is she happy?</p> <p>She kisses her teeth and ums seven times. \u201cI feel like there\u2019s too much in my mind to ever be like: \u2018Yeah, I\u2019m happy.\u2019 Like I\u2019m scared to say it, because maybe that means I\u2019m about to get dropped in on my ass.\u201d</p> <p>We chat about the complications of sex and relationships. \u201cI want to be alone so bad,\u201d she insists. \u201cI\u2019m truly exhausted by people and all of that and I\u2019ve never had a chance to look out for myself and I really like to spend a lot of time alone.\u201d She says that the attention she gets makes her deeply uncomfortable. \u201cIt\u2019s a hard mix.

Lane and the cast spent hours on the road crossing the wide open plains of Bible-belt America, listening to trap music, getting high and blurring the reality between what was real and what was for the film. Did Trump\u2019s popularity ring true in the small towns they landed on and the motels they crashed in?</p> <p>\u201cCould be, I don\u2019t know, but people like him is why this film needs to be shared.

Say hello to \u201cI\u2019m with Nigel\u201d, as the breakout star of Brexit tries to make it big in America, accompanied by his coat-tailing posse from back home. Don\u2019t ask me the title of this shitshow, girls. Cause you <em>know</em> you just switched on Enfarage.</p> <p>First, the set-up. Nigel Farage is a leading man whose success in the referendum vote has drawn offers from That America. Specifically, from Donald Trump\u2019s campaign for the presidency, which has taken inspiration from the poll-busting Brexit result, and reportedly wants to pick his brains. Please don\u2019t conclude that the relationship is being wildly exaggerated, and that Farage is so junior that even Trump\u2019s people have people who deal with him.</p> <p>Instead, just get behind the fact that it\u2019s finally happening \u2013 Nigel Farage is GOING WEST! He is LIVING THE DREAM! If you\u2019re up to speed with the series, you\u2019ll know that Nigel has already gone to the Republican national convention in Cleveland. Nigel has been permitted to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/26/nigel-farage-brexit-hero-donald-trump\">open for Trump in Mississippi</a>. Nigel has been said to be advising Trump in advance of the final two debates. Nigel is <a href=\"http://insider.foxnews.com/2016/10/08/nigel-farage-donald-trump-not-running-pope-president-ukip-brexit-hillary-lewd-comments\">on Fox News</a>. Nigel is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/10/nigel-farage-fights-donald-trumps-corner-in-post-debate-spin-room\">in the spin room</a>. Nigel is hotly tipped to <a href=\"http://comicbook.com/2015/06/06/remembering-entourages-aquaman-movie/\">play the lead in James Cameron\u2019s Aquaman</a>. I don\u2019t know if Nigel has a mid-Atlantic accent yet, but when asked whether he would return as the permanent Ukip leader, <a href=\"http://www.standard.co.uk/news/politics/ukip-leader-diane-james-quits-after-18-days-in-charge-a3361196.html\">his reply</a> was genuinely \u201cnot for 10 million dollars\u201d. Nigel, <a href=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/7/7d/Logo_of_UKIP.svg/1024px-Logo_of_UKIP.svg.png\">your official logo</a> is a pound sign. Why are you suddenly speaking in dollars? Is this a bit like <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0609602/\">that Alan Partridge episode</a> where his mate from the petrol station gets infatuated with a cod-American trucker called Tex? Or do you just prefer to talk in currencies that aren\u2019t tanking?</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/12/nigel-farage-donald-trump-ukip-meps\">Nigel Farage criticised for defending Donald Trump by Ukip MEPs</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But wait, because Nigel also has a crew, who he wants with him for the journey because 1) he\u2019s codependent, and 2) that\u2019s the entire show, dude! Don\u2019t take it from me \u2013 take it from Ukip financier Arron Banks, whose forthcoming book on the gang is called <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Bad-Boys-Brexit-Guerrilla-Referendum/dp/1785901826\">The Bad Boys of Brexit</a>, and features a cover shot I\u2019ve already captioned \u201cTurtle, E, Vinnie, Drama\u201d. The aforementioned bad boys are Arron, communications chap Andy Wigmore and another businessmen bankroller called Richard Tice. (\u201cTice is the worst!\u201d <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Arron_banks/status/778271006146322432\">honks Arron</a>, presumably in a teaser for the episode Tice is the Worst.)</p> <p>Tice doesn\u2019t seem to be with Nigel as we speak, but the others have <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/08/25/nigel-farage-tells-donald-trump-rally-i-wouldnt-vote-for-clinton/\">caught a ride with him</a> at various stages of the US journey. And why not? Entourage was, of course, a show whose almost ineffably complex and nuanced four-way bromance was best summarised in the following exchange:</p> <p><em>E:</em> \u201cCould you get laid without Vince? That\u2019s the question?\u201d</p> <p><em>Turtle:</em> \u201cDo I give a fuck? That\u2019s the answer!\u201d</p> <p>So picture the same dynamic, only with Nigel Farage. Of course, I mean it only metaphorically as far as the bad boys of Enfarage are concerned. I\u2019m pretty sure they all have wives, estranged or otherwise and, anyway, they wouldn\u2019t have gone near the traditional RNC hookers\u2019n\u2019coke bonanza. Fine wines, yes. Blowing rails off a paid friend while telling her about the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/16/nigel-farage-defends-ukip-breaking-point-poster-queue-of-migrants\">Breaking Point poster</a>? Don\u2019t be absurd. Essentially, these are country mice. I get the feeling they\u2019re a bit \u201cunsettled\u201d by alt-right comers such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/26/my-night-out-in-cleveland-with-the-worst-men-on-the-internet\">Milo Yiannopolous </a>.</p> <p>Of course, there are some characters too silly even to make the Enfarage cut. There is Breitbart London editor Raheem Kassam, for instance, who is running for the Ukip leadership under the Trump-frotting slogan Make Britain Great Again. Raheem once poignantly bought <a href=\"http://www.thecommentator.com/system/articles/inner_pictures/000/005/856/thumb/Capture_1_pgsh4p.png?1431874200\">the same coat as Nigel</a>, but his puritan dullardry is preventing him getting even a three-episode arc. \u201cIrony of Trump tape,\u201d ran a Raheem tweet revealing a grasp of irony to make Alanis Morissette\u2019s look Sophoclean. \u201cThe left has pushed sex liberation &amp; filthy Hollywood culture for decades. Now complaining about the language it causes.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cComplaining about the language\u201d? Also, \u201cfilthy Hollywood culture\u201d? Obviously, no one expects Raheem to have a clue as to why so many Republican women are vocally enraged and disgusted by Trump\u2019s sexual assault boasts \u2013 he presumably last spoke to a female sometime during the Dubya administration. But it\u2019s an interesting choice to run for the Ukip leadership on a Mary Whitehouse platform, and he is advised to manage his expectations accordingly.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"2f162e0bb465f28cd12cf0a2e95d33020b678daa\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2f162e0bb465f28cd12cf0a2e95d33020b678daa/1986_427_1471_1840/799.jpg\" alt=\"Nigel Farage\" width=\"799\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Farage: Trump \u2018isn\u2019t running to be pope\u2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nicholas Kamm/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Back to Nigel, though. Back to our star. Clearly, this is the most concerted attempt to break America since Robbie Williams moved there for a decade and became the de facto leader of the Brits in LA for No Good Reason. Robbie\u2019s US career basically consisted of hosting five-a-side football matches for fellow time-rich expats such as Vinnie Jones. Farage\u2019s strategy, in contrast, is to get as close to Trump\u2019s campaign as he possibly can, build up his recognition Stateside, and hope it doesn\u2019t end up like <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/newsbeat/article/28926346/simon-cowell-has-revealed-why-he-sacked-cheryl-cole\">when Cheryl went to US X Factor</a>.</p> <p>Thus he\u2019ll do anything. Farage is now the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Ross\">Paul Ross</a> of the Trump campaign \u2013 as in, his answerphone message says: \u201cI\u2019ll do it.\u201d Wait \u2013 the candidate has been taped bragging about grabbing women\u2019s pussies? Fine, Nigel will go on Fox News to defend him. Like he told the anchor, Trump\u2019s apparent predilection for sexual assault was fine because \u201che\u2019s not running to be pope\u201d. Quite. That\u2019s the last way to get ahead in the Catholic church.</p> <p>Anyway, the pope bit was sufficiently splashy for Nigel to be invited into the post-debate spinroom, where he dispensed further look-at-me lines. Trump, Farage declared, was <a href=\"http://edition.cnn.com/2016/10/10/politics/nigel-farage-donald-trump-gorilla/\">\u201clike a big silverback gorilla\u201d</a> \u2013 an analysis that makes me wonder if those paw ashtrays are always morally wrong. Either way, the last thing you should think is that Nigel is coming off like a small fish in a massive pond. \u201cI\u2019ve been there myself,\u201d he mused of the first presidential debate. \u201cI remember my first debate.\u201d Thanking you, Obi-Wan.</p> <p>What is the endgame to all this? If Nigel has an Ari Gold figure, where is he steering him? My feeling is that Farage ultimately wants a berth on <a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/06/donald-trump-fox-republicans-network/487667/\">Trump TV</a>, the network Trump is rumoured to be launching should his presidential bid fail. Our natural instinct is probably to see Nigel occupying the Partridgean 3am-6am graveyard slot. Then again, in the world of Trump, maybe the small hours are prime time? God knows that\u2019s when the candidate has done some of his <a href=\"http://www.salon.com/2016/09/30/trump-goes-on-3am-tweetstorm-to-attack-former-miss-universe-check-out-her-sex-tape/\">most eye-catching work</a>.</p> <p>Or perhaps Nigel hopes Trump will employ him as a sidekick on his own show \u2013 kind of like Hank on Larry Sanders. The fear, naturally, is that Nigel will end up some kind of <a href=\"http://media.gettyimages.com/photos/australian-comedian-barry-humphries-as-his-professional-alter-ego-picture-id558933657\">Madge Allsop figure</a> \u2013 monstrously insulted and abused, but too beaten to find the courage to escape. All we can do is remind Nigel that lil\u2019 ol\u2019 Britannia will be waiting for him with open arms if all goes tits up. Leave a $10 bill on her nightstand, Nige, and tell her about the time you were big in America.</p>",
  "<p>The United Nations cultural and heritage body, Unesco, has condemned Israel\u2019s \u201cescalating aggressions\u201d regarding the holy site in Jerusalem\u2019s Old City, known to Muslims as al-Haram al-Sharif and to Jews as the Temple Mount, prompting a furious reaction from Israeli politicians.</p> <p>A resolution passed on Thursday denied the importance of the site to the Jewish faith by referring to it and the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/sep/13/palestinians-clash-police-jerusalem-al-aqsa-mosque\">al-Aqsa mosque</a> only by their Muslim names, the politicians said.<br></p> <p>The site has been a flashpoint between Muslims and rightwing Jews over the past two years in particular, although tensions in the vicinity stretch back decades.<br></p> <p>The resolution was backed by 24 countries, with six opposing it and 26 abstaining.

  "<p>In 2009 the international criminal court issued an arrest warrant for Sudanese president Omar al-Bashir on seven counts of crimes against humanity and war crimes. In 2010 it issued a further warrant on three counts of genocide. He is the only sitting head of state charged with committing genocide against his own people. In a majority Arab country, the ethnically African groups, especially those around the Darfur area, have long been politically marginalised. But since 2003 Bashir has been trying to systematically eliminate them, not least through his proxies, the hated Janjaweed (literally \u201cdevils on horseback\u201d) militia, notorious for their cruelty. To take one example out of many: in February 2004, the Janjaweed attacked a boarding school in Darfur, forcing 110 girls to strip at gunpoint before raping many of them and burning down their school. Little wonder tens of thousands have been fleeing for their lives.</p> <p>And it gets worse. Last month, <a href=\"https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2016/09/chemical-weapons-attacks-darfur/\" title=\"\">Amnesty International released a report</a> with evidence that, earlier this year, Bashir\u2019s air force had been dropping chemical weapons on some of the remoter villages. It is hard to get the soil samples that would fully evidence such a claim \u2013 foreigners, even UN-African Union peacekeepers \u2013 are not allowed in the region. But the horrific photographs of children with blistered skin and bleeding eyes look very much like the effects of some version of mustard gas. No, it\u2019s not a competition, but as the world is rightly concerned with the plight of the people of Aleppo, there are others \u2013 in perhaps more out of the way places \u2013 who get far less of our attention.</p> <p>But why has the UK government given no official statement on the evidence of chemical weapons use? Could it be that it wants to play down the significance of these attacks because the Bashir regime has now become an EU partner in the management of African immigration to Europe?</p> <p>Last November, at a meeting in Malta, the EU came up with <a href=\"http://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/meetings/international-summit/2015/11/11-12/\" title=\"\">the Khartoum process</a>. Desperate to respond to the migration \u201ccrisis\u201d, it signed an agreement for \u201cenhanced cooperation on migration and mobility\u201d, giving Sudan \u20ac100m over&#xa0;three years, with another \u20ac46m specifically allocated for border control, training border police and establishing holding centres. And it\u2019s often the Janjaweed that do the job of policing borders.</p> <p>Outrageous doesn\u2019t begin to cover it. Sudanese government officials are in London again this week for more \u201cstrategic dialogue\u201d on migration cooperation. It seems that, because European electorates are getting increasingly anxious about immigration, we are now prepared to make a deal with the devil, funding to the tune of many millions a man who would be arrested for genocide were he to step foot on our shores. And why? Because Bashir has promised to help the EU stop people fleeing to Europe at source. The fact that they are fleeing his death squads and chemical weapons attacks isn\u2019t being mentioned. We play down the genocide against his own people because he is now a valued \u201cpartner\u201d on immigration and at the centre of one of the established migration routes from the Horn of Africa.</p> <p>Not everyone is fleeing from Bashir\u2019s bombs. In South Sudan, for instance, a&#xa0;civil war has left tens of thousands on the very edge of starvation, living off goat bones and water lilies. In the capital, Juba, traders are now cutting their tomatoes in half because people can\u2019t afford to buy a whole one. To&#xa0;dismiss those who flee such horrors as mere \u201ceconomic migrants\u201d, as if all they want is some gilded consumer lifestyle of TVs and PlayStations, is wilfully blind and manifestly cruel.</p> <p>And, by the way, let\u2019s not blame any of this on Brexit. The shoddy Khartoum deal was an EU deal. And it took place over six months before we voted on EU membership. <a href=\"http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/eu-to-work-with-despot-in-sudan-to-keep-refugees-out-a-1092328.html\" title=\"\">Der Spiegel reported</a> that the 28 EU states had agreed to secrecy about the deal. \u201cUnder no circumstances\u201d should the public find out what was going on, the EU commission warned. Maybe that\u2019s why we are not hearing so much about Bashir dropping chemical weapons on his own people. Freaked by immigration, the EU is now prepared to do business with murderers.</p>",

There was always this question, will it work? Will it work in a person who has had an injury for a long time?\u201d</p> <p>Previously the same team had allowed paralysis patients to control a prosthetic arm using thought alone, but the addition of sense of touch is seen as crucial.</p> <p>\u201cWe know that without sensation, movement is really challenging,\u201d said Gaunt. \u201cWhat we\u2019ve added now is the ability to feel something through those fingers... We\u2019re feeding back touch that the artificial hand encounters when it makes contact with an object.\u201d</p> <p>In the trial, Copeland wore a neural implant for six months during which time he trained himself how to control the movement of the robotic arm.</p> <p>The scientists were able to evoke sensory feedback from the arm by electrically stimulating the precise brain areas that would normally light up when different areas of the hand are touched in a healthy person.</p> <p>When blindfolded, Copeland could tell which of the fingers on the prosthetic were being touched with 84% accuracy and he described 93% of the touch sensations he was given, such as pressing a cotton swab on the surface of the skin, as feeling \u201cpossibly natural.\u201d</p> <p>Until now, it was not clear how natural the sensations delivered by this kind of prosthesis would feel.</p> <p>\u201cThe most important result in this study is that microstimulation of sensory cortex can elicit natural sensation instead of tingling,\u201d said Andrew Schwartz, professor of neurobiology at University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, and a co-author. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2016/apr/13/brain-implant-paralysed-man-regain-partial-control-hand-neural-bypass\">Brain implant helps paralysed man regain partial control of his hand</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The advance could transform the lives of amputees and victims of spinal cord injuries, but also raises the possibility of more distant future applications, including human enhancement.</p> <p>Copeland was in his first year of college doing a degree in nanofabrication when he had his accident, which left him unable to feel or move his lower arms and legs, and needing assistance with all his daily activities. \u201cIn 2004, I wrecked my car and I broke my neck,\u201d he said. \u201cI was 18. It was raining and I had taken a turn too fast. I never really liked driving to begin with.\u201d</p> <p>He tried to continue his studies, but health problems forced him to put his degree on hold and he kept busy by going to concerts and volunteering for the Pittsburgh Japanese Culture Society, which holds conventions on Japanese cartoons. </p> <p>After being selected for the trial, Copeland had surgery, during which four tiny microelectrodes - each about half the size of a shirt button - were implanted into his brain. Prior to the surgery, imaging techniques were used to identify the exact regions in his brain corresponding to feelings in each of his fingers and his palm.</p> <p>The electrodes read out electrical activity from one region - the motor area - to control the movement of the hand and electrically stimulated another region linked to sensation to induce a sense of touch.</p> <p>\u201cThe ultimate goal is to create a system which moves and feels just like a natural arm would,\u201d said Gaunt. \u201cWe have a long way to go to get there, but this is a great start.\u201d</p> <p>The team released <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/sep/14/robotic-hand-wired-directly-into-brain-feel-again-darpa\">preliminary findings last year</a>.

  "<p>Hundreds of people have been wrongly refused bank accounts or had their driving licences revoked under the former home secretary <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/oct/10/immigration-bill-theresa-may-hostile-environment\">Theresa May\u2019s measures to \u201ccreate a hostile environment for illegal immigrants\u201d</a>, the immigration watchdog has revealed.</p> <p>David Bolt, the chief inspector of borders and immigration, said the Home Office had failed to appreciate the potential impact of such wrong decisions on those affected. </p> <p>His <a href=\"http://icinspector.independent.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Hostile-environment-driving-licences-and-bank-accounts-January-to-July-2016.pdf\">report, published on Thursday</a>, shows that more than 250 people who had their driving licences revoked last year had been wrongfully identified as being in the UK illegally, as had 10% of those denied a bank or building society account.</p> <p>The chief inspector\u2019s first assessment of the initial 2014 phase of May\u2019s \u201chostile environment measures\u201d to deny public and private services to people with no legal right to be in the UK raises questions about whether ministers were justified in pressing ahead with phase two, due to come into effect next year. </p> <p>The second phase will create a new offence of driving unlawfully in Britain, and banks and building societies will be empowered to close the accounts of immigrants who are in the country illegally and freeze their assets.</p> <p>Bolt said there was insufficient hard evidence to determine whether the measures were achieving what the government intended, such as an increase in those voluntarily returning home. A proper evaluation was needed, he said, not least because of concerns about the potential damage of the measures to individuals and communities.</p> <p>In a separate report commissioned by May in January when she was home secretary, the chief inspector revealed that almost 200,000 foreign nationals had been arrested in 2014-15 in England and Wales. But the police asked the Home Office to carry out immigration status checks on only 30% of the foreign nationals arrested outside London. When the Metropolitan police force was included, the proportion whose immigration status was checked rose to just over 50%.</p> <p>The \u201chostile measures\u201d report reveals that 9,732 people had their driving licences revoked in 2015 after Home Office checks on their immigration status \u2013 close to the 10,000 a year target set by ministers. In total, 20,000 people have had their driving licences revoked since the measure was introduced in July 2014. </p> <p>Bolt said, however, that human error and poor quality Home Office data led to 259 people who were not in the country illegally having their driving licences revoked in 2015, and the Driving and Vehicle Licensing Agency had to reinstate them.</p> <p>\u201cWhile these cases amounted to a small percentage of the total numbers of revocations, the Home Office did not appear to appreciate the seriousness of such errors for the individuals affected,\u201d said the chief inspector.</p> <p>\u201cThis was particularly true where a licence had been revoked when the individual had departed the UK before their leave had expired.\u201d In such cases, if the person returned without knowing their licence had been revoked they faced being disqualified if they drove on British roads.</p> <p>He said only 583 of the 9,732 people who had their licences revoked in 2015 subsequently left the country. On top of that, only 475 revoked licences were actually returned to the DVLA in 2014-15.</p> <p>Bolt said it was not possible to say how many people were refused a bank or building society account on the grounds of being in the country illegally because the 2014 law does not require them to report customer refusals from immigration status checks.<br></p> <p>But, he said, a sample of 169 case files of those refused accounts showed that 17 (10%) should not have been listed as \u201cdisqualified persons\u201d on immigration grounds, despite the list being updated weekly.</p> <p> A Home Office spokesperson said: \u201cAs the home secretary announced earlier this month, we will be introducing measures that will mean that banks will have to do regular checks to ensure that they are not providing banking services to illegal migrants. Furthermore, we are introducing a new power to search for and seize UK driving licences held by those living in the UK unlawfully. </p> <p> \u201cThe measures discussed in the independent chief inspector\u2019s report should not be seen in isolation, but as part of the wider action we are taking that has made it harder than ever before for illegal migrants to live in this country.\u201d</p>",

A brain injury is not a joke.\u201d</p> <p>Trump\u2019s remarks come at a time of intense pressure on the NFL over player safety. Thousands of former football players launched a class-action lawsuit against the league, claiming the NFL hid known concussion risks, leading to high rates of dementia, depression and even suicides.</p> <p>The NFL settled out of court in a deal worth a potential $1bn, but some of the players have asked the supreme court to block the payout because it does not provide adequate compensation for all neurological disorders.</p>",

The mosque would only require a small section of the land, which would otherwise be used for a cemetery, a park and possibly a school.</p> <p>Newton County is solid Trump country, however, and the presidential candidate\u2019s suspicion of Muslim immigrants revealed itself in local reaction. On 11 August, county commissioner John Douglas asked in the <a href=\"http://www.rockdalecitizen.com/news/local/reaction-to-mosque-plan-mostly-critical/article_45e8eeff-64cb-5274-b11b-94b3361f68b2.html\">Rockdale Citizen</a> newspaper: \u201cWould building those things make us a prime area for the federal government to resettle refugees from the Middle East?\u201d</p> <p>Soon there was a Facebook page, called Stop the Mosque, alongside videos of armed and masked men firing weapons and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWnWrsHN_wI&amp;feature=youtu.be\">setting off explosives</a> in Georgia\u2019s woodlands. The hashtags, the camouflage getup and clumsy maneuvers might have seemed silly, except the ammunition and demolition equipment were real. </p> <p>By mid-August, Newton County\u2019s commissioners had enacted a temporary ban on building any places of worship, a reversal for a body that a few years ago passed a <a href=\"http://www.co.newton.ga.us/home/showdocument?id=1434\">zoning ordinance</a> designed to allow unimpeded construction of places described as \u201ccathedral, chapel, church, synagogue, temple, mosque, tabernacle\u201d.</p> <p>An opposing outcry arose in support of the mosque, and the US Department of Justice reviewed a complaint by the Council on American-Islamic Relations. Under pressure, the commission set a date in mid-September to lift the ban.

But according to the <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.iiisecurityforce.com/\">group\u2019s site</a> and <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/GSFIII/\">social media</a>, its members hold a range of contradictory views. </p> <p>They are training to fight both the US government and enemies of the US government; they wave both the American flag and the southern Confederate battle flag; they say they support the US constitution but not the right of Muslims to express religious freedom. </p> <p>As the Newton County meeting approached, the GSF released a video set outside a church across the road from the mosque\u2019s proposed site. In it the force\u2019s members \u2013 some paunchy and gray, some teenage and waifish \u2013 stood in poses, holding up three-fingers like a misplaced street gang. But their guns were real and their rhetoric was incendiary.</p> <p>The video has since been taken down but Hill, <a href=\"http://www.rawstory.com/2016/09/construction-of-georgia-mosque-halted-due-to-threats-by-armed-militia/\">a former US marine</a>, claimed the proposed mosque had ties to Isis training, the September 11 attacks, the Boston marathon bombing, the Fort Hood shooting and more. Its members, he said, followed the antichrist. Another man hung an American flag on what appeared to be the mosque\u2019s future site, an act which would have required trespassing.</p> <p>The posts shook the Newton County commission.

After the GSF bullied the Newton County commission, <a href=\"http://ezellbrownforsheriff.com/\">Sheriff Ezell Brown</a> pledged to investigate the group.

He was improperly described as a killer. </p> <p>That killer reference has now been removed from <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3715451/A-bloody-outrage-decorated-Para-facing-prosecution-44-years-shooting-dead-IRA-killer-blood-soaked-men-terror-know-ll-never-face-justice-thanks-Blair-s-squalid-peace-deal.html\">the online version of the story</a>, which carries a note at the foot of the article in similar terms to the one published in the newspaper\u2019s print edition.<br></p> <p>I note from <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/patfinucane.centre/\">the Facebook page of the Pat Finucane Centre</a> that the Mail\u2019s climbdown followed complaints from McCann\u2019s family and involved \u201cseveral weeks of to-ing and fro-ing.\u201d</p> <p>That doesn\u2019t surprise me because the Mail is renowned for its desire to avoid correcting or apologising. Although the paper doesn\u2019t say sorry, the brief paragraph is about as close as it ever gets to doing so.</p> <p>But there is another issue here, and that is the unsung influence of the existence of the Independent Press Standards Organisation (Ipso).</p> <p>My hunch is that the Mail decided to bow to the family\u2019s will because it did not want to face what surely would have been a negative ruling by the regulator.</p> <p>There wasn\u2019t a scintilla of evidence to support its description of McCann as a killer. It was a gross factual inaccuracy and therefore very upsetting to his surviving family.</p> <p>It should not have required much to-ing and fro-ing for the Mail to have done the right thing, although I can well imagine what happened. After the initial complaint, the paper would have stood by its story.</p> <p>Only when that stock defence was no longer tenable did it realise it would need to agree terms. Although that isn\u2019t necessarily in the spirit of press regulation, it says much for its desire to avoid censure by Ipso that it acceded to the family\u2019s request.</p> <p>In such circumstances, as the Pat Finuncane Centre remarked: \u201cIt\u2019s not often that a bereaved Irish family takes on one of the mightiest of the British press corporations and wins.\u201d Ipso was their silent helper.</p>",

(See<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/oct/13/boris-johnson-brexit-foreign-affairs-committee-quizzed-by-mps-over-brexit-as-pound-falls-again-politics-live?page=with:block-57ff6255e4b01ffb8ffcb3da#block-57ff6255e4b01ffb8ffcb3da\"> 11.33am.) </a>In some respects, this sounded more like a negotiating gambit than a statement of intent. As my colleague <strong>Severin Carrell </strong>points out (see <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/oct/13/boris-johnson-brexit-foreign-affairs-committee-quizzed-by-mps-over-brexit-as-pound-falls-again-politics-live?page=with:block-57ff6ae1e4b047a4eaafc0e3#block-57ff6ae1e4b047a4eaafc0e3\">12.12pm), </a>there are still considerable obstacles to winning a second independence referendum. Sturgeon does not have the power to call a legally-binding independence referendum, and Theresa May has hinted that, unlike David Cameron in 2014,<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/oct/02/conservative-conference-may-to-explain-brexit-great-repeal-bill-in-marr-interview-politics-live?page=with:block-57f11d1ce4b015be63833667#block-57f11d1ce4b015be63833667\"> she would not facilitate such a poll. </a>Sturgeon also seems to be ignoring the promise she made last year, which was that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2015/oct/15/snp-conference-politics-live?page=with:block-561f77d9e4b0a565784b9ab1#block-561f77d9e4b0a565784b9ab1\">she would not call a second independence referendum unless there was \u201cstrong evidence that a significant number of those who voted No have changed their minds\u201d. </a>At the moment that evidence does not exist.</p> <ul> <li><strong>She made remaining in the single market Scotland\u2019s key priority.</strong></li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The prime minister may have a mandate to take England and Wales out of the EU but she has no mandate whatsoever to remove any part of the UK from the single market.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>She said she wanted Scotland to acquire extensive new powers.</strong> She explained that she would be developing a Brexit plan for Scotland and that, if Scotland were not to become independent, it needed to acquire new powers to ensure that it did not lose out from Brexit.</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The Scottish government will set out a plan for Scotland.</p> <p>We will seek to make this plan a key element of the UK\u2019s Article 50 negotiation.</p> <p>It will require substantial additional powers for the Scottish Parliament.</p> <p>All the powers in our areas of responsibility that currently lie with the EU - and significant new powers too.</p> <p>Powers to strike international deals.</p> <p>And greater powers over immigration. Powers not just to protect our economy, but also our values.</p> <p>UK ministers might believe it acceptable to order businesses to create lists of foreign workers.</p> <p>We do not.</p> </blockquote> <p>This passage suggests that, as an alternative to a second independence referendum, Sturgeon is demanding a new version of independence-lite.</p> <ul> <li><strong>She said a second independence referendum would not be a re-run of the last one.</strong></li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>There is one final point I want to make. And it\u2019s an important one.</p> <p>When Scotland does come to take this decision again - whenever that might be - we must not take for granted how anyone will vote.<br></p> <p>It will be a new debate - not a rerun of 2014.</p> <p>We must not assume that people\u2019s views - yes or no - are the same today as they were two years ago.</p> <p>Instead we must engage the arguments with a fresh eye and an open mind.</p> <p>The case for independence will have to be made and won.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>She said the SNP would vote against the proposed \u201cgreat repeal bill\u201d - the bill planned for the next session of parliament to repeal the European Communities Act 1972.</strong></li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I can confirm today that SNP MPs will vote against the Brexit bill when it come before the House of Commons next year.</p> <p>That Bill will repeal the legislation that enacted our EU membership. Scotland didn\u2019t vote for that and so neither will our MPs.</p> <p>But we will also work to persuade others - Labour, Liberals and moderate Tories - to join us in a coalition against a hard Brexit: not just for Scotland, but for the whole UK.</p> <p>In practice this is unlikely to make much difference because Labour is unlikely to vote against the bill at second reading. Many Labour MPs are opposed to a \u201chard\u201d Brexit, but most of them do not intend to right against the principle of the UK leaving the EU.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>She said the Conservatives were pushing for a hard Brexit for which they had no mandate.</strong></li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>They are using the [referendum] result as cover for a hard Brexit for which they have no mandate - but which they are determined to impose, regardless of the ruinous consequences.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>She accused the Conservatives of embracing Ukip-style xenophobia and said their views had \u201cno place in a civilised society\u201d.</strong></li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Last week, in Birmingham, we heard an intolerance towards those from other countries that has no place in a modern, multicultural, civilised society.</p> <p>You know, on the day of the prime minister\u2019s speech to the Tory conference, the new leader of UKIP resigned.</p> <p>Perhaps she realized that her job and her party are now redundant.</p> <p>Last week, we saw the Tories adopt UKIP policy and Farage-style rhetoric - lock, stock and beer-barrel.</p> <p>It was a disgrace. It shames the Tory party and all who speak for it.</p> <p>But make no mistake - the right wing of the Tory party is now in the ascendancy and it is seeking to hijack the referendum result.</p> <p>Brexit has become Tory Brexit.</p> <p>The rampant right wing of the party are using it as license for the xenophobia that has long lain under the surface - but which is now in full, unlovely view.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>She compared Theresa May to Margaret Thatcher. </strong>This was noteworthy because of Thatcher\u2019s continuing unpopularity in Scotland.</li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>Sturgeon said that even though 1m Scots voted for Brexit, they did not vote for the hard Brexit now on offer from the Tories.</strong></li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Of course, I know that one million of our fellow citizens voted to Leave. They did so for a range of legitimate reasons and as first minister, I have a duty to listen to, to understand and to respond to these reasons.</p> <p>But I suspect that many of those who voted to Leave, look now at the actions and rhetoric of the Tories and think \u2018that\u2019s not what I voted for\u2019.</p> <p>They may have voted to take back control.</p> <p>But I can\u2019t imagine many of them voted to hand control to the unholy trinity of Boris Johnson, David Davis and Liam Fox ...</p> <p>They didn\u2019t vote to throw economic rationality out of the window.</p> <p>They didn\u2019t vote to lower their own living standards or to sacrifice jobs and investment.</p> <p>They didn\u2019t vote for our businesses to face tariffs or for holiday-makers to need visas.</p> <p>They didn\u2019t vote for the scapegoating of foreigners.</p> </blockquote> <p>Sturgeon\u2019s language at this point in the speech is similar to what has been said by Philip Hammond, the chancellor, who has also been arguing that the referendum vote was not a vote for \u201chard\u201d Brexit.

Here is an extract from <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/6a4e6bd4-84ae-11e6-8897-2359a58ac7a5\">a withering column about him that <strong>Philip Stephens </strong>published in the Financial Times (subscription) recently.</a></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Word in Westminster has it that Boris Johnson would like to apologise personally to Barack Obama for raising his \u201cpart-Kenyan\u201d ancestry when the US president backed the pro-Europeans during the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/topics/themes/Brexit\">EU referendum</a>. Word in Washington is that the UK foreign secretary would do as well not to bother. Such slights are not easily forgotten by the first African-American president.</p> <p>Mr Johnson seems to have something of a problem with, well, foreigners. Fellow Europeans have not forgiven the mendacity of the EU \u201cout\u201d campaign. Some in Africa may recall his allusions, albeit some while ago, to \u201cpiccaninnies\u201d and \u201cwatermelon smiles\u201d. He says such remarks have been taken out of context. <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/2e356f76-84bd-11e6-a29c-6e7d9515ad15\">Visiting Ankara this week</a> he presumably told his hosts something similar about the Leave campaign\u2019s scaremongering about Turkish migrants.</p> <p>Foreign policy is a serious business, the more so in an age of global upheaval and rising disorder. Mr Johnson looks more comfortable in the role of court jester than thoughtful policymaker. He prefers the broad brush to irksome detail. His Italian opposite number Paolo Gentiloni was left baffled when Mr Johnson proposed a post-Brexit grand bargain: Italy would back open access to the EU for London\u2019s financial industry and Britain would continue to drink lots of Italian prosecco.</p> <p>Word in Berlin is that Frank-Walter Steinmeier, the intensely serious German foreign minister, can scarcely abide being in the same room as Mr Johnson. <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/3b1a3c3e-81b7-11e6-8e50-8ec15fb462f4\">Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble</a>, Germany\u2019s finance minister, has mocked the foreign secretary\u2019s shallow grasp of the way the union works by offering to send him the Lisbon treaty. Finance ministers, he remarked waspishly, were \u201caccustomed to having a high degree of respect for foreign ministers\u201d. It might be added that Theresa May, the prime minister, is banking on Berlin\u2019s support to secure a good deal in the Brexit negotiations.</p> <p>Allies say that Mr Johnson is \u201ca quick read\u201d \u2014 when paying attention, he absorbs information easily. Whitehall no doubt has laid on crash seminars on the workings of the world. The foreign secretary does not help himself, though, by addressing fellow ministers in the manner of Bertie Wooster, the twittish toff from the pages of English humorist PG Wodehouse. The other day Mr Johnson sat down with the hard-bitten Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov. An unkind observer might have imagined Wodehouse\u2019s Wooster meeting Machiavelli\u2019s Prince.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57ff3822e4b01d9dd2c9074f\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-13T08:03:14.594Z\">9.03am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Who\u2019d have guessed that Brexit would trigger a national Marmite shortage?

  "<p>Falling Water, USA\u2019s new sci-fi thriller about lucid dreamers and those trying to control them, wants its central mystery to be like a crushing tsunami that everyone is anxiously bracing for as they see resolution inching toward them week after week. Instead it\u2019s more like the drone of the ocean, which will lull you right to sleep. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/oct/10/best-tv-this-week-graves-goliath-american-housewife\">The week's best TV: Graves, Goliath and American Housewife</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Unlike many other sci-fi shows, Falling Water isn\u2019t about time travel, zombies, or magic smoke monsters, it\u2019s about the most human thing of all: dreams. It focuses on three people with super special dreaming abilities: Tess (Lizzie Brocher\u00e9, struggling mightily with her American accent) a trend spotter with a shaky mental health record; Taka (Will Yun Lee), an NYPD detective caring for his catatonic mother; and Burton (David Ajala), the head of security at a shadowy Wall Street firm. </p> <p>Tess has recurring dreams about a seven-year-old son who doesn\u2019t exist even though he also shows up in the dreams of many others. When Burton is having a relationship with the woman of his dreams (literally) the blond boy is there tossing a tennis ball with him. Same goes for Taka, who chases his mother and the boy through the woods while he sleeps. They all seem to be united by a few things: Tess\u2019s involvement with a billionaire (Zak Orth) who is trying to connect people \u201ccerebral cortex to cerebral cortex\u201d while they\u2019re asleep, Taka\u2019s investigation of a cult that worships pictures of Tess\u2019s \u201cson\u201d, and Burton\u2019s involvement with a paranoid Belgian businessman and an associate who has gotten rich making trades for some mysterious organization called Topeka. </p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4InXOM3PmA\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/m4InXOM3PmA?wmode=opaque\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>Repeatedly, details from one of their stories pops up in another\u2019s, trying to knit a coherent whole. It seems like there are at least two groups trying to control (and possibly kill people) through their nightmares and these three are the linchpins to their intersection. Just like Lost, it is almost impossible to tease these mysteries out and come up with something substantive. However, what makes Lost a classic and Falling Water a washout is that Lost always focused first and foremost on its characters. Even as the conspiracies got deeper and weirder, each character\u2019s personality and motivations did too. The same thing happens on The Walking Dead, where Falling Water co-creator Gale Anne Hurd is an executive producer, as we see how different characters react to the end of the world. </p> <p>The trio at the center of Falling Water is as generic as they could possibly be. Even Tess\u2019s defining characteristics \u2013 a past in a mental institution and a psychologist mother who documented her entire childhood \u2013 have shades of Brenda on Six Feet Under and Rachel from UnREAL. Taka is a detective right from central casting and Burton is so bland that when he shares a scene with a banana split you\u2019d much rather be paying attention to the sundae. </p> <p>A surreal mystery is not enough to sustain a series, especially when the rules of what goes on in dreams, how they\u2019re all intersecting, and what each person is capable of when in a REM state are never explained. If we knew whether or not the faceless men that stalk people\u2019s dreams were fatal they might actually be scary. Otherwise they\u2019re just slightly gory distractions. It\u2019s as if Falling Water is afraid that by giving anything away they\u2019ll run out of story or viewers will be so unimpressed that they won\u2019t tune in. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/oct/05/frequency-tv-review-dennis-quaid\">Frequency review \u2013 time travel thriller is surprise small screen winner</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Just as the physics of the dreamscapes are impossible to understand, the film-making around them is a little bland as well. The most disorienting thing is that sometimes water seems to flow upwards. Otherwise the dreams look like normal life but everything is a little more fraught with Freudian meaning. David Lynch created dreams in Twin Peaks that were so disturbing and obliquely telling that they are petrifying even decades later. Falling Water misses all of these opportunities to befuddle us in conspiracies that may or may not ever be explained. </p> <p>Ultimately the show is too precious by half and too confusing by a third. Actually, it\u2019s not that confusing, but when there is no person to really care about, viewers might find it hard to be engrossed in the tangled world that the writers are presenting. In the end, the only reason worth sticking with this show is to find out what it\u2019s withholding from us. Honestly, I\u2019d give up on that resolution for one good night of vivid dreams. </p>",

  "<p>In 1982 the first <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/aids-and-hiv\">Aids</a> centre and helpline was opened in San Francisco to help disseminate advice among the district\u2019s gay community about a strange emerging disease. The centre didn\u2019t use the terms Aids or HIV, because the disease didn\u2019t yet have a name. It was called the Kaposi\u2019s Sarcoma Foundation, after the telltale lesions that appeared on the skin of those infected with HIV. San Francisco was the heart of the Aids epidemic and is the setting for Rabih Alameddine\u2019s moving new book, which looks back from the present to the 1980s, when the epidemic was at its height.</p> <p>In his last but one novel, <em>The Hakawati</em>, Alameddine married the epic tales of the Arabic professional storyteller (the \u201chakawati\u201d) with a story of familial relations, as a brother and his sister keep vigil by their dying father\u2019s side. The voice of Alameddine\u2019s hakawati was arch, often camp, terrifying and emotive. For his new book Alameddine returns to this highly successful combination of a realist narrative with epic chronicling. <em>The Angel of History</em> tells the story of Jacob, a gay, Yemeni-born poet living in San Francisco, as he waits to check into a mental health facility sometime in the present day. The novel is framed around the single night he spends in the waiting room.</p> <p>Meanwhile, in Jacob\u2019s apartment and with his cat Behemoth for company, Satan and Death perform an intellectual duel if not for Jacob\u2019s soul, then for his sanity. Satan plays the lead role, urging Jacob to remember his past, while Death \u2013 dour, languid and uninterested \u2013 would have him forget (\u201cDeath can ruin everything with a single touch. Oblivion is his trade\u201d). Satan holds court with Death and, one by one, with the 14 saints who have safeguarded Jacob, from his beginnings with a prostitute mother in a Cairo brothel, to life with his wealthy father in Lebanon, through the torment of Catholic boarding school. It\u2019s among San Francisco\u2019s queers that he finally finds a place where he is not shunned but welcomed.</p> <p>Jacob has gone to the psychiatric clinic partly because he can hear Satan speaking to him, but also because of a public meltdown in a smart San Francisco restaurant, occasioned by a chance remark about a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/joan-didion\">Joan Didion</a> memoir. Jacob is struggling, decades on, with the death of his partner Doc from Aids \u2013 and not just Doc, but the entire group of friends: Greg and Lou and Pinto and Chris and Jim, who died agonisingly, one by one, nursed by Jacob who alone managed to survive. The memories of their deaths (\u201cblood wintering in the floor\u2019s cracks\u201d) are heart-wrenching and interspersed throughout the novel. Surviving turns out to be a lonely business and, in a series of unfulfilling encounters, a dazed Jacob spends the following years trying to restore what he has lost. Eventually he loses his faith in many things, but most of all in his beloved poetry. He wants only to forget and this is what Satan, suitably sardonic and sharply dressed, tries to stop him doing, urging him back to the knowledge that might yet save him.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>This is a story of one life and many themes: death and sex; religion; war; love and loss and the need to remember</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Having survived one kind of war, namely the assault on homosexual life by Aids in the 80s, Joseph finds himself in another as his adoptive country starts sending killer drones over the countries he grew up in. Here and there the novel takes surreal and daring turns. One chapter is narrated by an unknown guest at a party where the hosts keep a pet Arab in a cage. In another a downed drone falls in love with a village boy named Mohamed, is recovered by the American army, rebooted and sent out again. \u201cSure, I enjoyed bombing Jeeps and camels in Yemen, jerry-built shacks in Afghanistan and holes-in-the-wall in Pakistan, mud huts in Somalia, loved watching terrorists and collateral damage explode and disintegrate,\u201d says the drone \u2013 but, like Jacob, its memory is holding something back. Eventually it flies over Mohamed\u2019s village, and, after spying the boy\u2019s bare buttocks being thrashed in the square, drives out the jihadists and turns it into a capitalist\u2019s dream with a Wendy\u2019s and McDonald\u2019s. The villagers are bombed into conforming to western values, just as gay men were bullied by the dominant culture.</p> <p>Like Alameddine\u2019s last book, the National Book award-shortlisted <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/jan/28/an-unnecessary-woman-rabih-alameddine-review-novel\"><em>An Unnecessary Woman</em></a>, this is a story of one life and many themes: in this case, death and sex; religion; war; the purpose of art and of love and loss; and the need to remember. Here is a book, full of story, unrepentantly political at every level. At a time when many western writers seem to be in retreat from saying anything that could be construed as political, Alameddine says it all, shamelessly, gloriously and, realised like his Satan, in the most stylish of forms.</p> <p>\u2022 <em>Angel of History </em>is published by Constable &amp; Robinson<em>. </em>To order a copy for \u00a315.57 (RRP \u00a318.99) go to <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/angel-of-history-435677.html?utm_source=editoriallink&amp;utm_medium=merch&amp;utm_campaign=article\">bookshop.theguardian.com</a> or call 0330 333 6846.

  "<p>In my 20 or so years working with the development sector I\u2019ve long been extremely uncomfortable with the idea that we in the \u201cnorth\u201d know better than those in the \u201csouth\u201d. We certainly have more material resources, and so more power and opportunities than many, but development as something rich people do to poor people doesn\u2019t gel well with me. Nowadays, many people working in development would agree with this view.</p> <p>And yet we still send our workers to developing countries to \u201cbuild capacity\u201d; we send young volunteers there to help out in their gap year; and we constantly lecture poorer countries about the vagaries of everything from corruption to inequality. Ahem \u2026 glass houses? <br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2016/mar/13/do-international-ngos-still-have-the-right-to-exist\">Do international NGOs still have the right to exist?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>So I\u2019ve concluded that the next generation of \u201cdevelopment\u201d should turn this equation on its head. The sustainable development goals (SDGs) were lauded, in part, because they were universal: yes, Sierra Leone or Vietnam has to adopt them but so, too, does the UK. We may be able to offer financial resources to the south, but the south has a considerable store of knowledge to offer us, too. \u201cReverse development\u201d is what we need, and we should set up a northern based agency staffed by southerners to help build our own capacity to meet the SDGs. Some examples come to mind. </p> <h2><strong>Gender equality (goal five)</strong> </h2> <p>Nicaragua, Rwanda and Ecuador all rank higher than the UK in the <a href=\"http://reports.weforum.org/global-gender-gap-report-2014/rankings/\" rel=\"nofollow\">World Economic Forum\u2019s global gender gap</a>. Fewer than a third of our MPs are women, ranking us 49th in the world in terms of the number of women in national parliaments. Many developing countries are doing far better. What can we learn from them? How did they achieve it? What systems do we need to put in place? </p> <h2><strong>Affordable and clean energy (goal seven)<br></strong></h2> <p>Micro grid and off grid, affordable solar energy is taking off in the developing world. Rather than waiting for mega projects many, such as <a href=\"http://meragaopower.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Mera Gao Power</a> in Uttar Pradesh, India, or <a href=\"http://www.karibusolar.com/about-us/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Karibu</a> solar in Tanzania, are showing how it\u2019s done. Where are our energy social entrepreneurs? We have a swath of community energy projects, but large Hinkley-style money pits still dominate our energy landscape. Can we learn from the southern social entrepreneurs and just get on with it? Can they build our capacity to innovate? <br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2016/sep/02/philanthropists-revolution-libraries-grassroots\">The trouble with philanthropy is that money can't buy equality</a> </p> </aside>  <h2><strong>Sustainable consumption (goal 12)</strong> </h2> <p>Several development economists, from Amartya Sen to Manfred Max Neef, have looked at the role of wellbeing and poverty, and considered wellbeing to be the ultimate aim, rather than macro-level economic growth, jobs, or even income. People in developing countries can help us gain a much better understanding of how to live the good life, while consuming less. Clearly, the poor don\u2019t have enough material needs or security to have high levels of wellbeing. But having a higher income and consuming more isn\u2019t necessarily a recipe to success either. Rather than exporting our overladen consumer culture to the south, we should be learning from and listening to those whose lives are reported as having high levels of satisfaction, yet who consume fewer material resources. </p> <h2><strong>Peace, justice and strong institutions (goal 16)</strong></h2> <p>Western criminal justice systems are almost entirely based on punishment for bad behaviour. <a href=\"https://www.unodc.org/pdf/criminal_justice/06-56290_Ebook.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">In many African countries</a>, and indigenous communities through the world, customary law focuses more on reconciliation and social responsibility. Especially for low-risk offenders, it has been shown to be more effective in reducing repeat offences. Rather than building more prisons, can we bring expertise from these communities to help us build the skills and capacity we need to introduce successful restorative justice programmes here at home? <br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2016/jul/18/call-to-arms-end-report-writing-madness\">A call to arms: end this report writing madness now</a> </p> </aside>  <h2><strong>Partnerships for sustainable development (goal 17) </strong> </h2> <p>If Brexit and the rise of Trump tell us anything, it\u2019s that people feel disenfranchised and want more, rather than less, control over decisions that affect them directly. Brazil provides one of the best case studies, where dozens of communities are engaged in democratic processes over local public investment priorities, under the guise of \u201cparticipatory budgeting\u201d. <a href=\"http://www.fiscaltransparency.net/resourcesfiles/files/20150704112.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">Research</a> from Brazil shows that this leads to increases in public spending on social programmes, from health and education to water and sanitation. </p> <p>In India, similar results were found across communities in the southern state of Kerala, where participatory budgeting led to significant improvements in roads, housing and child services. Why aren\u2019t we doing more of this in the developed world? </p> <p>Other examples come to mind \u2013 the digital economy is adapting far more rapidly in some parts of the south, such as India, than in the north. Care of older people, meanwhile, also has elements we need to adopt more of in the north, such as how to look after extended families in the home. </p> <p>Development is no longer a one-way street. \u201cReverse development\u201d may be as important for the next 60 years, as north-south development has been for the past 60. <br></p> <p><strong><a href=\"https://register.theguardian.com/global-development\">Join our community</a></strong><strong> of development professionals and humanitarians.

Star, played by Sasha Lane, is a dirt-poor teenager with nothing to lose who joins a travelling gang roaming the country selling magazine subscriptions door-to-door, living in shared motel rooms, partying, drinking, fighting, playing loud music, and making extra money in each town selling sex or stealing from the customers\u2019 houses where they have been unwisely allowed in.</p> <p>The faces are extraordinary: pretty/unpretty, with the hard mask-like blank of youth, guys with powerful bodies like loaded weapons, scribbled on with tattoos. Star falls in love with the crew\u2019s top salesman, motormouth predator Jake (Shia LaBeouf), to the simmering rage of Jake\u2019s girlfriend, queen-bee crew manager Krystal, a tremendous performance from Riley Keough.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y1SpWZm1PLc\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/y1SpWZm1PLc?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>I still think that at times this film, Arnold\u2019s first set in the US, looks a bit self-conscious in its learned Americanness and white-trash milieu, like a very accomplished pastiche homage to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/larry-clark\">Larry Clark</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/harmony-korine\">Harmony Korine</a> or the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/gus-van-sant\">Gus Van Sant</a> of Elephant: it\u2019s presented in the austerely boxy aspect ratio of 4:3, to emphasise single shots and closeups. LaBeouf\u2019s scenery-chewing, furniture-smashing performance could have been reined in more, and it is incidentally not believable that you can steal a Buick convertible belonging to three cowboys after shooting up their backyard pool patio without the police getting involved.</p> <p>American Honey is a movie in search of an ending and in search of a meaning. But the search is the point, or rather the point is taking the journey and realising afterwards that it has been a search, or even in fact not fully realising. And Arnold\u2019s ambition and reach are really exciting: the way she immerses you in the mood and the moment, letting her characters drift to the edge of chaos, capable of investing the least little thing with reportage poetry. She finds some great unprofessional cameos, including a glorious appearance from a little girl whose favourite song is the Dead Kennedys\u2019 I Kill Children. Arnold also has this year\u2019s zeitgeist bragging rights for making cocky Jake compare his own dress sense to that of his hero: Donald Trump. (Was that an improvised line from LaBeouf?) As in a reality TV show, the week\u2019s two lowest-earning salespersons have to fight it out in some nearby waste ground.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bcd9c104bc8eace949ba14a3ee15388e500fb6b1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bcd9c104bc8eace949ba14a3ee15388e500fb6b1/0_346_5184_3110/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Living on the edge \u2026 American Honey.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Living on the edge \u2026 American Honey.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/Film4</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>A second viewing alerted me to the pattern of visual echoes and internal rhymes. When Star and the others arrive in Kansas City, one claims, awestruck, that this is where Superman lives. And a few minutes later, we see someone\u2019s dog by the roadside, dressed up in a cape and red Superdog pants. The title is taken from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/lady-antebellum\">Lady Antebellum</a>\u2019s country song American Honey, which is mentioned at the beginning and sung by the crew at the end. The first time round I found it moving but was then fractionally disconcerted by the fact that this song does not lead straight into the closing credits.

So is the one where haughty and jealous Krystal, in her confederate-flag bikini, summons Star into her motel room and humiliates Jake by making him rub suncream all over her while she gives Star a managerial dressing down.</p> <p>Arnold is known for Brit social-realist gems such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2006/oct/27/thriller\">Red Road</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2009/sep/10/fish-tank-review\">Fish Tank</a> and for her masterpiece: the much-misunderstood <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/nov/10/wuthering-heights-film-review\">Wuthering Heights</a>, which in its raw, radical simplicity appeared to predate the literary work. And American Honey? It\u2019s not social realism in the British sense; maybe it\u2019s closer to New Wave, a <em>nouvelle vague americaine </em>with its youth, sex and outlaw freedom.

  "<p>Ten years ago, Karen Marie \u00d8rsted was one half of a Danish feminist anarcho-punk duo whose repertoire included a song called Pussy in Your Face. Starting in 2007, she and her friend Josefine spent five years crusading across Europe drunk, rousing riots in squats, making naff nu-rave-styled videos and shouting: \u201cFuck the government!\u201d to anyone who would listen.

Her voice is a little hoarse \u2013 a cold has arrived with impeccable timing.

But I also really fucking love super DIY hardcore punk. So I just love both things. It is hard to combine both things. It\u2019s just something I\u2019ve got to work on. I\u2019ve got to work on putting it in there.\u201d</p> <p>That \u201cit\u201d she refers to is punk and politics. It\u2019s something M\u00f8 is a little overwhelmed by at the moment, what with Brexit, Trump and the toxic re-emergence of the far right in her home country. But tackling those issues is tricky for her. Her music, muscular and melodic, is a hybrid of bouncy EDM drops and Scandipop on steroids. Her videos are often set in barren wastelands or deserts, as if to suggest an ambiguous global identity. Her lyrics are generally about coming together: unity, love and freedom. Then she adds a bit of angst. It\u2019s all very vague, at least when you compare it with the specific notion of putting one\u2019s pussy in another\u2019s face.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2016/oct/07/justin-bieber-jamie-t-mabel-kano-mo\">Five of the best... rock &amp; pop gigs</a> </p> </aside>  <p>This year has seen clear political statements on albums by Anohni, MIA, Beyonc\u00e9 and Solange, but M\u00f8 recognises that it is easier for established artists to release something with a hard-hitting, potentially divisive message. \u201cI have found it super hard: \u2018Oh, I don\u2019t want to upset anyone.\u2019 But now, when all these things are happening, you have to start doing something,\u201d she says.</p> <p>On the other hand, she has the expectations of her anarchic old friends to consider.

Her stage name means \u201cvirgin\u201d in Danish, and refers to her wide-eyed enthusiasm for the world, but is an example of how she subtly provokes from within the mainstream, too. Her second album is currently being written, and its leading track \u2013 the elephant-sized Final Song \u2013 became her biggest solo hit to date across Europe, Australia and New Zealand. Its video shows a polished version of the singer, unlike the one we were introduced to on her 2014 debut album, No Mythologies to Follow. Gone is the topknot and practical athleisure; in its place angelic blonde hair and a floral femininity.</p> <p>M\u00f8 says she is terrible at saying no; how much of her true self must she compromise for the sake of success? \u201cIn my heart, I want to believe I shouldn\u2019t give up anything to become a huge pop star. You have to dare to totally be yourself and go 100% with your heart and guts. And that\u2019s what I think sometimes can trick you, because people say: \u2018Oh, you should do this, you do that you should blah blah blah blah.\u2019 And, really, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s necessarily a better way. Trust your guts. Seriously \u2013 I know a lot of big pop stars have been made, I am aware of that, but I\u2019m not that kind of type. I mean I wouldn\u2019t have been the one they chose in an audition because I don\u2019t sing perfectly and I don\u2019t look particularly great.\u201d</p> <p>On stage, M\u00f8 is a tornado. Her dancing is uninhibited and wild, as if she were in the audience rather than centre-stage. She is fiercely present, never vacant or going through the motions. She almost always ends up crowdsurfing or in the pit.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s that urge to let something out. It is your place to express yourself and share it in the moment \u2013 and in a way it\u2019s the most nerve-racking thing in the world. But it can also be the most relieving thing because you\u2019re always [led by] control and schedule \u2013 which is great because I mean it\u2019s the dream life I\u2019m living, I\u2019m so happy \u2013 but there are a lot of things where you\u2019ve got to be controlled all the time.</p> <p>\u201cOnce I go on stage I can just fuck up. And I love that. I love to be free and don\u2019t think about if I look good or sing perfectly. It\u2019s just \u2018blaaaaagh!\u2019 It\u2019s so nice. Just watching that punk show \u2013 that was where I have it from. Just screaming and shouting and rolling on the floor. It\u2019s the most fucking great thing to do.

In October 2014, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hh9cbInp_Og\" title=\"\">they appeared on Saturday Night Live</a> to perform the track, but things didn\u2019t go to plan. M\u00f8 was awkward and, because of technical difficulties, out of time. She was a strange gothic ghost weaving in between a pristine pop machine. In its aftermath, the tabloids declared it \u201ca performance flub\u201d. She cried for three days and felt down for a week.</p> <p>\u201cMy attitude towards playing those big shows at the time? I was thinking: \u2018Yeah, I don\u2019t need to warm up for an hour.\u2019 I\u2019d always been like: \u2018I don\u2019t want to do a choreography. I\u2019m going to go in and be myself and it really doesn\u2019t matter.\u2019 But it didn\u2019t fit with their format and I was tapping into their thing,\u201d she says.</p> <p>\u201cIt was such a different world for me to suddenly stand there. I was sad that I didn\u2019t know how to be myself in that and make it work. But you make it work for yourself. There have been a couple of things during my career where I\u2019ve been looking back where I\u2019ve thought: I shouldn\u2019t have done that. But again, you learn from it and that\u2019s a blessing in a way. A big blessing. Because I\u2019m someone who needs to burn my hands to know.\u201d</p> <p>Her <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZyc6wIUOb4\" title=\"\">recent appearance on Jimmy Kimmel\u2019s show</a> suggests she has learned. The next challenge is finishing her upcoming album; an album that is surely weighted with the pressure to surpass the success of a Bieber-boosted hit and Lean On.</p> <p>\u201cI always dreamed about having a hit but I never thought it would happen so when it happened I was like: \u2018Huh? Can I really be a part of this? How the fuck is this even possible?\u2019 For the album, I want to have success but let\u2019s say my next album\u2019s going to fail. That will bring me something great again. It won\u2019t be putting water on the fire, it will just put gasoline on it. Because I\u2019ll be, like, fuck! I want to show them! Arrrrrgh! Which is a good thing. Of course I\u2019m scared \u2013 don\u2019t get me wrong \u2013 but it\u2019s fine.

Yet, when it comes to going to university, they are treated as overseas students - they cannot get a student loan, and can be charged international fees by universities, which are often two or three times the \u00a39,000 a year paid by other students.</p> <p>\u201cThere are very few other funding options available to young people in this situation.

To qualify for a government loan, students from migrant backgrounds must be able to prove that they have lived in the UK for at least half their life and that they have had \u201clawful ordinary residence\u201d for a minimum of three years. </p> <p>The only way to become \u201clawfully ordinarily resident\u201d is by being granted limited or indefinite leave to remain by the Home Office, which can be a long and complicated process. After that, they face a three-year wait before being eligible for a student loan and before automatically qualifying for home student fees. Many young people from migrant backgrounds and their families do not realise until it is too late.</p> <p>King\u2019s College London has already established two <a href=\"http://www.kcl.ac.uk/study/undergraduate/fees-and-funding/student-funding/scholarships-and-bursaries/scholarships/sanctuary-scholarship.aspx\">sanctuary scholarships </a>offering full tuition fee support and help with living costs to assist students who have sought sanctuary in the UK.

His reputation has long suffered by comparison with his contemporary and rival, Thomas Jefferson, who articulated an influential language of virtue; one which continues to inform America\u2019s self-image of butter-wouldn\u2019t-melt innocence.</p> <p>As Chernow notes: \u201cIf Jefferson provided the essential poetry of American political discourse, Hamilton established the prose of American statecraft.\u201d This is something for which he has received little thanks. Instead, \u201cthe proponent of such devilish contrivances as banks, factories and stock exchanges\u201d lurks in the recesses of the American memory as the distant godfather of what became Wall Street and the military-industrial complex.</p> <p>Notwithstanding its long afterlife, the caricature of the sinister un-American plotter successfully peddled in Jeffersonian propaganda is a travesty. Hamilton\u2019s problem, as Chernow perceives it, was not a sleekit propensity to conspire, but the opposite: an impulsive and reckless frankness that verged on \u201ca genius for the self-inflicted wound\u201d. Nor was Hamilton an innocuous victim of his opponents\u2019 slicker press management. While \u201ctouchy\u201d and sensitive about his own reputation, he was a master polemicist with a \u201cslashing style\u201d who turned out elegantly phrased, pugnacious copy by the yard. Indeed, it was his precocious skill as a writer that rescued the teenage Hamilton from a life that, at best, seemed to offer only penurious dependence, drudgery or worse.</p> <p>That Hamilton\u2019s beginnings were far from auspicious is something of an understatement. In his early family life in the West Indies he was \u201csurrounded by failed, broken, embittered people\u201d, who lived with the \u201cvertiginous\u201d anxieties of downwardly mobile whites. His mother Rachel Faucette was of French Huguenot stock and unhappily married on the Danish island of St Croix to a crushingly patriarchal Dane, Johann Michael Lavien, who had her imprisoned at one point in Fort Christiansvaern for adultery; his supposed father, James Hamilton, was the feckless younger son of a Scottish laird from Stevenston in Ayrshire. Hamilton was born on the island of Nevis, probably in 1755, and grew up in a cruel but cosmopolitan society. He was bilingual in French and English, thanks to his mother, and exposed both to race slavery \u2013 which he consistently deplored throughout his career \u2013 and to Jewish influences in Charlestown, where Jews made up a quarter of the white population.</p> <p>In 1765 the Hamiltons returned to the Anglo-Danish society of Christiansted in St Croix, but were soon deserted by Hamilton senior. Then, in quick succession, Hamilton\u2019s mother died, her estate was awarded to the legitimate son she had with Lavien, and a cousin, the guardian of the two boys she had with Hamilton senior, killed himself. Unsurprisingly, Hamilton was sensitive on questions of status \u2013 including illegitimacy \u2013 and reticent about his background. Chernow notes that what we now know of his childhood \u201chas been learned almost entirely during the past century\u201d.</p> <p>What transformed Hamilton\u2019s life was the influence of a merchant, Thomas Stevens \u2013 possibly, Chernow wonders, his actual biological father \u2013 and a bizarre literary windfall: a published essay that he wrote about the devastating hurricane of 1772 prompted some local men of substance to club together to fund his education in North America.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"a76996984e33b893bccf0cf08945e52dd8120daa\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a76996984e33b893bccf0cf08945e52dd8120daa/0_65_2900_3626/800.jpg\" alt=\"Alexander Hamilton (c1790).\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Alexander Hamilton (c1790).</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Stock Montage/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Hamilton went to King\u2019s College in New York \u2013 which later became Columbia University \u2013 in the early stages of the American revolution, an upheaval that ushered a further swift and dramatic change in circumstances. During the early stages of the war of independence, Hamilton\u2019s gifts of leadership, organisation and communication stood out, and the young man was soon elevated to a staff role in the revolutionary army, becoming George Washington\u2019s most trusted aide-de-camp in 1777 at the age of 22, and treasury secretary during his presidency.</p> <p>Victory against the British did not \u2013 as Hamilton recognised \u2013 solve America\u2019s problems. The Articles of Confederation among the newly independent states were simultaneously too loose and too cumbersome for effective governance; they were, in Chernow\u2019s words, \u201ca prescription for rigor mortis\u201d. Hamilton played a prominent part in the constitutional convention of 1787, and then, in alliance with the brilliant Virginian James Madison, later a bitter enemy, in the debates over whether to ratify the new constitution. Hamilton wrote 51 of the 85 essays collected as <em>The Federalist</em>, which appeared in a variety of outlets during the ratification debates in New York. All the while he was running a law practice, but still managed to write an incredible 21 essays in the two-month period after Madison left New York. He was gifted with a \u201cMozart-like\u201d facility for getting complex thoughts on to paper.</p> <p>Chernow\u2019s book serves as a reminder that the raw partisanship and personal hostility we see today in the Clinton-Trump contest is far from unprecedented. Contrary to legend, the Founding Fathers did not operate at a rarefied level removed from the grubby machinations of lesser hacks. While it\u2019s a sad descent from the genius of Jefferson, Madison and Hamilton to the fact-free bluster of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump\">Trump</a>, the Founders succumbed \u2013 especially during the alternating giddiness and anxiety of the 1790s \u2013 to vituperation and downright abuse. Hamilton, who was \u201cbrimming with libido\u201d and prone to flirtation, was the self-exposed victim of a political sex scandal. He was easily lured into an affair with Maria Reynolds, the wife of a swindler, and ended up revealing his own adultery to the world lest he be blamed for what he reckoned a worse sin, a lack of financial integrity.</p> <p>Alone among the leading Founding Fathers he perceived the necessity of learning from the fiscal-military statecraft of ancien regime Europe, Britain included: the world was as it was, not as Jefferson and other dreamy friends of the French Revolution wished it to be. Occasionally, however, hypocrisy has the best tunes, and during the 1790s Hamilton was blamed by high-minded Virginian slave owners \u2013 who posed as champions of democracy \u2013 for introducing speculative finance, central banks and the evils of capitalism to America\u2019s virtuous, agrarian Eden. Somehow the anti-capitalist mud flung by fashionably francophile slaveholders has stuck.</p> <p>Aaron Burr, a fellow New York politician, is an ironic presence throughout much of Chernow\u2019s book. Many readers will know that it was Burr who, when vice-president to Jefferson, killed Hamilton in a duel of honour in 1804. The ultimate cause was a press report on how Hamilton had slighted Burr at a dinner. Hamilton\u2019s son Philip had died a couple of years previously after being shot in a duel, and it remains unclear how much relish for life Hamilton retained by the time of his death. Notwithstanding the hurt of the Reynolds affair, his widow Eliza, who lived for a further 50 years, continued to cherish his memory, gathering his papers and agitating for a monumental biography. Hamilton now has his monument, and, with the stunning success of the musical, we are witnessing a reversal of reputational fortune.</p> <p>\u2022 <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/alexander-hamilton-462478.html?utm_source=editoriallink&amp;utm_medium=merch&amp;utm_campaign=article\"><em>Alexander Hamilton</em></a> is published by Head of Zeus.

  "<p>After a new analysis found <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/12/austin-texas-police-use-force-race-black-hispanic\">clear racial disparities</a> in the Austin police department\u2019s use of force across different neighborhoods, the police chief in the Texas city is pledging to continue the department\u2019s training programs on implicit and explicit racial bias.<br></p> <p>The <a href=\"http://policingequity.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Austin_PDI_Report_2016_Release.pdf\">analysis</a>, which looks at racial disparities after controlling for crime rates and income and education levels, is designed to be easily adaptable to other cities. Guardian US spoke to police chief Art Acevedo about the new findings, why he\u2019s making them public, and why he hopes other cities will follow Austin\u2019s example. The conversation has been edited for length and clarity.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/12/austin-texas-police-use-force-race-black-hispanic\">Austin police use force more often in black and Hispanic areas, study finds</a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong>Guardian US: </strong><strong>What made you feel willing and interested in having this data analyzed and looked at \u2013 knowing it would open the department up to criticism? </strong></p> <p><strong>Acevedo: </strong>First and foremost, as an organization, we\u2019re committed to the concept of procedural justice. We\u2019re also sophisticated enough to realize that as much as we are always pursuing excellence, that we\u2019re an imperfect organization, as is the human condition. We\u2019re committed to transparency and we\u2019re committed to any process that will help us identify areas where we can do better. </p> <p><strong>You\u2019ve seen the report. What do you make of it? </strong><strong> </strong></p> <p>My reaction is, we are doing a lot of things really well, including demonstrating to our community our commitment to transparency and our commitment to always trying to do better. </p> <p>In terms of how we\u2019re policing and who we\u2019re searching, we\u2019re doing a heck of a job of identifying folks involved with criminal behavior and criminal conduct, and our methodology in terms of the way we search people, when we search people, are probably looking pretty good. When you look at our hit ratio, it\u2019s one of the highest in the nation. We have one of the most restrictive consent search policies in the nation. What that does is it makes police officers actually do police work, and rely on probable cause. </p> <p>We don\u2019t subscribe to the notion that just because somebody lives in an area that is disproportionately affected by violent crime or any type of crime that people should be treated any differently. When a person gets stopped for the 10th time in these communities where they subscribe to the notion of stop and frisk \u2013 stop anything that moves, and frisk everybody in that drag net \u2013 by the 10th time that you\u2019re stopped, you end up creating a lot of problems in terms of legitimacy. </p> <p>The part that obviously we read in there in terms of some disproportionality in use of force, is something that we are somewhat aware of. </p> <p>We\u2019re a department also that takes use of force, response to resistance, very seriously. I think what it tells me is that we still have more work to do. We have to continue to work in terms of our training on implicit and explicit bias for our department. Dr Lorie Fridell is here this month from Florida, to be providing more training in that area. </p> <p><strong>How will you explain to your officers what this report found, and why you decided to go public with it, and what you\u2019re going to do about it? </strong></p> <p>My cops will not be surprised by the fact that we\u2019re participating in this. They know that this is a journey. We will talk to them about the fact that there is a use of force disparity and our next step for us is that we continue to evaluate our training in terms of de-escalation. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Part of the problem of bias is that too often we don\u2019t create a safe space for people to talk about their feelings</p> <footer> <cite>Art Acevedo</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Part of the problem of bias is that too often we don\u2019t create a safe space for people to be able to talk about their feelings. By having these trainings that we\u2019re having, we\u2019re hoping to create some safe spaces for people to be able to openly talk about their perceptions and their feelings and their experiences. Self-awareness goes a long way, so they can maybe have that second thought in their mind to evaluate: \u201cAm I acting because I have to, or am I acting because of a bias?\u201d </p> <p>Everybody needs to do their own self-assessment and make sure they\u2019re using force not because they can, but because they completely, absolutely need to. Making sure they\u2019re treating people through the prism of a suspect\u2019s action and not through the prism of race or the prism of ethnicity or what part of the city I\u2019m patrolling in. </p> <p>We are going to talk to our officers that our belief and the community\u2019s belief that the very vast majority of them continue to do the right thing for the right reasons. </p> <p>We\u2019ll also talk to them about our commitment to continue to work with the community in terms of building relationships of trust. One of the causes of response to resistance issues is when there\u2019s a challenge with trust, and right now there\u2019s a challenge with trust nationwide. </p> <p><strong>Do you think other departments will follow your lead here? How would you talk to chiefs or mayors in other cities about the risks and benefits of doing this? </strong></p> <p>Listen, you can be an ostrich as a leader, and bury your head in the sand, or you can be forward-thinking and be scanning the environment constantly for threats or for opportunities to do better. </p> <p>I would rather always be transparent. I really think that people are smart. I think that most Austinites that you talk to, including our communities of color, know that although we\u2019re not a perfect organization, they know that on balance we\u2019re a pretty damn good organization. They know and they trust that we\u2019re always trying to do the right thing. We are looking forward to setting the tone for the rest of the nation. </p> <p>The problem being the only department that does it, there\u2019s no other points of reference. How do we stack up? </p> <p>With 18,000 police departments, I really believe that we\u2019re only as good as the weakest department in the nation. We\u2019re all a reflection of one another. When things go sideways, it impacts police departments and relationships, it has an impact nationwide. </p> <p>It seems that almost weekly we have a use of force incident captured on camera that goes viral. People don\u2019t know where one jurisdiction ends and another begins. And I think the standing of the profession is probably being challenged more than ever in the history of our policing in this nation, and the professionalism of this noble profession and the commitment to legitimacy is being questioned like it\u2019s never been questioned. </p> <p>I\u2019m starting to hear folks say: \u201cWell, even when we do everything that\u2019s required of us, we might end up getting killed by the police,\u201d and that\u2019s a challenge because when people have that mindset, I think it creates more potential for people not to submit to the lawful authority of law enforcement officers. </p> <p>We don\u2019t just need to be data-driven, we also need to be relationship-driven. </p> <p>The more departments that do these things \u2013 the more departments that collect data, that actually are committed to transparency \u2013 when communities see the profession willing to be committed to transparency, the community knows that\u2019s the first step to building legitimacy. </p> <p>When you look at what\u2019s going on with government, mistrust of government in our nation\u2019s history is a historic high. The most visible cog of the wheel we call government is law enforcement. It\u2019s police departments. We\u2019re paying the cost of not just our own actions, but we\u2019re paying the cost, as a profession, of the mistrust of government in general. </p> <p><strong>What kind of response do you expect from community groups in Austin? </strong></p> <p>We make all our data publicly available every year. They know there\u2019s some disparities there in terms of use of force. What we continue to work on as a community is, how do we manage that? </p> <p>We\u2019ve had, over the years, a couple of really challenging use of deadly force encounters. What\u2019s happened around the country hasn\u2019t happened here in terms of some of the violence in response to these use of force encounters. We spend a lot of time building emotional capital with the community that we serve, working with Black Lives Matter, working with the Austin Justice Coalition, working with Measure Austin \u2013 these are all young activists here in our city. </p> <p>All of those things that we do help us overcome issues when we\u2019re not quite to where we want to be, or when we have an incident where we fall short.</p>",

The government has now agreed to conduct one but the results will not be known until at least 2019. But a survey in Gujarat, one of the richest Indian states, established a far higher prevalence of TB than had been thought and together with other evidence, it has been possible to come up with a better estimate than in previous years.</p> <p>Work has been going on to encourage doctors in the private sector to report TB cases, which they are not obliged to do and have not done in the past. In the slums of Mumbai, Ayurvedic doctors and healers who see most of the patients have been encouraged to give out the free antibiotics to treat TB alongside traditional remedies, and to report the numbers of patients they see. A digital reporting system has been introduced with some success.</p> <p>India wins praise from WHO but its actions have served to highlight the scale of the problem. Of the 10.4m cases worldwide, only 6.1m were detected and treated in 2015. Those undetected risk passing the bacteria that causes TB to their families. Countries do not have the rapid testing equipment they need.</p> <p>There is particular concern over drug-resistant TB, which affects 580,000 people.

Sure, it played an important role in the Arab spring and other popular movements (though that role has often been exaggerated), but it surprises me the extent to which the mainstream media still dominates political discourse. What will it take to change this? As Chris Bogle, below, points out, we are so busy and so wrapped up in the immediate daily demands of our lives that it is hard to put in the kind of time and resources that the professional media is able to deploy. So is the dream of political change through technology a false one? I don't know the answer to that, but I would be interested in your opinions.</p></div> </div> </div>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57ff84a4e4b047a4eaafc170\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/sarah-marsh\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-13T12:57:41.567Z\">1.57pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>George defines neoliberalism for those who are unsure of its exact meaning:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-comment\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/live/2016/oct/13/is-neoliberalism-creating-loneliness-in-our-society-ask-george-monbiot#comment-85337715\">  <div class=\"d2-comment-embedded\" itemscope itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Comment\"> <div class=\"d2-left-col\"> <a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/1395989\" title=\"View GeorgeMonbiot\u2019s profile\"> <img class=\"d2-avatar\" src=\"https://avatar.guim.co.uk/user/1395989\" height=\"40\" width=\"40\" alt=\"User avatar for GeorgeMonbiot\"> </a> <span class=\"d2-badge d2-badge-contributor d2-hidetext\" title=\"Guardian contributor\" itemprop=\"jobTitle\">Guardian contributor</span> </div> <div class=\"d2-right-col\"> <div itemscope itemprop=\"author\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\"> <a class=\"d2-username\" href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/1395989\" title=\"View GeorgeMonbiot\u2019s profile\" itemprop=\"url\"> <span itemprop=\"givenName\">GeorgeMonbiot</span> </a> </div> <div class=\"d2-permalink\"> <a class=\"d2-datetime\" href=\"https://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/85337715\" title=\"Link to this comment\" itemprop=\"datePublished\">13 October 2016 1:54pm</a> </div> <div class=\"d2-body\" itemprop=\"text\"><p>I <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/apr/15/neoliberalism-ideology-problem-george-monbiot\" rel=\"nofollow\">define it here</a> as follows:</p> <p>Neoliberalism sees competition as the defining characteristic of human relations.

The organisation of labour and collective bargaining by trade unions are portrayed as market distortions that impede the formation of a natural hierarchy of winners and losers.

By which I mean, we seem to have a deep rooted and ugly mentality in our (western industrial) society, where people on lower incomes are ostracised because of their financial modesty. I believe this is a direct result of the competitive, money motivated basis of the neoliberal/capitalist society, and has resulted in the marginalisation of those without means. </p> <p>It is a fact that wherever you go/whatever you do, in the UK especially, it costs you money. Even a walk in the park will often incur parking fees. Whereas conversely (and somewhat perversely), a shopping centre will often offer free parking, making it an ideal place to while away the hours, where you are then bombarded with imagery/advertising reminding you how terrible your life is, and how much better it would be if you bought more stuff.</p> <p>So I think my question is, if our toxic money/consumer mad culture is directly responsible for the loneliness/isolation epidemic, can we start by rejecting consumerism and its rudimentary pigeonholing of the haves and have not's. Can we start looking at ways to value people outside of what they own/earn, as a way to re-connect people?</p></div> </div> </div>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57ff7e0fe4b016012389560e\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/sarah-marsh\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-13T12:30:04.099Z\">1.30pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Can we link neoliberalism to Brexit?</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>One question from one of our readers raises interesting questions.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-comment\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/live/2016/oct/13/is-neoliberalism-creating-loneliness-in-our-society-ask-george-monbiot#comment-85327685\">  <div class=\"d2-comment-embedded\" itemscope itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Comment\"> <div class=\"d2-left-col\"> <a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/4135628\" title=\"View carbonfiend\u2019s profile\"> <img class=\"d2-avatar\" src=\"https://avatar.guim.co.uk/user/4135628\" height=\"40\" width=\"40\" alt=\"User avatar for carbonfiend\"> </a> </div> <div class=\"d2-right-col\"> <div itemscope itemprop=\"author\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\"> <a class=\"d2-username\" href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/4135628\" title=\"View carbonfiend\u2019s profile\" itemprop=\"url\"> <span itemprop=\"givenName\">carbonfiend</span> </a> </div> <div class=\"d2-permalink\"> <a class=\"d2-datetime\" href=\"https://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/85327685\" title=\"Link to this comment\" itemprop=\"datePublished\">13 October 2016 12:27pm</a> </div> <div class=\"d2-body\" itemprop=\"text\"><p>Can we link neoliberalism to why whole communites voted for Brexit ?

Our society has developed a vocabulary and style of language use quite different to previous cultures. This style of language use appears to have developed after powerful rulers took over our societies with the first civilizations, and this vocabulary and language style was developed to facilitate their control of our societies. I've since found that this is not a new idea, and if you see this video by Marshall Rosenberg who founded the concept of Non-violent Communication NVC, you will see he makes similar points.<br /><a href=\"https://youtu.be/-dpk5Z7GIFs\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://youtu.be/-dpk5Z7GIFs</a></p> <p>I believe the reason for the failur of social progress, and the transition to a sustainable economy has failed is because our language style and use is actually designed to perpetuate the status quo. The most fundamental task of the early powerful rulers of our society, and all hierarchical societies ever since, has been to stop people overthrowing them. To do this it was necessary to detach people from the natural environment and their fellow people, to stop them caring so much about what was happening.</p> <p>Without going into great detail, I believe our language style and use creates deliberate detachment. Detachment from our own feelings and emotions, detachment from other people and detachment from the natural world. In our culture's language style the most important referent is an idea, a definition of the word, not the thing, the actual phenomenon refers to. By having abstract ideas as the primary referent of words and terms, it leads to detachment and a \u201cblindness of abstraction\u201d. We feel detached when thinking about an abstract idea, and what the words or terms refer to are not immediate and deeply felt. In particular it leads to a major logical error, where the person \u201cmistakes the map for the territory\u201d i.e. the word and idea becomes more real to them, than the actual phenomena the words, terms or ideas refers to.<br /><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Map%E2%80%93territory_relation\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Map%E2%80%93territory_relation</a></p> <p>What I am saying is that to solve the problem, we need to understand how the language use and style our culture has developed, detaches from other people, and the natural world, and makes us highly completive, and allows us to ignore the consequences. What do you think of this? I realise it is a bit complex for a Q&amp;A, and this is something for you to consider.</p> <p>Just to clarify this I am saying that this vocabulary and language use developed over time after the rise of the first civilizations, essentially controls how people perceive the world around them, and how they think about it. It need not be like this if the map-territory relationship was far more widely understood, and everyone was to understand why the map is never the territory.</p></div> </div> </div>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57ff78ace4b01ffb8ffcb462\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/sarah-marsh\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-13T12:07:23.580Z\">1.07pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Loneliness and consumerism</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>George has started responding below the line, with this question triggering some interesting debate:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-comment\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/live/2016/oct/13/is-neoliberalism-creating-loneliness-in-our-society-ask-george-monbiot#comment-85323882\">  <div class=\"d2-comment-embedded\" itemscope itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Comment\"> <div class=\"d2-left-col\"> <a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/12782799\" title=\"View LionelKent\u2019s profile\"> <img class=\"d2-avatar\" src=\"https://avatar.guim.co.uk/user/12782799\" height=\"40\" width=\"40\" alt=\"User avatar for LionelKent\"> </a> </div> <div class=\"d2-right-col\"> <div itemscope itemprop=\"author\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\"> <a class=\"d2-username\" href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/12782799\" title=\"View LionelKent\u2019s profile\" itemprop=\"url\"> <span itemprop=\"givenName\">LionelKent</span> </a> </div> <div class=\"d2-permalink\"> <a class=\"d2-datetime\" href=\"https://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/85323882\" title=\"Link to this comment\" itemprop=\"datePublished\">13 October 2016 11:55am</a> </div> <div class=\"d2-body\" itemprop=\"text\"><p>George, I believe that with few exceptions, if any, a neoliberal politician will endorse consumerism and the force behind it, i.e. the constant, ubiquitous, and frenetic generation of artificial demand.

I do believe that consumerism plays an important role, as it is one of the factors that drives competition and a sense of social threat.

Hence the term retail therapy.</p> <p>But it extends far beyond the purchase of staff, significant as this is. I believe that the ethic of consumerism now infects away we view ourselves and present our self-image to the world.

  "<p>Twenty-one schoolgirls abducted by Islamic militants in Nigeria two years ago have been freed, officials in the west African country have said.</p> <p>The news will raise hopes that more of the 276 schoolgirls, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/may/15/chibok-nigeria-200-kidnapped-schoolgirls-boko-haram\">taken from their hostel in a government boarding school in the town of Chibok</a> by Boko Haram in April 2014, will be released.</p> <p>The kidnapping of the girls led to the global campaign <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/voluntary-sector-network/2014/may/09/bringbackourgirls-power-of-social-media\">#BringBackOurGirls</a>, with public figures including the US first lady, Michelle Obama, calling for their release.</p> <p>Few details have emerged of the ordeal of the abducted girls, many of whom are believed to have been taken as wives and systematically raped. Others have reportedly been forced to carry out demanding physical tasks.</p> <p>About 190 girls from Chibok are still being held by the militants. Fifty-seven fled within hours of being captured. In May, <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/19/nigerian-president-meet-chibok-schoolgirl-escaped-boko-haram\">one girl was found and rescued</a> in an area close to Boko Haram strongholds.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f41fabfc23ace9437cdd5d5215298afa86b3fe9d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f41fabfc23ace9437cdd5d5215298afa86b3fe9d/94_195_2934_1761/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Amina Ali Darsha Nkeki, rescued from Boko Haram in May, presents her child to President Muhammadu Buhari in Abuja.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Amina Ali Darsha Nkeki, rescued from Boko Haram in May, presents her child to President Muhammadu Buhari in Abuja.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Afolabi Sotunde/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Garba Shehu, a spokesman for President Muhammadu Buhari, confirmed that 21 of the released girls were in the custody of the state services department. Local media reported that Boko Haram had dropped the girls at a location from where the military picked them up.</p> <p>\u201cThe release of the girls, in a limited number, is the outcome of negotiations between the administration and Boko Haram brokered by the International Red Cross and the Swiss government. The negotiations will continue,\u201d Shehu said.</p> <p>\u201cThe president welcomes the release of the girls but cautioned Nigerians to be mindful of the fact that more than 30,000 fellow citizens were killed via terrorism.\u201d</p> <p>Another official said the released girls were tired.</p> <p>Four Boko Haram prisoners were swapped for the girls, defence officials confirmed, adding that they expected more girls to be released in the near future.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re not authorised to release the details of how the girls were retrieved yet but the operation to retrieve the girls is ongoing. We are optimistic we will retrieve more of the Chibok girls from Boko Haram very soon, in the coming weeks,\u201d Gen Rabe Abubakar, a defence ministry spokesman, said. </p> <p>When Buhari <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/mar/31/opposition-candidate-muhammadu-buhari-wins-nigerian-election\">took power in May 2015</a>, he vowed to crush Boko Haram within a year. While government forces have taken back large amounts of territory from the group, it has remained active, killing hundreds of people in suicide bombings.</p> <p>The #BringBackOurGirls campaign group said Thursday\u2019s release was a \u201cwonderful development\u201d that confirmed \u201cwhat we have always known about the capacity of our government to rescue our #ChibokGirls\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cFollowing this development, we trust that our government will continue to work to keep the safety, security, and wellbeing of the other girls a high priority,\u201d it said in a statement. \u201cWe further urge the international community to continue to support our government\u2019s effort to rescue all other abducted Nigerians, so that parents, the Chibok community, the nation and the world can finally put an end to this nightmare once and for all.\u201d</p> <p>The Chibok girls are among thousands of adults and children who have been abducted by Boko Haram during its seven-year insurgency. The group is short of manpower and has turned to abductions as recruitment has slowed.<br></p> <p>Negotiations with Nigerian government representatives for the release of the schoolgirls have been complicated by splits within Boko Haram. The movement has fractured into two, possibly three factions <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2016/oct/06/isis-al-qaida-turf-wars-africa-may-push-fragile-states-to-breaking-point\">over the issue of links with Islamic State</a>.</p> <p>Isis, of which the Nigerian group is still theoretically an affiliate, announced last month that Abu Musab al-Barnawi was Boko Haram\u2019s new leader, replacing the erratic Abubakar Shekau. The decision may have been prompted by Shekau\u2019s use of female suicide bombers and targeting of Muslims.</p> <p>A suicide bomber in Maiduguri, the capital of Borno State and birthplace of Boko Haram, <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-nigeria-security-idUSKCN12C0XM\">killed eight people on Wednesday</a>.</p> <p>British and US special forces have been assisting the Nigerian military in their campaign against Boko Haram. Support from soldiers in the neighbouring countries of Niger, Cameroon and Chad was critical in pushing back the extremists, experts said.</p> <p>Shekau has continued to claim to be in control of the group. A video released of the Chibok girls in August seemed to have come from his camp somewhere in the sprawling Sambisa forest, in Borno. It showed about 50 of the girls and included a demand for the release of imprisoned militants in exchange for them.</p> <p>The previous government, under Goodluck Jonathan, conducted high-level negotiations before realising it was talking to impostors.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/18/chibok-abducted-girls-women-north-east-nigeria-boko-haram-video\">The Chibok girls are just one part of the ordeal of women in north-east Nigeria | Chitra Nagarajan</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Buhari\u2019s government was previously thought to be attempting to rescue the girls. The army had launched airstrikes on Boko Haram strongholds and claimed to have wounded or even killed Shekau. The extremist leader subsequently appeared, apparently unhurt, in a video.<br></p> <p>Abubakar said on Thursday: \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter whether he is dead or alive, the main thing is the group is being defeated. </p> <p>\u201cThe Boko Haram of today is not the one of years ago. They can only bomb locations now because they hold no territory and we are defeating them at each stage. The government is negotiating with Boko Haram, including prisoner swaps, but at the same time we the military are degrading them where we can. That is proving an effective way of defeating this group.\u201d </p> <p>Elizabeth Donnelly, an expert at London\u2019s Chatham House, said the release suggested \u201ca potential opening with the insurgents\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThere is still a question of why only this number [of girls has been released] but it shows that negotiations are possible and that is really important in trying to shift the nature of the conflict,\u201d Donnelly said.<strong> </strong></p> <p>In the past year, the Nigerian army has retaken towns and villages in the north-east controlled by Boko Haram, and has freed hundreds of women and children held captive. However, many survivors face rejection or are stigmatised when they return to their families or are settled in refugee camps.</p> <p>In many areas of northern Nigeria, millions of victims of malnutrition, neglect and in some cases famine are surfacing, threatening a vast humanitarian crisis. Aid workers say hundreds of thousands of children are chronically malnourished.</p>",
  "<p>Maricela Flores, a 43-year-old immigrant from Mexico, was so unhappy at her job as a janitor at a Target store just outside Minneapolis \u2013 unhappy about having to work seven days a week, about being paid $8 an hour, about not having health coverage or paid sick days \u2013 that she did something unusually risky. She went on strike even though she was not part of a labor union.</p> <p> When Flores, a mother of five, walked out in February 2013, she was one of just eight janitors from stores in the Twin Cities to go on strike that day to demand better conditions. Flores was relieved not to get fired.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/02/massachusetts-equal-pay-law-women-salary-history\">Massachusetts to adopt equal pay law to break pattern of unfair pay for women</a> </p> </aside>  <p> Now, 44 months later and after a highly unorthodox organizing drive that included six more one-day strikes, Flores and other janitors who clean Target, Macy\u2019s and Best Buy stores in the Twin Cities are declaring victory. On Thursday, they will announce that 600 janitors have won union recognition and will soon start collective bargaining in the hope of winning higher pay, health coverage and other improvements. </p> <p> \u201cI could have done nothing, but I chose to fight,\u201d Flores said. \u201cThis has been a long fight, but now I feel overjoyed. All the hard work has paid off.\u201d </p> <p> Flores hopes that her new union, Local 26 of the Service Employees International Union, will bring important gains when it bargains with the retailers\u2019 cleaning contractors. \u201cWe want fair work scheduling, health insurance, higher wages,\u201d Flores said in Spanish. \u201cAll these things would allow me to be more involved in the daily lives of my children and to have a better quality of life.\u201d</p> <p> This fight began seven years ago when an immigrant workers\u2019 center in Minneapolis \u2013 Centro Trabajadores Unidos en Lucha (United Workers Center in Struggle) \u2013 contacted janitors at retail stores in the Twin Cities area. That workers\u2019 center, known as CTUL, formed an organizing committee, led a three-mile protest march, held a 12-day hunger strike and sponsored a series of steadily expanding one-day strikes, which aimed to pressure retail powerhouses such as Target and Best Buy, both based in the Twin Cities, to give the janitors a voice at work.</p> <p> The effort grew more ambitious, with its focus turning towards getting Target to adopt a Responsible Contractor Policy. Target adopted such a policy in 2014, requiring its contractors to comply with labor and wage laws, and the janitors\u2019 focus then changed to forming a labor union, convinced that this was the best way to win better conditions. </p> <p>Labor experts say this is probably the most successful effort to unionize retail store janitors in the US. \u201cThe retail janitorial industry has been overwhelmingly non-union \u2013 it was viewed by most people as \u2018unorganizable\u2019,\u201d said Stephen Lerner, the former head of the SEIU\u2019s Justice for Janitors Campaign, which unionized tens of thousands of office building janitors nationwide.</p> <p>Javier Morillo, the president of Local 26, noted a disconnect in the way Target\u2019s janitors are treated. A unionized janitor \u201cwho cleans Target\u2019s corporate headquarters makes over $15 an hour and has health benefits\u201d, he said. \u201cBut if you clean inside a store, you make close to the minimum wage and have no health coverage or other benefits. It\u2019s strange. It\u2019s the same work.\u201d</p> <p>The campaign faced some major hurdles, among them that few janitors spoke English; that they were from many countries, from El Salvador to Somalia; and that many were undocumented. Veronica Mendez Moore, CTUL\u2019s co-director, said the effort faced two other big obstacles: employee isolation and the complex structure of the industry.<strong><br></strong></p> <p>Her group sought to contact janitors at 300 stores in the Twin Cities area, with many stores having just one or two janitors, who often worked after midnight. </p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a complicated industry structure with all these retailers and contractors so it was hard to figure out strategy,\u201d Mendez said. \u201cAnd these workers felt very isolated. It\u2019s hard for them to feel there are other workers standing up with them. We did a lot of work to find ways to connect workers.\u201d Organizers arranged conference calls that connected dozens of janitors, who for the first time could hear other janitors speaking out. Often, individual organizers drove to stores after midnight and used their mobile phones to connect one or two janitors to a conference call.</p> <p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t seem revolutionary, but workers haven\u2019t done anything like this,\u201d Mendez said. \u201cIt was very intense to connect workers this way. They\u2019re scattered all over the suburbs.\u201d</p> <p>The increasingly connected janitors grew more emboldened, holding several protests outside Target stores in Minneapolis. For Target these strikes became a headache. After the second strike, Target executives sat down with several CTUL leaders and janitors. Ultimately Target agreed to a Responsible Contractor Policy, which requires contractors not to break the law in fighting against unionization. The janitors also protested at a Best Buy shareholders meeting, helping to persuade that company to hire a new cleaning contractor that CTUL viewed as \u201cresponsible\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThese strikes really helped, they really pressured the companies to do the right thing,\u201d said Pascual Tapia, a janitor at a Target in downtown Minneapolis. He told of a cleaning contractor who cheated him and his coworkers out of overtime by forcing them \u2013 when working more than 40 hours a week \u2013 to punch in under the name of a \u201cghost\u201d employee.</p> <p> CTUL and the janitors brought several lawsuits against such wage theft, winning settlements that totaled more than $1m in back pay and damages. As a result of the campaign, the area\u2019s retailers jettisoned some law-breaking contractors and hired better ones to replace them, helping to shrink the number of major contractors to four, from 20. </p> <p> The janitors are winning recognition from three cleaning contractors: IFS, Carlson Building Maintenance and Prestige Maintenance. The companies agreed to begin bargaining under a trigger mechanism \u2013 only once the janitors gained recognition from contractors that clean 60% of the area\u2019s roughly 300 big box stores. Officials from IFS, Carlson and Prestige did not respond to phone messages. </p> <p> \u201cThe trigger means the contractors aren\u2019t sticking out their necks too much,\u201d Mendez said. In other words, they won\u2019t have to increase costs because of a union agreement unless their competitors are doing the same thing. </p> <p> Molly Snyder, a Target spokeswoman, said the retailer has a \u201cstrong commitment to maintaining high standards\u201d for its cleaners and encouraged its contractors and CTUL \u201cto have an honest and open dialogue that is focused on finding mutually agreement solutions\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cWe are very pleased by the progress that our vendors have made in that effort,\u201d she said.</p> <p> The Twin Cities campaign is unusual in that a workers\u2019 center has worked so closely with a labor union. Morillo, Local 26\u2019s president, noted that some labor leaders criticize worker centers for doing little to unionize workers.</p> <p> \u201cThe importance of this is that five years ago, this market looked unorganizable, in the way that many low-wage and contingent workers seem unorganizable for traditional collective bargaining,\u201d Morillo said. \u201cThat\u2019s the big innovation here.\u201d </p> <p> Mendez said worker centers in other cities have called CTUL for advice on how they, too, can mobilize and organize retail janitors. </p> <p> \u201cA lot has changed for us,\u201d said Maricela Flores, the janitor. \u201cThat first day I went on strike I was very afraid, afraid of getting fired. But I had to fight to change things to have a better life for me and my family. I was willing to take the risk to bring changes.\u201d</p>",

I think it is extremely important that we continue to send out a signal of openness and welcome to the many brilliant people who help to drive the London economy and the UK economy.\u201d </p> <p>Brexit means \u201crestoring our democracy and control of our borders and our lives and a fair bit of cash\u201d, said the foreign secretary. \u201cBut Brexit is not any sort of mandate for this country to turn in on itself and haul up the drawbridge or to detach itself from the international community.\u201d</p> <p>Johnson said he thought Britain had done \u201cthe right thing\u201d in voting to leave the EU on 23 June. He told the committee: \u201cI think those who prophesied doom before the referendum have been proved wrong and I think they will continue to be proved wrong.\u201d</p> <p> He added there would be some \u201c<em>Sturm und Drang</em> on the way ... Obviously it will take time before the full benefits of Brexit appear.\u201d</p>",

It may also weaken Sturgeon\u2019s hand in future Brexit talks: negotiations are due to start in late October, when the prime minister meets Sturgeon and the leaders of the Welsh and Northern Irish governments to agree on joint plans to prepare for Brexit.</p> <p>\u201cThere are serious contradictions\u201d in Sturgeon\u2019s two-pronged strategy, the Cabinet source said. It was also premature to threaten a second vote: the UK would be seeking a unique deal with the EU which could meet many of Sturgeon\u2019s conditions, he said. <br></p> <p>But Sturgeon\u2019s advisers say that speeding up the referendum bill process highlights an increasingly significant political divide between the Scottish and UK governments, showing Sturgeon\u2019s increasing confidence that the Tory shift to a harder line on Brexit has strengthened her hand.</p> <p>Sturgeon faces substantial obstacles to staging a second independence vote before the UK leaves the EU in March 2019. Scottish voters are still not convinced of the case for a fast second referendum, and Holyrood requires Westminster\u2019s legal authority to stage one.</p> <p>The latest poll, by BMG, published on Thursday by the Herald, found that there is no popular majority in favour of a second referendum. It found that only 12% of those voters who do not want independence would switch to support leaving the UK if there were a hard Brexit. It found 47% were against a new independence vote, 38% in favour and 12% undecided.</p> <p>The economics of Scottish independence are still extremely difficult: the latest GDP data showed Scotland\u2019s economy still growing at a third of the pace of the UK\u2019s as a whole, and government data showed a \u00a315bn Scottish spending deficit last year \u2013 21% of all government spending in Scotland.</p> <p>Opposition leaders said Sturgeon could have offered a far more constructive vision for reform of Scottish domestic policies but instead had increased the divisions and conflicts with the rest of the UK.</p> <p>Sturgeon made clear that she planned to set out new policies in her main conference address on Saturday, but Ruth Davidson, the Scottish Tory leader, responded: \u201cHer comments show she has given up on speaking for Scotland and is now solely playing to the SNP gallery.

However, Murray said it was extremely risky for Sturgeon to discuss staging a second referendum before the UK\u2019s Brexit deal was agreed.</p> <p>\u201cNobody quite knows what Brexit means, and to have a discussion on a second independence referendum is a dereliction of duty,\u201d Murray said. \u201cThe country is completely divided [by Brexit]. We don\u2019t need to see any more division layered on top of that.\u201d </p> <p>Kezia Dugdale, the Scottish Labour leader, said: \u201cNicola Sturgeon\u2019s top priority is to divide our nation once again. But our country is already divided following the Tories\u2019 reckless Brexit gamble and we should not be seeking further divisions. Our economy is in trouble, and the last thing we need is the uncertainty of another independence referendum.\u201d</p> <p>Responding to Sturgeon\u2019s speech, Downing Street said the government would continue to engage with Sturgeon and the people of Scotland but would not support another referendum. \u201cWe believe this issue was addressed in 2014.

  "<p>A Somali-born man who spurned MI5 efforts to recruit him as an informant has been found guilty \u2013 following a partially secret trial \u2013 of preparing to join Islamic State fighters in Syria.</p> <p>Anas Abdalla was discovered hiding behind canisters in the back of a lorry in Dover as he tried to smuggle himself out of the UK in April 2015. He claimed he was escaping from years of harassment by anti-terrorism officers. His final movements had been closely tracked by an undercover \u201claw enforcement\u201d agent.</p> <p>It is the fourth time the former computer technology student, who holds British citizenship, has been put on trial for the same terrorist offence at the Old Bailey on London. He was convicted after the prosecution shifted from its previous position of neither confirming nor denying (NCND) Abdalla\u2019s allegations of \u201coppressive treatment\u201d by the security service.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/sep/14/old-bailey-jury-to-hear-secret-evidence-from-counter-terrorism-officer\">Old Bailey jury to hear secret evidence from counter-terrorism officer</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In order to contest details of Abdalla\u2019s dealings with MI5, evidence was given in secret by counter-terrorism officers. The media and the public were excluded from court 10 at the Old Bailey during the in camera sessions \u2013 one of a handful of occasions this has happened in a criminal court in England and Wales. The jury, Abdalla and his lawyers remained. </p> <p>The court order authorising the procedure stated that the closed hearing would cover \u201cany evidence which is called by the prosecution which confirms or denies any allegation of contact, or attempted contact, between MI5 and [Abdalla]\u201d, as well as \u201cany allegation ... that [Abdalla] would not be allowed by MI5 to live and progress normal expectations and achievements in life\u201d. </p> <p>As a result, it is not possible to report on all the evidence the prosecution had offered against Abdalla.</p> <p>For a former asylum-seeker to smuggle himself out of the UK is highly unusual. For the Crown Prosecution Service to present MI5-related evidence behind locked, courtroom doors is, however, becoming more common. It was used in the <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2015/mar/26/erol-incedal-case-secret-trial-terror\">Erol Incedal trial last year</a>.</p> <p>The legal means used to try to secure a conviction are now provoking concern about a lack of open justice and the way in which the media are restricted in reporting terrorism trials.</p> <p>In a judgment on whether the case could be heard in secret, which can now be reported, the judge, Richard Marks QC, said he considered the general problem in such cases. \u201cThe knowledge that having cooperated with a state agency, a witness from that agency had given chapter and verse in open court about the dealings they had had, would, in my judgment, be highly likely to act as a serious disincentive to others who might otherwise be contemplating rendering assistance.\u201d</p> <p>Abdalla hung his head as the jury found him guilty by a majority of 11 to one after deliberating for 19 hours and 30 minutes. He was remanded in custody to be sentenced at a later date. <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>As he was being remanded Abdalla threw a plastic cup at a counter-terrorism officer and said: \u201cOne day we will be standing in a bigger court than this.\u201d </p> <p>Abdalla, 26, was born in Mogadishu, the capital of Somalia, in February 1989. He eventually settled in Birmingham, was granted leave to remain in the UK in 2011 and became a British passport holder but his academic career floundered.</p> <p>At Wolverhampton University, he failed five out of seven modules on an IT course and did not submit written assessments the following year. He was asked to leave in 2010. Short-term jobs followed.</p> <p>He came to the attention of the police when he was stopped carrying a computer belonging to Ahmed Diini, who was later imprisoned in Egypt. The court heard that Abdalla was repeatedly detained at airports and ferry terminals under schedule 7 of the Terrorism Act, known as a \u201cport stop\u201d; often he was questioned for so long that he missed his flight or ferry.</p> <p>Details of his interviews were passed to MI5. On one occasion Abdalla told officers: \u201cI wish I was in Somalia: better to be killed and know your enemy.\u201d</p> <p>Abdalla came to believe that interference from the security services meant his girlfriend left him, his bank card stopped working and he lost jobs, the court was told. His barrister, Rajiv Menon QC, told the jury: \u201cThis is the stuff of nightmares from which there is no escape. This is what happens when you are targeted by the security services and decline to cooperate.\u201d</p> <p>Abdalla denied the charge of preparing acts of terrorism. His lawyer said he had been planning to slip unnoticed out of the UK and move to Bulgaria, where his cousin was studying. <br></p> <p>He falsified his qualifications in some job applications, Menon said, because he was desperate to work. He had participated in a fraudulent cheque scheme, it was said, in order to raise money to leave the country. A bank spotted that the cheques had been altered. Abdalla, who had fled, was arrested in Germany, returned to the UK on a European extradition warrant, jailed for breaching his bail and convicted of fraud.</p> <p>After being released, he was called into Stechford police station in Birmingham so that his confiscated laptop could be returned in February 2013. It was a set-up, Abdalla said. Counter-terrorism officers escorted him upstairs to a green-carpeted room with cameras and recording devices on the wall.</p> <p>Two men were inside, Abdalla told the court. One, who gave his name as \u201cPhil\u201d, stood up, shook his hand, praised his skills and asked if he would like to work for the security services \u201cgathering intelligence on targets\u201d.</p> <p>Abdalla said he told them he did not want to work for MI5 \u201cunless they could convince me it was a noble cause\u201d. Their debate allegedly degenerated into a row over rendition, kidnap and torture.</p> <p>Phil, Abdalla said, \u201cacknowledged they did certain things wrong \u2026 and made mistakes \u2026 but that that did not mean everything [MI5] did was wrong \u2026 At times he would be very angry. He said: \u2018It\u2019s in your best interest to work for us.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Three days after leaving the station, Abdalla said, Phil called him hoping to arrange another meeting. Abdalla said he rejected the offer and hung up. Over the following 18 months, he claimed, he received hundreds more telephone calls from the same number; sometimes five or 10 calls a day. Abdalla normally ignored them. Once, he said, he answered and a woman said: \u201cPhil wants to speak to you.\u201d Abdalla turned the phone off. <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>During an open session, the prosecution, led by Duncan Atkinson QC, challenged Abdalla\u2019s claim that he was fleeing from security force harassment and attempted to demonstrate that the difficulties in his life were due to other causes. The court was told that the defendant developed his reason for leaving the country long after his arrest.</p> <p>By 2015, Abdalla, who lived in Acocks Green, Birmingham, was one of the targets being investigated by an undercover officer, codename \u201cMuhamed\u201d, who had infiltrated alleged Isis supporters suspected of planning to smuggle themselves out of the UK to Syria, the court heard.</p> <p>One of the other men, Gabriel Rasmus, 29, from Lozells, Birmingham, has pleaded guilty to preparing acts of terrorism, the same offence under section 5(1) of the Terrorism Act 2006 with which Abdalla is charged.</p> <p>Abdalla and Rasmus, the prosecutor alleged, were planning to travel to Syria via Bulgaria and Turkey \u201cto join forces with so-called Islamic State and to offer their services, with their lives if necessary, to engage in acts of terrorism\u201d.</p> <p>His final, chaotic search for a lorry to smuggle him overseas was tracked by counter-terrorism officers. When he was detained at Dover, Abdalla held a valid UK passport and, like Rasmus, carried a rucksack containing an iPhone wrapped in foil, a second Nokia mobile, ID cards, \u00a3520 and \u20ac250 in cash, waterproof clothing, walking boots and a G-Shock watch. <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>One of the other men detained from the lorry was Mahamuud Diini, Ahmed\u2019s brother. The court was told he had also been trying to leave the country covertly. Diini, however, had been prosecuted previously for seeking to travel to Syria but was acquitted.</p> <p>Menon pointed out that Abdalla had also been carrying a blazer. \u201cWhy take a blazer,\u201d he asked, \u201cif you are heading for the frontline?\u201d <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p>",

But the programme has triggered criticism, with some consumers being told they must wait for more than a year for an engineer to visit.<br></p> <p>The motion also states that a London coroner\u2019s recommended changes to improve the product recall system following an earlier, fatal fire in 2010 involving a machine from a different manufacturer \u201chave not yet been made\u201d.

  "<p>Apples are everywhere: red, golden and green baubles hang from my allotment trees, the scent of the fallen ones drunkenly filling the air. At this time of year it is easy to see how apples have taken on such importance in our autumnal traditions and folklore: it is very much the end of the growing season, and my trees groan with fruit, which in stark contrast to the rest of my crops was produced almost effortlessly. They will easily store deep into winter with no fancy equipment required, and will provide hot puddings when other homegrown produce is long gone. To our ancestors they must have seemed sent from the gods, or at the very least worth revering and celebrating. </p> <p>I am currently <a href=\"https://unbound.com/books/the-new-almanac\">crowdfunding</a> the creation of an annual Almanac, a book that will celebrate the distinctiveness of each moment in the year, in part through food, foraging, folklore and festivities. So my mind is very much on apples and the games and traditions \u2013 not to mention the crumbles - that they inspire.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1ec029e12c3a1805d3cda7a06f3176ea163cba8a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1ec029e12c3a1805d3cda7a06f3176ea163cba8a/0_187_5616_3370/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A man knocks apples off tree branches during the apple harvest in Somerset.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018To our ancestors apples must have seemed sent from the gods, or at the very least worth revering and celebrating.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Graeme Robertson/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>To the Celts, apples were the fruit of the other world, of <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/place/Avalon-legendary-island\">Avalon</a>, the Isle of Apples. Their association with magic may stem from their abundance at the festival of Samhain which falls on the cusp of October and November, very much the pre-Christian precursor of Hallowe\u2019en. At <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samhain\">Samhain</a> it was believed that the veil between the worlds of the living and the dead was thinned, and it was a time to convene with ancestors, and to tell the future. Apples became associated with magic and divination, which manifested into traditions such as apple bobbing, once used to peer into the future. Girls of a village would dunk for apples, each of which had the initial of a suitable local young man carved into it: the one you got between your teeth was the one you were going to end up with. Another related custom had the young woman paring an apple of its skin and then hurling it over her shoulder: the peel would fall in the shape of the first letter of the name of her husband to be. </p> <p><a href=\"https://www.commonground.org.uk/apple-day/\">Apple Day</a> celebrations on and around October 21 (check local orchards for exact dates: my allotment site\u2019s community orchard is holding theirs on the October 16) will provide many opportunities to see children soaked from the shoulders up, enthusiastically hurling themselves into reenacting this ancient tradition without a thought for Avalon, the ancestors or a future spouse. It is a thread that reaches pleasingly back through time, a sign that we have not lost all connection with our landscape and with the magic and ritual once invested in our major crops.</p> <ul> <li><strong>Lia Leendertz\u2019s crowdfunding for The New Almanac is under way at <a href=\"https://unbound.com/books/the-new-almanac\">https://unbound.com/books/the-new-almanac</a>.

  "<p>Conservationists have turned to military strategy to ensure a new wild colony of red squirrels is protected from grey squirrels in Wales. A site at Ogwen valley, five miles from Bangor, has been selected because it is ringed by mountains and cut off from grey squirrels.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s easier to defend an area if there are geographical pinch points,\u201d said Craig Shuttleworth, a biologist based at Bangor Univserity and a specialist in squirrels. He added that he had adopted the approach of a \u201ctactical military strategist\u201d when planning where the colony should go.</p> <p>But red squirrels are staging a comeback in the areas. A project to rid the island of Anglesey of grey squirrels has seen an initial colony of 40 red squirrels grow to 700 since 1998.</p> <p>So successful has the project been that vanguard units of red squirrels have been crossing bridges to the mainland, where they have set up camp near Bangor. </p> <p>Conservationists are now transporting red squirrels from around the country to boost the colony and provide genetic reinforcements. \u201cWe want to bring in the extra genetic diversity,\u201d said Shuttleworth. </p> <p>Ten squirrels bred by the East Anglian Red Squirrel Group in Norfolk are among those destined for Wales in special squirrel boxes. </p> <p>Chrissie Kelley, head of species management at Pensthorpe Conservation Trust in north Norfolk, is overseeing the resettlement. \u201cOur colleagues in Wales know we breed good squirrels and ours will be joined by breeding stock from other places around the country to ensure the widest genetic mix possible,\u201d she said.</p> <p>The trust has previously sent squirrels to Anglesey, including several offspring of one red squirrel known as Tortoiseshell, who gave birth to 50 kittens before she died aged nine this year. Five of her great-grand-kittens, including a pair called Fire and Flame, will be among those travelling to the Ogwen valley.</p> <p> </p> <p>Native red squirrels have declined in Britain due to earlier persecution by people, habitat loss including deforestation and hence displacement by greys, and disease. Grey squirrels, which arrived from America in the 19th century, now outnumber reds by 20 to one and some conservationists fear the red species, <em>Sciurus vulgaris,</em> could disappear in a generation. </p> <p>Shuttleworth said red squirrels were very rare in Wales and non-native grey squirrels caused significant damage to the environment, and it was legitimate to control grey squirrel populations. </p> <p>\u201cIf you can\u2019t take action to conserve a cute, cuddly animal like the red squirrel what hope do we have for the less charismatic species [that are at risk]?\u201d he said. \u201cIt should be an easy win.\u201d</p>",

  "<p>Nigeria is racing to contain a polio outbreak in its north-east state of Borno, amid fears the virus could spread to neighbouring countries and set back global efforts towards eradication.</p> <p>This week, the UN children\u2019s fund, Unicef, launched an emergency vaccination drive in 18 states in northern Nigeria and neighbouring Chad, Niger, Cameroon and Central African Republic, to immunise more than 41 million children.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2016/apr/11/polio-cases-wiped-out-12-months-world-health-organisation-pakistan\">Polio cases could be wiped out within 12 months, says World Health Organisation</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Nearly 39,000 health workers will be deployed across the Lake Chad basin, where ongoing conflict with the insurgent group Boko Haram has forced <a href=\"https://data.unhcr.org/SahelSituation/download.php?id=2147\">2.6 million people to flee their homes</a> (pdf), leading to fears the virus could spread across borders.</p> <p>The four-day campaign will be the third of five vaccination drives to contain the wild strain of the polio virus. Two further campaigns are scheduled for November and December in Nigeria and neighbouring countries.</p> <p>Global efforts to eradicate polio suffered a setback in August when, after two years free of transmission, <a href=\"http://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/releases/2016/nigeria-polio/en/\">two cases of polio were detected in Borno state</a>, followed by another in September. Nigeria is the last country in Africa and one of only three in the world where polio remains. Afghanistan and Pakistan are the other two.</p> <p>A country cannot be declared polio-free until three years have passed with no new cases. Earlier this year, the World Health Organisation said it believed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2016/apr/11/polio-cases-wiped-out-12-months-world-health-organisation-pakistan\">transmission of the virus could be stopped within 12 months</a>.</p> <p>Doune Porter, Unicef Nigeria\u2019s chief of communication, said: \u201cWe have to respond, and we are indeed responding, with a massive show of force to make sure that it does not get out of control. We can\u2019t afford to have polio come back to the area, to Nigeria or Africa.\u201d</p> <p>Although the polio vaccine is relatively simple to administer, large parts of Borno state have, for some years, been inaccessible to humanitarian organisations due to the Boko Haram insurgency. This has meant large numbers of children have never been immunised against life-threatening diseases.</p> <p>This drive, which will involve door-to-door visits from health workers, will include 750,000 people in territory taken back by Nigerian government forces earlier this year. However, large areas of north-east Nigeria still cannot be reached with any kind of humanitarian assistance.</p> <p>Porter said immunisations were crucial in keeping the re-emergence of polio in Nigeria under control, saying the new cases earlier this year were a \u201chuge disappointment\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cWe need to start the clock again and of course there is the question of accessing more children with immunisation. However, it\u2019s important to remember that it\u2019s not going back to having huge numbers of polio cases. It doesn\u2019t undo the great progress that has been made. It\u2019s important to remember we\u2019ve come a long way.\u201d</p> <p>The vaccination teams will also conduct malnutrition screenings among children under five. According to Unicef, <a href=\"http://www.unicef.org.uk/Media-centre/Press-releases/Unicef-more-than-doubles-its-funding-appeal-to-provide-life-saving-assistance-for-children-in-northeast-Nigeria/\">400,000 children in the three Nigerian states worst affected by the conflict</a> will suffer from severe acute malnutrition this year.</p>",
  "<p>A Sky shareholder has called for James Murdoch to be replaced as chairman, arguing that his appointment breached the corporate governance code and is a major conflict of interest because he is the chief executive of its biggest shareholder, 21st Century Fox.</p> <p>Royal London Asset Management, which owns \u00a352m in Sky shares, said shareholders needed an independent chairman and criticised the process by which Murdoch was appointed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/jan/29/james-murdoch-sky-chairman-rupert-murdoch\">earlier this year</a>.</p> <p>Murdoch, a non-executive director at Sky, was the only candidate put forward by its nominations committee to take over from the then chairman, Nick Ferguson.</p> <p>Murdoch had been forced to stand down as chairman of Sky in 2012 after the phone-hacking scandal at News International, publisher of the Sun, Times, Sunday Times and now defunct News of the World, where he had been chairman.</p> <p>Piers Hillier, the chief investment officer at Royal London, said: \u201cWe continue to believe that James Murdoch\u2019s reappointment as chairman of Sky is inappropriate.\u201d Hillier was speaking as Sky held its <a href=\"https://corporate.sky.com/documents/investors/annual-general-meeting/notice_of_meeting_2016.pdf\">annual general meeting (pdf)</a> at the company\u2019s Osterley campus in west London on Thursday. \u201cShould Fox make a bid for Sky, investors need a strong, independent chairman to protect the interests of minority shareholders and negotiate the best possible deal,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Murdoch, speaking to the Guardian after the annual meeting, dismissed concerns about the conflict of interest of his role. \u201cWell I\u2019m not qualified as independent because I\u2019m not an independent director, being associated with the major shareholder,\u201d he said. \u201cYou saw there were no questions from shareholders here. So It\u2019s not for me to comment on.\u201d</p> <p>Murdoch was appointed by a three-member committee of Sky directors, including the Aberdeen Asset Management chief executive, Martin Gilbert, now the Sky deputy chairman, and the independent director Dave Lewis, the chief executive of Tesco, who will stand down from the board after Thursday\u2019s shareholder meeting.</p> <p>Murdoch was then unanimously voted in as chairman by his 11 fellow board members, six of whom are independent directors. \u201cNo attempts were made to advertise the position externally, or appoint an agency, which goes against the UK corporate governance code,\u201d Hillier said.</p> <p>Last week, shareholder advisory firm Pirc said investors should vote to oppose Murdoch\u2019s reappointment as chairman citing similar issues, such as a lack of independence and concerns about appointment process not being an \u201cobjective\u201d one.</p> <p>Pirc also recommended a vote against non-executive directors Chase Carey and John Nallen, both of whom are senior executives at 21st Century Fox, which has a 39.6% stake in Sky.</p> <p>Broadcasting regulator Ofcom heavily criticised Murdoch\u2019s conduct in handling the phone-hacking scandal, saying it \u201crepeatedly fell short\u201d of what was expected of a chairman.</p> <p>The culture select committee also weighed in, concluding that Murdoch had showed \u201cwilful ignorance\u201d of phone hacking.</p> <p>News International, which was rebranded News UK in 2013, is part of News Corp, the newspaper company founded by Murdoch\u2019s father, Rupert. The Fox TV, film and entertainment business was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/jun/28/news-corp-split-rupert-murdoch\">spun out of News Corp</a> as a separately listed company in 2013.</p> <p>The Murdoch family was forced to give up on an \u00a38bn-plus News Corp bid to take full control of Sky in 2011 as the fallout from the phone hacking scandal made it too politically difficult to complete.</p> <p>Asked at the AGM about a potential renewed bid by Fox, Murdoch said that the meeting was not the forum to talk about \u201chypothetical scenarios\u201d but added that Sky had \u201crobust processes and procedures in place to deal with any related party transactions\u201d.</p> <p>He handed the investor query to Andrew Sukawaty, the non-executive chairman of Inmarsat, who was appointed senior independent director when Murdoch was made chairman.</p> <p>\u201cIn terms of the hypothetical transaction you refer to well the company been through that before,\u201d Sukawaty said. \u201cThe independent directors on the board have demonstrated how they can be independent in that particular situation. In addition to all that we have shored ourselves up so to speak. Not only that we have a senior independent director and deputy chairman in Martin Gilbert. </p> <p>\u201cTogether we will stand up and make sure any process that is required to make sure any transaction that is dealt with is dealt with properly. Belt and braces. We [would] take extraordinary measures to deal with that.\u201d</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.frc.org.uk/Our-Work/Codes-Standards/Corporate-governance/UK-Corporate-Governance-Code.aspx\">UK corporate governance code</a> is not legally binding and companies only have to \u201ccomply or explain\u201d.</p> <p>Sky decided against informing or consulting shareholders about the appointment of Murdoch, although there is no legal corporate governance requirement to do so.</p> <p>In the four years since he moved into a non-executive directorship, investors have never voted against his reappointment at an annual general meeting.</p>",
  "<p>Boris Johnson has given his first hint that the west may be willing to step up military activity against the Syrian government of Bashar al-Assad, saying a meeting of foreign ministers on Sunday will look at new options.<br></p> <p>He stressed he did not want to give false hope to the Syrian opposition, and said it might be a long day\u2019s march, but \u201cmore kinetic options, the military options\u201d were being considered.<br></p> <p>He said as a result of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/12/ground-down-by-savagery-the-agony-of-aleppo\">bombardment of Aleppo</a> public opinion was changing, but it remained to be seen if a military coalition could be put together. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/reality-check/2016/oct/12/reality-check-are-us-led-airstrikes-on-syrians-as-bad-as-russias\">Reality check: are US-led airstrikes on Syrians as bad as Russia's?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>He insisted no new military initiative could go ahead without US support, but revealed he had held talks with advisers close to the Democratic presidential candidate, Hillary Clinton, and added that Clinton had taken a tougher line than the incumbent, Barack Obama.</p> <p>\u201cMost people I think are changing their minds on this and are thinking we cannot let this go on forever. We cannot just see Aleppo pulverised in this way. We have to do something. The mood of the House of Commons has changed from 2013. Whether that means we can get a coalition for a more kinetic action now I cannot prophesy. But what most people want to see now is a new set of options,\u201d Johnson said.<br></p> <p>He also indicated that the west was on the verge of abandoning the negotiating format of the 25-nation International Syria Support Group (ISSG), including Russia and Iran, and may in future instead work with a smaller group.</p> <p>He said the last meeting of the ISSG had ended in recrimination, and had been largely purposeless. He said: \u201cIt has not worked. The last session was extremely acrimonious. It turned into a slanging match in which the Iranians came to the assistance of the Russians. The conversation got nowhere.</p> <p>\u201cIt is very important not to get hopes up too high. This house took a big step backwards from intervention when it <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/aug/30/cameron-mps-syria\">voted against military action in 2013</a>. We vacated the space that has been occupied by the Russians.\u201d</p> <p>Options under consideration included extra help on the humanitarian front, and providing warnings to the people of Aleppo of impending airstrikes.</p> <p>Johnson also revealed he was looking to step up economic sanctions against those close to the Assad regime, as well as the Russians.</p> <p>The Sunday meeting in London will also discuss preparations for the imminent attack on Mosul, the second city of Iraq and currently the last Iraqi stronghold of Islamic State.<br></p> <p>Johnson, speaking at the foreign affairs select committee, repeated the previous concerns of the prime minister that a no-fly zone held many difficulties, including the risk that coalition forces might need to strike at Russian aircraft. Other options have been canvassed inside the Ministry of Defence, it is understood, including attacks on Syrian helicopters responsible for barrel bombs and incendiary bombs.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2016/oct/13/boris-johnson-public-mood-over-syria-intervention-changed-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/57a3b\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2802368\"            data-video-name=\"Boris Johnson: public mood over Syria intervention has changed \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"Parliament TV\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-57ff5ae7e4b05d915e4247be\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/10/13/161013boris2_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/10/13/161013boris2_V3.webm\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/10/13/161013boris2.m3u8\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2016/oct/13/boris-johnson-public-mood-over-syria-intervention-changed-video\">Boris Johnson: public mood over Syria intervention has changed</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>Key figures in the Syrian opposition, including the Kurds, have also called for more arms, and the possible tracking of Russian aircraft so their flights and bombing sorties are properly recorded. </p> <p>Johnson said while it was time to look again at military options, he had to be realistic. \u201cWe cannot do anything without the Americans, and we are still a pretty long day\u2019s march from getting there,\u201d he said.</p> <p>A Foreign Office spokesman later played down Johnson\u2019s remarks, saying: \u201cIt is wrong to interpret the foreign secretary\u2019s comments as a suggestion that this is the first step towards military action in Syria. There are no such plans.</p> <p>\u201cAs the prime minister and foreign secretary said yesterday, we want to see an end to the conflict in Syria.

He said 95% of those killed had been murdered by the Assad regime backed up by the Russians and the Iranians. \u201cThose are the culprits,\u201d he said.</p> <p>More broadly, Johnson said, \u201cwe have a very serious problem with Russia\u201d and he accused them of being \u201creckless and aggressive\u201d. But he insisted the answer was to engage and he denied that Russia posed the same threat to the west as the old Soviet Union.</p> <p>Johnson\u2019s remarks came as a senior Russian military officer said Moscow was prepared to guarantee safe passage for rebels leaving eastern Aleppo with their weapons.</p> <p>\u201cWe are ready to ensure the safe withdrawal of armed rebels, the unimpeded passage of civilians to and from eastern Aleppo, as well as the delivery of humanitarian aid there,\u201d Lieutenant General Sergei Rudskoy said in a televised briefing.</p>",
  "<p>Last March, my 71-year-old grandmother, Betty, waited in line for three hours to caucus for Bernie Sanders. The wait to be able to cast her first-ever vote in a primary election was punishing, but nothing could have deterred her. Betty \u2013 a white woman who left school after ninth grade, had her first child at age 16 and spent much of her life in severe poverty \u2013 wanted to vote.</p> <p>So she waited with busted knees that once stood on factory lines. She waited with smoking-induced emphysema and the false teeth she\u2019s had since her late 20s \u2013 both markers of our class. She waited with a womb that in the 1960s, before Roe v Wade, she paid a stranger to thrust a wire hanger inside after she discovered she was pregnant by a man she\u2019d fled after he broke her jaw.</p> <p>Betty worked for many years as a probation officer for the state judicial system in Wichita, Kansas, keeping tabs on men who had murdered and raped. As a result, it\u2019s hard to faze her, but she has pronounced Republican candidate Donald Trump a sociopath \u201cwhose mouth overloads his ass\u201d.</p> <p>No one loathes Trump \u2013 who suggested women should be <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/31/us/politics/donald-trump-abortion.html\">punished</a> for having abortions, who said hateful things about groups of people she has loved and worked alongside since childhood, whose pomp and indecency offends her modest, midwestern sensibility \u2013 more than she.</p> <p>Yet, it is white working-class people like Betty who have become a particular fixation among the chattering class during this election: what is this angry beast, and why does it support Trump?<br></p> <h2>Not so poor: Trump voters are middle class</h2> <p>Hard numbers complicate, if not roundly dismiss, the oft-regurgitated theory that income or education levels predict Trump support, or that working-class whites support him disproportionately. Last month, <a href=\"http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2822059\">results of 87,000 interviews </a>conducted by Gallup showed that those who liked Trump were under no more economic distress or immigration-related anxiety than those who opposed him.</p> <p>According to the study, his supporters didn\u2019t have lower incomes or higher unemployment levels than other Americans. Income data misses a lot; those with healthy earnings might also have negative wealth or downward mobility. But respondents overall weren\u2019t clinging to jobs perceived to be endangered. \u201cSurprisingly\u201d, a Gallup researcher wrote, \u201cthere appears to be no link whatsoever between exposure to trade competition and support for nationalist policies in America, as embodied by the Trump campaign.\u201d</p> <p>Earlier this year, primary exit polls revealed that Trump voters were, in fact, more affluent than most Americans, with a <a href=\"http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-mythology-of-trumps-working-class-support/\">median household income of $72,000</a> \u2013 higher than that of Hillary Clinton or Bernie Sanders supporters. Forty-four percent of them had college degrees, well above the national average of 33% among whites or 29% overall. In January, political scientist Matthew MacWilliams <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/01/donald-trump-2016-authoritarian-213533\">reported</a> findings that a penchant for authoritarianism \u2013 not income, education, gender, age or race \u2013predicted Trump support.</p> <p>These facts haven\u2019t stopped pundits and journalists from pushing story after story about the white working class\u2019s giddy embrace of a bloviating demagogue.</p> <p>In seeking to explain Trump\u2019s appeal, proportionate media coverage would require more stories about the racism and misogyny among white Trump supporters in tony suburbs. Or, if we\u2019re examining economically driven bitterness among the working class, stories about the Democratic lawmakers who in recent decades ended welfare as we knew it, hopped in the sack with Wall Street and forgot American labor in their global trade agreements.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We don\u2019t need their analysis, and we sure don\u2019t need their tears. What we need is to have our stories told</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>But, for national media outlets comprised largely of middle- and upper-class liberals, that would mean looking their own class in the face.</p> <p>The faces journalists do train the cameras on \u2013 hateful ones screaming sexist vitriol next to Confederate flags \u2013 must receive coverage but do not speak for the communities I know well. That the media industry ignored my home for so long left a vacuum of understanding in which the first glimpse of an economically downtrodden white is presumed to represent the whole.</p> <p>Part of the current glimpse is JD Vance, author of the bestselling new memoir <a href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/the-lives-of-poor-white-people\">Hillbilly Elegy</a>. A successful attorney who had a precariously middle-class upbringing in an Ohio steel town, Vance wrote of the chaos that can haunt a family with generational memory of deep poverty. A conservative who says he won\u2019t vote for Trump, Vance speculates about why working-class whites will: cultural anxiety that arises when opioid overdose kills your friends and the political establishment has proven it will throw you under the bus. While his theories may hold up in some corners, in interviews coastal media members have repeatedly asked Vance to speak for the entire white working class.</p> <p>His interviewers and reviewers often seem relieved to find someone with ownership on the topic whose ideas in large part confirm their own. The New York Times election podcast <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/19/podcasts/understanding-the-trump-voter.html?_r=0\">The Run-Up</a> said Vance\u2019s memoir \u201cdoubles as a cultural anthropology of the white underclass that has flocked to the Republican presidential nominee\u2019s candidacy\u201d. (The Times teased its review of the book with the tweet: \u201cWant to know more about the people who fueled the rise of Donald Trump?\u201d)</p> <p>While Vance happens to have roots in Kentucky mining country, most downtrodden whites are not conservative male Protestants from Appalachia. That sometimes seems the only concept of them that the American consciousness can contain: tucked away in a remote mountain shanty like a coal-dust-covered ghost, as though white poverty isn\u2019t always right in front of us, swiping our credit cards at a Target in Denver or asking for cash on a Los Angeles sidewalk.</p> <p>One-dimensional stereotypes fester where journalism fails to tread. The last time I saw my native class receive substantial focus, before now, was over 20 years ago \u2013 not in the news but on the television show <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roseanne\">Roseanne</a>, the fictional storylines of which remain more accurate than the musings of comfortable commentators in New York studios.</p> <p>Countless images of working-class progressives, including women such as Betty, are thus rendered invisible by a ratings-fixated media that covers elections as horse races and seeks sensational b-roll. </p> <p>This media paradigm created the tale of a divided America \u2013 \u201cred\u201d v \u201cblue\u201d\u2013 in which the 42% of Kansans who voted for Barack Obama in 2008 are meaningless. </p> <p>This year, more Kansans <a href=\"http://usuncut.com/politics/bernie-sanders-wins-kansas/\">caucused for Bernie Sanders</a> than for Donald Trump \u2013 a newsworthy point I never saw noted in national press, who perhaps couldn\u2019t fathom that \u201cflyover country\u201d might contain millions of Americans more progressive than their Clinton strongholds. </p> <p>In lieu of such coverage, media makers cast the white working class as a monolith and imply an old, treacherous story convenient to capitalism: that the poor are dangerous idiots.</p> <h2>Poor whiteness and poor character</h2> <p>The two-fold myth about the white working class \u2013 that they are to blame for Trump\u2019s rise, and that those among them who support him for the worst reasons exemplify the rest \u2013 takes flight on the wings of moral superiority affluent Americans often pin upon themselves.</p> <p>I have never seen them flap so insistently as in today\u2019s election commentary, where notions of poor whiteness and poor character are routinely conflated. </p> <p>In an election piece last March in the National Review, writer Kevin Williamson\u2019s assessment of poor white voters \u2013 among whom mortality rates have sharply risen in recent decades \u2013 expressed what many conservatives and liberals alike may well believe when he observed that communities ravaged by oxycodone use \u201c<a href=\"https://www.nationalreview.com/nrd/articles/432569/father-f-hrer\">deserve to die</a>\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThe white American underclass is in thrall to a vicious, selfish culture whose main products are misery and used heroin needles,\u201d Williamson wrote. \u201cDonald Trump\u2019s speeches make them feel good. So does OxyContin.\u201d</p> <p>For confirmation that this point is lost on most reporters, not just conservative provocateurs, look no further than a recent Washington Post <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/sf/national/2016/08/31/opiods-and-anti-anxiety-medication-are-killing-white-american-women/\">series</a> that explored spiking <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/national/white-death/\">death rates</a> among rural white women by fixating on their smoking habits and graphically detailing the \u201chaggard face\u201d and embalming processes of their <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/life-lessons-from-a-small-town-undertaker-as-white-women-die-younger-in-america/2016/08/20/a1e64d76-60b6-11e6-af8e-54aa2e849447_story.html\">corpses</a>. Imagine wealthy white woman examined thusly after their deaths. The outrage among family and friends with the education, time, and agency to write letters to the editor would have been deafening.</p> <p>A sentiment that I care for even less than contempt or degradation is their tender cousin: pity.</p> <p>In a recent op-ed headlined <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/20/opinion/dignity-and-sadness-in-the-working-class.html\">Dignity and Sadness in the Working Class</a>, David Brooks told of a laid-off Kentucky metal worker he met. On his last day, the man left to rows of cheering coworkers \u2013 a moment I read as triumphant, but that Brooks declared pitiable. How hard the man worked for so little, how great his skills and how dwindling their value, Brooks pointed out, for people he said radiate \u201cthe residual sadness of the lonely heart\u201d.</p> <p>I\u2019m hard-pressed to think of a worse slight than the media figures who have disregarded the embattled white working class for decades now beseeching the country to have sympathy for them. We don\u2019t need their analysis, and we sure don\u2019t need their tears. What we need is to have our stories told, preferably by someone who can walk into a factory without his own guilt fogging his glasses.</p> <p>One such journalist, Alexander Zaitchik, spent several months on the road in six states getting to know white working-class people who do support Trump. His goal for the resulting new book, <a href=\"http://www.alternet.org/books/gilded-rage-conversation-trump-supporter-will-surprise-you\">The Gilded Rage</a>, was to convey the human complexity that daily news misses. Zaitchik wrote that his mission arose from frustration with \u201c\u2018hot takes\u2019 written by people living several time zones and income brackets away from their subjects\u201d.</p> <p>Zaitchik wisely described those he met as a \u201cblue-collar middle class\u201d\u2013 mostly white people who have worked hard and lost a lot, whether in the market crash of 2008 or the manufacturing layoffs of recent decades. He found that their motivations overwhelmingly \u201cstarted with economics and ended with economics\u201d. The anger he observed was \u201cpointed up, not down\u201d at those who forgot them when global trade deals were negotiated, not at minority groups.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the racism and nationalism that surely exist among them also exist among Democrats and higher socioeconomic strata. A poll conducted last spring by Reuters <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/usa-election-trump-idUSKBN0TQ2QT20151208\">found</a> that a third of questioned Democrats supported a temporary ban on Muslims entering the United States. In another, by YouGov, <a href=\"https://today.yougov.com/news/2015/12/09/most-americans-dislike-islam/\">45%</a> of polled Democrats reported holding an unfavorable view of Islam, with almost no fluctuation based on household income. Those who won\u2019t vote for Trump are not necessarily paragons of virtue, while the rest are easily scapegoated as the country\u2019s moral scourge.</p> <p>When Hillary Clinton recently declared half of Trump supporters a \u201cbasket of deplorables\u201d, Zaitchik told another reporter, the language \u201ccould be read as another way of saying \u2018white-trash bin\u2019.\u201d Clinton quickly apologized for the comment, the context of which contained compassion for many Trump voters. But making such generalizations at a $6m fundraiser in downtown New York City, at which some attendees paid $50,000 for a seat, recalled for me scenes from the television political satire Veep in which powerful Washington figures discuss \u201cnormals\u201d with distaste behind closed doors.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"debc21966234342f2a0bad89ca20f9386628f7bd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/debc21966234342f2a0bad89ca20f9386628f7bd/0_0_2000_1488/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The DeBruce Grain elevator.

Federal safety inspectors had not visited it for 16 years when an explosion ripped through the half-mile long structure, killing seven workers.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Cliff Schiappa/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>When we talked, Zaitchik mentioned HBO talk-show host Bill Maher, who he pointed out \u201cbasically makes eugenics-level arguments about anyone who votes for Donald Trump having congenital defects. You would never get away with talking that way about any other group of people and still have a TV show.\u201d</p> <p>Maher is, perhaps, the pinnacle of classist smugness. In the summer of 1998, when I was 17 and just out of high school, I worked at a grain elevator during the wheat harvest. An elevator 50 miles east in Haysville, Kansas, exploded (grain dust is highly combustible), <a href=\"http://www.kansas.com/news/article986253.html\">killing seven workers</a>. The accident rattled my community and reminded us about the physical dangers my family and I often faced as farmers.</p> <p>I kept going to work like everyone else and, after a long day weighing wheat trucks and hauling heavy sacks of feed in and out of the mill, liked to watch Politically Incorrect, the ABC show Maher hosted then. With the search for one of the killed workers\u2019 bodies still under way, Maher joked, as I recall, that the people should check their loaves of Wonder Bread.</p> <p>That moment was perhaps my first reckoning with the hard truth that, throughout my life, I would politically identify with the same people who often insult the place I am from.</p> <p>Such derision is so pervasive that it\u2019s often imperceptible to the economically privileged. Those who write, discuss, and publish newspapers, books, and magazines with best intentions sometimes offend with obliviousness.</p> <p>Many people recommended to me the bestselling new history book <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/22/books/review-white-trash-ruminates-on-an-american-underclass.html\">White Trash</a>, for instance, without registering that its title is a slur that refers to me and the people I love as garbage. My happy relief that someone set out to tell this ignored thread of our shared past was squashed by my wincing every time I saw it on my shelf, so much so that I finally took the book jacket off. Incredibly, promotional copy for the book commits precisely the elitist shaming Isenberg is out to expose: \u201c(the book) takes on our comforting myths about equality, uncovering the crucial legacy of the ever-present, always embarrassing \u2013 if occasionally entertaining \u2013poor white trash.\u201d </p> <p>The book itself is more sensitively wrought and imparts facts that one hopes would dismantle popular use of its titular term. But even Isenberg can\u2019t escape our classist frameworks.</p> <p>When <a href=\"http://www.wnyc.org/story/americas-long-unaddressed-history-class/\">On the Media</a> host Brooke Gladstone asked Isenberg, earlier this year, to address long-held perceptions of poor whites as bigots, the author described a conundrum:\u201cThey do subscribe to certain views that are undoubtedly racist, and you can\u2019t mask it and pretend that it\u2019s not there. It is very much a part of their thinking.\u201d</p> <p>Entertain a parallel broad statement about any other disenfranchised group, and you might begin to see how rudimentary class discussion is for this relatively young country that long believed itself to be free of castes. Isenberg has sniffed out the hypocrisy in play, though.</p> <p>\u201cThe other problem is when people want to blame poor whites for being the only racist in the room,\u201d she told Gladstone. \u201c\u2026 as if they\u2019re more racist than everyone else.\u201d</p> <p>That problem is rooted in the notion that higher class means higher integrity. As journalist Lorraine Berry wrote last month, \u201cThe story remains that only the ignorant would be racist. Racism disappears with education we\u2019re told.\u201d As the first from my family to hold degrees, I assure you that none of us had to go to college to learn basic human decency.</p> <p>Berry points out that Ivy-League-minted Republicans shepherded the rise of the alt-right. Indeed, it was not poor whites \u2013 not even white Republicans \u2013 who passed legislation bent on preserving segregation, or who watched the Confederate flag raised outside state capitols for decades to come.</p> <p>It wasn\u2019t poor whites who criminalized blackness by way of marijuana laws and the \u201cwar on drugs\u201d.</p> <p>Nor was it poor whites who conjured the specter of the black \u201cwelfare queen\u201d.</p> <p>These points should not minimize the horrors of racism at the lowest economic rungs of society, but remind us that those horrors reside at the top in different forms and with more terrible power.</p> <p>Among reporters and commentators this election cycle, then, a steady finger ought be pointed at whites with economic leverage: social conservatives who donate to Trump\u2019s campaign while being too civilized to attend a political rally and yell what they really believe.</p> <h2>Mainstream media is set up to fail the ordinary American</h2> <p>Based on Trump\u2019s campaign rhetoric and available data, it appears that most of his voters this November will be people who are getting by well enough but who think of themselves as victims.</p> <p>One thing the media misses is that a great portion of the white working class would align with any sense before victimhood. Right now they are clocking in and out of work, sorting their grocery coupons, raising their children to respect others, and avoiding political news coverage.</p> <p>Barack Obama, a black man formed by the black experience, often cites his maternal lineage in the white working class. \u201cA lot of what\u2019s shaped me came from my grandparents who grew up on the prairie in Kansas,\u201d he <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/obama-thank-god-im-a-country-boy/article/2603608\">wrote</a> this month to mark a White House forum on rural issues. </p> <p>Last year, talking with author Marilynne Robinson for the New York Review of Books, Obama lamented common misconceptions of small-town middle America, for which he has a sort of reverence. \u201cThere\u2019s this huge gap between how folks go about their daily lives and how we talk about our common life and our political life,\u201d he said, naming one cause as \u201cthe filters that stand between ordinary people\u201d who are busy getting by and complicated policy debates. </p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m very encouraged when I meet people in their environments,\u201d Obama told Robinson. \u201cSomehow it gets distilled at the national political level in ways that aren\u2019t always as encouraging.\u201d</p> <p>To be sure, one discouraging distillation \u2013 the caricature of the hate-spewing white male Trump voter with grease on his jeans \u2013 is a real person of sorts. There were one or two in my town: the good ol\u2019 boy who menaces those with less power than himself \u2013 running people of color out of town with the threat of violence, denigrating women, shooting BB guns at stray cats for fun. They are who Trump would be if he\u2019d been born where I was.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We don\u2019t need their analysis, and we sure don\u2019t need their tears. What we need is to have our stories told</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Media fascination with the hateful white Trump voter fuels the theory, now in fashion, that bigotry is the only explanation for supporting him. Certainly, financial struggle does not predict a soft spot for Trump, as cash-strapped people of color \u2013 who face the threat of his racism and xenophobia, and who resoundingly reject him, by all available measures \u2013 can attest. However, one imagines that elite white liberals who maintain an air of ethical grandness this election season would have a harder time thinking globally about trade and immigration if it were their factory job that was lost and their community that was decimated. </p> <p>Affluent analysts who oppose Trump, though, have a way of taking a systemic view when examining social woes but viewing their place on the political continuum as a triumph of individual character. Most of them presumably inherited their political bent, just like most of those in \u201cred\u201d America did. If you were handed liberalism, give yourself no pats on the back for your vote against Trump.</p> <p>Spare, too, the condescending argument that disaffected Democrats who joined Republican ranks in recent decades are \u201cvoting against their own best interests,\u201d undemocratic in its implication that a large swath of America isn\u2019t mentally fit to cast a ballot. </p> <p>Whoever remains on Trump\u2019s side as stories concerning his treatment of women, racism and other dangers continue to unfurl gets no pass from me for any reason. They are capable of voting, and they own their decisions. Let\u2019s be aware of our class biases, though, as we discern who \u201cthey\u201d are.</p> <h2>Journalist? Then the chances are you\u2019re not blue collar</h2> <p>A recent print-edition New York Times cutline <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/11/opinion/sunday/we-need-somebody-spectacular-views-from-trump-country.html\">described</a> a Kentucky man:</p> <blockquote> <p>\u201cMitch Hedges, who farms cattle and welds coal-mining equipment. He expects to lose his job in six months, but does not support Mr Trump, who he says is \u2018an idiot.\u2019\u201d</p> </blockquote> <p>This made me cheer for the rare spotlight on a member of the white working class who doesn\u2019t support Trump. It also made me laugh \u2013 one can\u2019t \u201cfarm cattle\u201d. One farms crops, and one raises livestock. It\u2019s sometimes hard for a journalist who has done both to take the New York Times seriously.</p> <p>The main reason that national media outlets have a blind spot in matters of class is the lack of socioeconomic diversity within their ranks. Few people born to deprivation end up working in newsrooms or publishing books. So few, in fact, that this former laborer has found cause to shift her entire writing career to talk specifically about class in a wealth-privileged industry, much as journalists of color find themselves talking about race in a whiteness-privileged one.</p> <p>This isn\u2019t to say that one must reside among a given group or place to do it justice, of course, as good muckrakers and commentators have shown for the past century and beyond. See On the Media\u2019s fine new series on poverty, the second episode of which includes Gladstone\u2019s reflection that \u201cthe poor are no more monolithic than the rest of us.\u201d</p> <p>I know journalists to be hard-working people who want to get the story right, and I\u2019m resistant to rote condemnations of \u201cthe media\u201d. The classism of cable-news hosts merely reflects the classism of privileged America in general. It\u2019s everywhere, from tweets describing Trump voters as inbred hillbillies to a Democratic campaign platform that didn\u2019t bother with a specific anti-poverty platform until a month out from the general election.</p> <p>The economic trench between reporter and reported on has never been more hazardous than at this moment of historic wealth disparity, though, when stories focus more often on the stock market than on people who own no stocks. American journalism has been willfully obtuse about the grievances on Main Streets for decades \u2013 surely a factor in digging the hole of resentment that Trump\u2019s venom now fills. That the term \u201cpopulism\u201d has become a pejorative among prominent liberal commentators should give us great pause. A journalism that embodies the plutocracy it\u2019s supposed to critique has failed its watchdog duty and lost the respect of people who call bullshit when they see it. </p> <p>One such person was my late grandfather, Arnie. Men like Trump sometimes drove expensive vehicles up the gravel driveway of our Kansas farmhouse looking to do some sort of business. Grandpa would recognize them as liars and thieves, treat them kindly, and send them packing. If you shook their hands, after they left Grandpa would laugh and say, \u201cBetter count your fingers.\u201d</p> <p>In a world in which the Bettys and Arnies of the world have little voice, those who enjoy a platform from which to speak might examine their hearts and minds before stepping onto the soap box.</p> <p>If you would stereotype a group of people by presuming to guess their politics or deeming them inferior to yourself \u2013 say, the ones who worked third shift on a Boeing floor while others flew to Mexico during spring break; the ones who mopped a McDonald\u2019s bathroom while others argued about the minimum wage on Twitter; the ones who cleaned out their lockers at a defunct Pabst factory while others drank craft beer at trendy bars; the ones who came back from the Middle East in caskets while others wrote op-eds about foreign policy \u2013 then consider that you might have more in common with Trump than you would like to admit.</p>",
  "<p>An email arrives from a young, discouraged restaurant cook who has recently parted company with her employers. It had been her dream job; the kind of serious kitchen in rural England to which she had long aspired. There was a contract, giving her 40 hours a week on minimum wage. No, she wouldn\u2019t get rich, but she would be doing something&#xa0;she loved.She would be learning on the job. Then the rota turned up: 60 hours a week. With no extra pay. For her labours she would be getting below the minimum wage. She took it up with her bosses. Ach, they said. Standard industry practice. She pointed out it was illegal. Now she is looking for another job.</p> <p>While she showed me various documents to back up her claims, it speaks volumes that she wouldn\u2019t go on the record. She wants to continue working in the industry and fears being blackballed. She may be very wise. Figures released last month showed that of 700 firms named and shamed by HMRC for paying below the minimum wage since 2014, only three have been prosecuted.</p> <p>Instead, I went onto social media and invited other cooks to email me with corroborating evidence. As one tweeter put it: \u201cYou\u2019re gonna need a bigger inbox.\u201d It was a deluge. Of course, it\u2019s not everybody. In recent months, the likes of Michel Roux Jnr and Sat Bains have cut the numbers of services they\u2019re open for, specifically to attract and retain the highest calibre of staff by offering better terms and conditions. The higher reaches of the London restaurant business report chef shortages, with suitable applicants able to set their own terms.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/sep/18/chef-shortage-could-change-way-we-eat-restaurants\">Too few chefs: how a staffing crisis could change what we eat</a> </p> </aside>  <p>However, the stories from further down the industry \u2013 of young commis chefs simply expected to put up and shut up, of abuse by head chefs, of illegal working practices \u2013 give the lie to the glossy media image of life in the kitchen brigade. In these mythical kitchens in magazines and on TV you graft hard and pursue your passion \u2013 it\u2019s always about \u201cpassion\u201d \u2013 encouraged by sympathetic colleagues, and a fair wage.</p> <p>Part of the problem is young cooks themselves who, as one chef put it to me, \u201clove what they do, love doing it with the freaks and sociopaths around them and don\u2019t care particularly for the world outside their steamy, hot and noisy caves\u201d. They take what they\u2019re given. But a bigger issue is the customer. Every week someone complains below my review online about price. It doesn\u2019t matter whether it\u2019s \u00a350 for two or \u00a3140. It\u2019s always too much. They think someone is screwing them.</p> <p>Yes, there are people getting rich from restaurants. They\u2019re usually the venture capitalists behind the dreary high-street chains, which use economies of scale to keep costs low. As to the rest, it\u2019s a struggle. The middle classes will rally to the cause of low-paid workers in a sports merchandise warehouse but when it comes to the exploited ranks cooking their dinner they moan endlessly about price.</p> <p>Earlier this year, revered New York chef David Chang <a href=\"http://www.gq.com/story/david-chang-resturant-business-challenges\">wrote a piece for<em> </em>American<em> GQ</em></a> in which he said bluntly that the business was all but impossible. \u201cThe longer chefs look at restaurant math,\u201d he wrote, \u201cthe less it adds up for them.\u201d</p> <p>He described the costs he faced and concluded, \u201cFood needs to get more expensive ...\u201d Ignore him if you wish. Dismiss the young woman who wrote to me as a spineless whinger. But if you do, unscrupulous restaurateurs will simply carry on breaking the law. And all to keep us fed.</p>",
  "<p>Next year\u2019s series of 24 is make or break. With Kiefer Sutherland busy wringing his hands on the curiously underpowered <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2016/sep/30/designated-survivor-kiefer-sutherland-jack-bauer\">Designated Survivor</a>, 24: Legacy will be the first series of 24 not to jet along on the clench-jawed motivation of Jack Bauer.</p> <p>But at least the 24 producers have had the grace to throw us a bone. It has been revealed that Carlos Bernard will be back in Legacy to revive his character Tony Almeida. \u201cBut didn\u2019t Tony die in Day Five?\u201d I hear you ask. Of course he didn\u2019t \u2013 he turned up again two years later during Day Seven. You remember, the series where he stole a weaponised pathogen to punish a man who worked for a man who worked for the president, who had ordered the murder of his wife and unborn child. You remember, the season where Jack became exposed to the same pathogen and died, before coming back to life like nothing had happened. God, I love 24.</p> <p>Anyway, if Tony Almeida can make it back into 24, maybe other peripheral characters can too. Here\u2019s my wishlist:</p> <h2>Nina Myers</h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKkBzbdiqV0\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/gKkBzbdiqV0?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>If 24: Legacy wants to really get people excited, Nina Myers should be the next original character to return. Crucial to the legend of 24, it was Nina who turned on the government and killed Jack\u2019s wife at the end of Day One. Did Jack shoot her dead halfway through the third series? Yes, but that shouldn\u2019t necessarily impede her return. A woman this evil probably doesn\u2019t even need blood.<br></p> <h2>Chase Edmunds </h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S03hbWiusUY\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/S03hbWiusUY?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>Way back in Day Three, Jack reluctantly took on a partner. This was a mistake, as that partner was Chase Edmunds, his daughter Kim\u2019s boyfriend. Things went about as well as can be expected, with Jack eventually lopping Chase\u2019s hand off with an axe. Later, we\u2019d learn that Kim had split up with Chase, after she became inconsolably grief-stricken when Jack faked his own death. Hopefully we\u2019ll meet Chase next year, sipping from the World\u2019s Least Desirable Father-In-Law mug he couldn\u2019t quite bring himself to give Jack.<br></p> <h2>President Wayne Palmer</h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qHSQioJqe4\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/5qHSQioJqe4?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p> The all-time worst 24 president. Worse than James \u201cReagan\u201d Heller. Worse than Allison \u201cClinton\u201d Taylor. Worse than Charles \u201cNixon\u201d Logan. Worse, even, than Alan \u201cAlan Dale\u201d Dale. Wayne Palmer was the younger brother of all-time greatest 24 president David Palmer, and saw to his presidency like the horny, preening berk he was. Written out of the original show after an assassination attempt left him in a coma, we should now revive Wayne purely to see what a cap-wearing, Segway-riding ninny he\u2019s grown up to be.</p> <h2>George Mason </h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frrG-1ITw_E\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/frrG-1ITw_E?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>We last saw the corrupt former CTU director detonating a nuclear blast by crashing a plane into a desert as he succumbed to a fatal dose of plutonium poisoning. But this is 24, so he definitely isn\u2019t dead. Despite his comprehensive burns, extensive injuries and near-constant facial haemorrhaging, George is still out there somewhere. Maybe he\u2019s leading an underground counterterrorism unit like Bill Buchanan. That would be nice.</p> <h2>Aaron Pierce </h2> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/may/17/24-legacy-is-already-the-best-show-of-2017-thats-a-guarantee\">24: Legacy is already the best show of 2017. That's a guarantee</a> </p> </aside>  <p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOhfU2ASyiU\">God bless you, Aaron Pierce</a>. The sole unanimous force of law-abiding good in the entire history of 24, Aaron Pierce was President Palmer\u2019s bodyguard, then President Keeler\u2019s bodyguard, then President Logan\u2019s bodyguard, then the bodyguard of President Taylor\u2019s daughter. Actually, come to think of it, this means he failed to stop two assassination attempts, another successful assassination and the presumably-fatal stabbing of a third president by his unhinged first lady, with whom he was romantically involved. God, Aaron Pierce was awful. Perhaps he should be the big baddie next year.</p> <h2>Caroline Fowlds </h2> <p>In 24: Live Another Day, all Fowlds did was mutely stand behind Prime Minister Stephen Fry and scowl a lot, like she was definitely evil. But she didn\u2019t actually do anything evil, so perhaps she can rock up during episode three of Legacy and punch Tony Almeida on the bottom or something. You know, for closure.<br></p>",

The A-Level changed everything for me, it opened up a world of history, philosophy, sociology in a way that I could get really excited about. I went on to get a First in my degree (in History of Art) and a Masters, which for someone who was never considered 'academic' is not bad going. Without that A-Level I would never have learnt that you don't have to be good at STEM subjects to be considered intelligent/academic. <br />Not everyone is built for a 'real' job (as people keep calling them); I am not good at maths/science/languages, so why force young people to take those subjects, only to do badly, have their confidence knocked, and end up in a position no better than when they started. Better to broaden their minds and give them more opportunities to study things that actually interests them. Well rounded individuals surely make for better employees?

Having taken it at A' level, I found it wasn't as easy to create flash cards, mnemonics or the other easy methods of rote learning the formulae, equations or other fixed items of knowledge necessary for maths and the sciences. The fact that one needs creativity as well as fine-tuned analytical and interpretative skills means, as a subject, it requires more cognitive depth than the so-called 'hard' subjects, which one merely digests and regurgitates in an exam. I'd challenge anyone who finds physics or maths fairly straightforward to breeze through the course and get themselves an A-grade; a 'soft' subject it is not.</p> <p>I find it deeply disappointing that this course is not available at A' level any longer; very disappointing and very depressing.

  "<h2>\u2018This scary clown thing is a huge distraction\u2019<br></h2> <p><strong>Peanut the clown, Leeds</strong><br></p> <p>I love my job! I have had 35 years of professional clowning. I consciously chose clowning when I could have become a teacher because of the creativity. I am dyslexic but I am a very good teacher so I developed my own system of teaching circus skills as an art form in schools. Over 7000 performances later I am able to work with the shyest children to get them on stage and in a circus show in two hours. It\u2019s not magic - it\u2019s just the class teacher comes with a lot of \u2018background\u2019 that I don\u2019t have. Being a clown, I get the children\u2019s attention and work with their imagination, which is the strongest part of a child\u2019s life until they get to secondary school.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Dxn9yxNmHc\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/_Dxn9yxNmHc?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>I have been aware of the \u2018killer clown\u2019 nonsense for over twenty years - since the Stephen King movie in fact. But this is new. These qualities and the cleverness of the videos that are fueling this craze appeals to children. <br></p> <p> I am so concerned by what has been happening to children in relation to clowning that I am now teaching children mindfulness in schools so they can tell the difference between real and make believe and so learn how to be happy - despite the horrors in the world.</p> <p>I think children\u2019s innocence and safety are the real issue here.</p> <h2><strong>\u2018They\u2019re using the costume, but they\u2019re not professionals\u2019</strong></h2> <p><strong>Porotto the Clown, Leon, Mexico<br></strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"44f00ad1512f69a8a0e680334a2ca1f1305bfa77\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/44f00ad1512f69a8a0e680334a2ca1f1305bfa77/0_48_640_384/500.jpg\" alt=\"Porotto performing the goldfish story for kids in Mexico.\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Porotto performing the goldfish story for kids in Mexico.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Porotto the clown</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I\u2019m from Leon city in Mexico. I studied neuropsychology, and currently work in a public library as a storyteller using clown craft. I like poetry, and adapt short stories as theatrical performances.. I look up to Slava Polunin, Rowan Atkinson, Marceau and Charlot among others. <br></p> <p>I like to read about theatrical theory and study to contextualize our work. Clowns work on human emotions: our body is poetry, and self-reflection - both for ourselves and the people who enjoy the show.. It\u2019s been said that \u201claughter is health\u201d - it\u2019s true, but a clown explores hate, fear, sadness, and certainly joy. </p> <p>There\u2019s a media culture in which clowns seem like monsters or worse. There is nothing good in Ronald McDonald, creepy films like \u201cThe Clown, or George Gaccy, the \u201cclown killer\u201d. <br></p> <p>There are peoplewho use a clown\u2019s costume, but they\u2019re not clowns. They\u2019re not professional.</p> <p>A clown isn\u2019t an actor. We\u2019re people, sharing our feelings with humor and our moods. Because the people are clowns too. Everybody should laugh at themselves.<br></p> <p>A clown is more than an artist. It\u2019s a way of life.</p> <h2>\u2018Clowns by their very nature are resilient\u2019<br></h2> <p><strong>Samantha Holdsworth<br></strong></p> <p>I am the Founder of Clowns Without Borders UK. Our clown work is unusual because we perform in crisis zones and for refugee children. We got back from performing in refugee camps in Greece last week. It\u2019s a joyful, often tough and humbling job. We have the privilege and responsibility of reminding children, in the worst of circumstances, that it\u2019s OK to be a child, we do this by making fools of ourselves. <br></p> <p>Some people might say we have no business being in crisis zones however, these moments of joy that are specifically created for children in crisis are vital and should be part of everyday life. But they are not. Every child deserves to be a child regardless of circumstances and that\u2019s why clowns are so important in this circumstances. Big NGO\u2019s call it psychosocial first aid, we call it \u2018laughter-aid\u2019.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"983ae7aa208039d06366c975525793119659ec57\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/983ae7aa208039d06366c975525793119659ec57/0_27_810_486/500.jpg\" alt=\"Clowns without Borders on a tour to Greek refugee camps.\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Clowns without Borders on a tour to Greek refugee camps.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Cowns Without Borders</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It\u2019s a compliment when people think this work is easy, it means what we\u2019re doing looks effortless, when really we\u2019ve trained for years, rehearsed routines over and over again and most importantly we are skilled at listening to our audience. You can\u2019t just walk into a complex situation and start being crazy, that would be scary! It requires a certain sensitivity. <br></p> <p>You need a gentleness that speaks to children and practice is essential. Through our clowning we are saying to the children we are here for and we care about you. It\u2019s only through this approach, which really comes from the heart, that the children can trust us and therefore let go. When that happens, anything is possible, like pretending we are all chickens and laughing together. <br></p> <p>Coulrophobia, the fear of clowns, is real and needs to be respected. This [craze] is certainly not going to help. However, there\u2019s a big difference between an actual clown and men in scary masks. I think the British public are able to discern the difference.</p> <p>Clowns by their very nature are resilient, we bounce back! We\u2019ve been around for centuries; long after these bozos in silly masks are gone we\u2019ll still be here sharing laughter and happiness.<br></p>",
  "<p>She\u2019s famous around the globe for her archaeological exploits, elegant acrobatics, and ability to take down a T rex at 20 paces. But who is the real Lara Croft? I have come to her sprawling manor home in rural Surrey to find out. </p> <p>This is, after all, the British icon who has spent the last 20 years battling wolves, giant snakes and unsupportive vest tops. Now, as I watch Lara standing at the kitchen counter, wrestling with a small foil pod, one thing becomes clear: she is not a woman who can work a Nespresso machine. \u201cOh bollocks,\u201d she says, in that familiar cut-glass accent, as coffee granules spray across the polished granite. She hurls the empty pod in the sink, whips out the pistols she keeps strapped to each thigh, and blasts the machine with both barrels. She then pops the guns neatly back in their holsters and turns, raising an eyebrow in her trademark style. \u201cTea?\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s hard to believe two decades have passed since she made her debut. The original Tomb Raider was a smash hit, selling more than 7.5m copies. It received widespread acclaim for its unique offering of atmospheric environments, intelligent puzzles, fluid controls and giant breasts. The star of the show was the game\u2019s athletic and enigmatic main character \u2013 for whom fame came as something of a shock.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c68e1f87b35477ec3dfe4787d18f38e507954e20\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c68e1f87b35477ec3dfe4787d18f38e507954e20/0_165_2048_1229/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Lara as she looked a decade ago\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lara as she looked a decade ago.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: HO/REUTERS</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cI\u2019m quite a private person,\u201d says Lara, sitting cross-legged on her rug, made from the skins of black panthers she slaughtered in her first adventure. \u201cAt the Swiss finishing school I went to, we were taught to be demure and reserved. That\u2019s why I barely say anything in the first few games, apart from \u2018No\u2019 and \u2018Argh\u2019.</p> <p>\u201cThen suddenly, there were paps outside my house. Teenage girls would turn up on my doorstep wearing turquoise vests stuffed with water balloons. I couldn\u2019t even walk round Waitrose without someone asking me where to find the second rusty key in the tomb of Tihocan. It was very strange.\u201d</p> <p>Lara wasn\u2019t just a popular video game character \u2013 she had become a cultural icon. If there was one moment that marked her transition into the mainstream consciousness, it was her appearance on the <a href=\"http://65.media.tumblr.com/dedf0275cc3e33b62692a9a9a38fd7fc/tumblr_ne3t55HpZY1rfy3d2o9_500.jpg\">cover of hip magazine The Face</a> in June 1998.</p> <p>\u201cYes, that felt like a big deal,\u201d she says. \u201cI mean, look at the other names on that cover \u2013 pioneering cultural trailblazers of the age like Gillian Anderson and Melinda Messenger. No mainstream magazine had even put a game character on the front before. I heard they could have had Natalie Imbruglia that month. It\u2019s crazy.\u201d</p> <p>A raft of Tomb Raider sequels followed, taking Lara to locations as exotic as Tibet, Atlantis and Cornwall. Today, the spoils of these adventures are casually displayed around her tastefully decorated home. The Dagger of Xian resides on an Ikea Expedit, while the Amulet of Horus hangs in the downstairs toilet, and the Spear of Destiny is used to prop open the lounge door. Thor\u2019s hammer, Mjolnir, lies abandoned next to a giant hole in the hallway. (\u201cI was trying to fix a loose floorboard,\u201d shrugs Lara.)</p> <p>But while Croft Manor is littered with these physical reminders of Lara\u2019s career highlights, there have been low points, too. When I bring up 2003 flop <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2003/aug/02/comment.games\">Angel of Darkness</a>, a shadow crosses her face, and I nervously think back to the fate of that Nespresso machine.</p> <p>\u201cI know it was all the rage at the time, but I think introducing stealth was a mistake,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd the locations were too mundane. Players liked it when I was riding motorbikes and shooting tigers in the Bolivian jungle. They absolutely did not want to see me arguing with mutant Geordies in a disused tube station.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqcJSMtonKI\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/zqcJSMtonKI?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>Angel marked the first and only appearance of potential love interest Kurtis Trent. Lara is coy about the nature of their relationship \u2013 as she is about her romantic history in general.</p> <p>\u201cKurtis meant well, but in the end I had to tell him it was never going to work,\u201d says Lara. \u201cHe was always losing things \u2013 there were so many pockets on those bloody combat trousers, he couldn\u2019t ever remember where he\u2019d put his keys, or his wallet, or his ridiculous giant ninja star. It was really annoying.\u201d</p> <p>Trousers can\u2019t have been the only factor in the failure of their relationship. So what was the real reason Lara rejected Kurtis? Did he struggle to live in the shadow of such a strong, powerful woman? Or was she reluctant to compromise her fierce attachment to a fully independent existence?</p> <p>\u201cIt was his beard,\u201d she says. \u201cI mean, it was just rubbish, wasn\u2019t it? Like a sort of pixie\u2019s minge.\u201d Fair enough.</p> <p>Despite its failings, Angel<em> </em>didn\u2019t mark the end of Lara\u2019s career by any means. She made a triumphant return in 2006 with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2006/feb/23/games.newmedia\">Legend</a><em>,</em> which was followed by the successful <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2008/nov/21/tomb-raider-underworld-lara-croft\">Underworld</a> and blockbuster remake Anniversary. But just like other trendsetting icons, such as Madonna or Peter Andre, Lara has always looked for ways to reinvent herself and stay relevant. So in 2013, the series got a reboot, with a game simply titled <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/gamesblog/2013/mar/01/tomb-raider-video-game-review\">Tomb Raider</a>.</p> <p>This offering aimed to take the franchise in a sophisticated new direction, telling Lara\u2019s origins story, explaining her motivations and revealing her more human, vulnerable side. It did this by having her violently murder loads of people within the first four minutes.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m proud of that game. It was time for the series to mature, to move on,\u201d she says. \u201cBut yes, there was probably a bit too much murder.\u201d</p> <p>Following the reboot, and 2016 follow-up <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/nov/11/rise-of-the-tomb-raider-review-lara-croft\">Rise of the Tomb Raider</a>, a whole new generation is discovering Lara Croft. I envy them that thrill as I think back to the first time I encountered her, 20 years ago. I have yet to meet a female gamer of around my age (young 39) who does not remember the original series as a momentous and formative part of their gaming history, and even their personal development. It was as influential during my own journey from girl to woman as other cultural touchstones such as The Bell Jar, The Female Eunuch, and <a href=\"https://youtu.be/UyE7pw3vKhE\">Joey from Blossom</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6890b05afcd00af958c76838ddff4ff37c5a66ec\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6890b05afcd00af958c76838ddff4ff37c5a66ec/86_0_1280_768/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Lara meeting a fan in Rise of the Tomb Raider\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lara meeting a fan in Rise of the Tomb Raider</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Handout</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>However, as significant as Lara\u2019s presence in games was (and remains), two decades on she is still the only truly iconic female character out there. During the same period we\u2019ve seen the rise to fame of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/sep/07/metal-gear-solid-everything-you-need-to-know-about-entire-series\">Solid Snake</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/nov/12/halo-master-chief-collection-review\">Master Chief</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/apr/07/nathan-drake-uncharted-4-naughty-dog\">Nathan Drake</a> and many more male heroes. So where are their female equivalents?</p> <p>\u201cThey may not be receiving the recognition they deserve, but there are women doing great work out there,\u201d says Lara. \u201cLook at Ellie from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/feb/17/last-of-us-left-behind-review\">The Last of Us</a>, or Faith from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/jun/06/mirrors-edge-catalyst-review-ea-dice\">Mirror\u2019s Edge</a>, or ... Ellie from <em>The Last of Us</em>. What about that one in Street Fighter with the spinning knickers kick? Yes, there is probably room for more.\u201d</p> <p>In the meantime, at least we have Ms Croft. And she\u2019s never looked better, thanks to the latest title\u2019s high definition graphics, incredibly realistic animations, and breasts of a size that could feasibly belong to an actual human in real life without making them topple over. But is she still the same Lara on the inside?</p> <p>\u201cI think so. Where\u2019s he put the bloody milk?\u201d she says, rummaging in the fridge. \u201cSorry - I locked the butler in the walk-in freezer again for a laugh. Never gets old.</p> <p>\u201cAnyway. Yes, I\u2019m still motivated by the same things \u2013 the desire to explore, to discover, to pilfer rare artefacts that do weird stuff. If I get to do a bit of murder along the way, and perhaps evade a man with a dodgy foreign accent and a suspicious hat, so much the better.\u201d</p> <p>So where will Lara\u2019s taste for adventure take her next? The mysterious deserts of Egypt? The icy wastelands of Antarctica? Some long-forgotten temple in the heart of the Cambodian jungle?</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m off to Argos,\u201d she says. \u201cI need a new Nespresso machine.\u201d</p> <ul> <li>Ellie Gibson can currently be seen on <a href=\"http://dave.uktv.co.uk/shows/dara-o-briains-go-8-bit/\">Dara O Briain\u2019s Go 8 Bit</a>, on Dave TV.

increases to offset rising costs were a normal part of doing business. \u201cWe are taking price increases in the UK. That is a normal devaluation-led cycle,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>He said he was confident the dispute would be \u201cresolved pretty quickly\u201d.</p> \n<p>The UK accounts for less than 5% of Unilever\u2019s business, Pitkethly said, as the company announced better than expected quarterly results after pushing through price increases around the world. The company posted underlying sales growth of 3.2% for the past three months, ahead of analysts\u2019 expectations.</p> \n<p>UK consumers, however, have been told to brace themselves for price rises. Pinar Hosafci, a senior food analyst at Euromonitor International, said: \u201cBrexit has been a trigger that started this and it is likely that other companies, which are reporting in euros, including the likes of Nestl\u00e9 and Ferrero, will follow suit. This move could be more detrimental to Tesco than Unilever, which owns a number of power brands that are either leading or at best ranking in the second place.\u201d</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/shortcuts/2016/feb/15/why-the-spanish-love-tea-marmite-and-cathedral-city-cheddar\">Why the Spanish love tea, Marmite and Cathedral City cheddar</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>The <a href=\"http://brc.org.uk/\">British Retail Consortium</a> said shops would be doing their best to hold down prices for customers, but that the impact of the falling pound would eventually work its way through to shelf prices.

  "<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/jose-mourinho\" title=\"\">Jos\u00e9 Mourinho</a> is only four years older than <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/jurgen-klopp\" title=\"\">J\u00fcrgen Klopp</a> but in football terms it can feel as though there is a lifetime between them. In part it is an issue of tactics: the hard, high press of which Klopp is such a devotee is modish. When <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/liverpool\" title=\"\">Liverpool</a> and Manchester City went to Tottenham this season and engaged in breathless, percussive styles, it felt like the football of today, the freshest ideas being pitched against each other. Mourinho\u2019s style is more conventional. That does not render it invalid but, with the two managers\u2019 sides poised to meet at Anfield on Monday night, it is part of a general sense of familiarity about the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/manchester-united\" title=\"\">Manchester United</a> manager that may be damaging.</p> <p>The great Argentinian coach Carlos Bianchi, who won four Copa Libertadores with V\u00e9lez Sarsfield and Boca Juniors, once laid out 10 \u201cunwritten rules\u201d of successful coaching for the magazine Management Deportivo. Not a single one of them referred to on-pitch strategy. For him the most important thing was to cultivate \u201c<em>el liderazgo</em>\u201d. The term literally means \u201cleadership\u201d but for Bianchi it was more than that \u2013 it was about developing a cult of personality. It is a strategy at least partially shared by Mourinho and Klopp.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/oct/03/jose-mourinho-manchester-united-how-has-he-fared-so-far\">Jos\u00e9 Mourinho\u2019s Manchester United: how has he fared so far? | Jamie Jackson</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Klopp is warm and charismatic. To see him celebrating on the pitch after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/16/chelsea-liverpool-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">the 2-1 win at Stamford Bridge this season</a> was to see a manager who is clearly loved both by his players and by the vast majority of Liverpool fans. His antics on the touchline, his obvious involvement in the game, make clear he is one of them. His manner in press conferences and interviews is convivial but there is a structure to his spontaneity. Watch him do a line of television interviews and you realise even the exclamations of \u201cHa!\u201d are to an extent pre-programmed. That is not to accuse him of hypocrisy or to suggest there is anything dishonest about his public persona but it is a performance geared to making certain points and achieving a certain effect.</p> <p>Talk to anybody who played for Mourinho at Porto and it can feel like talking to members of a cult. There is affection but also awe. \u201cHe knew everybody so deeply that he could control our emotions in every situation,\u201d said the goalkeeper V\u00edtor Ba\u00eda, who described how Mourinho\u2019s planning was so precise that at times it seemed as though he could foretell the future. In <a href=\"https://www.theblizzard.co.uk/product/issue-eight/\" title=\"\">issue eight of The Blizzard</a>, Roy Henderson outlined how closely Mourinho conforms to German political theorist Max Weber\u2019s definition of the \u201ccharismatic authority\u201d needed by demagogues. The line about being a \u201cSpecial One\u201d is a case in point: he knew the media would pick it up and that it added to the image he wanted to present of self-confidence and control.</p> <p>For managers who rely on <em>el liderazgo</em>, the problem comes when the aura is punctured. As the former Benfica coach B\u00e9la Guttmann once observed, a coach is like a lion-tamer: \u201cThe moment he becomes unsure of his hypnotic energy, and the first hint of fear appears in his eyes, he is lost.\u201d</p> <p>This season Mourinho, rumpled and grouchy, has at times seemed hesitant, bereft of the ruthlessness of old. Worse, when he has been ruthless, as he was in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/aug/26/bastian-schweinsteiger-jose-mourinho-manchester-united\" title=\"\">his treatment of Bastian Schweinsteiger</a>, it felt like a trick. There is resignation rather than shock: Mourinho doing his thing again. His interviews and press conferences no longer have the same impact: the same strategies recur and rather than report the outrage they are designed to provoke, the media now focus on the strategy.</p> <p>The demand for constant evolution is wearying. Very few managers manage more than a decade at the very highest level and those who do often have a fallow period \u2013 as, for instance, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/sir-alex-ferguson\" title=\"\">Sir Alex Ferguson</a> did between 2003 and 2006. Mourinho is a coach of extraordinary gifts. He may find a way back to the top as he did, exhaustingly and self\u2011destructively, in Madrid by beating Barcelona <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2012/may/03/real-madrid-title-la-liga\" title=\"\">to La Liga title in 2012</a>. But at the moment it feels as though the momentum is against the Portuguese and, for a coach whose method is so based on perception, that is a major&#xa0;concern.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/oct/07/jurgen-klopp-liverpool-energy-giver\">J\u00fcrgen Klopp: the \u2018energy giver\u2019 who made Liverpool believe again | Andy Hunter</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Last season, although United got the better of Liverpool in both league games, there was a sense that Klopp represented modernity and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/louis-van-gaal\" title=\"\">Louis van Gaal</a> something more traditional. One was vertical, the other horizontal, the difference between the two demonstrated as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/mar/10/liverpool-manchester-united-europa-league-match-report\" title=\"\">a rampant Liverpool beat United 2-0</a> in the home leg of their Europa League tie.</p> <p>There is little sense that anything has changed this season. United may be less conservative than they were under Van Gaal but they still seem sluggish by comparison with City, Spurs or Liverpool. Perhaps that is, as Mourinho has claimed, simply a case of him having to re-educate players encumbered by Van Gaal\u2019s indoctrination (resistant as they seemed to his philosophy at the time).</p> <p>But stylistically, since his first spell at Chelsea at least, Mourinho has stood alone, a brooding breakwater against the press-and-possess tide. And that, too, may count against his <em>el liderazgo</em>: when the image of leadership is paramount, style and substance, reputation and actuality, go hand in hand. There was a time when Mourinho\u2019s talk of resting with the ball, of transitions and midfield triangles seemed thrillingly new. He was the iconoclastic pioneer of a new age.</p> <p>But football has moved on. Klopp is modernity and that inflates his image. Mourinho, dulled by familiarity, is in danger of becoming the past.</p>",

We are Liberty students who are disappointed with President Falwell\u2019s endorsement and are tired of being associated with one of the worst presidential candidates in American history. Donald Trump does not represent our values and we want nothing to do with him.</p> <p>A majority of Liberty students, faculty, and staff feel as we do. Donald Trump received a pitiful 90 votes from Liberty students in Virginia\u2019s primary election, a colossal rejection of his campaign. Nevertheless, President Falwell eagerly uses his national platform to advocate for Donald Trump. While he occasionally clarifies that supporting Trump is not the official position of Liberty University, he knows it is his title of president of the largest Christian university in the world that gives him political credentials.</p> <p>Associating any politician with Christianity is damaging to the Gospel of Jesus Christ. But Donald Trump is not just any politician. He has made his name by maligning others and bragging about his sins. Not only is Donald Trump a bad candidate for president, he is actively promoting the very things that we as Christians ought to oppose.</p> <p>A recently uncovered tape revealed his comments bragging about sexually assaulting women. Any faculty or staff member at Liberty would be terminated for such comments, and yet when Donald Trump makes them, President Falwell rushes eagerly to his defense \u2013 taking the name \u201cLiberty University\u201d with him. \u201cWe\u2019re all sinners,\u201d Falwell told the media, as if sexual assault is a shoulder-shrugging issue rather than an atrocity which plagues college campuses across America, including our own.</p> <p>It is not enough to criticize these kinds of comments. We must make clear to the world that while everyone is a sinner and everyone can be forgiven, a man who constantly and proudly speaks evil does not deserve our support for the nation\u2019s highest office.</p> <p>Jesus tells a story in the Bible about a man who tries to remove a speck of dust from his brother\u2019s eye, while he has a log stuck in his own. \u201cYou hypocrite,\u201d Jesus says, \u201cfirst take the log out of your own eye, and then you will see clearly to take the speck out of your brother\u2019s eye.\u201d</p> <p>We Liberty students are often told to support Donald Trump because the other leading candidate is a bad option. Perhaps this is true. But the only candidate who is directly associated with Liberty University is Donald Trump.</p> <p>Because our president has led the world to believe that Liberty University supports Donald Trump, we students must take it upon ourselves to make clear that Donald Trump is absolutely opposed to what we believe, and does not have our support.</p> <p>We are not proclaiming our opposition to Donald Trump out of bitterness, but out of a desire to regain the integrity of our school. While our president Jerry Falwell Jr. tours the country championing the log in his eye, we want the world to know how many students oppose him. We don\u2019t want to champion Donald Trump; we want only to be champions for Christ.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57feda24e4b03b22b4fb2c62\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-13T00:50:44.194Z\">1.50am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The Clinton campaign has responded to Trump campaign advisor Roger Stone\u2019s statements that he has had \u201cback-channel communications\u201d with Wikileaks, the organization that has released hacked documents and emails from the DNC and Clinton campaign.</p> <p>\u201cIt is disturbing that Roger Stone, a longtime Donald Trump confidante, has confirmed the fact that has \u2018back-channel communications\u2019 with Wikileaks, an organization that is working with the Russian government to affect the American presidential election,\u201d said Glen Caplin.</p> <p>\u201cIt is also now clear that the illegal hack of John Podesta\u2019s email is the work of the Russian government, according to the FBI.

That would be smart \u2013 but we don\u2019t run government smart.\u201d</p> <p>In a bizarre aside, Trump even took on the NFL over its new regulations to limit concussions. \u201cA little ding in the head you can\u2019t play the rest of the season,\u201d he said mockingly.</p> <p>But the Democratic candidate remained his primary target. \u201cIt\u2019s a choice between the pessimism of Hillary Clinton and the optimism of a movement powered by millions of people all over the country...

If Clinton wins, meaning Vice-President Tim Kaine would hold the casting vote in the Senate, meaning the Democrats would only need to pick up four seats to control the upper chamber. The Republicans currently have 54 Senate seats, and the Democrats 44, along with two independents who caucus with them.</p> <p>In two tight Senate contests, Nevada and New Hampshire, GOP candidates on Saturday announced they could no longer stomach Trump, and called on him to withdraw. On Monday, the House speaker, Paul Ryan, fired another salvo at Trump by saying he would no longer campaign for him or defend him, and told members they should feel free to focus on their own survival.</p> <p>\u201cI think Republicans were feeling pretty good about the Congress a couple weeks ago, but this morning they\u2019re very worried,\u201d former representative Vin Weber told the Guardian on Monday. Weber has helped raise funds for a politically-active non-profit, the American Action Network, and an allied Super Pac, the Congressional Leadership Fund, that are trying to keep the GOP majority.

  "<p>Snaking down forested hairpin bends towards the finish, just 61 riders remain from 201, most beaten down by a gruelling 240km and multiple climbs across some of Italy\u2019s most challenging but beautiful terrain. Dubbed \u201cla classica delle foglie morte\u201d (the race of the falling/dying leaves), the <a href=\"http://www.ilombardia.it/en/\">Giro Di Lombardia</a> recently completed its 110th edition. </p> <p>This year it traversed the glimmering waters of Lake Como before climbing up through cobbles into the ancient walled section of Citta Alta in Bergamo, where buildings glow orange, brown, red and in the autumn light. A sprint finish in the town\u2019s main square saw Italy\u2019s Diego Rosa tearfully beaten to the line by the ever-smiling Colombian Esteban Chaves, the first non-European ever to triumph here.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=py1MNjK30rw\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/py1MNjK30rw?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>Highlights of this year\u2019s Giro Di Lombardia, where there were only 61 finishers out of 201 riders.</figcaption> </figure>   <p>Win this prestigious pro race and your reputation is set in stone. The giro is broadcast live on Italian national TV and is a key international event for riders, sponsors and teams to cement places for next season. Past multiple champions include Fausto Coppi, Eddy Merckx, Alfredo Binda, Sean Kelly and Bernard Hinault. </p> <p>Earlier that same day, much slower, I also rode part of the course. To go in full Italian style, I wore a Santini jersey, and borrowed a super-slick SK Pininfarina model from one of the region\u2019s great bike makers, De Rosa. I was guided by a couple of old professionals, the nippy Paolo Lanfranchi (a stage winner in the 2000 Giro d\u2019Italia) and beefy Ermanno Brignoli, a powerhouse who helped Marco Pantini to his Tour De France and Giro D\u2019Italia 1998 double.

If ever cycling is a religion, it is here, where riders come to light a candle and pay their respects.

British cycling is growing at a rapid rate with new talent and a raft of new customers with money to spend, France might be remain focus point of pro road racing, but Italy still has a strong claim to be a spiritual home, where it is still a working-class sport. But to get under the skin of Italy\u2019s riding, I decided to also literally wear it. I visited another local Bergamo company, <a href=\"http://www.santinisms.it/en/\">Santini</a>, creators of 50 years of classic Italian and other jerseys. </p> <p>Set up by Pietro Santini and his three sisters in 1965 and now run by his smiling but sharply savvy daughters Monica and Paola, Santini is a true family firm, where 85% of the staff are women and everything is designed and manufactured under one roof, avoiding outsourcing to keep top-quality control. Materials are sourced only from other local firms, and contracts are completed for clubs, UCI pro teams and include the coveted world champion rainbow jersey. Creative director Fergus Niland shows me round the factory. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4489c67f6e548bd0c1381ac1ba30490fc61f6d99\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4489c67f6e548bd0c1381ac1ba30490fc61f6d99/73_63_1290_776/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Detail of Santini\u2019s 2016 Giro Di Lombardia jersey colours, featuring the iconic dying leaves, designed by Fergus Niland\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Detail of Santini\u2019s 2016 Giro Di Lombardia jersey colours, featuring the iconic dying leaves, designed by Fergus Niland.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Fergus Niland/Santini</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Like an art gallery of the sport, classic designs hang everywhere, in Merino wool to the latest sleek materials, Raleigh-Campagnelo to L\u2019Eroica. Has jersey manufacture changed over the years? Pietro, now 74, is still in the office each day, and is full of fabulous cycling stories. He is modestly mates with all the greats. Back in the days of Merckx and co, he says, cyclists weren\u2019t so interested in what they wore. Now it is an obsession. </p> <p>The science of wind resistance is pushing the boundaries, so every pro must be precisely fitted, wearing kits that normal riders might find very uncomfortable. While your average rider might want to look good while having a coffee, the pros are only interested in performance in the cycling position, regardless of whether it\u2019s ill-fitting off the bike. Could this be like supersonic jet planes that, when in the hangar, tended to leaked oil, but when in the air, expanded to have perfect skin for speed? The Santinis agree it\u2019s exactly like this.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"137c86e61a3b48a8ff6bd5b77db775ae0e1f2206\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/137c86e61a3b48a8ff6bd5b77db775ae0e1f2206/0_0_4320_2880/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Some of the many treasures at Santini, the bike clothing company in Bergamo, Italy\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Some of the many treasures at Santini, leading bike clothing company in Bergamo, Italy.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Peter Kimpton</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Have any of their customers been especially difficult? Instantly one is named \u2013 Mario Cipollini. The 90s Italian sprinter notorious for wearing zebra, tiger and muscle suits was apparently never happy with his kit because he claimed to already have the perfect body. Germany\u2019s Erik Zabel however, was \u201calways friendly and hugged me after races\u201d. Some cyclists however have been very picky on detail, but helpful in pushing the industry and technology further, such Greg LeMond, or Anna Meares. Where next for cycling kit? The female market is rapidly expanding.</p> <p>From <em>primi</em> to podium, riding or taking in the flavours and culture of this historic race, I leave feeling an Italian job may be among the most beautiful in cycling.</p>",
  "<p>Although the west\u2019s appetite for witch-hunting has long been sated, the urge to persecute has not, which explains why the idea remains so useful. Politicians and celebrities and journalists use the term \u201cwitch-hunt\u201d all the time. In March this year the blogger Craig Charles Haley described \u201csocial media witch-hunts\u201d as \u201c<a href=\"http://www.thatsnonsense.com/social-media-witch-hunts-why-you-need-to-avoid-them/\" title=\"\">witch-hunts on steroids</a>\u201d. Accusations go viral, globally, within hours, and \u201cinstead of having dozens of angry voices baying for your blood\u201d, writes Haley, \u201cyou have tens of thousands\u201d. Typically the accusers are cowardly, ignorant, offensive and openly misogynistic. When the historian Mary Beard appeared on BBC\u2019s Question Time, she received <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/jan/26/mary-beard-question-time-internet-trolls\" title=\"\">torrents of abuse</a> from internet trolls, less about what she had said than about how she looks.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/jan/26/mary-beard-question-time-internet-trolls\">Mary Beard: I almost didn't feel such generic, violent misogyny was about me</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In the victimisation of public figures like Beard, we instantly recognise the witch-hunting paradigm: a mob pointing at an older woman, exposed in public and outspoken. But what, historically, are we referring to? Haley assumes we know. A witch-hunt was \u201cthe search for those people \u2013 usually solitary women \u2013 suspected of witchcraft, guided by panic, misinformation and misunderstanding\u201d. Without pretence to a fair hearing, \u201ccommunities would execute their suspects\u201d on the thinnest proof.</p> <p>Yet much of what we know, from folklore and fiction, is wrong. Robert Eggers\u2019 horror movie, <a href=\"https://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=6&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0ahUKEwinqdecxdLPAhVKsBQKHRIGApoQFghBMAU&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Ffilm%2Fthe-witch&amp;usg=AFQjCNGL-31vKdU45xPaFo-CGMyiHmWDtg&amp;sig2=xk4yWAxrfYdF5aC0NlCPBw\" title=\"\">The Witch</a>, set in New England in 1630, examines a family in the wilderness, afraid of what lurks in the woods. Eggers gives us a real witch, fleetingly glimpsed yet malevolently near. However, most real suspected witches were not isolated figures hounded by their communities. They were integrated and proximate, and all the more scary for that. Accusations involved personal relationships and intense emotions rather than random scapegoating.</p> <p>There were some savage purges in the 17th century. Between 1616 and 1630, the German cities of Bamberg and W\u00fcrzburg burned more than 2,000 witches. <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/legacies/myths_legends/england/essex/article_1.shtml\" title=\"\">Matthew Hopkins</a>, the infamous \u201cWitchfinder General\u201d \u2013 who is the <a href=\"https://www.thedungeons.com/london/en/plan-your-visit/the-witch-hunter.aspx\" title=\"\">subject of a new immersive experience</a> at the London Dungeon \u2013 orchestrated an English witch-hunt in the 1640s that claimed 100 lives, and Scotland saw similar outbursts. On the whole, though, crazes that sucked in scores of innocents were the exception which proved the rule, namely that the toxic brew of a witchcraft prosecution followed a specific recipe of religious belief, legal opportunity and uncomfortable social intimacy.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>In one three-week period, the words \u2018slut' and \u2018whore' had been directed at 6,500 unique Twitter users in 10,000 tweets</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>It\u2019s a myth that millions of innocent women were persecuted by male lawyers and clerics as a means of social control. We know of about 110,000 witch trials between 1450 and 1750, six of which have recently been commemorated with temporary \u201cdark plaques\u201d in London. This may seem like a lot, but over 300 years and millions of women, it is not so great a total. Nor were accusations tantamount to death sentences: half of the trials ended in acquittal because courts were wary of executing blameless people on dubious evidence. This is why there were fewer trials than many suppose. If witch-hunting was a way of getting rid of people, or explaining misfortune, it wasn\u2019t a very good one.</p> <p>So is \u201cwitch-hunting\u201d an appropriate label for what <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/mar/05/so-youve-been-publicly-shamed-jon-ronson-review\" title=\"\">Jon Ronson has called</a> \u201cthe great renaissance in public shaming\u201d? Let\u2019s turn to gender. Pre-modern societies were patriarchal, and most suspected witches female, their accusers male. Yet one in five convicted witches was male. Men could be witches in exactly the same way as women \u2013 there were just fewer. Even more interesting is the proportion of witnesses against witches who were women \u2013 women who believed themselves, or often their children, to be bewitched. Our female ancestors were keen students of each another\u2019s reputations, and competed ruthlessly to protect themselves and their households, and to denounce others.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2015/dec/20/social-media-twitter-online-shame\">Jon Ronson: How the online hate mob set its sights on me</a> </p> </aside>  <p>And how do things look today? Misogyny thrives. A recently published study by the thinktank Demos revealed that in one three-week period in the UK, the words \u201cslut\u201d and \u201cwhore\u201d had been directed at <a href=\"http://www.demos.co.uk/press-release/staggering-scale-of-social-media-misogyny-mapped-in-new-demos-study/\" title=\"\">6,500 unique Twitter users</a> in 10,000 tweets. It\u2019s striking that half these cyber-bullies were women. This is alarming, but we shouldn\u2019t confuse new media with old messages. Most lawsuits for defamation, hidden in the archives, involve sexual slander using words like \u201cwhore\u201d and \u201cwitch\u201d, and often both plaintiff and defendant were female. The big difference is that these enemies knew each other.</p> <p>Perhaps we shouldn\u2019t linger too long on the perpetrators. What about the victims? In some witch-hunts every suspect was a woman, and overall the proportion was 80%. The Bible taught that women were \u201cthe weaker vessel\u201d, and therefore more vulnerable to diabolic temptation. Physicians saw female bodies as leaky, corrupt, rebellious.</p> <p>And just as then so, too, are most victims of cyber-bullying female. Perhaps, as with so many prejudices we think we\u2019ve abandoned, some of this is hardwired into us. According to Alex Krasodomski-Jones, a researcher at Demos, the digital age creates \u201cnew battlegrounds of the worst aspects of human behaviour\u201d. But it\u2019s this human essence that should worry us, as much as the means by which it\u2019s manifested.</p>",

It was believed to be similarly overrepresented in juvenile centres, but no specific study had been undertaken.</p> <p>Conductive hearing loss was \u201cendemic\u201d in Aboriginal communities across the Northern Territory and arose from untreated middle ear disease in childhood, \u201ca disease very much of disadvantage\u201d, Howard said.</p> <p>In response Aboriginal youths were much more \u201cgestural\u201d in communication and picked up physical and visual codes of communication from family and community members, the commission heard.</p> <p>These were disrupted when removed from home communities and placed in child protection and detention.</p> <p>Hearing loss had an impact at all stages of a child\u2019s interaction with education, protection and justice systems, the witnesses said.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/oct/12/indigenous-groups-must-be-involved-in-policy-that-affects-them-inquiry-hears\">Indigenous groups must be involved in policy that affects them, inquiry hears</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The apparent lack of attention, focus, or communication with authority figures in schools and other facilities could be misinterpreted as defiant behaviour and often misdiagnosed as ADHD, they said.</p> <p>Further complications arose with the concept of \u201cgratuitous concurrence\u201d where people agreed with a proposition put them \u2013 including in police interviews and court \u2013 out of politeness, or out of embarrassment that they didn\u2019t understand or hear the question properly.</p> <p>Barney said the intervention needed in this space was about 10 to 15 years overdue.</p> <p>Across Australia there are only four people, including Barney, able to act as deaf Indigenous interpreters, and only one in the Northern Territory.</p> <p>Howard said recommendations he had previously made were \u201cstill current and largely had not been addressed in any way\u201d.</p> <p>He said his recommendations called for police and others in the criminal justice system communicating with Indigenous people to be aware that most people were likely to have hearing loss, and to be trained in communication processes.</p> <p>\u201cThe FASD issue, together with the evidence that we have had this afternoon about deafness throws such a complexion upon the participation of so many of these children in the criminal justice system, not to mention the child protection system, that we need to look at this carefully,\u201d commissioner Margaret White said at the end of the day.</p> <p>Earlier on Thursday the commission heard evidence from the co-author of a board of inquiry report into child protection, who said t<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/oct/13/nt-child-protection-cases-rose-sharply-due-to-lack-of-funding-for-support-services\">he NT government could have stopped the exponential rise in notifications</a> if it had implemented their recommendations.</p> <p>Muriel Bamblett told the commission there should be a designated Aboriginal children\u2019s commissioner, an Aboriginal child care agency and an Aboriginal child welfare service.</p> <p>The commission continues with community consultation meetings on Friday.

But since you\u2019re asking, here\u2019s my own list of proposed solutions for better social work:</p> <h2><strong>Reinstate additional support</strong></h2> <p>Workers without a social work qualification could assist with the increasing demands of casework. At the start of my career, it was common to have two social work assistants within any social work team. Now these posts have generally become extinct. But tasks such as completing minutes, driving service users to appointments and labelling envelopes could be completed by individuals without a social work qualification, freeing up time for more meaningful service user contact.</p> <h2><strong>Let senior staff have a hand in daily practice</strong></h2> <p>Senior management (including directors) should be working on at least one case at all times, so they fully understand the system they are accountable for.<br></p> <p>If managers were able to directly experience the IT system, the duplication of work and the admin tasks expected of social workers, I suspect progress could be made immediately. It is likely that this direct experience would challenge, and surprise, those at the top.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/social-care-network/2016/jun/29/whats-the-role-of-social-work-to-help-individuals-or-change-society\">What's the role of social work: to change society or to help individuals?</a> </p> </aside>  <h2><strong>Allow whistleblowing without fear </strong></h2> <p>Social work reform groups express concerns about the consequences of whistleblowing.

I have seen the amount of pressure applied by senior managers to toe the line at inspections: there is an excessive amount of communication to staff dictating exactly what should be conveyed and said. Instead, there should be an opportunity for Ofsted to meet frontline social workers as part of a confidential feedback session.</p> <h2><strong>Make an effort to retain experienced staff</strong></h2> <p>It\u2019s important to retain experienced staff, rather than allowing them to burn out and constantly replenishing the workforce. </p> <p>But I am concerned by the recommendations to solve this put forward by the chief social worker for children, Isabelle Trowler, in the government\u2019s <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201617/cmselect/cmeduc/201/201.pdf\">recent social work reform report</a>. She suggests local authorities with good retention rates share their experiences. This is a simplistic resolution and does not address endemic and abusive working practices in the field.</p> <h2><strong>Uphold workers\u2019 rights </strong></h2> <p>In the social work reform report and in previous guidance there are clear expectations identified regarding an employer\u2019s responsibility to social workers. But the compulsion for local authorities to abide by these conditions is flimsy and isn\u2019t explicit in employment law.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>But there must be a clear process where employees can report unjust working practices. Any guidance set out by the government is needs to be legally binding and enforceable.</p> <h2><strong>Provide emotional support</strong></h2> <p>Social workers face challenging and bewildering experiences every day and supervision alone is sometimes not enough to cope with the severe emotional and physical events that are part of the job. </p> <p>More creative thinking must be applied to improving the emotional health of the workforce. I suggest that immediate access to counselling or therapy following particularly disturbing events should always be available. There must be no shame in acknowledging the impact of the harrowing work we experience.</p> <h2><strong> Remember</strong><strong> the bigger picture</strong></h2> <p>A culture must be developed in which individual social workers are not blamed for systemic failings. In some disciplinary processes, there is often little regard for the working environment of individual social workers. </p> <p>If social workers don\u2019t adhere to statutory guidelines, of course accountability for that must be brought.However, if a social worker is unable to meet rigid timescales due to their overwhelming workload, senior managers must accept responsibility.</p> <h2><strong>Counter bad press with the truth</strong></h2> <p>When unfair media reports are made of social work, I believe the government has a moral duty to investigate and respond with a more accurate analysis and portrayal of the decisions made.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>While the social work reform report recognises that negative media portrayal must be challenged, it doesn\u2019t say how. Rather than politicians jumping upon the \u201csocial work battering train\u201d perhaps they could present a more objective view of this complicated area of work.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/social-care-network/social-life-blog/2016/aug/24/social-worker-paperwork-solution\">Are you a social worker drowning in paperwork? Here's a solution</a> </p> </aside>  <h2><strong>Be honest about the workload</strong></h2> <p>Business consultants could be a useful here. Let\u2019s start understanding the actual amount of time it takes to complete specific pieces of work. Arbitrary numbers relating to caseloads are not acceptable and don\u2019t reflect the intensity of some situations.<br></p> <p>Let consultants evaluate social work, speaking to workers to help provide an objective answer about the number of hours required for each piece of work. This could lead to a caseload management system that accurately reflects the modern social work world. </p> <h2><strong>Listen to us</strong></h2> <p> The government and local authority managers must \u201cactively listen\u201d \u2013 seeking views is not enough. Please let\u2019s change the culture of viewing social workers as idealistic moaners and recognise that this academically able and multi-talented group of professionals can help transform and guide future reforms.</p> <p>The government must understand the monumental and emotionally charged role we deliver, start talking to the frontline workers and start to listen to the abundant surveys, research, literature and anecdotal evidence available to shape a more successful future.</p> <p>\u2022 <em>Sophie Ayers is a social worker in child protection and court work</em></p> <p><em>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/social-care-network/social-life-blog\">Social Life Blog</a> is written by people who work in or use social care services.

Israel has long claimed that the global campaign calling for it to be held to account for its violations of human rights and international law occupation is seeking to hold Israel to a different standard than that expected of other nations \u2013 and in doing so questions the motivations of advocates of the campaign. The opposite is true.</p> <p>The call is for Israel to be treated like other nations, and for it to abide by the same rules. The rules that Fifa applied to clubs in Northern Cyprus and South Ossetia, among others, who are excluded from competition, should now be applied to the IFA. Any other decision would represent a fundamental violation of the principle that makes football so popular: that we are all equal under the law and all play under the same set of rules.</p>",

In effect, it is a tax increase by stealth. For example, a person earning $79,000 who got a 2% wage rise to $80,580, goes from paying a marginal tax rate of 32.5% to 37%.</p> <p>But we need a bit of context. They would only be paying 37% tax for the $579 they earned above $80,001. The rest would be unchanged.</p> <p>The tax changes mean that now instead of going into a higher tax bracket, this person would remain with a tax rate of 32.5%. It makes a difference of $26 a year less in tax.</p> <p><strong>The biggest tax cut anyone will get is those who earn over $87,001 \u2013 they will get a cut of $315 a year, or $6 a week.</strong></p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-10-13T01:38:59.266Z\">at 2.38am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57fed892e4b03b22b4fb2c5b\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-13T00:46:05.660Z\">1.46am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p> I told you there has been a storm of legislation.<br></p> <p>*1 <strong>MR PORTER</strong> <strong>:</strong> To present a bill for an act to amend the law relating to social security, and for related purposes.

Let me recap for those who do not follow for the full day. (You are only human.) </p> <p>There was a Labor amendment to an international tax bill moved by <strong>Andrew Leigh</strong>. The financial services minister, <strong>Kelly O\u2019Dwyer</strong>, was in the chair, which means she was in charge on the government side with the usual staffers. The Speaker in the chair called for the vote and the government waved it through. As O\u2019Dwyer left the chamber, Leigh thanked the government for voting for a Labor amendment and only then did it dawn on the Coalition what just happened. </p> <p><strong>The manager of opposition business, Tony Burke</strong>, was up on his feet, making hay while the sun shone.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Let\u2019s make clear what it is that was carried unanimously in this room today.

He told <strong>Kieran Gilbert</strong> on Sky:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>If it was an ordinary administrative error, it would have happened sometime in the last century. It hasn\u2019t.</p> </blockquote> <p>A point he made on Twitter straight after the vote.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/Tony_Burke/status/786103414199574528\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Today for the first time in the history of Federation an Opposition second reading amendment was carried.<br>This was not the government&#39;s plan</p>&mdash; Tony Burke (@Tony_Burke) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Tony_Burke/status/786103414199574528\">October 12, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>I spoke to Burke straight afterwards to confirm it because not even the live minutes of the house recorded the fact. No one was ready for it.</p> <p>Labor allowed the government to amend the vote after it had made its point and events continued to the adjournment. The truth is Labor is very good at this procedural stuff, having survived the hung parliament. It knows how to run a tight parliamentary ship and thus, it can identify the weak points.</p> <p>Onwards and upwards. Today we see the introduction of the bills which reform Vocational Education and Training sector. There are three bills associated:</p> <ul> <li> VET student loans<br></li> <li>VET student loans (consequential amendments and transitional provisions)<br></li> <li>VET student loans (charges)<br></li> </ul> <p>The education minister, <strong>Simon Birmingham</strong>, announced reforms that tighten up a scheme that has allowed 1,000 dodgy colleges to bloom. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/oct/05/coalition-overhauls-vocational-training-loans-in-private-college-crackdown\">We reported on this earlier</a>.</p> <p>The new system will impose tougher barriers to entry on private training colleges, loan caps will be applied to courses, course eligibility criteria will be strengthened in alignment with what the government terms \u201cindustry requirements\u201d, and there will be mandatory student engagement measures.</p> <p>Let\u2019s get on with it.

They ignore the reality that the bicycle path utopias of western admiration derive from years of extraction, exploitation and environmental abuse both in their geographies and further afield in the former colonial spaces that provided the capital for their reconstruction.<br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2016/feb/25/blackout-blues-the-lagos-nigeria-suburbs-that-have-been-in-darkness-for-five-years\">Lagos's blackout nightmare: the suburb that's been in darkness for five years</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Yes, for those frustrated with the mere mention of colonialism, it matters that the shifting of resources has created unequal pressures and outcomes for our urban environments. It matters that many overstressed cities, such as our beloved Lagos, were originally constructed to support a very small number of non-local people living very, very well.</p> <p>A catch-all document like the New Urban Agenda feels good in its unifying, cosmopolitan aspirations, but it elides the needs of urban areas in contexts so dissimilar as to almost render its proscriptions purposeless. Among other things, Lagos and many growing African cities face housing, infrastructure and power deficits that people in London, New York and Tokyo cannot imagine.</p> <p>For example, I remember when New York City experienced total chaos from a three-day blackout due to an electrical grid malfunction in 2003; my uncle and I watched from Lagos wondering what special kind of madness would ensue if we actually had electricity for three days straight.<strong> </strong>The contexts are not the same. </p> <p>We must acknowledge there is a fundamental unfairness in suggesting that Addis Ababa, Lagos and Nairobi should not be able to develop the way Amsterdam, London and New York grew, lest we all fall off the climate change cliff. <br></p> <p>When I dream about a sustainable future Lagos, I want to see the large landholdings currently occupied by unnecessary military bases turned into massive public parks. I want our lagoon to become a major part of a public transport system that reduces traffic on the road, pressure on the environment, and stress for the millions of people who live here.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f9005a7a59ed56637f4495e9e784f69edcba4aa2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f9005a7a59ed56637f4495e9e784f69edcba4aa2/0_0_5042_3361/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Street stall in Lagos\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Iweala believes that the New Urban Agenda can be achieved if the informal systems that underpin the growth of emerging African cities are formalised.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I want communities powered by alternative energy, solar panels and tidal turbines so that the city vibrates with the energy of people advancing, not the rumble of large standby generators in the compounds of the wealthy. I want a city in which waste water is treated and used for urban agriculture; where the security walls that currently separate crumble into dust; and where newcomers feel they have moved to new possibility, not just struggle. These are all things that the New Urban Agenda commits to \u2013 just without really saying how. </p> <p>Practically speaking, I know this comes only with greater executive and legislative accountability right here in our \u201cCentre of Excellence\u201d \u2013 an unlikely probability during Nigeria\u2019s current season of anomie. Then again, the sheer amount of political will necessary for radical urban transformation doesn\u2019t really exist anywhere in the world. It\u2019s why the fundamental inequalities and problems in cities transform so slowly<strong>, </strong>and why global conventions are generally ill-suited for the local change-making needed to improve lives.</p> <p>Instead, a utopian future Lagos must start with a few small steps that are largely applicable to cities like ours around the world.</p> <p>First and foremost, it\u2019s about fostering the political will to develop means for granting and honouring property rights in places where informality is both a coping mechanism and an Achilles heel for the poor. It\u2019s hard to invest in the upkeep of a place if your claim to the land you live on is tenuous at best. Without the security of property ownership, other areas of life become that much more difficult, and the city suffers.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2016/feb/26/things-changing-better-lagos-residents-share-stories\">'Beyond the chaos, there's a real human bond': Lagos residents share their stories</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Second, it\u2019s about innovating in safe, affordable housing made from low-cost but durable building materials. I\u2019m in love with the idea of recycling the massive amounts of plastic waste we produce in Lagos to create lasting building materials and new techniques. It sounds fantastical, but people are already doing it on a small scale.</p> <p>Finally, it\u2019s about pushing existing financial institutions to develop innovative ways of helping urban dwellers towards property ownership. The mortgages of Lagos need not look like the mortgages of London, but we won\u2019t know what it means unless there is some support for the level of risk involved.</p> <p>In many ways I\u2019ve bought into the logic of <a href=\"http://www.cato.org/friedman-prize/hernando-desoto/biography\">Hernando de Soto Polar</a>; I believe that an almost singular focus on formalising the informal systems that currently underpin the rapid growth of emerging African cities will make it easier to realise<strong> </strong>the intentions of the New Urban Agenda.

Biopesticides are not chemicals, therefore they do not create any residues.</p> <p>Sunday Ekesi, head of plant health at Kenya\u2019s International Centre of Insect Physiology and Ecology (ICIPE), says: \u201cIf you spray too much you have a residue problem, if you don\u2019t spray, you risk rejection due to fruit fly contamination, so it\u2019s a double whammy for the grower. That\u2019s where biopesticides have a real niche. The impact on income and reduction in rejection levels is tremendous. Growers can see the impact immediately within a season. There can be a 30-40% reduction in rejections.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2016/sep/24/crazy-milk-of-desert-senegal-dairy-farmers-africa\">'Crazy milk of the desert' transforming the lives of Senegal's dairy farmers</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Ekesi says biopesticides, such as the Met 69 system, are on the rise in Kenya, with companies such as Dudutech, Kenya Biologics and Farmtrack Consulting offering other environmentally-friendly solutions to various pests and diseases. \u201cI would describe Real IPM as pioneers in biopesticides for horticulture, but their package needs to be used alongside other management techniques, such as orchard hygiene and simple methods such as insect monitoring,\u201d he continues. \u201cAt the moment Real IPM is the only company I\u2019m aware of using the Met 69 product, but other companies have started to approach ICIPE to try something similar.\u201d<br></p> <p>There are drawbacks with the approach. Accessing and training remote, small-scale farmers is difficult, and the trap, soil and canopy treatment, alongside basic orchard management, must all be in place for real improvement to happen.<br></p> <p>Successful growers like Ngari are vital in helping to encourage others. \u201cYou can\u2019t teach everyone, you have to get to a few who are respected, and who can talk to others,\u201d says Wanyama. \u201cThis is a very scientific process, and laborious to educate. But growers are impressed with the improvement on yield.\u201d</p> <p>The cost of the system itself is comparable to other methods, according to Wanyama, who says Met 69 may cost more initially but it only has to be bought once, compared to multiple applications of pesticides. </p> <p>Once quality and yields are on track, Kenya\u2019s growers will begin to look outwards. \u201cI\u2019m preparing my farm and now I\u2019m looking for people to buy my mangoes,\u201d says Ngari. \u201cWe\u2019ve been selling to the Middle East for a long time, but the prices have gone down because of supply \u2013 we have a huge supply. Europe would be better as the prices are higher.\u201d</p> <p>Jonathan Bamber, whose dried mango manufacturer Kenyan-based Burton and Bamber buys from around 100 small farmers, says the improvement on his growers\u2019 yields from the Real IPM system is \u201cabsolutely noticeable\u201d. \u201cKenya could well be in the top five producers in the world on fresh and dried mango. It could be a huge revenue stream for small-scale farmers, but only if we can develop the market and demand, as well as the quality on the supply side.\u201d</p>",

I took my experiences and made them something new,\u201d he says on the phone from LA.</p> <p>But, unlike Weisberger\u2019s David v Goliath battle with an Anna Wintour-ish Miranda Priestly figure, An Innocent Fashion is a tussle of identity politics set against a background of fashion. With the rise of transgender models like Hari Nef and the issues of diversity on the catwalk swirling about, the publication of the book is timely. \u201cI think that, at the moment, there\u2019s an attempt to be more accepting of diversity,\u201d says Hern\u00e1ndez. \u201cBut, in reality, I feel like that\u2019s happening because it\u2019s a trend.

In the book, Ethan\u2019s biggest advantage is that he can pass for white.\u2019\u201d For Hern\u00e1ndez this name change bled into his entire external life, giving him permission to exaggerate his wardrobe and his personality. He says that it allowed him to ingratiate himself into Vogue\u2019s inner sanctum but that there was a price. \u201cThe identity that I was embracing was taking over and it could be read as a \u2018rich white person\u2019\u201d. His increasingly eccentric clothing choices \u2013 specifically a pair of shoes with four-inch-high heels \u2013 signalled the end of his time at Vogue.

  "<p>The UK government needs to kickstart technologies to suck carbon dioxide from the air if it is to play its part in meeting the goals of the Paris climate change agreement, according to the <a href=\"https://www.theccc.org.uk/\">Committee on Climate Change</a> (CCC), the government\u2019s official advisers.</p> <p>The global climate deal, which the prime minister, Theresa May, says the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/20/theresa-may-uk-ratify-paris-climate-change-agreement-this-year\">UK will ratify by the end of 2016</a>, pledges net zero emissions by the second half of the century, in order to avoid the worst impacts of global warming. Given that some emissions, such as those from aviation and agriculture, will be very difficult to reduce to zero, that means removing some carbon from the atmosphere.</p> <p>Planting trees is the simplest solution but is limited by the land available, meaning <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_dioxide_removal\">more radical technologies</a> need to be developed, such as chemically scrubbing CO2 from <a href=\"http://carbonengineering.com/\">the air and burying it</a>. \u201cA strategy for deployment [of new carbon-removal technologies] at scale by 2050 should start now given the timescales inherent in bringing new technologies to market,\u201d says a new CCC report.</p> <p>\u201cThe UK, in cooperation with other countries around the world, needs to come up with a bigger and more concerted effort around those greenhouse gas removal technologies if the ambition of Paris is to be met,\u201d said Matthew Bell, the CCC\u2019s chief executive. But the CCC report says aviation and agriculture must also be tackled by \u201csubstantial biofuel use in aircraft and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/dec/03/eating-less-meat-curb-climate-change\">reduced red meat consumption</a>\u201d.</p> <p>Another CCC report published on Thursday says the UK must act urgently to cut emissions from the heating of homes and other buildings, which are largely reliant on gas and cause 20% of the nation\u2019s carbon emissions. UK emissions have fallen 38% since 1990, but virtually all of this drop is from greener electricity. </p> <p>Lord Deben, the CCC\u2019s chairman, said a \u201cstep change\u201d was needed in how the UK heats its homes, a problem that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/nov/10/rudd-issues-transport-challenge-to-meet-uk-renewables-target\">threatens the UK\u2019s ability to meet its carbon targets</a>. The CCC said the government must focus on the rollout of heat pumps and low-carbon district heating systems and the testing of hydrogen as a clean-burning replacement for natural gas.</p> <p>Hydrogen has the advantage of using the existing gas network, but is as yet untested. The hydrogen could be produced using spare renewable electricity, from biofuels or from fossil fuels. The latter would only be low carbon if emissions were captured and stored but ministers abruptly <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/nov/25/uk-cancels-pioneering-1bn-carbon-capture-and-storage-competition\">cancelled its flagship carbon capture and storage policy</a> in November 2015. The CCC said hydrogen should receive similar research support to the \u00a3250m the government is already giving to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/nov/24/mini-nuclear-reactors-answer-to-climate-change-crisis\">small modular nuclear reactors.</a></p> <p>The CCC also criticised the government\u2019s slowdown in home energy efficiency measures: just half the number of homes made warmer and cheaper to heat in the last parliament are due to be upgraded in this parliament, and ministers <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/jul/10/uk-scraps-zero-carbon-home-target\">abandoned a plan to make all new homes zero-carbon</a>.</p> <p>\u201cWe still have millions of homes that have not been made efficient as they could be and we are still building homes that we will have to retrofit in a very short period of time,\u201d said Lord Deben. The CCC estimates 7m homes still have inadequate loft and wall insulation, the most basic form of energy efficiency, after the coalition government\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/apr/14/green-deal-scheme-did-not-deliver-energy-savings-audit-finds\">green deal policy failed</a>.</p> <p>Deben said the new ministers in May\u2019s government, including energy and business secretary, Greg Clark, and climate minister Nick Hurd, have long track records in backing strong climate action. \u201cI am optimistic but I still want to keep those feet to the fire,\u201d he said. \u201cThe fact is, crunch time is here. By law, the government have to provide a programme to reach [the CCC\u2019s] carbon budgets.\u201d The government\u2019s carbon reduction plan has been delayed by the Brexit referendum but is expected by February 2017.</p> <p>A third CCC report addresses the climate policy implications of Brexit for the UK. It notes that the UK\u2019s key climate targets - cutting emissions by 57% by 2030 and by at least 80% by 2050 - are already enshrined in domestic law, under the Climate Change Act. But the CCC said EU efficiency standards for vehicles and appliances would have to be replaced to avoid the risk of manufacturers dumping inefficient products on UK consumers.</p> <p>\u201cEfficiency standards cut costs for consumers, reduce emissions, and create a level playing field for competition.\u201d the CCC report says. \u201cIf the UK has weaker standards than the EU that could lead to a dumping on the UK market of inefficient products with higher running costs and emissions.\u201d</p> <p>The decisions required after Brexit, such as whether agricultural subsidies are more targeted at cutting carbon emissions, could cut both ways, said Deben, who opposed leaving the EU. \u201cWhere there are opportunities, there are also the opposite: people could make things much worse,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Prof Dieter Helm, at the University of Oxford <a href=\"http://www.dieterhelm.co.uk/energy/energy/energy-and-climate-policy-after-brexit/\">said</a>: \u201cThe uncertainties [for energy and climate policy] created by Brexit unsurprisingly leave the future as clear as mud, and the mud is likely to persist for months or even years.\u201d</p>",

Here was a newspaper that dared to challenge the government \u2013 whether on policy, corruption, or its onslaught against democracy.</p> <p>Authoritarian rightwing populism is sweeping the western world: Hungary is an acute example. We all know history turned a corner after the 2008 financial crisis: we are beginning to see how sharp that turn was. From the Scottish independence movement to Podemos in Spain, from Donald Trump to France\u2019s National Front and Hungary\u2019s far right, from the rise of Bernie Sanders and Jeremy Corbyn to Greece\u2019s Syriza: a painful struggle for the west\u2019s future has only just begun. Hungary\u2019s prime minister, Viktor Orb\u00e1n \u2013 whose rightwing party swept to victory in 2010 \u2013 recognises this. His chief lesson from 2008 is that \u201cliberal democratic states can\u2019t remain globally competitive\u201d. He has committed his government to building an \u201cilliberal democracy\u201d \u2013 and he is <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-07-28/orban-says-he-seeks-to-end-liberal-democracy-in-hungary\" title=\"\">remaining true to his word</a>.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Rather than being repelled, a new generation is being attracted to rightwing extremism</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Others have harsher descriptions.

His mother was a photographer, his father a senior ministry official, and they fled after the Soviet Union crushed Hungary\u2019s revolution in 1956. \u201cHungarian democracy is imperilled,\u201d he told me. \u201cWe\u2019re moving towards a Putinesque situation.\u201d As Human Right Watch\u2019s Lydia Gall puts it: \u201cWhat we\u2019ve seen in the last six years is essentially a continued undermining or deterioration of the rule of law and human rights protection.\u201d</p> <p>In 2010 and 2011, Hungary adopted a series of laws which were <a href=\"http://www.amnesty.eu/content/assets/Doc2011/Freedom_of_Expression_Under_Fire_-_Hungarian_Media_Law.pdf\" title=\"\">damned by Amnesty International</a> as \u201ca threat to the right to freedom of expression\u201d. Hungary\u2019s media outlets had to register with a national authority. The Klubr\u00e1di\u00f3 station \u2013 a persistent critic of the government \u2013 became one of its victims. At the end of 2011, the authority decided not to grant Klubr\u00e1di\u00f3 a licence to broadcast, forcing it into a <a href=\"https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2012/01/eu-must-press-hungary-respect-human-rights-norms/\" title=\"\">protracted battle</a> \u2013 though the station did eventually win.</p> <p>This authoritarian government has repeatedly amended the constitution: one change embedded discrimination against LGBT people by <a href=\"https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2012/01/eu-must-press-hungary-respect-human-rights-norms/\" title=\"\">defining the family as a unit</a> \u201cbased on the marriage of a man and a woman, or a linear blood relationship, or guardianship.

Hungary is, after all, dependent on economic assistance from the union. Article 7 of the EU constitution exists to sanction member states in violation of its norms, including the suspension of voting rights. The European commission has made it progressively harder to invoke, and last year the European parliament <a href=\"http://www.politico.eu/article/hungary-eu-news-article-7-vote-poland-rule-of-law/\" title=\"\">threw out a proposal</a> to invoke Article 7 \u2013 or even to activate a warning mechanism.</p> <p>When Hungary\u2019s government imposed the mass early retirement of veteran judges in favour of more pliant replacements, the EU did take action \u2013 but only on the <a href=\"http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-13-1112_en.htm\" title=\"\">grounds of age discrimination</a>. Hungary was fined and forced to pay financial compensation to those sacked \u2013 but it still achieved its goal.

Poland too is in the grip of an authoritarian right which chips away at the country\u2019s hard-won democracy. With no meaningful consequences, such governments feel increasingly emboldened. In Austria, the far right moves ever closer to power; in France, it grows stronger; in Sweden and other countries too.</p> <p>The cure to such movements is a left that offers an inspiring alternative relevant to the insecurities and ambitions of the post-2008 world. We don\u2019t have that yet. But that\u2019s no excuse for inaction. And we in Britain cannot smugly condemn Hungary, of course: since the Brexit vote, xenophobic nationalism has marched defiantly. Our prime minister condemns her political opponents as having disdain for patriotism; this week, both the Daily&#xa0;Mail and the Daily Express printed&#xa0;chilling front pages calling for \u201cunpatriotic Bremoaners\u201d to be damned for a \u201cplot to subvert the will of the British people\u201d, and demanding \u201cEU exit whingers\u201d be silenced.</p> <p>It is increasingly common in modern Europe for political opponents to be portrayed as unpatriotic fifth columnists.

While the law does not stipulate which name they should adopt, in practice women take their husband\u2019s name in 96% of cases.</p> <p>The chief judge, Atsushi Onose, told the court: \u201cIn identifying and distinguishing each individual, the surname registered in the family registration system serves better than the maiden name.\u201d</p> <p>The woman, who has worked at the junior and senior high schools affiliated with the university since 2003, told reporters that the insistence on using her married name diminished professional accomplishments she had made before marrying, such as writing reference books.</p> <p>The woman, who is in her 30s, said the ruling \u201cdestroys workplace environments that allow people who had to change their surnames [through <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/marriage \">marriage</a>] to continue working without having to worry unnecessarily\u201d.</p> <p>She had asked the school for permission to continue using her original name after she married in 2013 but the school insisted that she use her registered married surname while teaching.</p> <p>Her lawyers pointed out that their client was widely known by her previous name among teachers, pupils and parents, and accused the school\u2019s management of \u201cpower harassment\u201d by addressing her only by her married name.</p> <p>In practice many Japanese women continue to use their birth names at work, reserving their legal, married surname for official documents \u2013 a choice recognised by the supreme court in 2015.</p> <p>Masayuki Tanamura, a professor of family law at Waseda University in Tokyo, accused the court of being out of touch. \u201cThe ruling is a significant setback from the supreme court decision,\u201d he told the Asahi Shimbun. \u201cIndividual decisions should be respected at schools all the more, since that is where individuality is valued.\u201d<br></p> <p>Japan\u2019s status as one of only a few industrialised countries where married couples are legally required to use the same surnames prompted a UN committee on the elimination of discrimination against women to call on the government to revise the law.</p> <p>The justice ministry recommended 10 years ago that the same-name rule be abolished but the move was blocked by conservative politicians who described it as an attack on family values and social cohesion.</p> <p>When the law was introduced during the Meiji era (1868-1912) marriages were widely regarded as unions between families, not individuals. At the time it was common for a woman to leave her family to become part of her husband\u2019s family.</p> <p>The recent court ruling contrasts with attempts to make workplaces more female-friendly as part of a drive by the prime minister, Shinzo Abe, to boost growth by bringing more women into the workforce. </p>",
  "<p>Voters in the Australian Capital Territory will return to the polls this Saturday to elect a new legislative assembly for the next four years. The ACT has had its own self-governing assembly since 1989 and, in that time, it has developed quite differently from most other parliaments in Australia, with the voting system favouring minority governments and multi-party politics.</p> <p>Since 1995, the ACT has used the Hare-Clark system to elect the assembly. This system is also used to elect the lower house of the Tasmanian parliament and is similar to the system used to elect the Senate. Five members are elected to represent each electorate and each candidate needs a quota of roughly one sixth of the vote to win a seat. This proportional voting system makes it very difficult for one party to win a majority on their own, with members of different parties representing the same electorate.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/southern-crossroads/2016/oct/11/clean-energy-transition-happening-act-at-risk\">A clean energy transition is already happening, but it is at risk | Alexander White</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The main difference between the Senate voting system and Hare-Clark is in how each party\u2019s candidates are ranked. In Senate elections, each party nominates a ticket in a particular order. The candidates are listed in that order on the ballot and we have the shortcut of voting above the line to preference the candidates in the predetermined order. There is no such order in ACT elections. The \u201cRobson rotation\u201d system means that different ballot papers have different candidates at the top of their party\u2019s list and you can\u2019t just vote above the line for a party: you have to vote for individual candidates. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"ACT elections\">  <iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"520\" frameborder=\"0\" src=\"https://benraue.carto.com/viz/b987dcc0-fad2-48e6-8b10-7a3fbee25d70/embed_map\" allowfullscreen webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen oallowfullscreen msallowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>  <p>Robson rotation weakens the power of the party and encourages individual candidates to run their own campaigns. Even if a party holds one or two \u201csafe\u201d seats in an electorate, those seats are not safe for any individual member \u2013 it\u2019s not uncommon for a member of the assembly to lose their seat to a fellow member of their own party and seats are only safe when the sitting MP is a high-profile and popular MP (such as the leader of a party).</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/jun/08/australian-territory-to-pay-for-domestic-violence-prevention-with-yearly-levy\">Australian territory to pay for domestic violence prevention with yearly levy</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Since 1995, the assembly has consisted of 17 members elected to represent three electorates. The larger central electorate, Molonglo, elected seven members while the other two electorates elected five members each. The assembly will expand to 25 members at this election. There are now five electorates, with each electorate electing five members.</p> <p>These five electorates roughly cover the five main centres of Canberra: Belconnen (Ginninderra), Gungahlin (Yerrabi), Weston Creek/Woden Valley (Murrumbidgee), Tuggeranong (Brindabella) and central Canberra (Kurrajong).</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/jun/08/australian-territory-to-pay-for-domestic-violence-prevention-with-yearly-levy\">Australian territory to pay for domestic violence prevention with yearly levy</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Since Hare-Clark is proportional, parties rarely win a majority of seats. Only one election produced a majority for a single party \u2013 for Labor in 2004. In every other assembly, the government had to form an alliance with independents or minor parties to pass legislation and stay in power.</p> <p>Labor has ruled the ACT for a majority of the last 27 years. Both parties formed government at different times in the first ACT legislative assembly, with Labor leading the second assembly elected in 1992. A Liberal minority government served for two terms, from 1995 until 2001.</p> <p>Jon Stanhope led Labor back into power in 2001. He won a second term in 2004, winning the only majority government in ACT political history.</p> <p>Stanhope\u2019s Labor government lost its majority in 2008. The ACT Greens, who had held at least one seat in every assembly since 1995, managed to win four seats and formed an alliance with the Labor government.</p> <p>At the 2012 election, Labor and Liberal both gained seats off the Greens. The major parties each won eight seats, with the Greens\u2019 Shane Rattenbury holding a single seat for his party. The Labor-Greens alliance was renewed, with Rattenbury becoming the first Greens minister in the ACT.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2015/may/11/job-cuts-in-act-public-service-would-be-a-broken-promise-says-chief-minister\">Public service job cuts would break promise to the ACT, says chief minister</a> </p> </aside>  <p>A party will need to win a majority of seats in three out of five electorates to win a majority in the assembly. That will be tough for either Labor or Liberal to achieve. The Greens should retain their single seat and will be hopeful of gaining a handful of other seats. Numerous other minor parties and independents are running but it will be hard for any of them to win a seat.</p> <p>It isn\u2019t possible to predict who will win the election, as there hasn\u2019t been any reliable polling published. It seems most likely that a Labor minority government, probably in alliance with the Greens, will continue after this election but the Liberal party holds hope that, after 15 years of Labor rule, territorians will be looking for change.</p>",
  "<p>Two teenage boys have been charged over allegedly preparing a terrorist act and being members of a terrorist organisation, as police warn the threat of a terrorist attack on Australian soil remains \u201cprobable\u201d.</p> <p>The 16-year-olds were arrested allegedly carrying two bayonet-type knives by the joint counter-terrorism team near a Bankstown prayer hall in western Sydney on Wednesday.</p> <p>Each was charged on Thursday with planning a terrorist act, which carries a penalty of life in prison, and being a member of a terrorist organisation, which carries a penalty of 10 years\u2019 imprisonment, NSW police said.</p> <p>Police had believed an attack was imminent, New South Wales police Acting Commissioner Catherine Burn told reporters in Sydney.</p> <p>\u201cWe will be alleging that the two 16-year-old boys went to a gun shop in Bankstown and purchased two knives,\u201d she said. \u201cThey have then gone from that location, caught a bus to the location in Bankstown where they were arrested and those items were seized.</p> <p>\u201cWe believe the attack was inspired by Islamic State,\u201d Burn added. She declined to confirm reports one was related to a man already in jail convicted of terror offences. \u201cWe were well aware of these two 16-year-olds. We have been concerned about them,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Police laid charges at 5am after holding the boys overnight. The pair is due to appear in Parramatta children\u2019s court later on Thursday.</p> <p>Burn said the risk of terrorist attack in Australia remained \u201cprobable\u201d, and said all members of the Australian community needed to remain vigilant. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to remember that our current threat level is probable.
