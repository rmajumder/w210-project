  "<p>A man has escaped a run-in with a shark on the New South Wales north coast with just a few teeth marks on his thigh.</p> <p>He was taken to Byron Bay hospital by a friend about 7.30am after suffering the bite while surfing on a beach between Suffolk Park and Broken Head on Monday morning. </p> <p>The shark swam under the man, believed to be in his late 30s, while he was waiting for a wave and the surfboard took the brunt of the attack, Surf Life Saving said.</p> <p>The beach was not patrolled at the time and has been closed. Surf lifesavers have also closed other beaches in the Byron Bay region for 24 hours.</p> <p>Geoffrey Knapp, who offered first aid at the scene, said the surfer had three punctures in his thigh. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/lizeburke/status/790304381157543936\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Pic of surfer bitten by shark at Broken Head this morning via <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SealSpirit\">@sealspirit</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/O6NyxmalpL\">https://t.co/O6NyxmalpL</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/newscomauHQ\">@newscomauHQ</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/vsGp6hpY7Y\">pic.twitter.com/vsGp6hpY7Y</a></p>&mdash; Liz Burke (@lizeburke) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/lizeburke/status/790304381157543936\">October 23, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>\u201cThey\u2019re deep tooth wounds,\u201d he told ABC. \u201cBut in the great scheme of things it\u2019s marginal but his surfboard took the brunt of the bite.\u201d</p> <p>Knapp said he and a friend had been surfing near a group of dolphins when he saw the surfer leaving the water in a hurry.

  "<p>Theresa May has been warned to expect a \u201cfull-blown constitutional crisis\u201d unless agreement on the terms of Brexit can be reached between the government and the UK\u2019s devolved administrations. </p> <p>The stark prediction comes as the prime minister hosts talks on Monday with the leaders of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland for the first time since the UK voted to leave the EU on 23 June.</p> <p>In a report published on Monday, the <a href=\"http://www.instituteforgovernment.org.uk/\">Institute for Government</a> said unless all four leaders agree on the \u201ccore planks\u201d of the UK\u2019s negotiating position before <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/01/theresa-may-to-propose-great-repeal-bill-to-unwind-eu-laws\">May triggers article 50</a>, formally starting the Brexit<strong> </strong>process, the result could be \u201ca serious breakdown in relations between the four governments and nations of the UK\u201d.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/24/brexit-strategy-scotland-wales-northern-ireland-direct-line-david-davis-theresa-may\">May is preparing to offer</a> Scotland\u2019s first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, the Welsh first minister, Carwyn Jones, and Northern Ireland\u2019s first minister, Arlene Foster, and her deputy, Martin McGuinness, a \u201cdirect line\u201d to the Brexit secretary, David Davis, to allow them to help shape Britain\u2019s EU exit strategy.</p> <p>But the offer is made against a background of continuing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/23/scotland-equal-partner-brexit-talks-holyrood\">clashes between May and Sturgeon</a> over who has a more substantial mandate regarding Scotland\u2019s relationship with the UK and Europe, and as the devolved administration leaders present an increasingly united front against Westminster.</p> <p>Ahead of the joint ministerial committee (JMC) meeting on Monday, in a letter to May, Sturgeon formally endorsed a proposal from Jones that any planned negotiating package should be subject to a vote in all four UK parliaments and assemblies.</p> <p>Anticipating that the three devolved governments would seek such a vote, the Institute for Government noted that although the UK parliament remains sovereign and could legally ignore the views of Holyrood, Cardiff Bay and Stormont, this would be a \u201creckless strategy for a government committed to the union\u201d. </p> <p>The organisation warned that forcing the devolved administrations to comply \u201cwould seriously undermine relationships between the four governments, and increase the chances of Scottish independence and rifts in Northern Ireland\u2019s fragile power-sharing arrangements\u201d.</p> <p>May will make the offer of a new official forum, which would be chaired by Davis and meet at least twice before the end of the year, and insist that \u201cit is imperative that the devolved administrations play their part in making [Brexit negotiations] work.\u201d</p> <p>By placing future discussions on a formal footing, May will say she is giving the Scottish, Welsh and Northern Irish leaders \u201cthe chance for them all to put forward their proposals on how to seize the opportunities presented by Brexit and deliver the democratic decision expressed by the people of the UK\u201d.</p> <p>Sturgeon has already said she will push for substantial additional powers for Holyrood as part of article 50 negotiations, including over international trade deals and immigration.</p> <p>But this appeared to be rebuffed by Davis during a visit to Scotland on Friday, when he insisted that any arrangements to leave the EU would be a \u201cUnited Kingdom deal\u201d.</p> <p>A Downing Street source said while the JMC had existed since devolution, the discussions over Brexit had provided a new impetus for its work.<br></p> <p>\u201cIt will be the formal forum in which the devolved administrations feed in their ideas and make their case on what is important around Brexit,\u201d the source said.</p> <p>While the relevant secretaries of state for Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland would continue to speak for their administrations in parliament, JMC meetings are \u201ca chance for the devolved administration leaders as well,\u201d the source said. \u201cThey do have a voice that needs to be heard and a role to play. And as the prime minister has repeatedly made clear, we\u2019re leaving the EU as the UK.\u201d</p> <p>May is also expected to discuss the government\u2019s position on the Brexit strategy at the JMC and say that contrary to some speculation, no final decisions have been taken and how the UK leaves the EU will not boil down to a binary choice.</p> <p>Although May called for a \u201cnew grown-up relationship\u201d between Westminster and the devolved administrations ahead of the meeting, the war of words between the Scottish and UK governments has continued since Thursday, when Sturgeon <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/20/second-scottish-independence-referendum-bill-published\">published a draft bill</a> on a second independence referendum.</p> <p>The Scottish National party leader said she had a clear mandate to hold a second vote, because the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/may/06/scottish-labour-facing-third-place-after-collapse-in-vote\">SNP had been elected</a> in May on a manifesto commitment to do so, should there be a \u201csignificant and material change in the circumstances that prevailed in 2014, such as Scotland being taken out of the EU against our will\u201d.</p> <p>Sturgeon has promised to work with progressive parties and Conservative moderates across the UK to seek to avert a hard Brexit and bring forward proposals to protect Scotland\u2019s place in the single market, even if the rest of the UK leaves.</p> <p>However, a Number 10 spokesperson immediately dismissed the plan for a second vote. \u201cThe prime minister and the government does not believe that there is a mandate for one,\u201d they said. \u201cThere was one only two years ago. There was an extremely high turnout and there was a resounding result in favour of Scotland remaining in the UK.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2016/jun/24/eu-referendum-how-britain-voted-for-brexit-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/4mjmt\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2573253\"            data-video-name=\"EU referendum: how Britain voted for Brexit \u2013\u00a0video\"            data-video-provider=\"Various\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-576cb4f7e4b0f430381097cc\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/06/24/160623nightunfolded2_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2016/06/24/160623nightunfolded2_small.3gp\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2016/06/24/160623nightunfolded2_large.3gp\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/06/24/160623nightunfolded2.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/06/24/160623nightunfolded2_synd_768k_vp8.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2016/jun/24/eu-referendum-how-britain-voted-for-brexit-video\">EU referendum: how Britain voted for Brexit \u2013 video</a></figcaption> </figure>",

Rosberg will start second with the Red Bull duo of Daniel Ricciardo and Max Verstappen on the second row. </p> <p><strong>Then again, a quick look back </strong>through some of this season\u2019s turning points is a reminder that pole position does not always translate to top of the podium, especially when Hamilton is on the front. The technical problems that have dogged his starts are always lurking in the background and should they surface at the Circuit of the Americas, his hopes of a fourth US Grand Prix win will be in serious peril. More importantly, the championship will be Rosberg\u2019s to lose. </p> <p><strong>Beyond the Mercedes drivers</strong> there is a whole field of action and plenty to look out for, most notably Red Bull\u2019s timely late-season surge and Ferrari\u2019s issues which leave Sebastian Vettel sounding a little more fed up with each passing session.

  "<p>If you discover your favourite aromatic plants and herbs are looking chewed this autumn the culprit is almost certainly the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2006/apr/18/gardens\">rosemary beetle</a> <em>(</em><em>Chrysolina Americana), </em>an unwelcome new addition to the UK\u2019s gardens \u2013 thanks to climate change.</p> <p>Despite its name, <em>Americana, </em>its original home is the Mediterranean and North Africa, but the increasing warmth of the British climate means it can now survive and thrive here. It was first seen London in 1994 and after a slow start it has rapidly spread in England and now reached Scotland and Northern Ireland.</p> <p>While, as the name suggests, it is often found on rosemary, it also eats lavender, sage, thyme and other related aromatic herbs. These are plants which are normally pest free so this makes the beetle a doubly annoying invader.</p> <p>Both the rather startling metallic green and purple striped adult beetles and the more inconspicuous slug-like greyish white larvae feed on the same plants, chewing their leaves to stumps. The adults, about 6-8mm long, can be found at any time of year, but larvae that grow to the same size, are particularly active during warm autumn weather. A large infestation can reduce most of the plants in the herb garden to skeletons by spring.</p> <p>This has alarmed, among others, the Royal Horticultural Society (RHS), which has a <a href=\"https://www.rhs.org.uk/advice/profile?pid=555\">helpful guide to this invader</a> and how to control it. It also has a campaign to try and track where the beetle has now reached.</p> <p>The most <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-BUNHiA1N4\">recent map</a> shows that it is now all over the south-east of England but elsewhere seems to do best in cities, like Manchester, where it is warmer. Large areas of countryside with frosty winters are so far still free of this pest.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/jan/24/pests-moths-carpets\">The curious case of the case-bearing carpet moth</a> </p> </aside>  <p>One of the problems with control is that many people grow the species that the beetle eats (apart from lavender) to flavour their cooking. Most pesticides which kill the beetles and their lava, also render the herbs uneatable, although the RHS suggest some brands that the makers say are not harmful to humans. However, pesticides will also kill a lot of beneficial insects including bees.</p> <p>Picking the adult beetles off is laborious so the RHS recommends giving the plants a good shake. On the advice site is a helpful video demonstrating how to place a big piece of white paper under a rosemary bush to catch them all. Someone else suggested an upturned umbrella. How this works for low growing thyme is not shown. In any event once captured they have to be squashed.</p> <p>The larvae remain active all through the winter or until they are fully-grown. By April all will have dug their way into the soil to pupate, emerging in early summer. Because the beetles live a long time they can be found on the plants all the year round.</p> <p>The adults do not appear to eat much in summer but in August they start munching, mate and lay eggs.</p> <p>The good news is that, come the spring, when the larvae disappear into the ground, most chewed plants recover, throwing out new growth to replace their lost leaves. However, the beetles have no natural predators in this country and will soon re-emerge, so control will be needed. Since the beetles are slow, and just hang about on their food plants, the summer is the best chance to fight back. </p>",

A frantic game of cat and mouse is likely to unfold, as migrants who do not want to claim asylum in France try to avoid officers, who will attempt to prevent small camps from springing up in the region. <br></p> <p>Almost two-thirds of migrants surveyed in the camp said they did not want to be evicted and taken to French accommodation, while one-third said they would continue to try to get to the UK, according to the <a href=\"http://refugeerights.org.uk/\">Refugee Rights Data Project</a>.<br></p> <p>Just over one-quarter of 429 people living in the camp and surveyed between early September and early October said they would prefer to sleep in the street, while 15% said they would rather go to a different country.

  "<p>Australian hip-hop has an uncomfortable relationship with the concept of authenticity. With some notable exceptions, many of the most popular local rappers have been young white men, emulating the affect, if not always the accent, of black American artists. </p> <p>For a few years, \u201cAussie hip-hop\u201d signified a specific sound: broad accents, basic production and blokey attitudes. So when the Adelaide-based, Zimbabwe-born rapper Tkay Maidza released her first singles \u2013 the gleeful, merciless stomper Brontosaurus, and the pixellated dancehall-dubstep of Handle My Ego \u2013 she quickly discovered that her cocksure, party-ready material wasn\u2019t necessarily finding favour with the <a href=\"http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Skip-Hop\">skip-hop</a> faithful.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/dec/24/iggy-azalea-azealia-banks-hip-hop-appropriation-problem\">Azealia Banks, Iggy Azalea and hip-hop's appropriation problem</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cI remember when I first started, I used to see things on Aussie hip-hop forums,\u201d Maidza says. \u201c[People] being like, \u2018Hey guys, do we like this?\u2019 And then the guys would be like, \u2018Um nah, it\u2019s too pop for me,\u2019 or, \u2018It\u2019s too weird,\u2019 or, \u2018This isn\u2019t real.\u2019 And in the beginning I was just really sad, but then I started to realise that what I was doing was not for them and it didn\u2019t bother me. </p> <p>\u201cSo whenever people were like, \u2018I don\u2019t like this,\u2019 I would make a fake account and be like, \u2018It\u2019s not for you though\u2019 \u2026 I began to understand that I didn\u2019t really want to fit in, and I didn\u2019t mind.\u201d</p> <p>With machine-gun diction influenced by Nicki Minaj and Santigold, and a preference for bottom-heavy, unfussy production that runs the gamut from glitter bomb to air raid, Maidza has built a solid following the old-fashioned way. She has played exuberant sets at what seems like every single Australian festival in the past few years, releasing a consistent but clearly evolving series of singles and collaborations \u2013 including features from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/dec/04/troye-sivan-i-came-into-the-music-industry-as-an-out-person\">certified teen sensation Troye Sivan</a> and the mega-producer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/jul/20/martin-solveig-interview-dance-music-my-house\">Martin Solveig</a> \u2013 and making her name (pronounced tee-kay my-dza, with the \u201cai\u201d as in \u201cchai\u201d) synonymous with unadulterated fun. </p> <p>She also commands attention from veterans.

As he saw it, when they both played Falls festival over the previous new year, Australian fans were more excited about Maidza\u2019s effervescent energy than Azalea\u2019s warmed-over swagger: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I\u2019m in America, people are asking me to be angry about the whole cultural appropriation of a white woman who\u2019s Australian who just grew up liking hip-hop \u2026 But while I\u2019m angry and raging about that because I believe the whole world is American \u2013 in Australia \u2026 there\u2019s sold-out shows with a little black girl who can dance her ass off.

Team Tkay sent through the anthemic Carry On \u201cand literally within a week and a half he sent me two verses!\u201d (The one that didn\u2019t make it on to the track, Maidza says, was \u201cmore Run the Jewels-y\u201d, \u201cless me\u201d.)<br></p> <p>Her idea of a rallying cry, at the moment, is more inspired by Santigold, Major Lazer and Lorde than Run the Jewels: youthful defiance without agenda; rebellion without a cause. \u201cIt\u2019s not like political or anything, [those artists are] just like, \u2018We\u2019re kids, we\u2019re young, we want to run free,\u2019\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s not like a, \u2018Don\u2019t shoot us\u2019 \u2026 because I don\u2019t feel like I can talk about that.\u201d</p> <p>She continues: \u201c[Politics are] really dominant in everyone\u2019s lives but for me it\u2019s not what my heart wants to talk about. It\u2019s not what my soul wants to talk about.\u201d</p> <p>In other words, it\u2019s not that she doesn\u2019t care \u2013 just that, as she sings in Carry On, she\u2019s \u201cstill kinda young\u201d. \u201cI think eventually I\u2019ll go there but I have to find out a lot about myself first,\u201d she says.</p> <p>Carry On is a brush-off to haters with a hook that frames her age as a strength. That qualifying \u201ckinda\u201d feels like a wry nod to the three-year wait between debut single and debut album \u2013 the latter was due last year but took a while to take shape, as Maidza played shows supporting pop-dance act Years &amp; Years in London and worked through writing phases that she characterises as \u201csad [and] Lorde-y\u201d and \u201creally angry experimental stuff\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"eaf268c4fbd1af8f2694d2b74aa6ca94496febd9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/eaf268c4fbd1af8f2694d2b74aa6ca94496febd9/0_0_1000_1000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tkay Maidza\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018There\u2019s a bolshie energy that runs through her work \u2013 a pre-emptive warning not to make the mistake of getting in her way.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dew Process</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Writing sessions with the rising singer-songwriter George Maple, among others, produced some more fully realised pop.

But for Maidza, that\u2019s simply not where she\u2019s at. \u201cI have so much to learn.

  "<p>If one wanted to be charitable about it, maybe out of gratitude for all those verbal donations that Jos\u00e9 Mourinho says he makes to football Einsteins, one could suggest this was just one of those occasions when Manchester United fell foul of the Law of Murphy, as Louis van Gaal used to put it. You could even point to the referee, Martin Atkinson, for evidence to back up the Bad Day at the Office theory, as he booked Eric Bailly for being on the scene of a tumble by Diego Costa and then gave the same punishment to David Luiz for lunging into Marouane Fellaini\u2019s knee like a violent Cossack dancer.</p> <p>But that would be bunkum and only a fool would buy it. The truth is that this miserable performance exposed deep problems at Manchester United. Mourinho was accused by some purists of besmirching United\u2019s culture with his ultra-negative approach <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/oct/17/liverpool-manchester-united-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">at Anfield on Monday</a> but at least his team had an identity there. At Stamford Bridge, by contrast, United were a rabble without a cause. Or a team without the ability or willingness to implement whatever plan they had. They were slow and ragged and their body language was not the sort of thing that should have been televised before the watershed.</p> <p>That much was made clear within 30 seconds, when Chris Smalling and Daley Blind dithered and allowed Pedro to pilfer the ball and canter round David de Gea to open the scoring. The second goal was no better, Ander Herrera being surprised by a bouncing ball before Smalling turned away and Gary Cahill converted from close range under no pressure. There was slackness preceding Chelsea\u2019s third and fourth goals, too. And in general United misplaced many passes, made few tackles and were outfought and out-thought. If Mourinho thought that the back-to-basics success at Liverpool gave him something to build on, that notion went out the window in the first minute here and was never retrieved.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/oct/23/chelsea-manchester-united-premier-league-match-report\">N\u2019Golo Kant\u00e9\u2019s solo strike seals Chelsea\u2019s rout of Manchester United</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Incessant mistakes from players such as Smalling and Blind underlined concerns about the ability of United\u2019s defence to sustain solidity across two tough away games let alone a season. But more alarming was the fact that so many United players did not appear to know what they were supposed to be doing. Marcus Rashford surely did not envisage spending so long as an auxiliary left-back giving chase to Victor Moses; Zlatan Ibrahimovic is not going to end his scoreless streak by constantly dropping deep in the manner of <em>fin de carri\u00e8re</em> Wayne Rooney; and Paul Pogba was an expensive passenger that United cannot afford to keep carrying.</p> <p>The first thing to say here is that even if players are uncomfortable in their role they need to show the gumption to run around and put in tackles \u2013 to fight. Here so many players, most glaringly Pogba, meekly accepted Chelsea\u2019s superiority that it raised questions about their personalities before any consideration was given to formation and team selection. Maybe Mourinho was not blowing smoke, after all, when he said earlier this season that he needed to protect his squad because many of his players were very sensitive to criticism. A lot of them seemed soft here.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2016/oct/23/chelsea-manchester-united-premier-league-live\">Chelsea 4-0 Manchester United: Premier League \u2013 as it happened</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But maybe, also, Mourinho is not helping as much as he should. Maybe his decisions are not bringing much clarity or support. He inherited a squad with deficiencies and a lack of balance but so did Antonio Conte and the Italian, despite getting less backing in terms of transfers, seems closer to a solution and has more visible buy-in from his players.</p> <p>At Stamford Bridge, as at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/18/watford-manchester-united-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">Vicarage Road in September</a> and several other times this season, United have looked nothing like the team of specialists that Mourinho said during the summer that he wanted to build. And again there was no sign of one of the four players that Mourinho asked for and was given before the start of the campaign: Mourinho has said that Henrikh Mkhitaryan does not yet have enough match fitness to compete with Premier League intensity but that does not seem a valid reason for omitting such a high-class player when so many of United\u2019s starters lacked intensity, too.</p> <p>A similar point might be made about Michael Carrick, who was left out here despite an excellent performance <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/oct/20/manchester-united-fenerbahce-europa-league-group-a-match-report\" title=\"\">against Fenerbahce in the Europa League on Thursday,</a> after which Mourinho praised him for providing, yes, \u201cbalance\u201d and \u201cintensity\u201d.</p> <p>United, in sum, put in the sort of performance that is commonly seen at the start of a managerial reign \u2013 or the end of one. The thing is, of course, that United are not a common-or-garden club, this is a particularly impatient age and they and Mourinho attract special demands. So the manager needs to find a way quickly of getting the best out of an imperfect squad. The suggestion that Mourinho is out of sync with modern football is not necessarily correct \u2013 look at how Leicester won last season\u2019s Premier League, how Portugal won the European Championships or even how Chelsea won here \u2013 but at the moment Mourinho and some of his players do not seem to be enjoying their time together.

Although neural networks might be said to write their own programs, they do so towards goals set by humans, using data collected for human purposes. If the data is skewed, even by accident, the computers will amplify injustice. If the measures of success that the networks are trained against are themselves foolish or worse, the results will appear accordingly. Recent, horrifying examples include the use of algorithms to grade teachers in the US and to decide whether prisoners should be granted parole or not. In both these cases, the effect has been to punish the poor just for being poor.</p> <p>This kind of programming is, in <a href=\"http://idlewords.com/talks/sase_panel.htm\" title=\"\">the programmer Maciej Ceg\u0142owski</a>\u2019s phrase, like money-laundering for bias. But because the obnoxious determinations are made by computer programs, they seem to have an unassailable authority. We should not grant them this. Self-interest, as well as justice, is on the side of caution here. Algorithmic trading between giant banks is certainly to blame for such phenomena as \u201cflash crashes\u201d and is very plausibly responsible for the great financial disaster of 2008. But there is nothing inevitable about the decision to hand over to a computer the capacity to make decisions for us. There is always a human responsibility and this belongs with the companies or organisations that make use of \u2013 or at least unleash \u2013 the powers of the computer networks. To pretend otherwise is&#xa0;like blaming the outbreak of the first world war <a href=\"http://media.nationalarchives.gov.uk/index.php/railways-and-the-mobilisation-for-war-in-1914/\" title=\"\">on railway timetables</a> and their effect on&#xa0;the mobilisation of armies.</p> <p>The cure for the excesses of computerised algorithms is not in principle different from the remedies we have already discovered for algorithms that are embedded in purely human institutions. Expert claims must be scrutinised by outsiders and justified to sceptical, if intelligent and fair minded, observers. There needs to be a social mechanism for appealing against these judgments, and means to identify their mistakes and prevent them happening in future. The interests of the powerful must not be allowed to take precedence over the interests of justice and of society as a whole.</p>",
  "<p>The government\u2019s decision to greenlight aviation expansion (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/23/chris-grayling-decision-heathrow-gatwick-airport-expansion-tuesday\">Chris Grayling: decision on airport expansion to be made on Tuesday</a>, theguardian.com, 23 October) is a predictable failure, but not an acceptable one. With the scrapping of vital decarbonisation policies and funding, the UK is already way off-track to meet our climate change commitments. The impacts of any new runway will be devastating to people\u2019s lives and to the planet. Locally it will see the demolition of hundreds of homes, result in increased noise pollution, and illegal levels of air pollution \u2013 already responsible for almost 10,000 premature deaths in London every year.</p> <p>But the biggest tragedy of the government\u2019s failure is a global one. Only around 5% of the world\u2019s population flies at all, yet the impacts of climate change \u2013 droughts, floods and heatwaves \u2013 are already hitting poorer communities in the global south, who are the least likely to ever set foot on a plane.</p> <p>The push for more runway space is not about demand from business \u2013 that has been dropping for over a decade. Nor is it about people taking one or two annual holidays. Growth is being driven by the frequent leisure flyers taking weekend breaks and shopping trips by plane. Half of the UK population don\u2019t fly in any given year, yet all of us subsidise the holidays of the rich.</p> <p>The UK must not abandon our commitments under the Paris agreement and the Climate Change Act for the convenience of binge flyers. We will not allow our government to ignore the promises they have made to us and to the world.</p> <p><strong>Craig Bennett </strong><em>CEO, Friends of the Earth England, Wales and Northern Ireland, </em><strong>Nicky Bull </strong><em>Chair, Operation Noah, </em><strong>Amy Cameron </strong><em>Director, 10:10, </em><strong>Sarah Clayton </strong><em>Coordinator, AirportWatch, </em><strong>Peter Deane </strong><em>Biofuelwatch, </em><strong>Bill Hemmings </strong><em>Director, aviation and shipping, European Federation for Transport and Environment, </em><strong>Claire James </strong><em>Campaigns coordinator, Campaign Against Climate Change, </em><strong>Rosalie James </strong><em>Chair, Aircraft Noise 3 Villages</em><strong> </strong><em>(Lightwater, Windlesham &amp; Bagshot), </em><strong>Tim Johnson </strong><em>Director, Aviation Environment Federation, </em><strong>James MacColl </strong><em>Head of campaigns, Campaign for Better Transport, </em><strong>Kara Moses </strong><em>Environment editor, Red Pepper, </em><strong>Leo Murray </strong><em>Director, Fellow Travellers, </em><strong>Danielle Paffard </strong><em>UK divestment campaigner, 350.org, </em><strong>John Sauven </strong><em>Executive director, Greenpeace UK, </em><strong>Kia Trainor </strong><em>Director, CPRE Sussex, </em><strong>Anna Vickerstaff </strong><em>Co-director, UK Youth Climate Coalition, </em><strong>Vivienne Westwood </strong><em>Climate Revolution, </em><strong>Peter Willan </strong><em>Chair, Richmond Heathrow Campaign</em></p> <p>\u2022 Nigel Milton, director of external affairs at Heathrow, says the Airports Commission\u2019s analysis \u201cconcluded that a third runway at Heathrow can be delivered in accordance with EU air-quality limit law, and would have less impact on health receptors (where people live and work) than a runway at Gatwick would have on the community in that area\u201d (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/oct/21/heathrow-expansion-will-boost-air-quality\">Letters</a>, 22 October).</p> <p>It made no such conclusion at all. Quite the opposite, in fact; the 2015 Business and Sustainability Assessment said of the Heathrow North West Runway that \u201cagainst the Commission\u2019s objective to improve air quality consistent with EU standards and local planning policy requirements the unmitigated impact of the Heathrow Northwest Runway scheme is SIGNIFICANTLY ADVERSE. Mitigations as above could limit this impact to ADVERSE if delivered with concerted effort from all parties including HAL but given the increases in pollutant concentrations at various health receptors and despite the fact that EU and local policy limits are not necessarily breached, the impact is unlikely to be able to reach a NEUTRAL level.</p> <p>\u201cThe Heathrow Airport Northwest Runway scheme performs more poorly than Gatwick with respect to EU limit values as Gatwick has no monitoring stations predicted to be in breach of EU limit values, but more strongly than Heathrow Airport Extended Northern Runway\u201d.</p> <p>Since that was written, it has been verified that EU emissions limits around Heathrow are actually being breached now.</p> <p>Mr Milton and others may be of the view that Heathrow expansion will be the best thing ever for the economy with \u00a3211bn in economic benefits, although without any explanation I suspect that figure may be plucked out of the air. Benefits or not, one thing is for certain \u2013 Heathrow is poisoning the residents around it now and will do so more if expanded. The Cambridge study is not worth the paper that it is written on. It is theoretical and modelled, and it depends on compliance with the Euro 6 engine emissions limits. Tests have shown that while vehicles may comply in laboratory situations, they are failing by up to 1,500% when out on the road.<br><strong>Neil Spurrier</strong><br><em>Twickenham</em></p> <p>\u2022 Nigel Milton appears to be living in a parallel universe. Under current EU legislation, it is impossible to give the go-ahead for a third runway without an avalanche of legal challenges. Heathrow breaches the EU air quality directive for a number of pollutants, but nitrogen dioxide is the most intractable as local traffic and congestion is bound to increase in line with passenger numbers. The strategy being adopted by Heathrow management depends upon new diesel engines emitting less pollutants than current models, but this strategy is doomed to failure as recent studies demonstrate that even Euro 6 diesel engines emit much more NO<sub>2</sub> on the road than they do in lab testing.</p> <p>I suspect the reason that Theresa May has delayed a parliamentary vote on Heathrow (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/oct/18/airport-expansion-vote-put-on-hold-for-more-than-a-year-by-theresa-may\">Report</a>, 19 October) is to give the UK parliament time to invoke article 50, and repeal the relevant EU air quality directive.

But those factors \u2013 Catholicism, misogyny, an obsession with controlling women\u2019s bodies \u2013 sound more archaic with each passing year. Within Ireland, consistent polling shows there is now a desire for women not to be criminalised for abortions and for the constitutional ban on abortion to be repealed. The tangible obstacle is the eighth amendment to the constitution, which was inserted after a referendum in 1983. This clause states: \u201cThe state acknowledges the right to life of the unborn and, with due regard to the equal right to life of the mother, guarantees in its laws to respect, and, as far as practicable, by its laws to defend and vindicate that right.\u201d</p> <p>Before any abortion legislation can be enacted, this amendment (which effectively puts the life of the unborn on a par with the life of the mother) needs to be overturned by referendum.

In the days after that referendum, the question that Irish people hear repeatedly from abroad was raised: how can Ireland have gay marriage and not abortion?

Sir Alex Ferguson never returned to Old Trafford with an opposing team; Bill Shankly never went back to Anfield, and not just because of the restraining order. But Mourinho will return to Stamford Bridge for the first time as manager of another English team.

  "<p></p> <p>On a quiet street in north-west Detroit, it\u2019s become common in recent weeks for onlookers to stop and gawk at Larethia Haddon\u2019s home. For nearly a quarter century, the Detroit native has decorated her front yard for Halloween with a facedown dummy \u2013 a ghoulish tradition that <a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/US/body-detroit-womans-lawn-spooks-onlookers-long-running/story?id=34412107\">drew national attention</a> last year.</p> <p>But as the holiday approached in 2016, Haddon was compelled to shed a typical Halloween display for something far more striking: a scene that portrays <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2015/jun/01/the-counted-police-killings-us-database\">victims of police violence</a>, carjackings and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/20/flint-water-crisis-epa-emergency-order-slow\">lead poisoning in the city of Flint</a>, where Haddon\u2019s family members have dealt with a widespread water crisis for over two years. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/18/flint-water-crisis-lawsuit-special-education-students\">Flint residents sue over alleged denial of special education services to children</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The inspiration, she said, came from her 10 grandchildren.</p> <p>\u201cThey said: we\u2019re not afraid of the boogeyman anymore,\u201d Haddon, 56, told the Guardian. \u201cWe\u2019re afraid of these things that are going on.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>On a brisk fall afternoon, Haddon circled around the yard to give a tour of the display and the dummies, bestowing them with boilerplate nicknames. There\u2019s the \u201cPredator\u201d, a testament to her youngest grandchild\u2019s fear of going outside to play. Nearby, a sign placed against a face-down body reads: \u201cStop killing our children.\u201d Another simply says: \u201cCarjacking.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cCarjacking is one of the biggest crimes in Detroit,\u201d Haddon said. \u201cSenseless. I mean, my God, it\u2019s so senseless.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"70c60cc41a9bfc180b943254f99e1f5ca73fcd23\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/70c60cc41a9bfc180b943254f99e1f5ca73fcd23/0_0_3024_4032/750.jpg\" alt=\"detroit halloween\" width=\"750\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Larethia Haddon sits beside a display in her yard commenting on police violence.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ryan Felton/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Across the yard, an older, bearded male figure with snow white hair was dressed like a disheveled scientist. He stared out to the street, a glass of discolored water in hand, and held a sign that said \u201cFlint water nobody deserves this\u201d.</p> <p>Haddon said her grandchildren have told her they are afraid to drink tap water at their Detroit home because \u201cwe live so close to Flint\u201d.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s just like the sign says: no one deserves to have to ever live that way,\u201d she said.</p> <p>At her doorstep, a blood-stained dummy wore black gloves and a camo jacket with a hood covering his head \u2013 a nod to the spate of police shootings that have sparked protests across the US. His sign: \u201cMy hands were up.\u201d </p> <p>The project has caught the attention of neighbors and passersby. On Friday, a car drove by and stopped to observe the scene; later, a woman carrying a cup of coffee stopped on a walk with her dog, spending a moment in front of each fixture.</p> <p>\u201cAll these things in my yard are reality,\u201d Haddon said. \u201cI\u2019m not trying to offend anyone. I\u2019m trying to make people more aware of the thing that\u2019s going on.\u201d</p> <p>Last year, Haddon\u2019s display drew several 911 calls for reasons she couldn\u2019t explain. \u201cI don\u2019t know why, it didn\u2019t have blood on it or anything, but it really got noticed.\u201d<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>But the response had only been positive this year, she said. Every morning, around 9am, Haddon said, she pulls out the display. She keeps it up until about 8pm \u201cso no one one will steal it\u201d.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>\u201cThey will steal it,\u201d she said. The effort can be taxing for the retired grandmother, who has long had rheumatoid arthritis.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve lost a couple pounds doing it, but it\u2019s OK,\u201d she said with a gentle laugh.<br></p> <p>And her neighbors \u201care so fine with it\u201d, she said. \u201cThey look forward to me coming out with what I\u2019m going to do.\u201d<br></p> <p>The project has touched numerous people, she said, and estimated that hundreds of people had visited her yard in recent weeks.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>\u201cYeah, it\u2019s sinking in; it hits home,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s how it\u2019s affecting people, they\u2019re coming by and saying thank you, hugging me, just doing whatever they can do to say, \u2018Thank you for doing this.\u2019 And I didn\u2019t really expect that.\u201d<br></p> <p>For someone who grew up in a city with a history of crime, the display also has a personal impact. In 2015, Detroit had nearly 300 murders, a figure that places it near the top of the most violent cities in the US.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve lost relatives to shooting, I\u2019ve lost a child of my own \u2013 not at the hands of gunfire or anything, but malpractice,\u201d Haddon said. \u201cAnd dead is dead. You lost your child. I know a couple people who\u2019ve been carjacked. So, it hits home. I\u2019ve been living a lot of years, I\u2019ve seen a lot of things, I have family who lives in Flint, so all this means a lot to me.\u201d<br></p> <p>Every Wednesday this month, members of her church gather at the end of services outside the home, encircle the display, and pray \u201cfor the city of Detroit\u201d, she said.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>But come 1 November, the display will be dismantled, she said. Until then, Haddon hopes her message reverberates across the US.<br></p> <p>\u201cThis is my way of speaking out,\u201d Haddon said. \u201cAnd I just want people to get this message that we\u2019ve got to come together, you know? When you see something going on, don\u2019t just turn your eyes away from it like you don\u2019t see it.\u201d<br></p>",
  "<p>Unless you\u2019ve spent the past three weeks living in the actual wild west, you will have heard of \u2013 if not already become addicted to \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/westworld\" title=\"\">Westworld</a>, HBO\u2019s sci-fi mystery about a theme park populated by sentient robot cowboys. One of the most talked-about elements of the show is its soundtrack, which features old-timey western renditions of rock hits. So far, we\u2019ve been treated to Radiohead and Soundgarden performed on a saloon-bar player piano, and an orchestral version of the Rolling Stones\u2019 Paint It Black, which provided the dramatic soundtrack to a climactic, and gory, gun battle in the show\u2019s opening episode.</p> <p>The man responsible for ageing these contemporary classics is Ramin Djawadi, a German-Iranian composer whose credits include Iron Man and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/aug/15/game-of-thrones-music-live-concert-ramin-djawadi\" title=\"\">Game of Thrones</a>. \u201cI wish it was my idea, but I have to give credit to Jonathan Nolan, my showrunner,\u201d Djawadi explains. \u201cHe came up with the idea of planting these contemporary songs within the show. The audience has responded very well to it; everyone\u2019s talking about it.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"cdc3b3629fdd772134dab4d39ebb4ee6d1bc4901\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cdc3b3629fdd772134dab4d39ebb4ee6d1bc4901/0_0_2079_2145/969.jpg\" alt=\"Westworld composer Ramin Djawadi\" width=\"969\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018The audience has responded very well\u2019 ... Westworld composer Ramin Djawadi.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kevin Winter/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The choice of these tunes isn\u2019t mere crowd-pleasing \u2013 there\u2019s a deeper intention here. In Westworld\u2019s titular theme park, a painstakingly recreated wild west town where human visitors can befriend, have sex with and even kill their droid hosts without guilt or repercussion (at least, that\u2019s the idea), the use of these modern songs acts as a jarring presence. \u201cIt\u2019s a great way of reminding the audience that: \u2018Wait, this is a theme park, you\u2019re not really back in time,\u2019 Djawani explains. \u201cIt just reminds you that something is not right here. It\u2019s all fake.\u201d The fact that these songs are performed on a player piano, an automated device that is in essence a robot itself, adds to this metaphor of creepy artificiality.</p> <p>What\u2019s more, in a show that seems to encourage wild speculation about every detail, from the flies that land on the robot-park workers\u2019 faces to the repeated use of white and black, some are suggesting that Westworld\u2019s musical cues are clues, perhaps indicating where and when the show is set. Are these songs old bar-room classics in a distant future? Or is something else going on? Like those playing poker in Westworld\u2019s saloon, Djawani is keeping his cards close to his chest. \u201cWe\u2019re in the middle of the season, so I don\u2019t want to give anything away. What I can say is that these songs are hooky hits that \u2013 if we are talking about the future \u2013 are still being played 100 years from now, because they are so great.\u201d There\u2019s no arguing with that.</p>",

  "<p>Some years ago, a journalist went to interview Lord Michael and Lady Anne Heseltine about their garden. The woman in question was a poor choice for the job, Lady Heseltine thinks: \u201cI forget her name, but she is married to \u2026 Alan ... Oh, God, the little man who\u2019s slightly in disgrace now, but I imagine that\u2019s why she was given the job.\u201d (She means <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/alan-yentob\">Alan Yentob</a> and his wife Philippa Walker, who, it should be said, has a long and serious list of documentary credits to her name.) \u201cShe didn\u2019t know anything about gardening at all, which was rather a pity, and she kept wanting to bring Michael back to politics. He said: \u2018No, this is the garden, not politics.\u2019 And she didn\u2019t want to talk to me at all.\u201d She laughs brightly, her message artfully transmitted. I run my hand over the list of questions about the state of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/conservatives\">Conservative party</a> and her husband\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/26/fightback-against-brexit-on-cards-remain-eu-referendum-heseltine\">forceful interventions in the Brexit debate</a> that I\u2019ve written down on my way here, smile back, and try to think of something intelligent to say about snowdrops.</p> <p>We\u2019re in a living room at Thenford, the family\u2019s grand Northamptonshire home and venue of the remarkable gardens and arboretum that are a large part of their life\u2019s work. Lord Heseltine isn\u2019t here yet. He\u2019s out there somewhere, I guess, lecturing an errant sapling, as he has acknowledged that he occasionally must, or taking issue with a squirrel. Who knows how long he\u2019ll be: being out in the garden at Thenford is not like being out in most gardens. \u201cBefore we had the golf buggies and mobile phones it was a nightmare,\u201d Lady Heseltine \u2013 can I call her Anne? I don\u2019t risk it \u2013 says. \u201cYou\u2019d spend half the morning looking for him.\u201d They would alert him from the bell tower, and Michael would occasionally return, a little breathless, only to find that the summons was not on behalf of No 10 but from someone offering to clean the windows.</p> <p>The estate runs to about 1,400 acres, and they\u2019ve reinvented it all. \u201cIt is completely barmy,\u201d Anne says. \u201cWe never meant to do it. We never meant to do it.\u201d At that moment, in the driveway visible through the window behind her, I see a rangy 83-year-old in corduroy trousers and purple socks, his luxuriant hair buffeted by the wind, whistling past in a golf buggy. It\u2019s Tarzan, with a hint of Fred Flintstone. An image arrives of a prehistoric political titan, mace in hand, doggedly propelling his stone-age vehicle onwards with his feet. Before Michael has even walked in, it\u2019s obvious that he\u2019d rather be out there than in here.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"ff3b30b165cfc2e6d3c4b86b8e4b2a8abeb88383\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ff3b30b165cfc2e6d3c4b86b8e4b2a8abeb88383/0_0_5616_3744/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018It is completely barmy.

With the Tarzan-and-Jane era more or less behind them \u2013 while he was swinging that mace in the cabinet and carving out a niche as the best Conservative prime minister that never was, she was on the boards of four major museums \u2013 the Heseltines have finally written the book that they have talked about for years. So, OK, you win, Heseltines. Fine. We\u2019ll start with the garden.</p> <p><a href=\"http://headofzeus.com/books/thenford\">Thenford</a> is an account of a horticultural transformation from a neglected wilderness, where \u201cold trees remained where they had fallen, like sticks in a giant\u2019s game of spillikins\u201d, to great English gardens. It features useful advice, hearty family photos and the odd entertaining political anecdote, but mostly it\u2019s a monument to an undertaking that, whatever they were doing in London, you cannot help feeling was their real calling.</p> <p>When they came here in 1977, the Heseltines hadn\u2019t quite reckoned with the scale of the project. \u201cThe plan was the house rather than the garden, wasn\u2019t it?\u201d says Anne. \u201cWe were not looking for the garden,\u201d says Michael, who has sat down in an enormous armchair next to his wife, with an appealingly shabby 16-year-old sausage dog called Casper at his feet. \u201cThere was an assumption that there would be a garden already there. But we never thought we would find a broken down wood, which is what we got.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"2b6e510f04cfe19164543a1633396c72e46673ef\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2b6e510f04cfe19164543a1633396c72e46673ef/0_0_3672_2687/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Heseltines moving into their prior Nettlebed home.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"732\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Heseltines moving into their prior Nettlebed home.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Hulton Deutsch/Corbis via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cWe did it bit by bit,\u201d Anne goes on. \u201cUsually, we completed one section, and then we thought: what\u2019s next? We started with an aviary, then there was this little stream, and then we made some ponds \u2026\u201d On the list goes. They did once decide against building a bridge because of the expense, but that appears to be about the only economy, which is probably not that surprising when you consider that this year\u2019s Sunday Times <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/rich-lists\">Rich List</a> estimated the fortune they have accumulated via Haymarket publishing at \u00a3300m. He swiped cuttings from the prime minister\u2019s country retreat, Chequers (Edward Heath visited, as did John Major, David Cameron, the American ambassador during the Westland affair, Prince Charles, and any number of other grandees; Margaret Thatcher never did), and she chose sculptures by Lynn Chadwick and Elisabeth Frink. A <a href=\"http://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/3982038\">massive bust of Lenin</a>, rescued from the former Soviet Union at the end of the cold war was meant to cost \u20ac2,000; when the dealer sheepishly explained that he had left a zero off the end of the price, they rolled their eyes and bought it anyway. The garden itself, meanwhile, is entirely their own. Today, there are about 13,000 varieties of plant catalogued here, among them 3,000 trees and shrubs in the arboretum, 400 different roses, 370 oaks and 342 snowdrops, which, I am almost certain, are those little white ones.</p> <p>The house and its owners have the same careless, unapologetic grandeur as the gardens. I don\u2019t mean to be crass, but Michael Heseltine\u2019s loo is an actual throne: a gigantic wooden chair with arms and a wicker seat that you have to lift to discover its true purpose. There are many beautiful things, as well as a bobblehead of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/george-bush\">George W Bush</a>. The Heseltines, for their part, have a laconic, almost indetectable haughtiness to their excellent manners. There is, for example, no indication that they\u2019ve registered my name. I quite like them for it, to be honest. They are here to talk about the garden, which they love fiercely, and they are not that interested in discussing anything else \u2013 certainly not politics, as we have seen (although they will, after a slight hesitation, reveal the time that Michael punched a drunk in the face).</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"6522ff4f3af98faeecd5c74771677cd7a3099f6e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6522ff4f3af98faeecd5c74771677cd7a3099f6e/0_0_3744_5616/667.jpg\" alt=\"The \u00a320,000 bust of Lenin.\" width=\"667\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The \u00a320,000 bust of Lenin.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tom Pilston for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But that\u2019s later. For now, they\u2019re describing the consequences of their great project\u2019s exposure to the world with some of the same reluctance. At the moment, they open the gardens to the public four times a year; with the book, Anne says: \u201cI\u2019m not sure what\u2019s going to happen. I think we will have to be open more than four times a year, don\u2019t you? Otherwise the garden will be trampled to bits.\u201d At the thought, I surmise, of large family groups with screaming toddlers and a pram carving its way across the grass, a cloud crosses Michael\u2019s face. \u201cThe website is coming,\u201d he says ominously, sounding like the voiceover on a trailer for a horror film called The Website. \u201cWe can see how it goes.\u201d Yes, he admits, there is trepidation at the prospect. \u201cBeing open is a new dimension, and it starts with things called loos, and teas, and gates, and\u201d \u2013 he italicises his dismay \u2013 \u201c<em>choke points</em>.\u201d</p> <p>Anyway, even without such chaos, there are already some interlopers in paradise. One of the statistics that stuck with me from the book, I say, was that the Heseltines have shot a genocidal 300 grey squirrels for the protection of small birds and trees in just six months. Three hundred! It\u2019s a massacre out there. \u201cThree hundred and fifty,\u201d Michael corrects me. \u201cAbsolutely awful things,\u201d says Anne. Taken though I am with the image of Tarzan taking potshots from the golf buggy, I suspect it\u2019s probably mostly the work of Thenford\u2019s dozen gardeners. Still, Michael bows to no one in his antipathy for the little buggers. \u201cThese foreign intruders may have a Walt Disney appeal in London parks,\u201d he writes \u2013 the couple take alternating chapters \u2013 \u201cbut to us they are Public Enemy Number One \u2026 and are shot without hesitation.\u201d He is variously \u201cenraged\u201d and \u201caggravated\u201d by their presence. But now they are on the run and, as a result, says Anne, \u201cwe are hearing and seeing all sorts of birds that we didn\u2019t before.\u201d In such idyllic circumstances, the Heseltines are more enamoured of their garden than ever, and more determined to spend as much time there as they can. \u201cI can tell you exactly when I feel it most,\u201d Michael says, \u201con a cold January day when I\u2019m out shooting, and I say to myself: \u2018Why am I doing this?\u2019 All those lovely greenhouses, and I\u2019m here.\u201d</p> <p>If all this \u2013 anxiety at the influx of the great unwashed; shooting; that throne \u2013 give an impression of elitism, the Heseltines are bracingly unconcerned. It makes you nostalgic for a certain stripe of patrician Conservative, now in short supply, who viewed the sensible stewardship of the nation as their natural responsibility, and didn\u2019t much care if they seemed remote in exercising it. It would be harder to get away with on the front lines of politics now, wouldn\u2019t it? In the post <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2009/may/23/mps-expenses-conservatives\">duck-island-era</a>, a life like this would come with a political price. Not a bit of it, says Michael. \u201cYou have just got to believe in what you are doing. Anyway, there is a huge gardening world out there. And I would much rather have them on my side than the journalists.\u201d</p> <p>Feeling embarrassed about my firm position in the latter camp, I talk ruefully about my own back garden, whose state of disrepair can be summarised by the ominous weed that keeps sliding in under the back door. \u201cThey are not toys,\u201d Michael says solemnly. \u201cThey are very demanding. Well, you can pave it.\u201d A thought occurs to him, and he looks a bit surprised. \u201cThere is something I want to clarify,\u201d he announces. \u201cAre you the gardening correspondent of the Guardian?\u201d No, I\u2019m not. \u201cOh,\u201d he replies. \u201cI thought you were.\u201d He sits back and narrows his eyes.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2623419fdc48a11db3618c6969c8188a382aee38\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2623419fdc48a11db3618c6969c8188a382aee38/0_273_3504_2102/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Margaret Thatcher with Michael Heseltine.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Margaret Thatcher with Michael Heseltine.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Manchester Daily Express/SSPL via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I look back down at my notes about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/eu-referendum\">Brexit</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/theresamay\">Theresa May</a>. Is it all right if I ask a couple of political questions? \u201cYou can try,\u201d he says. Now Anne, too, has a distinctly sceptical look; despite the tea and biscuits recently provided by a servant summoned by telephone, the atmosphere has chilled. Oh, well. I\u2019m trying to link the garden\u2019s impervious, permanent beauty to the state of chaos around the country when Michael cuts me off. \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/26/fightback-against-brexit-on-cards-remain-eu-referendum-heseltine\">My views are quite well known</a> on the referendum,\u201d he says. (They are both firm remainers.) \u201cWe know what happened in the referendum. But no one knows what is going to happen as a consequence. We will see.\u201d</p> <p>He waits. Anne sips her tea. We\u2019re meeting the day after David Cameron\u2019s former spin doctor <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/25/brexit-books-david-cameron-theresa-may-party-split\">Craig Oliver\u2019s incendiary diaries</a> were splashed across the Mail on Sunday, revealing the bitter divides that the referendum created in the government, and putting the boot into Brexiteers such as Boris Johnson. What did Oliver\u2019s account tell us about the leaders of the leave campaign? \u201cThey did what they believed in, and the consequences will one day be evident,\u201d Michael says, and falls silent again. When he does elaborate, he moves with impressive efficiency into the weeds of policy. A question about the social effects of the division provokes a lively discussion of whether a friend called Susie was leave or remain but, otherwise, the subtext of every answer is clear: why is this question not about our garden?</p> <p>At this point, something slightly surprising happens. Accepting that the killer line about Boris that I had secretly hoped for is not about to materialise <strong>\u2013</strong> I mean, earlier this year <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/30/lord-heseltine-slams-boris-johnson-abandoning-army\">Michael described his Henley constituency successor as</a> \u201ca general who marches his army to the sound of the guns and the moment he sees the battleground he abandons it\u201d, for God\u2019s sake \u2013 I find myself babbling out of awkwardness. I should, I hear myself saying, have asked the question a friend once advised me would get an interesting response out of anyone: have you ever thrown a punch? We all cheer up a bit. \u201cI don\u2019t think I have, actually,\u201d says Michael, but Anne is on hand to correct him. \u201cYou did! You did!\u201d she cries. \u201cDon\u2019t you remember? You were coming back from the House of Commons, and a man approached you. He was drunk or druggy or something.

Active though they still are, their richest life now is in the confines of Thenford, basking in the splendour of the blooming world they have made for themselves (and, just occasionally, for others).

  "<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2016/aug/02/rob-drummond-in-fidelity-edinburgh-festival\">Rob Drummond</a>  never fails to surprise. Last summer in Edinburgh in In Fidelity, he persuaded two members of the audience at every performance to date live on stage. His <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2016/oct/09/the-broons-review-adam-smith-theatre-kirkcaldy-comic-strip-sell-a-door\">stage version of the cartoon strip The Broons</a>  is currently out on tour, and in Grain in the Blood he employs a sturdy thriller format, full of edge-of-your seat tension and all the requisite plot twists, to explore whether the ends ever justify the means and ask if doing wrong is ever the right thing to do.</p> <p>The ethics are neatly shrouded in layers of old-fashioned entertainment in a drama that takes us to an isolated rural community still steeped in folklore. It\u2019s a place where once on the harvest moon the villagers made a blood sacrifice to the ancient <a href=\"http://www.sacred-texts.com/pag/frazer/gb04500.htm\">Grain Mother</a>  to ensure health and happiness, and where blood has been spilled in more recent memory. The farmhouse home of retired vet Sophia (Blythe Duff), who believes \u201cwe\u2019re all animals\u201d, is a place haunted by the past and by the sickness of her 12-year-old granddaughter, Autumn, who is dying of kidney cancer.<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fb3c170a406374312dd3cf8fac391fa1f0e79176\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fb3c170a406374312dd3cf8fac391fa1f0e79176/0_383_6000_3600/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Moral duty \u2026 released prisoner Isaac (Andrew Rothney) in Grain in the Blood.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Moral duty \u2026 released prisoner Isaac (Andrew Rothney) in Grain in the Blood.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mihaela Bodlovic</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But Sophia and Violet, who lives at the farm and carries her own griefs buried deep inside, are about to have a visitor, Isaac, a prisoner released from jail for the weekend on compassionate grounds.

  "<p>Downing Street officials were alarmed to discover that David Cameron had a holding in a Vietnamese investment fund registered in the Cayman Islands at the height of the Panama Papers revelations, according to a book by his former director of communications. </p> <p>Sir Craig Oliver became aware that the then prime minister had previously invested \u201cin something called the Vietnamese Enterprise Fund\u201d <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2016/apr/03/what-you-need-to-know-about-the-panama-papers\">following the Guardian\u2019s investigation</a> into the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2016/apr/08/mossack-fonseca-law-firm-hide-money-panama-papers\">Panamanian law firm Mossack Fonseca</a>. The information was not released to the media at the time, after Oliver and his team decided: \u201cWe think it\u2019s fine, but what if it\u2019s not?\u201d</p> <p>The Vietnam Enterprise Fund is run by Dragon Capital in Vietnam, but registered in the Cayman Islands. Dominic Scriven, the chief executive of Dragon Capital, confirmed that Cameron had previously invested in the fund, and believed his father, Ian Cameron, had decided to invest the money.</p> <p>In <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/oct/17/unleashing-demons-inside-story-brexit-craig-oliver-david-cameron-review\">his book Unleashing Demons</a>, Oliver said the Downing Street office uncovered Cameron\u2019s investment in the fund following the release of the Panama Papers by the Guardian, working with the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists and German newspaper S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung.</p> <p>The papers revealed that Ian Cameron <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2016/apr/04/panama-papers-david-cameron-father-tax-bahamas\">helped found an offshore fund</a> called Blairmore Holdings. His son was forced into a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2016/apr/07/david-cameron-admits-he-profited-fathers-offshore-fund-panama-papers\">series of embarrassing disclosures</a> over several days, including the fact that he had personally owned shares in Blairmore.</p> <p>Cameron was photographed with Scriven during a visit to Vietnam in July 2015. At the time, Dragon Capital\u2019s website said: \u201cDominic Scriven OBE, CEO of Dragon Capital, attended lunch with the prime minister and also accompanied him to the stock exchange and other important meetings.\u201d</p> <p>In an attempt to control the story in April, Downing Street brought in a series of experts to try to make sense of Blairmore\u2019s tax affairs, Oliver\u2019s book said. They also carried out an analysis of Cameron\u2019s personal tax arrangements and it was during this that the Vietnam Enterprise Fund investment emerged.</p> <p>Oliver wrote: \u201cA few of us gather round the table in my office and begin the process of working out the release of the PM\u2019s tax returns. The fact is that we\u2019re utter novices in this world.\u201d</p> <p>They then discovered the investment. Oliver wrote: \u201cWe\u2019re told it\u2019s perfectly legitimate, but will the lobby see it that way? We think it\u2019s fine, but what if it\u2019s not?\u201d</p> <p>It is not clear why Oliver included the information in his book. He declined to comment. </p> <p>At the time, Cameron was facing one of the worst crises of his premiership, with Oliver acknowledging that at one point, he thought the then prime minister <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/20/david-camerons-adviser-feared-panama-papers-would-end-bosss-career\">might have to resign</a> over the Panama Papers. </p> <p>Oliver wrote that Cameron and his wife, Samantha, had \u201can unhappy couple of hours in calls\u201d with their accountant, before putting out a statement saying that the \u201cprime minister, his wife and their children do not benefit from any offshore funds\u201d.</p>",
  "<p>The Financial Conduct Authority is investigating a \u00a33.6m sale of shares to small investors in a company claiming to revive the Our Price records brand.</p> <p>Our Price was Britain\u2019s second-biggest chain of music stores in the mid-1980s, but after a series of owners, its last shop closed in 2004. The brand was acquired by Lee Skinner, who has attached it to short-lived businesses such as Our Price Furniture and Our Price TV.</p> <p>Investors have not lost money in the transaction, although the cash is being held in a third-party escrow account. The FCA is allowing Our Price to use limited funds, but large-scale spending is barred to protect shareholders.</p> <p>Early last year, Skinner sought to raise \u00a31.5m by offering shares to private investors in a new company, Our Price Records Ltd, at 60p a share, valuing the company at \u00a310.5m. After a second round of share sales, Our Price raised \u00a33.6m.<br></p> <p>Despite using the Our Price name and logo, the company was not seeking to tap into <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/aug/12/vinyl-destination-who-is-actually-buying-records\">the vinyl revival</a>. Instead, Skinner said he would use the well-known brand to become a force in online retailing, as a shop window for discounted goods from leading brands.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://beta.companieshouse.gov.uk/company/04792445/filing-history\">share prospectus said</a> the company would use the funds to launch its website and pay for advertising. It said the \u201cexit plan\u201d was to list on the stock market or sell to a trade buyer for \u00a3100m within three years. </p> <p>In late 2015, the FCA started examining the share sale and in January 2016, the regulator wrote to shareholders to say it was investigating. </p> <p>Skinner wrote to shareholders on 27 April saying Our Price\u2019s problems stemmed from its accountants, Leigh Carr, not being authorised to approve the prospectus. </p> <p>The FCA wrote to shareholders on 3 May saying Leigh Carr\u2019s lack of authority was \u201conly one facet of our investigation\u201d and that it was examining whether unauthorised sales agents breached company law, whether Our Price knew about any breaches, and the accuracy of promotional material sent to consumers.</p> <p>Skinner told the Guardian that he was ready to launch the business in January and the FCA investigation had prevented him from doing so.<br></p> <p>\u201cEverything as far as I\u2019m concerned has been done totally legitimately with the objective of a flotation or a trade sale within three years, once Our Price had rebuilt itself. That was always and still is the objective,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Leigh Carr did not respond to requests for comment. The FCA declined to comment. </p> <p>Our Price\u2019s prospectus said it would receive commission on discounted products offered through its website. It said there were \u201carrangements in place\u201d with more than 250 big brands, including John Lewis, Marks &amp; Spencer and easyJet holidays. <br></p> <p>The prospectus projected sales of \u00a31.9m in the first year of business, rising to \u00a318.8m two years later, and for pre-tax profit to soar from \u00a3424,404 to \u00a317.4m in the same period.</p> <p><a href=\"https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/document-api-images-prod/docs/t-2ofVIzNJP339K3JD6q4OZGv1ABzB6Dzt1C2Kf48cU/application-pdf?AWSAccessKeyId=ASIAIWLKODZN5M44RN3A&amp;Expires=1474793348&amp;Signature=vzHV02J9f%2B91na%2FVSsFztmbsVgE%3D&amp;x-amz-security-token=FQoDYXdzELr%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2FwEaDFXjnP5EsSQ7wqMI4yKcAw9%2BbOEi94%2FHWz%2BTvGKrsadPxQ%2F4sKknkHzNJ%2B8WDSmTh8TXPaObiWYwdodUpG2GWQN7CreaZeV91eNqb3%2FuDDczETfSEN1yWZWtqcOKtcZqqzYHhd7tTvnqD3ulPQGfh2Er4mAPez5QCAf58sjRAjH9NkSKLnJs1yFQLdeXx5Q9nf90zP23dkRAoaStYeVwqzBo1sKt5oUMXHfwkf6FCGqNQ3sXYke%2BOnfKe5lPpPfbE0WVNh%2FBOJl%2BZAZAuM9nIsBuh%2F5ufDyQWOhMgqXcefUcodbLwQuV18PvcHc9I7UHhwYWZphES%2FODhLfgUqF3RF7Tjzmy9uKYSsl35GNKvNFdsfjK0LVdjy8Pm782wLFk65yVKECZ4JSSxQgcMpflnXrALb1z2fQWrfZ3TF%2FL61ZUdE5Na7802w%2F%2BuK09xX5vzIIBDKfJj1S7G%2Bydk2XFX3UnjjX4T2pMEdbV0btKRY1r9dwSRMgENzMwSH2GhnPudtMBsfH8NNv6RiftGclCxAxEy5F16eJOG0ncGdB5V5V4vlU1O7CcQWUO7B4o8pievwU%3D\">Our Price\u2019s annual return</a>, filed in June, showed 260 investors had bought 4.9m shares at 60p or \u00a31 a share.

  "<p>A voluptuous portrait of Emma Hamilton, commissioned by her husband and later bought by her lover Lord Nelson to save it from the shame of a public sale, is to be displayed in a major exhibition on her extraordinary life.</p> <p>\u201cShe was a really remarkable person, who has usually been seen only in the shadows of the men in her life. It is time to bring her back into the light,\u201d said Quintin Colville, curator of the exhibition that opens at the National Maritime Museum in Greenwich, London, next month.</p> <p>The portrait has been in private collections since it was completed, and has not been exhibited in the UK for almost half a century.<br></p> <p>Colville, like many men before him, has fallen heavily for Emma, the blacksmith\u2019s daughter who became an aristocratic diplomat\u2019s wife and the mistress of one of the most famous men of the day. He told the Guardian he finds it hard to forgive the artist, \u00c9lisabeth Louise <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2015/nov/15/vigee-le-brun-painter-french-royalty\">Vig\u00e9e Le Brun</a>, for being so rude about Emma, who had been typically kind to her when Vig\u00e9e Le Brun came to the Naples court as a refugee from the French Revolution.</p> <p>Emma was far more famous in that circle than Vig\u00e9e Le Brun, and was renowned for her \u201cattitudes\u201d, theatrical exhibitions of poses drawn from classical art and literature, including her husband\u2019s famous collection of Greek vases. Her performances were essential viewing for visitors to Naples, including the German writer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/johann-wolfgang-von-goethe\">Goethe</a>, who described her as \u201cexceedingly beautiful\u201d, and said she brought the ancient world to life \u201cas if one were in some dream\u201d.</p> <p> In 1791, Sir William Hamilton took the then Emma Hart as his mistress from his nephew and then married her when he was 61 and she was 26. The blacksmith\u2019s daughter became Lady Hamilton, an ambassador\u2019s wife and society hostess. Many regarded the match as shocking, but it was nothing to the scandal that followed. When a wounded Nelson came to convalesce in Naples, Lady Hamilton nursed him back to health and the two fell passionately in love. Instead of throwing her out and challenging Nelson to a duel, her husband remained on affectionate terms with both of them.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1b24c0147c3f998d7f2a5bb748d3260e587ebd3f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1b24c0147c3f998d7f2a5bb748d3260e587ebd3f/0_0_6049_4954/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A devotional book Emma Hamilton gave to Horatia\" width=\"1000\" height=\"819\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A devotional book Emma Hamilton gave to Horatia, her daughter by Nelson, is among the objects on display.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jon Stokes/National Maritime Museum</span> </figcaption> </figure> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2016/feb/12/vigee-le-brun-metropolitan-museum-of-art-woman-artist-revolutionary-france\">Vig\u00e9e Le Brun: artist to the aristocracy who played and changed the game</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cHamilton greatly admired Nelson, and he was unquestionably extremely fond of Emma. He didn\u2019t want to lose her, he was getting old, and I think he wanted a comfortable life spending time with his collections and his books, surrounded by people he liked,\u201d Colville said.<br></p> <p>The portrait shows Lady Hamilton as either a bacchante or Ariadne, daughter of King Minos of Crete in Greek mythology. Colville notes her expression of sleepy satisfaction, and the little ship sailing away in the background, and wonders if there is a sly reference to Nelson.</p> <p>Vig\u00e9e Le Brun went on to paint many more highly saleable portraits of Hamilton \u2013 who was already the muse and favourite model of <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2002/jun/02/1\">the artist George Romney</a> \u2013 and said of her: \u201cI could have copied her different poses ... and filled a gallery with paintings.\u201d</p> <p>However, she also wrote in her diary: \u201cLady Hamilton was not very intelligent, though she was exceedingly mocking and denigrating, to the point that her faults were her only means of conversation. But she was cunning, and this helped her to snare a husband.\u201d</p> <p>The exhibition will include many loans from private collections, including touchingly modest objects that belonged to Lady Hamilton, which have never been displayed before. Almost everything she owned was scattered in sales after Nelson died at Trafalgar in 1805, two years after Sir William. She ended up poorer than when she was born, having been released from a debtor\u2019s prison to die penniless in Calais in 1815.</p> <p>The objects will include a little needle book with nautical scenes owned by Horatia, her daughter by Nelson, and a devotional book she gave her, inscribed \u201ca life well spent makes old age pleasant and honourable\u201d, but signed \u201cEmma Hamilton\u201d rather than as her mother.</p> <p>Both Sir William and Nelson loved the Vig\u00e9e Le Brun portrait. Sir William left a miniature version to Nelson in his will, \u201ca very small token of the great regard I have for his Lordship, the most virtuous, loyal and truly brave character I ever met with\u201d. Nelson, when he learned the original was to be sold, wrote to Lady Hamilton: \u201cMy dearest friend you are on SALE: I am almost mad to think of the iniquity.\u201d He paid \u00a3300 for it, and kept it over his bed for the rest of his life.</p> <p>\u2022 <a href=\"http://www.rmg.co.uk/see-do/emma-hamilton-seduction-and-celebrity\">Emma Hamilton, Seduction and Celebrity</a> runs from 3 November 2016 to 17 April 2017.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 24 October 2016.

  "<p>Once the preserve of monastic retreats and hardcore meditators, simply being quiet is growing in appeal. Whole businesses have sprung up to meet a rising demand for quiet time, from silent weekend getaways to silent dining, silent reading parties and even silent dating. This month sees the release of documentary In Pursuit of Silence, a \u201cmeditative film\u201d about our relationship with noise, promoted with a delicate two-minute trailer in which not a word is uttered.</p> <p>Silence can, as the film attests, mean different things to different people. It can be a space for quiet reflection or a state fraught with discomfort. There is a certain intimacy inherent in being silent with other people \u2013 we usually do so only with those closest to us. So there is something almost radical about the recent trend for enjoying silence with strangers.</p> <p>Mariel Symeonidou started a regular silent reading party in Dundee just under a year ago, in a moment of \u201cuncharacteristic extroversion\u201d. Readers bring their books and meet in a bar, where they read together in silence for an hour or sometimes two, then put the books away to chat and have a drink.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7e0b51e9b369c78a434d467251ca4724fa9e7394\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7e0b51e9b369c78a434d467251ca4724fa9e7394/0_72_2953_1773/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Meditating in Australia.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Meditating in Australia.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Fairfax Media/Fairfax Media via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The concept began in the dimly lit, retro-furnished cafes and bars of Seattle. Devised as a literary hangout for those who don\u2019t like spoken-word nights or discussion groups, the premise was simple: show up, shut up and read. The trend has spread to New York and since found a home in the UK, in London and Edinburgh as well as Dundee.</p> <p>\u201cWhen the reading starts, everything goes quiet,\u201d says Symeonidou. \u201cIt\u2019s a little bit surreal, especially in what is usually a bustling bar. However, there is something special about sharing that silence with others. It offers an opportunity for escapism; everyone is so busy with work and with technology being ever present. An event like this gives people the opportunity to escape these things for a while.\u201d</p> <p>While the readings are now tranquil and relaxed, Mariel concedes initial iterations were a little awkward. This discomfort is precisely where the radical power of silence lies, says Matthew Adams, a lecturer in psychology at the University of Brighton. \u201cSilence is often something we experience as uncomfortable, as a rupture in the social fabric, an awkwardness we want to cover over with our voices.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/may/26/five-of-the-best-meditation-apps\">Five of the best meditation apps</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Adams has a long-term interest in the social, cultural and psychological significance of silence, and particularly in shared silence and electing to share silence. \u201cCollective silence is about connecting with others in a way that gets underneath social conventions. It confronts us with what it feels like to be in the physical presence of other human beings without any games, strategies, reading or misreading of intentions. It is a temporary suspension of our reliance on talk.\u201d</p> <p>The absence of chatter can have social advantages. London\u2019s silent speed-dating event organisers Shhh! say that we are \u201cinstinctively better at communicating and choosing the right partners when we have the chance to put aside words and see each other as we really are\u201d.</p> <p>Shhh! hosts regular speed-dating sessions and singles events, featuring \u201cnon-verbal flirting games\u201d and \u201ceye-gazing\u201d; neatly side-stepping all the what-are-you-watching-on-Netflix questions. Claimed to be a favourite with \u201ccreative professionals in their 20s and 30s\u201d, Shhh! boasts a busy programme of events until the end of the year. The sessions begin with games to break the ice, including jumping around in front of a potential mate and making \u201cpaleolithic noises\u201d. Then comes a somewhat standard speed-dating set-up; attendees are paired off for a limited window of time, communicating only with gestures, before engaging in 60 seconds of uninterrupted eye contact. After the event you are dutifully furnished with the contact details of interested parties and if you\u2019re lucky enough to land a second date, you can maintain the established embargo on chit-chat, whisking them off for a silent dinner date or a mute trip to the pictures.</p> <p>Honi Ryan is an artist based in Berlin who began hosting silent dinners back in 2006. An otherwise ordinary dinner party setup, albeit with a ritzy vegan menu (regular dishes include baked almond soy mushrooms and Lebanese beans), the rules of the dinner are: no talking, no using your voice, no reading or writing, try to make as little noise as possible, do not interact with technology, and stay for at least two hours.</p> <p>Ryan describes the silent dinners as \u201csocial sculptures\u201d engaging with \u201cthe changing nature of communication and the space between people\u201d. So far she has taken her silent dining project to Mexico, the US, Australia, Lebanon and China. The global reach is fundamental to the project, as is the inclusive and international menu. \u201cIt\u2019s evident that the age-old connections we make over food do not depend on the words around it. \u201cSilence creates the space for the people and places involved to fill with whatever is needed; it strips away our rehearsed social behaviours.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"30bf91fad24ed1c552657eb508e03e13740cda95\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/30bf91fad24ed1c552657eb508e03e13740cda95/56_0_2250_1350/1000.jpg\" alt=\"In Pursuit of Silence \u2026 the art of finding stillness within yourself.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">In Pursuit of Silence \u2026 the art of finding stillness within yourself.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR Company Handout</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Perhaps the most well-known silent social is the silent retreat. Recently featured in an episode of BBC comedy Fleabag, silent retreats vary in tone and purpose, and are more popular than you might imagine. The retreats often have a religious or spiritual element, with Buddhist, Christian and Catholic retreats making up the majority. They can last anywhere between a couple of days to a few weeks, set in locations that are usually fittingly pastoral, in old farm buildings or country piles.</p> <p>Silent retreat regular Peter Cadney first discovered the power of silence on a 10-day vipassana silent meditation course, in 2013. The technique emphasises developing a connection with silence and accessing the \u201cstillness\u201d within yourself.</p> <p>\u201cThere had been a number of events in my life that I hadn\u2019t been able to deal with very well; things like relationship breakups and the death of a close friend. I\u2019d spent years working at a computer and was feeling the effects of muscle tension, anxiety and stress. I felt drawn to finding somewhere quiet to sit in order to find peace within myself.\u201d</p> <p>Cadney says silent meditation has helped to improve both his mental and physical health. \u201cWhen I first sat down in silence, it felt very peaceful. I started noticing just how many thoughts were coming and going in my mind, it was as if there had been no space for silence.\u201d</p> <p>Cadney has since given up his office job and now works as a holistic therapist. \u201cAs soon as I sat down in that meditation hall I thought: this is where I am supposed to be.\u201d</p> <p>Swiss Artist Salome Voegelin also found a purpose in silence. However, rather than finding silence soothing or nulling somehow, it instead opened her mind to the \u201cradical possibility of hearing\u201d. She describes silence, not as the absence of sound, but as the beginning of listening, though she has some reservations about the \u201cegotistical tendencies\u201d of the current trend for silent getaways.</p> <p>\u201cWhile these events are contemplative and respectful, I wonder how much of the silent listening is spent obsessing about one\u2019s own silence rather than hearing others and the environment,\u201d she says.</p> <p>Voeglin\u2019s book, Listening to Noise and Silence: Towards a Philosophy of Sound Art posits silence and noise not as opposites but as different ends of the same spectrum. \u201cThere is no true silence. It\u2019s a state that allows me to hear my breathing in tandem with yours, the rumbling of my stomach, the gurgling of the radiator. It provides a time out. It\u2019s when we start to listen to each other.\u201d</p> <p>Silence assumes a new meaning in an era in which we are consuming information and engaging in conversation with each other endlessly, without ever opening our mouths. While we may watch The Pursuit of Silence and enjoy the absence of sound, how many of us will be tempted to check in with our emails, tweet our thoughts on the film? While we might find pleasure in those rare and cherished moments of peace and quiet, when it comes to silence and stillness, can we muster up the self-restraint at all?</p> <p><em>In Pursuit of Silence is on release now.</em></p>",

The big bang also meant the scrapping of fixed commissions on share dealing and of ancient distinctions between stockbrokers, who advised clients, and jobbers, who bought and sold shares on their behalf. </p> <p>Thatcher\u2019s government regarded the previous set-up as anti-competitive and inefficient and wanted the City to adopt new technology to compete as finance went global.</p> <p> \u201cIt was an anachronism that had had its day,\u201d said Nigel Boardman, a partner at the law firm Slaughter and May, who began working at his firm in the 70s and was a partner by the time the big bang arrived.</p> <p> The effect was to make many small City firms obsolete as the most prestigious were snapped up by US investment banks and rivals from Switzerland, Germany and elsewhere. The City boomed as London became a global financial centre, bridging the time zones of the Americas and Asia and allowing foreign banks access to the EU. This year it has even <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jul/04/lse-shareholders-expected-to-back-deutsche-borse-merger-london-stock-exchange\">led to an attempt to merge the London Stock Exchange and Deutsche B\u00f6rse</a>.<br></p> <p>Job numbers rose. In early 1986, financial services employed 976,000 people in Britain, government figures show. By 1990 the number had jumped to 1.18 million and it peaked at 1.21 million in 2008. Today, even after the financial crisis and 30 years of automation and cost cuts, there are 1.15 million people employed in finance \u2013 174,000 more than before the big bang.</p> <p>Richard Lumb, chief executive of Accenture\u2019s global financial services business, said it also democratised share ownership \u2013 and brought in \u00a365bn of tax revenues. This was one of the benefits of the bonus culture that took over the City in the wake of the big bang.</p> <p>\u201cBrexit will change the City in some ways,\u201d said Lumb. \u201cBut I\u2019m more optimistic than pessmistic.\u201d He pointed to factors such as the skilled workforce in London and the tax and legal environment.</p> <p>The lobby group <a href=\"http://www.oliverwyman.com/content/dam/oliver-wyman/global/en/2016/oct/Brexit_POV.PDF\">TheCityUK has calculated that \u201chard Brexit\u201d</a> \u2013 in which the UK does not have access to the single market of the remaining 27 EU countries \u2013 could put 35,000 jobs at risk.</p> <p>Boardman, though, sees some positives from leaving the EU \u2013 for instance, freeing the City from a tax on financial transactions that is being introduced in 10 European countries or <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/mar/04/bankers-bonus-cap-architect-says-sue-uk-government\">the cap on bonuses that has forced up City salaries</a>. \u201cOn the other hand, if financial passporting is lost that would be adverse \u2026 If you already have offices in the EU it may be you can more easily manage the loss of the passport \u2026 but if you don\u2019t it could be more difficult.\u201d</p> <p>Previous anniversaries of the big bang have also coincided with controversies. In 2011, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2011/oct/09/big-bang-1986-city-deregulation-boom-bust\">the 25-year milestone was marked by soul searching about the impact that the implosion of the banking sector</a> had had on the economy and inequality.</p> <p>But, Boardman said, the current controversy about financial services post-Brexit is about more than just London. \u201cThe future of the City is an extremely important thing for the country and I don\u2019t think we should talk about it as the future of the City. It\u2019s the future of the country to a very significant extent because the whole country benefits from the City\u2019s activities.\u201d<br></p>",

Running through Trump\u2019s controversial statements \u2013 calling Mexican immigrants \u201crapists\u201d and \u201ckillers\u201d, questioning Barack Obama\u2019s birth, picking a fight with the parents of an Iraq war hero, his behavior toward women \u2013 Clinton asked voters why their senator was still undecided.</p> <p>\u201cHow much more does Pat Toomey need to hear?\u201d she said. \u201cIf he doesn\u2019t have the courage to stand up to Donald Trump after all this, can you be sure he will have the courage to stand up for you when it counts?\u201d</p> <p>She also lavished praise on McGinty, who is in a dead heat with Toomey. An aide to Clinton said to expect similar arguments against other vulnerable Republican senators, such as Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire, Ron Johnson of Wisconsin and Marco Rubio of Florida.</p> <p>Democrats need to gain at least four seats to retake the Senate if Clinton wins, in which case Kaine would serve as a tiebreaker. Priorities USA, a pro-Clinton super pac, is investing in states including New Hampshire and Pennsylvania, planning to tie embattled Republicans to Trump.</p> <p>Ted Kwong, a spokesman for Toomey\u2019s campaign, said Clinton\u2019s speech was \u201cfurther proof that hyper-partisan, ethically challenged Katie McGinty will be a rubber stamp for everything Hillary Clinton wants to do in Washington.</p> <p>\u201cPat Toomey has been and will continue to be an independent leader in the Senate on issues ranging from gun safety to ending Wall Street bailouts.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>\u2018We\u2019ve been very fortunate\u2019</strong></h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/oct/23/trump-threatens-to-sue-sexual-assault-accusers-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/58mdg\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2831074\"            data-video-name=\"Trump threatens to sue sexual assault accusers \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"Reuters\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-580c1820e4b05ae7c6c56138\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/10/23/161023trumpsue_h264_publish.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=11733820&amp;format=video/m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=11733820&amp;format=video/webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/oct/23/trump-threatens-to-sue-sexual-assault-accusers-video\">Trump threatens to sue sexual assault accusers</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>Republican strategists concede that if Clinton\u2019s lead grows, their hopes of holding on to the Senate will diminish.</p> <p>For a change in the House, which the Democrats lost in the 2010 midterms, 30 seats must fall.

A person who once listened to Radiohead\u2019s first album, didn\u2019t like it and decided the rest of their output over the subsequent 24 years was rubbish. This person saw Alien 3 and to this day thinks David Fincher can\u2019t direct. They once saw a production of Hamlet where the stage lights went out and they still tell all and sundry down the pub that Shakespeare was a hack. This person watched the Tracey Ullman show in 1987 and is still convinced The Simpsons won\u2019t be a hit.</p> <p><strong>This distant and far off land </strong>is a comments section somewhere. This person is an idiot. And this person still thinks Ben Stokes doesn\u2019t justify a place ahead of Nick Compton in the England Test team.</p> <p><strong>If any questions remained over Stokes before this Test </strong>he has put them to rest as firmly as a dastardly villain might do your favourite character in Game of Thrones. Were his first-innings figures of four for 26 not enough to satisfy Mr Below the Line then his masterful harnessing of reverse swing to claim three for eight \u2013 <em>three for bloody eight! </em>\u2013 and ensure that Bangladesh\u2019s tail damn well would not wag must have at least kept the troll quiet for the rest of the series. </p> <p><strong>Then, just to make sure,</strong> he came in with his side 48 for four and departed 85 runs later with England 242 runs ahead \u2013 extended to 273 by the close \u2013 and surely set to win this match. The only questions now are 1) whether it\u2019s still cool to love Ben Stokes, given everyone worth knowing surely does after that double rescue act, and 2) is there a better all-rounder in Test cricket now, if we consider Ravi Ashwin a pure bowler?</p> <p><strong>Bangladesh have a bit of a conundrum on their hands. </strong>They are in the curious situation whereby the sooner they bowl England out, the quicker they are likely to lose this one. Alastair Cook obviously won\u2019t declare overnight but any ball blocked by the last two wickets is a ball wasted on this pitch. I expect Tim de Lisle will be OBOing the <em>coup de grace</em> at some point in the second half of the day.</p> <p><strong>Play begins at 10am Chittagong time, </strong>which is a delightful 5AM BST AND I\u2019M IN THE SODDING OFFICE.

  "<p>The four months since the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/eu-referendum\">Brexit </a>vote have been something of a phoney war. Life for most has trundled on just as before. The shops have been full. Employment has continued to rise. Britain is still the low pay, low productivity country it always was. If someone had left in early June and returned today without access to the news, they would never know there had been a referendum.</p> <p>The release of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/economicgrowth\">growth </a>figures for the third quarter of 2016 on Thursday will reinforce the sense that not much has changed. </p> <p>In August, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/bankofenglandgovernor\">Bank of England </a>expected the economy to almost stall but it has had second thoughts in the light of more upbeat data. The consensus in the City is for growth of 0.3-0.4%, down on the second quarter but hardly a disaster.</p> <p>Yet Thursday marks the end of the phoney war. All the signs are that things are going to get a lot more interesting from now on.</p> <p>While the Bank has revised up its forecast of 0.1% growth in both the third and fourth quarters, it doesn\u2019t believe that the economy is out of the woods. It shares the view of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/04/britain-fastest-growing-g7-economy-imf-international-monetary-fund-brexit-vote\">International Monetary Fund </a>and the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/sep/21/oecd-does-a-u-turn-over-brexit-warning-as-it-revises-growth-forecast-for-britain\">Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development </a>that stronger growth now will come at the expense of slower growth later. Threadneedle Street\u2019s quarterly inflation report due out next month is unlikely to make pleasant reading. The Bank thinks inflation in 2017 will be higher than it predicted back in August and that output will be lower.</p> <p>As <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-10-05/may-says-unorthodox-monetary-policy-had-some-bad-side-effects\">Theresa May</a> reminded the nation in her Conservative party conference speech, the Bank has had monetary policy on an emergency setting for an awfully long time. Interest rates are already at 0.25% \u2013 the lowest they have ever been \u2013 and money creation under the quantitative easing programme has resumed.</p> <p>The Bank thinks the package of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/19/bank-of-england-rebuts-may-and-hagues-attacks-on-quantitative-easing\">measures it announced in August was necessary</a> to see the economy through the post-Brexit turbulence but not everybody agrees. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/18/william-hague-attacks-bank-of-england-over-ultra-low-interest-rates\">William Hague\u2019s claim last week that central banks have lost the plot</a> and need to start preparing the ground for higher borrowing costs was a clear shot across the Bank\u2019s bows.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/23/mark-carney-isnt-problem-austerity-bank-of-england-inequality\">Mark Carney isn\u2019t the problem. The problem was austerity</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In truth, the Bank would be delighted if it was in a position to return monetary policy to its pre-financial-crisis setting of interest rates of around 5% and no QE. Threadneedle Street is fully aware that ultra-loose policies are subject to the law of diminishing returns and that the risks increase the longer they are kept in place. But the monetary policy committee has noted that other central banks that have tried to tighten policy have been forced into rapid U-turns, so its decision next month will be whether to maintain the current level of stimulus or do more, with a cut in interest rates to 0.1% up for debate.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Three factors suggest the Bank will stick with the status quo: the better-than-expected performance of the economy post Brexit, the recent sharp fall in sterling which is seen as positive for output and hence the equivalent of a loosening of policy, and the need to keep some powder dry for if things get really sticky in 2017.</p> <p>Ideally, the Bank would like Philip Hammond to take on more of the burden for bolstering demand <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/08/philip-hammond-announces-autumn-budget-statement-for-23-november\">in his autumn statement next month</a>. Mark Carney has publicly said that it would be a good idea for macro-economic policy to be better balanced, with the Treasury taking the pressure off the Bank through higher public spending or lower taxes.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/03/philip-hammond-to-spend-his-way-out-of-brexit-fallout\">Hammond</a> has raised expectations about the autumn statement by talking about a reset of fiscal policy, and has already abandoned George Osborne\u2019s goal of achieving a budget surplus by the end of the parliament. That, though, doesn\u2019t mean he intends to throw caution to the winds.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>One of Osborne\u2019s aims when he announced the coalition government\u2019s austerity programme in 2010 was to give the Treasury scope to ease policy in the event of shocks such as Brexit. Behind all that stuff about mending roofs while the sun was shining was the idea of repairing the public finances in the good times so that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/21/uk-faces-14bn-shortfall-in-public-finances-warns-ifs\">there was money around in the bad times</a>.</p> <p>Unfortunately, Osborne\u2019s approach was a double disaster. Austerity did not lead to the balancing of the government\u2019s books but it did help to create the conditions for Brexit. <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/21/public-deficit-10-bn-corporation-tax-receipts-philip-hammond-shock-into-slugs\">Deficit reduction was much slower than forecast in the last parliament</a> and targets continue to be missed. In Osborne\u2019s last budget in March 2016, he pencilled in a \u00a320bn fall in borrowing to \u00a355bn in the current financial year, but six months in the deficit is only \u00a32bn lower than in the same period a year ago.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>In an ideal world, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/08/philip-hammond-announces-autumn-budget-statement-for-23-november\">Hammond </a>would<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/08/philip-hammond-announces-autumn-budget-statement-for-23-november\"> use the autumn statement</a> to boost public investment. Britain had the worst record for infrastructure spending of any G7 country in the 1980s and 1990s and is now paying the price. Similarly, only one G7 country devotes a smaller share of GDP to research and development than it did 30 years ago. No prizes for guessing which it is.</p> <p>Yet May has pledged that her government will look out for those who are only just managing. These are the people that are going to be hit by the freezing of tax credits and benefits at a time when inflation is rising. So Hammond is also under pressure to boost current spending. In all likelihood, he will try to do something for those on low incomes while also boosting capital spending. But the <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/07/philip-hammond-rules-out-splurge-in-public-spending-in-autumn-statement\">chancellor\u2019s warning that there will be no \u201csplurge\u201d in the autumn statement</a> reflects the fact that seven years after the trough of the last recession the budget deficit is still running at about 4% of GDP.</p> <p>The Brexit negotiations (or, more accurately, the lack of Brexit negotiations) further complicate matters. In one sense, the government\u2019s unwillingness to show its hand while at the same time adopting an uncompromising tone is understandable. Negotiations normally start with one side insisting on receiving 100% of what they want and the other side insisting that they will get nothing. After some haggling, an agreement is finally reached. The government has to threaten a hard Brexit in order to get as many concessions as possible.</p> <p>Yet there are some in the government \u2013 Hammond included \u2013 who think recent events show the limitations of this approach. They would say that fears of a hard Brexit that were inspired by speeches at the Conservative party conference have weakened the UK\u2019s negotiating stance by putting the wind up the financial markets. This has prompted a fall in the value of the pound, which will <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/18/inflation-rise-uk-living-standards\">lead to higher inflation and squeezed living standards in 2017</a>. This looks like being a testing year for May and her team.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p>",

Her granddaughter developed asthma while attending a school near the incinerator, but hasn\u2019t used an inhaler since she graduated and moved away.</p> <p>The persistent odor and emission of other polluting substances are among 40 alleged Clean Air Act and state violations that have been logged against the company that owns the facility, Detroit Renewable Energy, since March 2015, according to a notice to sue by the Great Lakes Environmental Law Center.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"72bc29f492666c57f9af3b12f952a282d1aa1c91\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/72bc29f492666c57f9af3b12f952a282d1aa1c91/0_126_1944_2430/800.jpg\" alt=\"Sandra Turner-Handy\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sandra Turner-Handy: \u2018You get this foul, rotten egg smell.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: courtesy of the Michigan Environmental Council</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cIt\u2019s the things that you can\u2019t smell that are the most harmful,\u201d said Turner-Handy. \u201cAnd how do residents report something that they can\u2019t smell?\u201d</p> <p>In 2015, the incinerator burned more than 650,000 tons of garbage, according to the notice. And since the beginning of that year, the incinerator has been fined for persistently violating an earlier agreement with the state for alleged state violations.</p> <p>The law center also said in the filing that the incinerator presents a clear example of an environmental justice problem, as a majority of the trash burnt at the facility is imported from outlying communities, which pay $10 a ton less than Detroit to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2016/jun/14/green-waste-distribution-methods-recycling-plastic-oil-epa\">dispose of garbage</a>.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2016/jun/14/green-waste-distribution-methods-recycling-plastic-oil-epa\">Can incineration and landfills save us from the recycling crisis?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cIn short, Detroit is subsidizing other communities throughout the State of Michigan, the Midwest, and Canada to dispose of its garbage at the Incinerator,\u201d the filing said, with the incinerator \u201clocated in a neighborhood that is composed mostly of low-income people of color and is heavily overburdened by air pollution\u201d.</p> <p>There\u2019s a long-running debate over whether incineration is better for the environment than landfills. But communities located near incinerators have long lamented that they bear the brunt of its adverse impacts on air quality.</p> <p>Citing statistics from the EPA, the center said 7,280 residents live within one mile of the incinerator, of whom 60% live below the federal poverty line and 87% are people of color. An EPA report also found that the area is a \u201chotspot for respiratory related health impacts when compared to other Michigan communities\u201d, according to the law center.</p> <p>The notice to sue also names Michigan\u2019s governor, Rick Snyder, along with the state and federal environment agencies. The agencies have 60 days to commence an enforcement action, the law center said, and if neither pursues any, a lawsuit may be filed on behalf of residents to enforce the Clean Air Act.</p> <p>Detroit Renewable Energy, which <a href=\"http://www.detroitrenewablepower.com/about/\">says</a> the facility provides energy to more than 140 buildings in the downtown and midtown neighborhoods, downplayed the litany of claims in the notice of intent.</p> <p>In a statement, the company said that it has invested approximately $6m over the last few years to \u201cimprove odor management\u201d at the facility. The company said it employs nearly 300 residents, operates a \u201csophisticated\u201d waste-to-energy facility, and \u201cplaces the highest priority on complying with the strict and complex requirements established by the EPA and the state environmental department.</p> <p>\u201cIn short, we have done our part,\u201d the company said. \u201cAny claim to the contrary would simply be false.\u201d</p> <p>The law center says otherwise.</p> <p>Beyond odor, the notice of intent to sue also highlights an additional 19 violations for emitting carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide, and particulate matter above legal thresholds. The incinerator creates a \u201csignificant amount\u201d of particulate matter, said Nick Schroeck, executive director of the center, which \u201ccan get lodged in people\u2019s lungs\u201d.</p> <p>The incinerator can\u2019t be directly linked to cases of asthma, but the filing said <br>\u201cparticulate matter emissions have been shown to trigger asthma incidents, particularly amongst children\u201d.</p> <p>Activists are pushing for a ballot initiative for November 2017 to close down the facility in favor of cleaner-energy-producing methods.</p> <p>\u201cWe initially approached this topic sort of by looking at what it was we could do that would be effective within the confines of city law, of state law, and how a ballot initiative could actually rectify a problem in the city,\u201d said Mac Farr, treasurer and spokesman for <a href=\"http://sustainabledetroit.co/\">Sustainable Detroit</a>. \u201cAnd we could take a policy change and use it to both unify the city and also make the lives of Detroiters better.

He suggested a more \u201crobust, citywide recycling program\u201d could \u201cdivert a lot of material out of the waste stream if we were to shut off incineration as a method of disposal\u201d.</p> <p>Officials estimated earlier this year that <a href=\"http://www.detroitnews.com/story/news/local/detroit-city/2016/02/11/detroit-recycling-outreach-campaign/80254664/\">only 11% of households</a> in the city are recycling.</p> <p>Dr Abdul El-Sayed, executive director and health officer at the Detroit health department, said issues surrounding the incinerator hadn\u2019t been on his department\u2019s radar until recently, but it\u2019s now \u201cvery squarely on my plate\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cI think it\u2019s obvious that when you burn anything, it\u2019s going to produce material that goes up into the air. That material can do a number of hazardous things,\u201d El-Sayed said. \u201cI think it\u2019s clear that those things are not good for the lungs, and the eyes and some of the other organs \u2026 the heart.

Others have the best clips pulled into the edit and then are erased, or destroyed.\u201d <br></p> <p>\u201cIt was nearly impossible to cut [another show] together between the grossness and abuse,\u201d she recalled of a show involving a prominent conservative politician.</p> <p>\u201cThat show was tape-destruction city, between [the two stars] and all of their other horrible, racist, homophobe, woman-abusing cronies,\u201d Janet said. \u201cIt was nearly impossible to cut that show together between the grossness and abuse. But we were contracted to make this guy appear like a hero and maintain the brand not only of the show, but him and the network.\u201d</p> <p>The producer said that few people spoke out about the treatment because it was made clear that their jobs were on the line: \u201cIf any of the stuff gets exposed, a network or production company can hunt that person down and destroy their career, if not sue them.\u201d</p> <p>Janet said she felt complicit in the culture of misogyny but that she also felt trapped by her paycheck. \u201cUltimately networks, producers and APs are to blame for creating these people, and are complicit in presenting these people in the way that makes the most money but aren\u2019t really their true character,\u201d she said. \u201cBut then you have to remember that if some little AP calls out a star on a sexist comment, it\u2019s not like the star of the show will be called out \u2013 the AP will just be fired and has no recourse. APs and producers just want to work and often witness this abuse and are subjected to this abuse on a daily basis with no protection. While being complicit, we also just needed jobs to pay our bills.\u201d<br></p> <h2><strong>\u2018</strong>It was such a personal thing\u2019</h2> <p>Mike Fleiss, producer of The Bachelor, said the responsibility to provide the public with material like the tapes of Donald Trump reportedly <a href=\"http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/apprentice-producers-footage-trump-n-word-report-article-1.2824047\">hurling racial slurs</a> and <a href=\"http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2016/10/13/donald-trump-called-deaf-apprentice-marlee-matlin-retarded.html\">making fun of Marlee Matlin, who is deaf</a>, on The Apprentice fell squarely on the shoulders of the person at the top of the corporate ladder.<br></p> <p>In this case, that is Mark Burnett, the outspokenly Christian producer of The Apprentice. He should give the public the tapes, Fleiss told the Guardian. \u201cIf he wanted to, he could release this footage,\u201d Fleiss said. \u201cIt\u2019s incredibly damning stuff and he owes it to people because it\u2019s the truth.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s so much footage,\u201d Fleiss said of reality TV. \u201cThese shows are triumphs of editing, mostly. On these shows it\u2019s a 50-to-one ratio, where you shoot 50 hours to make one hour.\u201d The tapes all go to a transcription service; the footage itself goes into a vault until the 20th anniversary special. Given Trump\u2019s behavior on Access Hollywood with Billy Bush, Fleiss told the Guardian, it was hard to imagine there was nothing else of deep public interest on the Apprentice tapes. \u201cHe was on the set of Access Hollywood for an hour,\u201d Fleiss pointed out. \u201cHe was there for 10 hours a day on the set of The Apprentice.\u201d</p> <p>Fleiss scoffs at the $5m fine for leaking material, which the billionaire <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeed.com/jessicasimeone/apprentice-legal-fees?utm_term=.okA82zBD8#.wtQo0GqVo\">Mark Cuban has offered to pay</a> anyone who is sued for releasing more footage of Trump. \u201cIt\u2019s very standard practice. Even the $5m number, in terms of penalties for breach of nondisclosure agreement, that\u2019s what\u2019s in The Bachelor contracts. Shoot, we have leaks all the time. People release information and we\u2019ve never sued anybody over it. If he wanted to, he could release this footage. It\u2019s incredibly damning stuff and he owes it to people because it\u2019s the truth.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/17/billy-bush-fired-nbc-donald-trump-tape-groping-women-leaked\">Billy Bush dropped by NBC after Trump tape about groping women leaked</a> </p> </aside>  <p>While ending the silence about harassment in TV is important to the general public in the case of the election, it\u2019s also important to the people who have been harassed. While Levit spoke of brushing off harassment, there are other ways the TV-world boys club hurt her. \u201cI hated LA,\u201d she recalled of one incident many years ago. \u201cThis was between \u201986 and \u201989. I didn\u2019t have a job, and I was looking for work. So I was networking as much as I could. Basically, I had gone to this guy\u2019s office, I don\u2019t even remember his name now, but he was a big muckety-muck at a television company or studio, and I guess he had called me saying, \u2018I got a letter from so-and-so and I\u2019d like you to come in and we can talk.\u2019\u201d </p> <p>\u201cI went in and he had the letter out on his desk, and he had to leave the office for a second. I mean \u2013 I can read upside down. And the letter said, \u2018I think you should meet Susan Levit. She comes with a lot of credentials, but she is not attractive at all.\u2019\u201d Levit pauses. \u201cI didn\u2019t know what to do with that. I didn\u2019t know if I should walk out or what. This was LA and this was the problem with LA, and if you weren\u2019t drop-dead gorgeous, you wouldn\u2019t exist.\u201d</p> <p>The nearly 30-year-old memory of the sudden intrusion of \u201clocker-room talk\u201d on the workplace still stings for Levit. \u201cI never saw myself as a Donald Trump kind of statuesque model beauty but, you know, I was OK! I wasn\u2019t fat! I was tall, I had a good sense of humor, I was cute,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was the kind of thing that was very hurtful, because it was such a personal thing that had nothing to do with work.\u201d</p> <p>After speaking to the Guardian, Levit followed up with an<strong> </strong>email: \u201cI don\u2019t care what you look like \u2013 none of this behavior should ever happen,\u201d she wrote, \u201cand pretty or not, that shouldn\u2019t be the deciding factor.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Is climate change still happening? You don\u2019t hear so much about it, do you? It\u2019s like the <em>Doctor Who</em> reboot \u2013 I presume it\u2019s still going on, but it\u2019s struggling to stay in the headlines. These days it\u2019s all <em>Bake Off</em>, Trump, Isis and <em>Poldark</em>.</p> <p>It must still be happening, because if it had stopped we would <em>definitely</em> have heard \u2013 you don\u2019t hear much about Sean Connery, but it\u2019ll be all over the news when he dies. A sudden halt in global warming would be an unmissable opportunity for climate change deniers to crow, for dark-souled petrol salesmen to denounce the scientific community as a bunch of delusional tree-huggers, for the scum of the earth to lay into the Friends of the Earth. So, I think it\u2019s safe to say climate change is still happening and the world\u2019s scientists aren\u2019t facing the spectre of being wrong instead of the more familiar spectre of being doomed. What a relief.</p> <p>As I understand it, then, the situation remains that human activities, particularly those that emit carbon dioxide, are elevating the planet\u2019s temperature in a way that, if unchecked, and maybe anyway, will render most of it uninhabitable by humans. That\u2019s still on the cards. Suddenly I\u2019m feeling a lot more relaxed about Brexit.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I'm not a very environmentally friendly person. I'd much rather turn a tree into a chair or a pizza box</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>But is it really, definitely happening? Well, again, as I understand it, the overwhelming scientific consensus is that it is. Manmade climate change is as certain as anything can be. Of course, there are people who say it isn\u2019t, who have fuelled much discussion (fuel is often their business), but then there are people who will deny the hands in front of their faces: there\u2019s a school of maverick historians that claims the years AD614 to AD911 never occurred; there are people who think Elvis or Hitler still live, or that they live with each other, or that they recently split up after a row about Jeremy Corbyn. There is no assertion, no matter how self-evident, that is completely safe from contradiction. If humans are to survive, it is imperative that \u201cIs climate change a myth?\u201d move from the same discussion category as \u201cShould we introduce proportional representation?\u201d to the same one as \u201cIs the Queen a lizard?\u201d</p> <p>What brought all these Christopher Eccleston-era reflections to mind was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/oct/19/theresa-may-accused-of-dither-and-delay-over-heathrow-airports-expansion\">Theresa May\u2019s announcement</a> last week about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/heathrow-airport\">Heathrow</a> airport \u2013 or rather her announcement last week that she\u2019s going to make an announcement next week. It\u2019s all incredibly involved and tedious: next week the government will finally say, after decades of dithering, whether Heathrow will get another runway, or a longer runway, or whether, instead, Gatwick will get another runway. But it isn\u2019t really finally, because under a \u201cspecial derogation\u201d, ministers who are pissed off with the choice (because, say, their constituencies are near Heathrow) will be allowed to openly moan about it and then it\u2019ll probably be 2018 before MPs vote on the issue, in order to allow lots of time for a public debate.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4c215a9044341f9ad2f8e80bb2247b24dc26f844\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4c215a9044341f9ad2f8e80bb2247b24dc26f844/0_0_1884_1675/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Illustration by David Foldvari of aeroplane wearing a gas mask.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"889\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Illustration by David Foldvari.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Illustration: David Foldvari</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It\u2019s the nature of this debate that frightens me.

For Labour, London mayor <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jul/15/london-mayor-sadiq-khan-gatwick-bosses-new-runway-heathrow\">Sadiq Khan opposes it</a> too and favours a new Gatwick runway. But all of this mainstream opposition seems to focus on the air and noise pollution (previously known as pollution and noise) it would cause in west London \u2013 hence the preference for the more rural Gatwick. Only the Greens and Lib Dems have even floated the notion of not extending an airport at all.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video element--supporting\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2016/oct/23/decision-airport-expansion-tuesday-chris-grayling-heathrow-gatwick-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/58z4q\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2832299\"            data-video-name=\"Decision on airport expansion to be made on Tuesday, says Grayling \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"BBC The Andrew Marr Show\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-580ca3b7e4b0d7abfb253e2d\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=11979170&amp;format=video/mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/10/23/161023GraylingMarr_WebM.webm\"/><source src=\"https://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=11979170&amp;format=video/m3u8\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2016/oct/23/decision-airport-expansion-tuesday-chris-grayling-heathrow-gatwick-video\">Decision on airport expansion to be made on Tuesday, says Grayling</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>This is bonkers. Climate change is definitely happening. Aviation contributes hugely to it. So global levels of aviation must be significantly reduced. Why is it, then, that everyone with a whisker of a chance of power agrees that London\u2019s airport capacity should increase? It\u2019s not one side saying \u201cLet\u2019s close an airport\u201d and the other saying \u201cLet\u2019s not\u201d \u2013 that would be a reasonable spread of opinion when the need to reduce air travel was accepted. Instead, it\u2019s both sides saying \u201cLet\u2019s hugely extend an airport\u201d. The only debate we\u2019re having is over which one.</p> <p>You may not believe this, but I am not a very environmentally friendly person. I would much rather turn a tree into a chair, a pizza box and a roaring fire than hug it. I don\u2019t much care about endangered species. For me, the environment, the delicate global ecosystem, is somewhere for humans to live. It\u2019s collectively ours and I think we can do what we like with it. But it\u2019s got to remain livable in and livable from. That\u2019s not leftwing, it\u2019s just obvious. And I can\u2019t believe all those scientists are lying, much as I would genuinely like to.</p> <p>In this crisis, we\u2019re suffering a potentially disastrous failure of leadership. Would Theresa May deny climate change? I doubt it. Would Sadiq Khan? No way. So why on earth, specifically on earth, do they want to extend an airport? For the sake of London\u2019s economy. Well, excuse the cliche, but you can\u2019t take it with you.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/18/climate-change-airport-expansion-heathrow\">Climate change means no airport expansion \u2013 at Heathrow or anywhere | George Monbiot</a> </p> </aside>  <p>I know I\u2019m ignoring the political realities and the importance of seeming pro-business, but isn\u2019t actual, physical reality a political reality too?

In which case, hey, build the runway. We might as well die prosperous. If we despair of reducing our environmental impact, if we\u2019re convinced the international agreements don\u2019t go far enough and won\u2019t be observed anyway, then let\u2019s extend away.

We will undoubtedly spend billions extending one airport or another but, on Britain\u2019s current form, that probably means global air travel actually will be reduced after all.

  "<p>As I enter the hotel suite, Tom Ford stands in silhouette against an industrial, ceiling-height window, the light refracted behind him in a sunburst. It\u2019s an irresistible image, so perfect it almost had to be composed: both man and room shown off to their optimal effect. And, who am I kidding, it probably was. I had been checked at the door for a minute or two while Ford had rearranged some furniture that was irking him. Even a rented room, used for a day to plug a new movie, can be improved. Ford is obsessed with beautiful things and has had an enduring and hugely successful career, first in fashion, now as a film director, making people and places look their best.</p> <p>Ford strides towards me, eager, like a politician on the election trail, and extends his hand. I had read that he prefers to be called \u201cMr Ford\u201d and check if that\u2019s the case. \u201cNo, no, no,\u201d he smiles, as if it was one of the top five most ridiculous things he\u2019s ever heard. \u201cPleeease call me Tom.\u201d</p> <p>Tom Ford, the man, has always been the most compelling advertisement for Tom Ford, the creative output. He is, it\u2019s almost inane to note, a very handsome individual. These are looks that many would sell their souls for, but Ford, now an impossible 55 years old, hasn\u2019t needed to: just lots of vegetables and fish, no booze for years, tennis three times a week and an occasional restrained touch-up with Botox under the eyes and Just for Men dye on his beard stubble.</p> <p>Today, as he almost always does, Ford wears a cinched black suit, matching tie, a gold collar bar. \u201cA suit is armour,\u201d he explains. \u201cYou know, I\u2019m not good in knitwear.\u201d His voice, almost a growl, is saturated with disdain. \u201cI feel mushy and soft. I\u2019m not good in anything but a boot. I feel solid and grounded. You gotta learn in life what makes you feel comfortable in terms of clothing and that\u2019s what you should wear. Some people look great in knitwear; that\u2019s what they want to wear, they look good in it, it feels right for them. Trainers: I feel weak in trainers. I mean, I wear them when I\u2019m at the gym, but I feel soft and I don\u2019t like that.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I actually had people say to me, \u2018My God, I didn\u2019t realise you had such depth.\u2019 It\u2019s kind of shocking</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>How about when he was shooting his new film, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/nocturnal-animals\"><em>Nocturnal Animals</em></a>, did Ford wear a suit then? \u201cYes, I wore it on set, it\u2019s a uniform. I\u2019m comfortable, it suits who I am,\u201d he replies. \u201cExcept the parts when we were in Texas, where I wore cowboy boots and a cowboy hat, which looks surprisingly good on me. Well, all of a sudden, 200 years of Texas pioneer background kind of genetically seems to just work on my head. And I don\u2019t look like a fool.\u201d</p> <p>Ford \u2013 I hope this is coming across \u2013 is surprisingly funny. He is completely serious and at the same time, nullifying the criticism often levelled at those in the fashion world, completely aware that some people will find what he\u2019s saying ridiculous. There are numerous stories-cum-urban-legends that have attached themselves to Ford over the years. That he takes five baths a day. That he doesn\u2019t like to see or smell food in his office. That he once sent an employee home for wearing three-quarter-length trousers. That he cannot abide hot drinks. That \u2013 this one courtesy of Victoria Beckham \u2013 he flies long haul in his suit and his only concession is to undo a single waistcoat button.</p> <p>Some people would regard him as eccentric, I say. \u201cEccentric?\u201d says Ford, visibly perking up, his hands carving arcs, like a matador\u2019s. \u201cOh, tell me about that!\u201d</p> <p>The multiple baths in a day. \u201cOh, I can explain that,\u201d he counters, a little disappointed perhaps that the rumour was not more outrageous. \u201cFor me, it\u2019s meditation. I take a bath in the morning, because the time I lie in the bathtub is when I work out all my problems. I think about the day, I think about what I\u2019ve got to do. I think about nothing, I clear my head. Same in the evening, before dinner, I can\u2019t go from work and out to a dinner and be good at a dinner \u2013 meaning be interesting and charming and be interested and listen to someone \u2013 unless I kind of wash away the day. The same at night, I can\u2019t go to sleep unless I get in the bathtub and again, wash away the day. So it\u2019s meditative for me, it\u2019s not that I have some cleanliness obsession.\u201d</p> <p>So that\u2019s cleared that up. \u201cI don\u2019t smoke,\u201d he goes on. \u201cSome people go out and have a cigarette. I don\u2019t drink, some people drink.\u201d He exhales theatrically. \u201cI lie in a bath full of hot water.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"6553595738ebf7b1e3a6e5379442f2d1ffda0239\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6553595738ebf7b1e3a6e5379442f2d1ffda0239/0_384_3926_2355/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tom Ford directs Amy Adams in Nocturnal Animals.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018That very hard, lacquered, manufactured, glamorous life is part of the story\u2019: Tom Ford directs Amy Adams in the opening scenes of Nocturnal Animals.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Merrick Morton</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It is common, as shown here, to fixate on Ford\u2019s aesthetic. This is, after all, how he made his name: he arrived, unheralded, as a designer at Gucci in 1990, when the company was on its knees; when he departed in 2004, it was one of the world\u2019s most desired luxury brands, owning Yves Saint Laurent, Alexander McQueen and Stella McCartney, and valued at $10bn. In 2006, he started trading under his own name and there are now 122 Tom Ford stores, which take around $1bn each year in sales. Daniel Craig insists on Tom Ford suits for the Bond films, while Michelle Obama chose one of his gowns when she met the Queen.</p> <p>The idea, though, that he might be stronger on style than substance endured when Ford moved into film. His first feature, in 2010, was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/feb/14/a-single-man-film-review\"><em>A Single Man</em></a>, which followed a day in the life of a college professor, masterfully played by Colin Firth, who is contemplating suicide. It was a deeply assured debut and one that Ford was involved in every aspect of: as a writer \u2013 adapting <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/apr/20/100-best-novels-a-single-man-christopher-isherwood\">Christopher Isherwood\u2019s 1964 novel</a> \u2013 director and producer, plunging in some of his own savings, not all of which were returned at the box office. Still, many reviewers struggled to see past the lush cinematography and Firth\u2019s instantly iconic thick-rimmed spectacles. Peter Bradshaw in the <em>Guardian</em> wrote that it sometimes resembled <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/feb/11/a-single-man-review\">\u201ca 100-minute commercial for men\u2019s cologne: Bereavement by Dior\u201d</a>.</p> <p>Ford believes, with some justification, that there is a perception of him as an individual that precedes his films. \u201cI\u2019m a very, very, very private person,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m also a very shy person. So what most people know of me is a product. It is a billboard. It is a selling tool. That\u2019s not to say it\u2019s false. It comes from me. Everything I make I am proud of. So this is a part of my personality, but it\u2019s the surface. When I made <em>A Single Man</em>, I actually had people say to me, \u2018My God, I didn\u2019t realise you had such depth.\u2019 It\u2019s kind of shocking. You realise, \u2018Oh, oh-kay\u2026\u2019\u201d</p> <p>His point is that the real Ford is more than the guy with perma-stubble who happens to look fantastic in aviators. \u201cI\u2019m glad that there is a large part of my character and my personality that is private,\u201d he says. \u201cYou know, I don\u2019t have a personal Instagram account, I\u2019m not photographing my dinner every night and sending it out to the world. I\u2019m quite private and the older I get the more I guard that, and the more famous I\u2019ve become, the more and more and more I guard that.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s not just reviewers, either. When Ford approached Jake Gyllenhaal to star in <em>Nocturnal Animals</em>, the actor has admitted that he was concerned Ford, whom he didn\u2019t know at this point, would <a href=\"http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/features/tom-ford-designer-turned-director-925601\">\u201cfocus on the aesthetic over the heart of the story\u201d</a>. Gyllenhaal, however, was quickly convinced after speaking to the director, as was Amy Adams, who signed on to play the female lead, Susan, a privileged but unhappy gallery owner.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>My son is going to grow up in a very privileged world, and I want to make sure that he\u2019s grounded</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cI have to say, luckily most of the reviews of <em>Nocturnal Animals</em> have been terrific,\u201d notes Ford. \u201cBut the very few criticisms have been that\u2019s it\u2019s too beautiful, too stylised. I think if I didn\u2019t have another life as a fashion designer I wouldn\u2019t be hearing that and people wouldn\u2019t be judging that.</p> <p>\u201cNot comparing myself to Hitchcock,\u201d he continues, \u201cbut I\u2019ll use him as an example. He was notorious for spending weeks on his leading ladies\u2019 hair, makeup, look, clothes. What most directors do is intentional: how they frame something, whether it\u2019s composed or not composed is part of telling the story. In this particular case, that very hard, lacquered, manufactured, glamorous life is part of the story. It\u2019s key to understanding who Susan is and how she lives. It isn\u2019t just random because I wanted to see some beautiful clothes and beautiful hair and beautiful makeup. This is part of the story.\u201d</p> <p>That story is something of a departure for Ford, as well. <em>Nocturnal Animals </em> \u2013 a Grand Jury prize winner at Venice \u2013 which is adapted, again by Ford, from a 1993 novel called <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/jul/17/tony-and-susan-austin-wright\"><em>Tony and Susan</em></a> by Austin Wright, begins as very much a companion piece to <em>A Single Man</em>. Susan lives in a striking modernist house straight from the pages of <em>Wallpaper*</em>; her husband, Hutton (Armie Hammer), seems to smell of money, but they clearly don\u2019t much like each other. Susan has even inherited Colin Firth\u2019s signature glasses.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bc1109f1912a8de1a3f8c8d23833f756168b9b95\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bc1109f1912a8de1a3f8c8d23833f756168b9b95/717_21_1958_1176/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Colin Firth in Tom Ford\u2019s acclaimed directorial debut, A Single Man (2009), based on the novel of the same name by Christopher Isherwood.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Colin Firth in Tom Ford\u2019s acclaimed directorial debut, A Single Man (2009), based on the novel of the same name by Christopher Isherwood.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Everett/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Everything changes, though, when Susan receives a package from her first husband, Edward (Gyllenhaal), whom she hasn\u2019t seen in years: it\u2019s a novel he\u2019s written, dedicated to her; a brutal page-turner about a family travelling across the Texas desert who find themselves in an altercation with a gang of young droogs. <em>Nocturnal Animals</em> now starts flicking between Susan\u2019s sedate, joyless life in Los Angeles and a pulse-racing crime thriller that plays out in her head as she reads Edward\u2019s book. Ford ultimately intertwines these stories into one suffocatingly intense narrative and makes powerful, sometimes stinging comments on the importance of loyalty, the thrill of revenge and the perils of consumerism.</p> <p>Yes, you read that straight: Tom Ford is railing against the perils of consumerism. A man whose eponymous fashion label sells an oversize Dakota bag for $6,450 (\u00a35,250) and whose suits for men all cost in excess of $5,000 (\u00a34,100). A man who owns a house in Bel Air designed by Richard Neutra, an 1827 John Nash Mayfair townhouse and a ranch in New Mexico, on land larger than Manhattan, with Tadao Ando buildings and an airstrip, which was recently put on the market for \u00a360m. But Ford is no fool and well aware of the extreme potential for hypocrisy.</p> <p>\u201cThe character of Susan is quite autobiographical; in some ways, she was a female version of me,\u201d Ford admits. \u201cFortunate or not, I live in that world that Susan lives in. I know those people. A few years ago now, I really had a midlife crisis. I think a lot of my younger years \u2013 and a lot of people\u2019s younger years, I bet \u2013 are spent achieving whatever it is, when you\u2019re young, you think you need to do. Getting ahead in your career, getting this, getting that, buying your first apartment, getting married and then you realise, \u2018OK, well I\u2019ve done all that, now what? Is this what there is?\u2019\u201d</p> <p>A low point came when he acrimoniously left Gucci: his drinking got out of control, he became depressed. \u201cA lot of people keep it in check. I didn\u2019t. That doesn\u2019t mean you want to give up those material things, but it means you need to keep a balance and so yeah, I\u2019ve struggled with that. And I\u2019ve struggled with contemporary culture. Sometimes, contemporary culture revolts me. And where we\u2019re moving, it just disgusts me.\u201d</p> <p>Ford shakes his head. He\u2019s aware he\u2019s asking questions and not supplying too many answers. \u201cWe\u2019re culturally taught now that there\u2019s this thing called happiness that\u2019s achievable,\u201d he sighs. Where we\u2019re just happy because we\u2019ve done this and that, we\u2019ve gotten there, we\u2019ve bought this house and we\u2019ve got these kids and we\u2019re just happy now. That\u2019s a relatively new idea. Because happiness doesn\u2019t exist. A happy morning exists and then maybe a depressing lunch and a bad afternoon and maybe a nice evening. We\u2019re sold this concept and I realise that I\u2019m one of the people that\u2019s helping do this because I\u2019m responsible also for our contemporary consumer culture.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3a47b25361ca78b8590da8319fe939966cb5eff2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3a47b25361ca78b8590da8319fe939966cb5eff2/0_0_3209_4012/800.jpg\" alt=\"Tom Ford on the set of Nocturnal Animals.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tom Ford on the set of Nocturnal Animals.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Merrick Morton</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Ford grew up middle class in middle America, first in Texas, then New Mexico from the age of 11; his parents were real-estate agents. From as early as he can remember, Ford had a singular fascination with style. He often chose to wear a suit as a child and was mercilessly bullied at school for carrying a briefcase. \u201cActually, it was an attache case,\u201d he corrects. \u201cBut that\u2019s true, they were really mean to me. I look back at pictures of myself in a little raincoat and briefcase and I just think, \u2018Oh God\u2026\u2019 But that was me and my parents just let me express who I was, which was also great.\u201d</p> <p>Again you get the impression, though he might deny it, that Ford has never been bothered by being regarded as eccentric. \u201cI have a sister, she didn\u2019t dress like that at all,\u201d he says. \u201cShe\u2019s not remotely interested in fashion, she\u2019s an English teacher. She could have all the Tom Ford clothes she wants; she doesn\u2019t care. She\u2019s quite beautiful but she\u2019s never been into fashion. My mother is, however, and my grandmother was to the nth degree. So I had women around me who were. I don\u2019t think I ever saw my mother without her makeup as a child. Ever. But that\u2019s a very Texas thing. My first scent memories were hairspray \u2013 it was the early 1960s, I was sitting on the floor playing while she was getting dressed.\u201d</p> <p>Ford has been reflecting on his early years more since he\u2019s become a parent himself. Jack was born four years ago, reportedly by in-vitro fertilisation and a surrogate, to Ford and Richard Buckley, a fashion writer and his partner of 30 years. \u201cHe\u2019s going to grow up in a very privileged world and I want to make sure that he\u2019s grounded,\u201d says Ford, who, after 25 years living in Europe, mainly London, recently moved his primary residence to Los Angeles (\u201cAll of a sudden I needed some sun. I did!\u201d). \u201cSo a big consideration is to try to raise him in a very natural, non-elitist way.\u201d</p> <p>Jack\u2019s arrival, Ford believes, has made him perhaps a fraction less uptight; he\u2019d hoped that Jack would play with tasteful, grey wooden toys, but his stark, beautiful houses are now defiled by lurid plastic. \u201cAt the end of the day, he always tells me about his day and I tell him about my day and Richard talks about his day,\u201d says Ford. \u201cThe other night, Jack says, \u2018Well, how was your day? You look sad.\u2019 And I said, \u2018Well, it was a tough day.\u2019 Then he said, \u2018You know, you say that every night.\u2019 And I said, \u2018I do?\u2019 And he said, \u2018Yeah. So what are you going to do about that?\u2019</p> <p>\u201cAnd I thought, \u2018Wow, what am I going to do about that?\u2019 Their observations are so simple and so clear: \u2018Well, you\u2019re sad, you need to do something about that.\u2019 It\u2019s very interesting. Then I felt guilty and terrible: \u2018Oh God, I\u2019m going home every day and seeming sad and I should be really there for him.\u2019 But you know, just the daily stresses of businesses sometimes get to you.\u201d</p> <p>Films make Ford happy, he insists, but he still retains a stubborn streak of melancholy. \u201cWorking, for me, keeps me distracted and keeps me from pondering the ultimate end to all of this, which is the same for all of us,\u201d he says. \u201cWe have to let go of it all, we have to say goodbye to everything. That doesn\u2019t terrify me, but I\u2019m aware of it every second. And I think it\u2019s one of the things that makes me appreciate things, because you realise this isn\u2019t going to last, so I need to look at it, I need to experience it, I need to try to drink it in. Beauty I find so sad. There\u2019s nothing sadder to me than true, true beauty because it is so temporary and so transient, so somehow you\u2019ve got to embrace that aspect of it.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d he concludes, \u201cI sound like a crazy person. I guess I\u2019m quite philosophical and I spend an enormous amount of time pondering all of these things \u2013 in the bath. In the bath!\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bddb3e01b6acec1d94093270526331a8ec0267ec\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bddb3e01b6acec1d94093270526331a8ec0267ec/0_0_4163_2499/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ford walks the runway during his London fashion week show at Lindley Hall, February 2014.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ford walks the runway during his London fashion week show at Lindley Hall, February 2014.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Samir Hussein/WireImage</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Seeing as much of modern culture, as he says, \u201cdisgusts\u201d him, does Ford ever worry about the world that Jack will grow up in? \u201cI think every generation feels that,\u201d he replies. \u201cYou go back and read something 100 years old and that\u2019s what adults are talking about. For them, it will be their world. And some day Kim Kardashian is probably going to be on some stage at Kennedy Center Honors [annual awards given to a handful of artists judged to have made a meaningful contribution to American culture] when she\u2019s 80, getting an award.\u201d Ford claps, perhaps sarcastically. \u201cAnd everyone\u2019s going to say, \u2018Oh my God, Kim Kardashian, don\u2019t you remember when she was\u2026\u2019\u201d She will be their Marilyn. She will be there because this is the world we live in.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s been seven years since <em>A Single Man</em>, but Ford has been keeping busy. He wanted to devote proper time to raising his son. Meanwhile, the fashion juggernaut rolls on, requiring a new collection for men and women twice a year. There were false starts, too, before he settled on <em>Nocturnal Animals</em> as the script to pursue. \u201cThere\u2019s been work. Thought. And things I turned down.\u201d He laughs. \u201cAnd two screenplays I wrote that are not so good and I wouldn\u2019t make.\u201d</p> <p>Ford continues to love clothes and he\u2019s proud of the enduring popularity of Tom Ford, but it\u2019s hard not to feel that he has little left to prove in that world. He pretty well admits as much. \u201cThere\u2019s a moment in fashion when you think of the idea,\u201d he says. \u201cYou think, \u2018Oh God, fuck, that\u2019s it!\u2019 And a lot of times you\u2019re wrong and it doesn\u2019t work at all, but that moment when you think it does is great. But fashion is very fleeting. You can look at that same thing the next year and you\u2019re like, \u2018OK, yeah that\u2019s nice.\u2019 And you look at it years later in a museum and you go, \u2018Well, that\u2019s interesting, look at how I did that stitching, that was great.\u2019 But it never has the power that it does at the very beginning.</p> <p>\u201cAnd film does,\u201d he continues. \u201cYou watch an old film, everyone\u2019s dead but you\u2019re crying with them, you\u2019re emoting with them; it\u2019s the most rewarding thing if you\u2019re someone who wants to express themselves. It\u2019s the most permanent thing I think that we have. Even painting. Let\u2019s take abstract expressionism. The very first time people saw an abstract painting it would have been shocking. Today, it\u2019s modern vocabulary, we see it everywhere, it can\u2019t have the [same] power. Film doesn\u2019t do that. Film, if it\u2019s not something that\u2019s easily dated, if it\u2019s genuine, has the same power when you watch it 30 years, 40 years, 80 years later. It\u2019s not diluted. And that\u2019s incredible.\u201d</p> <p>There\u2019s a stubborn sniffiness about a fashion designer making films, but the process is remarkably similar, Ford has found. Both require a strong vision, something to say and the ability to command an army of hired hands, working them hard without demoralising them, inspiring them to bring to life what you have in your head. Both activities also suit an obsessive, single-minded temperament. It\u2019s easy to mock the idea of Ford luxuriating in three baths a day, but he wakes at 4.30am, barely sleeps and can subsist for days on just iced coffee and Oreo Thins.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2450213a01e622115bae3d89723e634f4124f9f3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2450213a01e622115bae3d89723e634f4124f9f3/0_0_3285_1971/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jake Gyllenhaal as Tony Hastings in Nocturnal Animals.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jake Gyllenhaal as Tony Hastings in Nocturnal Animals.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/Universal Pictures</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Ford has also brought a mastery of the eye-catching stunt to both fields, often involving nudity. One advertisement for Gucci, shot by Mario Testino, featuring a female model pulling down her pants to show a G shaved in her pubic hair. Sophie Dahl sprawled libidinously on a silk sheet for Opium by Yves Saint Laurent, meanwhile, found its way on to the Advertising Standards Agency\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-18243577\">\u201cTop 10 Most Complained About Ads\u201d</a> list. Ford, though, has always considered himself <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2015/mar/21/tom-ford-im-an-equal-opportunity-objectifier\">\u201can equal-opportunity objectifier\u201d</a> and in 2002 he showed a male martial artist full frontal in an ad for YSL\u2019s M7 fragrance.</p> <p>The opening scenes of <em>Nocturnal Animals</em> have been causing a similar fuss at film festivals. It depicts a montage of full-figured, not-young women dancing naked in slow motion. They are accessorised with bits and pieces of Americana while glitter tumbles around them. Eventually, the viewer clicks that it is in fact a video art piece that is being projected in Susan\u2019s gallery. So Tom Ford, what were you\u2026</p> <p>\u201cWhat were you thinking?\u201d he interjects. \u201cWhat the hell was that?\u201d</p> <p>Exactly. \u201cWhen I was young I had a poster of Farrah Fawcett in a red bikini, which I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve seen, with the big teeth and hair, and I think that was a lot of people\u2019s idea of America: the land of tans, beauty and youth,\u201d Ford explains. \u201cAnd I decided that today, perhaps, to the outside world America looks gluttonous, overfed, ageing, sagging, decrepit. So I shot that and I had the most fun day making that. These women were so happy to be there, they were so free, they were just liberated, they were spectacular. I fell in love with them. And I realised that actually they were the opposite of Susan: they were joyful because they had let go of what they were supposed to be and they were just themselves. Whether you like them or hate them and think they are fat or not fat, they were themselves. And they were comfortable with that. So that became the opening art sequence.\u201d</p> <p>Ford has clearly thought about his defence, marshalled his arguments, but he can\u2019t help a mischievous aside. \u201cFrom a practical standpoint and a theatrical standpoint, it also pulls you right into the film from the beginning,\u201d he says. \u201cGets your attention and that\u2019s important. And then you\u2019re like, \u2018Where\u2019s this going?\u2019 And you\u2019re watching.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5n750DzGzG0\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/5n750DzGzG0?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5n750DzGzG0\">Watch the trailer for Nocturnal Animals.</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p><em>Nocturnal Animals</em> is likely to surprise many people: it is smarter, more visceral, more thought-provoking than doubters would have expected from Tom Ford, while still being just as beguiling to look at. He draws compelling, award-worthy performances from Amy Adams, Jake Gyllenhaal and Michael Shannon, as a nihilistic Texas policeman charged with tracking down the thugs. It is a terrific film that stirs and aggressively challenges the head, eyes and heart.</p> <p>Ford vows that it won\u2019t be seven years before he has a new movie project; he\u2019ll never be prolific, partly because he wants to be involved in every stage of the process, but three years is more like it. What about children, would he like more? \u201cOriginally, I thought yes; however now I think no,\u201d he says. \u201cI love Jack, we\u2019re a great family, we\u2019re very happy, the three of us. I\u2019m not a young dad, Richard\u2019s an even older dad. If I pick Jack up out of the bathtub and he wiggles the wrong way, it throws my back out. I think there\u2019s a reason why people have children when they\u2019re in their 20s and 30s! So no, we\u2019re really happy as a family as we are.\u201d</p> <p>This is perhaps the most shocking moment of the interview: Ford, a man who seems personally to defy the progress of time, acknowledges that he is getting older. As we wrap up our conversation, I ask him if he\u2019s just a bit terrified about ageing. \u201cI think it\u2019s time I started ageing, otherwise I\u2019ll start looking odd,\u201d he says. \u201cYou have to give in to it. I mind the physical part that comes with it, but the actual mindset that comes with it, I love. Because while I don\u2019t like it, I also don\u2019t care as much. So what? This is who I am.\u201d</p> <p>What about letting himself go grey? He looks at me sternly, then a little hurt. \u201cWhat makes you think I\u2019m grey?!\u201d Then his voice rumbles like a muscle car revving its engine: \u201cOh no, I\u2019ve planned on going grey. I know exactly when I\u2019ll go grey. I have a four\u2011year-old child, there\u2019s lots of time to go grey. I plan on living into my 90s, so maybe 72, 73, 74, I\u2019ll go grey. Then I\u2019ll have a good 20 years of grey.\u201d A stickler for good manners, he walks me to the door of the suite. \u201cThat\u2019s plenty.\u201d</p> <p><em>Nocturnal Animals is out on 4 November</em></p>",
  "<p>When I first heard that there was a new app, \u201c<a href=\"https://vina.io/\">Hey! Vina</a>\u201d, for women looking to make friends with other women, I had one reaction: it must be full of sad, desperate losers. I know, I\u2019m the pathetic one: a grown woman talking like an insecure teenager about total strangers trying to have a nice time. Turns out a lot of people disagree with me. When the app launched in America, 110,000 users signed up to it in the first six months. It was so successful that the app has now launched worldwide. Tinder has even invested in it.</p> <p>But the forging of friendships is such an important part of childhood, I started to wonder if my attitudes and fears around it were forever stuck there, too. You can\u2019t use an app to make friends, my negative voices all hissed, you should just be able to find them in the real world, even though this is how people reacted to online dating years ago and it\u2019s now so common that half the weddings I go to are of couples who met on a profile page. (I even went to one where the groom had printed all the wedding stationery in the <em>Guardian</em> typeface, to honour their having met on <a href=\"https://soulmates.theguardian.com/\"><em>Guardian</em> Soulmates</a>.)</p> <p>But however many \u201creal life\u201d friends you may have had at one point, life does change. Relationships break up, people move away, sometimes friendship groups implode. According to Facebook, I have hundreds of lovely friends, but most of them are faces on a scrolling screen only. In real life, I often think things like, \u201cI could go to the cinema tonight, who should I text?\u201d \u2013 and end up texting nobody.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I have hundreds of lovely friends, but most are just faces on a\u00a0scrolling screen</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>So when I downloaded the app, I was relieved to find that the people on Hey! Vina seemed perfectly normal, or even a bit more interesting than that. Quite a few were women who\u2019d recently moved to the UK from another country to study \u2013 from Holland, South Africa, Portugal. There was a British girl who loved galleries and wanted to find someone else who would wander round with her, staring at art. A trans woman who had only recently started living as one and wanted new friends for her new life. I realised this might be the perfect place for me to say that I really enjoy Iranian cinema \u2013 something I once mentioned on a dating website, leading to a painfully laborious conversation with a man who probably knew as little about it as I did. It\u2019s not that it\u2019s my specialist subject, I\u2019d just like to go and see some. Perhaps, through this friendship app, I might actually get round to it.</p> <p>So I do IT. I hit the button that lifts details from my Facebook page so I don\u2019t have to fill in any forms, and can just get started. I start scrolling, and pressing the \u201cHey!\u201d button on women who look nice. After a while I grow disheartened, as nobody is liking me back. I check back the next day and still nobody wants to be my friend. It turns out it is me who is the sad, desperate loser. So this is how karma feels. Why won\u2019t they notice me? I am almost distraught \u2013 until I bother to actually look at my own profile and realise it has taken the photo from my Facebook page: a 1980s paparazzi shot of Princess Diana and Fergie, on a ski lift. Which, personally, is a female friendship I\u2019d be more than happy to emulate, but people on here clearly want to see your real face.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"57d7a04907f0eb34b41e321e7edadbaeb9181c6d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/57d7a04907f0eb34b41e321e7edadbaeb9181c6d/0_0_882_1671/528.jpg\" alt=\"An illustration of two girls, their arms around each other, looking and smiling at a phone\" width=\"528\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Am I suddenly about to realise I\u2019m actually a lesbian?\u2019: the Hey Vina! app has now been launched worldwide.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Illustration: Andrew Rae</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I change the picture and quite soon am befriended back by Ana, a Portuguese 28-year-old who is in London for a couple of years to perfect her English.

We do have a nice time, though \u2013 I find out all about her MA in marketing; she finds out about my theories on new money, old money, and why that scruffy guy over there probably went to Eton.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>With friend dating, you are waiting to see if you click, but the end goal is not an after-dark frisson</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>In my head, I am comparing the experience to online dating, in which there is always an end goal, a question of is this going somewhere, are they into me, am I into them? There is always a potential unveiling: of skin and of intent. With friend dating, you are also waiting to see if you click, but the end goal is not commitment or an after-dark frisson. It\u2019s to organise another trip to the caf\u00e9, which Ana and I promise to do soon \u2013 then she has to leave. I stay in the caf\u00e9 a bit longer, realising I have thoroughly enjoyed myself. But was it friendship, or something more performative? I\u2019m not sure yet.</p> <p>The same week, I see my old friend Melissa, who moved to New York to manage a bar, but is in London on a flying visit. Her job is inherently sociable, you would think, but when I ask how life there is going, she says: \u201cI\u2019ve not really found my people.\u201d She does have friends, but says they don\u2019t quite feel like her tribe. \u201cI have a type,\u201d she adds, \u201cI\u2019ve been analysing it and I\u2019ve realised that the problem is I\u2019m not meeting my kind of women. I have a definite type.\u201d</p> <p>That\u2019s it, I think \u2013 it really is the same as romantic dating. We do have types. So perhaps, rather than accepting the friends we find at work, we should identify the qualities we want in one, and then look for them on an app. So I tell Melissa about it, and about the friend date I went on. She looks slightly horrified, so I show her it. \u201cWait,\u201d she says, scrolling through the profiles on my phone, \u201cThese people actually seem\u2026 all right?\u201d</p> <p>Before I can stop her, she\u2019s clicked through to look at my own profile. I am embarrassed. \u201cSince when,\u201d she asks, almost laughing, \u201cwere you interested in Iranian cinema?\u201d And I think to myself that the other me, the one who describes herself to total strangers on the internet, has been interested in it for a very long time, actually.</p>",

The third-class coach with its hard wooden seats made its laborious way across a Germany struggling for survival in the first world war. A chalk line drawn across the floor of the carriage separated the Russians from their German military minders, for the two countries were at war and Lenin\u2019s sealed train represented a desperate last throw of the dice by the Kaiser\u2019s government in Berlin.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2016/oct/02/in-lenin-foosteps-journey-railway-haparanda-sweden-finland\">In Lenin\u2019s footsteps: a journey to Haparanda, Sweden</a> </p> </aside>  <p>They were gambling that by smuggling Lenin into revolutionary St Petersburg, the Bolshevik leader\u2019s charismatic presence would cause enough chaos to knock Russia out of the war. This, in turn, would allow the Germans to concentrate their forces on defeating the British and French on the western front before the mighty US \u2013 which entered the war that same month \u2013 could hand victory to the allies.</p> <p>The German gamble succeeded beyond their wildest dreams \u2013 turning, in fact, into a nightmare for them and the rest of the capitalist powers. For Lenin, in Churchill\u2019s phrase the \u201cplague bacillus\u201d inserted so clumsily into Russia\u2019s fluid body politic, succeeded by sheer force of persuasion and his own implacable will in convincing his more cautious comrades that their disciplined and organised Bolshevik party could seize power themselves. That October they tore it from the fumbling hands of the post-revolutionary provisional government and created the world\u2019s first communist state.</p> <p>Catherine Merridale, an experienced and enthusiastic historian of Russia, has chosen the pivotal moment of Lenin\u2019s slow and halting odyssey to hang her history of how this ruthless fanatic hijacked a revolution and refashioned it in his own cruel and grim image.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9cb16a0c695947bb0089fc612b8e7dc132b38ce0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9cb16a0c695947bb0089fc612b8e7dc132b38ce0/0_173_5184_3110/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Lenin banners at a Moscow march for International Workers\u2019 Day last May.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lenin banners are displayed at a march through Moscow for International Workers\u2019 Day last May.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mikhail Japaridze/TASS</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>With a novelist\u2019s readability and a fertile imagination \u2013 she even tells us what Lenin was looking at as he gazed out of the train\u2019s windows \u2013 Merridale retraces his week-long journey from Germany, via Sweden and Finland, to the Russia he had not seen for nearly 20 years. At the same time, she skilfully weaves into the story the unfolding revolution in St Petersburg and the background to Lenin\u2019s long exile, especially the vicious ideological feuds between his \u201cextremist\u201d Bolsheviks and the \u201cmoderate\u201d Mensheviks.</p> <p>When the February revolution broke out in Russia, Lenin found himself stranded in sleepy, neutral Switzerland. The only way home was through Germany, and so the exiled and agonisingly frustrated Bolshevik leader, acting through a slimy intermediary aptly named Helphand, negotiated the deal to get himself and his disciples shipped back to Russia. His enemies used his collaboration with the enemy to discredit him as a traitor, and Merridale spends several pages proving that the puritanical Lenin did not actually receive German gold himself, as alleged \u2013 before rather spoiling her argument by admitting that he would have taken roubles from the devil himself in order to achieve his revolutionary aims.</p> <p>While dutifully and briefly acknowledging that once in power Lenin proved a tyrannical, murderous despot, Merridale often appears to forget this and for the bulk of the book adopts a romantic admiration for the strength of his mind, the incisive guillotine of his contempt for deviationists and backsliders, his homely lifestyle, and the sheer force of his steely personality. Nonetheless, we all know where that led, and in a tragic coda she lists the fates of many of those who travelled with him on the train: they were tortured, shot, imprisoned, exiled, or simply disappeared into the all-consuming night of Stalin\u2019s Gulag. That was the ultimate destination of Lenin\u2019s train.</p> <p><em>Lenin on the Train is published by Allen Lane (\u00a325). </em><a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/lenin-on-the-train.html?utm_source=editoriallink&amp;utm_medium=merch&amp;utm_campaign=article\" title=\"\"><em>Click here to buy it for \u00a320.50</em></a></p>",

  "<p>Slang has always fascinated me. My father, who grew up in the council estates of Slough during the second world war, knew slang words for most situations, good and bad, which I would hear regularly around the house as a child.</p> <p>Somewhere in my early 20s, I stumbled across a cheap secondhand reprint of a book by an 18th-century Londoner named Francis Grose, which recorded the everyday speech of the people he encountered in the low drinking dens, bagnios and rookeries around Covent Garden and St Giles. First published in 1785, <em>A Classical Dictionary of the Vulgar Tongue</em> remains for me the single most important slang collection of them all. Bawdy, mocking, occasionally brutal, superbly inventive and yet somehow overwhelmingly good-hearted, it helped fuel my interest these past 30-odd years in the language of everyday people \u2013 not as heard in drawing rooms or public orations, but late at night three sheets to the wind, or dodging shells in the trenches, when circumstances call for choice expressions that sum things up or cut them down.</p> <p>Having spent the past four years writing a history of English slang, it gradually became clear to me that the digital age is altering slang: both the way it evolves and is spread, and attitudes towards it. Many of the historical sayings documented in my book \u2013 such as referring to a modern-day sex worker by the 13th century term, soiled dove, or employing a 200-year-old name for a gay man, backgammon player \u2013 would now be unacceptable to someone or other online, busily taking offence on behalf of everyone else. It is all right to publish these terms in a book \u2013 or deploy a magnificent variety of them in an award-winning series such as <em>The Sopranos</em> \u2013 but try uttering any of them on social media and see how far that gets you. Is this form of speech under threat?</p> <p>Of course, slang has always had its detractors. <a href=\"file:///Volumes/Downloads/Internet%20Downloads/CN1926-01-16.pdf\" title=\"\">Ramsay MacDonald, Britain\u2019s first Labour prime minister, declared</a> in 1925 that using slang in conversation was the mark of \u201cdecadent minds\u201d, and that such talk \u201cmurders truth itself\u201d. The American lexicographer Noah Webster dismissed it in his original <a href=\"http://webstersdictionary1828.com/\" title=\"\">1828 dictionary</a> as \u201clow vulgar unmeaning language\u201d. The poet <a href=\"https://www.poets.org/poetsorg/poet/carl-sandburg\" title=\"\">Carl Sandburg</a> defined slang rather more poetically as \u201clanguage that takes off its coat, spits on its hands and goes to work\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"31c273441efcf261711621d8f5c20423796470c4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/31c273441efcf261711621d8f5c20423796470c4/88_56_1898_3094/613.jpg\" alt=\"18th century slang-collector Francis Grose.\" width=\"613\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">18th century slang-collector Francis Grose.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: to come</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Whether it goes to work or not, people have often determined that slang should be kept out of school. In October 2013, a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2013/oct/15/london-school-bans-pupils-slang-innit\" title=\"\">London academy</a> attempted to outlaw the use of certain slang words and phrases among its pupils, to help them perform well at interviews for universities and jobs. To that end, the school put up signs that read:</p> <p><em>BANNED WORDS:</em><br><em>COZ</em><br><em>AINT</em><br><em>LIKE</em><br><em>BARE</em><br><em>EXTRA</em><br><em>INNIT</em><br><em>YOU WOZ and WE WOZ</em></p> <p><em>Beginning sentences with BASICALLY</em><br><em>Ending sentences with YEAH</em></p> <p>Much slang starts out as a kind of low-level guerrilla warfare directed at straight society, designed to keep out the squares, or annoy them, and is then abandoned by the originators once the words have become common currency. Groovy was the hip new jazz word of the early 1940s, batted around by bebop musicians and pulp novelists. Twenty years later, it was as mainstream as they come, co-opted by every branch of the media \u2013 so that today it is routinely taken for a 60s term. Ageing jazzers were probably choking on their berets listening to Simon and Garfunkel in <a href=\"http://www.paulsimon.com/song/59th-street-bridge-song-feelin-groovy/\" title=\"\">The 59th Street Bridge Song</a> (1966) singing about \u201cfeeling groovy\u201d, as a once exclusive in-word suddenly flooded the airwaves.</p> <p>One obvious drawback for the slang user is that often the hip word of today turns unexpectedly into the embarrassingly square word of tomorrow. Indeed, the word \u201chip\u201d itself only became hip after its predecessor, \u201chep\u201d, fell out of favour, as noted by <a href=\"http://blogssomdearie.blogspot.co.uk/p/discography.html\" title=\"\">Blossom Dearie</a> in the song I\u2019m Hip (1966): \u201cWhen it was hip to be hep, I was hep\u201d. One example of this kind of change has a personal resonance for me. In 2000, I published a book of words and phrases drawn from a lifetime\u2019s obsession with the language of vintage crime fiction, film noir, jazz, blues, hillbilly, rockabilly and rock\u2019n\u2019roll music. I called the book <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2009/nov/14/guide-guidelines-50s-hipster-slang\" title=\"\"><em>Straight From the Fridge, Dad</em></a>, an adaptation of a slang phrase meaning \u201ccool\u201d that I\u2019d heard in that jewel among teenage exploitation films, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beat_Girl\" title=\"\"><em>Beat Girl</em></a> (1960). The book was a compendium of phrases associated with the more outre fringes of society \u2013 musicians, mobsters, beatniks, con artists \u2013 of the first half of the 20th century, the language of outsiders. In the book\u2019s subtitle, I used a term that most jazz musicians of the late 1940s bebop era would have been proud to bear \u2013 hipster \u2013 meaning someone who was one of the sharpest, the most in the know, and I had no problem calling my book <em>A Dictionary of Hipster Slang</em>.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rhr-zPTP250\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Rhr-zPTP250?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rhr-zPTP250\">Watch the trailer for Beat Girl, repository of choice slang such as \u2018straight from the fridge, dad\u2019.</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>Two years after it was published in the UK and the US, an American book appeared called <a href=\"http://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/97775/the-hipster-handbook-by-robert-lanham/9781400032013/\" title=\"\"><em>The Hipster Handbook</em></a> by Robert Lanham, full of nerdy lifestyle material seemingly aimed more at ivy league squares, and somehow this has become the default modern meaning of the term: geek chic. It describes people who, according to Lanham, enjoy \u201cstrutting in platform shoes with a biography of Che Guevara sticking out of their bags\u201d, which shows how far the word has travelled since the days of alto sax giant Charlie Parker or boogie pianist Harry \u201cthe Hipster\u201d Gibson. In Britain these days, the word hipster is frequently used as an insult, in much the same way that in the punk days of the late 1970s, one of the most damning labels you could hang on anyone was to call them a poser.</p> <p>By the same token, the slang greeting \u201cYo!\u201d has taken a long, strange path over the years. When rappers Public Enemy named their 1987 debut LP <em>Yo! Bum Rush the Show</em>, this was very much the language of the street. Yet, fast-forward two decades to an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2007/apr/08/tonyblair.labour11\" title=\"\">off-air private conversation</a> between two politicians at the G8 summit in Switzerland, as jive-talking George W Bush greets the then British prime minister Tony Blair:</p> <p>GWB: Yo! Blair, how are you doing?</p> <p>TB: I\u2019m just \u2026</p> <p>GWB: You\u2019re leaving?</p> <p>TB: No, no, no, not yet. On this trade thingy \u2026</p> <p>This kind of language is a long way from the formal, statesmanlike way in which Hollywood or the BBC have traditionally portrayed dialogues between world leaders. A little later in the conversation, Bush talks about the need \u201cto get Hezbollah to stop doing this shit\u201d. Mind you, this is a man who warned a Washington audience in 2004 about \u201cthese hateful few who have no conscience, who kill at the whim of a hat\u201d, and assured a New Hampshire chamber of commerce in 2000 that \u201cI know how hard it is for you to put food on your family\u201d, so he clearly enjoys a special relationship, not so much with England, but with the English language in general.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1e6e80a266b65239cf08b1ccff1311e287c2daa5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1e6e80a266b65239cf08b1ccff1311e287c2daa5/0_193_2200_1319/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018Yo, Blair!\u2019: George W Bush lays some slang on Tony Blair at the 2006 G8 summit, unaware of a nearby microphone.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Yo, Blair!\u2019: George W Bush lays some slang on Tony Blair at the 2006 G8 summit, unaware of a nearby microphone.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>At first glance, this might look like a straightforward example of a politician making a lamentable attempt to be \u201cdown with the kids\u201d. Yet the conversation between Bush and Blair was recorded without their knowledge, and there was no thought of trying to impress the younger members of the electorate with this language. This was not the case in 2016 when the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/may/24/ravin-chattin-roamin-eu-remain-campaign-appeals-to-young-voters\" title=\"\">Britain Stronger in Europe campaign</a> group \u2013 headed by Conservative peer Lord Rose and partly bankrolled by a number of prominent hedge-fund managers \u2013 attempted to persuade young people to vote in favour of remaining in the European Union by means of a much-derided, supposedly streetwise advert, complete with obligatory hashtag:</p> <p>WORKIN, LEARNIN, EARNIN, SHOPPIN, RAVIN, CHATTIN, ROAMIN, MAKIN, MEETIN, SHARIN, GOIN, LIVIN \u2026 Make sure you\u2019re #VOTIN</p> <p>Newspapers have generally been keen to give their readership an insight into the ways of slang. The <em>Observer</em>, only a year after it was first published in 1791, informed the public that \u201cthe slang technical term for persons in the pillory is babes in the wood\u201d. These days, most papers run \u201cnew words of the year\u201d articles, in which we are told, for example, that twerking had been brought in from the wilderness. This word for a type of dancing had been around in rap circles for roughly two decades \u2013 first surfacing in a 1992 New Orleans bounce track by DJ Jubilee called Do the Jubilee All \u2013 though the term would have meant little to anyone outside of Louisiana. A friend of mine from Texas tells me that her young son picked up the word in 2005 because so many children evacuated from New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina arrived at his school, bringing local slang with them.</p> <p>Twerking came to worldwide prominence after a performance by Miley Cyrus and Robin Thicke on 25 August 2013 at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/video/2013/aug/26/mtv-vma-miley-cyrus-criticism-video\" title=\"\">MTV\u2019s annual video music awards</a> in New York. Within days, riding the subsequent media storm, Miley had appeared alongside Justin Bieber, singing on a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2013/aug/29/miley-cyrus-justin-bieber-twerk\" title=\"\">single by rapper Lil Twist</a>. The song was called, with the deathless logic of a corporation at full cry in search of a dollar, Twerk. As blogger <a href=\"http://perezhilton.com/2013-08-28-miley-cyrus-justin-bieber-twerk-song-listen-lil-twist#.WAd6fDYrLAw\" title=\"\">Perez Hilton</a> put it: \u201cOn the heels of Miley Cyrus\u2019 twerktastic evening at the VMAs comes the single that is going to BLOW YOUR TWEEN MIND!\u201d Or not, as the case may be. Among the comments left by fans below this news item were \u201cpuke\u201d, \u201cgross\u201d, \u201cthis song sucks\u201d, and the considerably more eloquent \u201cI think this song signals there is no hope for us, it\u2019s over, we had a good run, society, however, has&#xa0;failed.\u201d</p> <p>Owing to the internet and 24-hour global media, the word twerk went from cool to embarrassing in record time, its recognition factor spreading so far outside its original core group that <a href=\"http://privateeyenews.tumblr.com/post/60443648629/from-eye-1348-by-robert-thompson\" title=\"\"><em>Private Eye</em></a> was able to print a cartoon just weeks afterwards, showing a group of elderly gents in cloth caps gyrating arthritically in a building labelled \u201cTwerking Men\u2019s Club\u201d, confident that readers of all ages would understand the meaning of the&#xa0;word.</p> <p>Slang used to come from the street, from the working stiffs, the grafters, the taxi-dancers, the jack-rollers, the winchester geese, the hep-cats, the old lags, the mollies, the lobsters and the jug-bitten. Much of the time, it still does, but it is now fighting against a tidal wave of fake language deployed by committees of marketing executives or focus groups, all desperately seeking to look cool.</p> <p>In March 1984, the <em>Guardian</em>\u2019s Washington correspondent, Alex Brummer, reported that the word yuppie was one of \u201cAmerica\u2019s hottest new status descriptions\u201d. (The other he mentioned, yummie \u2013 \u201cyoung upwardly mobile moderate\u201d \u2013 seems to have died an early death.) The same year also saw the publication of Marissa Piesman and Marilee Hartley\u2019s tongue-in-cheek work <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Yuppie-Handbook-State-Manual-Professionals/dp/067147684X\" title=\"\"><em>The Yuppie Handbook: The State-of-the-Art Manual for Young Urban Professionals</em></a>, with its cover showing a power-suited couple proudly sporting must-have items such as a Rolex watch, a Gucci briefcase and a Sony Walkman. <em>Newsweek</em> rounded off December with a <a href=\"http://2407asg14.blogspot.co.uk/2014/01/newsweek-year-of-yuppie.html\" title=\"\">cover feature</a> declaring 1984 \u201cthe year of the yuppie\u201d.</p> <p>Yet no one from the streets would have come up with a term based on the words \u201cyoung urban professional\u201d \u2013 it smacked of advertising speak. Far more authentic, and of similar vintage, was the mocking English acronym \u201clombard\u201d \u2013 loads of money but a right dickhead.</p> <p>In today\u2019s online information blizzard, billions of words are sent out into the fray in the hope of causing a Twitter storm, trending on Facebook or gaining countless plays on YouTube, alongside tap-dancing kittens and the latest celebrity wardrobe malfunction. In recent years, the move towards new slang being invented simply in order sell something or identify a target audience has greatly accelerated. Professional trend forecasters <a href=\"http://khole.net/\" title=\"\">K-Hole </a>\u2013 whose name is street slang for an after-effect of ketamine use \u2013 coined the term \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/fashion-blog/2014/feb/27/normcore-the-next-big-fashion-movement\" title=\"\">normcore</a>\u201d in 2013, in which being \u201cnormal\u201d is a supposedly radical lifestyle choice. At this year\u2019s <a href=\"https://socialmediaweek.org/london/\" title=\"\">Social Media Week</a> gathering in London, the ad for one event urged delegates to \u201cput on your marketing seatbelt and get ready for a content marketing riff-a-palooza of actionable takeaways\u201d \u2013 which sounds vaguely as if it might involve suing your local fast-food outlet \u2013 while another claimed to have identified a new target audience, the \u201cmipster\u201d, or Muslim hipster.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media-network/2016/mar/21/nerds-v-hipsters-what-sells-for-brands\">Nerds v hipsters: what sells for brands?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In the non-online world, people have been telling slang-heavy stories to their friends in bars around the world for centuries, but now if they come home drunk and do it on Twitter or Facebook, using words that are judged to be \u201cinappropriate\u201d, they might find themselves hung out to dry by modern-day vigilantes who can instantly mobilise thousands of signatories. Spend your teenage years plastering social media accounts with the latest slang and your own half-formed opinions, and in 10 years or sooner they will come back to haunt you as prospective employers trawl old sites looking into your background. This is the point at which a self-posted photo of yourself collapsed on a party floor with a toilet seat around your neck, surrounded by zombie-eyed classmates \u2013 lovingly annotated with 15 contemporary euphemisms for excessive chemical overindulgence \u2013 starts to look like a potential barrier to a career as a future archbishop&#xa0;of&#xa0;Canterbury.</p> <p>Since the 1980s, a new wave of puritanism has emerged that increasingly seeks to ban anything it holds to be suspect. Witch-hunts are conducted against words, thoughts and&#xa0;modes of behaviour. Judgments are made, sentences passed, and appeals are futile. Ultimately, slang will have no place in this world, because the best of it is guaranteed to offend someone somewhere.</p> <p>We live in an age in which pretty much every sexual activity known to the human race has been filmed and is available online \u2013 something many people in the 60s would perhaps have considered a liberated and long-overdue state of affairs. Yet numerous slang words for describing these activities would now be deemed unsayable in most public forums. That same technological advance has also made it possible to view footage of real-life atrocities, and brutality can be routinely filmed by the perpetrators using a cheap device carried in almost everyone\u2019s pocket. You can watch all of this at the click of a button, but mind your language when you talk about it.</p> <h2>Sounds modern?

The denying of this is a real taboo. One that helps to prevent proper discussion of the law on assisted dying.</p> <p>But I don\u2019t argue with it being there. This is a work in progress. It wobbles. It is messy. It should be cut. When it opens itself out to the audience \u2013 call out the names of people who you want to remember \u2013 it risks being maudlin.

  "<p>Bob Mortimer has arrived for our interview early, and so we talk for 20 minutes or so before his other half, Jim Moir \u2013 Vic Reeves \u2013 who is stuck in traffic, joins us. Mortimer sits outside the photographer\u2019s studio in the sun, chatting about the fortunes of his football team, Middlesbrough \u2013 how he and his two sons, though both at art college in London, rarely miss a match; and about the days before he was a comedian and earning his living as a solicitor in Peckham (speciality: suing the local authority for cockroach infestations. \u201cOnce you had one tenant, it was pretty easy to get the whole block onside\u2026\u201d). All the time he talks though, he has an eye on a gate out to the road. \u201cIt\u2019s not really like Jim,\u201d he says, and, \u201cHe\u2019ll be here in a minute.\u201d</p> <p>Reeves and Mortimer have called their current stage show The Poignant Moments, with due tear-jerking irony. Still, talking to Mortimer, I\u2019m struck by the more earnest edge of that sentiment. You half expect all comic duos to be at each other\u2019s throats (like <a href=\"http://www.abbottandcostello.net/\">Abbott and Costello</a>) or at least acid in their private thoughts about each other (like <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2015/aug/02/derek-and-clive-rerelease\">Pete and Dud</a>). The most poignant thing about Vic and Bob, though, is that they appear to have sustained their best-of-mates status for 30 years (while laying into each other on set with baseball bats and frying pans). In an age of singular celebrity and the stadium-filling stand-up, they are the very last of a breed: the committed double act.</p> <p>That sense is reinforced when Moir arrives grinning from behind his Eric Morecambe glasses in a tweedy suit, and they fall immediately into the familiar blunt rhythm of chat and non sequitur: the lifelong challenge of making each other laugh. Thy don\u2019t really do question and answer, so our interview feels like eavesdropping on their ongoing dialogue with the opportunity for an occasional prompt. They didn\u2019t expect to be the last of a line, Moir says, but that\u2019s a bit how it has turned out. \u201cIt\u2019s really a music hall act that we do,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd it\u2019s true I don\u2019t think there are really any others left. The Chuckle Brothers? Are Cannon and Ball still going? They say Ant and Dec are a double act, but they are just presenters.

We both have a pretty clear idea of what we want to do, and we try to keep things moving. Our thing with us has always been if people aren\u2019t interested in one bit, they won\u2019t have to wait too long for something else to happen.\u201d</p> <p>The poignancy part of the show has been sharpened by the fact that the tour had to be postponed after Mortimer was rushed into hospital for an emergency triple bypass operation last October. He had thought he had a chest infection, but his GP realised it was more serious and sent him straight to hospital. That was on the Thursday, and the operation was scheduled for the following Monday afternoon. On the Monday morning, fearing he might not make it, Mortimer married his partner of 22 years, Lisa Matthews, with special dispensation from the local registrar.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f0b996b75f0a37084b19cbc7b8448b5450f660ce\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f0b996b75f0a37084b19cbc7b8448b5450f660ce/40_0_1200_720/1000.jpg\" alt=\"From Vic Reeves Big Night out.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018We\u2019re like an indy group\u2019: Vic Reeves Big Night out.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Youtube</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cIt was obviously a shock,\u201d he says. \u201cThough I don\u2019t think it was as big a deal as I maybe thought.

But I think it\u2019s quite a normal operation these days.\u201d</p> <p>Moir insists Mortimer has come back stronger than ever, and the tour was a blessing. \u201cThe exercise is probably good for him.

The wealth of tastes and flavours available in our kitchens and supermarkets, the huge variety of takeaways and restaurants on our high streets, is something many British people take for granted.</p> <p>While the impact of foreign-born workers on the wages and employment opportunities of British-born workers is hotly debated, there are already reports of dozens of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/apr/22/curry-restaurants-crisis-immigration-rules-chefs\">curry houses closing down</a> due to a shortage of staff, something that was acknowledged by Theresa May when she was home secretary.</p> <p>The <em>Observer </em>spoke to five people working in the British food industry, each of whom has contributed something unique to their adopted country.</p> <p>Enam Ali came from Bangladesh as a teenager in 1974 and went to work in a Southampton burger bar while supporting himself through his studies, quickly abandoning the law degree his parents wanted him to take for a degree in hospitality.

And it is British \u2013 after all there is nowhere else in the world you will find onion bhaji-flavoured crisps. We are exporting mango chutney to India!\u201d</p> <p>He is worried about the impact of the immigration controls on the curry house. \u201cAlready we have a skill shortage, nobody wants to work in the kitchens, not just the Indian restaurant but the top hotels too where half the staff is European or Indian. People want to come and make some money working hard and then go, and we need that contribution. This is a great country but if people are not allowed to come, we will lose a lot from their contribution. And we will lose our curry houses.\u201d</p> <p>Marianna Leivaditaki was raised in her family\u2019s fish restaurant. \u201cMy dad caught the fish, my mum cooked it.

At first it was difficult to find work as she spoke very little English and had no qualifications or skills. But determined to do something in her host country, Kughanathan discovered a social enterprise called <a href=\"http://www.papispickles.org.uk/us/4583071587\">Papi\u2019s Pickles</a>.</p> <p>Run by a south Indian mother and daughter team, Shanthini and Abi Ramanan, it is a team of cooks who produce south Indian and Sri pickles for events, and for London\u2019s growing pop-ups and street food market scenes, while working with unemployed women from these communities.</p> <p>\u201cI wanted to work with Papi\u2019s Pickles, as we speak the same language [Tamil]; it was a huge relief. I was able to get started. This was my very first job.\u201d Kughanathan says she has been transformed from a shy, reserved person to someone who is so confident that she recently addressed a special dinner, talking about the project, and has developed her skills in the kitchen to become one of their most valued chefs, part of a team giving back to the community, completing training and vastly improving her English.</p> <p>The best bit, she says, is that her children are proud of what their mother has achieved \u2013 and now she is part of something that helps other women too.</p> <p>Edinburgh\u2019s latest restaurant will employ about 100 people when it opens next month, becoming the fifth Dishoom in the UK.</p> <p>Dishoom was founded by Shamil and Kavi Thakrar and Amar and Adarsh Radia. The first restaurant opened in Covent Garden in 2010. </p> <p>Its executive chef, Naved Nasir, learned to cook as a child in India. \u201cIt was a dream to come to London,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was a struggle at first but deep in my heart I had confidence that it would work. The great thing about being here is that you have access to the best-quality ingredients from all over the world. That\u2019s the amazing thing about being in Britain: you don\u2019t have to compromise. But I think the industry is struggling in terms of getting the right people already; the pool of staff with the right background in experience of cooking great Indian food is dwindling. And you need that experience or you lose quality.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It was a dream to come to London.

  "<p>How much short-term damage was inflicted by the Brexit vote will be revealed this week when we get an official GDP figure covering July, August and September.</p> <p>Back in the spring and early summer, Britain\u2019s national income was expanding at a healthy annual rate of 2.5%. The latest figures could show that this figure has halved and most forecasters expect next year to be no better.</p> <p>One of the supposed benefits of pulling out of the European Union \u2013 a low pound \u2013 has duly happened and sterling is around 18% lower against the dollar than it was before the referendum. This benefit is mostly reaped by exporters, who overnight find their goods cost less abroad and can therefore sell more of them.</p> <p>In the short term, though, there is a cost that kicks in before the export benefits can be realised, and that is higher import prices. Already petrol costs more than it did in June. And the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/12/tesco-running-low-key-unilever-brands-price-row-supplier-supermarket-falling-pound\" title=\"\">Marmite war between Tesco and Unilever</a> revealed there are plenty of tweaks to prices in the pipeline. There is a range of forecasts for next year\u2019s inflation rate of between 2% and 3%, up from 1% last month.</p> <p>Higher inflation, stagnant wages and slowing growth usually goes under the name stagflation. It\u2019s not a very friendly term and it\u2019s not supposed to be. It was coined in the 1970s and was supposed to remain tied to that decade, never to be repeated.</p> <p>It\u2019s like going to work with a heavy cold with the added anxiety that it might turn out to be flu. Productivity stays low and output declines.</p> <p>Unemployment, for so long the measure of Britain\u2019s jobs miracle alongside record employment figures, has started to rise. Stagflation could turn the August increase in the jobless total of 24,000 into a six figure total, with all the pain that unemployment brings.</p> <p>A 24,000 rise is the equivalent to a third of the workers in a town like Guildford, or half the number in Selby, North Yorkshire, being made redundant. More than 100,000 extra people on the dole is the same as putting Wolverhampton\u2019s entire workforce out&#xa0;of a job.</p> <p>This is an alarming thought, and not one a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/jan/18/unemployment-public-sector-strikes\" title=\"\">government has had to consider since 2011,</a> when unemployment climbed to 2.86 million, or 8.4% of the workforce. It is now 1.66 million and the jobless rate is 4.9%.</p> <p>The Brexit vote has certainly played its part in dampening the enthusiasm of businesses to invest. Other factors have played a part, though, and they could turn a year of grey skies, economically speaking, into one where it rains all the time.</p> <p>The US economy is faltering after a year of sluggish manufacturing and construction output. Like Britain, the consumer has provided the main prop for GDP growth, but increasingly people are hanging on to their cash rather than spending it.</p> <p>Investment decisions are being delayed while firms cope with the high value of the dollar, which is hampering export growth. Around 17% of British exports go to the US, which is why the UK receives a cold blast from across the Atlantic when American businesses catch a chill.</p> <p>The US Federal Reserve appears ready to disregard the fall in American growth \u2013 from 4% in 2015 to 2% this year and possibly to zero in 2017 \u2013 and make a further increase in interest rates. It is waiting until the election is over before making its move, but the warning signs are there.</p> <p>It has all the hallmarks of a disastrous decision that, for the sake of central bank dogma, will push the economy into recession.</p> <p>Britain, despite the best efforts of its own central bank, has already suffered from a downturn in global trade. A crippled US economy can only make that situation worse, adding to the pall cast by the looming exit from the European Union.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ac4559b08fc763bbff1d943a0ba0d2aa3386f886\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ac4559b08fc763bbff1d943a0ba0d2aa3386f886/0_124_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Under scrutiny: the Hermes parcel delivery company\u2019s distribution base off the M62 at Burtonwood, Cheshire.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Plague of bogus self-employment</h2> <p>Self-employment is the new outsourcing. At its most benign, the outsourcing of work to freelancers and contractors, facilitated by the internet, offers a chance to fit work around lifestyles and abandon the drudge of commuting. But for many of the 4.8 million self-employed people in the UK, the \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/20/hmrc-launch-crackdown-gig-economy-firms-agency-self-employed-staff\" title=\"\">gig economy</a>\u201d is little more than exploitation \u2013 and anyone who makes a fuss can wave goodbye to an already very uncertain income.</p> <p>Latest <a href=\"http://www.ons.gov.uk/employmentandlabourmarket/peopleinwork/employmentandemployeetypes/bulletins/uklabourmarket/latest\" title=\"\">UK labour market figures</a> show that 48% of jobs created from June to August this year were in self-employed roles. How many of these were disguised employees, hired through agencies, or, as allegedly in the case of delivery company Hermes \u2013 although it denies this \u2013 full-time staff, but without the benefits and legal protection that brings?</p> <p>HMRC has launched a specialist unit to investigate companies that opt out of giving workers employment protection by using agencies or calling staff self-employed. Labour MP <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/frank-field\" title=\"\">Frank Field</a> says Theresa May\u2019s government is showing a real willingness to grapple with this problem.</p> <p>But how rigorous will a clampdown be? In January, millions will submit personal tax returns. Those who miss the deadline will be fined. Much more seriously, individuals who lie on their return, concealing income or deliberately understating their position, can be fined up to 200% of the extra tax due, and get a potential criminal record. They could end up behind bars.</p> <p>Companies found to be using bogus self-employment to save on national insurance, pensions and holiday pay should face the same aggressive intervention. On paper, HMRC has the power to pursue businesses for historic and current PAYE deductions and to impose hefty fines. But there appears to have been a reluctance to take on big companies. Until the fines are more meaningful \u2013 say 10 times the amount of tax avoided \u2013 the law more rigorously enforced, and directors potentially hit with a criminal record \u2013 the plague of bogus self-employment will continue.</p> <h2>Green is not the only man to blame</h2> <p>Not for the first time in 2016, Sir Philip Green has had a bad week. He started it by making a plea to save his knighthood by saying he was \u201cvery, very, very sorry\u201d about the collapse of BHS, that he had made an \u201chonest mistake\u201d in selling the department store chain to Dominic Chappell and that he was still working on a deal to rescue the company\u2019s beleaguered pension scheme.</p> <p>However, MPs still voted to strip Green of his knighthood and he was labelled a \u201cbillionaire spiv\u201d, among many other things, in a heated debate in the House of Commons.</p> <p>Green deserves to be scrutinised for his stewardship of BHS, but the furore around the billionaire tycoon must not overshadow the other serious issues that have emerged from this scandal, such as the regulation of pension schemes, the role of advisers in mergers and acquisitions, and the behaviour of Chappell and his consortium Retail Acquisitions, which, at best, could be described as incompetent.</p>",
  "<p>Some 34 years ago, almost by accident, Britain\u2019s ministry of defence solved the pesky problem that had laid the Pentagon low in Vietnam. What do you do about journalists running wild in your warzone? You put them on a long, slow boat to the other side of the world. You \u2013 ahem! \u2013 take control.</p> <p>And so, from Grenada to Panama to Iraq War One, journalists were locked in little boxes as far from the action as possible before (Iraq Two) being cautiously \u201cembedded\u201d with units they depended on to keep them safe. No freelance trips here. No unwanted questions asked. Control was still the theme of each and every fighting day.</p> <p>So what are we to make of Mosul, as Kurds and Iraqis advance on the city via 24/7 streaming on Facebook Live from Al-Jazeera, <em>Channel 4 News</em> and a Kurdish agency? Do we want an emoji on every blast of destruction? \u201cLike\u201d, \u201clike\u201d, \u201clike\u201d the carnage \u2026 Is this some sort of macabre computer game?</p> <p>You\u2019d expect tabloid foes of <em>Channel 4 News</em> to have a predictable view on that \u2013 and they do. The <em>Sun</em> is apocalyptic as usual. But there\u2019s a deeper, continuing theme here. As David Patrikarakos, a specialist on the use of social media in war, <a href=\"http://edition.cnn.com/2016/10/19/opinions/mosul-facebook-live-hearts-and-minds-patrikarakos/\" title=\"\">blogs for CNN</a>, this battle is about more than just a military defeat of Isis: it\u2019s also about \u201cwinning the hearts and minds of the local population\u201d \u2013 \u201cit becomes not just a military war, but also a narrative war, in which the latter is arguably more important\u201d.</p> <p>The Kurds need to see Isis being driven back. Baghdad needs to see its army rolling forward. The Middle East needs to witness bloody extremism in retreat. And Americans, weighing their pending votes, need to see White House strategies working. Run the whole show, start to finish, on Facebook Live and the story \u2013 in putative triumph \u2013 serves a precise political purpose (just as Isis\u2019s murderous hostage videos have a purpose, too). Watch the disparate forces of law and fragile order defeat the agents of chaos. Know that, at last, something can be done.</p> <p>Thus, at root, the procession of tanks ploughing across dust bowls and puffs of smoke on the horizon is propaganda as well as a form of actuality. No one knows how they\u2019ll cope if, indeed, the fight for Mosul drags on over months. No one knows what will happen if we see war in all its horror close to (though <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/oct/18/channel-4-news-facebook-live-battle-for-mosul-al-jazeera\" title=\"\">C4 promises </a>to be \u201ccautious and vigilant that the material is appropriate at all times and have measures in place to stop the stream when necessary\u201d). And nobody knows whether the stream will suddenly run dry if victory turns to defeat.</p> <p>Taking control, in short, hasn\u2019t gone out of fashion. Nor has the fog of war. Never forget one basic rule of propaganda. Now you see it, now you don\u2019t.</p>",

  "<p>It\u2019s not very rock\u2019n\u2019roll, but I\u2019ve always loved an energy rating. A third of the UK\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions come from Energy Using Products (EUPs) in offices and industry and also, significantly, in our own homes, too. The ones we control can really help to reduce that percentage, so choosing the best energy-rated model makes sense.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-new-eu-energy-label-explained\">EU energy labels</a> give us an easy way to power down. Regulated by European law, they can help us see how efficient a product is before we buy it, and also mandate vampirical products that suck power out of the grid when you think they\u2019re asleep (since 2010 products cannot have standby power greater than 1W). Don\u2019t ask me what happens after Brexit. I worry about that, too.</p> <p>For now, <a href=\"https://www.sust-it.net/\">sust-it.net</a> rates a Panasonic as its most energy-efficient TV. Today, TVs are 60% more efficient than they were five years ago. That has everything to do with energy ratings.</p> <p>However, ultra high definition (UHD) TVs are not so efficient. They offer impressive definition \u2013 but the waste is phenomenal. If America switches its 300m HD TVs to UHD, annual electricity consumption will increase by 8bn kilowatt hours. To make matters worse, an investigation by the <a href=\"https://www.nrdc.org/\">NRDC</a> (National Resources Defence Council) found that TV manufacturers in the US may be <a href=\"https://www.nrdc.org/sites/default/files/uhd-tv-energy-use-report.pdf\">manipulating their energy ratings</a>. The NRDC reported that energy consumption for popular TV models (I am yet to determine whether any are available in the UK) that seemed efficient under test conditions soared by up to 50% in real world use.</p> <p>Meanwhile in Europe, a review of appliance ratings, the Smart Testing of Energy Products (Step), will report later this year and hopefully restore my faith in energy ratings. Until then, do not adjust your sets.</p> <h2>The big picture: let there be light!</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0594f57f765f82c6d951141f5388e7dc3feb4c31\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0594f57f765f82c6d951141f5388e7dc3feb4c31/0_3_3596_2158/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Solar system: this electricity-free light costs just $5.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Solar system: this electricity-free light costs just $5.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR Company Handout</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The international charity SolarAid has a grand plan to light up Africa, providing light to 598 million people on the continent who lack access to electricity.

  "<h2><strong>Arena: The Roundhouse \u2013 The People\u2019s Palace </strong></h2> <p><strong>10pm, BBC4</strong><br>This profile of the storied London venue begins in the 1960s with drugs, \u201chappenings\u201d and counter-culture. It ends with the current staff having a bake-off. It\u2019s tempting to see this as a metaphor for the pacification of pop culture over the intervening years. However, this one-off programme does emphasise the Roundhouse\u2019s adaptability: it\u2019s embraced enough change in its 50 years to suggest that further reinvention is always possible. <em>Phil Harrison</em></p> <h2><strong>Virginia McKenna\u2019s Born Free </strong></h2> <p><strong>7pm, Channel 4<br></strong>In this evocative documentary marking the 50th anniversary of family favourite Born Free, the Bafta-winning actor and Born Free Foundation co-founder returns with her son to Kenya, where she and her late husband Bill Travers filmed their rather risky \u201clife with the lions\u201d drama.

It\u2019s always been clear that other planets have weather that put our own temperate fluctuations to shame; Jupiter\u2019s red spot, big enough to accommodate two Earths, is a perma-storm that has raged since Galileo\u2019s time. Still more fabulous is the story of Saturn, where rains come in downpours of diamonds and rubies. <em>David Stubbs</em></p> <h2>Poldark </h2> <p><strong>9pm, BBC1<br></strong>Things are looking dire for Ross and Demelza, with their prospecting serving up precious little of the copper they hoped for. Ross is up in court too, after the smuggling incident; but such concerns begin to fade when he makes a different discovery, one that could turn around the mine\u2019s fortunes. And just in the nick of time. Meanwhile, as Elizabeth\u2019s mother falls ill, George makes her an offer she can\u2019t refuse.

Tutankhamun aspires to the status of both proper British drama and classic ripping yarn \u2013 sort of a cross between Downton Abbey and Raiders Of The Lost Ark \u2013 and while it reaches neither of those heights, it\u2019s serviceable matinee-variety fare. Tonight, the hunt for the tomb wrestles for airtime with a love triangle subplot. <em>Andrew Mueller</em></p> <h2>Chicago Med </h2> <p><strong>9pm, Universal<br></strong>There\u2019s much mopping up to do of old plot lines and fresh bodily fluids as the medical element in Law &amp; Order overlord Dick Wolf\u2019s Chicago franchise returns for season two. Dr Rhodes and Dr Choi both get off to rocky starts in their new roles, April struggles with her TB diagnosis, and Sarah accepts a psych residency after helping a suicidal teenager.

There are other treasures, too: the suave malice of Dennis Price\u2019s draper\u2019s assistant-cum serial killer Mazzini; the portrayal of Edwardian England and its snobby mores; and the delicious glee with which the awful upper classes are dispatched. With family bitterness, betrayal and murder on a scale to rival the Borgias, this is a cold and subversive comedy. <em>Paul Howlett</em></p> <p><strong>The Chronicles Of Narnia: The Voyage Of The Dawn Treader<br>(Michael Apted, 2010), 6.45pm, E4</strong><br>Young Edmund (Skandar Keynes) and Lucy (Georgie Henley) Pevensie, plus cowardly cousin Eustace (Will Poulter), set sail on this third Narnia adventure, this time aboard King Caspian\u2019s galleon the Dawn Treader.

  "<p>It\u2019s one of the most common gardening tips going: apply spent coffee grounds around your garden for amazing results. A quick internet search for \u201ccoffee grounds + plants\u201d will draw up close to four million hits, with consistent claims they can add essential minerals to the soil, boost populations of friendly soil bacteria and even reduce the pH of growing media for acid-loving plants like rhododendrons. In fact, on a trip to an achingly eco organic coffee shop in San Francisco last year I saw big barrels of used coffee grounds with scoops and brown bags, free to customers to collect, under a sign detailing their many horticultural virtues. What a great idea!</p> <p>Always keen to try out a quirky horticultural tip, and being a bit of a caffeine fiend, I decided to put the theory to the test this summer on two identical vegetable beds containing a mix of tomatoes, lettuce, herbs and flowers. Now, this was hardly a rigorous scientific trial, just a rough-and-ready experiment to satisfy passing curiosity. I\u2019d just dump my daily coffee grounds on the surface as a mulch once they had cooled (the way books and blogs suggest), creating a beautiful dark inch-thick layer of coffee compost by the end of the summer.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The growth of pretty much everything in the coffee bed became noticeably worse in about two weeks.</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>And the results? Well, here\u2019s the deal. The crop yield and growth of pretty much everything in the coffee bed became noticeably worse within about two weeks of application. Plant growth slowed, some developed leaf yellowing, others defoliated and died. Seedling germination in some cases was almost completely inhibited. While some species looked OK, none of the plants in the coffee group proved better than my basic control. But it\u2019s just adding organic matter. What went wrong?</p> <p>So I had a look at the scientific literature, and frankly I kicked myself. Coffee grounds are of course a rich source of caffeine \u2013 in fact they can be richer than coffee itself, depending on brewing technique. One of the key functions of caffeine in the plants that produce it is allelopathy \u2013 the ability to reduce competition from surrounding species by suppressing their growth. Caffeine is packed into coffee seeds for the very function of suppressing the germination of other seeds.</p> <p>There is a stack of studies to suggest it also stalls root growth in young plants, preventing their uptake of water and nutrients. Yet others have shown it has antibacterial effects (so much for boosting soil bacteria). And guess what? It isn\u2019t even always very acidic. OK, its effects have varied widely depending on plant species, but it\u2019s never shown colossal benefits that could outweigh the risks. I love a quirky piece of hort advice, and some are repeated so often you assume they are true, but often they call them old wives\u2019 tales for a reason. </p> <p><em>Email James at <a href=\"mailto:james.wong@observer.co.uk\">james.wong@observer.co.uk</a> or follow him on Twitter <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Botanygeek?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\">@Botanygeek</a></em></p>",
  "<p>In London an exhibition has just opened at the Barbican called <a href=\"https://www.barbican.org.uk/artgallery/event-detail.asp?ID=18736\">The Vulgar</a>. It is a fashion exhibition, with clothes that are often funny, but spotlit on mannequins so nobody laughs. There\u2019s a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2015/sep/10/hussein-chalayan-gravity-fatigue-dance-choreography-fashion-interview\">Hussein Chalayan</a> dress covered in false nails, a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2016/jan/08/andre-courreges\">Courr\u00e8ges</a> minidress and 18th-century gowns the width of a studio flat. There are gold things. There are fans, which became vulgar when they were mass-produced. There are neo-classical dresses, vulgar because they are copies. Accompanying the fashions are definitions of the word by psychoanalyst Adam Phillips, which inspire the titles of each room: \u201cShowing Off,\u201d \u201cPuritan,\u201d \u201cExtreme Bodies,\u201d \u201cToo Popular,\u201d and \u201cCommon\u201d.</p> <p>I sat with a cup of tea afterwards with one eye on Twitter. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/lilyallen\">Lily Allen </a>had been to the Jungle camp in Calais with the BBC and met a 13-year-old boy from Afghanistan. She broke down as she explained to him: \u201cAt three different intervals\u2026 the English in particular have put you in danger\u2026 We\u2019ve bombed your country, put you in the hands of the Taliban and now put you in danger of risking your life to get into our country. I apologise on behalf of my country. I\u2019m sorry for what we have put you through.\u201d On Twitter she was dismissed as \u201cpampered, coiffured and irrelevant\u201d, urged to \u201cspeak for herself, not the nation \u2013 she represents nobody\u201d, and received multiple warnings of rape, both for her and her daughters.</p> <p>The<em> Sun </em>said hers were \u201ccrocodile tears\u201d, writing: \u201cBefore Lily starts \u2018apologising\u2019 for Brit troops taking on the Taliban, perhaps she should say sorry for her own mistakes. Two years ago her appalling single \u2018URL Badman\u2019 tanked at No 93. Earlier this year the attention-seeking mum passed out after a bender at the Notting Hill Carnival.\u201d <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/columnists/article-3837232/Lily-Allen-s-tears-pure-self-indulgence-according-JAN-MOIR.html\">Jan Moir dedicated her <em>Daily Mail</em></a><em> </em>column to Allen: \u201cJust another indulged idiot who fondly imagines herself to be a daring and provocative political voice\u2026 Darling Lily got a fabulous manicure, put on an ever-so-serious, no-make-up face and took a camera crew with her to visit the Jungle. (There ain\u2019t much in the way of practical work a gal can do with those nails, but never mind.) It looked quite good when Lily was filmed ladling out the soup for five minutes,\u201d she said, adding: \u201cThe 31-year-old mother of two started crying, which must have been very confusing for the little boy, not to mention scary \u2013 but at least she didn\u2019t sing.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>How dare Lily Allen have an opinion about immigration? That is not what Lily Allen is for</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>As I read the criticism, one of Phillips\u2019s definitions flashed to mind. Vulgar: \u201cImpossible ambition: the arrivistes, the nouveau riche, the immigrants, the upwardly mobile.\u201d People trying to be something they are not. People, like Allen, who should know their place. People trespassing on politics, on grown-up issues. She\u2019s not even a good mother so why should we take her seriously? She doesn\u2019t even have the right NAILS. How dare Lily Allen have an opinion about immigration? That is not what Lily Allen is for.</p> <p>Once the concept of vulgarity is in your head it\u2019s hard to shake it out \u2013 you recognise it in debates about Brexit, anti-semitism, homophobia. You start questioning why people like Jan Moir and the furious Tweeters find Allen\u2019s visit to Calais so threatening. Like a pensioner wearing a Topshop catsuit, Allen is parading her inappropriate views and emotions in full view of a crowd. She is getting above her station and needs to be knocked back. It\u2019s not simply about her celebrity \u2013 I can\u2019t remember a single furious column when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/feb/22/this-seems-like-a-solvable-problem-jude-law-on-helping-calais-refugees\">Jude Law visited Calais</a>, or <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/mar/03/hollywood-stars-to-help-calais-children-reunite-with-uk-families\">Benedict Cumberbatch spoke of the \u201cutter disgrace of the British government\u201d</a> for not doing enough. But their visits weren\u2019t \u201cvulgar\u201d \u2013 there is nothing that disorients us about well-educated men speaking passionately. That\u2019s how the world is meant to sound, regardless of what they\u2019re saying.</p> <p>In the shadow of the exhibition, the whole episode made me feel sorry for those rising up to chastise Allen. If her tears and nails and apology require such scorn, doesn\u2019t it suggest a degree of desperation and fear in the scornful? After spending time with those clothes, those images, the 19th-century etiquette manuals and Elizabethan document \u201cenforcing the status of apparel\u201d on materials that were restricted according to class, I sense an ancient anxiety that the barriers these judgers rely on for structure might be disappearing. The risk being then, that their houses would simply crumble.</p> <p>Email Eva at <a href=\"mailto:e.wiseman@observer.co.uk\">e.wiseman@observer.co.uk</a> or follow her on Twitter <a href=\"https://twitter.com/EvaWiseman?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\">@EvaWiseman</a></p>",

Light enough to tackle long climbs, comfortable over long distances and yet stiff enough to provide rapid acceleration sprinting out of corners.</p> <p>I personally hadn\u2019t heard of Alchemy before coming across the Helios. But it\u2019s just one of many bespoke and high-end bike brands that will be on display at the upcoming <a href=\"http://rouleurclassic.cc/\">Rouleur Classic</a> event being held in London from 3-5 November. Billed as the world\u2019s finest road cycling show, it\u2019s a chance for you to get close to some remarkable bikes while also rubbing shoulders with the sport\u2019s biggest stars. This year the likes of David Millar, Sean Kelly, Jan Bakelants, Jan Ullrich, Laura Trott and Jason Kenny will be there.</p> <p>Although Alchemy will happily build you a bike to your exact specifications, they also offer six stock sizes if you happen to fall into one of those sizes. I am just under 6ft tall and the 56cm frame fitted me really well. In order for me to experience it, a very special bike was created. </p> <p>Some of its stand-out components included the ENVE SES 3.4 carbon wheelset, which has been designed to perform over all kinds of terrain and in all weather conditions. Aerodynamic to carry speed, but with a wide rim profile to keep the wheels stable in winds. The pair weighed in at just 1.3kg. One thing that separates ENVE from a number of other carbon wheel manufacturers is in their construction process. Most manufacturers build the rim and then drill holes for the spokes. ENVE, however, hand lay the carbon around the holes which creates a rim that can be tensioned more than others, resulting in a far stiffer wheel. New this year is a textured braking surface which provides better braking in all conditions. ENVE say this improves braking by 30%. I was certainly very impressed with the stopping distances \u2013 even if under heavy braking the wheels did scream like banshees!</p> <p>The groupset was the Shimano Di2 matched to Dura-Ace as ridden by Team Sky. Di2 provides shifting that remains consistently pinpoint accurate all the time. Changing gear requires only the lightest of touches \u2013 simply the press of a button. Motors in the derailleurs allow for poorly timed shifts and will even shift under extreme load quickly and reliably. With Shimano\u2019s diagnostics, you can even plug the bike into a laptop and custom tune your gears to personal preference \u2013 from changing the functions of the buttons to how fast you want the shifts to be. The battery will last approximately 2,500km between charges. </p> <p>I spent more than 8 hours in the saddle on a sunny Saturday in the Chilterns. The beautiful scenery matched by the performance of the Alchemy (and the good company of my fellow riders) made it a dream ride.</p> <p>The sums involved in creating a bike like this are, frankly, insane and when I returned the bike on Monday all in one piece I was mighty relieved. This is the full breakdown of the set up. The cheapest thing on the menu was the bar tape \u2013 which I have to say was superb!</p> <p>2017 Achemy Helios Di2 frameset: \u00a34,400<br>ENVE SES 3.4 carbon clincher wheelset: \u00a32,750<br>ENVE carbon road handlebar: \u00a3300<br>ENVE carbon road stem: \u00a3320<br>ENVE 25mm Layback carbon seatpost: \u00a3250<br>Astute Taca\u2019 Skylite VT carbon saddle: \u00a3200<br>Vrederstein Fortezza Senso tyres: \u00a346.95 x 2<br>Arundel Gecko Grip bar tape: \u00a315<br>Arundel Mandible carbon bottle cage: \u00a360 x 2<br>Shimano Dura Ace Di2 groupset: \u00a32,967.99</p> <p>Total = \u00a311,417</p> <p><em>Email Martin at </em><a href=\"mailto:martin.love@observer.co.uk\"><em>martin.love@observer.co.uk</em></a><em> or follow him on Twitter </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/MartinLove166\"><em>@MartinLove166</em></a></p>",
  "<p>It is the classic <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPzzgE34YQY\" title=\"\"><em>Spitting Image</em> sketch</a> of Margaret Thatcher in her pomp. The satirists created a scene in which the rubber puppet of the prime minster sat at a restaurant table surrounded by her cabinet. She orders raw steak. The waitress then asks: \u201cAnd what about the vegetables?\u201d Motioning to her cringing ministers, Mrs T replies: \u201cThey\u2019ll have the same as me.\u201d</p> <p>That was a caricature. In his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/oct/16/kind-of-blue-political-memoir-ken-clarke-review\" title=\"\">recently published memoir</a>, Ken Clarke contends that the \u201cIron Lady\u201d liked ministers who argued back and she promoted him even though they had many humdinger rows. But the Thatcher legend remains very lively in the Tory imagination. It was played up to by Theresa May when she arrived at Number 10 just over 100 days ago. <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/07/08/the-iron-mayden-how-newspapers-in-britain-and-around-the-world-r/\" title=\"\">\u201cIron Mayden\u201d and \u201cthe new Maggie\u201d</a> were among the welcoming headlines in the rightwing press. Her team didn\u2019t object. They did not discourage anyone from portraying her as a reincarnation of the dominatrix of folklore.</p> <p>In her early days at Number 10, there was an ambition to achieve a grip over government more steely than that achieved by Mrs T even at the zenith of her power. Ministers reported that they were being forbidden to make any statement or give any interview unless it had first been cleared through Number 10. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jul/17/theresa-may-brexit-early-general-election\" title=\"\">I wrote at the time</a> that Mrs May would discover that she would not be able to impose such a stifling level of control. What I did not foresee \u2013 and neither did she nor anyone else \u2013 is just how rapidly cabinet cohesion would unravel. Discipline is now breaking down in a way that Mrs T would never have tolerated.</p> <p>There are almost daily reveals of confidential papers prepared for internal discussions between ministers, especially of anything touching on Brexit. Mrs May says she will not give a \u201crunning commentary\u201d on how she plans to approach the negotiations. We don\u2019t need one because we have a running tap of leaks from within her cabinet. These are being accompanied by a drip feed of poisonous briefings, as some ministers try to promote themselves and their ambitions at the expense of rivals they seek to thwart or damage.</p> <p>At the most recent prime minister\u2019s questions, Mr Clarke was moved to <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/ken-clarke-accuses-brexit-tory-ministers-of-launching-political-attacks-on-cabinet-colleagues_uk_58075ecbe4b07ebc072be99a\" title=\"\">condemn the \u201cBrexiter ministers\u201d</a> whom he identified as the principal culprits. He urged Mrs May to get them under control. The majority of the cabinet agree. Most of them are not incessantly leaking and relentlessly briefing. The well behaved are growing furious with the troublemakers. \u201cKen is right,\u201d says one senior minister angered by the antics of some of his colleagues. \u201cTheresa needs to grip this before it spirals out of control.\u201d It only takes a few to make mischief. It doesn\u2019t take long for mischief to turn into mayhem. The next stop on the line after mayhem is anarchy.</p> <p>The copious leaking and nasty briefing is being accompanied by a mounting number of public rebukes by Number 10 of ministers who are deemed to have spoken out of turn. The three Brexiters \u2013 Boris Johnson, David Davis and Liam Fox \u2013 have all been give the ceremonial \u201cslap-down\u201d. This was the cause of some satisfaction over at the Treasury, which has had a never less than fractious relationship with the Brexiters.</p> <p>Last week, it was the turn of the second most important person in the government to feel the sting of the prime minister\u2019s displeasure. On Wednesday, the chancellor suggested that students could be excluded from the net migration target. The following day, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/oct/20/students-could-be-left-out-of-immigration-figures-ministers-hint\" title=\"\">he was publicly told off</a> by the next-door neighbour when Number 10 declared that this was \u201ccategorically\u201d not Mrs May\u2019s position. These reprimands are only superficially a display of strength. If ministers were really afraid of incurring the wrath of the boss, they would not get out of line in the first place.</p> <p>Some of Mrs May\u2019s problems with managing her government are down to her style. She is famous among colleagues for what one minister calls her \u201clong silences\u201d. She lets other people babble on, while giving away little about what she thinks. Many of us have encountered managers who think this is a clever technique. The trouble with it as a way of running a government is that it leaves ministers without a clear guide to what the boss really wants and encourages the pursuit of individual agendas.</p> <p>Tony Blair was much attacked for emasculating the cabinet as a decision-making body and making the big calls with small huddles of trusties in the prime ministerial den, what became known as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2006/may/16/comment.labour\" title=\"\">\u201csofa government\u201d</a>. A similar criticism was levelled at David Cameron. Mrs May set out with the intention of restoring the traditional model of \u201ccollective cabinet responsibility\u201d. Ministers would argue things out in private. Everyone would get an opportunity to have their say behind closed doors, but once a decision was made, all would be expected to unify around it in public. There is a lot to be said in favour of a less cliquey, more formal method of cabinet government, but it can only work if everyone can be relied on to obey the rules.</p> <p>Mrs May is beginning to learn why her predecessors became so wary of having frank and full-blooded discussions in cabinet and its committees. Unless everyone around the table can be trusted to respect the confidentiality of the meeting, there is a high risk that partial accounts of their discussions will be leaked by ministers seeking to advantage themselves and undermine competitors.</p> <p>Then there is a lingering legacy of the coalition years. When the Conservative and Lib Dem ministers first went into government together, they colluded in the fiction that they were all one big happy family. As time went on and tensions increased, they became more open about ventilating their differences in public. This loosened the bonds of collective responsibility. They were then shattered when <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-35230959\" title=\"\">David Cameron permitted his cabinet</a> to campaign on both sides of the Brexit referendum. Ministers acquired the habit of arguing with each other on TV \u2013 and in the most vituperative terms.</p> <p>It is harder for the prime minister to reassert the authority of her office when she hasn\u2019t won an election in her own right. Some of her friends think she ought to make an example of one of the leakers and fire him, but that would be risky when she has a small majority and a large number of enemies already sitting on her backbenches.</p> <p>Added to that is a change in the dynamics between Numbers 10 and 11. The most important relationship in any government is that between the prime minister and chancellor. When they form a solid axis, they can dominate the cabinet. If that relationship breaks down, all hell tends to break loose. Mrs May chose Philip Hammond as her chancellor because she has known him since they were at Oxford together and they had a decent relationship as ministers. His unflashy, deadpan style seemed suited to the challenge of soothing markets rattled by Brexit.</p> <p>The duo now find themselves, to an extent neither had anticipated, on different sides of several arguments. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/17/philip-hammond-not-lone-voice-caution-on-brexit\" title=\"\">His priority </a>is to protect financial services, the car industry and all the other elements of the economy that will be imperilled by a bad Brexit. That angles him towards a softer version of departure than the prime minister, who places much more emphasis on control of immigration. It ought to disturb them both that they have already got to the point where he has to deny that he is contemplating resignation and she has to issue a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/17/philip-hammonds-brexit-worries-point-to-cabinet-tensions\" title=\"\">statement expressing \u201cfull confidence\u201d</a> in her chancellor.</p> <p>It used to be a reliable rule that divided parties don\u2019t win elections. Tories can be forgiven for thinking that this stricture doesn\u2019t apply to them anymore, especially in the absence of a credible threat from their external opponents. The Conservatives were obviously divided about Europe before the 2015 election and still managed to squeak a parliamentary majority. They fought each other viciously during the referendum and that battle goes on in a new form. Yet they still enjoy double-digit leads in opinion polls. This is encouraging some Tories to believe that there is no longer a penalty for being undisciplined.</p> <p>Yet there are big reasons why it does still matter that the government is advertising its divisions to the world. It is hard to come to sensible decisions when the cabinet leaks like a sieve. As a writer about politics and as a citizen, I love a juicy leak, because it exposes arguments within government that would otherwise remain hidden. But I take the point that it becomes impossible for ministers to conduct candid and productive discussions if they live in constant fear that anything they say to each other in private will appear on the front page of the next day\u2019s newspapers. Making a success of Brexit \u2013 or at least limiting the economic damage inflicted by it \u2013 will depend on fashioning a coherent and unified negotiating position and convincing the EU that Britain has a serious and trustworthy government. That is all undermined when key ministers are at war with each other. It also compounds the Brexit-induced febrility in financial markets.</p> <p>As for Mrs May, she acquired her early popularity with voters by projecting herself as a steady and competent hand on the tiller. That image will be increasingly hard to sustain when the public begins to notice that her crew are at each other\u2019s throats.</p>",
  "<p>The federal environment and energy minister, Josh Frydenberg, will work with the operators of a controversial oil and gas port after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/oct/22/approval-of-port-melville-supply-base-near-darwin-quashed-by-federal-court\">a court overturned a decision to approve it</a> without an environmental impact assessment.</p> <p>However it is unlikely the project will undergo the long called-for assessment but rather an earlier departmental investigation would be re-examined. </p> <p>The $130m Port Melville facility on the Tiwi Islands off the coast of Darwin, includes a deep water port and 30m-litre tank farm for fuel storage and distribution.
