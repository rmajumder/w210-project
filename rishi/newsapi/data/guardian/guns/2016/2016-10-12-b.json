There was a minor outbreak in 2013, but not on the scale of what\u2019s happening now. They proceed through copycat behaviour. And at a time when social and mainstream media are caught in a feedback loop of mutual amplification, they spread quickly. </p> <p>\u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t it go viral?\u201d he asks of the most recent scare. \u201cIt\u2019s unnerving and funny at the same time.\u201d </p> <p>But why are clowns scary? Radford says that sanitised, domesticated clowns like Bozo and Ronald McDonald obscure the fact that clowns have always been, at best, ambivalent figures. </p> <p>\u201cDarker, more sinister currents and threads go back to the earliest versions of the clown. The clown has always been an ambiguous character. Clowns were never really good, so it\u2019s not really accurate to ask when clowns turned bad. They never claimed to be good.\u201d</p> <p>We can never be sure, when clowns are laughing, whether or not it\u2019s at our expense. </p> <p>\u201cThe court jester was a figure who had license to speak ill of anyone including the king. The clown has always had a license to say things that are impolitic or rude.\u201d</p> <p>If we look at them over the long term, Radford explains in his book, they\u2019re less like the benevolent figure of hamburger ads and birthday parties, and more like the trickster archetype, a category that Radford points out includes the devil. </p> <p>Clowns have long associated with bad behaviour. Punch, the British figure of folklore and street theatre, is a \u201cwife-beating, mass-murdering infanticidal monster\u201d. Pagliacci murdered his wife in costume. And in The Pickwick Papers, Dickens presented a clown whose private life was one of alcoholic dissipation. </p> <p>Only later, especially in the USA, did \u201cthe happy, good polite clown become the clown that we all recognise.\u201d </p> <p>More recently, writers and filmmakers in the horror genre saw an opportunity to restore the balance. </p> <p>\u201cPeople like Stephen King took that character on its head, but really he was picking up the threads of the earlier, scary clown.\u201d</p> <p>Beyond this history, there\u2019s something viscerally confronting about seeing a clown in makeup. </p> <p>\u201cThe most obvious thing that is unnerving is the mask. Their human features are hidden, and instead this grotesque version of human features is there.\u201d </p> <p>The makeup, designed for the big top, does not always come off well in face to face encounters. </p> <p>\u201cThe intent isn\u2019t to be frightening, but it is, especially close up. Masks help hide identity and strip away information that we use to read people. Suddenly, you\u2019re dealing with a masked stranger near you, and possibly near your kids.\u201d</p> <p>We tend to want our clowns to be cordoned off, for safety.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2016/oct/05/clown-sightings-south-carolina-alabama\">Clown sightings: the day the craze began</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cWe like our clowns in very specific, socially prescribed contexts,\u201d like circuses, birthday parties, or rodeos. \u201cIf you see a clown walking around your street late at night, there\u2019s no context for that. It\u2019s boundary violation that creeps people out.\u201d</p> <p>Especially when seen in a suburban street, clowns also perhaps violate or blur the distinction between the real and the imaginary.

And indeed, there have been incidents of people using weapons in their clown encounters, or arming themselves on the off chance that they\u2019ll have one. </p> <p>We should turn away from such paranoia, and instead try, while the craze lasts, to embrace the archetype in all its ambiguity.

  "<p>Justifying poor policy often makes politicians say dumb things, and yesterday we saw a classic case by the minister for finance, Senator Mathias Cormann, as he attempted to argue that a tax cut for people earning over $80,000 was necessary to encourage part-time workers make the \u201cadditional effort\u201d to work full-time.</p> <p>The policy to increase the threshold of the 37% income tax bracket from $80,001 to $87,001 is notionally about reducing bracket creep.</p> <p>Bracket creep occurs when due to a wage rise you move into a higher tax bracket. In effect, it is a tax increase by stealth. For example, a person earning $79,000 who got a 2% wage rise to $80,580, goes from paying a marginal tax rate of 32.5% to 37%.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2016/oct/13/coalition-embarrassed-by-mistaken-support-for-labor-vote-politics-live\">Coalition embarrassed by mistaken support for Labor vote \u2013 politics live</a> </p> </aside>  <p> But we need a bit of context. They would only be paying 37% tax for the $579 they earned above $80,001, the rest would be unchanged.</p> <p>The tax changes mean that now instead of going into a higher tax bracket, this person would remain with a tax rate of 32.5%. It makes a difference of $26 a year less in tax.</p> <p>The biggest tax cut anyone will get is those who earn over $87,001 \u2013 they will get a cut of $315 a year, or $6 a week.</p> <p>Some economists care about bracket creep because they believe it is a deterrent to work \u2013 in effect you will choose not to work extra hours or cut back on your hours to avoid the higher tax bracket. And as result, workforce participation is reduced.</p> <p> It\u2019s a nice argument, but it works better in theory than in practice.</p> <p>In reality, what studies have found is that people keep working the same amount, they just try to reduce their <em>taxable</em> income by either reducing non-wage income or using new ways to increase their income deductions.</p> <p>But most people don\u2019t earn over $80,000, let alone $87,000. As a result, this measure is greatly targeted to the wealthy.</p> <p> It was on this point that Cormann found himself selling economic snake oil.</p> <p>While debating the legislation yesterday in the Senate, the Greens Senator, Peter Whish-Wilson, asked Cormann who would receive the benefit of the tax. He replied that \u201cthe government is focusing on average full-time wage earners, and no average full-time wage earner will miss out on this tax cut.\u201d</p> <p>Now this is some pretty sneaky use of language.</p> <p>Cormann is right to suggest that \u201cno average full-time wage earner\u201d will miss out. The current average \u201cordinary\u201d full-time earnings is $78,832 \u2013 requiring just a 1.5% increase to get to $80,000 by the end of 2016-17.</p> <p>But the average wage is a very skewed way to look at income.</p> <p>If you have nine people earning $50,000 and one person earning $150,000 then the average earnings of that group is $60,000 even though only one person in the group earns at least that amount.</p> <p>And when talking about \u201caverage full-time workers\u201d things get even more skewed because 63% of all full-time workers are men, and their average wage is much higher than that of women.</p> <p>The current average total full-time earnings for men is $88,223, while for women it is just $71,245.</p> <p>So when Cormann talks of average full-time workers, he is really talking average male full-time workers.</p> <p>And while \u201caverage\u201d sounds like you are talking about someone on middle income, it is actually talking about the top third of wage earners.</p> <p>In 2013-14, when the average annual full-time earnings was $78,972, the median taxable income for men was $62,000, and for women it was just $47,284:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Average and median earnings - 2013-14\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/7qQHD/2/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p> In that year, just 35% of men had a taxable income above the average full-time amount, and just 17% of women:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Cumulative percentage of taxable incomes by gender in 2013-14\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/OwtNQ/1/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p> So in no way are those earning $80,000 on \u201cmiddle incomes\u201d.</p> <p> But rather than suggest the tax cut was designed to benefit such workers, Cormann yesterday tried to spin it as a marvel of incentives for part-time workers.</p> <p><a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B22M0xfyePYkcjhjSmswbVBVWDQ/view\">He argued of the policy </a>that \u201cthe whole purpose is to provide an incentive for part-time workers to work more hours without being penalised with a higher tax rate.

  "<p>The apparent suicide of a Los Angeles police department detective who was investigating a rape allegation against NBA star Derrick Rose is a dramatic turn that has injected uncertainty into the<a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/11/derrick-rose-rape-trial-judge-considers-mistrial\"> lawsuit against him.</a><br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>News that Nadine Hernandez had been found dead jolted the civil trial on Wednesday and opened a potentially new legal front in the closely watched case. </p> <p>Officers found Hernandez, 44, suffering from a single gunshot wound to the chest on Tuesday afternoon in a home in Whittier, about 20 miles south-east of downtown LA, according to the Whittier police department. She was ferried to PIH Health Hospital where she died at 3.27pm.</p> <p>There was no sign of foul play, a Whittier police spokesman said. \u201cThis incident is being investigated as a suicide. However, this is an ongoing investigation.\u201d</p> <p>The news added a macabre twist on what was already a dramatic day in the US district court where a woman is seeking $21.5m compensation for allegedly being raped by Rose and two of his friends. </p> <p>The 30-year-old alleged victim, known as Jane Doe, appeared shocked when Mark Baute, a lawyer for Rose, made the announcement.</p> <p>Baute, who has mounted a combative defense of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/new-york-knicks\">New York Knicks</a> point guard, told the court that the detective had told him \u201cthere\u2019s no rape case here\u201d and had alerted him to potentially damning texts from Doe to Rose which her lawyers had withheld from the defense.</p> <p>During a break in the trial one of Doe\u2019s lawyers, Brandon Anand, told journalists the detective had in fact believed there was a case: \u201cShe unequivocally stated that a crime had been committed.\u201d He said the detective had visited Doe at her parents\u2019 home in northern California less than a month ago.</p> <p>The contradictory versions added an extra layer of dispute in a highly charged trial which has shined a fresh light on the judicial system\u2019s handling of sexual assault cases.</p> <p>Rose, 28, and two friends, Randall Hampton and Ryan Allen, are accused of raping Doe while she was intoxicated in her LA apartment in the early hours of 27 August 2013. The defendants admit taking turns having sex with her but say it was consensual.</p> <p>America\u2019s latest collision of celebrity and alleged sexual assault is playing out in civil litigation, not criminal trial. If the defendants lose they will be ordered to pay damages but not go to jail or have a criminal conviction. The LAPD\u2019s criminal investigation remains open, however, and Hernandez was among the officers monitoring the trial for evidence that could trigger a criminal prosecution.</p> <p>The LAPD said she was one of two detectives assigned to the Rose case. \u201cAt this point there is no indication that her casework had any connection to her death,\u201d a statement said. \u201cThe Rose investigation will continue unimpeded.\u201d</p> <p>Law enforcement sources <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-lapd-employee-dead-whittier-20161012-snap-story.html\">told the Los Angeles Times</a> the house where Hernandez was found belonged to a relative, and that property records showed it registered to a retired LAPD lieutenant.</p> <p>Hernandez\u2019s involvement in the Rose case became publicly known last month when Doe\u2019s lawyers cited her in an<a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-rose-rape-case-20160926-snap-story.html\"> attempt to protect Doe\u2019s anonymity. </a> Shielding alleged rape victims\u2019 identities was an \u201can invaluable investigative aid to investigators\u201d, the detective wrote in a letter that lawyers submitted to federal Judge Michael Fitzgerald.</p> <p>However the judge ruled that the anonymity granted to Doe after she filed the lawsuit last year would end when the trial began last week in the interest of openness and of not prejudicing the jury. Her name has been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/oct/05/derrick-rose-rape-trial-accuser-named\">cited in testimony and court documents, </a>but most media outlets have refrained from reporting it.</p> <p>Lawyers for Rose, the youngest player ever to win the NBA\u2019s Most Valuable Player award, asked the judge to dismiss the case because Doe\u2019s legal team had withheld some deleted texts she sent Rose on the night of the alleged rape. </p> <p>Judge Fitzgerald rejected the mistrial motion on Wednesday but instructed the jury of six women and two men to draw an adverse inference because of the lapse. \u201cPlaintiff failed in her legal obligation to respond fully to the lawful discovery demands. These texts could be viewed by the jury as being helpful to the defense. They are at a minimum consistent with the defense\u2019s theory of this action.\u201d</p> <p>Doe and Rose had dated on and off for two years before the alleged assault. On the night of 26 August 2013 Doe went with a female friend to Rose\u2019s Beverly Hills home. She became inebriated and after midnight took a taxi back to her apartment. Rose, Hampton and Allen arrived there a short time later, had intercourse with her and left. The case hinges on whether she gave consent.</p> <p>In one of the deleted texts, sent at 1.36am after Doe left Rose\u2019s home and before he arrived at her apartment, she told Rose her friend was angry he had not had sex with her. \u201cShe was mad at me babe.

The third defendant, Allen, was due to testify later on Wednesday.</p> <p>Last week Doe testified that she when she got home she vomited, passed out on her bed and drifted in and out of consciousness while the three men had sex with her. She said she woke with her dress around her neck, lubricant on her legs, a burning sensation between her legs and condoms around the bed.</p>",

  "<p>After grinding grain since 1897, Sydney\u2019s Crago Flour Mill finally cranked to a halt in the mid 80s. Over the years, this handsome industrial Newtown site became rundown, a dusty labyrinth of rooms sprawled over four buildings.</p> <p>Given the job in 2008 of transforming the mill into 47 strata studios, architects Allen Jack+Cottier (AJ+C) made a strategic decision.

Internal layers were removed to allow natural light into the dim insides; an insulated sandwich roof system (in which a metal outer panel is glued to an inner core of foam)<strong> </strong>was added to the historic roof, reducing heat transfer and adding insulation;<strong> </strong>carpets created from recycled PET plastic bottles were laid down;<strong> </strong>and solar panels were installed for heating water and rainwater is collected for landscaping.</p> <p>The Green Building Council of Australia (GBCA) encourages the reuse and retrofitting of existing buildings. \u201cAround 80,000 buildings in Australia have fallen through the \u2018green gap\u2019 and are missing out on retrofit opportunities that would improve their energy productivity, resilience and sustainability,\u201d says chief executive Romilly Madew.

For example, before the advent of airconditioning in the 1960s, structures made do with passive environmental control from cross-ventilation windows to shutters, awnings and masonry that helped keep out the sun.

In 2013 the facade was retained amid a $280m revamp that added<strong tabindex=\"-1\"> </strong>office and retail space set in a newly built nine-storey internal glass atrium.</p> <p>Now called 171 Collins Street, the atrium works like a kaleidoscope, providing ample natural light. Efficiency features for the six star Green Star-rated structure include floor to ceiling double glazing, a dedicated waste storage area for recycling, an advanced rainwater and grey water reuse system, LED and T5 fluorescent lighting, and fritted insulating glass to maximise solar insulation. A 315kW natural gas co-generation generator has also been set up to transform wasted heat into an energy source, as well as cutting carbon dioxide emissions by up to two-thirds.</p> <p>Knight Frank\u2019s senior facilities and engineering manager CJ Harshana Wijewardane says that the six-star rating was achieved through \u201cmethodically fine-tuning existing infrastructure\u201d while installing new technologies.</p> <p>Most important was the co-generation system, which operating in parallel with the grid supply is not only the base source of electricity for the office tower but also provides heating for the building and for hot water. </p> <p>Despite all this, the Mayfair building retains a richness and decadence<strong>, </strong>says Kristen Whittle of Bates Smart architects.

  "<p>After England ended Bangladesh\u2019s run of six home one-day international series victories with a four-wicket win in Chittagong the captain, Jos Buttler, said \u201cit should not be underestimated what we have achieved here\u201d.</p> <p>Particularly in white-ball cricket Bangladesh are not the flaccid force of old: they have beaten South Africa, Pakistan and India at home since the last World Cup where, as in 2011, they memorably defeated England. They take a place in England\u2019s group at the Champions Trophy next year at the expense of West Indies.</p> <p>As the man of the series, Ben Stokes, said: \u201cReally good teams have come out here and lost, which proves where we are heading as a team.\u201d</p> <p>England\u2019s task was made tougher by the absence of Alex Hales and the regular captain, Eoin Morgan, both at home for security reasons, and Joe Root, who was rested before a gruelling winter which includes seven Tests before Christmas.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/oct/12/england-bangladesh-third-odi-match-report\">England beat Bangladesh by four wickets to win third ODI and series</a> </p> </aside>  <p>On top of England\u2019s inexperience and the quality of the opposition (and their wildly partisan crowds and alien pitches), the games in Dhaka were played in searing conditions, the factor Stokes, who saw England home with an unbeaten 47 to go with his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/oct/07/england-jake-ball-debut-bangladesh-match-report\" title=\"\">maiden ODI century in the opening game</a>, described as \u201cthe biggest challenge out here\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cIt is hugely satisfying,\u201d Buttler said. \u201cIt should not be underestimated what we have achieved here. Physically it\u2019s been a tough tour for us and mentally as well, with everything that\u2019s gone on before, and then to come here \u2013 a pretty young and inexperienced team \u2013 to win in Bangladesh, who have had success in their recent series, I thought we played really well, but with room for improvement as well. It\u2019s great to learn when you\u2019re winning, and good teams win games when they are not at their best. Moving forward, this tour will stand us in great stead.\u201d</p> <p>Of his first tour as captain \u2013 which has taken on an extra diplomatic role given the heavy security detail \u2013 Buttler said: \u201cI&#xa0;have enjoyed the challenge. It\u2019s been different, a lot more emotional. I was struggling to watch that at the end. I would have much preferred to be in the middle when you feel you have more control but I\u2019ve enjoyed the challenge. I\u2019ve learnt as I\u2019ve gone on.\u201d</p> <p>While Morgan and Hales are set to retain their positions for the ODI series in India in January, two of England\u2019s young pretenders, Sam Billings (recalled and promoted to open because of an injury to Jason Roy\u2019s right quad) and 21-year-old Ben Duckett, played vital, mature innings as 278 was reached with 13 balls to spare, an aspect Buttler said he was \u201chugely satisfied with\u201d. Roy\u2019s injury meant England were missing their entire first-choice top four.</p> <p>\u201cSam has been around the group for a long time and has been very unlucky to not play more,\u201d Buttler said. \u201cAsking him to open the innings today, I thought he played fantastically well.\u201d</p> <p>\u201c[James] Vince and Billings gave us that good start which gave us the confidence to play all our natural games out there,\u201d Stokes said. \u201cBen Duckett, too \u2013 to come in a high-pressure situation to carry on the way the way he did in the first game was a real credit to him.\u201d</p> <p>While the decider largely passed without aggro, Buttler and Stokes said the spice that dominated the second ODI \u2013 which England lost by 34 runs \u2013 made the victory even sweeter.</p> <p>Asked if he felt England had the last laugh, after the Bangladesh captain, Mashrafe Mortaza, and Sabbir Rahman had been fined for giving Buttler a send-off, England\u2019s captain said: \u201cIt does a bit. It\u2019s definitely nice to win, especially after what happened. It does feel pretty sweet to win the series. It was nice to shake their hands at the end and to look a few in the eye and say \u2018well played\u2019.\u201d</p>",

  "<p>Coming from AMC, the Don Draper channel, <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.amc.com/shows/halt-and-catch-fire\">Halt and Catch Fire</a> was launched to an unreasonable assumption that the 80s-set tech drama would be <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/mad-men-tv-series\">Mad Men</a> with computers. When it immediately became clear that this wouldn\u2019t be the case, media attention evaporated, in effect punishing the show for not being something it had never been never intended to be. But for those of us who have stuck with it, the show has delivered. Totally original, it isn\u2019t the next anything \u2013 it\u2019s the first and last Halt and Catch Fire.</p> <p>After a second season that put the programmer Cameron and the engineer Donna\u2019s business relationship to the fore \u2013 a partnership that saw the more nuts-and-bolts Donna\u2019s self-worth slowly diminish as the more creative, intuitive genius Cameron was showered with praise and credit \u2013 the third saw the show hit that sweet spot where all the groundwork laid in establishing the characters in previous episodes paid off. </p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpimTVRJcv8\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/tpimTVRJcv8?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>The core players were split up, then mixed and matched, as Cameron avoided Donna\u2019s attempts to expand their fledgling gaming and social network Mutiny, preferring it to evolve incrementally to preserve its perfection; meanwhile, the brilliant computer engineer Gordon sequestered himself under the stairs with his ham radio, sending out messages to ether on his obsolete device. Joe, the show\u2019s (sort-of) Steve Jobs-alike, stayed away for the most part, searching for the next big thing with disastrous, fatal consequences for his new acolyte Ryan. The cast, surely one of TV\u2019s finest ensembles, delivered the drama with deft economy. </p> <p>Some of the best acting was wordless, such as Cameron\u2019s disintegration after being ousted from Mutiny, stubbornly forcing the board to move against her with their plans to make the company go public; or Donna and Gordon\u2019s marriage falling apart. This collapse started small, with Donna\u2019s casual admission that she hated their camping trips, memories of which Gordon cherished. Soon we saw the distance between them grow to the point where they could share a home but barely converse.</p> <p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/annabethgish?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\">Annabeth Gish</a> (The X-Files, The West Wing) was a fine addition to the cast as Diane Gould, the rich and headstrong businesswoman who buys into Mutiny and provides some nicely grown-up romance with Bos, Mutiny\u2019s mentor and Cameron\u2019s unacknowledged father figure. Gish is the sort of talent this high-quality show easily attracts.

Cameron losing control of Mutiny. Ryan\u2019s suicide after he bought into Joe\u2019s rebellious talk wholesale and released the source code to the anti-virus software, expecting to be hailed a hero but ending up a liability wanted by the feds. Every week a sock in the jaw that made you want to come back for more. </p> <p>The four-year time jump for the final two episodes felt natural, even though the show has largely been defined by its 80s setting. The 90s were heralded with signifiers such as video dating, foodie bore \u201cGordo\u201d and Donna\u2019s now totally grungified surly teen daughter, Joanie, as well as a scene at the convention reminding us how much fun it is to dance to the Pixies\u2019 Velouria, a song that seems to have improved with age.</p> <p>Much had changed. Cameron had spent the time in Tokyo with Tom, the husband she married in secret then followed abroad, working on four installments of the unwinnable Space Bike, her computer game for Atari that girls love and boys seek to improve \u2013 the pushy fan offering her a bit of unsolicited \u201cmansprogramming\u201d at her convention signing table. Donna and Gordon had divorced, Donna going corporate, becoming a partner at Diane\u2019s firm and reverting to her maiden name of Emmerson in order to take up more of the precious real estate on the company\u2019s letterheads and signage. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"22013659094304958482c22fccacc20b7c374627\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/22013659094304958482c22fccacc20b7c374627/0_0_4240_2832/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Scoot McNair as Gordon Clark: sending out messages to ether on his obsolete device\" width=\"1000\" height=\"668\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Scoot McNair as Gordon Clark: sending out messages to ether on his obsolete device.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tina Rowden/AMC</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Gordon\u2019s still managing his incurable medical condition, his brain slowly deteriorating thanks to exposure to the toxic chemicals his tech work exposed him to, and seemingly taking a relaxed approach to his successful business. Joe is running a consultancy business from home, a job that appears to consist of him repeatedly saying \u201cno\u201d to clients on his cutting-edge phone headset. Bos is retired, good for him but unfortunate for the finale as he is sidelined repairing his boat; his one scene with Cameron still managed to shine and had one of the night\u2019s few, brief moments of genuine warmth. Another loss was the Mutiny team, the unruly army of Nerf gun-wielding programmers and coders who often provided a geek chorus to the main drama. </p> <p>It ended, bravely, with a bottle episode, cutting away all distractions by placing the core players in the derelict Mutiny warehouse office. It delivered some classic Halt And Catch Fire moves, tech arguments that were really about personal issues, heavy metaphors made light by the skilled performances.</p> <p>It turns out Donna might have been the show\u2019s villain, with Kerry Bish\u00e9\u2019s considerable charm and acting chops providing a smokescreen. Looking back, Donna has never managed to get ahead without ruining things for someone else, another example of how the show manages to hide things in plain sight \u2013 let\u2019s not forget Cameron was pushed out of the company she led, a company called ... Mutiny. That\u2019s two years of signposting an event that was still a huge shock when it happened \u2013 it\u2019s hard to think of another show getting away with that. Then there was Joe and Tom butting heads over HTML and HTTP when they were clearly arguing about Cameron. Or having them all discuss how the various internet firms can\u2019t work with each other, a blatant metaphor for the characters themselves. </p> <p>This 10-episode run was written to be the last; the season finale was supposed to be the end of the entire story. It could easily have been a satisfactory capper to things, with the trio of Cameron, Joe and Gordon all huddled around a terminal, exploring the endless possibilities of a new startup. Leaving them at a stage where their new business is unpolluted and perfect would have been a deserved kindness. But fate \u2013 or rather AMC \u2013 had other plans and a last-minute reprieve came just last week when a fourth and final season was ordered. AMC knows the show is something special; so do we. So why doesn\u2019t everyone else?</p>",

So there\u2019s a political significance to this, which may determine the outcome.</p> <p>[Background: <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-06-29/hollande-says-brexit-to-hurt-city-of-london-in-clearing-warning\">French president Francois Hollande said in June that the UK won\u2019t be able to keep its euro clearing business after Brexit</a>].</p> <p><strong>But on the technical issue -- euro clearing relates to the process by which banks clear complex derivative contracts priced in euros.</strong></p> <p>He explains that after the 2008 financial crisis, regulators insisted that derivatives contracts are cleared centrally, so that they could see the state of play, and if any firms are getting in trouble.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>You avoid what happened in the financial crisis, where as the prices of assets move quickly, counter-parties make margin calls on other counter-parties, and the situation deteriorates quickly.</p> </blockquote> <p>Cunliffe says he was at the G20 meeting in Pittsburg when regulators decided to do this, and it was the right thing. </p> <p><strong>But it needs central clearing, so you can net the risks.</strong><br></p> <p>In other words, financial firms can \u2018net\u2019 off their margin calls, balancing contracts where are up, or down, and only post the balance. That reduces the stress in the system, meaning firms won\u2019t have to post as much capital or buy as much insurance.</p> <p>Cunliffe then, politely, rubbishes the idea that derivative contracts need to be cleared in the jurisdiction of the currency that they are issued in.</p> <p>Currently, London clears contracts priced in euros, dollars, and yen (for example).</p> <p>It you make multi-currency infrastructure impossible, then the cost of clearing derivatives will go up.</p> <p>And fragmenting the system could create financial stability risks, if the current set-up in London is replaced by several smaller operations.</p> <p>He says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I can understand the politics around this, but we\u2019re taking technically about multi-currency infrastructure.</p> <p>If we\u2019re talking about going to a world where you have to clear in the jurisdiction of issue, then the costs are going to go up in a pretty big way.</p> </blockquote> <p><em>Q: So are you saying that it\u2019s unlikely that euro clearing will move out of London to the EU, if it was a rational decision?</em></p> <p>I think the system works well now, Cunliffe replies diplomatically.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-10-12T10:24:49.798Z\">at 11.24am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57fe04bde4b01d9dd2c90200\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-12T09:50:41.496Z\">10.50am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Cunliffe: City jobs could move to New York after Brexit</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"20682ee343a0b11cffe65f464b5e38a258851ed1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/20682ee343a0b11cffe65f464b5e38a258851ed1/0_0_6000_4000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Wall Street, in New York.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Wall Street, in New York.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mark Lennihan/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>City jobs are more likely to move to New York than to Europe, if Britain loses access to the single market, Sir Jon Cunliffe argues.</strong><br></p> <p>The Bank of England\u2019s deputy governor tells the House of Lords committee that it\u2019s not plausible that London banks would move their operations to other European capitals.</p> <p>The current system is simply too complex, and reliant on other industries, so can\u2019t simply be copied.:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I can\u2019t see London\u2019s financial ecosystem being replicated elsewhere in the foreseeable future, in one place in the European Union.</p> <p>It takes an awful lot of time, human capital, it\u2019s based around the interaction of financial services and other services.</p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p>The idea that this ecosystem can be transplanted to Europe in the foreseeable future is highly unlikely.</p> </blockquote> <p>Cunliffe then cites research showing that a quarter of the value of a \u2018transaction chain\u2019 comes from other financial firms who take part in the transaction, and another quarter comes from non-financial companies such as lawyer.</p> <p>You need those things to be able to work together seamlessly.</p> <p><strong>And in New York, that already happens.

It has been a rather odd occasion - not a debate about Brexit, but a debate about how parliament debates Brexit - but given that we now live in world where the pound can rally following the publication of government amendments to opposition day motions (see <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/oct/12/pmqs-may-corbyn-brexit-debate-claims-real-victory-after-may-offers-brexit-debate-concession-politics-live?page=with:block-57fe14dce4b01d9dd2c90266#block-57fe14dce4b01d9dd2c90266\">11.50am)</a>, these procedural wrangles matter.</p> <ul> <li><strong>MPs are set to approve a motion with cross-party support saying the Commons must have a \u201cfull and transparent\u201d debate on the government\u2019s plans for Brexit before article 50 is invoked, but ministers are refusing to commit themselves to giving parliament an actual vote on the matter. </strong><strong>Theresa May</strong> made this clear at PMQs (see <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/oct/12/pmqs-may-corbyn-brexit-debate-claims-real-victory-after-may-offers-brexit-debate-concession-politics-live?page=with:block-57fe1fe8e4b03b22b4fb28b2#block-57fe1fe8e4b03b22b4fb28b2\">12.36pm)</a> and<strong> David Davis</strong>, the Brexit secretary, would not promise a substantive vote either in his speech at the start of the debate. It may well be the case that eventually MPs do get a vote, but any vote on a substantive motion would constrain the government, and also allow the possibility of Tory MPs rebelling with Labour, and May seems determined to resist it if at all possible. In his impressive debut as shadow Brexit secretary<strong> Sir Keir Starmer</strong> confimed that Labour was not explicitly demanding a vote in its motion because it wanted to maximise the chances of MPs voting for it tonight. (See <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/oct/12/pmqs-may-corbyn-brexit-debate-claims-real-victory-after-may-offers-brexit-debate-concession-politics-live?page=with:block-57fe2e99e4b03b22b4fb2910#block-57fe2e99e4b03b22b4fb2910\">1.37pm.)</a></li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>Davis has played down suggestions that the government will publish a white paper or a green paper on Brexit. </strong>When it was put to him that a fellow minister, George Eustice, said a Brexit white paper was likely to be published, Davis dismissed the idea. Later he seemed to hint that one could be published.</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I should also tell the House ... I have asked the chief whip to ensure we have a series of debates so that the House can air its views. And it would be again very surprising if we had those debates without presenting to the House something for them to debate.</p> </blockquote> <p>But a source in the department for Brexit said that Davis was not intending to suggest that policy papers would be published before the debates. Davis was just referring to the fact that ministers would keep MPs updated, the source said.</p> <ul> <li><strong>A Conservative former minister has accused the government of pursuing a Brexit policy driven by ideology, not national interest.</strong> In a question to Davis <strong>Claire Perry, </strong>the former transport minister, said:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I am extremely concerned by what has happened to sterling and what has happened to interest rates since the prime minister\u2019s comments at the conference last week. And I think the problem [David Davis] is not acknowledging is that many people in the country do not think that there is a policy to put the national interest first. They think there is a policy to put people\u2019s narrow ideological interests first. And what we should be setting out is quite clearly how we are going to protect British jobs and businesses and put ideology in the past where it belongs.</p> </blockquote> <p>Davis rejected this claim.</p> <ul> <li><strong>Iain Duncan Smith, the Conservative former work and pensions secretary, has withdrawn a claim he made on Monday that Starmer is a second-rate lawyer.</strong> He said he was being \u201cclumsy\u201d and that his comment was not intended to apply to Starmer, a former director of public prosecutions.</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Can I unreservedly withdraw allegations that I made on Monday, only on the basis that it was clumsy, it was not meant about you, it was meant about advice. I don\u2019t doubt for one moment your capabilities as a lawyer.</p> </blockquote> <p>Starmer said he considered the matter closed.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I\u2019m grateful for that and I can assure you and the House that I wasn\u2019t in the slightest bit concerned. I consider the matter closed.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>Davis refused to confirm that powers over fishing and agriculture currently exercised by Brussels would currently devolve to the Scottish parliament. </strong>These were matters that would have to be discussed with Edinburgh, he said. <strong>Alex Salmond</strong>, the former Scottish first minister, said that under current law these matters would automatically get devolved to Scotland, regardless of what Davis said, unless the devolution arrangements were changed. He told Davis:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Agriculture and fisheries are not reserved, therefore they are devolved. Unless the government intends to change that position it\u2019ll be automatic that agriculture and fisheries powers go to the Scottish government.</p> </blockquote> <p>Davis replied:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>This is an area where we have not addressed or talked to the devolved administration at all yet.

The very fact that Corbyn focused on Brexit was striking, because since the referendum (and for some time before) he has generally avoided the topic. But, as usual, he asked strong questions but failed to follow them up. (In tennis terms, he has an adequate serve, but no return.) He also failed to press May on the one question that is really topical today; in the light of her U-turn last night on a Brexit debate, can she now commit to giving MPs a vote on a substantive motion? May responded competently, but not brilliantly, to Corbyn\u2019s questions, and interestingly she avoided some of the gratuitous Labour-bashing that has marred some of her earlier PMQs, although she did finish with a neat point about Labour getting the same answer when they ask a question for a second time.

The jobs and income of people are at stake. May says she will not give a running commentary.

Debates like this do not force MPs to decide between two positions. Having a debate on a substantive motion would allow, for example, those MPs who want the UK to stay in the single market to table an amendment saying this should be a top priority.</p> <p>Phillips told the Daily Politics he would like to see a motion saying, for example, that the UK should remain in the single market and that the UK should get control of its borders. Neil said these two demands were irreconcilable, but Phillips did not accept that.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57fe10f4e4b03b22b4fb284b\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-12T10:32:09.836Z\">11.32am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Sir Keir Starmer</strong>, the shadow Brexit secretary, will be opening the debate this afternoon for Labour. <strong>David Davis</strong>, the Brexit secretary, will respond.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57fe0cc2e4b05d915e424163\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-12T10:19:59.771Z\">11.19am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Modern-day slaves are being failed by \u201csubstandard\u201d crime recording which risks allowing perpetrators to offend with impunity, according to the UK\u2019s anti-slavery commissioner, the Press Association reports.

In it they said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>If you are able to provide satisfactory answers to all these questions, just one per day from tomorrow until 31 March next year, it might give some confidence that the government is entering the Article 50 negotiations with a clear plan.</p> <p>If not, it will reinforce the sense that the government is instead blundering into this process without a clear endgame in mind, repeating exactly the same mistake that the previous Prime Minister made with his \u2018renegotiation\u2019 of Britain\u2019s EU membership last year: working to an artificial, self-imposed timetable; with a flawed Plan A of what he wanted to achieve; and no Plan B whatsoever.</p> <p>Given you have consistently spoken up throughout your career in a highly principled way about the importance of Parliamentary sovereignty, we hope you will reflect again on the decision to deny the country\u2019s elected representatives the opportunity to debate and vote on the Government\u2019s plan for Brexit before Article 50 is triggered.</p> </blockquote> <p>In response to the letter a Conservative spokesperson said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We are aiming to deliver the right deal for the United Kingdom and return control over all the decisions that affect people\u2019s lives to the sovereign institutions of this country.</p> <p>That\u2019s what people voted for on June 23.

In reality, it it probably more a matter of establishing a temporary, tactical advantage, but an opposition is entitled to boast about its gains whenever it gets them.</p> <p>The key point is that Theresa May has compromised to avoid the risk of a Tory revolt over giving the Commons a say on Brexit.</p> <p>It\u2019s an opposition day in the Commons (meaning Labour gets the choose the motion for debate) and the party decided to get MPs to vote on whether the Commons should be consulted on the government\u2019s Brexit negotiating strategy. Here is the motion that it has tabled, which is also backed by the Lib Dems.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>That this House recognises that leaving the EU is the defining issue facing the UK; believes that there should be a full and transparent debate on the Government\u2019s plan for leaving the EU; and calls on the Prime Minister to ensure that this House is able properly to scrutinise that plan for leaving the EU before Article 50 is invoked.</p> </blockquote> <p>Some Tory MPs also feel strongly that the Commons must have a say over Brexit (for reasons set out in the chamber on Monday) and, if there were a straightforward yes/no vote on whether the Commons should be consulted, Tory rebels could unite with the opposition to defeat the government. Theresa May wants to ensure the government has the final say.</p> <p>But May is not asking Tory MPs to reject the Labour motion outright (which is what normally happens when MPs debate an opposition day motion). Instead the government has tabled an amendment saying what Labour proposes is fine, so long as the government\u2019s negotiating position is maintained. The amendment reads:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>At end add \u2018; and believes that the process should be undertaken in such a way that respects the decision of the people of the UK when they voted to leave the EU on 23 June and does not undermine the negotiating position of the government as negotiations are entered into which will take place after article 50 has been triggered.\u2019.</p> </blockquote> <p>Tory MPs will be asked to vote for this amendment, before the Commons votes on the main motions. Tory MPs who feel very strongly about parliamentary scrutiny, the \u201crebels\u201d <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/11/we-voted-brexit-keep-parliament-sovereign-wont-be-gagged\">like Stephen Phillips</a>, may choose not to back the amendment, on the grounds that it is an attempt to neuter the demand for scrutiny, but that that won\u2019t look like much of a rebellion. And then the motion as a whole will get passed, probably with the amendment attached.<br></p> <p>That means effectively that May has conceded that there must be a \u201cfull and transparent debate\u201d in the Commons on the government\u2019s Brexit plan, before article 50 is invoked. <strong>Sir Keir Starmer</strong>, the shadow Brexit secretary, said last night this was \u201ca real victory for \u201cparliament and will help ensure there is proper democratic grip of the Brexit process.\u201d</p> <p>But the Labour motion mentions a debate but not a vote. On the Today programme <strong>Emily Thornberry</strong>, the shadow foreign secretary, said that it implied a vote. But ministers will be able to say that they have not agreed to let the Commons vote on, for example, whether remaining a member of the single market must be a priority. If Labour could get May to concede that, then that really would count as a huge victory.</p> <p>I will be covering this issue, and the debate, in full during the day.</p> <p>Here is the agenda.<br></p> <p><em>9am:</em> Justine Greening, the education secretary, gives a speech to the Fawcett Society gender pay conference.</p> <p><em>9.30am:</em> Jeremy Corbyn, Tim Farron, the Lib Dem leader, Sir Patrick McLoughlin, the Conservative chairman, and Angus Robertson, the SNP leader at Westminster, give evidence to the Commons women and equalities committee on women in the Commons after the 2020 election.</p> <p><em>9.30am:</em> Chris Grayling, the transport secretary, gives a speech on HS2.</p> <p><em>10am:</em> Sir Jon Cunliffe, the Bank of England deputy governor, gives evidence to a Lords committee on Brexit. </p> <p><em>10.30am: </em>Senior police figures, including Stephen Rodhouse, deputy assistant commissioner at the Metropolitan police, give evidence to a Lords committee on Brexit.</p> <p><em>12pm:</em> Theresa May faces Corbyn at PMQs.</p> <p><em>12.30pm:</em> MPs begin a debate on parliamentary scrutiny of the Brexit process.</p> <p>I will be mostly focusing on Brexit today but, as usual, I will be covering the breaking political news as it happens.</p> <p>If you want to follow me or contact me on Twitter, I\u2019m on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AndrewSparrow\">@AndrewSparrow.</a></p> <p>I try to monitor the comments BTL but normally I find it impossible to read them all.

But they were already at war with Saddam Hussein, having just defeated him in Kuwait. Saddam was on his own internationally, despised and isolated. He had no support from Russia or any Arab allies. The last thing he wanted was to confront the US any further. Enforcing a no-fly zone (even though it had no clear UN security council authorisation) involved no risk to the US or UK. Saddam made little effort to resist and not one of their manned aircraft was shot down.</p> <p>Today\u2019s situation in Syria is different. The Syrian air force is fully engaged and will not back down in its campaign to defeat its enemies in Aleppo. After three years of military stalemate, Bashar al-Assad feels he has regained the upper hand and is determined to retake his country\u2019s largest city.</p> <p>More importantly, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/12/russia-boris-johnson-syria-aleppo-war-crime-russophobic-hysteria\" title=\"\">the Russians are also active in the air</a>. Imposing a no-fly zone unilaterally (it would never gain a security council mandate) would be a declaration of war on Russia as well as on Assad. The dangers are obvious. It is not just a question of a clash between western and Russian planes by accident. That might be the only risk if it was assumed the Russians would meekly leave the skies free. Why would they? They are not going to be deterred from a bombing campaign that appears to be helping Assad\u2019s ground forces advance. For the west to confront them risks an incalculably serious war.</p> <p>Many on the jihadi side would like nothing more than to see the two Satans \u2013 the west and Russia \u2013 destroying each other in a hot war. But for Britain and the US it is madness. Hillary Clinton seemed to recognise that in a speech to corporate donors, according to the latest Wikileaks release. \u201cAll of a sudden this intervention that people talk about so glibly becomes an American and Nato involvement where you take [out] a lot of civilians\u201d, she said.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The second option is for Syrian government forces to retake the whole city</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>There are only three sensible ways to save Aleppo\u2019s people. One is the voluntary departure of the jihadis who, in the words of UN envoy <a href=\"http://www.middleeasteye.net/columns/wrong-un-s-syria-envoy-offer-aleppo-18894725\" title=\"\">Staffan de Mistura</a>, are holding civilians hostage. One could go further and say they are keeping eastern Aleppo\u2019s civilians as human shields. Why, for example, have most people not left already, given the intensity of Russian bombing: is it that the jihadis are blocking people\u2019s escape? Syria is also mired in a propaganda war, and in the heart-rending images that the rebels put out on social media about life and death in Aleppo, the seamier side of the armed groups\u2019 control is suppressed.</p> <p>Hundreds of civilians recently left the <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-mideast-crisis-syria-daraya-idUSKCN1111FE?il=0\" title=\"\">besieged Damascus suburb of Daraya</a> after the rebels gave in, with no reprisals from Assad forces. Gunmen were even allowed to keep their weapons and were taken by buses to rebel-held areas in the north.</p> <p>The second option is for Syrian government forces to retake the whole city, just as Iraqi forces retook jihadi-held <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/dec/28/iraq-declares-ramadi-liberated-from-islamic-state\" title=\"\">Ramadi</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/30/iraqi-forces-enter-fallujah-in-attempt-to-drive-out-islamic-state\" title=\"\">Falluja</a> in recent months. Iraqi barrel bombs and US airstrikes had left three-quarters of those cities in ruins, but civilians got the chance to rebuild their lives.</p> <p>The concept of an Assad victory will stick in the throats of hundreds of thousands of Syrians who have lost so much in the fight against him. But if the secular multicultural tolerance of pre-war Syria is to be restored, it is better to deny victory to the Sunni extremists who pose the main opposition to Assad, whether it is Islamic State, the al-Qaida-linked<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/28/al-qaida-syria-nusra-split-terror-network\" title=\"\"> Jabhat al-Nusra</a> or similar groups.</p> <p>The third option is a ceasefire. Last month\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/10/syria-ceasefire-deal-tentative-negotiate-kerry-lavrov-us-russia\" title=\"\">Russian-US agreement</a> provided for the superpowers to separate the al-Nusra fighters from those Syrian Islamists prepared to negotiate with Assad\u2019s representatives in Geneva for a coalition government.</p> <p>The ceasefire never took hold because the Islamists refused to split. Al-Nusra understandably did not want to be isolated and left vulnerable to a joint US-Russian air campaign. So they used their dominance among the Aleppo fighters to press the other groups to stick with them. For their part, the non-Nusra fighters feared an alliance between the Americans, the Russians and Assad\u2019s army.</p> <p>Having failed once, for the Russians and Americans to broker a new ceasefire is a tall order. The other options are equally difficult. But at least they tend towards de-escalation. Proposing a no-fly zone not only risks greater catastrophe for the people of Aleppo. It threatens to engulf us all.</p>",
  "<p>Jonathan Freedland is right that the referendum result has to be honoured (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/07/marching-mad-brexit-someone-speak-48-per-cent\" title=\"\">Who speaks for the 48% as we lurch to extreme Brexit?</a>, 8 October). That does not mean, however, that it is sacrosanct, any more than the result of a general election. Those who argue that it is undemocratic to seek its reversal if circumstances have changed ignore the fact that it is an essential part of democracy that no decision should ever be irreversible.</p> <p>As Freedland states, leavers did not vote for the most extreme rupture of our relations with the EU that will cause profound damage to our economy. But we are now heading inexorably towards a hard Brexit, since the government has made immigration control of our borders its top priority, which is incompatible with staying in the single market or the customs union.</p> <p>When this realisation sinks in \u2013 the decline in the value of the pound shows it is already happening \u2013 domestic and foreign investment will decline, a flood of companies will emigrate, London will probably cease to be the financial centre of the EU and we are likely to face a severe, self-inflicted Brexit recession. In time that is likely to cause a major change in public opinion, as many voters for leave will feel they were conned. This change will fully justify a rerun of the referendum, after the conclusion of the negotiations, before our departure becomes inevitable.</p> <p>It is widely assumed that once we trigger article 50 and announce our intention to leave, this sets in motion an irreversible process. However, this assumption does not appear to be legally correct. In <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b9fc30c8-6edb-11e6-a0c9-1365ce54b926\" title=\"\">an article for the Financial Times</a>, Jean-Claude Piris, former director general of the legal service of the Council of the European Union, has pointed out that invoking article 50 and declaring \u201can intention\u201d to leave is a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b9fc30c8-6edb-11e6-a0c9-1365ce54b926\" title=\"\">\u201cunilateral act that does not depend on what other members think or do\u201d</a> and that \u201cIn law, the word \u2018intention\u2019 cannot be interpreted as a final and irreversible decision\u201d. Nothing in article 50, he wrote, would prevent the UK, in conformity with its constitutional requirements, from withdrawing its unilaterally declared \u201cintention\u201d.</p> <p>Those who voted remain are therefore perfectly entitled, legally and democratically, to do everything possible to avoid a disastrous future for this country.

Yet scrutiny, challenge and debate are not optional extras in a democracy, they are the very essence. It is beyond ironic that those who argued so vehemently for parliamentary sovereignty should resort to the royal prerogative and so deny the very democracy they claim to have fought for. <br><strong>Roy Boffy</strong><br><em>Sutton Coldfield</em></p> <p>\u2022 Just suppose that the referendum had produced exactly the opposite result, with just over half of those who voted choosing to stay in the EU.

Brexit will inevitably involve the repeal of the European Communities Act. Only parliament can repeal an act of parliament.

  "<p>A new analysis has found racial disparities in the police use of force across different Austin neighborhoods, even when controlling for neighborhood crime rates and income levels.<br></p> <p>The new study, which used data released as part of a White House initiative launched last year, finds that the strongest predictor of the number of police use of force incidents in different neighborhoods is the crime rates in those neighborhoods.</p> <p>But even controlling for crime rates, income and education levels, and rates of home ownership, black and Hispanic neighborhoods in the Texas city still see a slightly higher number of use of force incidents, the new analysis found. Every 1% increase in the proportion of black residents in a neighborhood led to a 2.6% increase in use of force incidents, according to the analysis.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2015/jun/01/the-counted-police-killings-us-database\">The Counted: people killed by police in the United States \u2013 interactive</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In a highly segregated city such as Austin, that increase actually looks much larger when you apply it to the neighborhood level. Virtually all the neighborhoods on the city\u2019s west side are less than 5% black, while many on the east side are closer to 60% black. Using the report\u2019s findings, that could mean an increase in use of force of more than 140% from a typical white neighborhood to a typical black one after controlling for other variables. The use of force incidents measured included anything from use of a closed fist through use of batons, pepper spray and tasers, all the way to deadly force.</p> <p>The new results line up with previous studies that have found clear racial disparities in police use of force. The analysis does not look specifically at racial disparities in fatal use of force, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/26/black-men-minorities-killed-police-encounters-study\">the most controversial area of research.</a></p> <p>\u201cWhat it tells me is that we still have more work to do,\u201d said Art Acevedo, Austin\u2019s police chief of nearly a decade. \u201cWe have to continue to work in terms of our training on implicit and explicit bias for our department.\u201d</p> <p>But he said he believed that releasing the findings would help continue to build trust with the community, and that they would help the department improve in the long run. </p> <p>\u201cYou can be an ostrich as a leader, and bury your head in the sand, or you can be forward-thinking and be scanning the environment constantly for threats or for opportunities to do better,\u201d Acevedo said.</p> <p>Austin is the first city in the country to go public with this kind of in-depth analysis of use of force disparities, a step that the White House, researchers, and the city\u2019s police chief say they hope other departments will follow.</p> <p>\u201cI can\u2019t say enough about Chief Acevedo\u2019s willingness to put it all out there,\u201d said Roy Austin, a White House domestic policy adviser focused on urban affairs, justice and opportunity. \u201cWe need more chiefs to step up like Chief Acevedo has done and say, \u2018I have nothing to hide. Policing belongs to the community and we are going to show the community exactly what we are doing.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>The Austin analysis was conducted independently by researchers from the Center for Policing Equity and the Urban Institute.</p> <p>Black Americans are more likely to be subject to fatal and nonfatal use of police force than white Americans. The Guardian\u2019s long-term investigation on police killings, the Counted, has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2015/jun/01/the-counted-police-killings-us-database\">consistently found that black Americans are more than twice as likely than white Americans to be killed by the police.</a> What\u2019s less clear are the reasons behind this disparity, and what it would take to erase it.</p> <p>Is the disparity purely based on community factors, such as crime levels or poverty? Is it driven by police department policies or individual police officer racial bias? Or does the disparity in use of force stem from dynamics between police and communities \u2013 such as Americans of some races being more likely to flee from the police in confrontations, or police officers responding to greater hostility toward the police in some neighborhoods rather than others?</p> <p>The report argues that \u201cthe truth likely incorporates elements of each of these\u201d, but that only better data and analysis can help reformers be more specific in finding where the fault lines are.</p> <p>Previous studies, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/reality-check/2016/jul/11/study-finds-no-racial-bias-police-shootings-data\">including a Harvard working paper released in July,</a> found racial disparities in non-fatal police use of force, even controlling for a variety of factors \u2013 including police officers\u2019 own descriptions of how compliant citizens were. The Harvard study found, in an in-depth analysis of Houston data, that black Americans were actually less likely, not more likely, than other Americans to be shot by the police, a controversial finding. It\u2019s not clear to what extent the results in Houston or nine other areas the study examined in less depth might be representative of national trends.</p> <p>The racial disparities in Austin\u2019s use of force \u201care not direct evidence of racial prejudice\u201d, the analysts from the Center for Policing Equity and the Urban Institute concluded. But by controlling for community-level factors, the researchers said, they could demonstrate that police factors or factors driven by the police-community relationship must play some role. </p> <p>\u201cOnce again, we can say that crime is not sufficient to explain the racial disparities we see for both black and Latinos in the use of force,\u201d said Phillip Atiba Goff, the lead researcher on the analysis.</p> <p>The new analysis draws from two different initiatives exploring police use of force data: the White House\u2019s Police Data Initiative, launched last year, which encourages departments to post public data about their use of force, and the National Justice Database, a National Science Foundation-funded effort to build a standardized national database about police use of force, which keeps its data private.</p> <p>Austin is the first city in either of these efforts to agree to publicly release an in-depth analysis of its use of force data. Goff said the city-level study was designed to create a standardized model for other departments to analyze and then share their use of force data. Through the National Justice Database, departments can share data and have these analyses made privately available to them. Whether departments choose to release the results of their analyses publicly is up to police leaders, Goff said.</p> <p>\u201cThese are scary questions to ask,\u201d he said. \u201cIf I\u2019m a chief, I don\u2019t know how well my department is doing on these issues. I can reasonably worry, if the analyses reveal something that is disturbing to the community, I\u2019m kicking a hornet\u2019s nest.\u201d</p> <p>At the same time, he said, \u201cYou can\u2019t fix a problem that you don\u2019t know you have.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/dec/31/the-counted-police-killings-2015-young-black-men\">Young black men killed by US police at highest rate in year of 1,134 deaths</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Acevedo, the Austin chief, said: \u201cMy cops will not be surprised by the fact that we\u2019re participating in this. We will talk to them about the fact that there is a use of force disparity, and our next step for us is that we continue to evaluate our training in terms of de-escalation.\u201d</p> <p> The challenge with Austin being the only department so far to release this analysis so far, Acevedo said, was that \u201cthere\u2019s no other points of reference.\u201d </p> <p>It\u2019s not clear how Austin\u2019s neighborhood use of force disparities might compare with other large cities. \u201cAs a profession, we\u2019re only good as the weakest department in the nation,\u201d Acevedo said. \u201cWe\u2019re all a reflection of one another.\u201d</p> <p><strong> </strong>Unlike prior studies, this new report doesn\u2019t rely on the race of the individual citizens involved to draw its conclusions, but rather, looks at the demographics of the neighborhoods where the use of force incidents occurred.

  "<p>By any yardstick the Scottish National party commands the politics of Scotland. As they gather for their annual conference in Glasgow, Nicola Sturgeon\u2019s party can look back on another year of major victories. After sweeping 56 out of 59 Scottish Westminster seats in the 2015 general election, the SNP was re-elected in May for a third term in government in Holyrood. A week ago, its candidate swept Labour aside in <a href=\"http://stv.tv/news/politics/1369242-snp-take-seat-from-labour-in-glasgow-council-by-election/\" title=\"\">a Glasgow council byelection</a>, perhaps foreshadowing wider SNP gains in the 2017 Scottish local elections, where control of Glasgow is the greatest prize. In the opinion polls, the SNP regularly commands the support of about, or&#xa0;just under, half of Scottish voters, as it did in the 2015 and 2016 elections.</p> <p>In these circumstances, it may seem perverse to talk of the SNP having problems. Yet problems there are, though they should not be overstated and Scotland\u2019s struggling other parties would kill to be faced with them. The SNP, after all, lost some ground in the Holyrood contest in May, compared both with its 2011 triumph and with the 2015 Westminster election. It has lost recent council byelections to Labour too (in <a href=\"http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/local-news/labour-gain-seat-snp-shock-8895855\" title=\"\">North Lanarkshire</a> and North Ayrshire, where <a href=\"http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/politics/nicola-sturgeons-dad-loses-election-8614584\" title=\"\">Ms Sturgeon\u2019s father was defeated</a>) as well as winning one. Ms Sturgeon remains popular, but her approval ratings have <a href=\"https://www.ipsos-mori.com/Assets/Docs/Scotland/ipsos-mori-scotland-spom-september-2016-charts.pdf\" title=\"\">fallen significantly</a> (her net approval in Scotland is currently lower than both Theresa May\u2019s and Ruth Davidson\u2019s). And while Kezia Dugdale\u2019s Labour remains in eclipse, both Labour and Ms Davidson\u2019s revived Scottish Tories regularly point to the truth that the SNP talks a more radical game than it actually delivers.</p> <p>The lurking and deeper problem, skilfully highlighted by Willie Rennie, leader of the Scottish Liberal Democrats, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/09/snp-glasgow-byelection-win-shames-labour\" title=\"\">at a local government conference</a> last week is that the SNP\u2019s dominance and culture risks turning Scotland into something akin to a one-party state, in which government is not properly held to account. Scotland has not reached that point yet, and there are plenty of people inside the SNP as well as outside it who are aware of the dangers. But it needs to be held to account, not least by independent media and the BBC.</p> <p>The sharper and more immediate problem for the SNP is how to respond to the UK\u2019s Brexit vote. Ms Sturgeon has never satisfactorily resolved the dilemma of whether to hold a second independence referendum in the wake of Scotland\u2019s vote to remain. If the path to reversing the 2014 referendum was clear, she would go for it. However, Scottish opinion has now reverted to opposition to independence after a brief contrary shift in July. Ms Sturgeon does not want to lose a second vote. But nor does she want everything to be dominated by the issue of whether to hold one. The conference will debate a motion from Edinburgh West on Friday that calls on the SNP \u201cto prepare\u201d for a second referendum while stopping short of actually demanding one.</p> <p>This seems fated to be the SNP\u2019s position. Ms Sturgeon is caught between activists who crave a second vote and her own more cautious instincts. The reality for the SNP, hard though it may be to accept, is that the public remains sceptical about the independence prospectus, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/24/scotland-oil-money-nationalist-dream-nicola-sturgeon-independence\" title=\"\">for good reasons</a>. Ms Sturgeon\u2019s best course is to ease off about a second referendum and to follow the advice of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/04/scotland-gain-greater-independence-brexit-holyrood-told\" title=\"\">her former minister Alex Neil</a>, who argues that the Brexit process provides many opportunities to devolve EU-level powers to Holyrood, including farming, fishing, employment and the environment. What&#xa0;Mr&#xa0;Neil calls \u201cneo-independence\u201d is probably the best on offer right now. <a href=\"https://d3n8a8pro7vhmx.cloudfront.net/thesnp/pages/3923/attachments/original/1476179282/SNP_Winter_Conf.pdf?1476179282\" title=\"\">The conference\u2019s theme of \u201cStronger for Scotland\u201d</a> suggests that Ms Sturgeon agrees, even if she is wary of disappointing her activists by saying so too directly.</p>",
  "<p>The government\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/higher-education-and-research-bill\" title=\"\">higher education bill</a>, trailed as the centrepiece of the pre-Brexit government\u2019s legislative programme for 2016-2017, is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/22/the-guardian-view-on-universities-facing-a-double-whammy\" title=\"\">a flawed piece of work</a>. It undermines universities\u2019 independence, expands the transactional relationship between them and their students, and introduces for the first time profit-making independent universities. All of these innovations threaten Britain\u2019s global reputation for excellence in higher education. But in among the ideologically driven plans there is one welcome proposal. In the name of improving social mobility, there will be more monitoring of students\u2019 socio-economic background. At the moment, a student from an advantaged background is still six times more likely to go to a top university than a student from a disadvantaged one; the latter is more likely to drop out, and less likely to get a good job. Understanding in greater detail which students are applying from which disadvantaged group, and whereabouts in the country they live, should make recruitment more socially just. Maintenance and tuition loans will also be extended to mature and part-time students. Given the ambition of these changes, it is all the more disappointing that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/aug/01/abolition-student-maintenance-grant-poorest-university-loans-tuition-fees\" title=\"\">maintenance grants for the poorest students</a> have been abolished from this year.

  "<p>Theresa May was confused.

For months now she had been used to it being a bit of a rabble and squabbling among itself. Now it was showing signs of getting its act together. Jeremy Corbyn <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/12/jeremy-corbyn-pushes-theresa-may-over-shambolic-tory-brexit\">was asking trickier and more focused questions</a> and the backbenchers were more interested in getting under Tory skins than their leader\u2019s. No one had ever warned her that the opposition might actually oppose and she couldn\u2019t handle it. She felt brittle and unsure; even she wasn\u2019t convinced by her answers.</p> <p>Grumpy David Davis was also confused. And even grumpier than usual. He\u2019d been told the government wouldn\u2019t be giving a running commentary on its Brexit negotiations and here he was being dragged back to the Commons for the second time in three days to explain why he didn\u2019t really have a clue about what he was supposed to be doing and was making it up as he went along. He hadn\u2019t voted for Britain to leave the EU only for parliament to hold him to account. That\u2019s not what he called \u201ctaking back control\u201d.</p> <p>Labour\u2019s shadow Brexit minister, Keir Starmer, tried to make things easy for Grumpy. Scrutinising the government\u2019s Brexit negotiations was not about trying to renege on the result of the referendum; it was about trying to negotiate the best possible outcome for leaving the EU. Hadn\u2019t Grumpy tabled a 10 minute rule bill back in 1999 which questioned the right of the executive to ratify treaty changes without a vote in parliament?</p> <p>\u201cLa la la,\u201d grumped Grumpy. \u201cI\u2019m not listening.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAllow me to put it this way, then,\u201d Starmer continued, helpfully. If Grumpy was going to act like an idiot, he would treat him like one. \u201cThe referendum was a mandate to leave the EU. It wasn\u2019t a mandate on the terms on which we would leave. You can\u2019t build a consensus around a position that you\u2019ve refused to disclose.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnother day, another outing,\u201d said Grumpy when he finally got to have his say. \u201cMy mandate is my mandate. It is the biggest mandate ever. Take back control. I am not a robot. Clunk. Clunk. Whirr.\u201d Grumpy didn\u2019t bother to check his notes. He was still on auto-pilot from last Monday. \u201cThere\u2019s no need for the government to do anything it doesn\u2019t want to. We\u2019ve done quite enough voting. My mandate is my mandate. Control back take. Clunk. Whirr. Plop.\u201d </p> <p>\u201cActually,\u201d Labour\u2019s Jack Dromey interrupted. \u201cA junior minister, George Eustice, has just gone on the radio to say that the government will be putting forward a green paper for parliament to debate. So that rather suggests we will get a vote.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMandate. Back control take. There will be no vote. Ever. Over my rapidly dying body. Clunk. Clunk. Whirr.\u201d Grumpy\u2019s system was suffering severe overload from a government making up policy on the hoof behind his back. Grumpy made his excuses and made a quick dash for the exit.</p> <p>The reason for Grumpy\u2019s systems failure soon became even clearer. It wasn\u2019t just the opposition that was learning how to oppose. It was also the Tory backbenchers who were beginning to find their voice. \u201cMy duty to represent my constituents transcends that of my duty to the party,\u201d said Dominic Grieve. The sentiment was echoed by Anna Soubry, Nicky Morgan, Claire Perry, Chris Philp, Ken Clarke, Maria Miller and Alastair Burt.</p> <p>Back at No 10, Theresa May could see her majority slipping away in front of her eyes. There must be no vote prior to article 50 being triggered after all. She picked up the phone and told Eustice that when he had talked about putting a Brexit green paper before parliament he\u2019d really been talking about a completely different green paper. Eustice scratched his head. The prime minister\u2019s confusion was contagious.</p>",

It\u2019s had needle, passionate crowds, batting collapses, low scores, high(ish) scores, seamers <em>and</em> spinners taking wickets, and some of the genuinely finest exponents of white-ball cricket anywhere doing their stuff.</p> <p>It\u2019s been great, frankly, for all the legitimate security fears and, in recent days, verbal brouhahas - or perhaps because of them, in the case of the latter. So if the weather is kind, we should have an absorbing finale in store here. England were excellent in turning round a losing position <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/oct/07/england-jake-ball-debut-bangladesh-match-report\">to take the first game</a>, before producing a performance that carried echoes of Old England in crumbling <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/oct/09/mashrafe-mortaza-leads-bangladesh-to-victory-over-england-to-level-series\">to lose the second</a>.</p> <p>But this, nonetheless, has felt like an excellent examination for a still-developing, and partially depleted, visiting team, not least for those relatively inexperienced newcomers thrown into the pressure cooker - this is the first proper test in truly unfamiliar conditions the 50-over side have had since the Glorious Revolution instigated in the golden summer of \u201815. </p> <p>Bangladesh have clearly enjoyed having England here too, which has been shown in the intensity and application of their cricket (most of the time), and in their public\u2019s enthusiasm. The slanging matches, tiresome and distasteful though they often are, can be taken as a compliment by each to the other. Let\u2019s hope the weather holds.</p> <p><strong>Play in Chittagong starts at 9.30am BST.</strong> Don\u2019t go away.</p> </div>   </div>",
  "<p>The territory is marked out in red and blue <a href=\"http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/election-update-women-are-defeating-donald-trump/\" title=\"\">on two maps by statistician Nate Silver</a>. One map of the US showing what would happen if only women voted, the other if only \u201cdudes\u201d did. The lady vote would have Hillary Clinton ahead in typically safe Republican states such as Alaska, Kansas, Indiana, Missouri, Montana, South Dakota, Arizona, Georgia, South Carolina and Texas. She would get&#xa0;458 electoral votes, compared with Donald Trump\u2019s 80.</p> <p>The dude-only map, though, shows that Trump could win every swing state with Clinton just about clinging on to the west coast, parts of the north-east, Illinois and New Mexico. Trump would get 350 electoral votes to Clinton\u2019s 188.</p> <p>Thankfully, this is not a dude-only election. It is not even a Democrat v Republican election. It is an insurgency by a man (and a movement) who, in promising to reinstate America\u2019s supposedly lost greatness, will destroy the GOP establishment. They deserve it. The sudden abhorrence at Trump\u2019s description of sexual assault as banter is ludicrous. Have they ignored everything he said on women, Mexicans, Muslims and black people? The cowardice of the Republican party meant they would not challenge him for fear of damaging their own prospects. They could not care less if the collateral damage is to poor women or black communities.</p> <p>For Trump has been a long time coming: he is the embodiment of the backlash against feminism that many of us recognised in the early 90s.</p> <p>We need to understand how culture and gender intersect with the economy. Votes for Trump might not be deliberately made in the name of a gender war, but that is exactly the battle being fought. Feminism is seen as both triumphant and pass\u00e9. Both views deem it as unnecessary. This backlash has been drip fed into popular culture.</p> <p>Its radicalism was stripped away in the mid-90s by the whole Sex and the City vibe. We could have sex and shoes, if we were white and rich. Lads could be sexist pigs again. Porn became ubiquitous and post-feminists embraced it. Women no longer needed feminism, because they needed men for babies and to open jars. For this they had to be appealing before they were 30 and their eggs shrivelled up. Dating became a desperate game and men preferred women who were free. Just not too free. Men wrote books about how to get women into bed that were akin to rape manuals. But worse was to come: men started embracing their manhood, rejecting \u201ccultural Marxism\u201d or political correctness. By&#xa0;the mid-to-late 2000s, this pushback against the gains of feminism was&#xa0;in full flow.</p> <p>This was implicitly tied to recession. This&#xa0;is something that the likes of Trump and Nigel Farage understand. The right always does. The left, with its eye on class struggle, continues to miss how things play out in terms of gender. The misogyny of a Trump, or his pet tic Farage, does not exist in an economic vacuum.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.vox.com/2015/1/28/7929939/net-worth-decline\" title=\"\">net worth of the bottom 60% of US households is about 14% lower than it was 30 years ago</a>. The <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/04/11/upshot/for-the-poor-geography-is-life-and-death.html?_r=0\" title=\"\">life expectancy gap between rich and poor in the US is growing</a>. The number of single-parent families has risen rapidly. Michelle Alexander, a&#xa0;law professor, says there are <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/10/12/michelle-alexander-more-black-men-in-prison-slaves-1850_n_1007368.html\" title=\"\">more black men in prison than there were slaves in 1850</a>.</p> <p>So the US and its men are in pain. So much so&#xa0;that a <a href=\"http://money.cnn.com/2016/05/04/news/economy/america-left-behind-white-men/\" title=\"\">quarter of white blue-collar workers are&#xa0;unemployed.</a> Many are on prescription painkillers, opiates such as OxyContin. Where there is pain, there is anger. And anger kicks downwards. On to women.</p> <p>This sense of abandonment felt by blue-collar workers feeds the backlash. Britain is a very different country, but the same sense of neglect is&#xa0;there in former industrial areas.</p> <p>I remember interviewing miners who \u201cretired undefeated\u201d, as they said, and would not take the new jobs on offer to them. Their women folk did. This inflexibility, combined with real inequality, feeds exactly into a backlash against women and&#xa0;\u201cimmigrants\u201d. The fragility of the masculine identity produces this hopeless nostalgia for defined gender roles. Look around. Have women \u2013 of every ethnicity \u2013 ever had to look so uniform? Long straight hair, pouty lips, big breasts? That\u2019s just the surface; the substance remains lack of equal pay, sexual violence, attacks on abortion rights, and online abuse. As Susan Faludi <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backlash:_The_Undeclared_War_Against_American_Women\" title=\"\">wrote way back in 1991</a> the backlash is not coherent, it&#xa0;is&#xa0;more of a countercurrent, an undertow. But it&#xa0;will drag us down</p> <p>In yoking economic insecurity to the culture war, Trump and his cohorts threaten liberal certainty. His voters may know that his misogyny is a small price to pay for the change he offers; it may, indeed, be a bonus. The running down of the welfare state, after all, has been a war on women. The war on drugs has been a war on women with more and more women in prison. The overt coupling of patriarchy with race privilege and a militarised police force is visible enough proof to&#xa0;make Trump\u2019s assertion that the American Dream is over feel true.</p> <p>So how come women are rejecting his vision and men are not? What is in it for them? \u201cWhen power is scarce, a little of it is tempting,\u201d wrote Margaret Atwood in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/jan/20/handmaids-tale-margaret-atwood\" title=\"\">The Handmaid\u2019s Tale</a>. A little power. Trump cannot win without women. The fact he thinks that he can reveals his heart of darkness. It still beats strong.</p>",
  "<p>Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign released a new <a href=\"https://www.hillaryclinton.com/tools/way-back-when/\">interactive web ad</a> on Wednesday, unveiling a shuffling timeline that allows users to compare Clinton\u2019s career to that of Republican opponent Donald Trump.</p> <p>In the timeline, Clinton\u2019s campaign pits her work as first lady, senator and secretary of state against some of Trump\u2019s more incendiary remarks and tweets.</p> <p>In 2013, the ad notes, Clinton finished her tenure as secretary of state, four years after she was confirmed. The same year, Trump tweeted about the scourge of sexual assaults in the military, asking: \u201cWhat did these geniuses expect when they put men &amp; women together?\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/331907383771148288\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">26,000 unreported sexual assults in the military-only 238 convictions.

The timeline links to <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/08/27/us/politics/times-1973.html\">New York Times coverage</a> from 1973, when the US justice department sued the Trump Management Corporation and accused Trump and his father of discriminating against black renters. The ad contrasts the federal government\u2019s suit with Clinton\u2019s graduation from Yale Law School the same year and the beginning of her work at the Children\u2019s Defense Fund. </p>",
  "<p>In the distance, Aleppo briefly emerged from the smoke and dust of war, a low grey skyline on a brown summer plain. A heat haze shimmered over the road ahead, shrouding first an abandoned army barracks, then ransacked, smouldering factories, an empty crossroads, and finally, the city itself.</p> <p>Even then, days after the eastern half of the city had been seized by armed Syrians opposed to the rule of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/bashar-al-assad\">Bashar al-Assad</a>, many of Aleppo\u2019s people had fled. Shops were shuttered. Twisted tanks and toppled buses blocked intersections and the few residents on its empty streets scurried past with their heads down.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/08/battles-rage-across-aleppo-as-assad-regime-syria-fights-to-quash-rebels\">These were the first days of August 2012</a>, a momentous time in a civil war that had just seen half of Syria\u2019s second city \u2013 and industrial heart \u2013 fall to an insurrection hatched by the working-class men of its hinterland. It was my first visit to the city, after several earlier trips to nearby towns where the rebel push for northern Syria had been gathering steam. It paved the way for the Guardian\u2019s subsequent reporting on a conflict with no apparent end.</p> <p>In more than 10 journeys to Aleppo, from that first visit in 2012 until my last in December 2014, I have chronicled the decline of one of the world\u2019s oldest continually inhabited cities as it has been ground down by savagery. Modern warfare has done what uprising and invasion have failed to do throughout the ages, transforming half the city into a shell of its prewar self, and imperilling an ancient core that has weathered centuries of conflict and even a devastating earthquake.</p> <p>Along the way, those who remained and fought for its destiny offered windows into a war that has ramifications far beyond the borders of Syria. Long a crossroads of trade and transport, and a hub of empire, Aleppo is again central to the fate of the region, even under the assault of Russian bombers, which have made much of the east uninhabitable over the past year.</p> <p>The rebel-held east was the focus of all my visits; west Aleppo has remained off-limits, functioning with little disruption and firmly under the control of the Syrian regime, which refuses visa requests.</p> <h2><strong>The lethal frontline</strong></h2> <p>On that first trip to the divided city, we moved slowly past makeshift roadblocks to enter an area that had felt foreboding since the popular uprising against Assad transformed into armed insurrection. Aleppo had been a focal point of the initial civic protests, and was now an epicentre of a rebel push, the scars of which were everywhere.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/gallery/2016/oct/11/destruction-in-aleppo-in-pictures\">Destruction in Aleppo - in pictures</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Syrian flags painted across the high walls of government compounds had been machine-gunned.

Families had fled the area hours before. Syrian troops and rebels had gouged holes in the walls of narrow-packed homes to use as rat-runs. As we stepped through the remains, cooking pots \u2013 some full of food \u2013 sat on stove tops and laundry hung on rails. There was something disconcerting about treading through the intimate worlds of strangers who, a little while earlier, had been going about their lives.</p> <p>Now these people were on the road to Turkey, joining tens of thousands of others whose lives had been upended. At a nearby intersection, not far from where the two sides faced off, strangers \u2013 non-Syrians \u2013 were instead arriving. Dressed in dishdashas and head shawls, some with leather ammunition belts strapped across their chests, a small number of Islamic fighters had come to join what to them was a holy war.</p> <p>The new arrivals were the vanguard of the jihadists, who, since May 2012, had started to travel to Syria and assemble in the countryside. They had turned up promising support to willing though underprepared rebel groups who could take the fight to the Assad regime, but faced a serious challenge in defeating it. The newcomers stood warily next to the rebel groups, several mocking the attempts of a band from a nearby town as they tried to shoot a hovering Syrian helicopter out of the sky.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d8773b7f115a7e1a4a7ffeb20f08066d9b0768e2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d8773b7f115a7e1a4a7ffeb20f08066d9b0768e2/0_80_4000_2400/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A wounded rebel fighter is carried to safety, October 2012.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A wounded rebel fighter is carried to safety, October 2012.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Zac Baillie/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cYou donkey!\u201d one of the jihadists screamed. \u201cGive the dushka [heavy weapon] to me.

Throughout the remainder of 2012, they were reinforced daily by others who had also journeyed across the porous Turkish border and had begun to change the tone of the war from nationalistic uprising into an ideological conflict that paid no heed to borders.</p> <p>The jihadists and the regular opposition were barely co-existing. \u201cWe have to accept them because they are coming to help us Islamically,\u201d said Sobhi Mohammed, a fighter from an Islamic unit at the time. \u201cBut we know they don\u2019t want what we want.\u201d Sobhi was based with his unit, all blue-collar workers from the satellite town of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/02/turkey-syria-offensive-each-party-is-fighting-its-own-war-kurds-us-isis\">al-Bab</a>, in the villa of a Syrian officer. With tank fire shuddering in the distance, the men tried to teach themselves to swim in a pea-soup coloured pool fenced by ceramic mermaids.</p> <p>Later that year, Sobhi was killed in a battle nearby. As the ranks of the jihadists grew, the rebels slowly thinned. So too did the few remaining residents of east Aleppo. Scud missiles started to rain down on the city in late 2012, gouging giant craters where whole neighbourhoods once stood. By early the following year, entire suburbs directly east of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2015/mar/24/syria-war-citadel-aleppo-history-cities-buildings\">Aleppo\u2019s historic citadel </a>lay deserted. Airstrikes were happening almost daily. Sniper fire regularly crossed a lethal frontline between east and west. And the regime\u2019s vengeance towards those in the east was about to be showcased in other ways.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"611e8bb9025a78da3e935e24747f047b3708d9b7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/611e8bb9025a78da3e935e24747f047b3708d9b7/0_214_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Some of the bodies of the executed men dumped in the river, January 2013.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Some of the bodies of the executed men dumped in the river, January 2013.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Abdullah al-Yassin/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>Massacre by the river</strong></h2> <p>In mid February 2013, I returned to Aleppo to investigate <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/interactive/2013/mar/11/syria-bodies-river-aleppo-massacre\">the discovery of more than 100 bodies on a river bank</a>. All had been shot in the head, and dumped in the river. As flood waters had receded, they had exposed the fate of the men, who had all been detained as they crossed the frontline. Many had commuted between the two sides for work. Others needed to travel to the west for official business \u2013 there were no longer government offices in the east. For more than a week, locals fished the bodies out of the river, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jan/29/syrian-rebels-bodies-aleppo-canal\">erecting nets and grills to trap them as they washed down</a>. Families in the eastern area of Bustan al-Qasr all confirmed that their husbands, fathers, sons and cousins had disappeared at checkpoints. Most had been held in regime prisons.</p> <p>Even darker days were soon to follow. In April that year, the jihadists who had lurked with intent announced that they were now in charge, subverting the myriad opposition groups \u2013 and their cause \u2013 in the name of a global jihad. The Islamic State (Isis) had unveiled itself after a year long Trojan horse act of hiding in plain sight. A ruthless elimination of rival power bases followed, along with the imposition of an unflinching Islamic order. The front of the eye hospital, the rebel base at the start of the war, was painted black. The standards of the jihadists were planted everywhere. Streets were even emptier, women rarely seen.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>More than 100 men had been shot in the head and dumped in the river, the flood waters receding to expose their fate</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Throughout the rest of 2013, east Aleppo was one of the most dangerous places on earth. In September, I visited again, this time under the escort of a member of a rebel group from al-Bab that was convinced it could ward off Isis. The east had been whittled down even further. Civic services had all but stopped. Local volunteers gathered rubbish and burned it on an enormous noxious heap near the south of the town. Medical aid was scarce, but still the hospital system was getting by.</p> <p>Outside one hospital, down the hill from Saif al-Dawla, a clapped-out ambulance sat at an odd angle on a footpath matted with blood and a filthy pile of white burial shrouds. Above them, on a small ledge, lay a dead infant girl, wrapped in a pink towel and left anonymously. She stayed there for most of the day, exhausted medics dealing with the rush of the dying before they tended to her.</p> <p>Outside the eye hospital, a lone Isis fighter sat on the back of a pickup truck with a heavy machine gun pointed at the sky. The jihadists were expecting US jets at the time. None arrived, but Syrian helicopters soon did, dropping improvised explosives packed into barrels over what remained of the eastern suburbs.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8eb4be1c39939203a65977b47ba4f127780918aa\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8eb4be1c39939203a65977b47ba4f127780918aa/0_260_5330_3199/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A child wounded in a Russian airstrike, October 2016.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A child wounded in a Russian airstrike, October 2016.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Anadolu Agency/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>A deserted wasteland</strong></h2> <p>By early the following year, Aleppo had devolved even further. In January, rebel groups who had been sidelined by Isis for the previous nine months, turned their guns on the extremists, ousting them first from the city and then from the countryside. Isis retreated to al-Bab, which has since remained its most western position in Syria. The city, or what remained of it, was once again accessible, but this time under the noses of regime troops who had all but encircled the east.</p> <p>A small gap, called the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/13/syrian-regime-is-blocking-aid-from-entering-eastern-aleppo-claims-un\">Castello Road</a>, remained open to the north. It led to an industrial zone that used to be a central driver of Syria\u2019s economy, but is now a wasteland of fallen silos and factories that have been repeatedly crunched with heavy bombs. The road was one of the most menacing strips in Syria. And once through it, the devastation of east Aleppo was almost overwhelming.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/10/future-wars-horrific-aleppo-war-zones-medical-facilities-un\">If we don't act now, all future wars may be as horrific as Aleppo  | Paul Mason</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Near the city\u2019s outskirts, no one remained, except for small groups of rebels with radios who kept tabs on pro-regime militia forces gathering beyond the city limits. Three hospitals that had been functioning on our last visit had been destroyed by airstrikes. Much of the northern city had been emptied. Long sweeping boulevards that channelled commuter traffic were silent and sinister.</p> <p>The Old City, however, had remained a sanctuary. Here, market life went on. Butchers hung carcasses just out of reach of starving cats, and Turkish confectionery was piled alongside traditional Syrian sweet stalls. The cobblestoned roads were almost a safe zone for fighters and the remaining residents of east Aleppo. Here they could congregate as they always had, ignoring jets that mostly dropped their bombs elsewhere.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"a4142796da2173d249bc142fd01a66d9d21e2304\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a4142796da2173d249bc142fd01a66d9d21e2304/0_127_3300_1980/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A man sits in the rubble of a damaged buildings after losing relatives in an airstrike, October 2016.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A man sits in the rubble of a damaged buildings after losing relatives in an airstrike, October 2016.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Abdalrhman Ismail/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The illusion lasted only half a mile though, where it ended in the enormous pile of rubble that marked a frontline. Here, Abu Assad, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/may/20/aleppos-most-wanted-man-rebel-leader-tunnel-bombs\">one of the original rebels of the countryside</a>, had led a team of tunnel diggers, who had burrowed under regime lines and blown up a hotel on the edge of the Citadel. Nothing was left of the building, and the enormous blast had damaged the wall of the Citadel itself. The war that was supposed to spare Aleppo\u2019s ancient core had crept closer than ever.</p> <h2><strong>Jets prowl the sky</strong></h2> <p>In December 2014, I returned to the city for the last time. Finding residents in the east was difficult. Those who had stayed this long had no plans to leave. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/dec/02/-sp-female-medic-aleppo-syria-war-umm-abdu\">Umm Abdu, a wedding dress seamstress turned nurse was one of them.</a> She made her way from the Old City to a nearby hospital, a pistol strapped to her waist as she patched up fighters and civilians. She had lost a husband and a son in the relentless war. Everyone she knew had at least one tragic story. East Aleppo had no electricity and little running water. This time the road out of the city took us along muddy tracks gouged through farmland. A sand berm sheltered the road from sniper fire, and jets prowled the sky.</p> <p>It has been all but impossible to reach east Aleppo in the year and a half since, a time in which the divided city\u2019s agony has grown even worse. The Russian blitz has relentlessly targeted what remains of its basic services. Only two hospitals and two smaller clinics are still functioning and only 11 ambulances still service them. Umm Abdu has left Aleppo, and few of the others I met along the way have stayed behind. The Russian-led assault has demolished the east, and pro-regime militias are poised to move in. After 3,000 years, Aleppo is on its knees.</p>",

The rest of the team, following the tone that we set, were pretty nasty to each other, too. </p> <p>Each day I\u2019d slog up the stairs to the office feeling heavy-hearted, wondering what new onslaught of unkindness Horatio and I would inflict on each other.

That, in turn, may have made him too emotionally worn out to resist criticizing me for not making enough cups of tea for the rest of the team (yes, the job was in England).</p> <p>Workplaces are weird environments: places where we spend the majority of our waking hours with people who, for the most part, we don\u2019t choose ourselves. Over time, this can lead to the development of beautiful friendships \u2013 indeed, one of my best friends was sourced from that rude workplace.</p> <p>But in many other cases, the endurance of the people with whom fate and your LinkedIn profile have destined you to spend your life takes a degree of emotional labor that is too easily abandoned when deadlines loom and patience thins. Of course rudeness begets rudeness: why treat another person with kindness and respect when you are on the receiving end of neither?</p> <p>Only time will tell whether managers will take this research to heart and put it to practical application in their workplaces.

  "<p>The families of Hillsborough victims have attacked the police watchdog after it refused to investigate the suspended South Yorkshire police chief constable, David Crompton, over his role at the inquests.</p> <p>Lawyers for 22 Hillsborough families had asked the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) to investigate whether Crompton told lawyers to \u201cpour blame\u201d on Liverpool fans for the disaster.</p> <p>The families alleged that Crompton and South Yorkshire police pursued the strategy in an attempt to deflect blame away from the force for the deaths of 96 fans at the FA Cup semi-final on 15 April 1989.</p> <p>The two-year inquest <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/apr/26/hillsborough-inquests-jury-says-96-victims-were-unlawfully-killed\">concluded in April</a> that the 96 victims were unlawfully killed and a catalogue of failings by police and the ambulance services had contributed to their deaths.</p> <p>The IPCC said on Wednesday it had decided not to investigate Crompton because investigators would not be able to access legally privileged communication between the chief constable and the force\u2019s lawyers. As a result, it said, any investigation would be \u201csignificantly hampered\u201d.</p> <p>The decision was immediately criticised by lawyers representing the families of 22 Hillsborough victims.</p> <p>Elkan Abrahamson, of the law firm Jackson Canter, said the IPCC decision was predictable and that \u201cyet again SYP [South Yorkshire police] protect their own, yet again the IPCC are impotent, and yet again the taxpayer will foot the bill when Mr Crompton sues the force for unfair dismissal\u201d.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>In separate legal recriminations arising from the inquests, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/30/south-yorkshire-police-chief-court-action-calls-resign-hillsborough\">Crompton is suing the South Yorkshire police and crime commissioner</a>, Alan Billings, for ordering him to step down over a public statement he made after the jury\u2019s verdicts.<br></p> <p>Trevor Hicks, whose daughters Sarah and Vicki died in the disaster, said of the decision: \u201cI\u2019m disappointed with it and it looks as though the IPCC has taken the soft option to use what we consider a technicality to brush it away.

The IPCC were represented by counsel in the inquest proceedings so they know precisely how Mr Crompton conducted SYP\u2019s case. </p> <p>\u201cFrom blaming the supporters, Sheffield Wednesday stewards and the council, SYP tried to avoid responsibility, directly contrary to Mr Crompton\u2019s public apology and acceptance of responsibility in 2012.</p> <p>\u201cSo long as senior public servants are allowed to act with impunity there will be little trust in the police, the IPCC or public authorities generally.\u201d</p> <p>The IPCC said it had assessed some material and concluded that although South Yorkshire police\u2019s barristers did ask several questions about fan behaviour at the inquests \u201cthese were infrequent and did not suggest \u2026 a deliberate or calculated approach\u201d. </p> <p>The IPCC deputy chair Rachel Cerfontyne said: \u201cThe approach taken by some legal teams at the inquests clearly caused distress among those affected by the disaster. </p> <p>\u201cHowever, the evidence we have assessed doesn\u2019t indicate that a criminal or misconduct offence has occurred. This, combined with the fact we cannot review any legal instructions from Mr Crompton to his legal team, has led me to conclude that an IPCC investigation could not provide any meaningful response to the complaint.\u201d</p>",

Lance Weiler, director of the Digital Storytelling Lab at Columbia University, discovered this first-hand through his work on <a href=\"http://2016.sherlockholmes.io/welcome/\">Sherlock Holmes and the Internet of Things</a>, an online global detective narrative collaboration. The Lab set up a crime scene and provided clues to solve a murder, but that wasn\u2019t enough. The participants wanted to imagine the crime and write the clues themselves. \u201cA new creator class is rising up,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd it\u2019s challenging the authorship and ownership of stories.\u201d</p> <p>The FoST festival, which ran from 7-9 October in New York, showcased the extraordinary range of work emerging as a result, bringing together leading storytellers from the worlds of gaming, theatre, film, publishing, television and virtual reality (VR). In a Harlem warehouse \u2013 imagine Charlie Kaufman\u2019s Synecdoche, New York meets The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus \u2013 a cornucopia of interactive experiences beckoned. I wandered between real and imaginary worlds, as if dreaming while awake \u2013 from acting a part in <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=romB8e5nMp8\">Star Trek: Bridge Crew</a>, to entering the curious and desolate world of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KoJLZ2u_Asg\">SENS VR</a>, the first graphic novel to get VR treatment. Participating in a collective immersive session in the 30-person VR theatre, I even pondered the nature of free will while inhabiting the mind of an android re-creation of Philip K Dick, in the 360-film <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwNVKDOniQU\">I, Philip</a>.<br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/apr/29/samsung-thinks-the-future-of-childrens-bedtime-is-virtual-reality-stories\">Samsung thinks the 'future of children's bedtime' is virtual reality stories</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The experiences that most captured my imagination were those that brought me into the world of the characters and allowed me to influence the story. We say we \u201center the minds of characters\u201d when we read books, but role-playing in immersive worlds, such as VR narratives or theatre, takes that sense of immediacy to a whole other level: the narrative feels like something you actually experience. Speaking at the FoST Festival, Beau Lotto, neuroscientist at <a href=\"https://ripple.com/\">Ripple</a>, <a href=\"http://www.labofmisfits.com/\">Lab of Misfits</a> and development studio The Chinese Room, explains the satisfaction of being in the driver\u2019s shoes as \u201cthe Ikea effect\u201d. \u201cIf you put effort into something, you perceive a higher value.\u201d Felix Barrett, artistic director at Punchdrunk theatre company that makes the immersive show <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2015/mar/31/sleep-no-more-avant-garde-theatre-new-york\">Sleep No More</a>, agrees; as immersive narrative VR experiences become more commonplace, theatrical experience is becoming more about audience empowerment: \u201cThey own their night \u2026 it\u2019s their narrative.\u201d<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"058612f6120f2c14fd668cb23d56424cd5c65648\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/058612f6120f2c14fd668cb23d56424cd5c65648/0_5_529_317/500.jpg\" alt=\"A still from Sleep No More.\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A still from Sleep No More.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Punchdrunk</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Creating a feeling of agency is no simple task, and today\u2019s narrative architects employ sophisticated game mechanics and crafty tricks to make decision-making feel fluid and natural for the user. \u201cToo much agency and the story won\u2019t have a good arc,\u201d says Barrett. Audiences can choose their route and tempo, but there are anchor points and the finale must deliver: \u201cThere is the illusion of agency, but they are on rails.\u201d This nuanced approach suggests we are entering a sophisticated new era in which the exchange between author and participant creates a better outcome for both, leaving questionable author-fan collaborations of the past behind.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/dec/03/pixar-virtual-reality-storytelling-ed-catmull\">Pixar co-founder warns virtual-reality moviemakers: 'It's not storytelling'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>To be successful in this emerging genre, storytellers, especially those moving from traditional roles in publishing, television and film, will need to adapt, in particular by learning new methods of collaborating with users and the new languages of VR technologies. Dan Pinchbeck, creative director at The Chinese Room, points out that already in the gaming industry there is no single writer churning out a plot; what is most important is the focus on developing complex characters, as that offers greater possibilities in a branching, emergent narrative. In <a href=\"http://www.thechineseroom.co.uk/games/everybodys-gone-to-the-rapture/\">Everybody\u2019s Gone to the Rapture</a>, a game about the end of the world, the writers focused on creating compelling characters. The end of the world became the least interesting thing about it; what mattered was how the characters dealt with it. </p> <p>At Apelab, a studio currently working on <a href=\"http://apelab.ch/sequenced/\">Sequenced</a> \u2013 an episodic adventure where the story adapts in real time depending on where you look and focus \u2013 they begin with paper, pencils and role-playing. Apelab\u2019s founder, Emilie Joly, says that very early on in the creative process they thought about interactivity and how the narrative was going to be directed by the user, as well as where the user was going to be in space. Early experience testing is also important. While working on <a href=\"http://www.baobabstudios.com/\">Invasion</a>!, an immersive VR short film, the team at Baobab Studios did a lot of early prototype testing. Decisions including bringing a spaceship in above the user, with only the sound behind, didn\u2019t have the desired effect. But once a key character \u2013 a cute big-eyed bunny \u2013 looked up at the spaceship, 99% of the audience turned around. It has never been more important to understand how audiences experience and react to the interactive world you are trying to create. As Kane Lee, head of content at Baobab Studios, says: \u201cIt\u2019s about letting go of your ego \u2026 letting the user help you navigate.\u201d<br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2011/feb/23/video-games-writers-novelists\">Virtual reality needs real writers</a> </p> </aside>  <p>As exciting as it is to work with diverse technologies and audiences in new ways, almost everyone speaking at FoST festival agreed that the story should always come first, then the technology. \u201cStories can have many different platforms to live in, but it\u2019s important to figure out which is the right medium for the story,\u201d said Melcher, who decided to <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/02/nyregion/storytelling-in-the-virtual-age-at-fost-fest.html\">move to the storytelling business</a> when his book publishing enterprise stalled. At the end of the day, agrees David Eisenman, producer of Google Spotlight Stories, his main priority is to work with great storytellers and collaborators. As content creators increasingly cede control, the need for expert storytellers has never been greater.</p> <h2>Three digital experiences to look out for</h2> <p><br><strong>Late Shift<br></strong>Watching the <a href=\"http://lateshift-movie.com\">Late Shift</a> teaser at FoST festival, I joined an audience of people collectively deciding the fate of the protagonist, a car park attendant whose night gets interesting when he\u2019s coerced, at gun point, into helping a dubious character escape in a stolen car. With smartphones in hand, the majority vote decides the character\u2019s fate, while the film keeps running seamlessly. I\u2019m surprised to find that my choices are often in the majority, pushing the protagonist into greater and greater peril. Should I admit that my enjoyment rises as his situation deteriorates? It isn\u2019t hard to imagine, as the full feature story progresses, that the stakes will be raised with every new decision, and, concomitant with my role in influencing the outcome, my investment in the story.</p> <p><strong>The Abbot\u2019s Book<br></strong>When it comes to the best way to experience a 3D or 4D narrative, many storytellers are gravitating towards the first person perspective. For the team at Blackthorn Media working on <a href=\"http://store.steampowered.com/app/434430/\">The Abbot\u2019s Book</a>, featured at the Sundance film festival\u2019s New Frontier program this year, the whole reason to do VR came into focus when they put the user into the protagonist\u2019s shoes. \u201cThe most forward-looking way, the best way to jump into this world, was to literally put on a second skin and be different characters in the story,\u201d says Michael Conelly, creative director at the LA-based VR start-up. The Abbot\u2019s Book is an immersive VR narrative series based on a gothic novella by the same name, written by Conelly in 1989. I demoed it with the handheld controllers of the HTC Vive in their LA offices and was as enthralled by the mysterious magic of the world as I was by my mission: to explore the ancient catacombs below the ruins of an 18th-century abbey and uncover the horror of the ancient pagan religion contained within.</p> <p><strong>1979 Revolution: Black Friday<br></strong>In this choice-driven narrative game set in Tehran, and based on true stories and historical events, you are thrown into the turmoil of a real-life revolution and must make vital choices in the fight to survive. Playing Reza, an aspiring photojournalist during an uprising against the ruling king, the user\u2019s choices subtly shape the narrative and the fates of characters around them. I demoed a six-minute section of <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://inkstories.com/1979revolutiongame/#quotesandtrailer\">the game</a> on an iPad at the FoST festival and was immediately drawn in by the realistic characters, beautiful CGI graphics and documentary-style narrative. <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_50OJ1uuGoc\">With 19 chapters to explore</a>, new storytelling forms like this can be vital \u2013 bringing diverse stories about the world to new audiences and allowing us the rare opportunity to experience life through someone else\u2019s eyes.</p>",

Which means \u2013 for some candidates \u2013 there is a problem. On the one hand they can see the blowback Ryan is experiencing, suggesting there may be costs to bailing on Trump; on the other Trump\u2019s candidacy simply may depress the number of voters who turn out. This is a harder group to talk about since it does depend on district-by-district knowledge.\u201d</p> <p>Whit Ayres, a veteran political consultant and pollster for Rubio\u2019s presidential campaign, agreed: \u201cIt\u2019s really too early to assess until we\u2019ve had time to get some polling data back.

The goal, Ryan said, was to ensure Clinton did not get a \u201cblank check\u201d with a Democratic-controlled Congress should she win. <br></p> <p>Ryan received both support and criticism from House members, some of whom warned that it was the very strategy of ostracising Trump, rather than backing him, that could cost them the House.</p> <p>On Tuesday, Trump used Twitter to fire off attacks on Ryan.

There was a time where they could\u2019ve spoken out against him. That time was the summer and obviously it\u2019s too late now.\u201d</p> <p>In a signal that the campaign was not abandoning its courtship of Republicans and independent voters, Palmieri noted that the campaign launched ads featuring Republican voters backing Clinton in key battleground states, including Florida, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Nevada and Iowa. </p> <p>\u201cDonald Trump didn\u2019t become the nominee of his party on his own. The leaders helped legitimise him and I think they have a lot to answer for, and I imagine voters will hold them accountable, too,\u201d Palmieri continued, singling out the Senate races in Arizona and New Hampshire, where Republican incumbents McCain and Ayotte had withdrawn their endorsements of Trump.</p> <p>On Monday, McCain, the 2008 Republican presidential nominee, was forced to contend with his decision to disavow Trump. <br></p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not pleasant for me to renounce the nominee of our party,\u201d the Arizona senator said during a debate in Phoenix with his Democratic challenger, Ann Kirkpatrick. \u201cHe won the nomination fair and square. But \u2026 I have daughters. I have friends. I have so many wonderful people on my staff. They cannot be degraded and demeaned in that fashion.\u201d</p> <p>Ian Prior, communications director of Republicans\u2019 Senate Leadership Fund, remained optimistic. <br></p> <p>\u201cFrom day one, Senate Republicans have been running their races focused on the particular issues that are important in their respective states,\u201d he said. \u201cBecause of that, they are well positioned to withstand any cross currents from the top of the ticket and, consequently, this gives Republicans a good chance at retaining the majority in the Senate.\u201d</p> <p>But Obama, arguably still the most effective messenger for Democrats, twisted the knife while campaigning for Clinton on Tuesday. <br></p> <p>\u201cYou can\u2019t have it both ways here!\u201d Obama told voters in North Carolina. \u201cYou can\u2019t repeatedly denounce what is said by someone and then say, \u2018But I\u2019m still gonna endorse \u2019em to be the most powerful person on the planet!\u2019</p> <p>\u201cThe fact that now you\u2019ve got people saying, \u2018Well, we strongly disapprove.

It later transpired that none of them had served alongside him, and Bush was of course a draft dodger, but the damage was done.</p> <h2><strong>The Bear</strong><strong> (1984)</strong></h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpwdcmjBgNA\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/NpwdcmjBgNA?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>In sharp contrast to the pro-Reagan hymn <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn9fR_-X9uw\">Prouder, Stronger, Better</a>, this ingenious, insidious ad paired a pulsing soundtrack with sinister, ambiguous images of a grizzly wandering around the woods. The implicit Soviet imagery was clear enough, but it pressed home Reagan\u2019s message of peace through strength without screaming about it. And the last line \u2013 \u201cisn\u2019t it smart to be as strong as the bear, if there is a bear?\u201d \u2013 was a killer conversation-starter.</p> <h2><strong>South</strong><strong> (1976)</strong></h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8wiic-ivro\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/K8wiic-ivro?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>After the paranoid and unscrupulous Nixon era, Georgian peanut farmer Jimmy Carter cast himself carefully as a man of the people. From the banjo-picking soundtrack to the bucolic backdrop, this ad marked a refreshing return to straightforward, uncynical campaigning and demonstrated the enduring appeal of the outsider, distant from DC horse-trading. Gerald Ford never stood a chance.</p> <h2><strong>Ike for President</strong><strong> (1952)</strong></h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YmCDaXeDRI4\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/YmCDaXeDRI4?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>This Walt Disney-created effort pairs a catchy tune (\u201cHang out the banner, beat the drum, we\u2019ll take Ike to Washington\u201d) with irresistibly cute animation \u2013 an elephant banging a drum! Babies brandishing balloons! \u2013 to create a message so simple it\u2019s virtually meaningless. There\u2019s nothing dull like policy statements here, just feel-good fun to get voters whistling all the way to the ballot box, where they would vote Eisenhower in their droves.</p> <h2><strong>Kennedy for Me</strong><strong> (1960)</strong></h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vs5ORK8RLWk\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/vs5ORK8RLWk?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>In many ways a continuation of Ike-era innocence, Kennedy for Me allied childish illustrations with a hummable tune, slightly more pointed this time (\u201ca president who\u2019s seasoned through and through, but not so doggone seasoned that he won\u2019t try something new\u201d). This blast of irrepressible optimism buoyed JFK through choppy waters until his murder, which ensured a very different tone for 1964. The age of the attack ad had dawned and political campaigning changed forever.</p>",

  "<p>The population of London grew at twice the rate of the UK as a whole between 2011 and 2015, and could reach almost 10 million by the middle of next decade, official figures show.</p> <p>In mid-2011, the population of the city stood at 8.2 million, but over four years it increased by 469,000 to just under 8.7 million, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said. </p> <p>The arrival of almost 200,000 people from overseas each year, and an average of 130,000 births a year drove the city\u2019s growth, and offset the high numbers leaving the city for other countries and the rest of the UK.</p> <p>The ONS figures show the population of London increased by 5.7% between mid-2011 and mid-2015, compared with growth of 2.9% for the UK as a whole. Over the same period, the cost of housing in the capital has rocketed \u2013 Land Registry figures show that the average price of a property rose by 47% between June and 2011 and June 2015, from \u00a3285,906 to \u00a3419,474.</p> <p>After Greater London, Bristol was the city that saw the biggest boom in residents, with its population rising by 4.5%, or 49,000, to 1.1 million.<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/tools/tables/embed/index.html?spreadsheet=1S08-YKi0d-iL8809Q1RqnZRu8TFmLDqFyQM46zv8yZw\" data-alt=\"UK cities population growth\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/tools/tables/embed/index.html?spreadsheet=1S08-YKi0d-iL8809Q1RqnZRu8TFmLDqFyQM46zv8yZw\">UK cities population growth</a> </figure>  <p>\u201cDiffering levels of population growth across different cities and regions are often a reflection of the economic strength of the location, with areas where the economy is performing strongest often experiencing most population growth,\u201d the ONS said.</p> <p>London, with its robust economy, has attracted far more movers from overseas than other parts of the UK, the figures show. Over the four-year period in question, an average of 192,000 people a year moved to London from abroad \u2013 including Britons who have returned after a period living overseas \u2013 while 95,000 moved in the other direction.</p> <p>Net international migration to Greater London averaged 97,000 a year, out of a figure of 236,000 for the UK as a whole. </p> <p>\u201cLondon\u2019s attraction to immigrants no doubt reflects its status as a major employment centre and international hub,\u201d said the ONS. </p> <p>\u201cWith its high ethnic-minority population it may prove especially attractive to people wishing to join family or others from that cultural background. In addition, for people heading to the UK, London is somewhere they are more likely to have some pre-existing awareness of than other parts of the country \u2013 perhaps because of previous visits, but also simply because it has a higher profile as the UK capital.\u201d<br></p> <p>Because many immigrants are young adults, the comparatively high immigration to Greater London affects all its other population dynamics, the ONS said. Over the period in question, there were an average 130,000 births in the capital each year and just 48,000 deaths. </p> <p>The figures also showed large numbers of people leaving Greater London for other parts of the UK. Each year an average of 63,200 people left the capital, with the 22- to 29-year-old age group the only one where more people moved in.<br></p> <p>Among 30- to 44-year-olds, 33,600 more people moved out of Greater London than into the city each year, while amongchildren that figure was 31,700. </p> <p></p> <p>In contrast, Bristol saw more people move in from around the UK, with net internal migration averaging 3,700 a year between mid-2011 and mid-2015. The population of Edinburgh was also boosted by internal migration, with 2,700 more people moving into the Scottish capital than out.

We were not living in the past, nor were we pretending that we were a part of the grunge movement. Songs like Keep the Faith were inspired by the LA riots, the Rodney King beating, the Berlin Wall coming down, and we were maturing as a band.

  "<p>The BBC was able to strike a deal to keep showing the Olympics partly because US pay-TV giant Discovery feared a backlash if it refused to share its rights to the Games with the corporation.</p> <p>Discovery, the owner of Eurosport, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/jun/29/bbc-loses-control-olympic-tv-rights-discovery-eurosport\">struck a shock \u00a3920m deal to take control of the rights to the Olympics from the BBC</a> in the UK as well as across Europe from 2022.<br></p> <p>Discovery later struck a sub-licensing deal with the BBC as its free-to-air broadcasting partner in the UK; in turn the corporation allowed Eurosport to start broadcasting the Winter and Summer Olympics from next year.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/jun/16/eurosport-live-wimbledon-coverage-bbc\">Eurosport gets green light for live Wimbledon coverage</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cYes there was economics involved and yes you can argue about the rights here and there [being aired free by Discovery in some European markets] but I don\u2019t think anyone at Discovery wanted to be the people that took the Olympics off the BBC,\u201d said Peter Hutton, chief executive of Eurosport, at a Broadcasting Press Guild event. <br></p> <p>\u201cWe spend a lot of time looking after our brand. We want to be seen as someone who genuinely helps the sports industry and is positive to sports fans. You don\u2019t want to be associated with [negative] stories that make the sports viewing experience worse.\u201d</p> <p>As part of the regulations of the International Olympic Committee, which auctions the rights to the Olympics, Discovery had to strike a deal to make hundreds of hours of Olympic coverage available on free-to-air TV.</p> <p>The company could have aired all of the Olympics on its own free-to-air channels, in Norway and Sweden it is doing just that, or in the UK could have looked at ITV, Channel 4 or Channel 5.</p> <p>\u201cIf you look at what we have done in Norway and Sweden for example the plans are we show everything on our own channels, we have big free-to-air channels [there], that takes us down one direction,\u201d said Hutton. \u201cYou look at the UK and what the BBC have done with London in particular, that was an amazing achievement and success story for the Olympics, the BBC.\u201d</p> <p>Hutton said the fact that keeping the Olympics with the BBC, which does not run ads, instead of a commercial free-to-air partner was not made because it will mean Eurosport will be the exclusive place that companies can run ads around Olympic events for the first time in the UK.</p> <p>\u201cGenuinely it was not a big factor,\u201d he said. \u201cI think let\u2019s see where we go with our Olympic ad sales story. if you put it on the BBC it is going to get a huge audience. Also [that means] putting it in a place people have always seen as the natural home of the Olympics.\u201d</p> <p>Hutton said that under the IOC deal Eurosport is allowed to start using the Olympic rings on its channel from 1 January next year.</p> <p>\u201cWe will start putting Olympic-related content on the channel from that day,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are allowed to call ourselves the home of the Olympics.\u201d</p> <p>In February, Eurosport <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/feb/17/bbcs-jonathan-edwards-makes-the-jump-to-eurosport-in-exclusive-deal\">struck an exclusive deal with Jonathan Edwards</a> to be its lead presenter fronting flagship sports programming including the Olympics. </p> <p>Asked if Eurosport intended to raid the BBC\u2019s presenting lineup for further big name talent to boost its Olympic coverage, Hutton said:</p> <p>\u201cNo. I think with something like the Olympics it is really important to talk to the BBC and say \u2018look, you do this, we\u2019ll do that\u2019 and create complementary coverage,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is no point going in there and being aggressive, that\u2019s a waste of effort.\u201d</p> <p>Hutton also said that Eurosport harbours plans to dramatically increase its Wimbledon coverage.</p> <p>Earlier this year, Eurosport became the first commercial pay-TV broadcaster to be allowed to broadcast live coverage of Wimbledon in the UK after finalising deals with the All England Lawn Tennis Club.</p> <p>The deal to simultaneously air the final live as well as daily evening highlights also required agreement from the BBC, which has aired Wimbledon for eight decades, and broadcasting regulator Ofcom.</p> <p>\u201cThe BBC have allowed us in, that is clear, they didn\u2019t need to do this deal but they allowed us in,\u201d said Hutton. \u201cWe\u2019d love to do more with them [the BBC and rights holder AETC].\u201d</p> <p>Eurosport has been building its relationship with AETC, which holds the rights to the Wimbledon tournament] across Europe in recent years.</p> <p>The broadcaster started several years ago with the rights to air Wimbledon in just one market, Belgium. This year that expanded to 12 markets across Europe.</p> <p>Next year Hutton revealed that Eurosport will broadcast Wimbledon to in excess of 25 markets, and he is aiming to expand the relationship further.</p> <p>\u201cMaybe there are things we can do in the build up like the [Wimbledon] qualifiers, the juniors [Wimbledon tournament] or disabled players. I hope we can talk to Wimbledon and ask how we can deepen that relationship in the UK and other markets if there is space. I think they saw we offered something that didn\u2019t hurt the BBC and that is important.\u201d </p>",
  "<p></p> <p>With Donald Trump\u2019s campaign still reeling from his lascivious comments about groping women on an 11-year-old tape, a growing number of GOP mega-donors and outside groups are fretting about the Republicans losing their congressional majorities, and scrambling to pour tens of millions more into ads and voter mobilization drives in tight races to stave off Democratic challengers.</p> <p>The release of Trump\u2019s remarks about assaulting women on Friday and his slash-and-burn attacks on Hillary Clinton and her husband in the second presidential debate, have fueled growing Republican worries about the Democrats taking one or both houses, say GOP donors and former members. If Clinton wins, meaning Vice-President Tim Kaine would hold the casting vote in the Senate, meaning the Democrats would only need to pick up four seats to control the upper chamber. The Republicans currently have 54 Senate seats, and the Democrats 44, along with two independents who caucus with them. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/29/scott-walker-investigation-wisconsin-lawmakers-john-doe-papers\">Wisconsin lawmakers urge investigation of Scott Walker after 'John Doe' papers</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In two tight Senate contests, Nevada and New Hampshire, GOP candidates on Saturday announced they could no longer stomach Trump, and called on him to withdraw.

Besides Nevada and New Hampshire, the others are Indiana, North Carolina, Missouri and Pennsylvania. Last week the Chamber of Commerce began its fourth ad buy in Nevada, a $1m effort to help representative Joe Heck win the Senate seat of retiring Senator Harry Reid.</p> <p>Several days after the first debate, the conservative big donor and advocacy network led by the billionaire Koch brothers \u2013 which has said it isn\u2019t backing Trump due to strong concerns about his policies and rhetoric \u2013 hosted a conference call with donors, asking for at least $10m more for Senate ads and get-out-the-vote efforts which have been its major focus, a donor who was on the call told the Guardian. </p> <p>The Koch network, which expects to spend about $42m this year on TV and digital ads in eight states, might spend a few million more on \u201cstrategic media buys\u201d and voter mobilization drives, said James Davis of Freedom Partners Chamber of Commerce, the financial hub of the sprawling advocacy network. Koch-backed advocacy groups, Davis added, are now \u201cfocused on turning out 5 million voters in the eight states\u201d.</p> <p>The Koch network\u2019s concerns about the Senate were underscored for donors when they received an email, seen by the Guardian, with new poll results in key races, which painted a worrisome picture.</p> <p>Two other cash-rich outside groups, a Super Pac dubbed the Senate Leadership Fund and an allied non-profit called One Nation, have stepped up their fundraising efforts. </p> <p>As of 1 September the two groups had raised just under $100m this election cycle, including $42.4m in August. And the Leadership Fund expects to spend close to $75m in seven key states in September and October combined, according to a spokesman. Adelson and his wife have has given the Super Pac $20m and chipped in $10m to the allied non-profit, according to records and fundraising sources.</p> <p>Other conservative groups and their big donors are worried about losing the Senate. \u201cVictory for us is keeping the Senate and the latest disgusting episode doesn\u2019t help us,\u201d said Michael Epstein of the Republican Jewish Coalition, a staunchly pro-Israel group heavily backed by Adelson. \u201cTrump is a destructive force \u2026 He\u2019s hurting the country, the GOP and the Trump brand.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Two leading civil rights organizations are calling for the complete decriminalization of personal drug use in the US in a comprehensive new report released on Wednesday.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/report/2016/10/12/every-25-seconds/human-toll-criminalizing-drug-use-united-states\">report</a>, published by the American Civil Liberties Union and Human Rights Watch, concluded that last year someone was arrested every 25 seconds on drug use or possession charges. </p> <p>The research catalogues the enforcement of laws that criminalize personal drug use, for which police make more arrests than any other crime. The organizations\u2019 stand is one of the most forceful yet in the ongoing conversation about the country\u2019s sprawling criminal justice system and the lasting effect that low-level drug offenses can have on Americans.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/apr/15/lee-carroll-brooker-alabama-marijuana-sentence\">Supreme court considers taking case of man given life in prison for growing pot</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cThis is first time both organizations have come together and made such a strong call for [decriminalization],\u201d said Tess Borden, the report\u2019s author.</p> <p>The report, titled Every 25 Seconds, after the frequency of drug arrests, looks specifically at personal drug use, and not trafficking or other drug crimes. Last year, more than 1.25 million arrests were made by local law enforcement for drug use or possession alone, and about half of those were for marijuana use or possession, according to the report. </p> <p>Tyler Marshall, a Louisiana man who spoke to Human Rights Watch using a pseudonym, was charged with marijuana possession in 2015 and sentenced to 10 years in prison after pleading guilty. The report quotes court transcripts of Marshall entering his guilty plea, as most drug cases are resolved. After Marshall\u2019s defense attorney instructs him to plea guilty, he tells the court: \u201cOh, I have to? Yeah. But I\u2019d be lying though.\u201d</p> <p>The large majority of drug cases are resolved through plea deals. In New York, for example, the report found that 99.8% of adults convicted of drug possession in a five-year period accepted plea deals.</p> <p>Marshall told Human Rights Watch that his wife has a disability, and was two months behind on rent without him to help support her. \u201cMy wife, I cook for her, clean for her, bathe her, clothe her,\u201d he said. \u201cNow everything is on her, from the rent to the bills, everything.\u201d</p> <p>The rate of drug arrests varies widely by state, although data indicates that non-marijuana drug use is largely consistent throughout the country.</p> <p>As with other areas of the criminal justice system, arrest data for personal drug crimes shows a sharp racial disparity. According to the report\u2019s findings, black adults are two and a half times as likely as white adults to be arrested for drug possession. Borden said the report was unable to analyze any disparities in arrest rates for Latinos because the FBI does not track data for Latinos arrested. </p> <p>Other <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/apr/21/un-special-session-global-drug-policy-failure-critics-say\">policy experts</a> and international groups, including the <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/07/23/who-drug-decriminalization_n_5606609.html\">World Health Organization</a>, have called for the complete decriminalization of personal drug use. Several states have already decriminalized marijuana, with five more set to vote on the issue in November. Borden said the organizations\u2019 call for complete decriminalization \u201ctakes the mainstream drug conversation a step further\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ve driven drug use underground with criminalization and we\u2019ve failed to provide communities who are dealing and struggling with dependence issues the help and the treatment that they have a right to,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Arrest data also indicates that people charged with drug possessions are often carrying just trace amounts of an illicit substance, according to the report. </p> <p>Among the other case studies highlighted by Borden is that of Matthew Russell, who was arrested in Texas for an amount of methamphetamines so small that the lab technician described it as a \u201ctrace\u201d amount and couldn\u2019t give the amount a precise measurement.</p> <p>In March Russell, who maintains his innocence, faced 20 years for the possession charges because of previous felony convictions. Russell, who also used a pseudonym, said the previous convictions were also related to his drug dependence.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m so stressed out that some days it almost makes me want to kill myself \u2026 [20 years,] that scares me,\u201d he told Human Rights Watch.<br></p> <p>In August, Russell was sentenced to 15 years in prison.</p>",

The TPLF, its cronies, party loyalists and their families control more than 70% of the modern economy, including communications, transport, agriculture and the defence industry. Key political institutions, including defence, intelligence and foreign affairs, are similarly owned and operated by and for the benefit of the ruling ethnic clique, with as many as 98% of the top echelons of the military and security forces being staffed by ethnic Tigrayans.</p> <p>In a word, the TPLF owns the government. Although the federal constitution was designed to empower the major ethnic groups of the country to form their own states as the main framework for their governance, none of the member states (with the sole exception of Tigray) have any real powers to take care of its internal affairs.</p> <p>As a consequence, the Oromo and Amhara ethnic groups \u2013 who together constitute close to 70% of the population \u2013 are deeply resentful about playing second fiddle. Naturally, this has been a deep source of political disaffection for vast numbers of the members of these communities.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0e1c752aaa864933f26759bfc805ee8ea7abc3fe\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0e1c752aaa864933f26759bfc805ee8ea7abc3fe/0_0_5400_3469/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Members of the Ethiopian army patrol the streets of Addis Ababa.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"642\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Freedom of assembly and association are guaranteed by the constitution but they remain a dead letter in practice.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Karel Prinsloo/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>At the same time, the ethnically based federal system has left minorities trapped in their respective regions. They are treated as second-class citizens, lacking access to education, civil service employment, business licenses, bank loans and land leases on a nondiscriminatory basis. Even worse, they are liable to be expelled from regions in which they are considered \u201coutsiders\u201d.</p> <p>This has particularly been the fate of the Amhara, <a href=\"https://ethiopiaobservatory.com/2013/12/12/hrc-confirms-abuses-against-expelled-amharas-in-benishangul-gumuz/\" title=\"\">who have faced mass killing</a> at various times since the current government came to power. Yet the central authorities have shown no willingness to take protective measures or to provide any legal redress for these minorities.</p> <p>Compounding the problems thrown up by ethnic division is endemic corruption. Ethiopia ranks <a href=\"http://www.transparency.org/country/#ETH\" title=\"\">103 out of 168 countries</a> on Transparency International\u2019s corruption perceptions index, a global civil society coalition that encourages accountability. It has also lost about $25bn since 2000 to illicit financial outflows, according to Global Financial Integrity.</p> <p>Government officials and party loyalists receive preferential access to credit, land leases and jobs. Areas vulnerable to corruption are land administration, tax and revenue, the justice system, telecommunications, land procurement, licensing areas, and the finance sector.</p> <p>Particularly egregious is the government\u2019s practice of leasing large <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/mar/21/ethiopia-centre-global-farmland-rush\" title=\"\">tracts of land</a> to foreign governments and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2014/nov/10/ethiopia-pastoralists-foreign-investors-land\" title=\"\">local investors in opaque deals</a> that have displaced thousands of people. Also disconcerting is the fact that 50% of the modern economy is controlled by conglomerates affiliated with the ruling party.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/24/olympic-medallist-feyisa-lilesa-ethiopia-oroma\">Olympic medallist Feyisa Lilesa\u2019s gesture was a plea for justice for his people | Henok Gabisa</a> </p> </aside>  <p>A further factor fuelling the protests in Ethiopia is youth unemployment and the sense of hopelessness it has engendered. In recent years, the country has been producing thousands of college and university graduates each year but only a limited number are able to obtain productive employment. A sizable number often risk their lives to brave the Sahara desert and Mediterranean Sea in a desperate search for better opportunities. Others remain unemployed for long periods or are engaged in cutting cobblestones for streets.</p> <p>Freedom of assembly and association are guaranteed by the constitution but they remain a dead letter in practice. The government often resorts to its anti-terrorism law to stifle political dissent and to terrorise its political opponents. The judiciary is officially independent but in practice it rarely deviates from government policy. As of 2014, Ethiopia holds the second highest number of journalists behind bars.</p> <p>The TPLF-government has to be held to account. The donor communities, particularly the UK, the US and the EU, should stand with the Ethiopian people by ceasing all military, financial and diplomatic support to the tyrannical government, supporting instead the opposition\u2019s call for an all-inclusive transitional process to replace the current government.</p>",

If this is how the House of Commons deliberates on emergencies, it\u2019s a shame for issues less urgent than live genocide.</p> <p>Nevertheless, one would have hoped that quality would trump quantity, even with the expectation that the devil\u2019s advocates would go out of their way to absolve criminals from responsibility for the carnage in Syria. Indeed, since <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/sep/02/ed-miliband-syria-strike\">Ed Miliband\u2019s shameful posturing</a> after the August 2013 chemical massacre, most Labour MPs continue to disgrace themselves by refusing to denounce Assad\u2019s \u2013 let alone Russia\u2019s \u2013 massively documented war crimes.

When the US bombed an al-Qaida camp in northeast Syria in 2008, Assad closed down the American School of Damascus and ordered demonstrations - because that will show them.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/apr/25/tories-vote-against-accepting-3000-child-refugees\">Labour says 'fight will go on' after Tories vote down child refugee plan</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Many Syrians were crushed when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/apr/25/tories-vote-against-accepting-3000-child-refugees\">MPs voted to deny a small Kindertransport for a mere 3,000 unaccompanied children</a>. As pitiful a spectacle as that debate was, it left some feeble hope that Britain would strive to do more to protect these Syrian children\u2019s lives, precisely so they wouldn\u2019t need to seek shelter elsewhere. That hope dissipates with every empty declaration reassuring Assad and his allies that nothing, absolutely nothing, will be done to halt their aggression.</p> <p>All that remains to complete this theatre of the absurd is for Johnson to suggest that people organise candle-lit vigils while singing Kumbaya to help the people of Syria.

It is possible that Putin might refuse but this would leave Russia isolated, condemned by the world community and severely weakened in terms of prestige and influence. Even Putin is unlikely to want that. If he agrees, Assad won\u2019t want to be left out in cold. He, too, is likely to reluctantly comply.</p> <p>This civilian protection plan may or may not work. Civilians could die in the process of its implementation but many more will continue to die if there is no halt to the Assad-Putin bombing campaign. We must try.</p> <h2><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/lindsey-german\">Lindsey German</a>: The answer is not more war</h2> <p>Every time there is a debate about war in the House of Commons, it is as if we are starting from a blank sheet. Tuesday\u2019s debate was no exception. There was little to suggest that over the past few months alone there have been three separate official reports \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/jul/06/chilcot-report-crushing-verdict-tony-blair-iraq-war\">Chilcot</a>, and select committee reports on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/14/mps-deliver-damning-verdict-on-camerons-libya-intervention\">Libya</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/dec/01/cameron-has-failed-to-justify-syria-airstrikes-mps-committee-says\">Syria</a> \u2013 which have been extremely critical of two recent prime ministers, Tony Blair and David Cameron, and damning about the interventions originally cheered through in parliament. Anne Clwyd, who along with Boris Johnson wants 2 million on the streets outside the Russian embassy, was one of the main cheerleaders of the Iraq war, at a time when 2 million were marching against it.</p> <p>On each occasion there is a drive to war we are told something must be done. But the answer to the misery of the people of Aleppo is not more war, more bombing, more military intervention. It is not a no-fly zone, which in fact entails military intervention. A <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/mar/30/libya-conflict-reactions-world\">no-fly zone was the prelude to a bombing war in Libya</a> where <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/oct/26/libya-war-saving-lives-catastrophic-failure\">30,000 people died</a> and where there is still a civil war raging more than five years later. All that this will bring to the people of Aleppo is more suffering. It also risks escalating into a much worse war than even that we are seeing at present.</p> <p>The call to demonstrate outside the Russian embassy is the sort of debating point which may go down well in the Oxford Union. I would suggest that sympathy for the plight of Aleppo is not likely to be mobilised by such calls, given that much public opinion is rightly sceptical of these successive failed wars. But Johnson does nothing to address the very complex and dangerous situation in a country which is being bombed by Russia, Syria, Turkey, the US, the UK and Saudi Arabia. If we want to help the people of Aleppo we must condemn all the bombing, demand an immediate ceasefire and the withdrawal of all outside intervention. We should also demand entry into Europe for all Syrian refugees, and the end to the inhuman treatment of them by EU governments, including our own. Those are some things that really could be done to help end this war.</p>",

The exchange between Fallon and the individual at the DoJ occurred two months before the FBI opened its probe into Clinton\u2019s emails, and it pertained to information that was publicly available. </p> <p>There is no evidence that the DoJ communicated with Fallon on the email investigation.</p> <p>Speaking to reporters aboard Clinton\u2019s campaign plane on Tuesday, Podesta blamed Russian intelligence officials intent on undermining the Democratic nominee. </p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve been involved in politics for nearly five decades,\u201d Podesta told reporters. \u201cThis definitely is the first campaign that I\u2019ve been involved with in which I\u2019ve had to tangle with Russian intelligence agencies \u2026 who seem to be doing everything that they can on behalf of our opponent.\u201d Podesta did not confirm the veracity of the leaks. </p> <p>Ahead of the Florida rally, Trump lashed out at the speaker of the House, Paul Ryan, who this week announced he would no longer defend Trump or campaign with him although he <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/10/paul-ryan-ends-support-trump-campaign-endorsement-republicans\">stopped short of formally withdrawing his support for the nominee</a>. </p> <p>\u201cThey\u2019re not giving support \u2013 they don\u2019t give the support that we really need \u2013 but the fact is that I think we should get support and we don\u2019t get the support from guys like Paul Ryan,\u201d Trump told Fox News host Bill O\u2019Reilly on Tuesday. \u201c[Ryan] had a conference call with congressmen, with hundreds of them, and they practically rioted against him on the phone. One person stuck up for him.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd I don\u2019t really want his support,\u201d Trump added of Ryan. </p> <p>O\u2019Reilly asked Trump to elaborate on his earlier tweet in which he wrote that it was \u201cso nice that the shackles have been taken off me\u201d.<strong> </strong></p> <p>Trump said the shackles represented some of \u201cestablishment people, the weak and ineffective people within the party\u201d. When O\u2019Reilly asked if \u201cthrowing off of the shackles\u201d meant that he would become more outspoken, Trump forcefully denied that he was outspoken.</p> <p>He also denied polling that shows him losing support among women, a group he had trouble appealing to even before the release of video in which he boasted about touching women without consequence because of his fame. He has dismissed the remarks as \u201clocker room talk\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cMost people have heard it before, and I\u2019ve had a lot of women come up to me and say I\u2019ve heard that before, and I\u2019ve heard a lot worse,\u201d Trump told O\u2019Reilly. \u201cIf that\u2019s what it takes to lose an election, I think that\u2019d be pretty sad.\u201d</p> <p>With less than one month left until election day, Trump is under pressure from party leadership and his own supporters to hone his attack strategy and stick to it. His campaign has so far proved resilient despite not having a conventional fundraising structure or voter outreach plan. </p> <p>During the speech in Florida\u2019s conservative panhandle, Trump encouraged the crowd to register to vote. He noted that the voter registration deadline in Florida had been extended because of the hurricane, which interrupted the state\u2019s final registration days. </p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a movement. But if we don\u2019t win, all it is a little asterisk in history,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThere\u2019s never been anything like this. So go and register. Make sure you get out and vote. November 28th.\u201d The US election is on 8 November. </p>",

  "<p>In the grim scheme of things, it is the modesty of the sum that gets you. With the formal backing of the Netherlands Trade Union Confederation, a Bangladeshi man named Nadim Sharaful Alam <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/oct/10/fifa-faces-legal-challenge-over-qatar-migrant-workers-world-cup-2022\" title=\"\">is to sue Fifa</a> for its alleged complicity in the mistreatment of those migrant workers in Qatar who are charged with building its World Cup venues and infrastructure. (Suggested tournament slogan: \u201cBelieve The Mirage\u2122\u201d.)</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/oct/10/fifa-faces-legal-challenge-over-qatar-migrant-workers-world-cup-2022\">Fifa faces legal challenge over Qatar migrant workers</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In what amounts to a test case, Alam is threatening to sue world football\u2019s governing body via the Swiss courts unless Fifa settles with him. According to the legal argument presented in the writ of summons to Fifa, the governing body \u201chas violated applicable legal standards under Swiss law protecting migrant workers from forced labour and other forms of exploitation\u201d. For \u201cthe hardships that he endured\u201d while Building The Dream\u2122, Alam is asking for the equivalent of $5,000. For material damages compensation, just under the same sum again.</p> <p>So what does 10 grand buy you in Alam\u2019s world? His case is that in 2014, the then 29-year-old paid the equivalent of $4,000 \u201con account\u201d to a recruiter who led him to understand that a construction firm had sponsored him and he was to be employed as an unskilled labourer. Under the less rosy realities of the country\u2019s forced-labour kafala system, Alam\u2019s passport was taken from him and he was forced to work 18-hour days for nearly a year and a half. During what we\u2019ll sarcastically call his downtime, he was confined to a World Cup workers\u2019 camp, where he was naturally required to pay for his meals. In a cute and doubtless entirely coincidental instance of timing, he was fired before he had \u201crepaid\u201d his recruitment fee, whereupon he was deported penniless back to Bangladesh. He had mortgaged his land back home to pay the initial instalment to the recruiter, and is now unable to pay the debt.</p> <p>As I say, that little jolly consumed 17 backbreaking and cruelly fruitless months of Alam\u2019s existence. In contrast, let us consider the figures attached to a mere four days \u2013 four days! \u2013 in the life of Gianni Infantino, the Solomon Grundy of a Fifa president who was appointed on a Monday and embroiled in an ethics investigation by the Tuesday, before being cleared on the Wednesday. I paraphrase only slightly. Still, what does 10 grand buy you in the world of the chap who will undoubtedly bat away Alam\u2019s request for compensation, <em>pour encourager les autres</em>?</p> <p>Let us examine a single document in the now-settled ethics case against the Fifa president, concerning his use of private jets. According to this letter to the ethics committee, despite Fifa having booked him commercial flights between Geneva, Moscow, Doha, and Zurich over four days in April, Infantino rejected these in favour of accepting private jet flights paid for by Russia and Qatar. \u201cThe total value of the private jet invitations are in a range of at least approx $115,000 to $150,000,\u201d the letter states, \u201cdepending on aircraft and ferry-flights, even more.\u201d Needless to say, this does not include standard Fifa expenses such as hotel rooms, cars, dinners and other sundries. Unlike Alam, for instance, I imagine the Fifa president likes his Doha water bottled, rather than dispensed by a desert standpipe.</p> <p>Ah well. There are always two different World Cups. When Fifa bigwigs blather on about any tournament, you can always predict exactly which version of it is going to turn up. Either the World Cup pretty much has the power to heal the planet and is an incredibly transformative thing \u2013 which is why you increasingly have to award it to non-democracies. Or it is only a game, and really can\u2019t be held accountable for whatever it is you\u2019ve discovered is being done in its name, even if it profits you obscenely. I don\u2019t want to go out on a limb here, but which version do we imagine Infantino falls back on when he tells Alam and his modest plea to do one?</p> <h2><strong>Lockered out</strong><br></h2> <p>Like all women, I am shocked by the idea that either Donald Trump or Nigel Farage has been inside a \u201clocker room\u201d inside the past two decades \u2013 or even since school. Indeed, each time I consider these chaps\u2019 assured mention of the \u201clocker room\u201d, I find my mind wandering to the inevitable. Which is (but of course): what sport would Nigel and Donald have been playing just before the sexual-assault-reminiscences warmdown?</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/10/donald-trump-locker-room-banter-athletes-reaction\">Athletes on Trump's 'locker room banter': that's not how we talk at work</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Is there anything more preposterous than the notion of Trump playing even a bit of pitch and putt with little Barron, before losing interest and offloading it to the help? The idea of The Donald playing any form of sport is almost more bonkers than the idea of him being leader of the free world.</p> <p>I am reminded of an oblique remark made by his own devoted former butler, shortly after he\u2019d shown a reporter the sensationally bad portrait of his boss in costume cricket whites in the library bar of his Floridian estate. To wit: \u201cMr Trump rarely appears in bathing trunks.\u201d</p> <p>If I really stretch my imagination, I can just about picture both Nigel and Donald playing racketball incredibly angrily and atrociously for around three minutes, Farage in black office socks with white plimsolls, and Trump with those mid-calf efforts and trainers with a wide heel flare recommended by the American Orthotics Association.</p> <p>But really, two less credible denizens of a locker room I can scarcely contemplate. I assume there is already a horrendously niche strain of slash fiction devoted to what happens when these two finish chuckling about pussy-grabbing and head for the showers. But it is surely best left to the alt-right completists.</p>",
  "<p>Thanks to a blistering defensive performance from 33-year-old Silver Fern Anna Harrison \u2013 who hassled, harangued and intimidated Diamonds\u2019 goaling superstar Caitlin Bassett \u2013 and a mammoth effort in defence, New Zealand beat Australia 53-51 in game two of the Constellation Cup in Launceston, to tie the series one-all. </p> <p>Harrison, 24-year-old Te Paea Selby-Rickit, playing in just her sixth international for her country, and midcourter Grace Rasmussen, were instrumental in the two-goal win in front of a sell-out crowd of 3,000 international netball-starved fans at the Silverdome, that ties the series with games left to play in Auckland and Invercargill. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/oct/09/caitlin-bassett-leads-diamonds-masterclass-against-silver-ferns\">Caitlin Bassett leads Diamonds masterclass against Silver Ferns</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The Australians won Sunday\u2019s first Test in Sydney 68-56, with Bassett recording a perfect game, scoring 47 from as many attempts in just three quarters, but she went from hero to quasi-villain on the Apple Isle. Although she still sunk 41 goals \u2013 from 43 attempts \u2013 the 193cm 28-year-old Sunshine Lightning recruit dropped crucial balls and gave away penalties.<br></p> <p>Playing in Launceston for the first time in 27 years, the Diamonds couldn\u2019t find their Sydney form, across the court and from the opening whistle. Bassett made an error on the first phase of play \u2013 and it set the tone for the match.<br></p> <p>Harrison, who has come back to international netball after having two children, was unlucky to not get best-on court \u2013 which went to Rasmussen \u2013 after picking up five crucial intercepts, 11 deflections and two rebounds on the normally-dominant Bassett.<br></p> <p>Diamonds coach Lisa Alexander went back to what most consider her \u201ctop line\u201d starting seven, combining Bassett with her now ex-West Coast Fever team-mate, the veteran Nat Medhurst, who in making her 85<sup>th</sup> international appearance became the seventh most capped Australian netballer of all time.<br></p> <p>In Sydney, Alexander went with Gretel Tippett \u2013 who scored just three goals from four attempts \u2013 and she had to settle for a place on the bench in Tasmania before coming on to replace Medhurst in the third quarter.<br></p> <p>Collingwood recruits Kim Ravaillion, at centre, and Madi Robinson, at wing attack, were the midcourt engine room again, while Sharni Layton and Clare McMeniman combined once again in defence, with Gabi Simpson at wing defence.</p> <p>After a shaky few first minutes \u2013 during which Bassett dropped balls and failed to find her usual space in the circle against Harrison \u2013 the Diamonds settled care of a McMeniman tip, then an intercept from Layton.<br></p> <p>The Diamonds pulled away to a 6-1 lead early in the first, but the Kiwis fired back and reeled in the lead, thanks to 100% shooting from Mes (6/6), at goal shooter and Selby-Rickit (5/5), who started at goal attack.<br></p> <p>Both shooting combinations shone; with only Medhurst missing (3/4) in the quarter. Bassett knocked down 12 from 12 and the opening stanza finished 15-11 Australia\u2019s way.<br></p> <p>Basic skill errors and turnovers in the attack end hurt the Diamonds in the second quarter. So too did Mes, who distracted Layton with plenty of physical play and shot 11 goals from 13 attempts to take her game total to 17 from 19.<br></p> <p>Selby-Rickit continued on her merry way, shooting seven from seven to maintain a clean sheet for the match.<br></p> <p>Just after the six-minute mark, the Kiwis went on a four-goal run to bring the score back to 23-20.<br></p> <p>Some untidiness in the Diamonds\u2019 circle and cool heads in the Ferns\u2019 saw the scores level at 27-27 with just a few minutes remaining. It went goal for goal for the last few minutes and an uncharacteristic offensive contact from Bassett saw Selby-Rickit shoot her side\u2019s last goal, to make it 29-28. Bassett redeemed herself with a shot after the whistle, care of a penalty, to tie it up 28-28 at half-time.<br></p> <p>Silver Ferns coach Janine Southby kept her line-up unchanged after the break, while Alexander put April Brandley into goal defence, moved McMeniman to wing defence and benched Simpson. It all started to fall apart for the Diamonds in the third, scoring just three goals in seven minutes. Tippett came on for Medhurst and had an immediate impact, with a number of vital tips and intercepts, but Harrison continued to make a nuisance of herself.<br></p> <p>Although she was starring, Southby benched Selby-Rickit, putting Ameliaranne Ekenasio to goal attack. The change was seamless and with the Diamonds struggling to capitalise on turnovers, the quarter finished with the Ferns up, 42-40.<br></p> <p>The Diamonds started the last with a bang, going on a three-goal run, but it wasn\u2019t enough. The inconsistency that had plagued them all night remained and cool heads prevailed. </p> <p>Those cool heads belonged to the Silver Ferns on the night and in particular to Mes, who finished with 32 from 34, and Selby-Rickit with 17 form 21.</p>",
  "<p>\u201cWhen I walk out of the office, people are maybe not expecting a woman,\u201d says Megan Barry, when I ask whether she has experienced sexism since being elected mayor of Nashville, Tennessee, just over a year ago. \u201cYou can see the surprise in their eyes: \u2018Oh, ha!

But there are plenty who pour cold water on the idea that where one leads, others will follow, or that the election of a first female mayor \u2013 or indeed a first woman as a country\u2019s president or prime minister \u2013 changes anything much. </p> <p>Ulrik Kjaer, professor of political science at the University of Southern Denmark, says recent Scandinavian political history justifies such doubts. While Denmark has had its first female prime minister, and the sexes are widely seen to be more equal there than almost anywhere else, the percentage of female mayors in the country has not risen above 15%.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Women still have a very hard time being accepted as political leaders, especially in local politics.</p> <footer> <cite>Ulrik Kjaer, professor of political science</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cSince we have already some women mayors and we\u2019ve had a female PM, we tend to tick off gender \u2013 \u2018OK, we\u2019re done with that, we\u2019ve reached some kind of parity\u2019 \u2013 and focus on other under-represented groups, immigrants and young people and so on ... when in fact gender parity has not been reached,\u201d he says. \u201cWomen still have a very hard time being accepted as political leaders, especially in local politics.\u201d</p> <p>Debbie Walsh, director of the Center for American Women and Politics, echoes this. She says <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/28/hillary-clinton-sexism-millennial-voters-women\">Hillary Clinton\u2019s run for US president</a> creates the \u201cfalse impression that women have really made it in politics. If she wins it will be enormously significant but it masks the reality. We\u2019re not anticipating a year of great strides. We might get from 19% women in the House of Representatives to 20%. State legislatures are not particularly great, and at governor level there are only six women [out of 50].\u201d</p> <p>Walsh believes the women with positions in American politics are, on the whole, more moderate, because women are more economically vulnerable than men, and see themselves as more likely to need state help. But she adds that partisan pulls have recently become stronger. </p> <p>She points to a lack of research into local government internationally as one problem confronting anyone trying to understand what impact, if any, women legislators make. She also notes that the jobs of mayor or governor pose particular challenges, because the stereotype of the good female politician is of a skilful group or committee worker, not a charismatic boss.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b694f089511bb360fb7944bc939ac4be2abb6d29\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b694f089511bb360fb7944bc939ac4be2abb6d29/0_384_3459_2076/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Mayor of Watford Dorothy Thornhill speaks to Nick Clegg and project managers during a visit to the construction site for the Watford Health Campus.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The mayor of Watford, Dorothy Thornhill, speaks to Nick Clegg and construction managers at Watford Health Campus.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Steve Parsons/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p> This point is echoed by Dorothy Thornhill, mayor of Watford in England for the past 14 years, and one of just <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/feb/03/where-women-council-leaders-northern-powerhouse-english-regions\">four directly elected English female mayors</a>. \u201cPeople think leadership equals male characteristics,\u201d she says. \u201cThe idea that you have to be this macho-type of person is still around.\u201d As mayor, she has played against this type, and cheerfully reports how on a school visit a child shouted out, \u201cYou ain\u2019t no mayor!

But having once been a sceptic, she now believes directly elected mayors are the future of local government, not just in the UK where a handful of powerful new city-region mayors are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/aug/09/labour-announce-candidates-mayor-greater-manchester-west-midlands\">due to be elected next year</a>, but internationally.</p> <p>Last year the thinktank LGIU and Fawcett Society <a href=\"http://www.lgiu.org.uk/project/commission-on-women-in-local-government/\">launched a Commission on Women in Local Government</a>. If this aims to fill in gaps in knowledge of what is going on in the UK, evidence on the impact of female mayors globally looks set to remain hard-to-come-by for some time. </p> <p>\u201cYou see a woman\u2019s body and you see a feminist outcome, but a woman\u2019s body might not have a feminist mind,\u201d says Sarah Childs, professor of politics and gender at Bristol University. While the election of a woman mayor can signal a desire for change, or rejection of the status quo \u2013 the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/20/rome-mayoral-crisis-could-hurt-five-stars-national-chances-italy-virginia-raggi\">mayors of Rome and Turin</a> are both from Beppe Grillo\u2019s anti-establishment Five Star Movement, while those <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/26/ada-colau-barcelona-most-radical-mayor-in-the-world\">in Barcelona</a> and Madrid are leftists \u2013 it is hard to draw any firm conclusions about what this might mean for women longer-term.</p> <p>One influential aspect, however, is that these female leaders are showing a younger generation of girls what is possible. \u201cNot too long ago I was in a parade, and somebody shouted, \u2018Here comes the mayor!\u2019\u201d says Megan Barry. \u201cThree little girls on a stoop looked up and one of them said, \u2018Which one is he?\u2019 so I got to walk over and say, \u2018Actually it\u2019s me,\u2019 and she replied, \u2018You mean a girl can be mayor?\u2019\u201d</p> <p>But while not every woman mayor is a feminist with the specific goal of improving the lives of women in their city, it is still the case that women bring with them a set of experiences different in important ways from those of many of their male peers. \u201cIf you\u2019ve never tried to put a buggy on a bus, you don\u2019t really understand what many women\u2019s experience of public transport is,\u201d Childs says, adding that there\u2019s a burgeoning argument for childcare to be thought about as infrastructure \u2013 not just roads and rail.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"4af7b62cea7a70bca7bae19704e01fa8b0bf802b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4af7b62cea7a70bca7bae19704e01fa8b0bf802b/610_0_2800_1681/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Cologne\u2019s chief of police Juergen Mathies and mayor Henriette Reker announce the city\u2019s security plans for New Year\u2019s Eve 2016.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Cologne\u2019s chief of police, Juergen Mathies, and mayor, Henriette Reker.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rolf Vennebernd/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Sexual violence and harassment are another reason women and girls experience cities differently from men.

Following the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jan/05/germany-crisis-cologne-new-years-eve-sex-attacks\">sex attacks in the city at New Year</a>, when almost 500 sexual assaults were reported, Reker was lambasted for her remarks about keeping strange men at arm\u2019s length, which were interpreted as \u201cvictim-blaming\u201d. She <a href=\"https://monocle.com/magazine/issues/96/light-in-the-dark/\">has since said</a> she thinks her words were a subconscious reflection of her own trauma. When I ask what lessons she took from New Year, she says the attacks are \u201cstill very much present in our heads\u201d.</p> <p>Ana Olivera, until last year mayor of Montevideo, capital of Uruguay, is another mayor to have focused attention on violence against women, by offering psychological therapy to survivors of sexual violence. But she describes rights for women as part of a larger struggle that includes racial equality and LGBT inclusion: \u201cI don\u2019t see women\u2019s interests as a trade-off against the interests of other groups.\u201d </p> <p>On the contrary, supporters of women\u2019s representation in politics believe women can act as a kind of bridgehead for other under-represented groups \u2013 older people, children, racial and religious minorities \u2013 because although women are not a minority, they are more likely than men to have experienced social exclusion and disempowerment. Olivera names among her proudest achievements as Montevideo mayor a skate park, proposed by a group of teenage skateboarders who won approval and a budget from the city.</p> <p>If a couple of themes recur in talking to female mayors, one is that they have often been underestimated, if not insulted; another is their sense that women can bring a different, less overtly combative and more consensual approach to government. Also, there is their pride at having blazed a trail. </p> <h2>Female mayors in their own words</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"c690300d5b38a5e15f20fcfc03be9f79caa592f0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c690300d5b38a5e15f20fcfc03be9f79caa592f0/0_27_477_596/400.jpg\" alt=\"Cyvette Gibson\" width=\"400\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Cyvette Gibson</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Cyvette Gibson</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Cyvette Gibson, Paynesville, Liberia (population 347,000)</strong></p> <p>\u201cIn parts of Africa there are still prejudices about women in leadership roles and doubts about the impact we can make.

Privacy and security experts, however, point out that the history of US counterintelligence debacles is a story replete with risks from agency employees, such as the FBI\u2019s Robert Hanssen and the CIA\u2019s Aldrich Ames. </p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t think that private contractors are necessary more of a security risk than government employees,\u201d said Jennifer Granick of Stanford law school\u2019s Center for Internet and Society. As an attorney, Granick noted, preparation of court materials \u201coften entails a lot of mundane stuff that\u2019s not substantive.\u201d </p> <p>But a congressional aide, who was not cleared to speak for the record, considered the FBI contract bizarre. </p> <p> \u201cIt is very odd to me anybody on outside government would be responsible for building the binder of Fisa materials and couriering it to place to place,\u201d the staffer said. </p> <p>Steven Aftergood, an intelligence specialist with the Federation of American Scientists, called the Aveshka contract a \u201csign of the times\u201d, as private firms are increasingly enmeshed in the most sensitive national-security functions the government performs. </p> <p>\u201cBy definition, this introduces some new vulnerabilities. Contractors, who are driven by a profit motive, will often provide superior service. But they may also cut corners in the name of efficiency that should not be cut,\u201d Aftergood said. </p> <p>Martin, the Aveshka vice-president, did not respond to additional requests for information on the FBI contract.

  "<p>UK police forces are failing victims of modern slavery by not recording what happens to them as crimes, meaning many cases are never investigated, the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/independent-anti-slavery-commissioner\" draggable=\"true\">independent anti-slavery commissioner</a> has said in his first annual report.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Kevin Hyland, whose job was created under last year\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2015/30/contents/enacted\">Modern Slavery Act</a>, said just over a quarter of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2016/jul/10/modern-slavery-on-rise-in-uk\" draggable=\"true\">3,000-plus slavery cases</a> identified in England and Wales last year under the <a href=\"http://www.nationalcrimeagency.gov.uk/about-us/what-we-do/specialist-capabilities/uk-human-trafficking-centre/national-referral-mechanism\" draggable=\"true\">national referral mechanism</a> (NRM) for recording the offence resulted in crimes recorded by police.</p> <p>The situation was similarly bad in Scotland, Hyland noted in his report, although the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) logged every one of the offences referred to it.</p> <p>This meant too many police forces were failing victims, Hyland said. \u201cWhen NRM referrals are not recorded as crimes, investigations are not launched and victims do not receive the justice and support that they both need and deserve.\u201d</p> <p>The report identified some areas in which anti-slavery procedures had improved but said a series of other areas needed improvement and there were \u201ctoo many gaps in the system for victims to fall through\u201d, especially once they left supported accommodation.</p> <p>Hyland\u2019s biggest concern was the failure by police to properly record slavery referrals. Among English and Welsh forces, he found, 3,146 NRM referrals brought just 884 recordings of slavery crimes, or 28% of the total. This amounted to \u201cchronic weaknesses\u201d in recording the crime, Hyland said.</p> <p>More than half of the English and Welsh forces had difficulties answering whether any referrals via the NRM had resulted in a crime record, while four could not find their internal records about NRM cases.</p> <p>In Scotland the situation was, if anything, worse, the report found, with police forces having a policy \u2013 since changed \u2013 that slavery crimes would only be recorded if there were \u201cconclusive grounds\u201d connected to the NRM. In contrast, the PSNI logged 100% of NRM referrals in 2015-16.</p> <p>Matters were not all bad, Hyland said. In the foreword to the report, he wrote: \u201cEvidence I have collected does demonstrate that some UK police forces are taking a proactive approach to combating modern slavery through the development of bespoke units, quality assurance mechanisms and training.\u201d<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>He added: \u201cI am disappointed, however, that many instances of substandard modern slavery crime recording remain.\u201d <br></p> <p>Hyland said he had raised the issue with the National Crime Agency and the National Police Chiefs\u2019 Council.</p> <p>Shaun Sawyer, who leads on anti-slavery for the NPCC, said police wanted to do more to tackle the \u201cvile crime\u201d. </p> <p>\u201cThis complex and cross-border-type offence presents the police with unique challenges,\u201d he said. \u201cHowever, it does not excuse the gap between national referrals and recorded crime in some areas. We also believe there are many victims of modern slavery who are yet to be identified.\u201d </p> <p>In a statement following the report, Theresa May said the government was committed to tackling the issue.<br></p> <p>\u201cSo let us send out this message,\u201d the prime minister said. \u201cTo the victims of modern slavery: we will not ignore your plight. We will not turn away. We will not shut our eyes and pretend your suffering does not exist.</p> <p>\u201cWe will work tirelessly, relentlessly pursuing the perpetrators of these appalling crimes so that victims of slavery can go free. And my message to these criminals is simply this: we are coming after you.\u201d</p> <p>According to the report, there are believed to be up to 13,000 victims of modern slavery currently in the UK, including domestic slaves, forced agricultural workers and people exploited in brothels.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Hyland said a visit to Italy and Greece this year had uncovered \u201cstrong evidence that the migration crisis is being used by human trafficking networks to target and exploit the most vulnerable, and that there is a need for urgent action\u201d.</p> <p>Hyland also noted concerns about the potential numbers of women and girls trafficked from Nigeria for sexual slavery.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>In 2015, more than 5,600 Nigerian women and girls arrived in Italy by sea, almost four times as many as in 2014, the report said. The majority of these came from the Nigerian state of Edo.</p> <p>Hyland also highlighted the issue of homeless people being exploited by traffickers for what is described as work in the informal economy. He said a number of them were \u201cbeing held in exploitation and slave-like conditions across the UK\u201d. </p> <p>The report warned: \u201cAs there is currently no national evidence base or recording mechanisms for this phenomenon, and despite the best efforts of organisations working in this field, the response to date has not been effective.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Amazon has launched Amazon Music Unlimited, a competitor to Spotify and Apple Music, as part of the company\u2019s push into music streaming.</p> <p>Amazon Music Unlimited, which will initially only be available in the US, is a head-to-head competitor with Spotify, charging the same $9.99 (\u00a38.15) monthly fee as that service.

Users can ask their Echo speakers \u2013 or their smartphones running the Music Unlimited app \u2013 to play songs by simply quoting lyrics (\u201cplay me that song that goes \u2018scuse me while I kiss the sky\u2019\u201d), songs from a specific time in an artists\u2019 career (\u201cplay me Oasis songs from before 1997\u201d) or songs described by a particular adjective (\u201cPlay me happy songs\u201d).

  "<p>Thirty years ago next May, Keith Houchen stooped to conquer. A journeyman striker with Coventry City, who had nearly missed the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/that-1980s-sports-blog/2014/may/16/fa-cup-final-tottenham-coventry-classic-1987\" title=\"\">1987 FA Cup final</a> against Tottenham Hotspur because of food poisoning, Houchen scored the defining goal of the match with a diving header of acrobatic grace. It was a goal that lived on beyond that game and helped seal a glorious chapter in the history of Coventry, who lifted the Cup for the first and only time. Today fans of the beleaguered club may be forgiven for thinking it was a dream.</p> <p>Twenty years ago Coventry were a Premier League side. They were managed by Gordon Strachan, had David Burrows in defence, Gary McAllister in midfield and up front the deadly duo of Dion Dublin and Darren Huckerby. Ten years ago Coventry were in the Championship, their long run in the top flight finally at an end and with the costs of a new stadium, the Ricoh Arena, hanging around their neck. At the end of 2007, the club were bought by the hedge fund Sisu Capital.</p> <p>Now it is fair to say the club are in a state of absolute distress. Sitting at the bottom of League One with one victory in 11 games, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/29/coventry-city-manager-tony-mowbray-resigns-winless-run\" title=\"\">Tony Mowbray resigned as manager on 29 September</a>, leaving behind a group of players he called \u201cbabies in a man\u2019s league\u201d.

Sisu is blamed for a litany of faults, from a rent strike at the Ricoh Arena to the still controversial decision to temporarily move the club to Northampton, to a series of draining legal actions against Coventry city council and, most recently, an announcement that the club\u2019s training ground \u2013 the club\u2019s only substantial asset \u2013 had been included in a regional plan as a potential site for 75 new houses.</p> <p>The most pressing concerns for Coventry, beyond their league position, are twofold: what happens when the club\u2019s deal at the Ricoh Arena runs out at the end of next season and, more immediately, the continued existence of the club\u2019s Category 2 academy, the club\u2019s \u201clifeline\u201d.</p> <p>Both of these issues are complicated by the poisonous relations between Sisu and the council. It is the latter which owns the freehold on the Ricoh Arena, while another company, Arena Coventry Limited, holds the lease. In 2013 ACL was half owned by the council and half by a local charity, the Alan Higgs children\u2019s charity. It is now owned entirely by Wasps Rugby Club.</p> <p>After Sisu\u2019s decision in 2012 to withhold rent on the basis the terms were too high for a League One club, ACL fell into arrears and the council agreed to loan the company \u00a314.4m. Sisu promptly asked for a judicial review, claiming this amounted to inappropriate aid from the state. The subsequent review in the high court found in ACL\u2019s favour, with the judge also accusing Sisu of \u201cmismanagement\u201d and finding it \u201chad no strategy for maintaining a sustainable football club, except one that involved the purchase, at a knockdown price, of at least a 50% share in ACL and thus the Arena\u201d. Sisu chose to appeal and this year that bid failed as the court of appeal ruled again in ACL\u2019s favour. Sisu is now in the process of appealing once again, this time to the supreme court. Legal costs are currently thought to total more than a million pounds.</p> <p>Discussions over a new 20-year tenancy for Coventry at the Ricoh Arena have ground to a halt while the legal action continues. Meanwhile, the club are unable to guarantee a home for their academy beyond the end of this year. The system that has in recent years produced Callum Wilson and the England youngster James Maddison is temporarily housed at a local sports centre. The council appear set to hand over that land to Wasps as the site of a new training centre.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9a2d97aee13e6fec56b4e8b4efd8884bd9d08857\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9a2d97aee13e6fec56b4e8b4efd8884bd9d08857/0_54_2583_2087/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Coventry\u2019s Jodi Jones, left, during the recent Checkatrade Trophy match with Northampton.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"808\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Coventry\u2019s Jodi Jones, left, during the recent Checkatrade Trophy match with Northampton.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Pete Norton/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>When approached, Coventry city council refused to comment, while Sisu did not respond to requests for comment.</p> <p>As for the club, they remain in a parlous position. \u201cThe club and its owners find themselves in an unprecedented and extraordinary situation,\u201d a Coventry spokesman told the Guardian. \u201cA lot of our challenges stem from one fact: Coventry City does not own its own stadium. [The club are] unable to commercially benefit from sales of food and drink, parking even. It has been this way for many years and we have not been able to persuade the various stadium owners to reconsider these challenges. We would like a long-term deal that keeps the Sky Blues at the Ricoh stadium. But we have not been successful in agreeing a deal that would be economically viable for the club.\u201d</p> <p>As for the academy and training ground, Coventry had the following to say: \u201cOur academy site is now controlled by Wasps, which is keen to develop it as a training facility for its own players. For this reason, it is likely we will be looking for an alternative base to house our academy. We do, however, continue to explore alternatives with the help of the Coventry Sports Foundation \u2013 which is a partner of the city council.</p> <p>\u201cWe have no immediate plans to sell our training ground. Rugby district council is in the process of producing a strategic plan for its area, an event that happens very rarely, and so we had an opportunity to apply for a change of use in the event of a move of our training site. To be clear: we do not plan to immediately move but felt this was a prudent piece of long-term contingency planning.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/when-saturday-comes-blog/2016/oct/11/working-football-clubs-coventry-city-crystal-palace\">What two interns learned from working at football clubs \u2013\u00a0in 1989-90 and 2014-15</a> </p> </aside>  <p>What emerges from talking to people involved in this long sorry saga is a feeling of helplessness, that the club\u2019s future is beyond their control.

As yet they have had no response \u2013 but even if the will was there, any such deal would not be a panacea. The club reduced their operating losses to \u00a31.9m in their last published results but the success was largely down to cutting running costs to the bone. This includes the wage bill. Mowbray nearly got Coventry to the play-offs with a team of loanees last season but left admitting he had been unable to pull a rabbit from the hat a second time.</p> <p>\u201cA fair chunk of people have just had enough,\u201d says Mokrzycki. \u201cThey\u2019ve gone to watch other teams, or they\u2019ve gone to watch Wasps.

  "<p>A tent on a sidewalk is the only place thousands of San Franciscans have to call home.

The city would be required to offer residents of an encampment 24 hours\u2019 notice and a shelter bed or a bus ticket out of town, before being authorized to confiscate their tents and other belongings.

  "<h2>1) Strachan continues to bemuse as Burke and co left on sidelines</h2> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/oct/11/gordon-strachan-scotland-slovakia-world-cup-qualifier\">Gordon Strachan says we \u2018gave it our best shot\u2019 after Scotland defeat</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Nothing sums up what has become increasingly erratic management by Gordon Strachan better than the strange case of Oliver Burke. The supposed bright young hope of Scottish football, a \u00a313m purchase by Red Bull Leipzig, had started Scotland\u2019s games against Malta and Lithuania but wasn\u2019t even deemed worthy of a strip in a 23-man squad in Slovakia. Strachan cited \u201cexperience\u201d as key to that decision, which will puzzle every international coach who has ever blooded exciting attacking talent. Burke has an effective style which differs from others Strachan can call upon. He scares defenders, despite the inconsistency associated not only with youth but his position on the field. This wasn\u2019t an isolated case. Steven Naismith and Barrie McKay were both in the Scotland squad for the games against Lithuania and Slovakia, which fell only four days apart, but didn\u2019t even travel to the latter. Why, in that case, did Strachan bother calling them up? Scotland have widely-known issues when it comes to player ability. What they don\u2019t need is a manager supposedly incapable of clear, concise and consistent thinking when it comes to using what personnel he has at his disposal. No wonder the Tartan Army look on with an increasing sense of bemusement. <strong>EM</strong></p> <p>\u2022 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/oct/11/slovakia-scotland-world-cup-qualifier-match-report\">Match report: Slovakia 3-0 Scotland</a><br>\u2022 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/oct/04/oliver-burke-england-scotland-rb-leipzig-nottingham-forest\">Oliver Burke: \u2018England tried but I love playing for Scotland \u2013 goosebumps\u2019</a><br>\u2022 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/oct/11/gordon-strachan-scotland-slovakia-world-cup-qualifier\">Strachan says we \u2018gave it our best shot\u2019 after Scotland defeat</a></p> <h2>2) Gameiro shows France what might have been</h2> <p>After scoring 29 goals for Sevilla last season, including the equaliser in their victory over Liverpool in the Europa League final, it was no surprise that Kevin Gameiro <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/jul/30/atletico-madrid-kevin-gameiro-signs-sevilla-la-liga-france-transfer\">sealed a big move in the summer</a>. But while the striker caught the eye of Atletico Madrid\u2019s Diego Simeone, that fine judge of a player, his performances for Sevilla were not enough to convince Didier Deschamps that he was worth a place in France\u2019s Euro 2016 squad, a strange decision given how Olivier Giroud failed to impose himself in the final against Portugal. Gameiro\u2019s omission was compounded by the lack of attacking options in reserve, with Karim Benzema unavailable, Anthony Martial out of sorts and Andr\u00e9-Pierre Gignac seemingly picked for the sole purpose of making Giroud look like Usain Bolt. Now that Gameiro is back in the squad, France have been offered a glimpse of what might have been. With Giroud injured, he started and scored <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/oct/07/world-cup-2018-qualifiers-roundup-gameiro-france-bulgaria-holland\">against Bulgaria on Friday</a> before enhancing the side\u2019s fluidity in attack <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/oct/10/holland-france-world-cup-qualifier-match-report\">in Monday\u2019s win away to Holland</a>. <strong>JS<br></strong><br>\u2022 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/oct/10/holland-france-world-cup-qualifier-match-report\">France\u2019s Pogba sinks Holland as Liverpool\u2019s Wijnaldum suffers injury</a></p> <h2>3) Slovenia turn up the pressure on England</h2> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/picture/2016/oct/11/david-squires-on-gareth-southgate-and-england\">David Squires on \u2026 Gareth Southgate and England</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Of course the focus from the game in Ljubljana will be on the quality of England\u2019s performance. But one thing that was striking was not just how quickly and highly the Slovenians pressed England, but why more traditionally \u201csmaller\u201d teams don\u2019t do that more. It\u2019s not especially realistic for a team like Malta, whose players simply wouldn\u2019t have the fitness to do it properly, but very often \u2013 especially at Wembley \u2013 teams still pack their defence, sit deep and, more often than not, eventually get picked off, in qualifiers at least. One of the reasons that Slovenia should have won was that they unsettled England, forcing some mistakes and creating a sense of pressure that may have been an intangible cause of others. It shouldn\u2019t be news that England\u2019s primary problem in high-pressured situations is mental, that they panic and create a sense of chaos, particularly in defence. It\u2019s a strategy that creates its own risks, but if other managers were watching on Tuesday, we might see this approach repeated in the future. <strong>NM</strong></p> <p>\u2022 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/oct/11/slovenia-england-world-cup-qualifying-match-report\">Match report: Slovenia 0-0 England</a><br>\u2022 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/oct/11/wayne-rooney-gareth-southgate-england-failings\">Dominic Fifield: Not even Rooney can help inspire Southgate\u2019s England</a><br>\u2022 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/oct/11/gareth-southgate-england-mess-point-slovenia-joe-hart\">Southgate admits England were a \u2018mess\u2019 but hails point in Slovenia</a><br>\u2022 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/picture/2016/oct/11/david-squires-on-gareth-southgate-and-england\">David Squires on \u2026 Gareth Southgate and England</a><br>\u2022 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/oct/11/tammy-abraham-england-under-21s-bosnia-herzegovina\">Abraham scores twice in full debut for England Under-21s</a></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/video/2016/oct/12/gareth-southgate-joe-hart-england-slovenia-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/575ec\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2799021\"            data-video-name=\"Southgate praises Hart after England draw with Slovenia \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"SNTV\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-57fe03e3e4b03b22b4fb27ea\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"http://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=11951883&amp;format=video/mp4\"/><source src=\"http://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=11951883&amp;format=video/m3u8\"/><source src=\"http://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=11951883&amp;format=video/webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/video/2016/oct/12/gareth-southgate-joe-hart-england-slovenia-video\">Southgate praises Hart after England draw with Slovenia</a></figcaption> </figure>   <h2>4) Andorra make a strong case for introducing preliminary rounds</h2> <p>If Andorra do not become more careful, they could change the rules of European qualifiers by bringing about the introduction of a preliminary stage for minnows. The current principle that big countries should play with even the smallest ones is good. It has even delivered occasional entertainment, as although non-contests are not much of a spectacle, supposed mis-matches have led to some memorable moments down the years: Liechtenstein\u2019s 0-0 draw with the Republic of Ireland in 1995 held a special kind of fascination, and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGdQvqbIexk\">San Marino\u2019s goal after 8.3 seconds against England in 1993 was very funny</a>. But Andorra\u2019s base and stupid <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/oct/07/portugal-andorra-world-cup-2018-qualifier-cristiano-ronaldo\">performance against Portugal</a> last Friday soured natural goodwill towards the underdog. They tackled with a vicious recklessness that raised doubts about their worthiness to be on the same pitch as players with whom they apparently could not compete fairly. They were lucky to have only two players sent off, and the European champions were lucky to escape serious injury. Happily, the Faroe Islands put forward a much better case for inclusiveness, as they showcased their continued improvement by winning in Latvia while Andorra were misbehaving in Portugal. The Faroes then hosted the European champions and played some creditable stuff despite losing by the same 6-0 scoreline as Andorra. And hats off to San Marino for going to Norway and scoring in an away match for the first time in 15 years. <strong>PD<br></strong><br>\u2022 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/oct/11/fatos-beciraj-montenegro-stun-denmark-world-cup-roundup\">Round-up: Montenegro stun Denmark while Lewandowski nabs late winner</a></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/video/2016/oct/12/norwegian-football-pundits-distraught-after-shock-san-marino-goal-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/575b2\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2798930\"            data-video-name=\"Norwegian football pundits distraught after shock San Marino goal \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"VGTV Sport\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-57fdf8c9e4b03b22b4fb27bc\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/10/12/161012sanmarino_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/10/12/161012sanmarino_V3.webm\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/10/12/161012sanmarino.m3u8\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/video/2016/oct/12/norwegian-football-pundits-distraught-after-shock-san-marino-goal-video\">Norwegian football pundits are left distraught after San Marino\u2019s shock goal</a></figcaption> </figure>   <h2>5) China come unstuck again</h2> <p>The English do not have a monopoly on self-loathing when it comes to the plight of their football team. Just look at the Chinese and their furious reaction to last week\u2019s defeat to Syria. There was anger on the streets and calls for the president of China\u2019s FA, Cai Zhenhua, to step down, and the mood was hardly improved by events in Tashkent on Tuesday. With their hopes of qualifying for the World Cup hanging by a thread, China desperately needed a win away to Uzbekistan. Instead they lost 2-0, leaving them floundering in Group B. President Xi Jingping\u2019s football revolution appears to have hit a few snags. <strong>JS<br></strong><br>\u2022 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/oct/12/socceroos-posed-headaches-by-cautious-japan\">Socceroos posed a different set of headaches by a more cautious Japan</a></p> <h2>6) Republic just about good enough</h2> <p>Despite <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/oct/09/moldova-republic-of-ireland-world-cup-qualifier-match-report\">Ireland\u2019s win over Moldova</a> on Sunday, James McClean had something to get off his chest. Fresh from scoring the two goals that sealed the 3-1 victory, McClean seemed irked that Martin O\u2019Neill\u2019s team had received plenty of criticism for their performance in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/oct/06/republic-of-ireland-georgia-world-cup-2018-qualifier-match-report\">squeaking past Georgia</a> a few nights earlier. \u201cWe got a lot of flak after the Serbia game and a lot of flak after the Georgia game, I think unfairly so,\u201d said McClean. \u201cI think the Irish press needs to have a bit of a reality check: we\u2019re not going to blow teams away, we know that. We\u2019ve always been a team that works hard. When has winning never been enough?\u201d Quite so. The problem being that if they play like they did against Georgia much more often \u2013 and in parts of that game they barely offered the minimum expected \u2013 those wins might disappear fairly rapidly. Still, the performance against the Moldovans was much better, if not enormously impressive \u2013 a solid cheese-and-ham sandwich after the burnt toast of Georgia \u2013 and perhaps that\u2019s what can be expected of this Ireland team. Genuine, convincing performances in international football are rare, so seven points from their opening three games is good enough. <strong>NM</strong></p> <p><br>\u2022 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/oct/09/moldova-republic-of-ireland-world-cup-qualifier-match-report\">McClean\u2019s double drives Republic of Ireland past Moldova in qualifier</a><br>\u2022 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/oct/09/gareth-farrelly-everton\">Gareth Farrelly: \u2018I still think all the time that I am part of the 10% that live\u2019</a><br>\u2022 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/oct/10/dundalk-stephen-kenny-ireland-europa-league\">Dundalk\u2019s Kenny winning friends and trophies with Irish trailblazers</a></p> <h2>7) Belotti has a chance to establish himself as Italy\u2019s new hope</h2> <p>Andrea Belotti played things down after he scored for Italy against Macedonia, becoming the first Torino player to find the net for the national side in 35 years. \u201cI didn\u2019t know that,\u201d Belotti said after the game.<em> \u201c</em>I\u2019d say it\u2019s not bad for my first time as a starter \u2026 am I a starter now? You must be joking, I know that no-one should ever feel comfortable, partly because the competition is strong everywhere. I was the last to arrive, and I\u2019ve just started.\u201d False modesty perhaps, but there is an opening for a centre-forward in the Italy team. Graziano Pell\u00e8 is now playing in China (and is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/oct/07/graziano-pelle-italy-sent-home-shake-hands-coach\">in Giampiero Ventura\u2019s naughty book</a> after neglecting to shake hands with him in the previous game) so will inevitably lose some edge, Ciro Immobile bagged two of his own in that game but has had a tricky couple of years since starring for Torino, \u00c9der and Simone Zaza haven\u2019t been prolific, and Manolo Gabbiadini has only reached double figures twice in his career. These are all obviously different players, offering different things, but given the 22-year-old Belotti\u2019s start to the season (five goals in four Serie A starts), he has a chance to establish himself.

Well, clearly it\u2019s not the obvious answer, otherwise we wouldn\u2019t be asking the question. The totals, if you\u2019re interested, are 133-108 in \u2018favour\u2019 of the Brazilian. Neymar got the 133<sup>rd</sup> booking against Bolivia last week, meaning he was suspended for the game against Venezuela on Tuesday. The most recent yellow was for dissent, and the way the Barcelona forward gets booted in the air most games it\u2019s perhaps a surprise that it doesn\u2019t happen more often. Indeed, Neymar left that game with blood streaming from his head, the result of what we\u2019ll call a \u2018stray\u2019 elbow from Bolivian forward Yasmani Duk. Rather than apologise, Duk said after the game: \u201cTo become the best player in the world, he\u2019s got to stop this \u2018Charlie Big Bollocks\u2019 behaviour and start showing some respect for his opponents.\u201d This was after a few tricks too many, in the view of the self-appointed enforcer. It\u2019s easy to say Neymar needs to have more self-control, but when he gets that sort of treatment, it\u2019s probably better to cut him some slack. <strong>NM<br></strong><br>\u2022 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/oct/10/conmebol-world-cup-halfway-chile-argentina-brazil\">Tim Hill: Conmebol enters gruelling second half, Chile need to start winning</a><br>\u2022 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/sep/06/south-american-world-cup-qualifiers-lionel-messi-neymar\">Do South American World Cup qualifiers put the Champions League to shame?</a></p> <h2>9) Algeria in trouble already<br></h2> <p>\u201cFrankly, I was expecting more from Algeria,\u201d said Cameroon\u2019s manager, Hugo Broos, after Sunday\u2019s 1-1 draw between the countries in Blida. Several Algerian players were expecting more from their manager, Milovan Rajevac, who has reportedly failed to impress many of the country\u2019s senior players since his arrival. Apparently the manager decided he was in a no-win situation and last night he resigned after just two matches in charge, the first of which was a 6-0 win (albeit over Lesotho). Rajevac was certainly outwitted by Broos on Sunday, as Cameroon enjoyed a cohesion that the home team lacked. That was exemplified by the slick move that led to <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgoy1KG0BXA\">the visitors\u2019 goal</a>. The scorer, Benjamin Moukandjo, found space to create all throughout the game, in stark contrast to Algeria, who struggled to involve their creative players and failed to shore up a defence that has been problematic for a while. Algeria\u2019s new manager, whoever he may be, is going to have to sort that out quickly if a talented squad is to finish top of a perilous group in which the early pace is being set by Nigeria, impressive winners in Zambia thanks to goals by Alex Iwobi and Kelechi Iheanacho. <strong>PD</strong></p> <p><br>\u2022 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/oct/04/rigobert-song-out-of-coma-stroke\">Former Cameroon defender Rigobert Song out of coma after suffering stroke</a></p> <h2>10) Sweden continue to flourish under Andersson</h2> <p>Was Zlatan Ibrahimovic the problem all along? Just kidding. It remains a treasonable offence to speak ill of the Manchester United striker in Sweden, of course, but the post-Zlatan era has got off to a flyer for the Swedes, who are sitting pretty alongside France at the top of Group A after a 3-0 victory over Bulgaria. Although they have lost a player of outstanding individual quality, the early signs are of a more rounded team. Janne Andersson has certainly made a strong impression since replacing Erik Hamren, who oversaw a disappointing campaign at the Euros. Bearing in mind how poor Bulgaria were, Sweden will not get carried away yet. They stuttered a little against Luxembourg and will need to improve against France and the Dutch. But they are moving in the right direction under Andersson. <strong>JS<br></strong><br>\u2022 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/oct/10/christian-benteke-fastest-world-cup-qualifying-goal-belgium\">Belgium\u2019s Benteke scores fastest goal in competitive internationals</a></p>",

It will lead to an increase in debt levels eliminating the chances of a dividend increase and buyback in the medium term.

That\u2019s all this country does, talk about blackfellas.\u201d</p> <p>Concerns about the disruption of elections cycles were also expressed by the NT children\u2019s commissioner, Colleen Gwynne, who said the statutory western child protection model doesn\u2019t fit within Aboriginal communities, and is akin to squeezing a square peg in a round hole.</p> <p>\u201cThere has to be a different way of structuring responses to the issues that are predominantly associated with Indigenous people,\u201d she said.</p> <p>While she supported more decentralised protection services, like community-led placement systems, she feared any success would be derailed by government commitments which didn\u2019t exceed election cycles.</p> <p>Gwynne said the Northern Territory had the country\u2019s highest rate of Aboriginal children taken into protection, but a much lower rate of placing Aboriginal children with Aboriginal families compared to the national rate.</p> <p>She said a significant number of children in care \u201cself-placed\u201d elsewhere after leaving an official placement, sometimes without any change being made to their protection order.</p> <p>One 15-year-old girl had \u201cself-placed\u201d since she was 11, a fact not reflected in her official case file.</p> <p>Gwynne said there was a shortage of therapeutic services to assist families in the early intervention stage, and this impacted on juveniles ending up in detention.</p> <p>Two of the biggest triggers for young people who end up in the justice system were poor parenting and little education, she said.</p> <p>\u201cMy belief is if we can place much more emphasis on the first \u2026 then we will be in a much better position not having our systems being absolutely inundated with young people who by the time they reach these tertiary type systems are seriously affected by their traumatic experiences that they\u2019ve already endured\u201d.</p> <p>Gwynne gave support to the NT government\u2019s shifting of juvenile justice out of corrections and into the newly created Territory families department.</p> <p>\u201cPeople see [youth and adult incarceration] as the same because it\u2019s an element of custody or detention or deprivation of liberty, but it\u2019s actually very different and it needs to be dealt with differently,\u201d she said.</p> <p>\u201cYou do run the risk of blurring the lines if you\u2019re sitting within a corrections department. Even to the extent that you may use the adult facility as an adjunct to the youth facility.\u201d</p> <p>She said juvenile detention centres were \u201clacking any real quality assurance or quality control over critical decisions,\u201d and while her recommendations were generally endorsed, there were issues with the implementation and it was often an exercise in \u201cbox ticking\u201d.</p> <p>She said there had to be better independent oversight of the decisions made in juvenile centres, particularly around critical incidents and use of force.</p> <p>Gwynne said she has had an open and transparent relationship with both the current corrections commissioner, Mark Payne, and his predecessor, Ken Middlebrook, and had never had a problem with accessing any areas of the juvenile detention centres.</p> <p>Gwynne\u2019s predecessor, Dr Howard Bath, told the commission on Wednesday morning that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/oct/12/aboriginal-survival-rests-on-success-of-royal-commission-indigenous-advocate\">a change of government in 2012 saw greatly reduced interest in acting on recommendations</a> he had co-authored in a report on child protection issues.</p> <p>It followed evidence given on Tuesday by the former NT ombudsman, Carolyn Richards, that she was stripped of her power to investigate the child protection system by the then Labor minister, Kon Vatskalis.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/oct/11/child-abuse-reports-written-off-as-unsubstantiated-with-no-investigation-nt-royal-commission-hears\">Her investigation uncovered widespread use of \u201cdummy forms\u201d</a> to cover up hundreds of child protection notifications which weren\u2019t investigated.</p>",

  "<p>If you\u2019re a video game fan of a certain age, you may remember Edge magazine\u2019s controversial review of the bloody sci-fi shooting game, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/may/13/doom-video-gaming-ramones\">Doom</a>. Perhaps you enjoyed a good laugh, as many first-person shooter fans have, at the writer\u2019s much-mocked assertion: \u201cif only you could talk to these creatures, then perhaps you could try and make friends with them, form alliances \u2026 Now that would be interesting.\u201d</p> <p>Of course, we all know what happened. There would be no room in the Doom series, nor any subsequent first-person blast-\u2019em-up, for such socio-psychological niceties. Instead, we enjoyed 20 years of shooting, bludgeoning and stabbing, the ludicrous idea of diplomacy cast roughly aside. </p> <p>But during this era, something else was happening in game design, and in academic thinking around video games and artificial intelligence. Buoyed by advances in AI research and aided by increasingly powerful computer processors, developers were beginning to think about the possibilities of non-player characters (NPCs) who could think and act in a more complex and human way \u2013 who could provide the emotional feedback that the Edge reviewer was thinking about.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkTgX1mGmDg\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/SkTgX1mGmDg?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>Arguably, this quest began in 1985 when Activision released a strange game entitled Little Computer People. Co-created by veteran designer David Crane, players had to care for the randomly generated inhabitant of a suburban home. The character had a limited range of emotions and behaviours, and player interaction ranged from feeding the character, to offering gifts and entering simple commands. This \u2018virtual pet\u2019 concept would later find more complex treatment in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/gamesblog/2006/oct/13/tamagotchilove\">Tamagotchi</a> phenomenon and in the artificial life sim, Creatures. </p> <p>But the most notable continuation was Will Wright\u2019s virtual soap opera <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/gamesblog/2008/apr/16/simsbiggestsellingpcgamei\">The Sims</a>. Released in 2000 it provided a household of intelligent characters who would form relationships and develop behaviours that \u2013 enhanced by the imagination of players \u2013 suggested emotional depth and authenticity. Doubted by many within EA at the time, The Sims was a smash hit, and the continuing franchise has now sold over 175m copies. It was clear that players were interested in the idea of characters \u2013 or more accurately AI agents \u2013 who offered something more than digital bodies to be annihilated. </p> <p>Some of the most interesting advances, however, have come from the independent sector, often fuelled by university research into AI concepts such as neural networks, machine learning and natural language processing. The 2005 game <a href=\"http://www.interactivestory.net/\">Facade</a> by Michael Mateas and Andrew Stern, for example, is an interactive domestic drama featuring a couple named Grace and Trip who are in the midst of an argument that may end their relationship. Taking on the role of a mutual friend, the player is able to talk to the couple using text inputs, making suggestions that the AI characters are able to process and understand via a range of interconnected AI technologies. These include a language processing system, which recognises the words the player uses and interprets the context, a behaviour engine that Mateas and Stern called A Behaviour Language (ABL) that controls the actions and movements of the characters, and a drama manager, which creates interesting beats and moments of tension in the emerging narrative. </p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s amazing, the scarcity of satisfying interactive experiences that are actually about people\u2019s lives \u2013 subject matter that is, of course, the heart of the best literature, cinema, theatre and television,\u201d said Stern at the time. \u201cWe gave Grace and Trip a wealth of problems and hidden motivations leading to the present moment, carefully balanced between them.\u201d </p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmuLV9eMTkg\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/GmuLV9eMTkg?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>The resulting scenes don\u2019t always work \u2013 they can be stilted and strange, the AI system struggling to understand the nuances of human relationships \u2013 but there are moments of emotional intensity in each playthrough, the computer-controlled couple struggling to keep their relationship alive. It was a fascinating experiment.</p> <p>Seven years after Facade, a group of developers at the University of California, Santa Cruz, released a game named <a href=\"https://promweek.soe.ucsc.edu/\">Prom Week</a>, a social simulation following a group of students as they prepared for their school dance. Game designer Aaron Reed was co-creator and lead writer on the project. \u201cEach character in the game is a unique AI agent driven by several thousand rules encoding the social norms and behaviours you might see in a cheesy high school comedy film,\u201d he explains. \u201cCharacters would consider these rules, along with a large database of shared knowledge, such as their histories together, likes and dislikes, personality traits and recent moods, to decide what to do and how to respond to actions from other characters.\u201d</p> <p>The system adds drama by providing each agent with a set of characteristics following high school movie conventions (goths, jocks, princesses) and a range of emotional states. They also view each of their peers based on varying levels of three different aspects: friendship, romance and how cool the other person is. The player\u2019s role involves clicking on any two characters then choosing a style of interaction between them. You then sit back and watch the social physics play out as friendships blossom and crumble amid competing interpersonal ambitions. AI characters may hate a character they\u2019re also romantically interested in, or try to form friendships with others who don\u2019t view them as cool. It\u2019s the whole school experience in one interactive experiment.</p> <p>Like Facade, Prom Week features a built-in drama manager, a sort of intelligent AI system that reads and shapes the second-by-second social data. When a character takes an action \u2013 like breaking up with another student, for example \u2013 the game has a large library of scene templates that can be inserted into the moment to narrate the change in the social state. In this example, the system would search for a break up scene template, modify the dialogue for the particular characters and circumstance and then put it on screen to provide a reason and background for the relationship collapse. \u201cThis effectively gives the underlying social AI system a \u2018narrator\u2019 who can find the right scene to let the characters explain what\u2019s happening to them,\u201d says Reed. \u201cThe system was highly effective at creating characters that felt very specific and interesting while still being driven by an emergent, dynamic social AI system.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"537af541b80ce146ea3056a66ff2b6b803cac122\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/537af541b80ce146ea3056a66ff2b6b803cac122/0_142_758_455/500.jpg\" alt=\"Prom Week: a familiar tale of high school romance, bullying and friendship\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Prom Week: a familiar tale of high school romance, bullying and friendship.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: UCSC</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Importantly, the mix of dynamic social AI systems and scene templates led to an array of convincing procedural behaviours that usually made sense. \u201cOne of the most delightful parts of development for me was seeing the system start to perform the characters correctly, even without having any dialogue written for a specific student,\u201d says Reed. \u201cAs the game came together, we would start to see emergent story moments that no one had specifically written, but were inevitable consequences of the social rules and cast of characters we\u2019d created. It was a bit like watching trained actors start venturing into improv, and coming up with wonderful scenes on their own that were true to their character and appropriate to the play.\u201d</p> <p>Two years later, in 2013, AI coder Richard Evans and narrative designer Emily Short worked together to develop <a href=\"https://versu.com/\">Versu</a>, an AI engine that could create interactive text-based stories based around intelligent and emotional characters. They began to demo the platform with a series of text-based adventures that resembled interactive Jane Austen or Agatha Christie novels, filled with intrigue and disparate characters. Here, instead of coding a small number of set personality traits for each AI agent, everyone had their own beliefs, abilities and parameters which, in theory, lead to an infinite range of habits and quirky behaviours. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4082e661866d3c6fb6fe31ab7dc029cb673ec8d6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4082e661866d3c6fb6fe31ab7dc029cb673ec8d6/15_0_771_462/500.png\" alt=\"Versu presents players with a selection of living stories that work like live choose your own adventure novels\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Versu presents players with a selection of living stories that work like live choose your own adventure novels</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Versu</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cEach character also has a set of interpersonal attitudes,\u201d says Evans. \u201cThese are fine-grained role-evaluations: an evaluation of how well a character is performing a role. So, for example, Mrs Quinn may think that Brown lacks good breeding because he slurped his soup. Or Brown may think that Mrs Quinn lacks a sense of humour because she failed to laugh at his joke. These interpersonal attitudes can be transformed during the course of the game, and can be communicated from what one character to another, via a form of gossip.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cCharacters also have an emotional state \u2013 based on <a href=\"http://www.beinghuman.org/article/do-we-all-have-same-basic-emotions\">Paul Ekman\u2019s typology of emotions</a>. So, for example, Mrs Quinn may be annoyed because Brown was flirting with Lucy. Each character keeps track of her emotional state, the person who the emotion is directed towards, and the explanation of the emotional state or the experience that prompted the emotion.\u201d<br></p> <p>The problem though, was in communicating to players just how complex these behaviours were. When Evans and Short released the first game based on their platform, the iOS adventure Blood and Laurels, players thought it was just a standard scripted choose-your-own-adventure text game \u2013 they didn\u2019t realise that the emerging rivalries between characters were happening through AI. Evans admits that even he was blindsided by his system at times.</p> <p>\u201cThere was one time I was playing a murder mystery game we had designed \u2013 and there was this doctor who came to diagnose how a character was murdered,\u201d he says. \u201cHowever, the doctor was being very rude to my character and kept making dismissive remarks. Initially I thought it was a bug because I knew the doctor\u2019s personality was mostly pleasant, and I knew I hadn\u2019t been rude to him. I thought, oh man, why is he being such an arsehole to me? </p> <p>\u201cI looked through the code and it turned out that much much earlier in the game I\u2019d been rude to a servant during dinner, and the servant had gone into the kitchen and told the people there what a jerk I\u2019d been \u2013 one of those people was the doctor. He remembered that. This took me quite a long time to debug. This is an example of how emergence is exciting but it opens up questions about game design.\u201d </p> <p>It\u2019s an interesting problem. In 2011 a group of researchers at Universidad Rey Juan Carlos in Spain <a href=\": https://www.datsi.fi.upm.es/~jmpena/docs/2011CIG.pdf\">created a program</a> named the Emotional Elicitation Process, that could define and produce emotional reactions in video game characters. The team used the role-playing fantasy game Neverwinter Nights to exhibit the project, imbuing NPCs with a range of emotions. \u201cParty members could fall in love and might disregard their own safety to save someone they liked, for instance,\u201d recalls AI researcher Michael Cook. \u201cIt\u2019s tricky to design for, though, because on the face of it it looks like stupid behaviour. Like a lot of new AI ideas, communicating it to the player is really crucial.\u201d</p> <h2>Do game characters need emotions?</h2> <p>Games such as Prom Week, Facade and The Sims were built around AI systems that created their own stories on the fly, featuring human interactions that resembled simple soap operas. But while these games proved a perfect testbed for creative and emotional AI agents, the commercial industry has had no immediate use for these fascinating innovations. In most games, AI is about controlling and directing non-player characters to provide a certain level of challenge to the player. In a shooter or strategy game, you want characters who can avoid danger areas and work to flank the player, and the major challenge is writing an effective AI pathfinding system \u2013 a means for the character to navigate the game\u2019s environment. In short, there\u2019s no need for emotion or creativity when all you\u2019re required to do is provide a target for the player while not bumping into the furniture. <br></p> <p>\u201cI think the rise of emotionally intelligent game characters has been hampered by two major factors,\u201d says Reed. \u201cOne is the difficulty of developing and using the technology, and the other is the lack of a proven track record to inspire game producers to tackle that challenge. It\u2019s a bit of a chicken-and-egg problem: unlike other aspects of AI such as pathfinding, there aren\u2019t established algorithms and architectures for [emotional] character AI, which means a lot of difficult original research and experimentation on a pretty big scale: precisely the sort of thing that\u2019s out of reach for most indies or academics, but tends to get cut in big-budget titles as a risky, unknown factor.\u201d</p> <p>But while the mainstream games industry was overlooking emotional character design and emergent behaviours, the concept of computational creativity was becoming a major element of artificial intelligence research. From the 1980s, the idea that AI systems could learn to think like humans and devise their own narrative, artistic or linguistic works began to intrigue both universities and major technology companies. This has led to developments like IBM\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.research.ibm.com/cognitive-computing/computational-creativity.shtml#fbid=wumHhfu4mHN\">intelligent computer cook</a> that invents its own recipes, and the <a href=\"http://www.whim-project.eu/whatifmachine/#/welcome\">What If Machine</a> created by a group of European universities, which answers hypothetical \u2018what if\u2019 questions submitted by users. It also led to ANGELINA, a computer program developed by Michael Cook that can write its own simple video games, sourcing graphics and concepts by browsing internet search engines.</p> <p>A lot of these theories and methodologies are now feeding contemporary academic research into games and emotional AI agents. Mark Riedl is associate professor at Georgia Tech and director of the university\u2019s Entertainment Intelligence Lab. He\u2019s currently working on a project named Quixote, an AI system designed to make it easier for non-specialist programmers to create intelligent \u2018virtual agents\u2019. Quixote <a href=\"https://research.cc.gatech.edu/eilab/publications/learning-from-stories\">allows AI agents to learn social rules</a> and behaviours through reading stories sourced online; right now Riedl uses Amazon\u2019s online crowdsourcing marketplace <a href=\"https://www.mturk.com/mturk/welcome\">Mechanical Turk</a> to commission people to write short stories around set themes. To demonstrate the concept, Riedl developed a game called Robbery World in which an AI agent has to rob a bank: it studies a series of bank robbery stories submitted on Mechanical Turk; learns the common elements (travel to bank, go to counter, pull out gun, demand cash) and is then rewarded for carrying out any action that advances the plot.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re looking at how to create complicated virtual characters for games and social simulations,\u201d says Reidl. \u201cThe idea is that humans can tell (or crowd-source) stories about how to behave and the AI will train the characters from those stories. I think it would be especially useful in populating role-playing games with virtual characters \u2013 it\u2019s a very different use of AI and a different way of thinking about how to use storytelling. We are currently integrating Quixote with Minecraft.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c9dc589d63f15f41f35cb1154a363ba8f430bb0c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c9dc589d63f15f41f35cb1154a363ba8f430bb0c/0_77_762_457/500.jpg\" alt=\"In the Restaurant Game the AI waitress had learned how to behave by watching hundreds of humans play through the game in her role\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">In the Restaurant Game the AI waitress had learned how to behave by watching hundreds of humans play through the game in her role</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: MIT</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Riedl, then, envisions a new era of AI game characters that can research and learn from human stories or actions in a game world and thereby work out how to act like humans; imagine a Witcher character who observes how you play, almost like listening to your stories round the campfire as you save your game, and then remembers the morals of those stories the next time they appear by your side in battle. This process of teaching behaviours to machine learning algorithms is going to be of huge importance in the coming years and its implications stretch far beyond games. AI research is obviously also being applied to robotics \u2013 ineed Riedl and fellow researchers at Georgia Tech are looking at how Quixote could be used to teach robots how to <a href=\"http://www.news.gatech.edu/2016/02/12/using-stories-teach-human-values-artificial-agents\">behave in a socially and morally acceptable manner</a>. </p> <p>The Entertainment Intelligence Lab isn\u2019t the only place working towards this idea of AI agents learning from people. Ten years ago, Jeff Orkin\u2019s fascinating <a href=\"http://alumni.media.mit.edu/~jorkin//restaurant/research/\">Restaurant Game</a> got players to take on the role of a customer going out for a meal, with the waitress controlled by an AI. However in preparation for this simulation, he asked thousands of volunteers to play the game as the waitress, while the AI watched and learned from their actions. The resulting agent was able to cope with a vast range of player actions and behaviours.</p> <p>This is where things lead in an interesting new direction. In 2013, Orkin co-founded <a href=\"http://www.giantotter.com/\">GiantOtter Technologies</a>, a tech company that\u2019s now taking the idea of human-trained agents and designing advanced conversational AI to power a new generation of human-like chatbots. This is a sector that companies like Facebook, IBM, Google, Apple and Amazon are very interested in, envisioning the use of AI bots in customer relations, tech support and staff training. Reidl is working in this arena too, designing what he calls \u201cinteractive improvisational storytelling chatbots\u201d. </p> <p>Intelligent chatbots are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/sep/18/chatbots-talk-town-interact-humans-technology-silicon-valley\">a big deal in technology right now</a> \u2013 we all watched with horror and amusement when Microsoft released its own bot named Tay onto Twitter earlier this year, only for it to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/mar/24/tay-microsofts-ai-chatbot-gets-a-crash-course-in-racism-from-twitter\">quickly learn racist, sexist behaviours</a>. Both Riedl and Orkin see connections between the idea of chatbot that can converse freely and imaginatively with users and an AI game character who can do the same. Indeed, the fascinating 2014 game The Suspect used IBM\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.ibm.com/watson/\">Watson</a> technology, designed to help coders create convincing humanlike chatbots, to create a police interrogation thriller in which the eponymous suspect is played by the chatbot technology.</p> <p>But while we can understand why big companies like Amazon might want human-like chatbots to provide customer services, the reasoning isn\u2019t so clear for games. Scripted narrative titles such as Mass Effect and Witcher 3 already provide characters and stories that we relate to and feel for. Is it necessary to add the complexity of AI systems that \u201cthink\u201d for themselves and potentially make idiosyncratic decisions based on data not immediately obvious to the player? What will that add?</p> <p>You perhaps have to think about where games are going. Over the last five years we\u2019ve seen a huge design shift away from linear narrative adventures and toward open-world games with procedurally generated landscapes and the capacity for emergent stories. In many ways what\u2019s missing from the highly naturalistic worlds of Grand Theft Auto and Witcher is characters that have their own agendas and internal lives \u2013 that can provide on-the-fly challenges for the player, or just register your existence in the game world. In the action adventure title Middle Earth: Shadow of Mordor, critics and players reacted very positively to the game\u2019s Nemesis system, which allowed computer-controlled enemies to remember fights they\u2019d had with the player and bring these up in later encounters. </p> <p>It wasn\u2019t a particularly sophisticated AI system, but it added a sense of permanence and agency to the game \u2013 it made you feel part of a functioning social world. In a similar way, Ubisoft\u2019s sci-fi action game Watch Dogs let users hack into the phones of passers-by and learn about their lives \u2013 a practice that would often kickstart little emergent missions, and drew civilians into the story. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a8f8a7df2438e255eec7e1d9c6a2bd664df4d4ea\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a8f8a7df2438e255eec7e1d9c6a2bd664df4d4ea/78_0_2370_1422/1000.png\" alt=\"James Ryan\u2019s Bad News project is a game that uses human actors whose characterisations are governed by an AI program\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bad News \u2013 by James Ryan, Ben Samuel, and Adam Summerville \u2013 is a game that uses human actors whose characterisations are governed by an AI program</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: James Ryan</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>What mainstream game developers may need is a third-party AI engine that produces interesting characters for them, without all the expensive research and development. Those solutions are emerging. James Ryan is a PhD student at UC Santa Cruz, working in the <a href=\"https://games.soe.ucsc.edu/eis\">Expressive Intelligence Studio</a>. He and his collaborators are working on Talk of the Town, an AI platform that creates interactive experiences featuring intelligent characters who have ongoing personalities encompassing emotions, beliefs, memories and relationships. \u201cThere are two core AI problems that Talk of the Town is tackling,\u201d says Ryan. \u201cHow do you support autonomous characters who have ongoing subjective experience of the game world, and how do you support unconstrained conversational interaction between player and NPCs? We have systems that decide how people go about their daily routines, and how the various subjective phenomena should be triggered over the course of a character\u2019s day \u2013 things like forming, propagating, misremembering knowledge or memories, and forming or evolving relationships.\u201d</p> <p>Ryan and his collaborators are using three AI elements to power their platform: a dialogue manager to handle conversational flow between characters; a natural language generation (NLG) system that takes the dialogue manager\u2019s decision about how the NPC should respond (structured as a \u201ccontent request\u201d) and generates a line of dialogue that performs accordingly; and a natural language understanding (NLU) system being developed in collaboration with Adam Summerville \u2013 the most complex element. \u201cIt takes in free-text input and converts the player\u2019s utterance to a form that tells the dialogue manager how the world should be changed and how the NPC should respond,\u201d says Ryan. \u201cHere, we\u2019re using neural networks \u2013 specifically, the LSTM architecture that\u2019s all the rage right now.\u201d</p> <p>To illustrate the platform Ryan and his collaborators are writing a series of their own small games. In Juke Joint, a collaboration with Tyler Brothers, the player controls a juke box in a bar crowded with AI characters \u2013 the songs you play have a direct affect on the emotions and conversations of the characters allowing you to direct the scene. National Pastime has the player entering a series of towns, interacting with locals and looking to scout baseball players. His experiments are populated by fallible, forgetful characters who exchange information skews through the Chinese Whisper effect of human gossip. It would be a remarkable system in a role-playing game where local myths, rumours and prejudices could cloud a player character\u2019s mission.</p> <p>\u201c[Ryan is] modelling the inner monologues of these AI characters, their thoughts, their emotional states, what they remember, what they\u2019ve forgotten,\u201d says Michael Cook. \u201cThese are all the complicated human qualities that people value in each other, and that we rarely associate with AI. In James\u2019 other game, Bad News, the same AI characters have their memories modelled, so they can see things, forget they saw them, misremember them and overhear someone telling someone else what they remember \u2013 or misremember. James seems very interested in these human qualities and giving AI the power to understand them. He\u2019s one of the coolest games researchers out there at the moment.\u201d </p> <p>Does Ryan see an era in which an AI platform like his could be integrated into a mainstream game? \u201cAbsolutely!\u201d he says. \u201cThat\u2019s the dream, there are several of us working very hard to make it come true \u2013 Richard Evans and Emily Short included. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"720ba5673f136c023c7ef06dfe5893a08fc62fac\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/720ba5673f136c023c7ef06dfe5893a08fc62fac/0_0_1799_1080/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Could a future version of Grand Theft Auto feature a city populated by intelligent characters with their own biographies and emotions?\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Could a future version of Grand Theft Auto feature a city populated by intelligent characters with their own biographies and emotions?</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rockstar</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cA major hold-up has been memory issues. GTA can\u2019t even keep a car in memory after it\u2019s left the player\u2019s field of view, so there\u2019s been no room at all for maintaining something resembling a character\u2019s inner world. This is all changing of course, and I think that expanded memory resources could be the boon that makes the next generation of emotional AI not just possible (which it already is), but practical.\u201d</p> <p>Another name to look out for in this sector is Mobius AI. Founded in 2015 by a team of video game veterans and AI researchers, including Aaron Reed, the company is developing an AI platform specifically for the mainstream games industry. \u201cWe\u2019re working on a project to provide game developers with a social AI engine that can power game characters with greater knowledge about the world and the ability to react and perform in dynamic situations, which has never been available before in a complete package like this,\u201d says Reed. \u201cIn the same way game technologies like SpeedTree or PhysX let devs plug in an engine for vegetation or physics, we want to provide an engine for social AI that lets game makers focus on creating interesting characters rather than worry about the tech that drives them.\u201d </p> <p> \u201cThe details of what we\u2019re working on are still under wraps, but one bit of wisdom we\u2019re bringing from our previous projects is that social AI is a different animal from many computer science problems that can be solved by just a better algorithm. Much like the way the brain seems to work, the best solutions seem to involve many small little systems working together to give rise to intelligent-seeming emergent behavior.\u201d</p> <p>Imagine a version of Grand Theft Auto, then, in which the missions don\u2019t just come from a central authored narrative \u2013 they also emerge from the ambitions and conversations of the civilians who usually just dumbly wander the world. What if two ambitious characters with low morality scores meet in a cafe and concoct a plan for a bank robbery. What if they realise they need a good driver, and recruit the player? But imagine their plans were overheard by another AI who decides to foil the plan? These complex systems of ambition and interaction could create totally new forms of game structure.</p> <p>Some action games may even move away from violence altogether. With natural dialogue systems we\u2019re heading into an era where players could negotiate with computer-controlled characters, where persuasion, seduction and intrigue replace guns and aggression. The recent science fiction adventure Event(o) features the player character interacting with a spaceship\u2019s onboard computer in order to convince the machine to plot a course back to Earth. The computer has a range of emotional states and the player has to figure out how to read these and respond to them correctly.</p> <p>At the moment, the premise of conversing with an intelligent computer makes sense because the conversation can be presented to the player through a text interface without it ruining the immersion of the game. The challenge for mainstream titles is to create AI characters that can actually voice their thoughts and feelings, rather than simply display them as text. But that technology is coming: DeepMind recently announced WaveNet, a tool that generates highly convincing human speech. If this were built into a game with natural language capabilities, then simple yet totally emergent conversational interactions could be verbalised by an agent. We\u2019re maybe not far from AI characters who can literally speak their minds \u2013 even though those \u201cminds\u201d may never be that sophisticated.</p> <h2>The age of character adventures</h2> <p>Whatever the technicalities, Reed feels that with more complex emotional AI systems we\u2019ll start to see new types of games \u2013 romantic comedies, character studies, coming-of-age stories \u2013 augmenting rather than replacing the sorts of experiences we now enjoy.</p> <p>\u201cAs we start giving more control to social simulations, we can at first expect to see richer, more intriguing versions of the types of characters we have now,\u201d says Reed. \u201cShopkeepers who can carry on a more dynamic conversation, quest-givers or lore-spouters who can answer questions or respond to your specific circumstances, and so on.<br></p> <p>\u201cBut as your system gets smarter and you\u2019re willing to give it more control, it really starts suggesting entirely new genres of game that don\u2019t yet exist. Part of the reason you don\u2019t see many character-focused games right now is that games aren\u2019t yet really *about* character interaction: they\u2019re about moving through environments, defeating enemies, jumping over gaps, and so on. Once we\u2019ve got the tech to make characters playable, those stories become possible to tell in interactive form: but through a profoundly different lens. </p> <p>If only you could talk to these creatures, then perhaps you could try and make friends with them, form alliances... Now that <em>would</em> be interesting. Perhaps not in the context of Doom (there will always be games that are just about shooting and having fun \u2013 and that\u2019s <em>fine</em>), but in totally new gaming paradigms. Surely it will be more meaningful, more emotionally resonant if your seduction of Yennifer in Witcher 3 or Garrus in Mass Effect came, not through a scripted tree of pre-packaged conversations, but through a dynamic relationship? One thing\u2019s for sure, we would certainly find out more about those other characters.</p> <p>As Reed puts it: \u201cIn much the same way that playing with a simulation of fire or fluid dynamics can lead you to deeper understanding or quicker insights than simply reading about them, truly interactive characters potentially let us have a more immediate and intuitive kind of relationship with them than with characters in linear stories. And that is really exciting.\u201d</p>",

That wasn\u2019t what Brexit was supposed to be about at all, fret the free market zealots. What counts is the non-xenophobic leave campaign they ran inside their heads, not the one that erected <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/may/21/vote-leave-prejudice-turkey-eu-security-threat\" title=\"\">posters in the street</a> warning that the Turks were coming.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jun/27/britain-eu-vote-leave-ukip\">Farage\u2019s \u2018breaking point\u2019 posters were indefensible \u2013 but I\u2019m glad we voted leave  | Douglas Carswell</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The remain side has its own obtuse streaks, the least attractive of which is the habit of treating leave voters as victims of stunted enlightenment \u2013 dismissing their choice as economic self-harm driven by stupidity or racial spite. This isn\u2019t a failure to apprehend the existence of autonomous minds in others, but it comes close, by denigrating the critical capability of those minds to assess a situation and respond rationally. It is hardly empathic.</p> <p>Reluctance to credit opponents with an operative conscience is now endemic in political argument. On the left, there is hair-trigger readiness to see every proposal to manage migration as a Nuremberg law in the making. On the right, it has become normal to treat warnings about the economic consequences of Brexit as rhetorical sabotage, as if there is no difference between the observation of a threat and the treasonous wish that it be realised.</p> <p>The writer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/dec/16/christopher-hitchens-obituary\" title=\"\">Christopher Hitchens</a> once identified this as the argumentative strategy of tinpot ideologues, whereby \u201cif an opponent thought he had identified your lowest possible motive, he was quite certain that he had isolated the only real one\u201d.

It is a rejection of the idea that politics is a shareable space at all, because there is no reason to respect the argument of an opponent whose motive is beneath contempt. Malice requires no rebuttal.</p> <p>In such a climate, the ability of politicians to see things from alternative points of view, which should be a debating strength, risks becoming a handicap. The candidate who finds traces of validity in a rival proposition risks moral contamination in the eyes of core supporters. Moderation and caveat sound murky. The crowd-pleasing method is to project total certainty, from which flows emotional clarity (but no workable solutions).</p> <p>No one is immune to bias and prejudice. People change their minds quite rarely. But every adult \u2013 and, it transpires, even the bonobo monkey \u2013 is capable of theorising the existence of a mind different to their own. To study or shut out that view is a choice we can make.

  "<p>Former Labor treasurer Wayne Swan has accused one of Australia\u2019s biggest companies of evading taxes for more than a decade, and for lying to the former Labor government during the height of the mining tax debate.</p> <p>Swan used parliamentary privilege on Wednesday to claim BHP Billiton had been \u201cgaming the system\u201d for years by using aggressive transfer pricing to smuggle profits out of Australia.</p> <p>He said recent damning evidence from Senate inquiries and the Australian Tax Office showed BHP had ramped up its Singapore marketing hub between 2005 and 2014 to avoid paying taxes on profits of $5.7bn.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/16/bhp-billiton-reports-record-full-year-loss-of-us639bn\">BHP Billiton reports record full year loss of US$6.39bn</a> </p> </aside>  <p>He said at the height of the mining tax debate in 2010, BHP had also inflated the impact of the minerals resource rent tax on its operations while funnelling its profits through foreign tax havens.</p> <p>He said the public had only learned in April last year that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2015/apr/10/bhp-billiton-refuses-to-reveal-tax-bill-estimate-to-senate-committee\">the ATO had been auditing BHP\u2019s tax arrangements at the time</a>. He said BHP had failed to mention those audits when the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/jul/16/australia-mining-tax\">mining tax debate </a>was in full swing.</p> <p>\u201cSome of us in this place remember 2010 and the mining tax debate,\u201d he said. \u201cI remember it pretty well.</p> <p>\u201cTwo things really stand out in my mind. One was BHP and Rio Tinto frothing with outrage at the very suggestion they were paying too little tax during a period when Australia\u2019s mineral resources (owned by the Australian public, not by them) were enjoying record high prices. </p> <p>\u201cThe other was the claim that the government\u2019s proposed resource rent tax would destroy their operations, close projects and kill jobs.</p> <p>\u201cOne of the central arguments BHP used at the time was that they paid very high rates of corporate tax, and this somehow excused paying a historically low share of tax on the supernormal resource rents they were earning.</p> <p>\u201cWell, now we know the truth. Between 2005 and 2014, BHP sold Australian minerals to its Singapore marketing hub to avoid paying taxes on profits of $5.7bn. While BHP paid $1bn in top-up taxes, these taxes only applied to 58% of the profit generated through the Singapore marketing hub. </p> <p>\u201cA full 42% of the profit was untaxed in Australia. Nor was it taxed by the government in the UK, where BHP is co-owned. The directors of BHP Australia and BHP UK are the same people.\u201d</p> <p>Swan said the tax paid by BHP represented only 10% to 12% of its total profits, made almost exclusively by selling Australian resources. </p> <p>He said the miner\u2019s Singapore operation was \u201cclearly an artifice\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cWhile BHP maintains that its Singapore operations are at arm\u2019s-length from its Australian branch, I make the simple point again that the directors of both the UK and the Australian entities that control the Singapore hub are the same people,\u201d he said. </p> <p>\u201cThis situation is clearly an artifice.</p> <p>\u201cAt the height of the mining tax debate BHP were inflating the impact of the minerals resource rent tax on their operations while funnelling their profits through foreign tax havens.<br></p> <p>\u201cAs the government negotiated with miners in good faith on critical tax issues, the miners were expanding their tax avoidance regimes.\u201d</p> <p>Swan made his accusations in the House of Representatives while a parliamentary delegation from Singapore was looking on.</p> <p>He then attacked the Business Council of Australia, saying its failure to speak out about aggressive transfer pricing had compromised its \u201cstanding and credibility\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cTax avoidance is a huge part of the trashing of public faith in democratic legitimacy around the world,\u201d he said.<br></p> <p>\u201cEveryday workers have the sense the economy is an inside/outside game, in which the wealthy play by different rules and everyone else is denied opportunity. </p> <p>\u201cThey\u2019re not wrong. And at least in part, this is what is driving the popularity of modern political demagogues from Donald Trump to Marine Le Pen. </p> <p>\u201cAnd the activities of companies like BHP in Australia who are constantly making pious calls for bipartisanship and quality reform, are leading to further polarisation and less faith in our democratic institutions.\u201d</p> <p>A spokesman for BHP Billiton sent this response to Guardian Australia.</p> <p>\u201cOur Australian adjusted effective tax rate, inclusive of corporate tax, petroleum resource rent tax, and royalties, in financial year 2016 was approximately 57%. Our global rate was slightly higher at 59%. This demonstrates that we pay our \u2018fair share\u2019 of tax both in Australia and globally.\u201d</p> <p>BHP did not say anything about the years before 2016.</p> <p>Swan said there was a conventional distinction, in typical tax discussions, between legal tax avoidance and illegal tax evasion, but in reality there was a spectrum.</p> <p>\u201c[BHP\u2019s] behaviour leads me to believe that they have operated at the evasion end of the spectrum for over a decade,\u201d he said.</p>",

The community cannot allow the corporate veil to hide the moral responsibility of those that run them. When companies fail to pay their fair share of tax, revenue must be found elsewhere from businesses and individual taxpayers. </p> <p>The billions of dollars avoided are forever lost to education and infrastructure, which are investments vital to growth and ultimately support the bottom line for business....</p> <p>At a time when this government hacks and slashes at the social safety net in the name of budget repair, it is simply obscene for corporates to walk away with money on this scale.</p> <p>There is a stark contrast between the respect boards and executives expect and what their actual behaviour merits.

That was the estimate. The actual amount of payments in the 2016 PEFO was $425bn. This is a government that has ensured we have controlled expenditure. The budget I handed down in May, based on the final outcome figures, will see expenditure as a share of the economy fall.</p> </blockquote> <p>This from <strong>Greg Jericho</strong>:</p> <p>The Treasurer argues that the 2013 Pre-election fiscal outlook predicted \u201cthe level of nominal expenditure on payments by the Government for 2015-16 to be $424.4bn and that the \u201cactual amount of payments\u201d for that year was $425bn.</p> <p>This, he argues, means \u201cthis is a government that has ensured we have controlled spending, controlled expenditure.\u201d</p> <p>It all sounds good until you realize he is playing around with nominal figures.

Here are a few highlights:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I genuinely believe that politics is a noble calling, not a grubby, necessary evil. We are so incredibly fortunate to live in free and fair democracies where we have the right to run for parliament. Jo was an exceptional person, there\u2019s no doubt about it. But she wasn\u2019t unique, and she would have been the first person to say so. There are so many women in our communities who could serve with distinction: we need to help them to get into parliament and to be proud to be political.</p> <p>Of course, this isn\u2019t just about numbers, and it\u2019s not about \u2018having a go\u2019. It\u2019s about results. <strong>Women need power to change things.</strong> You can\u2019t change things if you are a name on a ballot, a quota filled \u2013 you need your seat in parliament. Participation is the start, but power is the end. Jo knew that \u2013 it\u2019s why she worked so hard across party lines to make sure that women were running for seats they could win and it\u2019s why she herself joined a party where she stood a shot of becoming an MP and, one day, a minister, even a prime minister.</p> <p>Jo had courage, but she was also unashamed to have ambition.

Cathy McGowan thinks so</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The Indi independent, <strong>Cathy McGowan</strong>, gave a speech last night calling for a minister for young people and a campaign from the Australian Electoral Commission to engage young people in civic participation. </p> <p>There is a backstory.</p> <p>McGowan won her first election in 2013 against the Liberal frontbencher <strong>Sophie Mirabella</strong> by 439 votes. After the election, there were complaints referred by the Liberal party and an investigation by the Australian relating to allegations of electoral fraud by a number of young voters who were involved with the McGowan campaign. One was McGowan\u2019s niece.<br></p> <p>The original <a href=\"http://www.theaustralian.com.au/national-affairs/batch-of-false-votes-tars-cathy-mcgowans-indi-win/news-story/5d4128b4a1f80e109062dd8fdd3f634c\">story ran in September 2014</a> and there were allegations raised during the joint standing committee on electoral matters (Jscem). The Australian Electoral Commission investigated and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2015/sep/25/voter-investigation-not-about-political-gain-say-indi-campaigners\">then the Australian federal police</a>.</p> <p>The AFP then charged <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2015/dec/18/niece-of-federal-mp-cathy-mcgowan-faces-court-over-alleged-election\">Maggie Ellen McGowan, 27, and Sophie Petrea Fuchsen, 24</a>, with providing false and misleading information, alleging the pair voted in the seat of Indi while living in Melbourne during the 2013 election.</p> <p>The case dragged on and eventually was thrown out in April this year, almost two years after it began. From the story:<br></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Outside court the women\u2019s lawyer, <strong>Rob Stary</strong>, said the case was bound to fail and a terrible waste of resources.</p> <p>Both women were students at the time and the AEC website clearly said students did not need to change their \u201chome address\u201d, he had told the court.</p> <p>\u201cThe original complaint, whoever it was that initiated it, was quite scurrilous,\u201d Stary told reporters.</p> </blockquote> <p>The heart of the issue is around country kids who go to cities to study. As they often have no fixed address, they remain enrolled for voting and other purposes at their family home. But within this loophole, someone found cause to complain. On the numbers, given these are conservative electorates in regional Australia, it seems incredible that the complaint may have originated within the Coalition. If these young people cannot enrol at their home address, it is likely they would remain without a vote. </p> <p>Anyway back to McGowan. She wants the appointment of a minister for young people, to \u201caddress systemic barriers that prevent young people from civic participation, to advocate on their behalf, and help ensure that when policies affecting young people are considered, they do not have an adverse impact\u201d.</p> <p>This is what she said last night.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>There is confusion about enrolment rules. The involvement of the Australian federal police, Australian Electoral Commission and media in the affairs of 27 young people in my electorate caused the loss of trust in our democratic political institutions. In 2016 approximately 350,000 eligible young people were not enrolled to vote. In the eyes of many young people, these events are even more reason why they feel it makes no sense to engage. No wrongdoing was found after rigorous investigation but these young people are still being scrutinised. We need to stand up for our young people, we need to support them and we need to encourage them to participate in politics. The AEC needs to be supported to engage young people.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-10-12T02:23:58.236Z\">at 3.23am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57fd8fe5e4b01d9dd2c9016b\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-12T01:34:06.969Z\">2.34am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>A summary, before the time gets away.</p> <ul> <li><strong>The Singaporean prime minister has addressed the parliament praising the relationship between Australia and Singapore.

We heard a number of speeches last night. Longtime Liberal National party advocate <strong>Warren Entsch</strong> made a heartfelt contribution \u2013 in the end arguing for the plebiscite as the \u201cthe best possible chance\u201d in a decade. You can argue the point on the plebiscite but you cannot argue with Entsch\u2019s intentions. His frustration with both parties is palpable.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It has been a long road to get to this point, and I accept that there are those who are not happy with where we have ended up. The plebiscite certainly is not my preferred position either. I put up a cross-party bill back in 2015 in good faith, but it joined the other 17 unsuccessful bills that have gone before it ... This is a battle that has been going on for decades now. And, while I am not challenging the intention of some individuals across politics in championing this cause or those within the marriage equality movement, I am concerned that people are losing sight of the endgame. For them, it is more about the battle than the outcome.</p> </blockquote> <p>But the opposition leader, <strong>Bill Shorten</strong>, also spoke:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>This plebiscite is not about marriage equality. It is about two things and two things only: <strong>Tony Abbott\u2019s</strong> ideology and <strong>Malcolm Turnbull\u2019s</strong> job security. Equality for minorities should not be conditional on the approval of majorities. You do not have an opinion poll on rights. That is why they are called rights. Imposing this plebiscite would not just be a waste of money or a failure of leadership; I think it would be a failure of basic decency. It is a glaring contradiction of our national ideal of a fair go for all. </p> </blockquote> <p>We will have more of those speeches throughout the day.</p> <p>On top of that, <strong>the revised legislation for the backpackers tax </strong>will also come to the house, with the attached increases in the passenger movement charge and the backpacker superannuation changes. <strong>Barnaby Joyce</strong> has already been out this morning.</p> <p>The <strong>Singaporean prime minister, Lee Hsien Loong</strong>, will address the house mid-morning. </p> <p>There is a big cybersecurity report out. <strong>Cameron Stewart</strong> of the Oz <a href=\"http://www.theaustralian.com.au/national-affairs/defence/threat-of-cyber-terror-closes-in-says-report/news-story/c471a1cb730fee42bf53641929667e36\">reports</a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Terrorists could be able to break into secure Australian government networks to wreak significant disruption or destruction within three years, according to a major government report on cyber security. </p> </blockquote> <p>I will flesh that out in a minute.</p> <p>Let\u2019s get this baby up and running.

  "<p>Yet another book about consciousness? These days it seems no self-respecting neuroscientist should be without at least one book-length stab at explaining how the brain enables that most central, if elusive, feature of what makes us human. This is Susan Greenfield\u2019s second. Yet, as she reminds us, it has only been in the last few decades that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2015/jan/21/-sp-why-cant-worlds-greatest-minds-solve-mystery-consciousness\">consciousness studies</a>, once regarded as the province of philosophers, and off-limits for neuroscience, has become a cottage industry for brain researchers, oblivious to the sceptics who joke that the initiator of this new wave was an anaesthesiologist, Stuart Hameroff, whose day job ought surely to be elucidating the processes through which people become unconscious.</p> <p>This origin may help explain why many brain researchers have such a narrow definition of consciousness, understood by Greenfield, in common with her many peers, as what we retain while awake and lose while asleep or anaesthetised. Such a restricted description raises many questions about this protean term. Can there be consciousness in the abstract, distinct from being conscious of <em>something</em>? Awareness is only one of the several meanings the OED ascribes to consciousness, including self-knowledge and, to me the most important, \u201cthe totality of the impressions, thoughts, and feelings, which make up a person\u2019s conscious being\u201d.</p> <p>Neuroscientists are rarely trained in philosophy, but a little modesty might not go amiss. Some committed reductionists among them maintain that consciousness is merely a \u201cuser illusion\u201d \u2013 that you may think you are making conscious decisions but in \u201creality\u201d all the hard work is being done by the interactions of nerve cells within the brain. Most, however, are haunted by what their philosophical sympathisers call the \u201chard problem\u201d of the relationship between objective measures \u2013 say of light of a particular wavelength \u2013 and qualia, the subjective experience of seeing red.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/the-lay-scientist/2014/oct/03/mind-change-susan-greenfield-has-a-big-idea-but-what-is-it\">Mind Change: Susan Greenfield has a big idea, but what is it?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Within their restricted definition there are two potentially productive questions that neuroscientists can ask about consciousness: first, how and when it emerged along the evolutionary path that led to humans? And second, what and where in the brain are the structures and processes that enable conscious experience? The evolutionary question has been discussed extensively by the neurologist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/feb/12/self-comes-mind-damasio-review\">Antonio Damasio</a>, who has mapped the transitions between reflex responses to external stimuli in primitive animals through awareness to fully developed self-consciousness, on to the emergence of increasingly complex, large brains.</p> <p>Greenfield is concerned with the second question, the identification of the neural correlates of consciousness. The most innovative research and theory making in this area has come from the DNA Nobelist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2004/jul/30/obituaries.science\">Francis Crick </a>and his long time collaborator Christoph Koch. Arguing that consciousness could be reduced to awareness, they studied the processes in the brain enabling specific visual experiences, locating them in key brain regions and even classes of nerve cells within these regions. Greenfield disagrees; what is needed, she argues, is to study consciousness as it is experienced day-to-day, not in the controlled world of the laboratory.</p> <p>Hence the title of her new book, in which she follows what might be occurring in the brain of a man \u2013 \u201cyou\u201d, in Greenfield\u2019s formulation \u2013 from the moment he wakes, through taking the dog for a walk, going to work in a boring office, fantasising about \u201cwine, women and song\u201d and coming home to a depressed, non-employed wife, a mother-in-law with dementia, and a stroppy 14-year-old son, until he finally sleeps and dreams. This you/he offers nothing for LGBTQ people or straight women to relate to. Greenfield, a scientist who has railed against the sexism of her colleagues, here constructs a \u201cyou\u201d that echoes a blokey 1950s past. Faced with this \u201cyou\u201d, it is scarcely surprising that his wife is depressed.</p> <p>This \u201cday in the life\u201d becomes the launch pad for a description of the brain processes underlying her protagonist\u2019s experiences. Greenfield\u2019s earlier career as a pharmacologist shapes her approach, and she offers a fluent and accessible account of current research in these fields, from the effects of environments on the brain to the latest findings of sleep research. Coming home provides the cue for a discussion of the pharmacology of depression and Alzheimer\u2019s disease and the immaturity of the adolescent brain, along with her often stated but little evidenced convictions that the era of smartphones and social media is rewiring the brain, and of the dangers of recreational drugs. Walking the dog offers a rather superficial wander into the debates about animal consciousness.</p> <p>These accounts are intended to provide neurological support for her big idea \u2013 it would be an exaggeration to call it a theory \u2013 of consciousness. Consciousness, she tells us, is not embedded in single nerve cells (did anyone ever think it was?), nor in the whole brain, but in transient and fluctuating groups of cells (she calls them assemblies) firing in concert.</p> <p>This is scarcely a novel idea, and it is not helped by the somewhat flat-footed analogies she draws on to illustrate her argument. The assemblies act like dimmer switches; activation by some particular external stimulus generates conscious experience of that stimulus; as the wave of activity passes, so the experience fades from our consciousness. Or, in an image repeated throughout through the book, the stimulus is like a stone thrown into a pool, the ripples from the impact activating the assembly of cells and hence somehow creating consciousness.</p> <p>As empirical support for her idea of assemblies, she turns to experiments made in her own lab on thin slices of tissue cut from rat brains. Novel imaging techniques make it possible to track the activity of nerve cells in the slice. If a point on the slice is briefly stimulated (the stone thrown into the pool), a wave (ripple) of activity spreads out to nearby cells before fading away over the next 10 or so milliseconds. The cells briefly activated in this wave are her assembly. Her dimmer switch has been turned up, though it is unclear whether she thinks the rat brain slice is thereby made conscious.</p> <p>There\u2019s plenty of evidence for the ways in which the activities of nerve cells in the human brain are linked, rhythmically entrained in both space and time, and Greenfield\u2019s rat brain slices don\u2019t add much, either empirically or theoretically. As to what they mean for \u2013 to adopt another of her metaphors \u2013 turning the water of brain activity into the wine of consciousness, perhaps the less said the better.</p> <p>The \u201chard problem\u201d of the philosophers is unresolved.

  "<p>Queensland has three \u201ccredible\u201d options to achieve a 50% renewable energy target by 2030, a panel of experts said.</p> <p>A draft report by the state\u2019s independent <a href=\"http://www.qldrepanel.com.au/draft-report\">renewable energy expert panel</a> said \u201csignificant government policy action\u201d would be needed for Australia\u2019s biggest carbon polluting state to reach the target.</p> <p>But it said the impact on electricity prices would be \u201cbroadly cost neutral\u201d.</p> <p>Earlier this month the federal environment minister, Josh Frydenberg, criticised Queensland and other states for pursuing \u201cridiculously high and unrealistic\u201d renewables targets.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/sep/29/south-australia-blackout-explained-renewables-not-to-blame\">South Australia's blackout explained (and no, renewables aren't to blame)</a> </p> </aside>  <p><a href=\"http://file:///Users/jrobertson/Downloads/Queensland_Renewable_Energy_Expert_Panel_Draft_Report.pdf\">The report</a>, handed down on Wednesday by the panel\u2019s chair, the investment banker Colin Mugglestone, charted three scenarios for Queensland to achieve its target, which would require between 4000MW and 5500MW of new large-scale renewable generation capacity between 2020 and 2030.</p> <p>Until 2020 the state government could use existing federal funding under the national renewable energy target to attract projects to Queensland, the report said.</p> <p>Queensland\u2019s power sector \u2013 its single largest source of carbon emissions \u2013 would cut emissions from 2016 by 31% if stronger national climate policy was enacted, including through carbon pricing. This would see the closure of about 1500MW of coal-fired generation in Queensland but limit state subsidies to renewable producers to $50m.<br></p> <p>\u201cThe stronger national action pathway is not within the direct control of the Queensland government, but represents a credible scenario in the context of national climate change policy,\u201d it said.</p> <p>A national emissions intensity scheme would drive Queensland to reach 41% renewable energy generation, leaving state government action to deliver 1900MW to hit the 50% target.</p> <p>The other scenarios, a steady increase in renewable generation or a ramp-up closer to 2030 to take advantage of cheaper technology, would both cut emissions by 25%. The steady increase would cost significantly more via renewable subsidies at $900m versus $500m under the \u201cramp pathway\u201d but the cumulative cuts would be greater.</p> <p>Under both the steady and ramp scenarios, \u201cno closure of existing fossil-fuel generators [is] expected prior to 2030\u201d but their operating cash flows would take a hit of between $600m and $1.1bn.</p> <p>This would affect mostly the state, which owns two-thirds of generation capacity. </p> <p>The panel recommended the renewables policy action be funded through \u201celectricity market mechanisms\u201d, with the forecast \u201ccost-neutral outcome\u201d being a result of \u201cmodelled suppression\u201d of wholesale power prices offsetting renewables subsidies.</p> <p>But this pricing outcome was \u201cnot guaranteed and could differ, for example, if existing generation capacity is withdrawn from the market, especially coal-fired generation\u201d, the report says.</p> <p>The Queensland energy minister, Mark Bailey, said the release of the report was a \u201cgroundbreaking development\u201d in the government\u2019s pursuit of its renewables goal.</p> <p>It showed \u201cQueensland can meet a 50 per cent renewable energy target while maintaining electricity security and reliability over the next 14 years\u201d.</p> <p>It also showed the \u201chuge benefits\u201d to the state economy through $6.7bn in new investment, especially in regional areas, and a net average increase in jobs, both direct and indirect, of between 6,400 and 6,700 a year, he said.</p> <p>After South Australia\u2019s recent power blackout, Frydenberg <a href=\"http://www.theaustralian.com.au/national-affairs/frydneberg-warning-over-pursuit-of-unrealistically-high-renewable-energy-targets/news-story/497043a21d73e06a64231017aaa3043d\">told Sky News</a> that state governments had an \u201cillusion at the moment about the impact that renewables are having on the system\u201d.</p> <p>He warned of the \u201clack of consistency in quantity of generation\u201d from heavy reliance on renewables.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ve got the states pursuing these ridiculously high and unrealistic state-based renewable energy targets,\u201d Frydenberg said. </p> <p>\u201cIn Queensland, they have a 50% renewable energy target by 2030 when they only have about 4.5% of renewable generation currently \u2026 We really need to get the states and the commonwealth on the same page when it comes to their state-based targets and the federal target which, for us, is 23.5% by 2020.\u201d</p> <p>Tim Seelig, of the Queensland Conservation Council, said the panel\u2019s draft report showed recent commentary about renewables targets being unrealistic was \u201cwrong, and that in fact there are several options for achieving the targets\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cQueensland is the highest emitter of carbon pollution of all the Australian states, and electricity generation is the largest single source of those emissions,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cIt is therefore imperative that renewable electricity generation is made a high priority in Queensland.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Gareth Southgate has had two games in charge for England and, though no one could have seriously expected him to remove all the team\u2019s imperfections in that time, it still cannot be satisfactory that it is so difficult to see even the first flickers of improvement.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2016/oct/11/slovenia-england-world-cup-2018-qualifier-live\">They were poor again here in Ljubljana</a> and fortunate, in the extreme, that Southgate did not have to reflect on England\u2019s first defeat in a qualifying fixture for seven years. For that, they were indebted to Joe Hart in a match when he reminded us that, on form, he still has games when he can legitimately claim to be one of the best in the business. England were alarmingly susceptible in defence. They rarely passed the ball with any authority and there was absolutely no sense of a group of players desperately trying to impress a new manager. Southgate admitted his team had been lucky and it is not easy finding any compelling evidence to advance the case for him getting the job full-time.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/oct/11/wayne-rooney-gareth-southgate-england-failings\">Not even Wayne Rooney\u2019s arrival can inspire Gareth Southgate\u2019s England</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Perhaps that is a harsh conclusion when he has just been parachuted into the role at short notice but, Hart aside, it was difficult to identify a single England player who can reflect on a satisfying evening\u2019s work. The performance was a reminder that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/oct/10/england-football-wayne-rooney-gareth-southgate-dropped-slovenia-world-cup\">removing Wayne Rooney from the starting lineup </a>will not automatically fix this team and, once again, there were a few boos at the final whistle from England\u2019s fans.</p> <p>That will continue to be the soundtrack for as long as England continue to put in these kinds of dishevelled displays. Jesse Lingard and Theo Walcott did little to disprove the theory they were fortunate to be in the team.</p> <p>Daniel Sturridge threatened only sporadically and England\u2019s three shots on target is their lowest in a competitive fixture since playing Costa Rica in the last World Cup. Southgate talked about inheriting \u201ca mess\u201d and the performance left the impression little had changed. His opening line in the post-match press conference summed it up. \u201cWe can play better, for sure,\u201d he said.</p> <p>At least Rooney can still consider himself a favourite of England\u2019s followers. Three days after the Wembley crowd subjected him to minor boos, the first appreciative cry of \u201cRooney\u201d reverberated round Slovenia\u2019s flat-pack stadium within the opening 90 seconds.</p> <p>More notably, there was voluble support for Sam Allardyce, including a loud rendition in the opening few minutes of \u201cJustice for Allardyce\u201d and various other chants making it clear what they thought of the Daily Telegraph investigation that brought him down. If the hardcore fans want Southgate to take charge permanently, this was not an occasion when it became evident. His name was not sung once.</p> <p>Southgate was probably entitled to feel aggrieved about an early attack when Sturridge was knocked over by a Slovenia defender in the penalty area but it would have been misplaced to focus on that moment too much bearing in mind the number of occasions when Hart spared his team.</p> <p>England\u2019s deficiencies first became evident when Eric Dier underhit a backpass in the 10th minute and Hart had to rush from his goalline to block Roman Bezjak\u2019s shot before a second Slovenia attacker, Jasmin Kurtic, curled a follow-up effort against the post.</p> <p>That, however, was far from the only time England found themselves in trouble because of their own carelessness. Gary Cahill, in particular, had a difficult game and could have been sent off for a studs-up challenge on Josep Ilicic late on, leading to a confrontation between Lingard and Aljaz Srtuna. Lingard was defending Marcus Rashford but Southgate was unimpressed and said his player needed to learn some more self-control.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/oct/11/gareth-southgate-england-mess-point-slovenia-joe-hart\">Gareth Southgate admits England were a \u2018mess\u2019 but hails point in Slovenia</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Ilicic created numerous problems for England\u2019s defence but Hart kept him out every time, including one occasion when Jordan Henderson, wearing the captain\u2019s armband with little grace, gave the ball straight to his opponent.</p> <p>Southgate seemed startled by how vulnerable his team were at the back, talking of it being \u201cvery much a work in progress\u201dand noting Slovenia\u2019s \u201copportunities tended to be set pieces or self-inflicted\u201d.</p> <p>Twice at the start of the second half, Slovenia had corners from the right and on both occasions Hart denied them with outstanding goalkeeping. The second save, in particular, from Kurtic\u2019s header was the kind of moment to reignite the debate about why Hart is spending the season on loan at Torino.</p> <p>He should never have been exposed so often and Southgate explained that when he brought on Rooney as a 73rd-minute replacement for Sturridge the decision was based on \u201cthe need for some experience in there to calm things down\u201d.</p> <p>Slovenia were undoubtedly encouraged by their 1-0 win against Slovakia on Saturday but it would still have been reasonable to expect England to play with more control and, though Southgate pointed out it was a difficult playing surface, he did also recognise it was no excuse for the number of times passes were misplaced.</p>",

  "<p>If Moscow, with its punk and skater subcultures, is the next fashion destination, then Gosha Rubchinskiy is its poster boy. The Russian designer is not a household name, but that\u2019s hardly surprising. His clothes are tricky, esoteric even: gently oversized utility jackets, high-waist jeans tied with shoelaces; T-shirts emblazoned with the hammer and sickle. Along with Georgian/Parisian label Vetements, he is the hottest designer in menswear; his collections routinely sell out and today, during the interview, there are actual autograph collectors behind us.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8e4b5d3da41463d24bb3e21e5c6915843b48a86e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8e4b5d3da41463d24bb3e21e5c6915843b48a86e/0_385_4912_6975/704.jpg\" alt=\"Gosha Rubchinskiy: styles himself like a 1990s Muscovite.\" width=\"704\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Gosha Rubchinskiy: styles himself like a 1990s Muscovite.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR company handout</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Rubchinskiy, like his clothes, is a slave to nostalgia and still styles himself like a 1990s Muscovite.

Last autumn, his line of red T-shirts with hammer and sickle logos, which sold out almost instantly, were another example of what he is trying to do: subvert the space between catwalk and streetwear. The people who wear them are young, too young, in fact, to understand what the symbol means, but this doesn\u2019t matter to Rubchinskiy. \u201cIn Ukraine last year we noticed kids buying clothes with the symbol thinking it was a fashion thing \u2013 it\u2019s almost lost its meaning,\u201d he says. \u201cSo using it, it\u2019s not that we believe in it, but that we are referencing what is going on in the world.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c8ea015f164ba3c7d91c448409517075f97baea4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c8ea015f164ba3c7d91c448409517075f97baea4/0_247_4928_2957/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Gosha Rubchinskiy\u2019s collection, SS17\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Gosha Rubchinskiy\u2019s collection, SS17</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gosha Rubchinskiy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>His latest move is a unisex perfume, and, at the <a href=\"http://shop.doverstreetmarket.com/gosha-rubchinskiy\">launch in Dover Street Market</a> in London, his fans are exactly as he describes: teenage boys, \u201cGosha-heads\u201d, who look and dress like the designer.

The three met through Lotta, partied in Paris, and model in each other\u2019s shows: Rubchinskiy opened the Vetements SS16 show in the infamous DHL T-shirt; Lotta styles both designers\u2019 shows; and both have the capacity and power to fly in skater friends from Russia and Georgia to model. As a result their shows stand out as being decidedly unglam and street-focused. Katerina Zolototrubova, fashion editor of Russian Vogue, describes this look as \u201cGopnik\u201d, a problematic term used to describe \u201cthe bad boys from suburbs\u201d in Russia, and aesthetically not dissimilar to what is happening in the UK, with designers such as Caitlin Price and Cottweiller. Rubchinskiy\u2019s pieces sit in the same frame, except with the skater twist (\u201cone of the last subcultures we have\u201d), wistfully referring back to the stuff they were wearing in the 1990s, including Tommy Hilfiger, Adidas and Nike. \u201cEverything was branded with logos.

What could be cleverer than to brand the nostalgia people feel for the Soviet Union, to take a memory of communism and put it into the capitalist sphere? The hammer and sickle has a clear definition but to this new generation, it has lost some of its historical and political context.

  "<p>For two days in early June every year, China comes to a standstill as high school students who are about to graduate take their college entrance exams. Literally the \u201chigher examination\u201d, the <em>gaokao</em> is a national event on a par with a public holiday, but much less fun. Construction work is halted near examination halls, so as not to disturb the students, and traffic is diverted. Ambulances are on call outside<strong> </strong>in case of nervous collapses, and police cars patrol to keep the streets quiet. Radio talkshow hosts discuss the format and questions in painstaking detail, and when the results come out, the top scorers are feted nationally. A high or low mark determines life opportunities and earning potential. That score is the most important number of any Chinese child\u2019s life, the culmination of years of schooling, memorisation and constant stress.</p> <p>On 8 June, the final afternoon of this year\u2019s <em>gaokao</em>, parents of exam takers at one school in Beijing were packed tight around the school gate, jostling to get to the front of the crowd where a white metal barrier held them back. Special security guards handed out water bottles and cheap paper fans, while another manned a first aid stand under a large parasol. Cars were parked all the way around the bend of the road leading to the gate, simmering in the summer heat. \u201cThey\u2019re all here to pick up their kids,\u201d a city police officer patiently explained to a driver struggling to find a space. A red banner above the barrier declared the school a \u201cNational unified <em>gaokao</em> examination point\u201d. At the first sign of movement inside, the parents pushed in closer, craning their necks to spot their children emerging.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2016/nov/04/is-chinas-gaokao-the-worlds-toughest-school-exam-podcast\">Is China\u2019s gaokao the world\u2019s toughest school exam? \u2013 podcast</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Shortly after 5pm, a student named Yuan Qi walked out clutching a clear pencil case and wearing a dazed expression. Around him, hundreds of exam-takers celebrated the end of their ordeal. Some clutched bouquets of flowers given to them by their parents; others posed awkwardly for photographs. Yuan Qi\u2019s father, an administrator in the People\u2019s Liberation Army, was dressed in shorts and a polo neck. He had been at the front of the crowd, holding his phone up high to record the moment. But when his son came out, he greeted him silently and led him away from the hubbub to where his mother was waiting. She took his pencil case to stop him fidgeting with it. \u201cHard?\u201d another parent asked Yuan Qi as they passed. \u201cDepends which subject,\u201d he replied. His father beamed with pride.</p> <p>Yuan Qi is 18, thin and wiry, with blue half-rim spectacles, close-cropped hair and budding wisps on his upper lip. A student at Beijing 101 school, one of the capital\u2019s most prestigious boarding schools, he is the nervous sort \u2013 constantly fiddling with stationery or picking at his fingers. He has a habit of rushing to the end of his sentences, slurring his words when excited, as if frustrated that telepathy is not an option. Ever since he was a young boy, growing up in Hebei, the province surrounding Beijing, Yuan Qi has had a talent for maths, science and problem solving. He loves reading murder mysteries, especially Agatha Christie novels in Chinese translation, which is how he came up with his English name \u2013 Hercule \u2013 although his moustache is yet to live up to it.</p> <p>The first time a teacher of his mentioned the <em>gaokao</em>, Yuan Qi was in primary school. Used as a distant incentive for working hard, the word kept cropping up in school and at the dinner table until it dawned on him just how high the stakes were. While college entrance is competitive in any country, in China the top universities can select as few as one in 50,000 students. Competition is intense for white-collar jobs, with a graduate unemployment rate of about 16%, and which college a student goes to has an immediate impact on career and even marriage prospects. That placement is decided by a single factor: their three-digit <em>gaokao</em> score.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Spy cameras, radios and earpieces that transmit questions and answers have been found hidden in pens and underwear</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>With so much to gain or lose, cheating is a big problem. Spy cameras, radio devices and earpieces that transmit questions and receive answers have been found hidden in jewellery, spectacles, wallets, pens, rulers and underwear. Most examination rooms install CCTV cameras, and some use metal detectors. Last year, police busted a syndicate in Jiangxi province, where professional exam-takers were charging parents up to a million yuan (\u00a3121,300) to pose as students. In Luoyang, a city in Henan province, examiners deployed a drone to hover above school buildings and scan for radio signals sent in or out. Fingerprint and iris-matching has been used to verify the identity of students. Exam papers are escorted to schools by security guards and monitored with GPS trackers, while the examiners who draft them are kept under close scrutiny in order to avoid leaks. This year, new regulations came into effect that could sentence cheats to up to seven years in prison.</p> <p>Yuan Qi was quietly confident. In his mocks he was averaging in the 690s, out of a maximum of 750 \u2013 good enough to get into the capital\u2019s elite universities. He had been cramming for 12 hours a day in the months leading up to the test, with extra classes at weekends. Since March, he had been operating on just six or seven hours sleep a night. Every possible step had been taken to maximise his chances of succeeding. The day before the first morning paper, his parents had rented a hotel room next to Tsinghua University middle school, where he would sit his papers, so that they could arrange his meals and attend to his every other need. By that point, Yuan Qi had spent so much time doing mock exams that he was totally inured to the real thing, which passed in a haze.</p> <p>\u201cIt went about usual,\u201d he told me as we walked back to his hotel, massaging his wrist. \u201cNothing out of the ordinary. Now I just want to go home and play some games.\u201d Yuan Qi\u2019s father was still recording videos of him, still grinning. \u201cThe exam is very nerve-racking, and each time when I was standing outside, before it began, I was terrified. But when you\u2019re actually taking it it\u2019s not so bad.\u201d Now that the struggle was over, there was nothing he could do but wait for the result.</p> <h2>* * * </h2> <p>The <em>gaokao</em> is emblematic of the Chinese education<strong> </strong>system as a whole. In the west, it is often seen as monolithic and rote; in China as tough but fair. In Europe and America, there is the notion that Chinese schools produce automatons incapable of critical thought; in China, many seem to think that western classrooms are full of students standing on desks and ripping up textbooks, \u00e0 la Dead Poets Society. Yet, where the Chinese model used to be roundly criticised for rewarding rote learning, now the system\u2019s gruelling schedule and supposed high standards are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/feb/22/china-education-exams-parents-rebel\">increasingly admired</a> overseas. Thomas Friedman, the New York Times columnist, has praised Shanghai\u2019s school system with at times absurd hyperbole. (One column was fawningly titled \u201cThe Shanghai Secret\u201d.) Last year, the BBC invited two Chinese teachers to take over a sixth-form class in the documentary <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/aug/04/china-schools-testing-britain-copy-government-pupils\">Are Our Kids Tough Enough?</a> (Spoiler: they weren\u2019t, but nor were the teachers.)</p> <p>In China there are no illusions about the system being perfect. The exam is widely criticised for putting impossible pressures on children. Dissatisfaction with the <em>gaokao</em> is one reason that, among wealthier segments of the population, large numbers of students are choosing to study abroad. But, ultimately, most people support it, or at least see no alternative. \u201cChina has too many people,\u201d is a common refrain, used to excuse everything from urban traffic to rural poverty. Given the intense competition for finite higher education resources, the argument goes, there has to be some way to separate the wheat from the chaff, and to give hardworking students from poorer backgrounds a chance to rise to the top.</p> <p>The tradition of a single exam that decides a young person\u2019s prospects is one that goes back to antiquity in China. The imperial examinations or <em>keju</em>, which tested applicants for government office, was introduced in the Han dynasty (206BC to AD220), and became the sole criterion for selection from the 7th century until its abolition in 1905. Aspiring bureaucrats sat a three-day exam locked inside a single cell, in which they also slept and ate. The \u201ceight-legged essay\u201d was the most important paper, an argument in eight sections that elaborated on a theme while quoting from classics such as Confucius and Mencius. All applicants were checked for hidden scrolls; writing quotes on underwear was a popular form of cheating until examiners cottoned on. The pass rate was 1%. Nervous collapses were routine. There is even a ghost-deity associated with exams in China: Zhong Kui, a scholar who killed himself when he was denied first place.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jun/08/chinas-memory-manipulators\">China\u2019s memory manipulators | Ian Johnson</a> </p> </aside>  <p>While not a direct descendant, the <em>gaokao</em> is generally considered a distant relation of the <em>keju</em>. First instituted in 1952 under the new Communist government, the <em>gaokao</em> was suspended during the cultural revolution. Most universities were closed, and remaining college places were assigned according to political background rather than academic ability. It was only in 1977, the year after Mao\u2019s death, that the <em>gaokao</em> resumed in its modern form. The first sitting was open to generations who had been deprived of the chance to pursue higher education \u2013 5.7 million people enrolled, competing for just 220,000 university seats. Since 1978, it has been held every summer.</p> <p>The <em>gaokao</em> is made up of four three-hour papers: Chinese, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/22/china-english-college-test-gaokao\">English</a>, maths and a choice of either sciences (biology, chemistry, physics) or humanities (geography, history, politics). The questions are mostly multiple-choice or fill-in-the-gap, and are notoriously hard \u2013 the maths paper has been compared to university-level maths in the UK. But for many students, the most intimidating element is the essay in the Chinese exam. Students are given an hour to write on one of two prompts, which are often infuriatingly elliptical. Prompts in 2015 included \u201cDo butterfly wings have colours?\u201d and \u201cWho do you admire the most? A biotechnology researcher, a welding engineering technician or a photographer?\u201d. This summer, Yuan Qi\u2019s choice was between \u201cOld accent\u201d and \u201cMysterious bookmark\u201d. (He picked old accent.)</p> <p>It is no surprise that, for many students, the pressure heaped on them by parents, teachers and themselves, is overwhelming. It is possible to retake the exam one year later, but if a student continues to fail there is no safety net or alternative path to university. Suicides are a regular feature of every exam season; a 2014 study claimed that exam stress was a contributing factor in 93% of cases in which school students took their own lives. Last year, a middle school in Hebei province fenced off its upper-floor dormitory balconies with grates, after two students jumped<strong> </strong>to their deaths in the months leading up to the <em>gaokao</em>. And the academic stress starts early \u2013 in July a 10-year-old boy tried to kill himself in oncoming traffic after fighting with his mother about homework. But still the study mill grinds on.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--immersive\" data-media-id=\"77dd05fa1f6ec00d95ef26e0e52a4be81144b98a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/77dd05fa1f6ec00d95ef26e0e52a4be81144b98a/0_159_3896_2338/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Yuan Qi in his bedroom at his parents\u2019 apartment.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Yuan Qi in his bedroom at his parents\u2019 apartment in Beijing.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gilles Sabri\u00e9/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>* * * </h2> <p>In April, two months before the exam, the campus of Yuan Qi\u2019s school was deceptively tranquil. A tree-lined boulevard led up to Beijing 101\u2019s front entrance, where two guards with truncheons watched over the security gate. Inside, the school buildings glistened in the sun, surrounded by spacious sports grounds and a lake with a goose house and lotus flowers. Students walked around in colour-coded slacks that, like all school uniforms in China, more closely resembled pyjamas: dark blue for year 11, mauve and white for year 12, purple for year 13. The school nestles into the west flank of Beijing\u2019s old Summer Palace \u2013 once the relaxation grounds of Qing dynasty emperors \u2013 and a back gate connects directly to the garden ruins. Founded in 1946, Beijing 101 was initially set up to educate the children of China\u2019s top officials, and it still has many such students among its ranks.</p> <p>It was an accomplishment for Yuan Qi to even be there. At his local primary school in Hebei province, there had been 70 to 80 children in each class. The school\u2019s football pitch was never used, as none of the teachers knew the rules. Yuan Qi\u2019s residency papers, or <em>hukou</em>, dictated that he should have stayed in Hebei for middle school, but his father used his connections in the People\u2019s Liberation Army and arranged a transfer to Beijing, with a new <em>hukou</em>. Once there, Yuan Qi enrolled in a better middle school and, thanks to a good performance in the <em>zhongkao</em> \u2013 the entrance exam for high school \u2013 got into Beijing 101 at the age of 16. Yuan Qi was now one step closer to securing his future at the college he dreamed of attending.</p> <p>Just a hundred metres down the road from Beijing 101, in the heart of the city\u2019s university district, lies Peking University (or Beida, as it\u2019s known in China). With its illustrious history<strong>, </strong>roll call of famous alumni and romantic campus dotted with lakes and stone bridges, Beida is the Chinese equivalent of Oxford or Cambridge. Ever since his parents first told him about it as a child, Yuan Qi had always dreamed of going there to study maths. His parents and teachers were encouraging, but even their expectations, he told me, were nothing like the pressure he put on himself.</p> <p>\u201cIn middle school I realised that primary school was easy,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd in high school I realised that middle school was easy.\u201d At Beijing 101, classes had just 20 to 30 students, but the work was twice as intensive as before. As Yuan Qi\u2019s grades were good, he was put into one of four \u201cexperimental classes\u201d in his year, which went at an even faster pace. And on top of his regular subjects, like all Chinese students, he also took two hours of politics class each week. They included the compulsory modules of Mao Zedong thought and Deng Xiaoping economic theory, which were introduced in 1991 as part of a patriotic education campaign. I ordered online one of the politics textbooks that Yuan Qi would be studying from. It was titled Integrity of Thought, and a typical page featured a cartoon of three boys sitting around a table discussing the latest government initiatives (as one does), with an accompanying discussion question for students: \u201cWhat are the everyday applications of these laws?\u201d</p> <p>The routine at Beijing 101 is punishing. At 6.30am Yuan Qi was out of his dorm bed, and he was in the canteen for breakfast by 6.50. At 7.20 came half an hour of self-study reading time. From 8am he had five 40-minute classes, broken by a half an hour of group calisthenics in the yard \u2013 a thousand students doing jumping jacks in unison \u2013 or running around the grounds. Another three afternoon classes were interrupted by five minutes of eye exercises, during which students massaged their tired brows while a recorded track told them to rub behind their ears and press their temples. School broke at 4.05pm, but there was still another three or four hours of homework to be completed before bed.</p> <p>As summer arrived, the pace picked up for Yuan Qi and his classmates. Almost all classes were now spent looking at past <em>gaokao</em> papers in methodical detail. After school, there were two extra hours of mock exams every day, on top of the homework, and five additional classes on Saturday. On Sundays, Yuan Qi\u2019s parents had arranged private tuition for him in English and Chinese. His only relaxation was playing computer games, but whereas in middle school he had enjoyed complex online roleplayers, now he only had time for smartphone apps.</p> <p>When I visited Beijing 101, the scene was not as disciplined as I had expected. School pupils in China are kids, after all, not robots \u2013 they goof around, joke, talk over each other. At the front gate as I waited to be let in, three boys were lifting up a fourth, giving him a wedgie. Inside was a bulletin board listing extra-curricular activities, from drama to traditional crosstalk comedy performances. A corrugated steel fence next to a basketball court was covered in graffiti, albeit sanctioned by the teachers and expletive-free: V for Vendetta; an alien face with the words \u201cOnce I was normal\u201d; \u201cBig Brother is Watching You\u201d, with one of the letters replaced with a swastika. But in class the students quietened down, listened carefully and took notes. In years of reporting in China, I have never heard a single student grumble about their workload. To them, it is simply normal.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"d77a91d5125d4f25d455e67622392dfd4aebba84\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d77a91d5125d4f25d455e67622392dfd4aebba84/0_0_3896_2338/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The campus of Beijing University (Beida), one of China\u2019s top universities.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The campus of Beijing University (Beida), one of China\u2019s top universities.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gilles Sabri\u00e9/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I sat in on one of Yuan Qi\u2019s maths classes while the teacher \u2013 a tough but kindly woman with a strong Beijing accent \u2013 walked through exam-paper equations that left me feeling like a dunce. Yuan Qi followed along at his white plastic desk, where sheets covered in intricate geometrical squiggles were sprawled out next to his pencil case and a roll of toilet paper for blowing his nose. At the back of the classroom, a cartoon of Xi Jinping was drawn in coloured chalk on the blackboard next to the words \u201cWishing you a successful exam\u201d and a reminder: \u201c46 days\u201d. This countdown is a national obsession. If you search for<strong> </strong>\u201c<em>gaokao</em>\u201d<strong> </strong>on Baidu, China\u2019s largest search engine, in the months leading up to the exam, an image appears at the top of the results page, with a clock counting down to the start of the exam, next to a cartoon of a schoolgirl riding a flying book.</p> <p>Before Yuan Qi knew it, the countdown was at 30 days. 15. Ten. Five. With just three days left, on 4 June \u2013 while the rest of Beijing either forgot or ignored the 27th anniversary of the Tiananmen Square massacre \u2013 Beijing 101 held a big pre-exam event in the main lecture hall: part pep talk, part rules refresher. Yuan Qi and his friends joked among themselves, half-listening while the headteacher went through the exam drill in excruciating detail, from how students should register with their IDs to what to do if they needed extra paper. At the end, all the teachers lined up and waved at their pupils from under a PowerPoint slide that read: \u201cWe have already done abundant preparation! Wishing you every success! Awaiting the good news!\u201d</p> <p>With that, 12 years of primary and secondary education were finished. The climax of it all was in sight. Yuan Qi went home, and got his head straight for the first paper.</p> <h2>* * * </h2> <p>In China, the <em>gaokao</em> is sometimes described as a <em>dumuqiao, </em>which translates as \u201csingle-log bridge\u201d \u2013 a difficult path that everyone has to walk. But some have better shoes than others. Rich families lay on extra tutoring for their children in what Jiang Xueqin, a Canadian-Chinese education scholar, described as an \u201carms race\u201d among households looking to increase their child\u2019s chances. Provinces with larger populations have tougher standards of entry into the best universities, while those that are sparsely populated set a lower bar. (This loophole has led to illegal \u201c<em>gaokao</em> migrants\u201d transferring to schools in Inner Mongolia just before the exam.) Students in Beijing and Shanghai get special privileges \u2013 they are the beneficiaries of generous local quotas for the best universities \u2013 despite being more likely to be privileged anyway.<br></p> <p>\u201cScores are highly correlated with socioeconomic status,\u201d Trey Menefee, a lecturer at the Hong Kong Institute of Education, told me. I asked if he considered the exam meritocratic. \u201cI don\u2019t,\u201d he replied, \u201cbut almost every Chinese person does \u2026 Or it\u2019s meritocratic only because it\u2019s equally bad for everyone.\u201d</p> <p>There has been talk of reforming the <em>gaokao</em> for as long as it has existed, but little ever comes of it. The major concession in the early 2000s was to allow separate provinces to draft their own exam papers. This year, top universities trialled interviews with students who show special promise at school. Those who impress may be awarded extra points, which are added to their final exam score. Many students and their families have also called for the English paper \u2013 a stumbling block for many without access to private tuition \u2013 to be made optional.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"e970b6ce2765b0aae8261f3e457f2528e5724304\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e970b6ce2765b0aae8261f3e457f2528e5724304/0_522_1573_944/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Students revise for the gaokao in Jiaxing, China.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Students revise for the <em>gaokao </em>in Jiaxing, China.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: VCG/VCG via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Meanwhile, relatively small changes can meet fierce resistance. In May, the government announced that a quota of 80,000 university places in Jiangsu and Hubei provinces would be reserved for students from poorer regions<strong>,</strong> in an effort to address provincial inequality. But mobs of middle-class parents took to the streets in six cities to protest against the measures, fearful that positive discrimination in favour of poorer families meant their own children would lose out. \u201cThe gaokao isn\u2019t for everyone,\u201d Jiang Xueqin told me. \u201cIt\u2019s for the middle class.\u201d</p> <p>When it comes to more comprehensive reform, the general consensus among education scholars in China is that any alternative would be too easily manipulated by the rich. Were coursework or regular school marks to be taken into account alongside exam grades, bribery would be even more rampant than it already is (parents often give \u201cred packages\u201d stuffed with banknotes to teachers in return for special attention for their child in class, or simply a seat nearer the front). The same goes for direct university admission. And so, futures are still decided by how well each child performs at a cramped desk in a closed room for two days in early June.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/sep/08/chinas-funeral-revolutionaries\">China\u2019s funeral revolutionaries | Jonathan Kaiman</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Not every student in China signs off their fate to the <em>gaokao</em>. Although more than nine million people still take it every year, the number is declining. This is partly down to the rising popularity of vocational courses, which often offer better prospects of finding a job after graduation, especially for those whose grades are less competitive. Above all, more and more students are heading abroad for university, and increasingly for high school. It used to be that the best students went to Beida; now they go to Harvard. There are more than 300,000 Chinese overseas students in US higher education and 90,000 in the UK. While many colleges overseas recognise the <em>gaokao,</em> it isn\u2019t necessary to take it to secure a place. Just as China\u2019s moneyed classes are deciding to protect their wealth by placing it overseas, their children are opting out of the country\u2019s education system on an industrial scale<strong>.</strong></p> <p>One of Yuan Qi\u2019s classmates in the experimental class at Beijing 101, Jiang Xinye, joined the exodus. During her last year of school, by arrangement with her teachers, she stopped coming to class and instead prepared applications to US colleges. Her parents hired the services of Bridge International Education, a company that helps students select colleges and pull application materials together (the bill was roughly \u00a38,000; other companies charge up to \u00a320,000). Instead of the <em>gaokao</em> she took the TOEFL, an English proficiency exam, and her SAT, the US college-entrance aptitude test. She settled on a major in business, and wrote in her personal statement about her experience selling phone cases at school. With the help of a college counsellor she filled in forms for 12 universities. When it was all over she accepted a place at Brandeis, a private university in Massachusetts.</p> <p>Jiang Xinye feels strongly that her chosen path is preferable to that of many of her classmates. Chinese schools just teach the exams, she told me, even more so than abroad. \u201cWe don\u2019t solve problems ourselves,\u201d she said, \u201cthe teacher just tells you the right answer ... and refuses to hear different voices.\u201d One time, over a bowl of bibimbap in a Korean restaurant, the conversation turned to Yuan Qi and his other classmates who remained in the system. \u201cThey don\u2019t realise that their imagination is limited. Even if they want to voice their opinions, they are too timid to challenge the teacher.\u201d This struck me as the opposite of something Yuan Qi once told me: \u201cEverything has a right answer. Even if it\u2019s testing your argument, not the specific contents.\u201d That\u2019s why he disliked the more freeform essay question, while Jiang Xinye disliked everything else. While he sat the <em>gaokao</em> on 7 and 8 June, she was packing for America.</p> <p>Yuan Qi often asked me what school was like in the UK. I swallowed my guilt as I mumbled something about less homework and bad food. One afternoon he used a term,<em> qiutubeilun</em>, which I didn\u2019t understand. I looked it up on my phone: \u201cprisoners\u2019 dilemma\u201d, the famous paradox about mutual competition despite the benefits of cooperation. \u201cIf every [student] agreed to take it more easy, and pursue their own interests and hobbies, then the competition wouldn\u2019t be so intense,\u201d he said. \u201cBut they would rather sacrifice that free time and spend all their time studying to have a greater chance of getting a high mark, and so everyone has to follow.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"a0497e71a152d48f59c263d119c407cbb9dc8947\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a0497e71a152d48f59c263d119c407cbb9dc8947/0_0_5498_3300/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Parents wait for their children to finish taking the gaokao, outside the Beijing Renmin University Affiliated High School, one of the most prestigious in the country.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Parents wait for their children to finish taking the <em>gaokao</em>, outside the Beijing Renmin University Affiliated High School, one of the most prestigious in the country.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kevin Frayer/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>* * * </h2> <p>Yuan Qi sat at a corner window on the second floor of McDonald\u2019s, slurping a McCaf\u00e9 red tea before picking apart the empty cup. It was the morning of 23 June, two weeks after he had sat the exam, and the results would be posted online in a few minutes. The greasy wrapper of a crispy chicken fillet sandwich lay curled on the tray in front of him, next to a book titled Procrastination: Why You Do It and What to Do About It NOW. (In the margins, he had scrawled phrases such as \u201covercome fear\u201d and \u201cknow your weakness\u201d. Next to the sentence \u201cYou tell lies about how you organise your time\u201d, he had written, in English, \u201cME\u201d.) His phone was out on the tabletop and he checked it compulsively every few minutes, waiting for a text from his dad with his score.</p> <p>The previous fortnight had been stressful but not idle. The day after his final exam Yuan Qi was back at the grind again, preparing for an interview at Beida \u2013 part of the new measures that now allow elite universities to meet with promising candidates. It took place a week after the <em>gaokao</em>: there was a written maths test, which was a breeze, and a sit-down with three Beida teachers and five other students, talking about Confucian culture and theoretical maths. The teachers liked him but the outcome was token: they could only give him a maximum of 10 points to be added to his score. After it all, he would still be just a number.</p> <p>The results were released at noon. Most students checked them online, although they could also ring a hotline, or go to their school to check a printout posted on a bulletin board. Later, a full breakdown of their score would be mailed to each student, but for now it was a single mark for each exam and the all-important total, plus their ranking among other students in their province. Yuan Qi was so nervous that he couldn\u2019t bear to be at home. He asked his father to text him, and repaired to McDonald\u2019s instead.</p> <p>Noon came and passed. I tried to distract him with smalltalk, but he was fiddling uncontrollably. Why hadn\u2019t his dad texted yet?</p> <p>At 12:41, his phone buzzed. \u201cWhat is the score that you\u2019re hoping for?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cJust tell me, alright? ......\u201d Yuan Qi fired back. \u201cDon\u2019t keep me on tenterhooks ............!!!\u201d</p> <p>Another three minutes. Buzz. \u201cAre you on the first floor or the second floor?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhy in hell are you asking that for?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIs it a good time to talk?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cJust send the text to me, you\u2019re not allowed to ring!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIs anything wrong?\u201d</p> <p>Yuan Qi was visibly straining not to be rude as he replied. \u201cCan you just send it, OK? Nothing\u2019s wrong, but if you keep not telling me then it will be!!!\u201d</p> <p>A minute passed in agonising silence. Then it came, with no gloss.</p> <p>\u201c664, ranked 1,020 in Beijing.\u201d</p> <p>It was significantly lower than Yuan Qi, or his parents, had expected. Still a high mark, an achievement: 1,020th out of 61,222 examinees in Beijing. But only the top 500 had a real shot at getting into Beida, where the cutoff point was generally taken to be 680. Yuan Qi\u2019s mock results were in the 690s but this mark, in his words, was \u201cordinary\u201d. Not even in the top thousand.</p> <p>His father texted again: \u201cIt\u2019s OK son\u201d. He stressed that they could apply to have his papers re-marked. But Yuan Qi was hyperventilating, taking short shallow breaths and pushing them out through pursed lips, as he stared at his phone. He scrolled down an online list of everyone\u2019s results in Beijing, to double-check his ranking. The Katy Perry song Teenage Dream was blasting over the stereo. His peers were posting their scores in messaging app groups for each of his classes. I didn\u2019t know what to say, and as a journalist I have never felt more intrusive as I watched a young man\u2019s hopes crumble before my eyes.</p> <p>Even with the full breakdown, Yuan Qi never knew exactly why he had underperformed. It was just one of those bad exam days. A few weeks after results day, he was accepted into Beijing Aviation and Space Flight University, known as Beihang for short. It is a good college, specialising in aeronautics, but with an excellent reputation for maths \u2013 not the best of the best, but the best Yuan Qi could have got into. He would go on to start college that September.</p> <p>For now, he was using his summer to do all of the things he didn\u2019t have time for while at school. He went swimming, took classes for the boardgame Go, learned how to ride a bike. And, now that it had served its purpose, his <em>gaokao</em> mark could be forgotten \u2013 no longer relevant, like much of the knowledge he had crammed to achieve it. Yuan Qi still didn\u2019t complain about the exam, even though, by its narrow definition of success, he had failed \u2013 just as the exam had failed to capture his individuality, his passion for learning and discovery.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t feel disappointed so much as lost,\u201d he said, as we left McDonald\u2019s that day. \u201cIf it was just me, if I didn\u2019t have parents, then I would feel a bit better. But why do I feel like it\u2019s they who are the most disappointed? From when I was little, they had such high expectations.\u201d</p> <p>He gathered himself, picked up his book on procrastination, and went home to finish reading it before getting ready for the next chapter.</p> <p>\u2022 Follow the Long Read on Twitter at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/gdnlongread?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\">@gdnlongread</a>, or sign up to the long read weekly email <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2015/jul/20/sign-up-to-the-long-read-email\">here</a>.</p>",
  "<p>Armed with chainsaws, loppers and herbicide spray, 54-year-old Phinda Jaxa and the two young women she directs march into the forests and mountains near George in the Western Cape, South Africa, felling trees, ripping out bushes and shrubs, and pulling plants out of riverbeds.</p> <p>The former beautician is one of thousands of recruits fighting South Africa\u2019s war against invasive alien plant species, non-indigenous plants that harm those native to the region and deplete the water supply.</p> <p>With private companies now investing in the state\u2019s efforts to clear the invasive plants, the question is whether this will be enough to tackle the problem for good. And whether it\u2019s the best approach to start with.</p> <h2><strong>Thirsty plants</strong></h2> <p>Invasive alien plants \u2013 including tree species such as pine, eucalyptus and black wattle, and shrubs such as the triffid weed \u2013 were first introduced to South Africa as early as the 17th century by European settlers.</p> <p>They lower South Africa\u2019s water availability by <a href=\"http://awsassets.wwf.org.za/downloads/wwf009_waterfactsandfutures_report_web__lowres_.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">up to 4%</a> (pdf) in a country where water supply is dwindling rapidly in the face of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/14/south-african-national-park-kill-animals-severe-drought\">the worst drought</a> in at least three decades. Left unchecked, this figure is predicted to rise to 16%. As well as choking out less thirsty indigenous vegetation, invasive species have been known to <a href=\"http://invasives.org.za/plants/famine-weed\" rel=\"nofollow\">reduce crop yields</a> and threaten human health.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2016/jul/13/namibia-drought-coca-cola-meat-construction-industry-water-crisis-climate-change\">'Extreme measures are needed': Namibia's battle with drought comes to its cities</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Jaxa says her life changed when she joined <a href=\"https://www.environment.gov.za/projectsprogrammes/wfw\" rel=\"nofollow\">Working for Water (WfW)</a>, a state initiative launched two decades ago by the former minister of water affairs and forestry to create jobs centred on water conservation. In addition to earning more, Jaxa believes her experience managing a team of people helped her develop the skills she needed to set up her business, a restaurant in the township of Thembalethu. She now juggles the two, taking on field contracts when they are available.</p> <p>Guy Preston, deputy director-general of environmental programmes at South Africa\u2019s Department of Environmental Affairs (DEA), says tens of thousands of jobs have been created through the WfW project \u2013 which now has an annual budget of R1.1bn (\u00a364m) \u2013 and more than 2.8m hectares of invasive species have been cleared. He adds that about 54,000 contractual jobs (which last anything between three months and three years) were created last year alone \u2013 no small feat in an economy saddled with a <a href=\"http://www.worldbank.org/en/country/southafrica/overview\" rel=\"nofollow\">26% unemployment rate</a>. </p> <h2><strong>The private sector</strong></h2> <p>While the involvement of the private sector is seen as fundamental to the continuation of WfW, at present private companies only make up a small fraction of the initiative\u2019s funding. According to Christo Marais, chief director of natural resource management at the DEA, around 80 private companies have invested about R120m (\u00a36.9m) to date. </p> <p>Brewer SABMiller has spent more than R2m to clear invasive vegetation as part of the company\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.sab.co.za/prosper/a-resilient-world/\" rel=\"nofollow\">efforts to conserve water</a>. </p> <p>\u201cClean water is the single most important aspect of beer brewing,\u201d says David Greyling, SABMiller\u2019s sustainable development manager in South Africa. \u201cWe see great opportunity in creating water stewardship projects that not only ensure sustainable high-quality water, but provide employment.\u201d</p> <p>Other big name companies investing in WfW include retailer Woolworths, insurance company Sanlam, and Nedbank, one of the largest banks in South Africa. This private investment is predominantly directed towards specific projects. SABMiller, for example, invests in clearing invasives from the water catchment areas of the Outeniqua Mountains in the Western Cape, where many of the company\u2019s independent hop farmers are located.</p> <p>In addition to jobs clearing plants, new employment opportunities have emerged which use the biomass from cleared invaders to make products such as coffins, walking sticks, educational toys and compost.

While he acknowledges the value of job creation, for example, Mike Muller, former director general at the Department of Water, says that formal project evaluations carried out in the early years of the WfW programme showed that employees on short-term contracts were borrowing money to pay for things such as furniture, which put them in financial difficulties when their contracts ended. Preston, however, says the programme has started promoting financial literacy to help check unwise borrowing by WfW employees.</p> <p>Dean Muruven, WWF South Africa\u2019s water source areas manager, believes WfW plays an important role in managing the country\u2019s water supply and creating employment, but there is no magic bullet.</p> <p>\u201cWfW is one piece in a big water puzzle in South Africa,\u201d says Muruven. \u201c[It] has the potential to help ensure water supplies for millions of South Africans [...] But there needs to be a focus on adding value to create decent, meaningful and sustainable jobs. At the moment many of the jobs the project creates are seasonal and people may not want to do manual work indefinitely.</p> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s more, the current model is heavily state funded. It\u2019s therefore vital to bring more businesses into the project, while continuing to assess and improve it to ensure the whole system works as effectively and sustainably as possible.\u201d</p>",

In an email from August of 2015, campaign spokeswoman Jennifer Palmieri noted Clinton was \u201cnot in the same place\u201d as her team on how to address the controversy.</p> <p>\u201cAs you all know, I had hoped that we could use the \u2018server moment\u2019 as an opportunity for her to be viewed as having take [sic] a big step to deal with the email problem that would best position us for what is ahead,\u201d Palmieri wrote. \u201cIt is clear that she is not in same place (unless John has a convo with her and gets her in a different place).\u201d</p> <p>The Trump campaign pounced on the hacked emails, focusing on one exchange it claimed showed evidence of \u201ccollusion\u201d between Clinton\u2019s campaign and the Department of Justice in the investigation into her private server.

The website took its post down after the error became clear, but Eichenwald questioned how a conspiracy went quickly from Russian print to Trump\u2019s podium.</p> <p>The Guardian has contacted the Trump campaign to ask how the Benghazi email came to the candidate\u2019s attention and whether the campaign would acknowledge what the Republican nominee quoted as Blumenthal\u2019s words were, in fact, from Eichenwald\u2019s 2015 Newsweek article.</p>"
