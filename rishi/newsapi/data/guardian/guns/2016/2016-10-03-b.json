  "<p>A third of seven- to 10-year-old girls believe that they are judged on their appearance and a quarter feel the need to be perfect, according to a study by Girlguiding UK.</p> <p>The charity\u2019s annual girls\u2019 attitudes survey, published on Tuesday, found that girls were suffering from a crisis in body confidence, with 61% of those aged seven to 21 feeling happy with how they look, down from 73% in 2011.</p> <p>The study \u2013 the largest annual research of its kind \u2013 suggests that girls as young as seven feel under pressure to be pretty.</p> <p>More than a third (35%) of seven- to 10 year-old girls agreed that women were rated more on their appearance than their abilities, and 36% said they were made to feel their looks were their most important attribute. <br></p> <p>Campaigners said the findings showed the need to combat the \u201cobjectification and harassment \u2026 ruining girls\u2019 lives\u201d. <br></p> <p>The survey also revealed low levels of body confidence among girls. Almost two-fifths (38%) of the same age group think they are not pretty enough, while a similar number feel they are judged more on their appearance than their ability. Almost a quarter (23%) said they felt they needed to be perfect, while 15% said they felt embarrassed or ashamed by the way they looked.</p> <p>The majority of seven- to 10-year-olds said that what would most improve their lives would be if people would stop judging girls and women on the way they look.</p> <p>The survey questioned 1,627 girls and young women aged between seven and 21 about a range of issues from health and wellbeing to relationships and careers.<br></p> <p>Sam Smethers, chief executive of the Fawcett Society, said women and girls were \u201cpersistently judged on what they look like\u201d and suffered \u201csignificantly higher\u201d rates of depressions and mental illness. \u201cThis is serious. As a society we need to face up to the fact that objectification and harassment is ruining girls\u2019 lives and we are letting it happen,\u201d she said. </p> <p>Dr Carole Easton, chief executive of the Young Women\u2019s Trust, said the survey revealed the presence of \u201cgender inequality\u201d from a young age. \u201cIf we are serious about ensuring that everyone has an equal opportunity to get on in life, then much more must be done to ensure a level playing field \u2013 starting from childhood and into young adulthood, not least by challenging gender stereotypes,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Becky Hewitt, Girlguiding director said: \u201cThis year\u2019s girls\u2019 attitudes survey demonstrates the shocking impact that focusing on girls\u2019 appearance is having on the youngest girls in society.\u201d </p> <p>\u201cGirls have told us to stop judging them on how they look. Every day in guiding, girls inspire us with their bravery, sense of adventure and their kindness. We are calling on everyone to show girls that they are valued for who they are \u2013 not what they look like.\u201d</p> <p>Lyra, 10, a Brownie from south London, said: \u201cI think more girls are judged on their appearance than boys. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair that men get treated differently to women. You have to treat everyone the same.\u201d</p> <p>Liddy Buswell, 18, Girlguiding advocate and Brownie leader, said she was shocked but not surprised by the findings. \u201cI\u2019ve experienced these issues first-hand. I\u2019ve witnessed girls unwilling to speak to groups because of how they look, I\u2019ve heard girls saying they\u2019ve been called names at school and aren\u2019t confident trying new activities as a result.</p> <p>\u201cNo girl should have to worry about the way she looks \u2013 she should be having fun and enjoying herself. This year\u2019s survey is a damning indication that something needs to be done to tackle this growing issue.\u201d</p> <p>Girlguiding UK <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/mar/20/girlguiding-body-confidence-badge-guides\">launched its first \u201cbody confidence\u201d badge</a> in 2014 in response to what it described as a crisis in how girls perceive themselves. It is now launching a new social media campaign to make the public think about how they compliment or praise girls, asking them to praise young women for their achievements or attributes, rather than the way they look, using the hashtag #YouAreAmazing. <br></p> <p>Anne Longfield, the children\u2019s commissioner for England, said: \u201cChildren I speak to tell me they sometimes feel enormous pressure to behave and look a certain way. It\u2019s disturbing that so many young girls think their appearance is the most important thing about them and large numbers feel they have to be perfect. Concerns about body shape can spiral out of control into eating disorders or mental health problems without the right support. </p> <p>\u201cGirls, and increasingly boys, are bombarded with images in the media and the 24/7 availability of social media can put additional pressure on children. It can be really helpful if parents are able to discuss and challenge unhealthy attitudes children may have and don\u2019t ignore warning signs. Schools also have a huge role to play in building resilience to the negative pressures and attitudes girls may face, and lessons that do this need to be a priority in all school timetables.\u201d </p>",
  "<p>A federal appeals court has issued a stinging ruling dismissing as \u201cnightmare speculation\u201d Indiana governor Mike Pence\u2019s attempt to deter <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/03/refugees-drc-congo-us-syria\">Syrian refugees</a> from settling in the state because of terrorism fears.</p> <p>The decision by the seventh circuit on Monday was the latest legal setback to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/mar/01/indiana-syrian-refugees-resettlement-blocked\">efforts launched by Donald Trump\u2019s running mate</a> in the wake of last November\u2019s Paris terrorist attacks to stop Syrian refugees from coming to Indiana by denying them aid.</p> <p>Like many other states, Indiana receives money from the federal Office of Refugee Resettlement and contracts with humanitarian groups to provide local welfare services to refugees. Under federal law, such help must be provided \u201cwithout regard to race, religion, nationality, sex, or political opinion\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/nov/19/connecticut-welcomes-syrian-refugee-family-indiana-governor-says-no\">Connecticut welcomes Syrian refugee family after Indiana governor says no</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The Republican vice-presidential candidate, though, specifically attempted to exclude refugees originating from Syria on the basis that they might be terrorists. He ordered the state not to reimburse groups for the costs of providing aid to Syrians. According to the court, 174 Syrian refugees came to Indiana in the past fiscal year.</p> <p>While this hardline stance may have chimed with the views of Trump, whose immigration policies have included proposing a temporary ban on Muslims entering the US, it was rejected by the three-judge appeals court panel in a six-page ruling that echoed a lower court\u2019s decision earlier this year.</p> <p>\u201cThe governor of Indiana believes, though without evidence, that some of these persons were sent to Syria by ISIS to engage in terrorism and now wish to infiltrate the United States in order to commit terrorist acts here. No evidence of this belief has been presented, however; it is nightmare speculation,\u201d Judge Richard Posner wrote in the <a href=\"http://media.ca7.uscourts.gov/cgi-bin/rssExec.pl?Submit=Display&amp;Path=Y2016/D10-03/C:16-1509:J:Posner:aut:T:fnOp:N:1838881:S:0\">opinion</a>.</p> <p>\u201c[Pence] provides no evidence that Syrian terrorists are posing as refugees or that Syrian refugees have ever committed acts of terrorism in the United States. Indeed, as far as can be determined from public sources, no Syrian refugees have been arrested or prosecuted for terrorist acts or attempts in the United States. And if Syrian refugees do pose a terrorist threat, implementation of the governor\u2019s policy would simply increase the risk of terrorism in whatever states Syrian refugees were shunted to.\u201d</p> <p>The opinion adds that Pence\u2019s claim that he is not discriminating based on nationality but purely acting based on safety concerns is \u201cthe equivalent of his saying (not that he does say) that he wants to forbid black people to settle in Indiana not because they\u2019re black but because he\u2019s afraid of them, and since race is therefore not his motive he isn\u2019t discriminating. But that of course would be racial discrimination, just as his targeting Syrian refugees is discrimination on the basis of nationality.\u201d</p> <p>The outcome was expected after Indiana\u2019s plan was received less than warmly in court during oral arguments last month. Courthouse News reported that Judge Frank Easterbrook <a href=\"http://www.courthousenews.com/2016/09/14/indiana-ban-on-syrian-refugees-draws-mockery-from-7th-circuit.htm\">said</a>: \u201cWhen a state makes an argument that\u2019s saying we\u2019re differentiating according to whether somebody is from Syria, but that has nothing to do with national origin, all it produces is a broad smile.\u201d Posner asked: \u201cAre Syrians the only Muslims that Indiana fears?\u201d</p> <p>Ken Falk, legal director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Indiana, said in a statement: \u201cThe Court of Appeals\u2019 decision underscores what we have said throughout this litigation \u2026 Governor Pence may not constitutionally or legally discriminate against a particular nationality of refugees that are extensively vetted by the federal government.\u201d The ACLU represented Exodus Refugee Immigration, a not-for-profit agency that brought the lawsuit.</p> <p>With immigration and battling Isis key issues in the forthcoming presidential election, leading Republican politicians have accused the federal government of failing to adequately screen refugees and several states have tried to exert more control over who is resettled inside their borders, though immigration is a federal matter.</p> <p>Last Friday, Texas became the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/30/texas-withdraws-federal-refugee-resettlement-program-syrians\">latest state</a> to opt out of the federal refugee resettlement programme, following New Jersey and Kansas earlier this year.</p> <p>But the move will not stop the arrival of refugees from Syria or anywhere else in the Lone Star state. The federal government and aid agencies will instead work to formulate an arrangement that circumvents the state\u2019s administration of the process.</p> <p>The Obama administration has pledged to increase the number of refugees arriving in the US from Syria and other nations.

  "<p>Theresa May long plotted to become leader of her party. Now all those weary evenings on the rubber chicken circuit and long hours in the Home Office have paid off, leaving our new prime minister in ebullient mood in Birmingham. I watched her speak in two private events yesterday night.

And to Tory activists May is recognisably one of them \u2013 unlike her predecessor \u2013 after a 30-year political journey from <a href=\"http://news.radiojackie.com/2016/07/theresa-may-served-on-merton-council.html\">Durnsford ward on south London\u2019s Merton council</a> to Downing Street. Yet there is an extra whiff of triumphalism this year after the referendum result. <a href=\"http://lordashcroftpolls.com/2016/06/how-the-united-kingdom-voted-and-why/\">Almost 5 million Tory voters backed remain</a>, but the mood at conference is one of unrestrained delight: Brussels has been beaten and metropolitan liberals banished, and foreigners flooding Britain will be turned back.</p> <p>May wants her premiership defined by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jul/11/theresa-may-tory-leadership-pitch-andrea-leadsom\">social justice reforms</a>, not just Brexit. This is admirable. But the conference\u2019s post-referendum delirium feels depressing; much of the time like stumbling into a Ukip event. Speeches from the podium talk of taking back control from Europe and imply that other nations will do exactly as Britain tells them, while in fringe meetings they discuss how to stop migration and bring back grammar schools. All that is missing are the purple and yellow ties.</p> <p>Brexit has impacted inevitably on political discourse in both main parties, especially on immigration. A book by Gary Gibbon, the Channel 4 News political editor, suggests the Australian points system was only pushed by leave campaigners to send a <a href=\"http://mogaznews.com/en/World-News/187939.html\">dog-whistle signal to white voters</a> since that nation is seen as overwhelmingly white. Now we must live with the legacy of such cynical and divisive politics.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"25b8152d7ef800d509b53aa01988496c7209f38c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/25b8152d7ef800d509b53aa01988496c7209f38c/4_0_1192_1490/800.jpg\" alt=\"Gary Gibbon, the Channel 4 News political editor\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Gary Gibbon, the Channel 4 News political editor, \u2018suggests the Australian points system was only pushed by leave campaigners to send a dog-whistle signal to white voters\u2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Channel 4</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But like it or not, Brexit is a reality. Those of us who think it a disastrous idea need to stop being so stunned by this self-harming decision and start forging a sensible response to protect the economy and liberal values. Not least since May has interpreted the referendum result as first and foremost a vote to curb immigration, so will sacrifice single-market membership to impose restrictions on free movement.</p> <p>Clearly the prime minister is adopting a negotiating stance ahead of tough talks over terms of departure. But it was noticeable that she <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/02/brexit-theresa-may-prioritises-immigration-curbs-over-free-movement\">singled out food labelling</a> when discussing sovereignty in her Sunday speech, since this ultimately comes under World Trade Organisation deals that will still be binding post Brexit. This underscores spurious claims of \u201ctaking back control\u201d in such an interlocked world. Meanwhile one cabinet minister said that economic corrosion caused by Brexit may slow down flows of migrants moving here for work.</p> <p>But most dismaying is the mixture of naivety, arrogance and rank hypocrisy found behind the Brexit bravura. No one seems to have a clue as to what sort of agreement can be achieved with our closest trading partners in Europe. The Brexit ministry is still scrabbling to find skilled negotiators, but <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/01/theresa-may-to-propose-great-repeal-bill-to-unwind-eu-laws\">article 50 is being triggered within five months</a>. Then Britain will have just two years to sort a trade deal with a bloc of 27 nations that does not want to undermine a union based on free markets and free movement. Yes, they have concerns over migration \u2013 but that is from outside, not within, the EU. At the same time, those new negotiators must do bilateral deals with dozens more nations whose EU agreements will no longer apply to us.</p> <p>Ministers admit they may have to use billions saved from Brussels to bail out firms suffering Brexit fallout, while Downing Street has offered indemnities to alarmed trading partners. Bear in mind <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/15/brexit-canada-trade-deal-eu-model-next-steps\">Canada has taken seven years to sort an EU trade deal</a>, while <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/02/article-50-trade-eu-deals-globalisation\">Switzerland took 17 years</a> to sign one insurance agreement.<a href=\"http://www.euractiv.com/section/uk-europe/opinion/dont-look-to-norway-brexiteers/\"> Norway lost 20,000 jobs</a> and chunks of its fish-processing industry to Denmark and Poland because of having to accept EU tariffs, underlining how duties can distort markets.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ad02b45538725413636f3f5ae61ab60f9eceabd0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ad02b45538725413636f3f5ae61ab60f9eceabd0/0_162_4928_2956/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Delegates at the Conservative conference in Birmingham\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Delegates at the Conservative conference in Birmingham: \u2018all that is missing are the purple and yellow ties\u2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Oli Scarff/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>When pressed about the outcome, a key minister kept repeating to me \u201cthe best possible deal\u201d before finally confessing that Britain would end up accepting the imposition of some tariffs. Another talked airily of deals with Australia, which represents less than 2% of our trade. A third cheerily insisted that City financiers would not wish to move to Frankfurt. A fourth repeated the tired mantra that Europe will give in to British demands because of the size of our economy.</p> <p>We hear brave talk of Britain\u2019s new role in the world, exemplified by <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/10/02/boris-johnson-bbc-is-infuriatingly-anti-brexit-but-remains-singl/\">Boris Johnson\u2019s speech on soft-power strength</a>. But we also learn of fresh limits on foreign students, despite the global success of our universities, and on foreign workers, who fuel growth in so many sectors (and prop up public services). Already the tightening of visas, plus exorbitant costs, is undermining the ability and desire of many in Africa and Asia to trade with Britain. Incidentally the foreign secretary should remember that <a href=\"https://www.rt.com/uk/361393-boris-johnson-africa-country/\">Africa is not one country</a> \u2013 a slip in his speech that spoke volumes about attitudes.</p> <p>Polling indicates that despite the Brexit vote most voters are unwilling to see their own income fall to reduce immigration. But already growth predictions are slowing, and uncertainty is growing. Our nation has set its future aflame with insouciance \u2013 fuelled by provocateurs who pose as saviours of the country, but clearly have few ideas how to control the blaze.</p>",
  "<p>Nine years after its ingredients first began to be combined, the future of one of London\u2019s largest and most contested redevelopment schemes looks as clear as mud soup. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/earls-court-project\">Earls Court Project</a>, guided by architect <a href=\"http://www.myearlscourt.com/the-future\">Sir Terry Farrell\u2019s 2010 masterplan</a>, foresaw the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/davehillblog/2014/dec/15/earls-court-final-curtain-is-sad-reflection-on-boris-johnsons-london\">closure</a> and destruction of the Earls Court exhibition centre, the relocation of London Underground\u2019s Lillie Bridge maintenance depot and the demolition of 760 homes on two council estates. In their place, and also covering the nearby exhibition centre car park, would rise clusters of mostly very expensive flats together with a new high street to help form and connect four \u201cvillages\u201d. Today, some of the masterplan has been partly put into effect but much of it is mired in uncertainty.</p> <p>During the mayoral election campaign, Sadiq Khan disparaged the project for the low number of additional \u201caffordable\u201d homes it proposed. Of the 7,500 that principal developer Capital and Counties (Capco) has permission to build, 760 would be replacements for those knocked down on the two estates and only 740 of the remaining 6,740 would be \u201caffordable\u201d, all of them of the \u201cintermediate\u201d variety aimed at middle income households. That represents a net \u201caffordable\u201d gain of just 11% of the new housing across the entire project area in a major transformation that\u2019s also been opposed on economic, cultural, architectural and environmental grounds. </p> <p>Khan promised to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/davehillblog/2016/mar/10/sadiq-khan-to-review-earls-court-masterplan-if-elected-london-mayor\">review the scheme</a> if he won. The question now is what can and should be done to change it to make it more to the liking of the new mayor and to other critics, most notably <a href=\"https://westkengibbsgreen.wordpress.com/\">campaigners opposed to the demolition of the two estates</a> and Labour-run Hammersmith and Fulham council (H&amp;F). </p> <p>As Khan has pointed out in a written answer to a question from <a href=\"http://www.carolinepidgeon.org/\">Liberal Democrat AM Caroline Pidgeon</a>, he has no <a href=\"http://questions.london.gov.uk/QuestionSearch/searchclient/questions/question_288742\">power to revoke</a> the borough planning consents currently covering the entire development area that were granted by H&amp;F when it was under Tory control and by its Tory neighbour Kensington and Chelsea, all of them waved through by his predecessor Boris Johnson. </p> <p>However, he has also <a href=\"http://questions.london.gov.uk/QuestionSearch/searchclient/questions/question_289325\">underlined to Pidgeon</a> that \u201cshould a new masterplan be submitted\u201d he would assess it \u201cagainst the policies set out in the <a href=\"https://www.london.gov.uk/what-we-do/planning/london-plan/current-london-plan\">London Plan</a>\u201d, the legally-binding planning framework for the whole of Greater London. Khan intends to <a href=\"https://www.london.gov.uk/london-plan-full-review/overview-full-review-london-plan\">change the London Plan</a> and, in the meantime, will soon be publishing <a href=\"https://www.london.gov.uk/what-we-do/planning/implementing-london-plan/supplementary-planning-guidance\">supplementary planning guidance</a> reflecting how he will seek to pursue his goals in the context of a document that currently enshrines Johnson\u2019s. </p> <p>Khan\u2019s election is not the only important new factor in the Earls Court Project story. Market conditions were already changing and have been further affected by Brexit. An oversupply of expensive properties in \u201cprime\u201d central London led to a <a href=\"http://www.cityam.com/235342/earls-court-developer-capital-counties-sees-share-price-fall-over-fears-of-cooling-property-market-\">collapse in Capco\u2019s share price</a> early this year. Rumours of a takeover persist. However, in July, the company\u2019s chief executive <a href=\"http://www.cityam.com/235342/earls-court-developer-capital-counties-sees-share-price-fall-over-fears-of-cooling-property-market-\">told the Telegraph</a> he had suggested to the Greater London Authority (GLA) that it would be possible to increase the grand total of Earls Court Project dwellings from 7,500 to 10,000. </p> <p>Capco says it will be making formal representations to the GLA about Earls Court as Khan\u2019s revision of the London Plan gets underway, adding that \u201cno decision has been reached on whether any [new] planning application will result from this process\u201d. Meanwhile, Khan has said his officers are \u201cworking closely\u201d with H&amp;F, which is committed to securing a better deal for the estates\u2019 residents. An <a href=\"http://questions.london.gov.uk/QuestionSearch/searchclient/questions/question_288743\">answer</a> from him to Pidgeon relating specifically to the Lillie Bridge depot, which also lies within H&amp;F, serves as a reminder that changes can be made to existing planning consents.</p> <p>It seems that all interested parties are in some sense reviewing the state of the scheme, which has vividly illustrated the perils and discontents of major regeneration projects that involve expunging character-defining local institutions, knocking down large numbers of peoples\u2019 homes and are heavily dependent on the vagaries of global property investment. Some parts of this one cannot now be undone, but much remains in flux. Here\u2019s a brief rundown of what\u2019s happening on the project area\u2019s four principal sites.</p> <h2>Lillie Square</h2> <p>This site on Seagrave Road is what used to be the exhibition centre car park. With a 50/50 joint venture between a Capco subsidiary and what Capco <a href=\"http://www.capitalandcounties.com/news/stories/conditional-agreement-kwok-family-interests-acquire-50-stake-seagrave-road-656m\">describes</a> as \u201centities in which certain members of the Kwok family are interested\u201d - the Kwoks are <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-17752115\">well-known</a> in Hong Kong real estate - has advanced more quickly than the other three due to being fully self-contained - separated from the others by Lillie Road - and having nothing large on it that needed levelling. Real buildings have been springing from the ground next to West Brompton station, just up the road from the Stamford Bridge ground of Chelsea FC. </p> <p>If completed as planned, <a href=\"https://www.lilliesquare.com/\">Lillie Square</a>, forming the heart of a theoretical West Brompton village, will eventually contain 808 residential units, including 200 of the 760 replacements for those just down the road that would be lost, though these would be hived off from the luxury apartments and their plush communal facilities. </p> <p>Sales of the market-priced properties <a href=\"http://www.standard.co.uk/business/capco-boss-says-doubts-still-cloud-london-property-market-a3241926.html\">have been slow</a>, with one estate agent telling the Financial Times that at this rate it would take Capco 150 years to sell all 6,000 of the market-priced homes it has permission to build across the project area in total. Will they drop their prices? What would be the implications for the rest of the masterplan, including the delivery of the 740 additional \u201caffordable\u201d homes, if they did?</p> <h2>Earls Court Village</h2> <p>An expanse of flat brownfield now fills the space where the exhibition centre stood, awaiting the construction of 1,300 residential units bisected by a linear park. The land is owned by Transport for London (TfL), which has formed a joint venture company - <a href=\"https://tfl.gov.uk/info-for/media/press-releases/2014/march/capco-and-tfl-establish-joint-venture-to-develop-earls-court-1-and-2\">Earls Court Partnership Ltd</a> - with Capco to do the developing and make money to spend on London\u2019s transport networks. None of the putative homes, which have yet to be marketed for \u201coff plan\u201d sale, are intended to be \u201caffordable\u201d. Capco has <a href=\"http://www.capitalandcounties.com/property/ec-properties/earls-court-west-brompton-village\">anticipated</a> \u201cluxury retail, dining in the park, culture, leisure and services for the modern day city-dweller\u201d being provided for residents of medium and high-rise blocks arranged round \u201ccourtyard squares\u201d.</p> <h2>Lillie Bridge Depot</h2> <p>This part of the project map has not yet been altered at all and may not be for several years - London Underground will have to relocate the depot\u2019s facilities to Acton before anything else can be built there, which will take time. The depot land belongs to TfL, which means the mayor will want at least 50% of the housing it may eventually contain to be shared ownership \u201caffordable\u201d homes for long-term renting first-time buyers. If and when that happens, who will TfL partner with to build the homes and how many will there be? Will that quantity contribute to the final number of additional affordable homes in the entire project area being greater than the mere 740 originally planned? That may partly depend on what happens to...</p> <h2>The West Kensington and Gibbs Green estates</h2> <p>The most complexity surrounds the 760 homes of these adjoining post-war estates, bordered at the western end of the project area by North End Road. Under the existing masterplan permissions, they are to be demolished in phases as and when replacements have been built. The slow progress on Lillie Square suggests nothing will get knocked down any time soon. But there remains a <a href=\"http://www.capitalandcounties.com/news/stories/capco-and-lbhf-sign-conditional-land-sale-agreement\">legal agreement</a> made between Capco and the now former Conservative H&amp;F administration to sell Capco the estates land for redevelopment as and when replacement homes are completed. </p> <p>The Tories\u2019 Labour successors have said that, regretfully, this deal <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/davehillblog/2015/sep/22/earls-court-project-what-will-happen-to-the-peoples-estates\">cannot be undone</a>. Meanwhile, the estates\u2019 tenants and residents\u2019 associations are hoping the communities secretary will enable them to take ownership of the estates through a community-led housing association and enhance the existing stock in line with their \u201c<a href=\"https://westkengibbsgreen.wordpress.com/the-peoples-plan/\">peoples\u2019 plan</a>\u201d. The council is against this, and Mayor Khan, while suggesting that his housing deputy James Murray <a href=\"http://questions.london.gov.uk/QuestionSearch/searchclient/questions/question_287999\">visits the campaigners</a> to listen to their ideas, wrote in June that he thinks the \u201cbest regeneration outcome\u201d for residents is more likely to be achieved if the council remains their landlord. He\u2019s said that GLA officers have been \u201cworking closely\u201d with those of H&amp;F to that end.</p> <h2>Conclusions?</h2> <p>What will emerge from all this is hard to predict. A fundamental issue is the extent to which the different parts of the project have been interconnected in planning and financial terms, with the extra \u201caffordable\u201d homes plus improvements to transport capacity, public realm and a new school all dependent on the sale of the expensive flats. Is the original masterplan still credible? The possibility of a new one being drawn up seems to exist. Where will Capco end up standing on all this? Where might TfL and the mayor want them to? </p> <p>There have been discussions between H&amp;F and Capco about making the development even bigger and grander in return for getting the estates residents a better deal out of demolition. They ran into the sand, but maybe Capco\u2019s \u201cup to 10,000\u201d suggestion means that type of outcome is possible after all. But it wouldn\u2019t suit everyone. Even if the estate residents were satisfied with it, other locals might object on aesthetic and quality of life grounds. The one sure thing remains that this story is still a long way from its end. <br></p>",
  "<p>It\u2019s 2016, and yet somehow ponderous Paul Kelly has still not been put out to pasture.

(One wonders how many suburban pubs Kelly has visited lately.)</p> <p>More perfidy and error comes from the direction of those Kelly refers to only as \u201cconservative ideologues\u201d. (We might wonder if he doesn\u2019t offer names because he shares a Holt Street lunchroom with some of them.) These people are accused of \u201cpumping her up as part of their fanatical campaign to destroy Malcolm Turnbull\u201d. </p> <p>With more contortions than usual, Kelly attempted to nominate a position between these two extremes. We must realise, he wrote, that the polling reflects a rejection of Islamic extremist ideology, and that \u201cmutual respect is vital but it needs to rest on a firm foundation that rejects both Hanson\u2019s prejudice and progressive denial of reality\u201d. </p> <p>It\u2019s the same boring routine with the same stock characters \u2013 the out-of-touch left and the extremist right \u2013 acting as foils to Kelly\u2019s own, allegedly pragmatic, centre-right position. </p> <p>In this instance, though, Kelly whitewashes the real lesson of recent Australian history: that conservatives \u2013 including a number of Kelly\u2019s colleagues \u2013 have mainstreamed ideas, resentments and prejudices that Hanson first introduced from the fringes of the far right. </p> <p>One artefact illuminates this point quite well. In 1997 \u2013 somewhere between the formation of One Nation that April and <a href=\"https://www.crikey.com.au/2014/11/21/guess-whos-back-top-10-moments-of-pauline-hanson/\">Hanson\u2019s \u201cassassination\u201d video</a> \u2013 a book was published called Pauline Hanson: The Truth. </p> <p>Issued under the authorship of one George J Merritt, its first half was a compilation of Hanson speeches and press releases through 1996. Its second half was a collection of essays by members of the Pauline Hanson Support Movement in defence of Hanson. </p> <p>Both halves show us the degree to which conservatives with mainstream credentials and prominent platforms have come to resemble the Hansonists of the 1990s, and the extent to which mainstream conservatism as a whole has moved in a Hansonist direction over the past two decades.</p> <p>One example is Hansonist anti-intellectualism which was fertilised during the Howard years, and has now ripened into an increasingly mainstream conservative appetite for conspiracy theory. </p> <p>Pauline Hanson: The Truth reprints a speech Hanson made to the far-right, pro-gun Australian Reform party in 1996, where she nominates a range of people who exist to \u201cdenigrate Australian culture\u201d \u2013 \u201csome of these people are leaders of ethnic groups, some are what I call academic snobs, some are in parliament, and some come from the media\u201d. </p> <p>In the second half of the book, a more conspiratorial note is struck on intellectuals by one of her supporters writing on \u201cThe New Class\u201d, described as a \u201cruling elite that controls, not only by armed force and money, but also by ideas\u201d. </p> <p>The New Class are \u201ccoercive utopians\u201d, who constitute a \u201ccognitive elite \u2026 primarily created by the university system\u201d. They are the \u201cradicals of the 1960s who have now become the liberal-left establishment\u201d. </p> <p>They promote a \u201cnew religion of internationalism \u2013 of anti-white racism, multiculturalism, feminism and Asianisation\u201d.</p> <p>An <a href=\"https://books.google.com.au/books?id=-DtPBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT9&amp;lpg=PT9&amp;dq=david+marr+howard+government+attacks+critics&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=qv4UCi391r&amp;sig=IWh4dkwCfWxG6E7j87P6VF9n1KY&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=david%20marr%20howard%20government%20attacks%20critics&amp;f=false\">increasing hostility to intellectuals</a> on the part of mainstream conservatives was borne out in Howard government attacks on universities, and eventually on any credentialled experts who spoke out against it. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Hanson\u2019s conspiracy-tinged contempt for intellectuals is now regularly expressed on the pages of the national broadsheet</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>More strikingly, though, Hansonist attacks on intellectuals came to be voiced by mainstream conservative commentators in the vocabulary of the far right. </p> <p>Kelly\u2019s colleague at the Australian, Nick Cater, disparaged what he called a \u201cnew class\u201d of \u201ctertiary-educated, middle-class professionals\u201d which \u201cpresumes to possess superior insights and manners to the broad mass of people\u201d and \u201celevates its own status by devaluing that of others\u201d.</p> <p>Soon enough, <a href=\"http://www.luckyculture.com.au/media-library/making-friends-with-the-fright-bats/\">Cater was putting this argument</a> in the vocabulary of \u201ccultural Marxism\u201d, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/feb/22/chris-uhlmann-should-mind-his-language-on-cultural-marxism\">a conspiracy theory</a> which itself originated and still flourishes on the far right. Cater said Bill Shorten\u2019s expressed wish to help more women to become MPs was derived from ideas which were a \u201clegacy of the thuggish, subversive world of West German political activism\u201d in the 1960s.</p> <p>This theme has since been taken up by others on the centre right including <a href=\"http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/inquirer/there-was-a-time-when-journalists-backed-free-speech/news-story/4704bea05341f9f674cb526470260601\">Chris Uhlmann, who explained</a> criticism of Tony Abbott\u2019s speaking engagements as an outcome of cultural Marxism. </p> <p>Hanson\u2019s conspiracy-tinged contempt for intellectuals is now regularly expressed on the pages of the national broadsheet by mainstream centre-right journalists. </p> <p>A second example is offered by the Hansonist approach to Indigenous Australians. Pauline Hanson: The Truth reproduces a long press release detailing the myriad benefits she alleged that Indigenous Australians then received and that white Australians did not \u2013 what she called \u201cinequalities between black and white Australians\u201d. </p> <p>This theme \u2013 resentment towards a dispossessed people \u2013 is not only repeated throughout the book. More recently, it has become an organising principle among mainstream conservatives. </p> <p>When <a href=\"http://www.theaustralian.com.au/business/media/andrew-bolt-x-racial-vilification-court-case/story-e6frg996-1226148919092\">Andrew Bolt came a cropper after questioning the Aboriginality of some people with fair skin</a>, it was in part because of articles that referred to awards, honours and funding that were accessible to what the court called \u201cfair-skinned aborigines\u201d. </p> <p>He was drawing from the same well of white Australian grievance that Hanson was in the 1990s. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/feb/22/chris-uhlmann-should-mind-his-language-on-cultural-marxism\">Chris Uhlmann should mind his language on 'cultural Marxism' | Jason Wilson</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Bolt became a cause celebre on the right, with the Institue of Public Affairs campaigning for him, and sparking an ongoing effort to repeal section 18C of the Racial Discrimination Act, under which he was successfully sued. </p> <p>In the Senate, Liberal party figures including Cory Bernardi have reached across the aisle to the One Nation senators in an attempt to change the act. </p> <p>Countless column inches in the Australian were devoted to supporting Bolt and decrying the Racial Discrimination Act. </p> <p>And wouldn\u2019t you know it \u2013 just last month <a href=\"http://www.theaustralian.com.au/opinion/columnists/paul-kelly/race-gender-the-risk-of-identity-politics/news-story/ee7e4ef3f632b6475ba215be60322908\">Kelly belched up a tl;dr attack on identity politics</a>, the internet and 18C because some people took Bill Leak to task over a cartoon that caricatured Aboriginal fathers.</p> <p>We can leave refugee policy \u2013 which has been entirely remade on Hansonist lines \u2013 to one side for now. Suffice to say that the resentments Hanson dragged from the far right into mainstream debate have become integrated into Australian conservatism. In turn, conservatives have made Hansonist positions part of Australia\u2019s political furniture. </p> <p>Paul Kelly shouldn\u2019t waste any more words, or time, trying to pin that on progressives.</p>",

  "<p>The NHS Digital report on the prevalence of mental health problems in England has laid bare the stark challenge we face (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/sep/29/self-harm-ptsd-and-mental-illness-soaring-among-young-women-in-england-survey\" title=\"\">Mental illness soars among young women in England</a>, 29 September). Record numbers of adults in England are now living with mental health problems, with some groups and communities facing heightened risks \u2013 notably young women, people in mid-life, BME communities and those living on benefits. One conclusion from the study should be that people deserve access to good quality support and treatment. It is encouraging that more people are now receiving services.</p> <p>However, we are a long way from recognising and addressing the factors that multiply the risks of some people many times over. Changes over the past decade have led to elevated risks for young women, people aged 55-64, both groups facing challenging transitions, and people depending on employment and support allowance.</p> <p>Solutions exist; we need the motivation to use them. If we were confronted with a similar surge in people with physical health problems, we would not simply seek to treat those who became unwell, we would also focus on prevention. To tackle the crisis in mental health we need to take a similar approach.<br><strong>Jenny Edwards </strong><br><em>Chief executive, Mental Health Foundation</em></p> <p>\u2022 The Guardian is right to ask for a wake-up call on the rising tide of mental illness among children and young people (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/oct/03/quarter-of-a-million-children-receiving-mental-health-care-in-england\" title=\"\">\u2018Wake up\u2019 call on children\u2019s mental health crisis</a>, 3 October).

It is so important to get them the support they need and this is currently hampered by a complicated and locally variable system.</p> <p>Jeremy Hunt says tackling the problems of mental health in children and young people is a priority for the government but we now need to see a joined-up approach across all age ranges \u2013 whether that\u2019s children at school or post 16-year-olds studying at further education and sixth-form colleges. Colleges and schools play a central role in tackling mental ill-health and if the government is serious about achieving parity with physical health treatment, then there not only needs to be more funding made available, but a joined-up approach across government departments, as well as local support agencies.<br><strong>Ian Ashman</strong><br><em>President, Association of Colleges</em></p> <p>\u2022 The reported increase in mental illness raises two key issues. First, it highlights the importance of diagnostic thresholds, which are changeable. Given that mental illnesses are defined by symptoms (rather than blood tests or scans), the key issue is: how does this person benefit from diagnosis? Does diagnosis help with understanding, treatment, wellness? This bring us to the second issue: what treatment and supports are available? You report that just one in three receives treatment in England. The World Health Organisation reports that only 25% can access treatment in many lower-income countries. We need to look after each other better and more.<br><strong>Brendan Kelly</strong><br><em>Professor of psychiatry, Trinity College Dublin</em></p> <p>\u2022 It is not enough to treat the mental health problems of children without digging deeply into the causes and planning prevention. The NHS never considers the impact on health of low incomes, and the Department for Work and Pensions did not consider the impact of freezing low incomes and cutting housing and council tax benefits on the health of families, in particular the health of women before and during pregnancy.</p> <p>It is impossible for a young woman to buy a healthy diet, estimated to cost \u00a343 a week, and other necessities when receiving \u00a357.90 a week jobseeker\u2019s allowance, which can be stopped by the Jobcentre for one or three months. That \u00a343 a week has been researched for the Joseph Rowntree Foundation by nutritionists at the University of York.

  "<p>Philip Hammond has pledged to champion the economy in the Brexit negotiations, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/03/uk-stocks-rally-as-brexit-fears-fade\">as the pound plunged to a three-year low against the euro</a>, after the prime minister appeared to suggest she would settle for a deal that excluded the UK from the single market.</p> <p>The chancellor told his party that voters had not chosen to become \u201cpoorer or less secure\u201d when they opted to leave the EU in the June referendum. Fellow ministers told the Guardian he is expected to push strongly to limit the economic price the government is willing to pay for regaining control of Britain\u2019s borders.</p> <p>City traders, who are scrutinising every hint from the government about the potential shape of a Brexit deal, took fright after Theresa May made clear on Sunday that she regarded control of immigration as central \u2013 something most experts believe would result in a less favourable trading relationship with the EU.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/03/brexit-tories-economy-philip-hammond-debt-targets\">Hammond is leading Britain into another lost decade | Aditya Chakrabortty</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Sterling has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/03/uk-stocks-rally-as-brexit-fears-fade\">hit a three-year low against the euro</a> and fell against the dollar, taking it within a whisker of the three-decade low against the US currency that was reached after June\u2019s vote to leave the EU.</p> <p>But Hammond, who has met scores of businesses to hear their concerns in recent weeks, struck a soothing tone in his speech to the Conservative party conference in Birmingham, and extended the Treasury\u2019s <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/03/philip-hammond-vows-to-match-lost-eu-funding-for-business\">pledge to maintain funding for EU-backed projects</a> after Brexit.</p> <p>\u201cThroughout the negotiating process, we are ready to take whatever steps are necessary to protect this economy from turbulence.

We are leaving the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/eu\">European Union</a>. But it is equally clear to me that the British people did not vote on 23 June to become poorer or less secure.\u201d</p> <p>He added: \u201cOur task is clear: repatriate our sovereignty, control our borders and seize the opportunities that the wider world has to offer \u2026 but do all of this while protecting our economy, our jobs and our living standards.\u201d</p> <p>Speaking in the wake of May\u2019s address to the conference, which <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/02/may-on-collision-course-with-backbenchers-seeking-soft-brexit\">appeared to hint that the government</a> was pursuing a hard Brexit without full access to the EU\u2019s single market, Hammond noted that many businesses were unsure about what lay ahead.</p> <p>The pound was down sharply against the euro on Sunday as traders digested the implications of May\u2019s speech, falling as low as \u20ac1.1434 at one point, the weakest since the summer of 2013. Sterling was also down more than 1% against the US dollar, to as low as $1.2818, just a fifth of a cent off its 31-year low in early July.</p> <p>Experts said sterling had lost value on expectations a hard Brexit would damage the UK\u2019s trading position and depress overseas investment in the UK. Such fears have been central in investors\u2019 minds after car company Nissan warned last week that its future in Britain was not assured in the event of a hard Brexit.</p> <p>The prospect of a hard Brexit would have \u201cprofound consequences across larger swaths of the UK economy\u201d, said economists at the bank Daiwa. \u201cOverseas firms invest here precisely because of the UK\u2019s access to the single market ... No doubt those firms that were putting in contingency plans to move some of their operations to other EU locations, so as to be able to continue doing business in the world\u2019s largest single market after the UK has left, will now step up those efforts,\u201d they added.</p> <p>Sterling\u2019s weakness contrasted with a rally on stock markets, where share prices were lifted by a combination of near-term economic optimism, relief over May providing some certainty on Brexit timing and the effects of a weak pound, which flatters the earnings of UK-listed firms reporting in dollars. The FTSE 100 index of blue-chip shares rose more than 1.2% to a 16-month high of 6,983.52.</p> <p>In his speech, Hammond promised to pay down the deficit, but to do so at a slower and more flexible pace. He will set out new spending plans \u2013 and revised economic forecasts \u2013 in his autumn statement in November.</p> <p>The scale of the challenge facing the government in resetting Britain\u2019s trading relationships became clear when Alexander Downer, the Australian high commissioner to the UK, spoke up from the audience at a fringe event to warn that his country would be unable to contemplate a trade deal with Britain unless it leaves the single market and customs union.</p> <p>\u201cFor us, there is a huge outstanding issue about membership of the single market and customs union. I don\u2019t think everyone understands this but it will not be possible to negotiate a free trade agreement with Australia, the US or others [if the UK stays in them] \u2026 If the UK remains in the single market and customs union, we will negotiate just with Brussels,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Theresa Villiers, a former cabinet minister and MEP, said he was absolutely right and the UK would need to come out of both.</p>",

She considers herself an American artist, as well as an African one, having studied art at Swarthmore College and Philadelphia University of the Arts, before taking her MFA at Yale, where she was also a teaching assistant. None of this was expected \u2013 she left Nigeria thinking she would become a doctor just like her father and several of her five siblings. Her earliest memory is of poring over her dad\u2019s Atlas of Diseases, fascinated by the human body. Yet when, aged 16, she added painting \u2013 a \u201cfun class\u201d \u2013 to her \u201creally intense and science based\u201d community college courses, her art teacher encouraged her to take it further. \u201cThat was my first painting class ever in my life,\u201d she says, clearly still surprised by how her life has turned out. Her teacher wasn\u2019t wrong though: she has since been awarded the Prix Canson 2016, the 2015 Next Generation prize at the New Museum of Contemporary Art, the 2015 Joyce Alexander Wein Artist Prize at the Studio Museum in Harlem, and was listed in Foreign Policy\u2019s Leading 100 Global Thinkers of 2015.</p> <p>Initially, her paintings seem reasonably simple, with their domestic scenes of living rooms, couples, families. But there are so many layers: the collaged materials she uses as background, taken from Nigerian popular culture, or portrait fabrics printed with people\u2019s faces from her family\u2019s weddings. Her marriage to a white Texan, Justin Crosby, is there too, with their difference&#xa0;in colour, in family background. Although that difference became perhaps too obvious for her. \u201cI&#xa0;felt I was making too many pieces with&#xa0;the couple in it, so then I thought, what if I take the couple out? How do I&#xa0;still say everything I want to say? I&#xa0;try&#xa0;to keep it interesting for myself because&#xa0;each piece is a puzzle.\u201d</p> <p>After growing up in the city of Enugu, Akunyili Crosby moved to a girls\u2019 boarding school in Lagos. \u201cI was used to spending weekends and summers with my grandmother in the village. Kerosene lamps only, so everybody goes to bed when the sun sets at seven, and there is <em>nothing</em> to do. Get up at 5.30 and sweep the floor with palm fronds. So I experienced those two spaces, growing up, then went to Queens College, which is probably the most prestigious girls school in the country. It really was my first contact with a cosmopolitan life.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"51d50294bffd36ce404bf6523102accf88ef6259\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/51d50294bffd36ce404bf6523102accf88ef6259/0_0_3500_4000/875.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"875\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">See Through, 2016 by Njideka Akunyili Crosby.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy the Artist and Victoria Miro, London</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The reason for this change in circumstance is quite astounding, and Akunyili Crosby tells the story with great pride. Her mother, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2007/nov/09/7\" title=\"\">Dora Akunyili</a>, who died in 2014, had studied pharmacy and taught at a university, among other jobs. Diagnosed as needing major surgery, she was given \u00a312,000 from a work insurance fund to go to London and have treatment. But the London doctor said it was a misdiagnosis, so she went home again and gave the money back. \u201cNigeria is not a country where anybody ever asks for your receipts,\u201d her daughter explains, \u201cand knowing how poor we were at the time, it\u2019s amazing that she didn\u2019t keep it.\u201d But Dora was unaware that the story of the incredibly honest pharmacist rose up the ranks until one day, years later, she got a phone call at home from President Obasanjo. He was desperate to solve the problem of counterfeit and fake medicine that was killing so many Nigerians, and asked her to help. Akunyili was made head of the National Agency for Food and Drug Administration and Control, took on frightening crime cartels and won \u2013 becoming a national hero.</p> <p>Does it make her daughter feel duty-bound to live a moral life? \u201cOh yes! I always feel my life in Nigeria is quite different from my life in the States. Every time I come back, I go from being anonymous \u2013 I hand my passport over and it\u2019s the same every time. They look at it, look up at me, say, \u2018Are you who I&#xa0;think you are? I hope you\u2019re like your mother!\u2019 And I say [she whimpers], \u2018I&#xa0;try!\u2019\u201d</p> <p>I ask her what Yale was like, but she isn\u2019t too keen to talk about it. \u201cHave you seen Mean Girls?\u201d she asks, comically, \u201cor the season of Project Runway where everyone gangs up on Michael Costello?\u201d Arriving at the Studio Museum in Harlem, a space for black artists, was her salvation after that. \u201cYale was not a community. But I think of the Studio Museum as a family.\u201d She says that almost every successful black artist in the US was nurtured there. In fact, she feels the debt so strongly that she recently gave them \u201ca substantial amount of money. I told my husband that in Nigeria there are two kinds of giving, and one of them hurts. I want to feel like I lost something. That\u2019s how&#xa0;much they mean to me.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.victoria-miro.com/exhibitions/496/\" title=\"\"><em>Njideka Akunyili Crosby: Portals is at Gallery II, Victoria Miro</em></a><em>, London N1 7RW (020 7336 8109) from 4 October until 5 November 2016.</em></p>",

We have watched in awe at his man-child tantrums and eruptions. We have investigated emails that the National Archives will never see. We have fretted about a candidate\u2019s bacterial infection.</p> <p>Let\u2019s be honest. We have not debated war and peace, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/21/death-of-neoliberalism-crisis-in-western-politics\">capitalism and socialism</a>, or even <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/surveillance\">surveillance and privacy</a>. More than anything else, we have simply obsessed about the psychopathic freak show that is the Trump campaign.</p> <p>Let the historians of the future know that the great Trump-Clinton contest of 2016 was much like the famous Seinfeld pitch to NBC: it\u2019s a show about nothing.</p> <p>In that sense, we have to recognize something profound about this point in time. The blame is not entirely on the candidates or the campaigns, or even on our own shallow nature.</p> <p>For this is an election at a time of relative peace and prosperity. Yes, it\u2019s true: peace and prosperity. And our failure to admit the obvious is hurting our ability to sustain an adult conversation about our politics.</p> <p>If you haven\u2019t already pressed the publish button on your comments below, or tweeted your outrage to the world, it\u2019s time to consider the facts.</p> <p>Yes, of course there are unacceptable levels of gun violence and isolated acts of homegrown terrorism. And the squeeze on the middle class \u2013 as well as the gap between rich and poor \u2013 is a profound challenge to us all.</p> <p>But back in the Seinfeld era, our cities saw far higher murder rates. There were the large-scale terrorist attacks of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/1995/apr/20/usa.iankatz\">Oklahoma City</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/jul/27/olympic-park-bombings-atlanta-1996-richard-jewell\">Atlanta Olympics</a>, the first attack on the World Trade Center and the embassy bombings in Kenya and Tanzania.</p> <p>The first internet bubble created millionaires and billionaires overnight, while the manufacturing decline that began in the early 1980s continued to hollow out the rust belt.</p> <p>So we rolled into an election at the end of the 1990s that bears a remarkable similarity to this one: a contest between two candidates who thrilled nobody in particular.</p> <p>A wonkish Democrat who wasn\u2019t particularly good at retail politics, seeking a third term after a popular and charismatic president. A simplistic Republican gun-slinger who promised a return to the Reagan era of even greater wealth and military superiority. Reporters (including this one) considered which of the two they would rather share a beer with. Meanwhile younger voters thought both candidates were hopelessly irrelevant to their lives and tiresomely similar in their politics.</p> <p>Of course the political differences between George W Bush and Al Gore were obvious and catastrophically so. As we now know, within a year of taking office, President Bush had decided to invade Iraq \u2013 a decision almost unthinkable for a President Gore. With a Gore White House, the US would have led the world on climate change more than a decade before President Obama struck the Paris agreement.</p> <p>But back in 2000, at another time of relative peace and prosperity, it didn\u2019t seem to matter whether voters cast a few ballots for Ralph Nader or even got confused and chose Pat Buchanan. And so the infinitely wise supreme court decided the course of the planet on the basis of 537 votes in Florida.</p> <p>The Trump-Clinton election isn\u2019t like 2004: a contest about national security, playing out in the bloodbath of the Iraqi civil war, while Osama bin Laden was still at large. It\u2019s nothing like 2008: an election that unfolded as the economy plunged into freefall in the middle of the worst financial crisis since the Wall Street Crash of 1929.</p> <p>It may have some echoes of 2012, when a wealthy businessman who liked the idea of self-deportation went up against a mainstream Democrat on issues of gender equality. But that was a presidential re-election effort, and both the president and the economy were very far from where they are today.</p> <p>Today unemployment stands at 4.9%. That\u2019s lower than it was during George W Bush\u2019s election in 1988, Clinton\u2019s re-election in 1996, and Bush\u2019s re-election in 2004. Four years ago, as Obama ran for the second time, it was 7.8%.</p> <p>The only recent election with a lower rate: Bush v Gore in 2000, when unemployment was 3.9%.</p> <p>Household incomes surged 5.2% last year, the largest gain since records began in 1967. If incomes continue to grow this year, they will have made up all the lost ground since the Great Recession of eight years ago and will be close to the all-time high reached in \u2013 when else? \u2013 1999. Gas prices are lower than they were in the last two elections, and the president\u2019s job approval ratings are above 50%.</p> <p>And while there are still thousands of US troops deployed across the world, not least in Afghanistan, combat deaths are a fraction of what they were in the last three presidential cycles.</p> <p>None of which is to say that this election should remain substance-free. After all, it certainly is not consequence-free. Donald Trump\u2019s election would throw the world\u2019s economy and its security framework into disarray.</p> <p>There are many factors to blame for this Seinfeld election: the capitulation of responsible Republicans to an extremist fringe; the small-bore politics of campaign strategists in a divided nation; and of course the brain of the GOP nominee himself.</p> <p>But you should also blame our stubborn inability to recognize the relative peace and prosperity that exists today. Until we turn the page on our mindset of recession and war, we are condemning ourselves to an election that is entirely Trumped up.</p>",

  "<p>An Italian investigative journalist, Claudio Gatti, has secured his 15 minutes of fame. He has done so by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/02/elena-ferrante-literary-storm-as-italian-reporter-identifies-author\">\u201cunmasking\u201d Elena Ferrante,</a> the bestselling Italian novelist who has been writing under a pseudonym since 1992. Gatti appears to believe that in trying to force a writer out of anonymity, he has provided some kind of public service. Ferrante\u2019s readers, he insists, have the right to know who she really is.</p> <p>I daresay there are bigger fans of Ferrante than me. However, I\u2019ve read all her books, visited Naples, because that\u2019s where they are mostly set, and holidayed on Ischia, because that\u2019s where Lila and Lena, the women at the centre of Ferrante\u2019s Neapolitan quartet, also holidayed. <a href=\"http://thegentlewoman.co.uk/library/elena-ferrante/\">I\u2019ve also interviewed Ferrante</a> by email, for the Gentlewoman, sat on tenterhooks with her publishers, awaiting the result of this year\u2019s International Booker, for which she was shortlisted, and am a contributor to the new edition of <a href=\"http://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/464300/frantumaglia-by-elena-ferrante/9781609452926/\">Frantumaglia</a>, a collection of writings by and about Ferrante that particularly seems to irk Gatti.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"93711546f4c044efb5ed2b32dc61043f3ef81a8b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/93711546f4c044efb5ed2b32dc61043f3ef81a8b/1_0_2499_1500/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ferrante\u2019s Neopolitan novels, My Brilliant Friend and The Story of the Lost Child.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ferrante\u2019s Neopolitan novels, My Brilliant Friend and The Story of the Lost Child.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Text Publishing &amp; Europa Editions</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But here\u2019s the thing. I do not give a stuff who Ferrante \u201creally\u201d is. If I have a right to know, as Gatti argues, I don\u2019t wish to exercise it. Gatti, as far as I\u2019m concerned, has violated my right not to know, while Ferrante protected it. I was more than willing to play my small part in giving this writer the space she needed to write as she does, and gratefully accept my reward \u2013 her books and the pleasure they give to me. I abhor the fact that this man, and those who published his speculations, rode roughshod over that perfectly satisfactory contract between writer and reader.</p> <p>Ferrante, argues Gatti, is really Anita Raja, a German translator who lives in Rome with her husband, the writer Domenico Starnone. Gatti is an idiot. Of course he is wrong. Elena Ferrante is really Elena Ferrante. Anita Raja is really Anita Raja. Domenico Starnone is really Domenico Starnone. Claudio Gatti, unfortunately, is really Claudio Gatti. Three of these are actual people. One of them is not, and has never claimed to be.</p> <p>There is a long tradition of women writing under pseudonyms, precisely because of the expectation of private domesticity that has bounded the lives of women. It\u2019s easy to believe, in these times when women no longer have to undergo such subterfuge to get a publisher, that such strictures no longer pertain.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/02/elena-ferrante-literary-storm-as-italian-reporter-identifies-author\">Elena Ferrante: literary storm as Italian reporter 'identifies' author</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Yet, actually, successful women are still expected to account for their ability to balance work and home. A <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/apr/06/women-foreign-reporters-ann-leslie\">female foreign correspondent</a> will be expected to account for the fact that she has to leave her children behind. A female prime minister <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jul/10/andrea-leadsom-apologises-for-motherhood-remarks\">will still face insinuations</a> that she hasn\u2019t fully experienced life as a woman\u2019s life should be experienced, because she hasn\u2019t had children. This is the way in which Gatti thinks Ferrante should be held to account \u2013 checked over, to see if her creative life is a suitable match to her domestic life. Successful women can\u2019t \u201chave it all\u201d, goes the mantra. We must be allowed to inspect this woman, to ensure that she hasn\u2019t managed it. With men like Gatti in the world, it\u2019s perfectly understandable that a person might want to avoid all that nasty, sinister scrutiny.</p> <p>Especially a writer. In Alan Bennett\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/nov/14/alan-bennett-diaries-lady-in-the-van\">The Lady in the Van</a>, it is made clear that there are two Alan Bennetts: the person living his life; and the writer, the latter having an entirely different set of motives and motivations to the former, which must somehow be balanced and reconciled. Some people chose to make that reconciliation by dividing their creative self from their private self absolutely as much as is possible. That is what the person who created Ferrante chose. Gatti appears to believe that such scrupulous delineation between work and life is somehow fraudulent. He is wrong. On the contrary, it\u2019s an entirely honest approach, perhaps the only entirely honest approach.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>With men like Gatti in the world, it\u2019s understandable that a person might want to avoid that nasty, sinister scrutiny</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>To write fiction of the quality of Ferrante\u2019s is not an easy task. She creates a world and lives in that world until her story is told. That\u2019s what novelists do. To remain grounded in the real world and also fully to inhabit a constructed world is difficult. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/hilary-mantel\">Hilary Mantel</a>, one of the great contemporary British writers, makes no bones of the fact that her husband\u2019s support is crucial. Ferrante needed the support of many more people to protect her creative self. Gatti thinks he knows better than the people who know and care for the individual that Ferrante inhabits. I very much doubt that he does. The future impact that his intervention could have on Ferrante\u2019s creativity appears not to have figured in his calculations. That\u2019s how much he really cares about Ferrante\u2019s readers and their rights.</p> <p>Listening to Gatti on Radio 4\u2019s Today programme on Monday morning, as he attempted to justify his vast, self-righteous intrusion, I was struck by how strongly he seemed to feel that people should be punished for their success, that somehow, by failing to subject her private self to public scrutiny, Ferrante was pulling a fast one. (The truth, I imagine, is more likely to be that he wants what she\u2019s got, and can\u2019t see why she should eschew the personal inconveniences that he would gladly embrace in her shoes.)</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/03/who-cares-elena-ferrante-italian-author-anonymity\">Who cares who Elena Ferrante really is? She owes us nothing | Suzanne Moore</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Gatti\u2019s expos\u00e9 consists almost entirely of scrutiny of the accounts of Ferrante\u2019s publishers. His argument rests on the fact that as Ferrante\u2019s success grew, payments to a German translator who worked for the house became commensurately larger. He also focused on properties purchased by Raja and Starnone with this money. The close link he makes between success and the material trappings of success is telling. Perhaps he believes that successful people are under some obligation to parade the material manifestations of their good fortune, to make their fame as vulgar and money-motivated as he has tried to make it.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"49f48b651ef6720142ee78482ae23bb8056cc091\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/49f48b651ef6720142ee78482ae23bb8056cc091/0_19_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"JK Rowling\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">JK Rowling, who once published under a male pseudonym, was also unmasked.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Suzanne Plunkett/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Ferrante, of course, did not know that she would achieve a readership large enough to eclipse all other Italian writers of her generation, when she began to publish her work in 1992, with the small publisher she has stuck with.

Perhaps Gatti cannot grasp or understand such a thing.</p> <p>I was struck by something recently, <a href=\"http://www.anothermag.com/fashion-beauty/9062/meet-the-another-magazine-a-w16-contributors\">when interviewing Christopher Kane</a>, one half of the brother and sister fashion-house team of Christopher and Tammy Kane.<strong> </strong>The two of them agree on many things, almost everything, which is what makes their creative partnership so fruitful. There is one large thing they differ on, though. Christopher says that business success, financial success, glamour, acclaim, is all part of the package for him, an integral part of the matrix of reasons that motivates him to work and strive. He is generally the public face of the label. Tammy says that she would make clothes even if no one ever saw them, just because she loves making clothes.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"26275110e4ea4705c91408edc6f6dac8d76b4a49\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/26275110e4ea4705c91408edc6f6dac8d76b4a49/0_33_1962_1176/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Christopher Kane (L) and Tammy Kane, the brother and sister fashion team\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Christopher Kane (L) and Tammy Kane, the brother and sister fashion team who have different views on publicity.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dave Benett/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The husband and wife film-making team of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/mar/06/ben-wheatley-interview-high-rise-jg-ballard-mark-kermode\">Ben Wheatley and Amy Jump</a> are similarly aligned, he happy to do publicity, she far less so inclined.

I daresay he would not be able to comprehend the stitching of a patchwork quilt, just for the sake of making beauty. If you want to work, achieve money and acclaim, then play by our rules. That seems to be Gatti\u2019s horrible message. Ferrante\u2019s writing is suffused with explorations of how aggressive and damaging to women such attitudes are. No wonder he wants to damage her back.</p> <p>In an article billed as a <a href=\"http://www.nybooks.com/daily/2016/10/02/story-behind-a-name-elena-ferrante/\">companion piece</a> to the \u201cinvestigation\u201d, Gatti describes the travails of Raja\u2019s mother, a German Jew who fled the Holocaust, as opposed to the description of Ferrante\u2019s mother, a Neapolitan seamstress. It\u2019s the discrepancy between made-up Ferrante\u2019s made-up background and real Raja\u2019s real background that is the foundation of Gatti\u2019s argument that Ferrante is tricking or gulling her readers. Leaving aside the fact that no one ever claimed that Ferrante actually <em>was</em> someone else, a person who existed, but only the constructed persona that a real person used to write novels, there\u2019s still something awful about this second piece.</p> <p>Gatti suggests that by creating this writer, with a background suitable to the works that she wanted to write, Raja was dishonouring her own mother, who, as Gatti, judged, was \u201creally unique\u201d. No doubt Ferrante didn\u2019t actually want men telling her what she should really be writing about, as Gatti presumes to. Why would anyone want to be told that they were doing something bad and disrespectful by failing to write about their mother and her family? The obligation to write about and talk about her own family, and be defined at least in part by a terrible past, seems to me like something else that Ferrante would have wanted to free herself from. Gatti, however, has exercised his own perceived right to put Ferrante back where he can keep an eye on her. It is a terrible and ghastly violation.</p>",

He is a crisis manager, after all.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/video/2016/oct/03/bob-bradley-named-swansea-manager-guidolin-sacked-video-report\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/55n9m\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2772652\"            data-video-name=\"Bradley named new Swansea manager as Guidolin is sacked \u2013 video report\"            data-video-provider=\"theguardian.com\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-57f24bb7e4b0ab00630876d5\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=11733780&amp;format=video/mp4\"/><source src=\"https://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=11733780&amp;format=video/m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=11733780&amp;format=video/3gp&amp;maxwidth=700\"/><source src=\"https://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=11733780&amp;format=video/3gp&amp;minwidth=700\"/><source src=\"https://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=11733780&amp;format=video/webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/video/2016/oct/03/bob-bradley-named-swansea-manager-guidolin-sacked-video-report\">Bradley named new Swansea manager as Guidolin is sacked</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>Given all he faced as Egypt manager, Bradley will likely view Swansea\u2019s current troubles as a storm in a South Wales tea cup. Appointed the Egyptian national team boss in the immediate aftermath of the Arab Spring and the uprising that engulfed Cairo, Bradley drew plaudits for the way in which he galvanised a divided country, becoming a symbol of hope and transcending his role as a football coach. Consider that the Egyptian Premier League was also suspended during his time as manager, following the Port Said Stadium riot of 2012, and his stewardship of the national team, only missing out on World Cup qualification in the play-offs and finishing with a 67% win percentage, looks even more impressive.</p> <p>From there, Bradley took charge of Stabaek, a club that at the time had only just won promotion to Norway\u2019s top flight. He left two seasons later, having led a club whose stadium only has room for 7,000 fans to the Europa League. France was the next country stamped on his passport, taking charge of Le Havre last December, having been sought by the Ligue 2 club\u2019s millionaire American backer Vincent Volpe. What is it they say about American football coaches not travelling well?</p> <p>He just missed out on promotion with Le Havre, but in truth, it felt like something of a holding pen until something bigger and better came along. Swansea City are that bigger and better thing. This is the opportunity Bradley\u2019s career has been building up to, but with that comes the pressure of not fluffing his lines. A public speaker of conviction and presence, lines are unlikely to be an issue, but with Swansea taking just four points from their opening seven Premier League fixtures, the task to avoid relegation is a sizeable one.</p> <p>There has been backlash to Bradley\u2019s appointment. Prejudice or not, the appointment of the Premier League\u2019s first American manager has provoked a sceptical reaction from some. \u201cIt\u2019s baggage,\u201d former USA international Alexi Lalas said in light of Bradley\u2019s appointment at Swansea, referencing how American footballers and coaches have to handle the burden of stereotype. \u201cUS players know it well. Performance can confirm/change perception and open/close doors.\u201d</p> <p>Indeed, there is a greater significance attached to Bradley\u2019s appointment. Along with David Wagner, Huddersfield Town\u2019s manager and a man currently linked with the vacancy at Aston Villa, there is a sense that a breakthrough for American coaches could be close. As Lalas says, success for Bradley at Swansea could open doors. Equally, failure could close them.</p> <p>Of course, questions over his suitability are entirely reasonable. Bradley possesses no previous Premier League experience, and the majority of his background rooted in American soccer \u2013 stints with Chicago Fire, MetroStars and Chivas preceded his appointment as US national coach. Many insist his dismissal from the top job, having led USA to the last 16 of the World Cup in 2010, was harsh, but it\u2019s true that his success, by and large, has come with small clubs in small leagues. Swansea fans are entitled to reserve judgment.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/dec/19/bob-bradley-le-havre-usa\">Bob Bradley at Le Havre: 'I felt like coming to a big football country'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>However, Bradley, the father of current US captain Michael, should be assessed on the basis of what he has achieved, and how he has achieved it, rather than who he achieved it with.

  "<p>Contemporaries said my husband, Geoff Hinchley, who has died aged 56, was so talented he could have excelled in any medical specialism. That he chose accident and emergency had much to do with prevailing attitudes in the 1980s towards gay doctors.</p> <p>Born in Barrow-in-Furness, Cumbria, the son of Derek, an electrical linesman and factory supervisor, and Margaret (nee Platt), a nurse, Geoff went to Barrow boys\u2019 grammar school, where he excelled academically and in sport. He then studied medicine at Charing Cross hospital, London. He was gregarious \u2013 running the student bar and compiling a notorious anthology of rugby songs \u2013 but always gentle and soft-spoken too.</p> <p>And he was entirely serious about his career. Junior posts in Jersey, Charing Cross and Plymouth were followed by an interlude as ship\u2019s doctor aboard the liner Ocean Pearl, during which he witnessed the aftermath of the Tiananmen Square massacre. The experience affected him deeply.</p> <p>We met in 1990, settling in Derby, where Geoff became registrar at the Derbyshire Royal Infirmary. The A&amp;E team there proved highly gay-friendly, and enduring friendships were forged. Geoff somehow found time to acquire a degree in medical law and to volunteer with the Derby Friend LGBT helpline.</p> <p>He finally became a consultant at Chase Farm hospital in Enfield, north London, in 1995, and was clinical director of emergency services there for 11 years. He remained with the trust \u2013 latterly at Barnet\u2013 until illness forced him to retire.</p> <p>A lifelong Labour supporter, Geoff was Chris Smith\u2019s fundraiser in Islington South at the time of the 1997 landslide. He stuck with Labour despite doubts over the Iraq war and was equally committed to the British Medical Association, serving on several committees and as a member of BMA council.</p> <p>Geoff was a caring mentor to his junior colleagues, but his passion for medical education took official form in 2008 when he became head of the London School of Emergency Medicine. He revolutionised the allocation of trainees across the capital, so that it was no longer based on historical precedent or old loyalties. His groundbreaking reforms generated some opposition but also great acclaim: as a tribute to his achievement, the London school is to rename its principal auditorium after him.</p> <p>Diagnosed with myeloma in 2013, Geoff faced his illness with determination but also with realism. He had a particularly virulent form of the disease, yet managed a full and active life style almost to the end. His final wish was to return home to Cumbria and despite the unexpected rapidity of his decline, his wish was granted.</p> <p>He is survived by me and by his parents, his siblings, Christine, Keith and Alison, and his nephew, Adam, and niece, Megan.</p>",

Therefore, it is important to consider the combined effect of the full package of our policy measures when assessing the impact of our monetary policy action on banks. </p> <p>Low rates put pressure on banks\u2019 profitability, particularly on banks which are very reliant on net interest income. Analysts forecast that negative interest rates will significantly reduce banks\u2019 profitability over the next five years, with the return on equity in some cases falling from 6.5% to 2%. </p> <p>Obviously, our monetary policy package consists of other measures as well and ECB staff estimates show that the <strong>overall</strong> impact on bank profitability of recent monetary policy actions is net positive, compared with a scenario with no monetary policy action<sup>[<a href=\"https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/key/date/2016/html/sp161003.en.html#footnote.2\">2</a>]</sup>. But we cannot ignore such analyses. And yet, one also has to ask if a bank that cannot weather headwinds over a few years still has a sufficiently robust business model to stay in the market.</p> </blockquote> <p>Mersh added:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Interest rates have to stay low until the economic recovery in the euro area has gained sufficient momentum to lift the inflation rate to a level in line with our definition of price stability. This is, however, taking longer than we had hoped, mainly because the necessary political changes to make economies more competitive and flexible are lagging behind. The sooner these reforms are implemented, the stronger and more sustainable the recovery will be. </p> <p>Although the notion of a \u201czero lower bound\u201d no longer stands, there is a limit to how low interest rates can go \u2013 the point at which the costs of lower rates incurred by the banking sector outweigh the benefits. Many consider that we have reached the \u201ceffective lower bound\u201d or that it might be not that far from the current deposit facility rate of -0.4%. </p> <p>This level I would still deem to be \u201cmildly negative\u201d \u2013 but I would shy away from moving into \u201cwildly negative\u201d territory.

Along with confirmation that the Government will trigger Article 50 by next March, this may have increased concerns over the ultimate economic impact of the vote to leave the EU.</p> <p>But there are a number of reasons not to be concerned about the currency\u2019s depreciation. For a start, it is far from clear that further indications of a move towards a hard Brexit should necessarily be strongly negative for the economy or the pound. They may, after all, reflect increased confidence that the UK can negotiate favourable trading arrangements with the EU without the conditions that a \u201csoft Brexit\u201d might imply.</p> <p>Second, the key driver of sterling\u2019s depreciation (against the US dollar at least) has continued to be relative changes in expectations for UK and US interest rates. As such, there are few signs of a general \u201cBrexit premium\u201d being attached to the currency which might prompt a more disorderly depreciation.</p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p>And finally, regardless of its causes, the drop in sterling has already had a substantial effect in cushioning the economic impact of the Brexit vote. Monday\u2019s Markit/CIPS manufacturing PMI survey revealed a further rise in the export orders sub-index to a level consistent with a rapid acceleration in the growth of actual exports in the coming months.</p> <p>Admittedly, the economy may currently be in a \u201csweet spot\u201d in which the beneficial effects of the pound\u2019s drop have been felt before the adverse effects on real incomes of the consequent rise in inflation. But provided that the pound\u2019s fall remains relatively orderly \u2013 our forecast is that it will fall from around $1.28 now to $1.20 next year \u2013 we expect the inflationary effects to be fairly limited and short-lived, allowing the policymakers to continue to support growth.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57f266bde4b0ff53b531bbb3\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/helenasmith\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-03T14:40:16.310Z\">3.40pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Greek pensioner protests overshadow budget unveiling</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Back to Greece where pictures of police firing tear gas at pensioners peacefully demonstrating against further cuts has caused deep embarrassment to the government \u2013 just as it tables next year\u2019s budget in parliament. Helena Smith reports from Athens </p> <blockquote> <p>The sight of protesting pensioners having pepper spray fired at them by police overzealously protecting the road on which his office stands, could not have come on a worse day for prime minister Alexis Tsipras. The leader, like all leftists in the ruling Syriza party, is painfully aware that it is pensioners who to date have paid the heaviest price for the austerity meted out in return for bailout funds. As I was told by many attending today\u2019s (otherwise low-key) rally, the latest cut was the twelfth they have been forced to endure since the beginning of the debt crisis in late 2009. To make matters worse, Tsipras\u2019 poll ratings are fading fast. In the most scathing survey to be published since he first assumed power in January 2015 \u2013 and in the newspaper of Avgi, the mouthpiece of his ruling Syriza party no less - the leader was found by the Public Issue polling company to be trailing Kyriakos Mitsotakis, chief of main opposition New Democracy, by 19 points in terms of suitability in the role of prime minister (42 percent against 23 percent). A whopping 36 percent of Greeks said they would prefer to see New Democracy in power compared to 14 percent for Syriza and its junior right wing partner, Anel. </p> <p>Which explains why Tsipras, who was otherwise focusing on what he hoped would be an optimistic draft budget forecasting growth and debt decline, personally called the pubic order minister in fury that the tear gas was used at all. In an unprecedented statement the ministry announced: \u201cAfter today\u2019s incident the order was given to forbid any use of tear gas at demonstrations of workers and pensioners.\u201d </p> <p>That notwithstanding, the episode duly eclipsed any talk of the draft budget - which foresees growth of 2.7 per cent n 2017, debt dropping from 180 to 174.8 per cent of GDP and unemployment falling from 23 to 22.4 percent next year \u2013 being tabled and debated in parliament. Greek media have not been slow to pick up on the fact that it also projects an extra \u20ac1.8bn worth of revenues in taxes \u2013 prompting many to say that yet more punitive belt-tightening measures are on the way. </p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fad7952f9f110336c6737afe6ab1ad11cbd6f9b7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fad7952f9f110336c6737afe6ab1ad11cbd6f9b7/0_0_4826_3205/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Protestors clash with police in Athens\" width=\"1000\" height=\"664\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Protestors clash with police in Athens</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: ZUMA W/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57f269d8e4b0328d7eb88c9b\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-03T14:25:39.387Z\">3.25pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Royal Bank of Scotland will pay Connecticut $120m to resolve a mortgage bond probe, </strong>according to Reuters.</p> <p>Meanwhile, as investors await news about whether the $14bn fine on Deutsche Bank demanded by the US Department of Justice will be reduced, the bank\u2019s US shares have now dropped by around 2.5%.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57f2682ce4b0ff53b531bbbc\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-03T14:17:42.344Z\">3.17pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The ISM report could also signal a reasonable non-farm payrolls number on Friday, says James Knightley at ING Bank:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Looking to Friday\u2019s payrolls figure, the ISM employment component has offered encouragement to us regarding our above consensus 210,000 prediction for job creation.

With populism gaining traction in many countries, the risk of political shocks adversely affecting the outlook for private investment has increased. At the same time, the capacity of central banks to engender stronger growth appears to be diminishing...</p> <p>With eurozone growth looking likely to have peaked in early 2016 and no significant changes to Fitch\u2019s UK and Japanese growth forecasts - despite significant monetary policy moves - the outlook for the advanced countries is best described as a low-growth, muddle-through path. Advanced country growth over 2016 to 2018 will be hardly any better than the lacklustre 1.5% annual average growth rate seen over 2011 to 2015. Moreover, downside risks to advanced country growth have increased.</p> <p>\u201cThe rise in populism seen in many advanced countries could be a precursor to increased trade-protectionism and growing fragmentary tensions in the eurozone, both of which would increase uncertainty and damage prospects for private sector investment,\u201d added [Fitch chief economist Brian] Coulton.</p> </blockquote> <p>On the US in particular it says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Fitch has revised down its forecast for US growth in 2016 to 1.4% in today\u2019s Global Economic Outlook from 1.8% in the July [report].</p> <p>\u201cThis year is likely to see the lowest annual growth rate for US GDP since 2009 as oil sector adjustments, weak external demand and the earlier appreciation of the dollar take their toll on industrial demand,\u201d said [Coulton].</p> </blockquote> <p>Fitch also believes central banks may be running out of ammunition:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Meanwhile, the capacity of central banks to counter adverse growth shocks may be falling. The implications of low and negative interest rates for bank profitability, the increasing complexity of central bank easing announcements, reductions in interest income for savers and market distortions are complicating the transmission of unconventional monetary easing to the economy. Furthermore, the historically unprecedented nature of negative nominal interest rates may be limiting the benefits of central bank easing announcements on inflation expectations.</p> <p>Rising political pressures and concerns about the effectiveness of monetary easing have contributed to growing support among policy makers for fiscal stimulus as a means of restoring growth. A wider shift to fiscal easing is increasingly apparent in the numbers and while its effectiveness may be hindered in some countries by high and rising public debt levels, a co-ordinated fiscal reflation is likely to have growth benefits, at least in the short term.</p> <p> The Fed is likely to be the only major central bank tightening monetary policy in the near term as it lays the groundwork for a December rate rise. With unit labour costs and core inflation measures suggesting underlying inflation close to the Fed\u2019s target and the labour market holding up, the conditions look to be in place for a continuation of gradual normalisation in the Federal Funds Rate. The ECB is expected to extend its quantitative easing programme beyond its current scheduled end-date of March 2017, and will likely need to adjust the limits on bond purchases. The new monetary policy approach adopted by the Bank of Japan (BOJ) opens the door for further cuts in the policy rate, taking it deeper into negative territory. This will allow the BOJ to steepen the yield curve while it varies its asset purchases to hold 10-year JGB yields flat at around 0%. We now forecast the BOJ policy rate will fall to -0.5% by end-2017. </p> <p>In the UK, the Bank of England\u2019s (BoE) aggressive easing package in early August has had a positive impact on sentiment. With recent UK data slightly better than expected, the BoE is unlikely to follow through on forward guidance to cut rates again before year-end.</p> </blockquote> <p>In emerging markets, Fitch sees signs of improvement:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Most importantly, China\u2019s efforts to stabilise growth in the face of a sharp slowdown in exports and private-sector investment look to have gained traction. Russia\u2019s economy looks to be stabilising after massive import compression, real wage adjustment and fiscal tightening saw domestic demand plummet in 2015. In Brazil, the impeachment of President Rousseff and installation of a new leadership team have renewed focus on fiscal reforms, which should support confidence and help the economy stabilise by year-end. </p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57f23db1e4b05962fdf4a67d\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-03T11:39:15.161Z\">12.39pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Summary: Factories fly, but pound slides</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Time for a catch-up, as City traders scoff down a quick sandwich before facing another volley of economic data from across the Atlantic.</p> <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/oct/03/pound-falls-hard-brexit-deutsche-bank-manufacturing-data-business-live?page=with:block-57f21706e4b0ab00630875ae#block-57f21706e4b0ab00630875ae\">Activity in Britain\u2019s factory sector has grown at its fastest pace since June 2014, bolstering hopes that the EU referendum won\u2019t trigger a recession</a>.</strong></p> <p>Exports, new orders and staffing levels all increased in September, as the weak pound helps firms sell overseas.</p> <p>Economists broadly agree that UK manufacturing appears to be in decent health right now, and helped the economy grow in the last quarter.</p> <p>Capital Economics, for example, say:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The Markit/CIPS manufacturing PMI for September showed that both the domestic and export-facing parts of the manufacturing sector are weathering the Brexit vote well.

Much of what he said was similar to what he said in a speech last week, making the case for free trade, but there were some new arguments in it. Here are the key points.</p> <ul> <li><strong>Fox said globalisation offered great opportunities to the UK.</strong></li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The phenomenon that we have come to know since the mid-1990s as globalisation represents an acceleration of the trend in which the world is increasingly compressed economically, culturally and politically. </p> <p>It brings with it an increasing interdependence that means we cannot insulate ourselves from instability in far-flung parts of the global economy. </p> <p>But it has also brought the chance to share prosperity, liberty and empowerment with millions of our fellow human beings across the world who had only ever known poverty, hopelessness and oppression.</p> <p>The ability to trade every minute and everywhere means that we have the opportunity to increase our links with those trading partners and markets who are functionally like us but not necessarily geographically close to us.</p> <p>Technological advances are dissolving away the barriers of time and distance. </p> <p>I have often said that if Francis Fukuyama had called his book \u201cthe end of geography\u201d rather than \u201cthe end of history\u201d then he would have been more accurate about the world in which we now find ourselves. </p> <p>I think the term globalisation could almost have been written with Britain in mind. It is an era where we have a tremendous opportunity to help shape the world around us for the benefit of all.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>He said the government should help those at risk of losing out from globalisation by focusing on improving people\u2019s skills.</strong></li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>He said \u201cisolationism and protectionism never end well\u201d.</strong></li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>He confirmed that Britain could not negotiate trade deals while it remained a member of the EU.</strong></li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>While we remain inside the European Union we are bound by its rules not to negotiate any new trade agreements, although we are able to discuss the impediments that we might wish to eliminate ahead of agreements we might reach with other countries when we leave.</p> </blockquote> <p>It is worth pointing out that this is quite different from what <strong>David Davis</strong> said <a href=\"http://www.conservativehome.com/platform/2016/07/david-davis-trade-deals-tax-cuts-and-taking-time-before-triggering-article-50-a-brexit-economic-strategy-for-britain.html\">in a ConservativeHome article in July about the Brexit strategy. </a>Writing shortly before he became Brexit secretary Davis said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>So be under no doubt: we can do deals with our trading partners, and we can do them quickly. I would expect the new prime minister on September 9th to immediately trigger a large round of global trade deals with all our most favoured trade partners.

As well as abandoning their own fiscal charter, this was full of the same empty promises George Osborne made, only with worse gags.</p> <p>The chancellor should apologise today for the failed Tory approach that has meant he has had to abandon the failed economic agenda of the last six years, an approach which has seen them dragging their heels on tax avoidance, an increase in child poverty and housebuilding falling to its lowest peacetime rate since the 1920s. The dangerous divide in society the chancellor mentioned has come about as a direct result of the policies he has voted for since 2010.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"850dd61407c2752e4ca2c2e3cbab71a66c309b8a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/850dd61407c2752e4ca2c2e3cbab71a66c309b8a/0_112_5256_3154/1000.jpg\" alt=\"John McDonnell.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">John McDonnell.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Leon Neal/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-10-03T12:41:42.826Z\">at 1.41pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57f24f66e4b05962fdf4a6db\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-03T12:32:00.187Z\">1.32pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The <strong>TaxPayers\u2019 Alliance</strong> has criticised Philip Hammond\u2019s speech.

Under Gordon Brown and George Osborne, this speech was always a highly charged event, combining forceful rhetoric with surprise policy statements that would set the agenda for days, weeks or even longer. Alistair Darling was less of a showman, but for most of his time as chancellor, the UK was facing a severe economic crisis, which gave anything he had to say an edge. Ken Clarke was less given to stunts, but at least he knew how to perform. Hammond, by comparison, had less fizz than a low-energy lightbulb.</p> <p>In news terms, the main point was what he had to say about abandoning deficit elimination by 2020 as a target. But if you listened to him on the Today programme this morning, he explained his thinking just as clearly, if not better, there than he did in his speech. Hammond did say that he might have to revise \u201cfiscal policy\u201d to help the UK cope with Brexit-related turbulance (increase spending or cut taxes), but he offered no clues as to his thinking and we are going to have to wait until the autumn statement to find out what he has in mind. The only other announcement in the speech was a guarantee that projects that receive multi-year EU funding will continue to get cash from the Treasury after the UK leaves.</p> <p>The rest of it was an upbeat assessment of the UK\u2019s economic prospects and a brave (but unsuccessful) attempt to make the productivity challenge sound interesting.</p> <p>Still, one senses that Theresa May does not approve of meretricious conference grandstanding. Being a bit pedestrian was probably what helped Hammond get the job of chancellor, and there is a lot to be said for avoiding the kind of flash policy announcements that can fall apart within hours. If you take the view that dull and boring is good in policymaking, then I suppose this was a triumph.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-10-03T12:44:35.870Z\">at 1.44pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57f23e3ee4b0ab0063087689\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-03T11:17:35.106Z\">12.17pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Hammond is on his peroration.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>When future generations look back on our decision in 2016\u2026</p> <p>\u2026they will see not the end of an era\u2026</p> <p>\u2026but the beginning of a new age...</p> <p>\u2026not a country turning inward\u2026</p> <p>\u2026but a nation reaching out\u2026</p> <p>\u2026decisively, confidently to grasp new opportunities.</p> <p>A bigger, better, Greater Britain.</p> <p>Truly, a country that works for everyone.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57f23e17e4b05962fdf4a682\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-03T11:16:51.014Z\">12.16pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>He says the Tories must \u201cresolve to tackle the challenges we face at home with renewed vigour\u201d.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-10-03T12:45:01.836Z\">at 1.45pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57f23df5e4b05962fdf4a681\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-03T11:16:14.993Z\">12.16pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Hammond is back on Brexit.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We are going to leave the European Union.</p> <p>To repatriate our laws.</p> <p>To assert the supremacy of our courts.</p> <p>To control our borders.</p> <p>But we are not going to turn our backs on the nations of Europe.</p> <p>Let us resolve that as we leave their Union\u2026</p> <p>\u2026we will remain the best of neighbours\u2026</p> <p>\u2026the closest of trade associates\u2026</p> <p>\u2026the strongest of security partners.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57f23d99e4b05962fdf4a67c\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-03T11:15:23.284Z\">12.15pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>But Hammond says he is also promoting a similar initiative for the Midlands - the Midlands engine.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The Midlands Engine, with its hub here in Birmingham, powers 11.7 million lives\u2026</p> <p>\u2026generates \u00a3220 billion of Added Value to the economy\u2026.</p> <p>\u2026.produces 18 percent of UK goods exports\u2026.</p> <p>\u2026.and more than a fifth of UK manufacturing output.</p> <p>In this great region, there are 320,000 more people in work than there were in 2010.</p> <p>But both productivity and economic growth have lagged behind the UK average.</p> <p>So we have developed our Long Term Economic Plan for the Midlands.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57f23d4be4b05962fdf4a67b\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-03T11:13:58.260Z\">12.13pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Hammond says he remains committed to the northern powerhouse, Osborne\u2019s initiative to revive the economy around Manchester.

But in this morning\u2019s interview she did not go as far as she did in the summer, <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-uk-leaves-the-eu-36940775\">when she suggested the House of Lords should block Brexit legislation.</a></p> <p>Wheatcroft\u2019s summer interview prompted this outburst from the Open Democracy founder <strong>Anthony Barnett. </strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Everything that is disgustingly cosy, self-regarding, privileged, corrupt and unaccountable about the way Britain is governed is represented by the House of Lords. The idea that it should claim a right to override the <em>hoi polloi</em>, shows a complete failure to understand what has happened.</p> </blockquote> <p>Barnett\u2019s Blimey, it could be Brexit! was one of the best accounts of the EU referendum and now <a href=\"https://unbound.com/books/brexit\">he is crowdfunding a follow up called What Next.</a> The Wheatcroft quote is from <a href=\"https://unbound.com/books/brexit/excerpt\">the introduction that he has already published.</a></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57f209e3e4b05962fdf4a572\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-03T08:17:37.093Z\">9.17am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Hammond's morning interviews - Summary</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Philip Hammond</strong>, the chancellor, has given a series of interviews this morning. </p> <p>Often at party conference it is the job of the chancellor, or shadow chancellor, to deliver the bad news. This morning Hammond duly obliged.</p> <p>Here are the key points.</p> <ul> <li><strong>Hammond said the economy would go through a period of \u201cturbulence\u201d during the Brexit negotiation process.</strong></li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We must expect some turbulence as we go through this negotiating process. There will be a period of a couple of years or perhaps even longer when businesses are uncertain about the final state of our relationship with the European Union ...</p> <p>We have to expect a period when confidence will go up and down - perhaps on a bit of a rollercoaster - until we get to a final agreement, where businesses and consumers can understand what the future relationship between Britain and the European Union will be.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>He said that, although the economy was doing well at the moment, there was a danger that business uncertainty would lead to investment drying up.</strong> Asked to rate the state of the economy on a scale of one to 10, and when it was put to him that the UK might deserve a five or a six, he replied:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Oh, I think we are better than that. From the data we\u2019ve seen from the first half of this year, this economy is running at eight out of 10, with high employment, strong growth, robust fundamentals.</p> </blockquote> <p>But he said that there was some evidence that trouble was looming.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Anecdotally we hear of businesses postponing investment decisions. And if we don\u2019t do something, if we don\u2019t intervene to counteract that effect, in time that would have an impact on jobs and growth. And it is to make sure that we can intervene to deal with that situation that we need to push back the target for fiscal balance.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>He said he was abandoning the plan to get the budget in surplus by 2019-20 because he had to be ready to spend more to support the economy during this period of uncertainty.</strong></li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>As we go into a period when inevitably there will be more uncertainty in the British economy, we need to have the space to be able to support the economy through that period. But we need to do that within a context that makes very clear that we will balance that budget, we will get back to a position of fiscal sustainability.</p> </blockquote> <p>There was a case for \u201ctargeted, high-value investment in our economic infrastructure\u201d, he said. He said investment in infrastructure would create jobs in the short term, and make Britain more efficient in the long term.</p> <ul> <li><strong>He rejected claims that he was now adopting Labour\u2019s approach. </strong>He claimed Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s economic policies were \u201cludicrous\u201d.</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We\u2019ve heard some very irresponsible proposals from Labour and we heard last week some ludicrous suggestions about borrowing vast amounts of money. And we know from experience that the Labour party, if it were ever entrusted with government, would not be spending this money on the most productive forms of investment.</p> </blockquote> <p>When it was put to him that, although he might not be adopting Corbyn\u2019s policies, he was echoing what Ed Balls was saying before the general election, he also rejected that claim - although less convincingly. Told he sounded like Balls, he replied:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I hope I\u2019m sounding like a Conservative pragmatist faced with a challenge of uncertainty in the economy, wanting to ensure that we support the British economy through that period.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>He said the government was still accepted the assumption that Brexit would lower growth.</strong> Asked about an Institute for Fiscal Studies prediction that it would lower growth by 4%, he replied:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>That is, despite the good economic data that we have had, still the central prediction of economic forecasters, that overall leaving the European Union will have a negative effect on economic growth ... That\u2019s the central prediction of economic forecasters and we have to take what they say seriously. </p> </blockquote> <p>But the prediction did not involve a \u201cone-off hit\u201d to the economy, he said. It was a forecast for what might happen over 15 years.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b68d26b724fddd956438272795eede1928cea7da\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b68d26b724fddd956438272795eede1928cea7da/0_162_4928_2956/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Philip Hammond and his wife Susan Williams-Walker at the Conservative conference.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Philip Hammond and his wife Susan Williams-Walker at the Conservative conference.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Oli Scarff/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57f207f5e4b05962fdf4a568\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/graemewearden\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-03T07:26:30.719Z\">8.26am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Pound falls as City faces up to hard Brexit</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Brexit worries have pushed the pound back towards the 31-year lows plumbed in the aftermath of June\u2019s referendum.</strong></p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/sterling\">Sterling</a> has lost over half a cent in early trading, dropping to \u00a31.2902 against the US dollar.

Cheng Chieh, 23, received three shots. The crime he committed was a frenzied, mass stabbing of travellers on a metro train, inflicted with a long fruit knife, which left four commuters dead and 24 injured in 2014.</p> <p>Cheng\u2019s final appeal had been dismissed by the country\u2019s supreme court two and a half weeks earlier. He reportedly confessed: \u201cI had to murder people so I would be convicted for murder and given the death sentence. Only then would my miserable life end.\u201d His mental state was the subject of intense legal dispute.</p> <p>On Tuesday, Keir Starmer, the Labour MP and former director of public prosecutions, the solicitor Saul Lehrfreund, who is co-executive director of abolitionist UK charity <a href=\"http://www.deathpenaltyproject.org/\">the Death Penalty Project</a>, and Dr Richard Latham, a consultant forensic psychiatrist, will arrive in Taipei in the hope of halting further executions.</p> <p>Their ultimate aim is to persuade the newly elected Democratic Progressive party government of president Tsai Ing-wen that she should abandon capital punishment, a shift that would signal the island\u2019s political distance from mainland China\u2019s practice of executing thousands of prisoners a year.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ec9dab2026c8ca2e7e881f813809c330277495c6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ec9dab2026c8ca2e7e881f813809c330277495c6/0_94_1464_878/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Taiwan president Tsai Ing-wen.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Taiwan president Tsai Ing-wen.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ritchie B. Tongo/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The problem is that, according to the latest opinion polls, 80% of the Taiwanese population support the death penalty. The challenge does not seem to deter Starmer. \u201cHistory shows us there are key moments when attitudes change, like the death penalty, or, for example, gay marriage.</p> <p>\u201cWhile popular opinion appears to be strongly in one direction, bold moves are taken in accordance with changing standards. You expect an outpouring of outrage but within a short time a new norm emerges.</p> <p>\u201cIf you said 20 years ago that the public would accept gay marriage, you would have got a very different answer. Rarely has the death penalty been abolished by vote, but it has been restricted by legal measures, then abolished; and that\u2019s been accepted.\u201d Europe, he points out, is now a \u201cdeath penalty-free zone\u201d with the sole exception of Belarus.</p> <p>Starmer is a founding director of the Death Penalty Project, and has appeared frequently on a pro bono basis before the privy council \u2013 the final court of appeal for many Commonwealth countries \u2013 since the 1990s to challenge the use of the death penalty in the Caribbean.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8225b875bfaf64e3a723e84c0ea92895c75d9350\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8225b875bfaf64e3a723e84c0ea92895c75d9350/0_113_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Keir Starmer\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Keir Starmer.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Graeme Robertson/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Despite alarm over the recent rate of hangings and beheadings in Saudi Arabia, Iran and Pakistan, the international trend is for countries to abandon executions. There are 109 abolitionist states, although seven retain the punishment for war crimes and treason. A further 39 states abstain in practice.</p> <p>Taiwan has 42 people on death row. Alongside the US and South Korea, it is one of only a few liberal democracies that supports judicially authorised killing of its citizens. When the present governing party was last in power, it introduced a temporary moratorium and drafted into domestic legislation the United Nation\u2019s International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), which prevents the death sentence being imposed on pregnant women or those who committed their crimes below the age of 18.</p> <p>That moratorium, however, was lifted when the government changed in 2010, leading to the execution of 33 people. The electoral victory this year of Tsai Ing-wen, Taiwan\u2019s first female president, has boosted hopes of converting the country permanently to abolition.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Rarely has the death penalty been abolished by vote, but it has been restricted by legal measures, then abolished</p> <footer> <cite>Keir Starmer</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The Democratic Progressive party emerged out of activist opposition to an earlier era of one-party rule. Human rights are part of its core values. The president, who is a lawyer by profession, has so far not committed herself either way.</p> <p>Lehrfreund says: \u201cWe are not there to dictate, we are there to assist them.\u201d He has been working closely with the <a href=\"http://www.taedp.org.tw/en\">Taiwan Alliance to End the Death Penalty</a>. \u201cWe hope Taiwan will show it is respectful of human rights and wants to be different to other countries in the region. That would create momentum for others to switch, perhaps Thailand and South Korea.\u201d</p> <p>Lehrfreund is convinced that popular support for executions is not set in stone. \u201cOnce you throw in variables about innocent defendants being mistakenly executed, then perceptions change.\u201d Challenging \u201cmisconceived views about the deterrent effect\u201d of the death penalty also helps shift opinion, he adds.</p> <p>The experience of awaiting execution can be mentally destabilising, says Latham. \u201cIt\u2019s termed \u2018death row syndrome\u2019. It has an incredibly negative impact. It resembles a depressive state. Depending on conditions and if you are kept in isolation, prisoners develop more severe responses such as hearing voices and delusional beliefs.\u201d As well as oscillating wildly between hope and fear, inmates overhear neighbours in adjoining cells being dragged away and never coming back.</p> <p>Latham will be talking to doctors about diagnosing prisoners and the way evidence is handled by the courts. \u201cPeople can appear superficially to be well but they may nonetheless be mentally disordered.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"373392f74992e051521bbcc32f076fa48f54820e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/373392f74992e051521bbcc32f076fa48f54820e/0_287_3419_2051/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Turkey\u2019s president Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan is among world leaders considering reintroducing the death penalty.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Turkey\u2019s president Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan is among world leaders considering reintroducing the death penalty.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Adem Altan/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Starmer is gratified that what began in obscure privy council legal hearings, has developed into Commonwealth legislation and now broadened out into an international campaign affecting every state around the world.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s for the government in Taiwan to decide whether it wants to move towards abolition,\u201d says Starmer, \u201cbut the fact that it has signed up to the ICCPR shows that it wants to do so in accordance with international standards. And that\u2019s welcome.\u201d There will also be discussions about Taiwan\u2019s plans to introduce a jury system.</p> <p>Progress towards global abolition may not be straightforward, Lehrfreund concedes. Both <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/rodrigo-duterte\">Philippines president Rodrigo Duterte</a> and Turkey president <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/recep-tayyip-erdogan\">Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan</a> threatened this summer to restore the death penalty, setbacks that may overshadow International World Day Against the Death Penalty on 10 October.</p> <p>\u201cThere should be a burden on any state to make sure they are not executing people who are mentally disordered,\u201d Lehrfreund says. \u201cIt\u2019s in the political arena that abolition will eventually happen.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>The pound has sunk to a three-year low against the euro on worries over the UK\u2019s prospects outside the EU, after the government set a timetable for Brexit negotiations and fanned fears it would go for a deal that leaves Britain excluded from the single market.</p> <p>Sterling came under pressure on Monday after Theresa May used her weekend speech at the Conservative party conference to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/01/theresa-may-to-propose-great-repeal-bill-to-unwind-eu-laws\">pledge to trigger article 50 before the end of March</a>. The prime minister raised the possibility of a hard Brexit as she spelled out that greater border controls would trump any attempt to remain a member of the single market.</p> <p>That pushed the pound down sharply against the euro single currency to \u20ac1.1438 in afternoon trading, a drop of 0.9% on the day. The pound was also down more than 1% against the US dollar to $1.2835, not far off a 31-year low hit in the wake of June\u2019s shock referendum result.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/oct/2016-10-03T13:00:14/embed.html\" data-alt=\"Interactive\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/oct/2016-10-03T13:00:14/embed.html\">Interactive</a> </figure>  <p>Sterling\u2019s weakness contrasted with a rally on stock markets where share prices were lifted by a combination of near-term economic optimism, relief over May providing some certainty on Brexit timing and the effects of a weak pound, which flatters the earnings of UK-listed firms reporting in dollars.</p> <p>\u201cBrexit continues to be the word of the day, with the markets somewhat caught between the future consequences of Britain\u2019s separation from the EU and the lack of discernible impact in the past few months,\u201d said Connor Campbell, analyst at the financial spread betting firm Spreadex.</p> <p>\u201cWhile the FTSE is celebrating the UK\u2019s recent, and unexpected, economic sturdiness, the pound has its eye on a time when Britain officially no longer belongs to the European Union.\u201d</p> <p>The FTSE 100 index of bluechip shares rose more than 1% to a 16-month high of 6,996.</p> <p></p> <p>The more domestically focused FTSE 250 was also up, by 1.6% at 18,152, boosted by a surge in the shares of Henderson, the fund manager, which announced a merger with the asset manager Janus. Henderson shares were up 17% at 271p.</p> <p>The mood was further bolstered by a poll of manufacturers that suggested factory activity expanded at the fastest pace for more than two years in September, helped by stronger export orders on the back of the pound\u2019s fall after the EU referendum.

  "<p>Welcome to this week\u2019s blog, and our roundup<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2016/sep/19/tips-links-and-suggestions-what-are-you-reading-this-week\"> </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2016/sep/26/tips-links-and-suggestions-what-are-you-reading-this-week\">of your comments and photos</a> from last week.</p> <p>Let\u2019s start with an enjoyable question from <a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/4794871\">HulloHulot</a>:</p> <blockquote> <p><em>How do folk feel about how text is oriented on spines?</em></p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p><em>Personally, I find the convention in the UK of the title starting at the top of the spine and running down along its length slightly weird. It might make sense on the level of an individual book, but as you browse rightwards along a shelf it means you\u2019re reading a listupwards rather than down and I find that feels like\u2026 Well, like crossing your legs the other way.</em></p> </blockquote> <p>I mention that question especially because of the fantastic answer provided by <a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/14661230\">simplicitydrifter</a>:</p> <blockquote> <p><em>The way I learned it at library school, the UK convention works well for putting a pile of books right side up on a table and then being able to read the spines easily as they would also be right way up.</em></p> <p><em>I feel a bit hesitant about leaving this reply as it doesn\u2019t really give a very intellectual impression of the sort of knowledge we librarians acquire during our Very Important Training does it?</em></p> </blockquote> <p>Who knew? Not me, anyway, but I\u2019m glad I do now. I\u2019ll be trying to impress dinner guests with that one soon. </p> <p>Elsewhere, I was very taken by this review from <a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/14928665\">WebberExpat</a>:</p> <blockquote> <p><em>Well, I\u2019ve finished Stoner in a rush. Maybe it finished me. What a kick in the ribs that book was. Magnificent, but gutting.... Stoner was the true antagonist, a man swallowed up by his own lonesome passion, walling himself off from the rest of the world pretending that his work will give him the fulfillment he craves. It won\u2019t and doesn\u2019t...</em></p> <p><em>The worst part of the whole book was the abortive qualifying exam for Walker. I\u2019ve sat in on those failures, where the self-assured winner crumbles into a heap of blustering obfuscation and confusion. It\u2019s even more horrific in real life, and Stoner is the only one, dammit, who does his duty as a professional and a teacher. That sonofa&amp;%*...</em></p> <p></p> <p><em>Next on tap, James Kelman\u2019s How Late It Was, How Late, which, by the looks of it, ought to be another happy happy joy joy of a book.</em></p> </blockquote> <p>Keep that whisky handy is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/sep/14/booker-club-james-kelman-how-late\">my advice</a> for the Kelman. And talking of whisky, <a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/13121203\">paulburns</a> has been reading one of the lesser-known books by one of the drink\u2019s most eloquent fans:</p> <blockquote> <p><em>Finished Kingsley Amis\u2019s The Alteration. A short novel set in an alternative history where there was no Protestant Reformation, not much of a Renaissance and not much of Scientific Revolution in the 17/18C, and the Catholic Church dominates everywhere except in the Schismatic New England in North America. Set in 1975, the joy of the book, apart from its being very well-written, is in the details of the alternative World Amis has created.</em></p> </blockquote> <p>More sober were a couple of glowing recommendations courtesy of <a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/2791828\">julian6</a>:</p> <blockquote> <p><em>A couple of superb works I read recently: Eventide by Kent Haruf - lovely measured sentences - sensitive and moving on small town America and the great John Updike\u2019s collection Licks of Love, also incorporating Rabbit Remembered. This final episode of the Angstrom family was as magisterial as ever. The finely observed realism - shows complete mastery of observation and an unfailing curiosity about the world - its social strata - its complex human geography. All this is achieved with cadences and sentence structure of such peerless beauty and repose. I was also disturbed and enthralled by Dave Goulson\u2019s A Buzz in the Meadow - a great exposition on the world of insects and the threats they face.</em></p> </blockquote> <p> There was also some fine talk of \u201cmixed pudding\u201d from <a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/1700934\">Vesca</a>:</p> <blockquote> <p><em>The latest Cambridge University Press translation of Sophocles\u2019 Antigone. I\u2019m sure it\u2019s highly accurate and great for study (which is the point, as I\u2019ve just started an MA with the OU) but for general reading - reading for pleasure - I would advise anyone to avoid. You\u2019d barely know it was meant to be poetry and little emotion is coming through.</em></p> <p><em>The Rose and The Yew Tree by Mary Westmacott (which was the name Agatha Christie used when not writing murders). It\u2019s an odd book - part fairy tale I think, but set in what was a contemporary setting when it was written (just after the second world war). The hero, if he is a hero, is jarringly prosaic and self-interested. The heroine, if she is the heroine, is wandering about in a white dress listening to the horns of elf-land faintly blowing. The narrator is looking back on events - so actually talking from a future that hasn\u2019t happened yet, which adds yet another lightly-sketched-in layer. The background is the general election of 45 and Labour\u2019s promise of post-war reforms versus loyalty to Churchill. So a real mixed pudding, which oughtn\u2019t to hold together as well as it does.</em></p> </blockquote> <p>Continuing the ambivalent strain is this hilarious review from <a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/13726489\">pearcesleftfoot </a>: </p> <blockquote> <p><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/sep/24/conclave-by-robert-harris-review\">Conclave by Robert Harris</a>: Dry. As. A. Bone.</em></p> <p><em>If you\u2019re into seemingly endless lists about Cardinal X from Wherever and Cardinal Y from Somewherever and such wonderfully descriptive writing such as \u2018A bishop, an African\u2019 then this is sure to be your thing.</em></p> </blockquote> <p>(Happily, Robert Harris also got some respect in the comments that followed. Selling Hitler was said to be excellent.)</p> <p>Finally, short and to the point from <a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/4692557\">exraf64</a>:</p> <blockquote> <p><em>Nausea, Sartre. I\u2019m planning P G Wodehouse next week to recover!</em></p> </blockquote> <p>Any week that features PG Wodehouse is likely to be a good one.

But that was delayed in the wake of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/eu-referendum\">Brexit </a>vote and now headteachers in West Sussex say they need a \u00a320m emergency injection of funds next April to tide them over.</p> <p>The mechanics behind a change to a four-day school week remain unclear, but leaders of the <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/WorthLessWestSussex/\">Worth Less? </a>campaign in West Sussex are hoping their warnings will focus the minds of government ministers, among them schools minister <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/nick-gibb\">Nick Gibb</a>, who is MP for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton.</p> <p>Parents are supportive of the schools\u2019 campaign and have signed a <a href=\"https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/167761\">petition</a> calling for additional transitional funding, but any attempt to reduce school hours is likely to trigger concerns about the impact on their children\u2019s education and the childcare nightmare it would present.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not a place we really want to go,\u201d said Peter Woodman, headteacher of the Weald school in Billingshurst. \u201cBut we are considering all the options and that\u2019s one option we have to consider. If we are trying to save money there are limited things we can do.\u201d</p> <p>This year, West Sussex children received \u00a344m less than the national average, and \u00a3200m less than the average London borough, where children from deprived backgrounds attract additional funding. In addition, increased pensions and national insurance contributions have cut school budgets by 8-10% year on year.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Other cost-cutting proposals being considered are larger class sizes, cutting back on cleaning and site maintenance, reduced spending on books and IT, a more basic curriculum and not replacing staff who leave. But some schools have already taken those steps and still need to find more savings.<br></p> <p>Responding to reports of a possible four-day school week, Helen Quiroga, parent governor at Felpham community college in Bognor Regis, said: \u201cParents would have quite a lot to say if the situation came to that.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>\u201cSchools don\u2019t like parents taking children out on holiday because of the impact it can have on their education over the years. If it was a case of children going to school for four days out of five and that\u2019s a permanent arrangement, it would have a devastating effect on their education.\u201d</p> <p>Quiroga, who has two children aged 15 and 17 at the school, said parents could see that headteachers in West Sussex were being \u201cpushed into a corner\u201d because of sustained underfunding and she supported the campaign for fair funding, but she said she would oppose a four-day school week.</p> <p>\u201cI know the school has worked very hard and has never had lots of money. All the staff work so hard. But I would oppose it personally. I can\u2019t imagine it, to be honest.\u201d</p> <p>The Felpham headteacher, Mark Anstiss, acknowledged the problems it would cause parents. \u201cIt would be terrible. I recognise the burden it would place on parents with the childcare costs and so on that they would have to incur if we did this. But we can\u2019t run the school the way that we have been with the money we get at the moment.\u201d</p> <p>When Anstiss became headteacher in 2010 he inherited a \u00a3343,000 deficit. He has worked hard to pay off the deficit and bring the school up from an Ofsted rating of \u201crequires improvement\u201d to \u201cgood\u201d, against a backdrop of increasing class sizes, less money for ICT, reduced GCSE and A-level options, and not replacing teachers who leave.</p> <p>\u201cI really am scratching my head to think about where we can make more cuts \u2013 all the obvious things we can do, we\u2019ve done over the years,\u201d he said. \u201cIt just seems really unfair.\u201d</p> <p>Louise Goldsmith, leader of West Sussex county council, has written to the education secretary, Justine Greening, asking for urgent government support to meet cost pressures until a new funding formula can be introduced.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>\u201cAs schools and academies in West Sussex are the fifth lowest funded nationally they simply cannot absorb more pressure on their budgets, which are already squeezed to the limit.<br></p> <p>\u201cHeadteachers have advised us because of the very difficult financial situation they are now facing, next year they may well be looking at a range of cost-saving options including schools moving to reduced hours. However, we very much hope this can be avoided.\u201d</p> <p>The Department for Education said the government was firmly committed to introducing a national funding formula so all schools were funded fairly.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>\u201cWe want all schools, including those in West Sussex, to have access to the resources they need so that every pupil regardless of background or ability can reach their full potential. That\u2019s why we have protected the schools budget so that, as pupil numbers increase, so will the amount of money for our schools \u2013 in 2016-17 that will total over \u00a340bn, the highest on record.\u201d</p>",

The prosecutors began an investigation the same year into whether the governor\u2019s campaign coordinated with conservative groups on advertising during the recall without reporting the groups\u2019 contributions.</p> <p>Those groups challenged the investigation and in 2015 it was halted by conservative-leaning justices who control the Wisconsin supreme court, who ruled that the groups and the campaign coordinated on ads that did not expressly call for a candidate\u2019s election or defeat. The state court said such coordination amounted to free speech and was not subject to disclosure requirements.</p> <p>The controversy attracted renewed attention recently when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2016/sep/14/john-doe-files-scott-walker-corporate-cash-american-politics\">the Guardian</a> reported that a leading manufacturer of lead that was once used in paint was among a host of corporate leaders who donated to Wisconsin Club for Growth, a conservative group that helped Walker and Republican legislators fight the recall challenges.</p> <p>Wisconsin Club for Growth received $750,000 in 2011 and 2012 from Harold Simmons, the billionaire owner of NL Industries. The company produced lead that was used in paint before such practices were banned. </p> <p>Walker and his fundraisers also solicited money from hedge-fund billionaire Stephen Cohen, who gave the club $1m; Home Depot co-founder Ken Langone, who gave $25,000; and hedge-fund manager and Manhattan Institute for Policy Research chairman Paul Singer, who gave $250,000.</p> <p>Walker, who briefly ran for the Republican presidential nomination, has called the information contained in the leaked documents \u201cold news\u201d and insisted he has done nothing wrong.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2016/oct/03/supreme-court-opening-cases-post-scalia-era-duane-buck\">The six US supreme court cases that could set the tone for the post-Scalia era</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Walker declined immediate comment on Monday through his spokesman, Joe Fadness.

  "<p>There was no Reddit or Twitter back in 1996. So when a young DC fan from Missouri named Geoff wanted to present his fan theory about the new Superboy to the world, he simply wrote to the comic\u2019s letters page.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019d love to see a meeting between Superboy and Supergirl.

But I\u2019m using the story to illustrate how the gap between a strong fan theory and a Hollywood screenplay might not be as wide as some might think. If you reckon the Johns story is a one-off, <a href=\"http://www.radiotimes.com/news/2015-11-05/this-fan-theory-steven-moffat-posted-in-a-chatroom-in-1995-became-a-real-doctor-who-episode\">how about a young Steven Moffat posting a Doctor Who concept in an internet chatroom in 1995</a> that he would later go on to use in the show himself?</p> <p>Then there are the fan theories that came true, like Jon Snow\u2019s resurrection in Game of Thrones, or the <a href=\"http://www.cracked.com/article_20793_6-fan-ideas-so-good-they-were-adopted-by-creators.html\">writing into canon of the theory behind the Klingons\u2019 sudden development of raised cranial ridges</a> between the end of Star Trek: The Original Series and their next appearance in 1979\u2019s Star Trek: The Motion Picture.

We\u2019re still well over a year from the release of the second instalment of the new trilogy and there are already dozens of new ones hitting the internet every week. </p> <p>More than any other film series, Star Wars lends itself to online guessing games, because the original trilogy was responsible for quite possibly the most mind-blowing twist in movie history, the revelation in 1980\u2019s The Empire Strikes Back of Darth Vader\u2019s true identity as Anakin Skywalker, father of \u0010Luke. With Episode VIII, like Empire, being the middle instalment in the new triptych, fans have already convinced themselves that another cerebellum-twisting revelation is on the way.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7ccccc807f704551768ff5d215a552b9535c1f27\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7ccccc807f704551768ff5d215a552b9535c1f27/0_275_3504_2103/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Adam Driver\u2019s Kylo Ren in Star Wars: The Force Awakens\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Double agent? \u2026 Adam Driver\u2019s Kylo Ren in Star Wars: The Force Awakens.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/Disney/Lucasfilm</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I\u2019ve read theories along the lines that <a href=\"http://moviepilot.com/posts/3745276\">Daisy Ridley\u2019s Rey is the reincarnation of Darth Vader/Anakin Skywalker</a>, presumably thereby allowing for the immortal Mark Hamill line: \u201cNo, Rey, you are my father!\u201d in the new instalment.

And these are just some of the less far-out concepts.</p> <p>The problem for Johnson and Lucasfilm is that the fan theory brigade are not just monkeys with typewriters, glacially working their way towards the inevitable truth with all the pace and urgency of the Sarlacc\u2019s digestion system. With the way Reddit, Twitter, Facebook, YouTube and a thousand fan forums are throwing up, filtering and pushing new ideas into the public consciousness, they are effectively acting like some kind of giant, super-powered fanboy hive mind (a much more Star Trek-y concept, I know) \u2013 and someone is bound to hit on the truth about Episode VIII sooner or later. The only way for the film-makers to avoid being second-guessed is to avoid any mirroring of the narrative arc of the original trilogy whatsoever this time out. And that goes against everything Abrams set up in The Force Awakens, which found success by restoring themes from earlier episodes \u2013 giant weapons of mass space destruction, Force-sensitive ingenues, wise, enigmatic aliens and shock character deaths \u2013 and heavily hinting that part two would resolve all its millions of irritatingly lost threads in thrillingly Star Wars-y fashion.</p> <p>I hope I\u2019m wrong here, and Johnson has a curveball up his sleeve that will shock fans to their very cores by combining laser-honed symmetry<em> and</em> prodigious originality. In the meantime, I\u2019ll be keeping one eye on the crazier corners of the internet \u2013 just in case one of those monkeys happens to deliver Episode VIII\u2019s complete, unabridged script.<br></p>",
  "<p>Five Chechen men have gone on trial in Moscow accused of killing the Russian opposition politician Boris Nemtsov. </p> <p>Nemtsov, who was deputy prime minister under Boris Yeltsin, had been a fierce critic of the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, and was set to lead a protest on 1 March 2015, two days after he was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/feb/27/russian-opposition-politician-boris-nemtsov-shot-dead-moscow-reports\">shot four times</a> in the back and killed as he walked across a bridge next to the Kremlin.</p> <p>The defendants, who were allegedly contracted to carry out the killing, all deny the charges.</p> <p>Nemtsov\u2019s family fear that whoever ordered the hit will not be found. Their lawyers told the court that the investigation was neither effective nor comprehensive. <br></p> <p>A lawyer for Zaur Dadayev, a former deputy commander of the Sever security forces battalion in Chechnya, who allegedly fired the gun, told the court that he was innocent. Dadayev reportedly confessed to the crime after he was detained, but later said he <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/mar/11/boris-nemtsov-murder-suspect-zaur-dadayev-claims-police-forced-confession\">had been tortured</a>.</p> <p>Another suspect blew himself up with a grenade when police tried to arrest him in Grozny in March 2015. Prosecutors alleged the men had been paid 15m roubles (\u00a3190,000) to commit the crime, but the murder weapon had not been found.</p> <p>Lawyers for Nemtsov\u2019s family said the investigation was incomplete and not all those guilty were on the defendants\u2019 bench. In several previous high-profile killings of government critics, assassins have been brought to trial, but not those suspected of contracting them.</p> <p>The prosecution lawyer Olga Mikhailova told the court: \u201cIt\u2019s necessary to establish those who ordered [the killing] \u2026 The motive for the crime has not been established.\u201d</p> <p>Mikhailova noted that Ramzan Kadyrov, the pro-Moscow <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/sep/23/putins-closest-ally-and-his-biggest-liability\">leader of Chechnya</a> and vocal critic of Russia\u2019s liberal opposition, had not been questioned. She also noted that no video of the killing had been presented, despite it taking place next to the Kremlin.<br></p> <p>Ruslan Mukhudinov, a driver for officers of the Sever battalion, who was charged by investigators with organising the crime, has not been arrested.</p> <p>The defence lawyer Zaurbek Sadakhanov asked the court: \u201cCan a driver order the deputy commander of the battalion to commit a crime?\u201d</p> <p>Nemtsov\u2019s associates and supporters have previously said the charges against Mukhudinov suggested an attempt to cover up the potential involvement of higher-level Chechen figures.</p> <p>Dadayev was a member of the Sever battalion until the day after Nemtsov\u2019s killing and security experts said he could not have committed such a crime without approval from the Chechen leadership. </p> <p>After the killing, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/mar/08/boris-nemtsov-five-suspects-appear-in-court-over-opposition-leaders-killing\">Kadyrov praised Dadayev</a> as a \u201ccourageous soldier\u201d and \u201cgenuine Russian patriot\u201d.

Her main political priorities are more likely to involve prison reform, the development of online justice, and imposing restrictions on legal actions against soldiers and the Ministry of Defence.</p> <p>Addressing the judges in Westminster Hall after the service, Truss said: \u201cI\u2019ve only changed tradition in one respect. I am the first lord chancellor to have a train-bearer today. That\u2019s because I am \u2013 as far as I know \u2013 the first lord chancellor to wear high heels ... But otherwise we continue as before.</p> <p>\u201cOur judges, many of whom are here today, are rightly celebrated for being independent, impartial and utterly incorruptible.</p> <p>\u201cAnd I am delighted to be working with a great generation of reforming senior judges, including the lord chief justice, Lord Thomas, with whom I recently published a joint plan for modernising the courts and tribunals.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Conviction, ABC\u2019s latest procedural drama, is a little bit like letting your toddler dress herself for school. Many of the pieces of the ensemble are great, but when you put them together, all you can see is a messy jumble, and the bad things distract from the good. It\u2019s a case of trying too hard with somewhat good intentions. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/sep/22/luke-cage-netflix-marvel-comics\">Luke Cage review \u2013 Marvel's powerful black superhero drama is bulletproof</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The best thing about the show is the premise: a conviction integrity unity (or CIU) that goes through old cases that are being disputed to make sure the system locked up the right person. As they repeatedly say, they are not the Innocence Project, but it\u2019s something akin. </p> <p>Its other ace in the hole is the leader of the CIU, Hayes Morrison (Hayley Atwell), a former first daughter who is caught with a bunch of cocaine and is blackmailed into leading the unit as a PR stunt by New York\u2019s district attorney, Connor Wallace (Eddie Cahill). Atwell, who was equally excellent in the sadly departed Agent Carter, does a killer job playing this party girl with a law degree who wants to pretend like she doesn\u2019t care about her job but is just too damn smart not to. She\u2019s funny, profane, ambitious, sexy and just about everything you could want from a lawyer.

Then you add that she and Wallace sort of hate each other but want to have sex. Then you add that her No 2, Sam (Shawn Ashmore), wants to steal her job. Then you add that the CIU has to clear each case in only five days for no apparent reason other than to add unnecessary tension. Then you add all the jarring visual flourishes and shaky shots of case photos on a whiteboard. Then you add the flashbacks to the actual crime during the investigation. Then you add the stirring musical montage at the end of each episode when the wrongly convicted are vindicated and get to re-enter the world. That\u2019s the toddler standing in front of you wearing every single thing in her closet thinking she\u2019s not going to get ridiculed at kindergarten. </p> <p> Since it canceled old warhorse Castle, ABC is on the lookout for its next great procedural and with an inherent case-of-the-week structure this could have been a home run. Conviction allows people to root for the underdog and feel like they\u2019re doing the right thing rather than watching another show about a talented man who is helping a female investigator put murderers in jail. </p> <p>Creators Liz Friedman (Jessica Jones) and Liz Friedlander (The Following) felt the need to pile on a bunch of tired conventions of the genre and uninteresting visual ticks, killing it before it could even get started. It\u2019s clear that none of the people the CIU is investigating belong in the slammer, but someone at ABC should be locked up for squandering Atwell\u2019s considerable talents once again. </p>",
  "<p>A Tory government will bridge regional divides, give young people a foot on the housing ladder and raise workers\u2019 productivity. And that is just an hors d\u2019oeuvre, according to Philip Hammond, who argued government intervention was needed to protect everyone from the Brexit fallout, especially when they neither voted to be poorer nor to face an uncertain future.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/oct/03/conservative-conference-philip-hammond-confirms-osbornes-austerity-timetable-has-been-dropped-politics-live\">The chancellor promised \u201ca new plan for the new circumstances Britain faces\u201d</a> as he junked George Osborne\u2019s austerity programme in favour of pragmatism.</p> <p>Revealing his soft Brexit sympathies, he made it clear that quitting the European Union posed the biggest threat to the economy and he was ready to use it as an excuse for significant spending plans. </p> <p>Not on his watch would the economy nosedive, wiping out many of the gains made in employment and rising wages over the last couple of years.<br></p> <p>He left the Conservative party audience in no doubt that while those ministers negotiating Brexit might be happy to wave goodbye to the single market, the chancellor wants to retain full access. For that reason he was clear the referendum vote regained control over Britain\u2019s borders and courts, but could not be a deterministic influence on immigration. <br></p> <p>He also explained that Brexit meant abandoning Osborne\u2019s pursuit of a balanced budget by 2020. Between several passages of praise for his predecessor, he conceded that the chase was over. Worse for the audience, one that only last year cheered the prospect of a budget surplus in 2021, no new date was set.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Then came the end of laissez faire, with Hammond following hard on the heels of communities secretary Savid Javid and business secretary Greg Hands, making the case for ministers to take an active role in the economy. </p> <p>Earlier, Hands said Britain would never win a race to the bottom and had no option but to support a hi-tech, low carbon future to attract major employers and big-paying jobs. <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-37540803\">Javid added some cheer to the proceedings with a \u00a33bn package</a> to support house building by 2020.</p> <p>Hammond\u2019s hand-outs were more modest by comparison \u2013 \u00a3220m for research and business start-up funding \u2013 <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/03/philip-hammond-vows-to-match-lost-eu-funding-for-business\">and the chance for firms that win EU grants to get a replacement grant from HM Treasury</a>. </p> <p>However, these figures, whichever way they are accounted for, are rounding errors in the budget and reflect the balancing act between the public\u2019s appetite for public spending and the demand for continued austerity. </p> <p>And that while this balancing act might mean ministers giving the go-ahead to long term projects like a third runway at Heathrow and HS2 \u2013 the high speed rail link between London and Birmingham \u2013 it will also mean a continuing squeeze on local authority budgets and the welfare bill. </p> <p>Hammond said nothing about the huge shortfalls in schools and health funding or how he plans to tackle the current squeeze on average incomes from rising inflation and declining wages growth.</p> <p>At the moment, consumers are confident the government can negotiate a smooth and painless exit. Hammond\u2019s speech is the first to make it clear that without full access to all tools in the Treasury\u2019s kit bag, from higher spending to business-friendly immigration, there are senior Tory ministers who believe smooth and painless is a pipe dream.</p>",

  "<p>A former police community support officer has been jailed for 24 years for raping two young girls after one of the children had a flashback when another officer made a routine school visit.</p> <p> Peter Bunyan, 43, from Penzance in Cornwall, was convicted of raping and sexually assaulting the girls when they were aged between three and six. One of the girls remembers him wearing at least some of his police uniform when he attacked her. </p> <p> Bunyan, formerly a PCSO in Camborne and Redruth, was previously jailed for having sex while on duty and for using police computers to collect data about vulnerable women. </p> <p>A jury at Truro crown court found Bunyan guilty on Monday of three counts of rape and one of sexual assault between 2005 and 2009. He was found not guilty of one charge of rape against one of the girls. Bunyan had denied the allegations. </p> <p>The jury heard it was only when one of the girls had a police officer visit her school that her memory was triggered and she began to piece together what happened before confiding in family members and school staff.</p> <p>Medical examinations carried out following the allegations suggested both the girls had suffered injuries that suggested they had been sexually abused.</p> <p>Sentencing Bunyan, judge Simon Carr said: \u201cYou assaulted them in a way that they would stay quiet ....

His appalling crimes robbed his defenceless victims of their childhood and could have a lasting impact well into their adult years.</p> <p> \u201cNo child should ever have to experience what the victims went through.

The club have been a hotbed of talent over the past 20 years too, with only Yorkshire having produced more than their eight Test cricketers during this time.</p> <p>Despite this on-field success story, the county have struggled to create a viable business in the region, with crowds proving hard to attract for both domestic and international cricket. That they were urged to build an international venue by the ECB, when granted first-class status in 1992, is an irony that has not been lost on many during the ongoing saga.</p> <p>The issue lies in their management of debt, however, and while other counties owe more \u2013 Yorkshire\u2019s, for example, is estimated at \u00a322m \u2013 Durham have found theirs unmanageable and saw an attempt to sell the private limited company that runs the business failing to attract suitors during the summer.

Namibia, South Africa and Zimbabwe, which host about a third of all remaining elephants, have stable or increasing populations. They argue passionately that elephant numbers are also suffering from loss of habitat and killings by farmers and that they can only be protected by making money from ivory sales and trophy hunting.</p> <p> However, a <a href=\"https://www.africanelephantcoalition.org/\">group of 29 African nations</a>, which host about 40% of all elephants and are led by Kenya and Benin, have smaller and plummeting populations and countered that poaching and the illegal trade in ivory is the greatest threat.</p> <p> Most African elephants already have the highest level of international legal protection \u2013 a Cites \u201cappendix 1\u201d listing \u2013 which bans all trade. But the elephants in Namibia, South Africa, Zimbabwe and Botswana, are listed on \u201cappendix 2\u201d, a lower level of protection. On Monday a proposal to add the elephants in Namibia, South Africa, Zimbabwe and Botswana to appendix 1 was defeated. </p> <p> Critics said the proposal would do little to protect elephants as all international trade is already banned, but proponents argued it was a crucial signal to poachers and criminals of a global crackdown on the illegal ivory trade. Botswana has the world\u2019s largest elephant population, about a third of all elephants, and it is growing. But it broke ranks with Namibia, South Africa and Zimbabwe and argued vehemently for appendix 1 protection.</p> <p>Tshekedi Khama, Botswana\u2019s minister of environment, said: \u201cThere is concerning evidence that elephant poaching is moving south. The criminal networks that facilitate much of this trade are highly organised and fluid, operating over several regions in the continent. Therefore no population should be considered secure. Put simply, a threat to elephants anywhere is a threat to elephants everywhere.\u201d</p> <p> The Cote D\u2019Ivoire delegate said it was absurd to have some elephants on appendix 1 and some on appendix 2: \u201cAn elephant that crosses a border may have protection on one side and not on the other. Elephants do not have passports.\u201d</p> <p>Lee White, the British-born director of Gabon\u2019s national parks and Cites delegate, said poachers were now shooting on sight at his rangers. The upgrading of all elephants to the highest protection would have sent \u201ca signal that we will come down as hard on poaching as we do on the trafficking of drugs, arms and people\u201d.</p> <p> However, Namibia\u2019s delegate threatened to withdraw entirely from Cites protections for elephants if the all populations were upgraded the highest levels. \u201cIt is completely fallacious that legal ivory trade covers illegal trade,\u201d he said, a statement flatly rejected by other nations. </p> <p>South Africa\u2019s environment minister, Edna Molewa, said rural communities must benefit from elephants if they are to tolerate the damage caused to crops and the lives sometimes lost. \u201cWe dare not ignore their voices,\u201d she said. \u201cTrophy hunting is the best return on investment [in elephant protection] with the least impact.\u201d</p> <p>The EU, which with 28 votes is a powerful force at Cites, also opposed the upgrade to appendix 1. It said that Cites rules meant the highest level protection is reserved for populations that are in steep decline, and that this did not apply to the elephants in Namibia, South Africa, Zimbabwe and Botswana. </p> <p>Some scientific and conservation groups agreed with this, including WWF, Traffic and the Zoological Society of London, arguing the integrity of the Cites was at risk.</p> <p> The EU delegate to Cites said: \u201cThe proposal does not meet the biological criteria. [But] this does not mean in any way we are not concerned about the decline of elephants across the continent.\u201d Several nations said cutting the demand for ivory, through education, and better enforcement against poachers were key. </p> <p> The issue was forced to a vote and was defeated, leaving the southern African elephants on appendix 2. Earlier on Monday, Namibia and Zimbabwe had attempted to legalise the trade in ivory from those countries.</p> <p> Namibia said its elephant population had doubled to 20,000 in the last 15 years. Charles Jonga, from the Campfire Programme, a rural development group in Zimbabwe, told the Cites summit: \u201cThe people in my community say: \u2018These elephants they eat our crops, they damage our houses, what benefit do we get?\u2019 If they get benefits, they will protect and not poach.\u201d </p> <p> But Patrick Omondi, Kenya\u2019s delegate, said: \u201cPoaching levels and trafficking in ivory are at their highest peak. History has shown the ivory trade cannot be controlled. We are reaching a tipping point and need to give elephants time to recover.\u201d</p> <p> Both Namibia\u2019s and Zimbabwe\u2019s proposals, supported by Japan but opposed by the EU and US, were soundly defeated. Observers believe Namibia, Zimbabwe and South Africa did not expect to unpick the ban on the ivory trade at this summit, but wanted to keep the debate open, in the hope of future success. Another proposal, from Swaziland, to legalise the trade in its rhino horn was heavily defeated. </p> <p>Many conservation groups wanted all elephants to get the highest protection, but Tom Milliken, an elephant expert from wildlife trade monitoring group Traffic, said<strong tabindex=\"-1\">: </strong>\u201cWhere elephants fall on the Cites appendices is inconsequential to their survival. All the paper protection in the world is not going to compensate for poor law enforcement, rampant corruption and ineffective management.\u201d </p> <p>He said the real success of the summit were measures to crack down on countries failing to halt illegal trade.</p> <p>But Kelvin Alie, at the International Fund for Animal Welfare, said the failure to put all elephants on appendix one was a disaster: \u201cThis is a tragedy for elephants.

Najjar said the interrogators forcibly inserted something into his anus. </p> <p>According to a footnote in the 2014 Senate intelligence committee\u2019s investigation into torture, John Brennan, now CIA director, was among the senior CIA officials briefed in the summer of 2002 on the interrogation plan for Najjar. According to the Senate report, the plan included isolation, \u201c\u2018sound disorientation techniques\u2019, \u2018sense of time deprivation\u2019, limited light, cold temperatures, and sleep deprivation\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThere was a barrel full of water, and they kept submerging [my head] in the water,\u201d the other Tunisian man, Lotfi al-Arabi El Gherissi, told Human Rights Watch, which shared the two men\u2019s accounts with the Guardian. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>There was a barrel full of water, and they kept submerging [my head] in the water</p> <footer> <cite>Lotfi al-Arabi El Gherissi</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Najjar said: \u201cThey would do this until I couldn\u2019t handle it anymore and I was on the verge of completely falling apart.\u201d</p> <p>El Gherissi and Najjar both appear by name in the declassified portions of the Senate torture report, which corroborates their CIA captivity, which began in 2002.

Najjar\u2019s account of having an unknown object repeatedly placed in his anus has nothing to do with nutrition.

In a description consistent with other accounts of water dousing, he reported being placed within a tarpaulin full of cold water that zipped closed at the top with minimal space for air. </p> <p>The CIA has maintained that it only waterboarded three detainees: Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, Abu Zubaydah and Abd al-Rahim al-Nashiri. Earlier accounts of water dousing come from Mohammed and 12 other detainees, none of whom are Najjar or El Gherissi.</p> <p>In 2015, a lawyer for a detainee subjected to water dousing told the Guardian: \u201cYou would laugh the next time you heard the government try to minimize its wrongdoing by drawing a distinction between waterboarding and other forms of water torture.\u201d </p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPCER8xSxKc\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/gPCER8xSxKc?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>Former detainees describe unreported CIA torture, in a video released by Human Rights Watch.</figcaption> </figure>   <p>A spokesman for the CIA, Ryan Trapani, told Human Rights Watch the agency \u201creviewed its records and found nothing to support these new claims\u201d.

Ambiguous figures have been a hot topic in Psychology and Vision Science since the <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15367079\">1800s</a>. A great deal of research examines how on earth the brain turns the patchy deluge of stimuli bombarding the retina into a coherent, three-dimensional mental representation of the world. Ambiguous figures are interesting because they are thought to be a nice clean example of exactly the sort of ambiguity that the brain has to deal with moment to moment. </p> <p>The main debate centres on whether reversals occur because of bottom-up perceptual processes or top-down cognitive processes. In the Necker Cube example above, focusing on corner 1 may cause that corner to appear slightly closer, dragging the rest of the cube behind it and causing the perception of it changing in <a href=\"http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00200985\">depth</a>. This is one piece of evidence that reversals occur through bottom-up perception. However, reversals also occur if the eyes are kept <a href=\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042698905005201\">fixated</a> on a single point, so this can\u2019t be the whole story. </p> <p>Reversals only occur if the observer <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7985524\">knows</a> there is an alternative interpretation and you can often make your perception reverse by simply <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15367079\">imagining</a> the alternative. You can also <a href=\"http://link.springer.com/article/10.3758/BF03208780\">prime</a> people to see one interpretation quicker than the other. These findings are seen as evidence that top-down cognitive processes have a role in reversals. </p> <p>Interestingly, children don\u2019t spontaneously experience reversals when looking at ambiguous figures until about five years of age, even when the two interpretations have been clearly pointed out to them. Experiencing reversals correlates with passing other tasks that require children to recognise that a single object or event can have multiple interpretations, as with homonyms, synonyms and understanding that others can have beliefs different from their own. </p> <p>And experiencing reversals may be linked to development of the <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18775448\">corpus callosum</a>, a thick band of nerves connecting the two hemispheres of the brain. Children do not experience the same rate of reversals as adults until the corpus callosum is fully developed at around 10 years of age. Children born with a damaged or missing corpus callosum experience very few reversals at all. </p> <p>So although ambiguous figures have received a great deal of research attention, it is still unclear why we experience them as flipping from one interpretation to the other. Current <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15367079\">theories</a> suggest that it is a combination of both bottom-up perceptual processes and top-down cognitive control that is at work, but how much each of those contribute to the experience remains unclear. In many ways, the data are as ambiguous and intriguing as the figures themselves. </p>",
  "<p>Women wearing black clothes and waving black flags are demonstrating across Poland, boycotting their jobs and classes as part of a nationwide strike in protest against a new law that would in effect ban abortion.</p> <p>Many men also took part in demonstrations on the streets of Warsaw, Gda\u0144sk and elsewhere across the largely Catholic nation. </p> <p>Thousands of people also protested on Saturday in front of the parliament in Warsaw.

Doctors found to have assisted with a termination would also be liable for prosecution and a prison term.</p> <p>Critics say that even a woman who suffers a miscarriage could be under criminal suspicion, and that doctors might be put off conducting routine procedures on pregnant women for fear of being accused of facilitating a termination.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/02/women-to-go-on-strike-in-poland-abortion-law\">Women to go on strike in Poland in protest at planned abortion law</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Although a ban has received public support from elements within the Catholic church and Poland\u2019s ruling rightwing Law and Justice party (PiS), neither initiated the proposals.

Coffee shops were filled with groups of women dressed head to toe in black. </p> <p>Agnieszka Krysztopolska, a 34-year-old banker, was sitting with several friends who were all boycotting work. \u201cI have two children and it\u2019s not like I am some kind of hardline feminist but I do not agree with somebody depriving me of the right to my own health or that of my children. I think this bill is just dangerous,\u201d she said.</p> <p> Nearby, 28-year-old Magdalena Gwozdz chatted with her 17-year-old sister, who was boycotting school. \u201cThis should be a woman\u2019s choice and abortion should be available in case of rape or a damaged foetus,\u201d Gwozdz said. \u201cThis is Europe and we are in the European Union.\u201d</p> <p>The private news broadcaster TVN24, with some of its own presenters in black, showed images of establishments joining the strike, including a restaurant in Wroc\u0142aw that closed to let female employees participate and a museum in Krakow where none of the women showed up to work. </p> <p>In Cz\u0119stochowa, perhaps the most Catholic city in the overwhelmingly Catholic nation, the city hall reported that 60% of female workers had not turned up to work.</p> <p>Pro-choice activists called for the strike, or \u201cnational absence campaign\u201d, after the Polish parliament voted on 23 September for Stop Abortion\u2019s proposals to be scrutinised by a parliamentary committee.

  "<p>Meat produced from British pigs has been shown to be infected with a livestock strain of MRSA, the Guardian can reveal, raising concerns that the UK is on the brink of another food scandal.</p> <p>Tests on a sample of 97 UK-produced pork products from supermarkets show that three \u2013 sold at Asda and Sainsbury\u2019s \u2013 were contaminated with the superbug strain which can cause serious health problems. </p> <p>The Guardian, working with the Bureau of Investigative Journalism (BIJ), has also established that a loophole in import regulations is leaving an open door for MRSA CC398-infected live pigs from countries such as Denmark, where the disease is rife.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/jun/18/what-is-the-superbug-la-mrsa-cc398-and-why-is-it-spreading-on-farms\">What is the superbug LA-MRSA CC398 and why is it spreading on farms?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The findings have serious implications for human health. MRSA CC398 is a potentially deadly bacteria which can be resistant to even the strongest antibiotics. It is less harmful to humans than the MRSA bug that kills about 300 people in hospitals in England and Wales each year. But it causes unpleasant persistent infections and can seriously harm people with compromised immune systems, such as those already suffering other illness.</p> <p>It is known to have been responsible for at least six deaths in Denmark, though that is likely to be the tip of the iceberg. People can contract the disease from infected meat, and from infected animals.</p> <p>The superbug, like other foodborne germs, is killed by thorough cooking - but it can be passed on through lapses in hygiene. Workers on pig farms can also catch the disease from infected animals and pass it on to other people.</p> <p>Without action to halt it, the spread of the bug could follow the pattern in Denmark, where MRSA CC398 became established over a decade, now afflicts about two-thirds of pig farms and is viewed as a major public health crisis, with 12,000 people believed to have contracted it. Currently, there is no screening programme for MRSA CC398 on British farms.</p> <p>Prof Tim Lang, of the Centre for Food Policy at City University in London, said: \u201cIf we don\u2019t have tight infection control and we don\u2019t try to control the movement of live animals, infection can spread. The British are up in arms about the movement of people, but the EU also has a large movement of animals. We need biosecurity, we need to tighten up this livestock movement. You may get cheap meat, but in the long term it\u2019s going to add to your public health problems.\u201d</p> <p>Prof Erik Millstone of Sussex University added that the emergence of antibiotic-resistant superbugs from agriculture was \u201ca huge threat to human health\u201d and that there was a clear risk that MRSA CC398 could spread among British livestock herds and to people. He anticipated that the government would downplay this risk but warned: \u201cWhile the [government] tries its customary tactics of blaming the victim, it won\u2019t work.\u201d</p> <p>The tests were carried out by Dr Mark Holmes, director of studies in clinical veterinary medicine at Churchill College, Cambridge University, and commissioned by the Alliance to Save Our Antibiotics, founded by the Soil Association, Compassion in World Farming and Sustain. Two samples of minced pork from Asda and one from Sainsbury\u2019s were found positive.</p> <p>Last year, tests by the Guardian on 100 samples of pork in UK supermarkets, including a mix of imported and UK-bred meat, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/jun/18/mrsa-superbug-in-supermarket-pork-raises-alarm-farming-risks\">found nine contained the superbug</a>. However, all but one of the infected products were of Danish origin, the other Irish. That investigation marked the first time MRSA CC398 had been publicly found in products in UK supermarkets.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/video/2015/jun/18/superbugs-la-mrsa-pigs-antibiotics-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/49pcd\"                        data-video-id=\"2321473\"            data-video-name=\"The pig superbug and the baby \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"guardian.co.uk\"            data-video-poster=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/19/1434715839458/Superbug-baby-012.jpg\"> <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-457181063\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/19/1434715839458/Superbug-baby-012.jpg\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2015/06/19/150616SuperBugsFridge2_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2015/06/19/150616SuperBugsFridge2_synd_768k_vp8.webm\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2015/06/19/150616SuperBugsFridge2.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2015/06/19/150616SuperBugsFridge2_large.3gp\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2015/06/19/150616SuperBugsFridge2_small.3gp\"/> </video> <figcaption>Watch the Guardian\u2019s investigation into how intensive pig farming is accelerating an antibiotic crisis.</figcaption> </figure>   <p>Today\u2019s follow-up tests are the first to name supermarkets whose UK-produced pork has been contaminated with the superbug. It is not possible to say whether these products originally came from imported pigs, or whether UK pig herds have been infected through imports. Either way, imports are likely to be the main agent spreading the disease, as the UK\u2019s pork production has remained relatively free from MRSA CC398 until now, and the main method of spreading the disease is from animal-to-animal contact on farms.</p> <p>At least one regular Danish supplier of imported pigs to the UK was found to be contaminated with the drug-resistant bacteria in 2014, the Bureau of Investigative Journalism has established. The company \u2013Breeding Centre R\u00f8nshauge A/S \u2013 refused to say how many pigs it had exported to the UK and whether they could have been contaminated. But official export figures show that the company supplied 41 pigs to the UK in July this year, 65 in 2013 and 16 in 2012.</p> <p>But the UK government does not screen for the infection in imported animals, citing a low risk of serious illness. The main initial effect is a nasty skin infection that is disfiguring, unpleasant and highly infectious, but not fatal.</p> <p>Emma Rose, from the Alliance to Save Our Antibiotics, said: \u201cIt is extremely worrying to find LA [livestock-associated]-MRSA in British-produced pork.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cScientists are now warning that the extensive MRSA reservoir in animals could ultimately lead to a pandemic spread in the human population. LA-MRSA is able to cause serious and potentially fatal infections in humans, and as the bacteria is resistant to antibiotics, it is extremely difficult to treat. What\u2019s more, even more dangerous variations are emerging as the superbug evolves.\u201d</p> <p>The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) said: \u201cLivestock-associated MRSA is not the same as MRSA strains that can cause healthcare-associated infections and if meat is handled and prepared properly the risk to people is low. Defra and the National Pig Association recommend that pigs imported to Britain are screened for LA-MRSA.</p> <p>\u201cThe government is reviewing options for surveillance, which will be proportionate to the very low health risk posed by livestock-associated MRSA.\u201d</p> <p>Asda said:<strong> </strong>\u201cOur customers can be assured that we are working closely with industry groups and farmers to make sure that antibiotics are used responsibly in farm animals.\u201d Sainsbury\u2019s told the Guardian that MRSA CC398 was \u201cvery uncommon\u201d in British pork and that it worked with farmers \u201cto ensure antibiotics are used responsibly and are taking advice from leading industry experts\u201d.</p> <p>The rise of the CC398 variant has been linked to the overuse of antibiotics in factory farming, where often cramped and dirty conditions allow disease to flourish and farmers become dependent on frequent doses of antibiotics.</p> <p>The threat from imports of live animals has been overlooked, according to experts. When animals are imported, they have to undergo screening for a variety of other diseases, but screening for MRSA CC398 is purely voluntary. As a result, there is no way of knowing how many infected animals may have been brought to Britain.</p> <p>There have been at least two confirmed cases of the disease found at UK pig farms, one of them in Northern Ireland and the other in eastern England. However, as no systematic tests are carried out on UK farms, it is impossible to know how many may harbour the bug.</p> <p>Defra does not collate statistics on the number of farm animals imported, but figures from the Danish government show the UK imported more than 3,000 breeding pigs from the country in the past six years, including 916 in 2013, 598 the following year and 283 last year.</p> <p>In the last three years, the UK food industry has been rocked with revelations from the Guardian of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/may/28/supermarket-chickens-contaminated-campylobacter\">campylobacter in chicken</a>, which can cause serious illness, stronger versions of salmonella with greater resistance, and of drug-resistant forms of E coli, recently found in one in four supermarket chickens, that thwart all but the strongest antibiotics. Most of the problems are thought to be down to the pressure towards factory farms producing the cheapest possible meat.</p>",

Until Ohsumi came on the scene in the 1990s, scientists thought that cells had a dumping ground for waste, but not the sophisticated recycling centre that Ohsumi discovered. Here she explains the day-to-day importance of autophagy in simply maintaining healthy cells in the body:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Every day we need to replace about 200-300g of protein in our bodies. Every two to three months, every protein in our body turns over. Because of autophagy, these 200-300g of proteins are made. We are eating proteins every day, about 70g, but that\u2019s not enough to take care of the requirement to make new proteins. Because of this machinery, we\u2019re able to rely on some of our own proteins, maybe the damaged proteins or the long-lived proteins, and they are recycled with this sophisticated machinery so that we can sustain and we survive. </p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-10-03T12:40:58.864Z\">at 1.40pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57f23f31e4b0ab0063087693\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-03T11:34:01.682Z\">12.34pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Ohsumi on winning the prize</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Ohsumi was in his lab when he received the call from Stockholm today. \u201cI was surprised,\u201d he told Adam Smith at Nobel Media in a telephone interview after the announcement.

His pioneering work gave the rest of the scientific community the tools they needed to explore autophagy, transforming it from niche area to one of the most popular in biology.

The work comes from the discovery that autophagy can get rid of proteins that can wreak havoc by clumping together in cells. Here\u2019s what he had to say:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I\u2019m very happy he\u2019s got this year\u2019s Nobel prize, it\u2019s very well deserved.

So when people worry about what should science funding be used for, it\u2019s very difficult to predict what\u2019s ultimately going to come up trumps, and by being restrictive, or penalising people who work on model systems that don\u2019t look like they\u2019re obviously related to human disease, you risk hampering the development of that field. You have to think of science in a holistic way, and understand that key discoveries that can be truly transformative can be made maybe more easily in these systems.

Autophagy can rapidly provide fuel for energy and building blocks for renewal of cellular components, and is therefore essential for the cellular response to starvation and other types of stress. After infection, autophagy can eliminate invading intracellular bacteria and viruses. Autophagy contributes to embryo development and cell differentiation. Cells also use autophagy to eliminate damaged proteins and organelles, a quality control mechanism that is critical for counteracting the negative consequences of ageing.</p> <p>Disrupted autophagy has been linked to Parkinson\u2019s disease, type 2 diabetes and other disorders that appear in the elderly. Mutations in autophagy genes can cause genetic disease. Disturbances in the autophagic machinery have also been linked to cancer.

They discovered a quality control system inside cells that spots when proteins have become dangerously misfolded. </p> <p>I\u2019m always hoping to see the prize go to Karl Deisseroth at Stanford and others for inventing optogenetics, a neat and powerful tool that has revolutionised areas of neuroscience. Scientists can use it to turn off individual neurons inside living organisms, and so work out what the brain cells do. But would the technique even qualify for the medicine prize? Or is it one for the chemistry prize, which increasingly rewards biomedical research?</p> <p>The analysts at Thomson Reuters wade through the <a href=\"http://wok.mimas.ac.uk/\">Web of Science</a> each year to compile a <a href=\"http://stateofinnovation.thomsonreuters.com/2016-citation-laureates\">list of contenders</a> for the Nobel prizes. This year they like the look of Gordon Freeman, Tasuku Honjo and Arlene Sharpe, whose work sheds light on the way cells are programmed to kill themselves off at the end of their useful lives. That knowledge has fed into the burgeoning field of cancer immunotherapy. Another tipped trio is James Allison, Jeffrey Bluestone and Craig Thompson who discovered how T cells, a major part of the immune system, are switched on. Another group that takes their fancy is Michael Hall, David Sabatini and Stuart Schreiber who discovered the target for the immune system-depressing drug rapamycin.</p> <p>As ever, we are in the dark until the committee makes its decision known.

  "<p>The chancellor, Philip Hammond, has sought to reassure business about the potential economic shock of Brexit, unveiling a new guarantee over EU funding and promising the referendum result should not result in people becoming poorer or less secure.</p> <p>Speaking to the Conservative party conference in Birmingham, Hammond also talked of what he called a pragmatic approach to austerity, reiterating that he would not seek a budget surplus by the end of this parliament in 2020.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/oct/03/conservative-conference-philip-hammond-confirms-osbornes-austerity-timetable-has-been-dropped-politics-live\">Tories ditch budget surplus pledge and announce \u00a33bn housebuilding plan - Politics live</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In a speech that took numerous potshots at Labour and even mocked Ed Balls for his current tenure on Strictly Come Dancing, Hammond focused on his plans for an economically smooth exit from the EU.</p> <p>The referendum on 23 June was a defining moment in a generation, Hammond said, adding: \u201cNo ifs, no buts, no second referendums. We are leaving the European Union.\u201d</p> <p>He continued: \u201cBut it is equally clear to me that the British people did not vote on 23 June to become poorer or less secure.\u201d</p> <p>Speaking in the wake of Theresa May\u2019s address to the conference, which <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/02/may-on-collision-course-with-backbenchers-seeking-soft-brexit\">appeared to hint that the government</a> was pursuing a \u201chard Brexit\u201d without full access to the EU\u2019s single market, Hammond noted that many businesses were unsure about what lay ahead.</p> <p>Given that \u201cbusiness hates uncertainty\u201d, Hammond said the Treasury would offer to guarantee all multi-year EU business funding agreed before Brexit, so long as they met value-for-money criteria.</p> <p>Speaking of the task ahead, Hammond said the UK sought to control its borders \u201cwhile protecting our economy, our jobs and our living standards\u201d. He continued: \u201cThe message may be simple, but the process will be complex. Successful negotiation with the EU27 will demand patience, experience, meticulous planning and steely resolution.\u201d</p> <p>In a section of the speech <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/03/philip-hammond-to-set-out-his-stall-for-balanced-budget-at-tory-conference\">heavily trailed the day before</a>, Hammond promised to pay down the deficit but to do so at a slower and more flexible pace.</p> <p>\u201cThe British people elected us on a promise to restore fiscal discipline,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd that is exactly what we are going to do. But we will do it in a pragmatic way that reflects the new circumstances we face.\u201d</p> <p>This would involve no longer having to generate a surplus by 2020, he said, although the longer-term notion of \u201cfiscal consolidation\u201d \u2013 balancing the budget \u2013 must be maintained, he said.</p> <p>In more party political sections, Hammond accused Jeremy Corbyn of taking Labour \u201cback to the bad old days of tax, spend and waste\u201d. </p> <p>While some have noted that the new fiscal loosening is reminiscent of Balls\u2019s views when he was shadow chancellor, Hammond mocked the former Labour MP and his Saturday evening dancing on BBC1.</p> <p>\u201cRemember Ed Balls?\u201d he asked, to laughter from the audience. \u201cI know you remember him from Saturday night \u2013 I\u2019m asking if you remember him from when he was shadow chancellor.</p> <p>\u201cYes, I saw Ed on Saturday too \u2013 and, not to sound too much like Craig Revel Horwood, I think his charleston is probably better than his economic analysis.\u201d<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Hammond ended with a combined appeal and prediction of a prosperous and confident economic future in the wake of EU departure.</p> <p>\u201cConference, the British people have made a bold decision,\u201d he said. \u201cOur party trusted them with the nation\u2019s future in a referendum, and now they trust our party to deliver on their decision. We will not let them down. But we are not going to turn our backs on the nations of Europe.\u201d</p> <p>He added: \u201cOur economic future must not be defined by Brexit alone. So as we tread the path to becoming an independent, sovereign country once again when future generations look back on our decision in 2016, they will see not the end of an era, but the beginning of a new age.\u201d</p>",

  "<p>For Jamie Oliver, a man used to politicians beating a path to his door, it must have been a rude awakening. Not only did Theresa May\u2019s new administration<strong> </strong>delete all the juiciest bits from the child obesity strategy<strong> </strong>he had championed, but when the celebrity chef protested, the door unceremoniously shut in his face. \u201cHer people have locked down all communications,\u201d <a href=\"http://www.radiotimes.com/news/2016-09-23/jamie-oliver-ive-nothing-nice-to-say-to-theresa-may\">Oliver plaintively told the Radio Times</a>.</p> <p>If it is any consolation, much of Westminster knows the feeling. There are, says one regular visitor, \u201csome seriously good people in there\u201d, but the new No 10 operation is rolling down the shutters.</p> <p>The days of kitchen suppers, old-school ties and being godparents to each other\u2019s children are over, with Downing Street briskly emptied of Cameron\u2019s \u201cchums\u201d. But May is building an inner circle in some ways equally closed to those who don\u2019t have the prime minister\u2019s trust. It is just that, in May\u2019s case, trust tends to be forged professionally, whereas, for Cameron, it often stemmed from friendships dating back to Eton or Oxford. That may have seemed normal to Cameron, having grown up in the kind of upper-middle-class English circle where everyone seemingly knows everyone, but it certainly isn\u2019t to May\u2019s people.</p> <p>The new tribe is more practical, more provincial \u2013 rooted in Birmingham and Bexley, not Notting Hill and Chipping Norton \u2013 and markedly less posh, bonding as beleaguered young party workers in the Tory wilderness years rather than at jolly country house weddings. (Even their salaries are said to have been capped at relatively frugal levels, and far from looking forward to OBEs, one insider jokes that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/aug/06/why-has-david-camerons-honours-list-caused-such-a-fuss\">the fuss over Cameron\u2019s resignation honours list</a> means they will probably be \u201clucky to get a cup of tea and a biscuit\u201d when they leave.) The overall vibe is distinctively more \u201cdoers\u201d than schmoozers. What is intriguing is how far their personal experiences overlap with May\u2019s political agenda of focusing on what she calls the \u201cjust managing\u201d \u2013 people who are working but not wealthy, who know how it feels to be on the outside of well-connected and comfortable elites, and are drawn to meritocratic ideas.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.totalpolitics.com/articles/news/pr-boss-katie-perrior-theresa-mays-top-spin-doctor\">Katie Perrior</a>, Downing Street\u2019s new director of communications, is a case in point. When she began working as May\u2019s press officer in the early 00s, Tory offices were still filled with faintly Sloaney \u201cgirls in pearls\u201d; with her south London accent and down-to-earth manner, Perrior stood out from the start. But though she may have orgnised raucous karaoke nights at party conferences, woe betide anyone who understimates her serious side. She served as a Tory councillor in suburban south London in her spare time, and nine years ago started up her own PR business with fellow Tory aide Jo Tanner. (Ignoring warnings from male rivals in a cut-throat industry that \u201cyou girls\u201d would flounder, they promptly bagged a contract for Boris Johnson\u2019s 2008 mayoral campaign, giving her a useful inside track to the now foreign secretary).</p> <p>Perrior\u2019s appointment is a sign of May\u2019s emphasis on proven practical skills but, crucially, also on loyalty, given that she is one of several longstanding allies who dropped everything at short notice in June to help with May\u2019s leadership campaign. But it is the very devotion of the prime minister\u2019s inner circle that makes some uneasy.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3967db7218e3049ad20aafde0479ab66068d9ad9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3967db7218e3049ad20aafde0479ab66068d9ad9/0_0_2123_1428/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Fiona Hill, joint chief of staff, seemingly a key confidante when May has to make a decision.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"673\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Fiona Hill, joint chief of staff, seemingly a key confidante when May has to make a decision.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Steve Back/Barcroft Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Power in the new regime is centralised in the hands of May\u2019s formidable joint chiefs of staff, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jul/15/may-appoints-former-advisers-as-joint-chiefs-of-staff\">Nick Timothy and Fiona Hill</a>, both famed for being, as one ex-colleague puts it, \u201chard as nails\u201d in ensuring her writ runs across Whitehall. Everything is funnelled through them and directions then come back down from the top, a change from Cameron\u2019s more open style, according to one former staffer: \u201cHe\u2019d ask us for ideas. He\u2019d say to the policy unit: \u2018This is the problem. What are we going to do?\u2019\u201d</p> <p>The pair are also overseeing a systematic review of policy decisions across government, methodically stripping everything back to the bones. \u201cWhat people in government are saying is that it\u2019s almost like a change of government, having to go back to basics and take people through stuff,\u201d says Jill Rutter, programme director at the thinktank <a href=\"http://www.instituteforgovernment.org.uk/\">Institute for Government</a>. \u201cEverything is being radically re-examined from first principles.\u201d</p> <p>It is the way May has always operated \u2013 Timothy and Hill were meticulous in spotting potential elephant traps at the Home Office, where they both worked for her, along with their deputy Jo Penn and deputy head of the policy unit Will Tanner \u2013 and arguably closer to the way things worked under Thatcher and Major. But there are ripples of alarm about the power it places in Timothy\u2019s hands particularly.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c707f38c8cf62b5fca9f8314b6dca2d125454c84\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c707f38c8cf62b5fca9f8314b6dca2d125454c84/0_167_1908_1144/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Joint chief of staff Nick Timothy, the primer mover in bringing back the 11-plus.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Joint chief of staff Nick Timothy, the primer mover in bringing back the 11-plus.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dominic Lipinski/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Nicknamed \u201cRasputin\u201d, the bearded steelworker\u2019s son has been identified as the prime mover in decisions from pausing the Hinkley Point power plant deal to bringing back the 11-plus. (A grammar school boy from Birmingham, he joined the Tories as a teenager after realising Labour opposed selection.) Crucially, he was also for leave in the EU referendum and, along with press secretary Lizzie Loudon \u2013 a former special adviser to Iain Duncan Smith, who joined No 10 from the leave campaign \u2013 brings an understanding of outers to discussions about Brexit.</p> <p>Hill, a serious-minded and ferociously hardworking ex-Sky News producer who grew up in Scotland, attracts less controversy, but her fingerprints were also evident in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/sep/19/theresa-may-resists-calls-uk-accept-syrian-refugees-aid\">May\u2019s speech earlier this month on modern slavery</a>; Hill encouraged May to take up the issue at the Home Office, and then produced her own report on the issue for thinktank Centre for Social Justice before coming into Downing Street.</p> <p>The word in Whitehall is that May won\u2019t make decisions in front of officials but, instead, says one source, \u201cgoes away for an hour with Nick and Fiona and \u2013 boing! \u2013 a decision is made. Which is exactly like Gordon Brown. He\u2019d go away, and we all assumed Ed [Balls] then told him what to do.\u201d That may not be strictly fair, but the relationship between the three of them is certainly critical to everything May does.</p> <p>The other change that has set tongues wagging is the diminished influence of the Treasury. Only one key member of George Osborne\u2019s camp, special adviser Neil O\u2019Brien, made the leap to the new Downing Street team and, unlike Osborne, the chancellor, Philip Hammond, isn\u2019t invited to the agenda-setting daily morning meeting in No 10. As Rutter, herself a former Downing Street civil servant, points out, that is arguably just a return to the historic norm after years of unusually equal partnership between Cameron and Osborne.</p> <p>But May\u2019s preference for smaller, tighter, more formal circles of decision-making perhaps also reflects her personality. Cameron was a social animal, happy mixing personal with professional, and liked to chew both over with Osborne at the beginning and end of his working day. Tony Blair was relaxed enough to take briefings as he was changing between engagements, hopping around in his underpants while his aides reeled off bullet points.</p> <p>May, however, is reserved to the point of shyness, and likes to keep things businesslike. The nearest thing she has to an old chum in cabinet is the work and pensions secretary Damian Green, an Oxford contemporary whose wife Alicia was her student supervision partner, but even he had to earn his cabinet job on merit. Education secretary Justine Greening and home secretary Amber Rudd are both also personal allies, but that didn\u2019t stop May putting Greening \u2013 a proud comprehensive schoolgirl, leading a Department for Education that has until now been highly resistant to selection \u2013 in a difficult position over grammar schools. There is a brisk professionalism to this regime that comes from the top.</p> <p>Crucially, it\u2019s also a team forged in adversity. Hill, Timothy, Perrior and several other No 10 advisers earned their spurs as junior staffers under Duncan Smith at a time of civil war within the party; John Godfrey, the new director of the policy unit, was an unsuccessful parliamentary candidate in Scotland in the early 90s, hardly the easiest time or place to be a Tory. While many of Cameron\u2019s staff came on board in sunnier times, this lot are battle-hardened and their interests tend towards the gritty.</p> <p>Timothy\u2019s passion is industrial strategy, Godfrey specialises in pensions, housing and longterm care \u2013 while one of few survivors from the Cameron era, special adviser Sheridan Westlake, who famously persuaded Eric Pickles to focus on the unglamorous issues that suburban voters cared about, such as <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2395167/Eric-Pickles-calls-spaces-stop-wheelie-bins-cluttering-streets.html\">the Daily Mail obsession with wheelie bins</a>.</p> <p>While the Cameroons\u2019 house journal was the comfortably establishment Times, anxious Mail readers \u2013 more suburban than urban, less financially comfortable, more anxious and insecure about the future \u2013 are now setting the agenda.</p> <p>May gets on well personally with the paper\u2019s editor-in-chief, Paul Dacre, and often chooses the Mail on Sunday\u2019s political editor, Simon Walters, for interviews; she took Liz Sanderson, a former Mail on Sunday features writer turned special adviser, into No 10 where her job is to promote the prime minister\u2019s agenda via features pages and magazines not read by political junkies. That won\u2019t, however, mean opening up her jealously guarded private life. Unlike Samantha Cameron, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jul/12/philip-may-theresa-may-quiet-husband-city-experience\">May\u2019s financier husband, Philip</a>, is still working full time, and will be a supportive but largely invisible background presence. There is little chance of cameras being allowed into their private Downing Street flat \u2013 as happened when <a href=\"http://www.standard.co.uk/news/politics/samantha-cameron-s-dream-kitchen-is-the-lure-at-flat-next-door-to-no-10-a3293781.html\">Angela Merkel and Michelle Obama were photographed on Cameron\u2019s mustard-yellow sofa</a> \u2013 and the new regime is generally warier of the media. While Cameron counted journalists among his personal friends, May keeps them firmly at arm\u2019s length and expects her intimates to do the same. Even the celebrity count at No 10 functions or dinners at Chequers is likely to be lower, with a beady eye on the cost to taxpayers.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"914ed61fe36ccc5810097814f5a54c79026bc7a3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/914ed61fe36ccc5810097814f5a54c79026bc7a3/0_228_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Michelle Obama was invited for tea with Samantha Cameron No 11 \u2013 not the sort of photo opportunity that Theresa May is likely to repeat.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Michelle Obama was invited for tea with Samantha Cameron at No 11 \u2013 not the sort of photo opportunity that Theresa May is likely to repeat.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: HO/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>And if the new Downing Street doesn\u2019t exactly sound like a barrel of laughs \u2013 well, as Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson said when backing May for leader, these are serious times for serious people. Or to put it another way, the party\u2019s over, and that big black door is once again slowly clanging shut.</p> <h2>What has happened to the Cameroons?</h2> <p>Every cloud has a silver lining, and for sacked male politicians, it is no longer having to shave for the cameras. But after a summer of rebelliously cultivating beards (yes, that means you, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2016/aug/17/stylewatch-michael-gove-beard\">Michael Gove</a> and Ed Vaizey) and licking their wounds, the defeated Cameroons are starting to get back down to business.</p> <p>For some, that simply means getting their side of the story out. First, and suspiciously fast, off the blocks was former No 10 spin doctor Craig Oliver, with a book accusing Theresa May of repeatedly finding so many excuses to get out of campaigning publicly for remain that in Downing Street she was known as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/25/brexit-books-david-cameron-theresa-may-party-split\">\u201csubmarine May\u201d</a>. Cameroon fingerprints are also evident in Sunday Times political editor Tim Shipman\u2019s All Out War, in which unnamed sources accuse \u201clily-livered\u201d May of having privately counselled against pushing for tougher curbs on EU immigration at the last minute, claims denied by her camp. Ken Clarke, who sparred memorably and sometimes publicly with May in cabinet, also has a potentially awkward memoir out shortly \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/20/david-cameron-perfect-political-memoir-more-indiscretion-less-spin\">while Cameron is still negotiating a deal for his</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9f876f311134f0ab9f5096e3c82905d10ffe4def\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9f876f311134f0ab9f5096e3c82905d10ffe4def/0_376_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ken Clarke, whose potentially awkward memoir will be out shortly\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ken Clarke, whose potentially awkward memoir will be out shortly.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Felix Clay for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But it is in parliament, not publishing, that the real battle looms. May\u2019s strategy of methodically reviewing almost every big decision made by Cameron, suggesting she plans a cleaner break with the past than expected, has galvanised his old set to defend what they see as his legacy.</p> <p>If nothing else, the referendum seems to have taught Cameroons of the importance of trying to build \u2013 or at least appear to build \u2013 popular grassroots movements behind them. Hence <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/09/15/george-osborne-launches-northern-powerhouse-thinktank-with-suppo/\">the thinktank George Osborne has just launched</a>, devoted to galvanising public support for his \u201cnorthern powerhouse\u201d, a project viewed with some scepticism in the May camp. (Westminster is watching with interest the relationship between Downing Street special adviser Neil O\u2019Brien \u2013 a former aide to Osborne who helped devise the initiative \u2013 and May\u2019s chief of staff Nick Timothy, also keen to grow the economy beyond London but said to have doubts about focusing everything on the northwest).</p> <p>The former chancellor\u2019s speech in Chicago last week, warning that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/23/george-osborne-brexit-won-majority-hard-brexit-did-not\">Britain voted for Brexit but not for a \u201chard Brexit\u201d</a> \u2013 in other words, that there\u2019s no mandate for leaving the single market \u2013 was another warning shot. Tory remainers are grimly determined not to let leavers sidle away too easily from campaign promises that Britain could have its cake and eat it, somehow enjoying the benefits of single-market membership while refusing freedom of movement.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"74d6343a7e3c38eb639d0599239442a4c5ad9183\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/74d6343a7e3c38eb639d0599239442a4c5ad9183/0_225_3500_2366/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Former education secretary Nicky Morgan will fight plans for new grammar schools\" width=\"1000\" height=\"676\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Former education secretary Nicky Morgan will fight plans for new grammar schools.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nick Ansell/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Former education secretaries Gove and Nicky Morgan will focus on <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/09/09/theresa-may-every-school-in-england-will-be-given-opportunity-to/\">fighting back against planned new grammar schools</a> in parliament and the media.

They may no longer wield power. But influence? The impeccably connected, frantically networking Cameroons were always good at that.</p>",
  "<p>To understand why, despite the recent funeral orations, liberalism is very much alive, you have to go back to the 1860s and the abolition of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/slavery\" title=\"\">slavery</a> in two key countries. To be precise, 1863, when \u2013 in one of the great coincidences of history \u2013 the proclamations of liberty for the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/jan/01/emancipation-proclamation-self-liberation\" title=\"\">American slaves</a> and the Russian serfs came just five weeks apart.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/15/brexit-liberalism-post-liberal-age\">Brexit was a revolt against liberalism. We\u2019ve entered a new political era | Martin Kettle</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Both liberations were great victories for anti-slavery campaigners, more than half a century after the first successes of the campaign against the slave trade. But they were also great disappointments for radicals. Because, in both cases, the slaves and the serfs were catapulted from bondage into poverty.</p> <p>In the US, slavery was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2015/dec/09/obama-abolition-slavery-anniversary-bigotry\" title=\"\">replaced by peonage and debt bondage</a>. In Russia, the land was valued at three and a half times its market value, and the impoverished serfs had to pay this to their former owners over a period of 49 years. It became clear that it wasn\u2019t enough to release the slaves \u2013 you had to release them from debt, monopoly and the economic tyranny that replaced it.</p> <p>By then, the basic tenets of free trade had been set out by economists, but it was liberalism that turned it into a political objective. Richard Cobden, Liberal MP for Rochdale \u2013 the man most responsible for the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/1846/jun/27/mainsection.fromthearchive\" title=\"\">repeal of the corn laws</a> in 1846, allowing the price of bread to fall \u2013 knew that if you just set slaves free, they could then potentially be bound just as firmly by controlling where they could buy what they needed, or by putting them in debt.</p> <p>So the original idea of free trade was not a simple licence to do whatever you wanted, if you were rich and powerful enough. It was designed as a means of liberation \u2013 so that the small could challenge the big, the poor could challenge the rich with the power of a new approach, an alternative provider, an imaginative, liberating shift. It was an antidote to the old pattern that employers could control not just what you were paid, but also what you paid for the things you needed to live.</p> <p>But recent decades have seen this central liberal economic doctrine become its own opposite \u2013 permission for the rich to ride roughshod over the poor, an apologia for monopoly and an extractive discipline that prevents the all-important challenge from below. It became instead a potential tool of enslavement.</p> <p>Why? Because of what happened in the US as a result of Friedrich Hayek\u2019s 1944 attack on scientific central planning and his <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Road_to_Serfdom\" title=\"\">manifesto for economic liberalism, The Road to Serfdom</a>, a hymn of praise to the idea that people needed to buy what they wanted, where they wanted \u2013 and that anything else was a recipe for tyranny.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"57b42e0e3c173fee40d134c730313a07ab706253\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/57b42e0e3c173fee40d134c730313a07ab706253/0_96_3664_2199/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Milton Friedman\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Milton Friedman\u2019s book Capitalism and Freedom marked the break between liberalism and neoliberalism.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: George Rose/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The book was praised by John Maynard Keynes and George Orwell, yet its message \u2013 and Hayek\u2019s alliance with the doyen of American liberalism, Henry Simons at Chicago University \u2013 led, in a few short decades, to something known as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/apr/15/neoliberalism-ideology-problem-george-monbiot\" title=\"\">neoliberalism</a>.</p> <p>Simons killed himself in 1946 but not before he and Hayek had raised the money, from a furniture manufacturer, to write a version of his book for a US audience. Two economists failed to finish it. It wasn\u2019t until 1962 that it was completed, by Simons\u2019s pupil Milton Friedman, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capitalism_and_Freedom\" title=\"\">who published it as Capitalism and Freedom</a>. This also marked the break between liberalism and neoliberalism, as I explain in my new book <a href=\"http://radix.org.uk/work/death-liberal-democracy/\" title=\"\">The Death of Liberal Democracy?</a>. Friedman argued that intellectual property was a kind of property, and must be defended as such, rather than \u2013 as it actually is \u2013 a temporary suspension of free trade to encourage innovation. That is why draft agreements such as the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP), which purport to be about free trade, are actually about defending investments and trademarks.</p> <p>Even more seriously, Friedman argued that monopoly didn\u2019t matter, and \u2013 if it did happen \u2013 it was the fault of the government for over-regulating.</p> <p>The first error led to the great heresy of neoliberalism, that corporations should be treated like human beings in legal terms. The second was a rejection of the most fundamental element in liberal economics, a defence against the over-concentration of market power. It was the very opposite of liberal free trade.</p> <p>It explains why the dead hand of neoliberal orthodoxy has ignored monopolies as a problem as they grow in power over our lives, as we fall into the tyrannical clutches of companies we are virtually forced to buy from, such as Visa, Google or Amazon, or some toxic future merger, say TescoVirginWalmart.</p> <p>So when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/15/brexit-liberalism-post-liberal-age\" title=\"\">Martin Kettle says that the era of post-liberalism is at hand</a>, he is not talking about political liberalism \u2013 which is suddenly a relevant critique of monopoly power \u2013 he is talking about a liberal heresy called neoliberalism, which means almost precisely the opposite. And when John McDonnell hails the same post-liberalism (which actually sounds more like pre-liberalism) <a href=\"http://blogs.spectator.co.uk/2016/09/full-speech-john-mcdonnell-labour-conference/\" title=\"\">in his Labour conference speech</a> \u2013 a vision of rival nations propping up their own steel industries (precisely the kind of waste that free trade was supposed to tackle), forced to pay more and more as the rivals pay more and more \u2013 he is missing the point.</p> <p>In fact, liberalism is alive and well and awaiting a champion for diverse economies. Because there are monopolies waiting to be broken up.</p>",

  "<p>When the justices of the US supreme court take their seats on Tuesday morning for the first set of oral arguments of their 2016-2017 session, many court-watchers will have their eyes more on the makeup of the court than the cases themselves. Since Justice Antonin Scalia\u2019s death in February, the nine-seat court has had only eight members, while Senate Republicans have refused to consider Barack Obama\u2019s pick, Judge Merrick Garland.</p> <p>Having only eight members of the court means that, theoretically, any and every case could result in a tie between the court\u2019s four remaining conservative members and the liberals, even in those cases expected to resolve disparities in lower courts\u2019 rulings. </p> <p>Renee Cramer, a professor of law, politics and society at Drake University, cautioned that the effects of the eight-member court on the law \u2013 at least at the beginning of this term \u2013 are likely to be minimal. \u201cThe political implications are probably greater than the judicial implications,\u201d she said.</p> <p>\u201cThe four-four split wasn\u2019t changing decisions incredibly\u201d in the wake of Scalia\u2019s death, she explained. \u201cBut it was maybe changing the way that those decisions were communicated.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2016/jun/24/us-supreme-court-split-decision-barack-obama-immigration\">Split happens: deadlocks rarely occur in the supreme court. But why?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cThey appear to be appealing to a desire not to be seen as overreaching,\u201d she added, issuing rulings \u201cmore narrowly tailored to the specific instances\u201d.</p> <p>Of the 19 cases currently scheduled for oral arguments, here are six that could have the broadest implications.</p> <h2>Buck v Davis</h2> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2016/jun/06/supreme-court-appeal-texas-death-row-inmates\">Duane Buck</a> shot and killed his ex-girlfriend and her friend in Texas in 1995 and was convicted; the case before the court challenges his death penalty sentence. During the penalty phase of his trial, Buck\u2019s defense attorney \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.dallasnews.com/news/crime/2016/08/13/texas-lawyer-never-won-capital-murder-case-calls-quits-defending-worst-clients\">called</a> one of the worst defense lawyers in capital cases in the country \u2013 brought to the stand an expert witness intended to demonstrate to the jury that Buck was not a continuing threat to the community, a key standard for imposing the death penalty. Instead, the defense introduced the testimony of Dr Walter Quijano, who wrote that, statistically speaking, Buck was more likely to commit crimes in the future because he is black. </p> <p>He was sentenced to death, and appealed on the grounds that his counsel had been ineffective, though not because his lawyer introduced Quijano\u2019s testimony.</p> <p>The state of Texas later admitted before the supreme court that Quijano\u2019s testimony was prejudicial. But the state objected to the challenge of Buck\u2019s death sentence because his own lawyer introduced the evidence, and because prosecutors do not believe that the circumstances of Buck\u2019s sentencing rise to the level of extraordinary circumstances.</p> <p>The court may decide the case on either question.</p> <h2>Pe\u00f1a-Rodriguez v Colorado</h2> <p>Miguel Angel Pe\u00f1a-Rodriguez was convicted on three misdemeanor counts of sexually harassing two teenage girls. But after the trial ended, it emerged that one of the jurors \u2013 a former police officer \u2013 had made several racist comments about Mexicans during deliberations. Among other things, he told his fellow jurors that Mexican men were more inclined to commit sexual offenses against women than white Americans.</p> <p>Pe\u00f1a-Rodriguez challenged his conviction, arguing that he has a right to an impartial jury under the sixth amendment. But he\u2019s been stymied by laws that prohibit jurors from talking about what happens during deliberations. </p> <p>The court is expected to hear arguments on 11 October that Pe\u00f1a-Rodriguez\u2019s right to a jury free of racial prejudice ought to trump laws that prohibit jurors from testifying about their own lack of impartiality.</p> <h2>Manuel v City of Joliet</h2> <p>Elijah Manuel attempted to sue the city of Joliet, Illinois, in federal court after he was arrested for possession of ecstasy based on evidence falsified by the police and was held for nearly two months. He claimed the city had violated his constitutional right against illegal search and seizure under the fourth amendment.</p> <p>The federal judge who heard his case dismissed it: in the federal courts in the district that covers the state of Illinois, lawsuits against the authorities for false arrest or false imprisonment have to be heard in state courts, where plaintiffs have more difficulty winning. (In most other federal districts, these suits can be heard in federal court first.)</p> <p>Manuel appealed, and the appeals court judges ruled again that he should have filed in state court and added that he should have filed within two years of his arrest, instead of within two years of his release \u2013 a standard which would make it even more difficult to sue.</p> <p>If the supreme court sides with Manuel, it would become easier for everyone in Illinois \u2013 including in the city of Chicago, which faces a variety of allegations of police misconduct \u2013 to sue for relief in federal court.</p> <h2>Samsung v Apple</h2> <p>In what may be the final chapter of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2012/aug/28/apple-samsung-patent-infringement-payout\">expensive</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/mar/31/apple-sues-samsung-for-2bn\">long-running</a> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/aug/06/apple-samsung-drop-patent-lawsuits-outside-usa\">international</a> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2012/aug/22/apple-samsung-patent-dispute\">patent war</a> between the two smartphone behemoths, Samsung is asking the supreme court to decide the appropriate amount of damages for an alleged violation of Apple\u2019s design patents.

In the penalty phase, based on an 1886 law, Apple was awarded $1.2bn \u2013 the entirety of Samsung\u2019s profits on the allegedly infringing phones \u2013 though the award was reduced to $584m on appeal.<br></p> <p>Samsung argues the majority of a smartphone\u2019s value is in its utility, not in its design (in this case, its bevelled corners and black back side), and thus awarding all its profits on the sales of the phones to Apple based on a design infringement on only three components is a misreading of the law. The court is being asked to decided whether the violation of a design patent on a complex product should trigger an award for the entire value of the product.</p> <h2>Bank of America v City of Miami and Wells Fargo v City of Miami</h2> <p>The city of Miami attempted to sue Bank of America, Wells Fargo and Citigroup (which did not pursue the supreme court appeal) for violations of the Fair Housing Act. </p> <p>The city claims the lenders drove a wave of foreclosures that cost the city, by engaging in predatory lending to minority borrowers and offering worse refinancing rates to minorities. </p> <p>The banks successfully argued in federal district trial court that the city could not sue because it was not immediately harmed by the banks\u2019 actions, but the city won on appeal. The supreme court will hear arguments on 8 November (Election Day) to decide whether a city can serve as a valid plaintiff in a discriminatory lending case. </p> <h2>Lynch v Morales-Santana</h2> <p>On 9 November \u2013 immediately after the presidential election \u2013 the court will hear arguments about whether the laws that govern citizenship discriminate based on the gender of the parent.</p> <p>At issue is the citizenship of Luis Morales-Santana, who was born in the Dominican Republic to a father born in the US and a mother who was a non-US citizen. Under the laws at the time of his birth (prior to 1986), children born to unmarried parents outside the US would get citizenship if their mothers had lived in the US for a year. But they would not get citizenship via fathers born in the US unless the father had lived there for 10years, including and five years after the age of 14. (After 1986, the standard became five years for fathers, two after the age of 14.) Morales-Santana\u2019s father was 20 days shy of the limit when he moved to the Dominican Republica, and the government is attempting to deport Morales-Santana.</p> <p>The court has been asked to decide whether the citizenship laws are a violation of the fifth amendment\u2019s equal protection clauses because they differ based on gender. It\u2019s also being asked to decide whether the appeals court had the right to grant Morales-Santana citizenship at all. </p>",

Despite their enthusiam for a new political heroine, they were just as concerned about how she will realise her (and their) ambitions.</p> <p>The Telegraph, while moved by May\u2019s \u201cstirring and patriotic speech\u201d wondered how she will rise to \u201cthe political challenge that lies ahead.\u201d It said:</p> <blockquote> <p>\u201cMrs May said she wanted the \u2018right deal\u2019 for Britain. But there are fundamental differences of opinion over what that constitutes, not just in parliament but in her own party...</p> <p>The deep divisions exposed by the referendum are reflected among Conservatives just as they are in the country at large. </p> <p>Mrs May\u2019s task is to chart a course between the two extremes and find a way through that both holds her party together and benefits the country, while retaining a good relationship with Europe. It is a monumental task that has only just begun.\u201d</p> </blockquote> <p>The Times thought May \u201cshort on specifics\u201d, <a href=\"http://www.thetimes.co.uk/edition/comment/no-soft-option-n97ztr02w\">demonstrating \u201cthe risk at the heart of negotiations for Brexit\u201d.</a> It urged the prime minister to \u201cacknowledge that many of the regulations that currently apply as a result of membership are helpful for commerce\u201d and EU membership \u201cconfers economic benefits.\u201d</p> <p>It was unimpressed with her \u201cso-called Great Repeal Act\u201d, arguing that \u201cit is simply not correct for Mrs May to have claimed that this legislation will make Britain a \u2018sovereign and independent country\u2019 again.\u201d</p> <p>The paper also said: \u201cThe idea that there are no costs at all in Brexit and that the benefits of membership may be retained is... false and irresponsible.\u201d</p> <p>The Guardian was, if anything, slightly softer on the prime minister. It noted that May has still failed to detail what Brexit means, but argued that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/02/the-guardian-view-on-the-tories-and-brexit-may-still-does-not-know-her-goal\">\u201cshe did enough to be going on with.\u201d</a></p> <p>While accepting that \u201cthis is still a largely symbolic stage of the process\u201d, the paper thought it \u201ca very dispiriting spectacle to anyone who wants the terms of Britain\u2019s departure from the EU to contain some recognition that 48% of the electorate rejected the proposition altogether.\u201d </p> <p>The Independent believed May\u2019s speech indicated <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/voices/editorials/theresa-may-s-timetable-for-article-50-won-t-allay-brexit-concerns-a7341636.html\">\u201cshe may be preparing for a hard Brexit\u201d</a> and, if so, \u201cjitters will run through the Europhile wing of the Conservative party quicker than you can say Liam Fox.\u201d</p> <p>It said: \u201cIt is incumbent on the prime minister therefore to provide a clearer sense of what Brexit will look like... Only then can the British people work out whether the government is exceeding the mandate it was given.\u201d</p> <p>The Financial Times was encouraged by May having <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/9968043e-88c3-11e6-8aa5-f79f5696c731\">\u201cprovided much-needed clarity.\u201d </a>Even so, her \u201cspeech still leaves plenty of options open\u201d which \u201cmay not please business, which has been desperate for [Brexit] details\u201d.</p> <p>But the FT is clearly worried: \u201cSignificant questions... remain about the economic impact... Her speech was predictably heavy on patriotic emotion and light on strategy.\u201d</p> <p>The Mail wasn\u2019t so concerned about that, praising May for giving \u201cBritain a date with destiny\u201d and \u201claying out an inspiring vision of Britain\u2019s future after we become an independent sovereign country once more.\u201d</p> <p>It said: \u201cThere is to be no backsliding, no quibbling and no shabby \u2018Brexit-lite\u2019 sellout.\u201d But it also realise that May \u201cshould be under no illusion about the vast scale of the task ahead\u201d, not least from \u201cmany embittered Remainers who still want to subvert the will of the people.\u201d The Mail continued:</p> <blockquote> <p>\u201cThese contemptible wreckers are in total denial about the referendum result. They claim to be standing up for democracy but in fact they are flouting it.\u201d</p> </blockquote> <p>The Sun referred to remainers as \u201cremoaners\u201d and, while conceding that We should \u201cthe road ahead will be tough\u201d believed \u201cthe PM has shown us she\u2019s ready to fight and she believes she can win.\u201d It concluded:</p> <blockquote> <p>\u201cShe won\u2019t compromise on restoring British sovereignty, cutting immigration or our ability to forge new trade deals \u2014 exactly as the Sun demanded.</p> <p>A confident, capable female Prime Minister we can be proud of on the world stage. Remind you of anyone?\u201d</p> </blockquote> <p>The Express pointed to the CBI\u2019s claim that \u2018British business can expect a Brexit \u2018surge\u2019\u201d and said \u201cthe outlook for this country is better than it has been for years.\u201d</p> <p>And the Mirror? It lashed into May as <a href=\"http://www.mirror.co.uk/incoming/voice-mirror-theresa-no-plan-8966613\">\u201can accidental prime minister unable to control her own destiny\u201d</a> who is being \u201cbullied by ideological Tories.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMrs May,\u201d it said, \u201crisks becoming a prisoner of the Tory ideologues\u201d, which represents \u201ca frightening threat to our prosperity and security.\u201d</p>",

In fact, I rather think that literary dogs, for all the instances of good and faithful service, are more likely to have malign than benign <a href=\"http://www.metaphordogs.org/\">symbolic connotations</a>. But the dog of Helen Farish\u2019s new collection <a href=\"http://www.bloodaxebooks.com/ecs/product/the-dog-of-memory-1126\">The Dog of Memory</a> is no rough cynic but a bringer of gifts and delight. In a collection much concerned with memory as the retrieval of sense impressions, the sheepdog in this poem feels like a protective if excitable <em>genius loci</em>.<br></p> <p> The first question a reader might ask concerns the subject of the demonstrative pronoun in \u201cMemory rounds this up\u201d \u2026 Does \u201cthis\u201d imply this poem or the work in general? I think that, by sourcing the collection\u2019s title in The dog itself, Farish indicates that this poem has wider significance and that it embraces a general imaginative direction.</p> <p> At the same time, there\u2019s an immediacy to the thought, \u201cMemory rounds this up, breathless\u201d, an invigorating sense of the poem in real time discovering its raw material. The rush to get everything down gains explicitness in the final stanza, but it begins here, with the implication that the poem itself has been retrieved alive at this very moment by an eager and \u201cbreathless\u201d dog. </p> <p> Farish inhabits a variety of locations in her work, but frequently connects poetry and the finding of her own language with Cumbria (known in her childhood as \u201cCumberland\u201d, as another poem explains). She would echo Wordsworth, perhaps, in saying: \u201c<a href=\"http://www.bartleby.com/145/ww287.html\">Fair seed-time had my soul.</a>\u201d However, the poetry is not backwards-facing. The presence of the \u201cbedroom window\u201d, for example, seems unaffected by the passage of time. It may belong to an earlier time, or to the present, but the memory-work of such poetry includes making everything accessible to the present tense.</p> <p>The dog metaphor provides a strong, well-founded framing device, allowing the poem to resist sensory overload and focus on the sense of smell. The different odours the memory-dog drops at the speaker\u2019s feet are a potent, nostril-tingling mix. \u201cWool in the rain\u201d connects us with the jostle of warm sheep in pasture, as well as that inimitable smell of damp jersey. The ensuing reference to the aunt and her cigarette adds a time signal: now we\u2019re more definitely transported to the speaker\u2019s past. A colloquialism, \u201con the hoof\u201d, amusingly puts the animal into the human, and hints at social context: there might be something rushed and perhaps guilty about this woman\u2019s al fresco \u201csmoke\u201d. It\u2019s not a judgment made by the speaker, though, as she catches the lingering whiff of adult freedom. </p> <p> \u201cGorse also\u201d begins the third stanza, with a wonderfully rasping, scratchy sound. I\u2019ve always thought of flowering gorse as having a coconut sort of smell, but we\u2019re at liberty to make our own associations. There\u2019s a brilliant, shorthand image of growth in the phrase \u201cfirs making green\u201d. It reminded me of the modest little Christmas tree I planted a few years back, now aspiring to the splendid height of the adult sitka spruce, and ready to strike stars and lightning from the electricity supply lines. </p> <p> The firs\u2019 accumulation of foliage, first seen in terms of colour, is translated to the primary dog-sense through the parenthesis: \u201cgorse also, firs making green,/(and what it all means, /that too has a smell)\u201d. Are we on the cusp of the metaphysical? Or does the finding and making of ultimate meaning (\u201cwhat it all means\u201d ) have a smell, a pungency of libraries or new paper, or some more personal aroma? Is there a pheromone associated particularly with the intellectual workout? Or with making poems? The dog, of course, would know.</p> <p>Solemn poems have been written about being a poet and/or writing poetry, and, of course, jokey ones, often <a href=\"https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems-and-poets/poems/detail/49051\">advising against it</a>. This one captures the sheer rush of elation it can be. The good dog memory is delighted with itself, and the recipient of its gifts (to raid the Wordsworth quote-kitty again) is \u201csurprised by joy\u201d. Only that neat conclusive pun announcing the need to \u201cpen it in quick,\u201d suggests that a harsher hand must intervene in fixing memory as art. </p> <p><em>\u2022 </em>The dog itself is taken from <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/dog-of-memory.html\">The Dog of Memory by Helen Farish</a>, published by Bloodaxe Books, 2016.</p>",

Xbox One S is the console people actually wanted</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8225b52f68e44643cca80e5a13df9fa5590d877d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8225b52f68e44643cca80e5a13df9fa5590d877d/0_0_2100_1260/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The smaller Xbox One S and new wireless controller\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The smaller Xbox One S and new wireless controller.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Microsoft</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Microsoft got off to the worst possible start in this generation. Its May 2013 Xbox One launch event was a hubristic shambles, where the company chose to concentrate on its Live TV offerings rather than games \u2013 and then it revealed a console that looked like a school VCR circa 1983. After launch, there were lacklustre exclusives and, crucially, the framerate and resolution performances of multi-platform games weren\u2019t holding up to PS4.</p> <p>But revealed at E3 this summer, Xbox One S is a sleeker, smaller chassis in a trendy \u201crobot white\u201d colour that completely differentiates it from the original machine. Improvements to the design and capabilities of the package (including adding an IR blaster for universal remote control capabilities and bluetooth support for the joypad), subtly increased its appeal. You can also put it on its side. Some people love doing that.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <h2>2. The price is now right for two key markets</h2> <p>You can buy the 500GB Xbox One S for \u00a3250, complete with a bundled game. This is tipping the console out of the enthusiast market, into the family purchase sector \u2013 at least for some households. This could mean that we\u2019ll start to see more parents upgrading their Xbox 360s in the coming months. Furthermore, at this point we may also be seeing \u201chardcore\u201d gamers who originally opted for PS4 two years ago, now purchasing an Xbox One S as a second console to hoover up legacy platform exclusives like the Forza and Halo titles \u2013 and prepare for forthcoming Xbox One-only titles. More of that later.</p> <h2>3. Xbox has courted the young fans with the right games</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"90fc3afea47996197011b0efe0a3557ec9f37357\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/90fc3afea47996197011b0efe0a3557ec9f37357/0_43_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A moment from the 2015 Call of Duty European Championships final.

Until this year, Xbox sponsored the game\u2019s eSports events, attracting a huge audience of fans, pro gamers and YouTubers to the console</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rob Stothard/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Microsoft has done some canny marketing deals over the past few years, tying up exclusive downloadable and in-game content with the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/sep/30/fifa-17-review-ea-sports-story-mode\">Fifa</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/jun/23/call-of-duty-infinite-warfare-were-going-for-a-classic-feel\">Call of Duty</a> titles, both hugely popular with the teen demographic. Specifically, the exclusive Ultimate Team Legends cards, and the Microsoft sponsorship of the Call of Duty (CoD) eSports finals have ensured that a lot of young gamers are playing those huge titles on Xbox. Furthermore, the deals have meant that influential pro-gamers, YouTubers and Twitch streamers are favouring Xbox for their Fifa and CoD content. </p> <p>Basically, Microsoft has targeted titles that the next generation of \u2018hardcore\u2019 gamers are playing with their friends \u2013 and that approach appears to be bearing fruit. Little wonder Sony is now moving into those markets, <a href=\"http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2015-08-14-after-five-years-of-xbox-exclusivity-call-of-duty-switches-to-playstation\">grabbing the Call of Duty (CoD) exclusivity package</a> this year. And it\u2019s no coincidence that one of the titles bundled with <a href=\"http://www.techradar.com/news/gaming/consoles/cheapest-ever-ps4-deals-get-the-ps4-with-fifa-17-for-just-149-1329524\">the recent \u00a3149 flash sale for PS4</a> was Fifa 17.<br></p> <h2>4. That whole 4K thing</h2> <p>Xbox One S was revealed with a strong message at this year\u2019s E3: it will run 4K video, it will process HDR visual effects and it\u2019ll play 4K UHD Blu-ray discs. With prices of 4K televisions plummeting and sales growing, it was a smart move to immediately align this updated console with the improved resolution technology. The news that PlayStation 4 Pro won\u2019t play 4K Blu-ray discs has been greeted with surprise and derision by audio-visual enthusiasts, and that message can filter down to mainstream consumers who may like the idea of, say, owning all the new Star Wars films on UHD. Xbox One S also upscales current titles to 4K compatibility, adding an extra impetus. </p> <h2>5. The exclusives are coming</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"124ae77300cb258460af4869dcbc992b450c1330\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/124ae77300cb258460af4869dcbc992b450c1330/121_0_1799_1080/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Gears of War 4: likely to be popular with fans of cover-based alien carnage\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Gears of War 4: likely to be popular with fans of cover-based alien carnage</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Microsoft</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Of course, PlayStation 4 has its own catalogue of exciting exclusives, but things are definitely hotting up for Xbox One. Forza Horizon 3 is already one of the great racing games of this generation, and there are big returning franchises to come in the shape of Gears of War 4, Halo 6, Dead Rising 4, State of Decay 2 and Crackdown 3 that won\u2019t be on PlayStation (of course they\u2019ll all be on PC too, but we\u2019re talking about the console market here). Newcomers like monster hunting adventure Scalebound, online pirate romp Sea of Thieves and idiosyncratic platformer Cuphead also look very interesting. As performance issues stabilise, the success of any console in a generation begins to rely much more heavily on the quality of the software itself. Microsoft is definitely doing its best to prepare for that stage of the war.</p>",
  "<p>New figures show in June that nearly a quarter of a million children and young people were in contact with mental health services for problems such as anxiety, depression and eating disorders. <br></p> <p>The NHS data highlights the scale of the growing crisis in young people\u2019s mental health. But what help is there for those who need it? Research shows <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/may/28/nhs-turning-away-children-referred-for-mental-health-help\">28% of children referred for support in England</a> \u2013 including some who had attempted suicide \u2013 received no help in 2015.</p> <p>We asked for your experiences of children\u2019s mental health services in England, receiving responses from parents, teachers and young people themselves. Here are some excerpts from the comments we received, condensed and edited for clarity.</p> <h2>Beth Ackers, 18, Merseyside</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"e63d2f5676dcb561e6b2a0e15f4a9949d2fa2277\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e63d2f5676dcb561e6b2a0e15f4a9949d2fa2277/0_0_280_280/280.png\" alt=\"Beth Ackers\" width=\"280\" height=\"280\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>I went to the doctor last year because I was feeling depressed and anxious. I was nervous about going to see my GP as I wasn\u2019t sure what was wrong with me. My mum came with me and I think she did most, if not all, of the talking. I was just too emotional and worked-up to speak properly.</p> <p>I was immediately referred to child and adolescent medical health services [CAMHS] and an assessment appointment was set up. After this, I was told I would only have to wait six weeks, but when I hadn\u2019t heard anything by 12 weeks I was told that they would need to do the initial assessment again. I was then referred to cognitive behavioural therapy and given six sessions. However, when I got to the end of these sessions they said that I actually needed different treatment. The person who saw me felt that my issues were more ingrained and talking to a counsellor or therapist might be more appropriate. I was told this at the beginning of June and still haven\u2019t got an appointment to talk with someone. Since then, I\u2019ve turned 18 and am not sure how this will affect my treatment. The whole experience has made me feel quite isolated and abandoned. It took a lot to talk about how I was feeling, and now I feel like I am being ignored. I also found the service quite disorganised, and doing the assessment again was stressful. I cannot afford to get private counselling and am just hoping that I was will be offered someone to talk to at my university when I start soon. <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <h2>Azia, 17, West Yorkshire <br></h2> <p>I went to see my GP in 2014 about anxiety and depression. I had been feeling hopeless and helpless, tearful, with no motivation or interest in doing anything. I was not getting any enjoyment out of life and had suicidal thoughts. From around the age of 13, I also experienced anxiety. The physical symptoms were headaches, soreness in my limbs, bloatedness (and with that increased trips to the toilet), sweats and shivers, loss of libido and increased sleeping.</p> <p>My doctor recommended that I get help from a local mental health charity called <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.themarketplaceleeds.org.uk/\">The Market Place</a> before considering children\u2019s and adolescent\u2019s mental health services. The counselling was not helpful, so I went back to my GP who referred me to CAMHS.</p> <p>My assessment happened within three to five months and I was given a case manager and began family therapy soon after. We soon discovered that it wasn\u2019t the right therapy for me and so I began mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) a month later.</p> <p>I am currently undergoing cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), which I am finding very helpful. The waiting period for this therapy was over six months however, which was very frustrating. Having said that, I could still contact my case manager if I needed to, and she was always very helpful.</p> <p>Overall I have had few problems with CAMHS and all the medical professionals I have come into contact with are excellent. They are superb listeners and have always asked me what I felt was best for me as well as giving their professional opinion. Many people slate CAMHS without appreciating the good they do and the lack of control they have over certain areas, such as waiting periods. <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>The waiting period I endured for CBT was rather long and it allowed my problems to get worse. However I am reluctant to criticise CAMHS for this because if they were given adequate funding from the government this wouldn\u2019t be a problem. </p> <h2>Rose Grace, 24, Manchester<br></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"9788503302c17cf49d56af32c61f2e134ec8b43e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9788503302c17cf49d56af32c61f2e134ec8b43e/0_0_280_280/280.png\" alt=\"Rose Grace\" width=\"280\" height=\"280\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>I was 14 when I was diagnosed with anorexia. Having an eating disorder was one of the worst experiences of my life, a situation made worse by children\u2019s mental health services. Firstly, the therapist I was assigned to made me feel uncomfortable; it felt like he was blaming my parents for my situation and I didn\u2019t feel I was being listened to. I ended up working out for myself what was causing my eating disorder.<br></p> <p>Eventually, my condition got worse and I was admitted to hospital as an inpatient. However, I wasn\u2019t admitted as a patient in a specialist unit for eating disorders and the staff didn\u2019t seem to have any experience treating people with conditions such as my own. They made me feel I had brought this all on myself. A few weeks later I left hospital and despite being physically better, I was psychologically worse. It was only because of my parents that my condition improved over the next few years. They spoke to another therapist who helped them understand how to help me. The biggest step forward was talking about my anorexia differently and viewing it as a negative voice separate from me. My parents then would say to me, \u201cI know that this is not you, it\u2019s your anorexia\u201d and I would realise they were right. Being able to visualise it that way helped me to beat it.</p> <h2>Leo Winkley, 45, headteacher, York<br></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"29f89dbf05c7fdee7c5df4b4a0a27730bef254b9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/29f89dbf05c7fdee7c5df4b4a0a27730bef254b9/0_0_280_280/280.png\" alt=\"Leo Winkley\" width=\"280\" height=\"280\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>This is a really important issue for schools \u2013 the simple fact is that we are having to plug the gaps in provision and cover the ridiculous waiting times for children to be seen in a massively overstretched and under-resourced CAMHS. Solutions that we have put in place include training teachers in mental health first aid, employing a team of counsellors for drop-in sessions and developing a more proactive mental health and wellbeing course within our personal, social, health and economic programme. We are very lucky to have the resources to do this. There needs to be investment to allow schools to equip teachers better; whether we like it or not, teachers will be in the frontline on the critical issue of children\u2019s mental health.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Whether we like it or not, teachers will be in the frontline on the critical issue of children\u2019s mental health.</p> <footer> <cite>Leon Winkley</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>There are times when a school really needs to refer a child on to experts. This is where the real problems lie \u2013 the lengthy delays. With an under-resourced CAMHS, the management response seems to be to make the referral thresholds higher and higher. In this situation, the school can only put its own support, monitoring and reporting measures in place and put all reasonable pressure on the local CAMHS provider. It\u2019s very important that pastoral care in a school doesn\u2019t desensitise the public to these issues and only deals with the most acute or chronic cases. Early and sensitive intervention can make a big difference.</p> <h2>Anonymous, 17, London<br></h2> <p>Initially, I went to the doctor for my low and high moods, including hallucinations, delusions and suicidal thoughts. Going to the GP was daunting, but I found the doctor empathetic and professional. She called CAMHs and the reply was instant. I was contacted the next day and asked to come in the day after. Everything happened swiftly. I met a family therapist for my first session in which I gave information about my symptoms and what had happened to me. My next session was with a psychiatrist whom I then started to meet weekly, even though I was reluctant to talk. My psychiatrist was very helpful and compassionate, and seemed to care about me as a client. I regularly attended sessions in which we would discuss techniques and strategies, go through my thought processes in trying circumstances and discuss what was important to me. I was made to feel comfortable and secure, and never judged. I was very satisfied with how things were going. However, I do understand that friends who have gone through CAMHS have not been as lucky. I was told in all of my sessions where I could go for help, who I could talk to and I was given all the support I needed.</p> <p>I am still attending my fortnightly sessions. I have not yet received any medication, as they did want to put me on anti-depressants. However, they were worried about the potential increase of suicidal thoughts. They also wanted to put me on anti-psychotic medication, but, were reluctant because of my age. I have not received a diagnosis, but they are still investigating.</p> <h2>Anonymous, 51, Buckinghamshire</h2> <p>My children have had ongoing mental health issues and have received support from our local CAMHS over the years. However, local services have deteriorated significantly over the past five years.</p> <p>My youngest child has had repeated referrals to CAMHS over the last two years by their school and GP for their deteriorating mental health difficulties. On every occasion we were told they didn\u2019t meet the threshold for therapeutic help even though they were self-harming, threatening to kill themselves and having increasingly dangerous angry outbursts requiring police interventions.</p> <p>In desperation, I insisted that my youngest be referred to a specialist hospital team for a second opinion. Their diagnosis was early bipolar syndrome. They prescribed medication to help and my child was referred back to local CAMHS for ongoing care.</p> <p>Sadly, my child made another attempt on her life which required hospitalisation as an inpatient. After a seven-day wait at home, the only bed available was more than 300 miles away from our home. My child has been resident there for more than two months and no bed closer to home has become available.</p> <p>Having my child sent so far away has left me feeling helpless and unable to support her as much as I would like. Communication has been very difficult both with my child and the hospital staff and I have found myself constantly having to chase for information and to reassure my child. Visiting has been restricted to weekends; it\u2019s a five-hour drive from where we live.</p> <p>Initially we were told the mental heath services would continue to seek out a bed closer to home but that has not materialised. My child was initially relieved to have had a bed located but upset that it was so far away. They miss their home comforts, our pets and family. These things have, I feel, added to everyone\u2019s distress.</p> <p>We are still waiting for local CAMHS to share their support plan for when my child returns home. Our local CAMHS does not offer family therapy such as art therapy, owing to cuts. </p> <h2>James Downs, 27, Cardiff<br></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"371cf051252cd796a14bee995aad8672f8539dfa\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/371cf051252cd796a14bee995aad8672f8539dfa/0_0_280_280/280.png\" alt=\"James Downs\" width=\"280\" height=\"280\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>I was a high-achieving young boy and at 14 I developed obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) and anxiety about my appearance. It got to the point that it would take me ages to get ready and I kept skipping school without telling anyone why. After a year of doing this, I told my parents and the school the reasons behind my truancy and was eventually referred to children\u2019s mental health services. I was seen quickly but the quality of treatment wasn\u2019t very good. I felt like they wanted to treat me for OCD without talking about any deeper issues going on. I was offered help but soon my OCD changed into an eating disorder and I became anorexic. I didn\u2019t feel they were working with me to improve my health, but that they felt I was badly behaved. The whole focus was just on, \u201cYou must gain weight\u201d rather than them asking, \u201cWhat\u2019s going on to make you feel this way?\u201d Eventually I gained weight and was given a lot of medication (anti-depressants etc) which I wasn\u2019t happy with. I was offered care in my community and sent home, with a team around me to help. I gained weight but developed bulimia and no one seemed to care about this, so I just stopped talking to people about it. I am still working through my issues with food and cannot help but feel that my life might have been different if these issues had been properly dealt with when I was younger.</p> <p>I know there are more specialist services in place for treating eating disorders now, but I also know there are cuts to CAMHs and what\u2019s on offer is quite patchy. This makes me worry for other young people as I don\u2019t want them to go through what I did.</p> <h2>Tracey Lawrence, 31, assistant head, Leicestershire</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"c36e664f371ae8530fb1b2189ea92e7f818a9dea\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c36e664f371ae8530fb1b2189ea92e7f818a9dea/0_0_280_280/280.png\" alt=\"Tracey Lawrence\" width=\"280\" height=\"280\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Mental health is everybody\u2019s business. The government needs to invest more so that we, as classroom teachers, receive proper training to deal with these issues and have the support in place when exploring the best way to move forward with a child. There\u2019s a fear of delving into mental health because of a lack of knowledge \u2013 that\u2019s why teachers need a clear structure for support. It\u2019s an issue the government says it cares about, but at the moment it isn\u2019t doing very much.</p> <p>The waiting time for CAMHS is not a hidden issue. You hear report after report about the impossibility of having a child referred and the lack of help when you get there. There is pressure for teachers to plug the hole left by a lack of services. We are constantly trying, without qualified knowledge, to help children and what we can offer depends on school funds and whether we can get specialist help, such as a counsellor on site. The CAMHS professional helpline is my biggest support. I\u2019ve had many a conversation about children who I knew didn\u2019t meet the threshold for referral but still needed help. The people on the lines are always supportive, never laugh when I say for the millionth \u201cSorry to bother you, but ...\u201d and \u201cI hope I\u2019m not wasting your time, but ...\u201d and they certainly always have a way forward in terms of strategies to implement and interventions to support a child. However, this usually isn\u2019t enough and the children really need one-to-one professional help as soon as possible. We need to have a real focus on what the different branches of mental health are, how to identify them, where to go for support when you don\u2019t meet the criteria for diagnostic assessment and examples of interventions to implement for each problem area.</p> <h2>Stacey Hirons, 42, work in crisis intervention, Coventry</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"3bd52c747c77134efc09b62eacd95df14223e222\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3bd52c747c77134efc09b62eacd95df14223e222/0_0_280_280/280.png\" alt=\"Stacey Hirons\" width=\"280\" height=\"280\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>I work for Coventry\u2019s crisis intervention service, supporting young people aged 11 to 18 (although often we have younger referrals, too). In my experience CAMHS is a service under immense pressure with substantial waiting times. When support does come it can change crisis situations overnight. Frustratingly, this is the exception. We are also often told CAMHS cannot work with a child until their home situation is settled, but mental health issues put enormous stresses on families, meaning the situations are unlikely to be resolved without CAMHS support. It\u2019s a vicious circle. One other bugbear is that CAMHS are not able to visit families at home and see the young people in their real-life contexts. This is especially difficult for our service: a young person who is too anxious, aggressive or violent to attend school and/or be out in the community is hardly going to want to come to hospital appointments. In my experience, sometimes there are delays and sometimes the service is brilliant at responding. What is really needed is investment from central government, and work done to create a positive message about the importance of mental wellbeing. <br></p> <h2>Stuart Hannah, child and adolescent psychotherapist, Leeds<br></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"23d76ca0354192ba438dc48338663fcc6332c9ca\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/23d76ca0354192ba438dc48338663fcc6332c9ca/0_0_280_280/280.png\" alt=\"Stuart Hannah\" width=\"280\" height=\"280\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>I have worked in different child and adolescent mental health services in London and the south-east as well as the Yorkshire region since 2003, when I left social care to specialise in child mental health. The work is interesting and varied in as much as you never really know what stories people have to tell about their lives and what will unfold in the consulting room. </p> <p>However, the work is undertaken in a context of perpetual change and economic uncertainty. Every service I have been in has suffered from collective low morale and very high levels of uncertainty about the future. To a degree, a traumatised workforce is trying to work with a traumatised population and this is a worrying cocktail. </p> <p>Parents often arrive thinking there is something wrong with their child and expect you to make them better immediately. As stories unfold, it usually emerges that difficulties are collectively located in all family members to varying degrees, as well as the parental couple relationship, formative experiences in early childhood and the modus operandi of the parents. </p> <p>I wonder whether CAMHS should be completely rethought and stripped back to basics. I am partly reassured by the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/414024/Childrens_Mental_Health.pdf\">Future in Mind agenda</a> and some of the local transformation plans. The emphasis on multi-agency collaboration makes good sense as does matching service provision closely to local need, identified via robust data collection.</p> <p> However, the collective wellbeing of children and families in our society directly correlates with economic and social realities and their impact on how people, particularly parents, feel. Now more than ever we need to encourage empathy in all human relationships, and in communities underpinned by core values of respect, compassion, tolerance and equal opportunities for all. Properly funded and creatively delivered, CAMHS can make an active contribution to empathy development in individuals, families and organisations, but it needs to be thought of as part of a broader picture of how we want our society to look in a decade\u2019s time.</p> <h2>Anonymous, Herefordshire</h2> <p>When my daughter was 10, she struggled with the fact that her father had decided he no longer wanted contact. This really knocked her for six. She became angry and tearful. She\u2019d come home and scream and hit her pillow. She\u2019d burst into tears at random times. Her work at school suffered. I went to the GP and explained the problems and asked for counselling. He said her school should provide help for this. Her primary school had nothing they could offer so I asked for help through the NHS. She was referred to CAMHS but they sent a letter back explaining that they couldn\u2019t help as she didn\u2019t meet the criteria. I looked into private treatment, but as a single parent I couldn\u2019t afford private counselling at \u00a340 a session.</p> <p>When my daughter reached secondary school, they were far more helpful and provided weekly counselling sessions for a year and a half. My daughter is now doing much better at school and is no longer angry any more. She understands that the situation is not her fault. If it hadn\u2019t been for her secondary school I\u2019m not sure what state she would be in now. </p> <p>There appears to be no help for children experiencing mental health issues unless they\u2019ve reached a point of self-harm. CAMHS need to intervene at an early stage to prevent further harm. In my experience, as an adult you can walk into a GP surgery and come out with a referral for six sessions of therapy. This facility doesn\u2019t seem to exist for children.</p> <h2>Anonymous, 24</h2> <p>I was looked after by children\u2019s mental health services from the age of 13 to 18. I went to see my GP at the age of 12 because of depression due to bullying. I didn\u2019t know what to do and, when I went to see them, my parents didn\u2019t know what to do. My school was terrible, really unhelpful. My doctor explained that there was a long waiting list to be seen and it was during this wait that I tried to kill myself. In fact, one of the only negatives of my experience was the long waiting time to get help. I understand it\u2019s even worse now, which is worrying.</p> <p>After I made an attempt on my life, I was seen straight away and the care I received from that point was excellent. There\u2019s no doubt in my mind that the nurses and doctors who cared for me saved my life. I always felt supported and listened to. The nurses always wanted to help me. Even though it\u2019s their job to listen, it felt like they really cared. Also, because I was 13, it would have been easy for those looking after me to just say, \u201cWe know what is best for you,\u201d but they always took my opinion on board. They listened to my feelings.</p> <p>I saw a range of psychiatrists and counsellors over the years, and was diagnosed with a variety of conditions including anxiety and agoraphobia (a fear of being in public places). I had my ups and downs, but steadily got better during my time with them. I never tried to kill myself again.</p> <p>I do feel that the transition to adult mental health services is difficult. It felt strange that as soon as I turned 18 I could not be seen any more unless I went somewhere else. This felt really scary, and it would be good if there were more support in place or if the transition was slower and more gradual.</p> <h2>Anonymous, children\u2019s mental health services</h2> <p>I work in CAMHS and we are massively underfunded. As well as this a lot of third-sector organisations that used to look after young people\u2019s wellbeing have been cut or shut, which means we cannot refer people elsewhere if they don\u2019t meet our threshold. I have been working with CAMHS for many years in a range of different areas. The biggest challenge is demand v capacity. There\u2019s massive expectations on staff to deliver but with very limited resources. That\u2019s one of the biggest frustrations because we are here to help young people and sometimes feel we simply cannot do our job. It feels like the NHS is being slowly deconstructed and staff morale is so low.</p> <p>We do sometimes have to turn people away we should see because we get so many referrals, and this means the threshold for who we can help keeps changing. What we can now deliver is care for those in acute need. There are now a lot of young people who are left to struggle until it gets to the point of acute crisis. They don\u2019t receive help early enough.</p> <p>From a staff perspective, we feel frustrated and under a great deal of pressure. The systems we use are slow, clunky and inefficient. CAMHS does care about young people and does want to provide the best service, but people\u2019s expectations are unrealistic as they don\u2019t understand the stress we are under. It\u2019s not that we are not interested or not working hard enough, we simply don\u2019t have the capacity. </p> <h2>Abby, 19, west Sussex <br></h2> <p>I first sought help about three months before my 18th birthday, but because of my age CAMHS refused to see me. They said that by the time my referral was processed I would be an adult. The first \u2013 and only \u2013 time I saw a CAMHS worker was in hospital after I\u2019d tried to kill myself two weeks before my birthday. <br></p> <p>There should be something in place to help people who are not quite old enough for adult services, but deemed too young for children\u2019s ones. For example, if someone was 17 and a half years-old at the time of their first assessment, they could be referred to adult services instead of CAMHS. I think this would prevent people like me from falling through the net. <br></p> <p>Now I am an adult, I have a wonderful GP who is hugely supportive and proactive in fighting my corner and making sure I get the help I need.</p> <h2>Tina McGuff, 46, Dundee<br></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"bb69f3387ac576e58f9292ce5b3a03ac607c87fe\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bb69f3387ac576e58f9292ce5b3a03ac607c87fe/0_0_280_280/280.png\" alt=\"Tina McGuff\" width=\"280\" height=\"280\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>I work in finance but do mental health support voluntarily after setting up my own charity. My charity is for young people and I help families try to access services. I also give talks about my experiences with mental illness in schools and universities to raise awareness and break the stigma. I want to help children get seen before they reach crisis point. <br></p> <p>When I was younger, I was sectioned under the Mental Health Act with anorexia and I nearly died. I also ended up having a psychotic episode in my 20s and suffered from orthorexia until my mid 30s. I am now fully recovered and have published a book about how we have to help each other and lift the lid on these problems. </p> <p>I visit parents who need advice in helping their children, offering them support and a shoulder to cry on. I also try to put them in touch with other experts who might be able to help. The most common problem they have is not being able to get an appointment with CAMHS quickly. In one instance a girl tried to kill herself in January but wasn\u2019t seen until June. That is just unacceptable.<br></p> <p>We need ring-fenced resourced money to fund mental health services in this country and more support in schools. I talk in schools and this can make a huge difference. Often kids will come and talk to me afterwards and tell me about their own issues. The school can jump in and help that individual. Early intervention is key and if we as a society can talk about mental health openly then it will help save lives.<br></p> <h2>Anonymous, 39, North Yorkshire</h2> <p>My son is 14 and was referred to CAMHS last year with anxiety and intrusive thoughts. His issues gradually appeared \u2013 it started with him having nightmares, and then he got upset over minor things. Soon it developed into daily panic attacks at school. These issues came after a particularly difficult year with seven deaths in the family and a divorce between myself and his father. We also moved four times in six months, so this could have contributed to his stress.<br></p> <p>We went to the doctor and they immediately referred him, but it was eight weeks before he was assessed. In this time, he was offered no support and I was surprised by how long it took. Luckily, he didn\u2019t decline too much during this period, but it was still a battle to get to school, and he worked out that if he said he was sick then he would be sent home.</p> <p>After his assessment, he was seen once a week and offered cognitive behaviour therapy as well as mindfulness techniques etc. It has really improved his anxiety but he still suffers from intrusive thoughts. He believes he is worthless, a burden and that everyone hates him. This aspect isn\u2019t really being dealt with and now it\u2019s time for him to be discharged. He has been told essentially that he has a certain amount of time to recover and if that doesn\u2019t happen then tough. He will leave the service without some issues being appropriately handled.<br></p> <h2>Anonymous worker, mental health social worker<br></h2> <p>One of the issues is the lack of hospital beds and specialist units. Often the situation you get is that on a national scale, children will be shifted around the country because there aren\u2019t enough beds on a local level. Where I work, for example, children end up far away from their family after assessment. I recently saw a child who was placed miles away and they were detained in hospital for their own protection, against their will. They spent nearly a month away from home and then stayed in hospital for treatment. These children are isolated from their families, from services and professionals local to where they live. He was away from school and friends in a little private hospital. It wasn\u2019t even an NHS bed \u2013 and it\u2019s not uncommon for the NHS to pay private hospitals in this way.</p> <p>I see this happen often. This year, in terms of the assessments I\u2019ve made on children, it\u2019s happened a lot. It hinders recovery because young people need to be in a local hospital, where they have local community teams feeding in. They also need to be discharged as soon as possible to maintain a normal school and family life.</p> <h2>Kerry-Mae Doogan, 21, Wigan</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"5e0f74afb5385a2b812923a8b701628fa0060189\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5e0f74afb5385a2b812923a8b701628fa0060189/0_0_280_280/280.png\" alt=\"Kerry-Mae\" width=\"280\" height=\"280\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>I was first referred to CAMHS aged 14 by my family GP. At the time there was a waiting list of up to a year for help, and in the end I waited for more than seven months to be assessed. Once I was seen by CAMHS I was moved between workers and my regular appointments were often cancelled without warning. In the end I discharged myself from the service because it was doing me more harm than good. Instead I went to a local charity counselling service which I found much more helpful. </p> <p>I experienced delays before and after the initial assessment. In that time my health got worse, although I was fortunate I was able to cope during this period.</p> <p>My experience would have been improved by not being shuffled between various workers who made me repeat my background information over and over again.</p> <p>I have been in recovery for two years now and I no longer use medication or have much contact with mental health services. When I was 18, I got involved with the Royal College of Psychiatrists as a young adviser to their quality networks for inpatient and community CAMHS. I am working with them to improve standards of child mental health services. I don\u2019t want other children to be let down the way I was.</p> <h2>Natalie Milner, 22, Leeds </h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"ebe86e5f98eea1dd24b327c745d97ef19d718011\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ebe86e5f98eea1dd24b327c745d97ef19d718011/0_0_280_280/280.png\" alt=\"Natalie Milner\" width=\"280\" height=\"280\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>I had panic attacks during school several times before I finally asked my mum to help me. We made an appointment with the doctor about one or two months after the first attack.</p> <p>The doctor seemed convinced I thought the attacks were heart attacks, which she brushed off, by saying: \u201cYou know you didn\u2019t have a heart attack don\u2019t you?\u201d I never mentioned a heart attack \u2013 I didn\u2019t know what was going on with my body. She suggested next time it happened to just carry a paper bag around with me and ventilate into it. She never told me what a panic attack was and never gave any thought to me having anxiety issues. <br></p> <p>My mum eventually pushed for a referral and, after a six-month wait, I received cognitive behavioural therapy through CAMHs. I continued to have panic attacks more and more frequently during the waiting period. I remember it making me feel scared to be in public and made me more and more isolated from my friends. No one really understood what I was going through. I once had a panic attack in front of my best friend and she said, \u201cOh please don\u2019t\u201d. I didn\u2019t have help or a diagnosis, so to everyone else it seemed like I was acting out. </p> <p>I feel my age was definitely the reason why I wasn\u2019t taken seriously. I felt like they all thought, \u201cWhat do you have to worry about \u2013 you\u2019re just at school\u201d. Everyone believed it was all my control and that I could choose not to have panic attacks and choose not to be depressed. My mum wouldn\u2019t let me tell my grandparents as she didn\u2019t think they\u2019d understand. </p> <p>I remember asking adults, teachers and my doctor every week and I never got the answer to what this was (a panic disorder). I found out what a panic attack was on the internet late at night and finally it all made sense. I can now control my panic attacks if they resurface thanks to the help of the CBT I had when I was a child. I just wish I had been taken more seriously from the start.<br></p> <h2>Anonymous, 47, Monmouthshire</h2> <p>Last year, my child, who had been having suicidal thoughts for at least two years, was diagnosed with severe depression and anxiety disorder. She was 15 at the time.</p> <p>We were lucky she had enough of a self-preservation instinct to see a school counsellor who got her to see the GP. We were told there was at least a nine-month wait to be treated by the CAMHS in south Wales. Even though she was feeling suicidal, because she hadn\u2019t actually self-harmed she wasn\u2019t enough of a high-risk patient to make her a priority, so she had to wait. During this time I watched my compassionate, funny, lovely daughter disappear before my eyes. She became angry, sad, lonely and despairing. Her social life was non-existent and her grades got worse as her anxiety grew. She was referred to a private psychologist who saw her for seven months twice a month. It cost a fortune, but we had no choice.</p> <p>Gradually she improved but the psychologist thought medication would be useful. In order to get this prescribed she had to see a consultant psychiatrist, which happened within six weeks of a second referral to CAMHS.</p> <p>Since then she\u2019s been on a low dose of medication and has agreed to do some group therapy to deal with her anxiety. CAMHS and the NHS have been great now she\u2019s in the system, but I don\u2019t want to think what would have happened if we hadn\u2019t got her help privately in the long wait to be seen. During that wait she has battled with her feelings of despair and studied for GCSEs. It was an incredibly stressful time for her.</p> <p>Our experience would have been greatly improved if she\u2019d been referred more quickly. By the time a child asks for help they are already quite unwell. Initial help needs to come within a couple of weeks. It\u2019s very hard to ask for help and the longer mental health issues go on, the harder they are to resolve.</p> <ul> <li><em>In the UK and Ireland the Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123.

  "<p>First eviction weekend: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/live/2016/oct/01/strictly-come-dancing-2016-week-two-live\">what a jaw-dropper</a>. As if Judge Rinder as a dancing Ken doll, Naga\u2019s insane hair extensions and Ed Balls dressed as one of the Dukes of Hazzard weren\u2019t enough, there was an actual scandal. </p> <p>In a show where Craig wearing a loud shirt is shocking, Anastacia\u2019s decision not to compete in the dance-off was the closest Strictly comes to controversy. Top marks to her for refusing to dance with a severe injury, the only sensible thing to do in the circumstances. Of course, it\u2019s a bit sad for Melvin, who didn\u2019t get a chance to redeem himself. A slightly weird and unsatisfactory result.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/sep/26/strictly-come-dancing-judges-go-full-panto-villain-week-one\">'Don\u2019t get on my wick' \u2013 the Strictly judges go full panto villain, already</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Meanwhile, the knockout star of this series so far is not Danny Mac (although he\u2019s great) \u2013 it\u2019s Oti Mabuse, the South African professional dancer who was paired with boxer Anthony Ogogo in her debut series last year. Mabuse\u2019s choreography is knock-out and she somehow manages to conceal the off-putting Terminator drive that she no doubt possesses in spades. This is hers to lose.</p> <p>The judges meanwhile already seemed a little impatient. \u201cFirm, fair, fearless, unflappable or as we like to call them ... the judges.\u201d Well, I\u2019m sure they\u2019re fearless and unflappable, but they are usually more concerned with being encouraging and patronising than firm and fair at this stage in the competition, leaving it to Craig to be the only one who admits what we really just saw.</p> <h2>Darcey: woman of a thousand hairstyles</h2> <p>Dressed first as a brunette version of the evil duchess from The Sound of Music and then as queen of the prom, Darcey does seem a bit more relaxed this series. Is she going to escape being typecast as the lady lech? She looked embarrassed when Ore was being a hunky firefighter in her face and couldn\u2019t seem to recover in time for the comments: \u201cWe\u2019ve got a night, haven\u2019t we?\u201d (What?) \u201cYour hands were a bit frilly in places,\u201d she added. Hilariously, Ore took this as a compliment, demonstrating a level of delusional self-belief that bodes well for his survival in this competition.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"034b8bcecd5471cf25980e7b1b730eaaeb74b3f1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/034b8bcecd5471cf25980e7b1b730eaaeb74b3f1/601_49_2853_1712/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Frilly hands...

It is the intention behind it. It is telling story.\u201d This is what Bruno lives for: the intention. And it explains why he will mark a dance slightly higher even if it\u2019s not technically perfect. Bruno is also brilliant at euphemisms, sitting somewhere between Len\u2019s head pats and Darcey\u2019s platitudes. To Will Young: \u201cYour performance level is brilliant.\u201d This is Bruno code for: \u201cYour dancing is not brilliant.\u201d</p> <h2>Len: the diamond geezer on a farewell tour</h2> <p>\u201cClamp it down early doors!\u201d Len was laying down the law about lifts, which has been his trademark from series one. And he enjoyed having a disagreement with Craig about Claudia\u2019s hyperextension. Speaking as neither a dancer or an acrobat, I applaud her flexibility but I\u2019m with Craig here: it\u2019s not ballroom dancing, is it? I wonder if Len is picking a fight with Craig for the sake of it: \u201cCraig\u2019s philosophy is: \u2018Never leave a turn unstoned.\u2019\u201d Ouch. Len should not be underestimated. Of all the judges, he seems in the most control of his pigeonhole. Tess (on Danny): \u201cLen thought he\u2019d fallen asleep and woken up in week 10.\u201d Cue daggers from Len. He might be retiring. But it\u2019s not because he\u2019s knackered. It\u2019s because he\u2019s had enough.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"052edc4fa4304313384b68164cc8e8b43dcf98b2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/052edc4fa4304313384b68164cc8e8b43dcf98b2/0_233_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Anastacia and dance partner Brendan Cole in dress rehearsal.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Anastacia and dance partner Brendan Cole in dress rehearsal.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Guy Levy/BBC/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Craig: the great choreographer trapped inside a pantomime dame</h2> <p>It broke my heart when Craig had to give advice to Anastacia, who risked longer-term injury (and was evidently in pain). He was kind and constructive. Did the shock of Craig\u2019s compassion push her over the edge? \u201cIf Craig is being generous to me, maybe it really is a bad idea to dance with torn scar tissue from a mastectomy.\u201d Seriously.

But I\u2019m not sure. Thank you to three of the judges.\u201d Yes, yes, we get it. Craig is the bad guy. Craig on Melvin: \u201cYour posture was a worry.

  "<p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/theresamay\">Theresa May</a> has announced her plans for Brexit, insisting that controlling immigration and withdrawing from the jurisdiction of the European court of justice would be her priorities during European Union (EU) exit. She says Article 50 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/02/may-on-collision-course-with-backbenchers-seeking-soft-brexit\">will be triggered before March</a>. </p> <p>So, with our departure from the EU now in sight, how do those who made the decision to leave or remain feel now?</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/29/100-days-since-the-brexit-vote-how-do-you-feel-now\">We asked our readers about this to mark 100 days since Britain voted to leave the EU, and we received over 1,000 responses</a>.<br></p> <p>We had responses from people who had backed each of the opposing camps, and some people who didn\u2019t vote at all. 95% of them said that they did not regret their decision.</p> <p>How do you feel about the vote now, especially after May\u2019s latest announcement? Below, five people explain what it has meant to them. Share your thoughts in the comments.<br></p> <h2>Leavers</h2> <h2>Ed, 23, from Amersham: \u2018The only regrets I have is the way the referendum was won\u2019</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"a24cee8c75f561d866fe54b2de7b3343edff9442\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a24cee8c75f561d866fe54b2de7b3343edff9442/0_0_280_280/280.png\" alt=\"edmund bannister\" width=\"280\" height=\"280\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>I voted Leave for several reasons. Firstly, the EU\u2019s involvement in other countries can be meddling. Also, there wasn\u2019t much sympathy for Greece and the union left them to limp along while imposing further austerity measures. The migrant crisis has been handled badly as well, and Merkel\u2019s stance of open doors isn\u2019t realistic for every country.<br></p> <p>Federalisation works in America but Europe has history and attempting to unify a continent as diverse as it creates tensions.<br></p> <p>Nothing has really changed so far so it\u2019s hard to tell whether I see the benefits having been reaped. I doubt there will be serious long-term effects for our economy. We had the wrong government in place to deal with Brexit (I contemplated voting stay for this reason) but it felt like it was once in a lifetime opportunity. I know there wouldn\u2019t be another chance to vote leave.<br></p> <p>The only regrets and concerns I have is the way the referendum was won \u2013 for example claims that \u00a3350m would be given to the NHS. I think leaving, however, was the best idea. If we are now allowed to limit immigration to skilled workers then that would be very beneficial. I do have some objections to importing a workforce of unskilled workers. This creates more tensions. I don\u2019t think the EU is the force for peace it brands itself. I am glad that Article 50 will invoked in 2017. </p> <h2>Alka Sehgal Cuthbert, 54, from London: \u2018I am very pleased with my decision\u2019</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"c07a0ef5ad119bf2b82550fb62b546db67c2429c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c07a0ef5ad119bf2b82550fb62b546db67c2429c/0_0_280_280/280.png\" alt=\"Alka Sehgal Cuthbert\" width=\"280\" height=\"280\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>I voted Leave and I am very pleased with my decision. I\u2019m glad that after years of politics being technocratic, soul-destroying and tedious, people in Britain experienced an inkling of what politics has been \u2013 and could \u2013 be again. The lack of a plan for every economic and political eventuality is not a problem, it is something that is a chance for everyone to consider how he or she would like to re-vivify public political culture. Let\u2019s face it our political and economic situation was pretty poor to start with, so why not ask bigger questions, or start from a different point? The only real impact of Brexit on my life has been that my family holiday was more expensive, and some of our savings for children\u2019s education may have been adversely affected.</p> <h2>Remainers </h2> <h2> Allan Collins, 85, from Scotland: \u2018Since the vote I have seen chaos and muddled thinking\u2019<br></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"dd0126b1321e303d619f859b3bbd112526a26a92\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dd0126b1321e303d619f859b3bbd112526a26a92/0_0_280_280/280.png\" alt=\"Allan Collins\" width=\"280\" height=\"280\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p> I voted Remain. I feel even more certain now, that like most of my fellow Scots, I voted correctly. At my age I lived through the dark days of a divided Europe. I saw the human wrecks caused by the first world war, and the devastation of the second. All because of a divided Europe.<br></p> <p>Over the last few years I have enjoyed the pleasure of travelling freely to European countries, and I have seen the improvement to infrastructure in the Highland and Islands. I have felt very much part of the family of Europe. I have felt the security of being part of that great united family. <br></p> <p>Since the vote I have seen chaos and muddled thinking. There seems to be no strategy or plan to move forward. Government ministers seem to be completely divided and we are becoming a laughing stock. We talk about getting the right terms, but what do we have to bargain with? <br> </p> <p>At this early stage, the result hasn\u2019t affected my life or finances but I am certain it will. And not in a good way. <br></p> <h2>Helen Quenet, 56 from Hatfield: \u2018I hate what the UK has become in these 100 days\u2019<br></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"632c885bcb967b6a14e5061e602ee2d71994af1e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/632c885bcb967b6a14e5061e602ee2d71994af1e/0_0_280_280/280.png\" alt=\"Helen Quenet\" width=\"280\" height=\"280\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>I voted Remain and am still shocked and angry at what happened. I\u2019m hoping some way will be found to stop it. I believe it is a huge self-inflicted wound that will damage the county irreparably.</p> <p> I\u2019m especially disgusted with the racism and abuse that the result has provoked. I have a Belgian name because I married someone who was \u201conly\u201d fourth generation British. My youngest son risks missing out on Erasmus and my 85-year-old mum risks losing all the lovely carers she has from Europe. I hate what the UK has become in these 100 days. <br></p> <p>If I could get a European passport I would leave the country. Unfortunately that isn\u2019t an option available for me. </p> <h2>Smiley, 31 from London: \u2018It is the slow dissolution of Britain as a tolerant safe society\u2019<br></h2> <p>I voted to Remain and am now thinking of moving to Canada. The result of the vote is the slow dissolution of Britain as a tolerant safe society with rights blinking out like stars on a cloudy night and violent thugs feeling enabled to harass and murder in the street. The economic future potential of this nation will be occulted for years and I don\u2019t think anything can be done to stop unemployment rising and the standard of living from falling.<br></p> <p>Because the company where I work has a lot of EU funded projects and relies to a greater than average degree on a predictable model of population and economic growth, all predicted models have been thrown into chaos and there\u2019s a general air of uncertainty and dread which is the background of all conversations on future plans.</p> <p>I\u2019m not married and don\u2019t have children so I don\u2019t have as many emotional ties as some. Besides look at the way things are going. If Article 50 is enacted then I can look forward to a future of xenophobia, reduced ability to work and travel, and my rights left unprotected by EU Human Rights Legislation. If I had children, this isn\u2019t a country I would want to bring them up in.</p>",

The new research suggests this practice is misguided. We already know that those with pre-existing depression may find the pill <a href=\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010782408004010\">worsens their symptoms</a>, and if teens were at greater risk of depression, then continuing this practice would be negligent.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/19/pregnancy-mental-health-birth-childbirth\">Pregnancy and mental health: the hidden pain of giving birth</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The researchers note that, because GPs are less likely to prescribe the pill to women who already have depression and because women who do experience depression on the pill are more likely to stop taking it, this study probably underestimates the potential negative affect that hormonal contraceptives can have on mental health. </p> <p>Having spent the past eight years researching and writing on the emotional and psychological side-effects of hormonal birth control, I initially felt elated to read this study.

As soon as this research dropped, the experts lined up to deliver their usual mix of gaslighting and paternalistic platitudes. We\u2019re told not to be alarmed, concerned, or deterred from continuing to use our hormonal contraceptives, mostly by men who have never and will never take them themselves (partly because the long-term, <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6445254\">large-scale study</a> undertaken by WHO on the \u201cacceptability\u201d of the male pill revealed it would negatively impact their emotional wellbeing).</p> <p>This \u201cpillsplaining\u201d is specific to discussions of research into the side-effects of hormonal birth control. Usually, when the research is on the pill alone, we\u2019re quickly informed there are many other hormone-based methods to choose from, but unfortunately this new study says those alternatives are even worse. One expert even tried to dismiss the link with depression in pill-taking teens as more likely the result of <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/how-your-birth-control-could-be-affecting-your-mood_us_57eac31ee4b024a52d2b13c4\">\u201cteen heartbreak\u201d</a>.</p> <p>So, why is it that we\u2019re not supposed to take this study seriously? Considering that women are fertile just <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC27529/\">six days per menstrual cycle</a> and men are fertile every single day, that the burden of avoiding unwanted pregnancy falls to us, regardless of the burden that might have on our health and wellbeing, is nothing short of sexism. After all, there are certainly effective alternatives to hormonal contraceptives \u2013the copper coil, diaphragm, condoms and <a href=\"http://www.gadgette.com/2016/08/12/daysy-review\">new technology</a> that\u2019s making it simple for women to practice the <a href=\"http://humrep.oxfordjournals.org/content/22/5/1310.full\">fertility awareness method</a>, not to mention, of course, vasectomy and the promise of <a href=\"http://www.sciencealert.com/reversible-male-birth-control-just-passed-another-trial-and-could-be-on-sale-within-2-years\">Vasalgel</a>, a contraceptive injection for men.</p> <p>Yet, we\u2019re reminded with one medical professional\u2019s <a href=\"http://nymag.com/thecut/2016/09/link-between-hormonal-birth-control-and-depression-study.html\">response</a> to this new research that \u201can unwanted pregnancy far outweighs all the other side effects that could occur from a contraceptive.\u201d If that\u2019s true, why bother researching the side-effects at all?</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It is important to remember that women are twice as likely to experience depression as men</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>It is important to remember that women are twice as likely to experience depression as men, reportedly due to \u201cthe fluctuation of progesterone and oestrogen levels\u201d, in other words our biological femaleness.

  "<p>When Graham Alexander took control at Scunthorpe United nine games from the end of last season one eye was already trained on how to improve a stagnant team during the summer. Simultaneously, though, the former right-back guided The Iron, in 13th when he was named as Mark Robins\u2019s replacement, to seven wins and a draw, leaving them with a decent shout of what had, a few weeks earlier, seemed an unlikely play-off place, going into the final game.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/football-league-blog/2016/sep/12/oxford-chris-maguire-fans-favourite-swindon-derby-goals\">It did not quite work out</a> pipped by the eventually-promoted Barnsley, but their impressive form has continued and a team who have too often specialised in the mundane sit pretty on top of League One. The tempestuous 2-1 triumph on Saturday at Bury, who were second before kick-off and won every fixture last month, may have been the sweetest yet.</p> <p>Their hero, once again, was one of Alexander\u2019s summer additions. Josh Morris is the leading goalscorer in Europe. Disrupted by injuries, the left-winger found the net only once at Bradford last season. This time round he has a dozen.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/football-league-blog/2016/oct/01/football-league-your-thoughts-tammy-abraham-strikes-again-for-bristol-city\">Football League your thoughts: Tammy Abraham strikes again for Bristol City</a> </p> </aside>  <p>His winner here, at a time where the hosts were finding opportunities easier to come by, was probably the pick of the bunch: 25 yards from goal he took a heavy first touch after receiving a pass from Scott Wiseman but swung a spellbinding curler into the top left corner of Ben Williams\u2019s goal. \u201cIt\u2019s up there with my best, especially considering the circumstances,\u201d Morris said. \u201cIt was a tough game for us because we had our backs to the wall for a period.\u201d</p> <p>Morris is playing as if he has a point to prove. Struggles at Valley Parade aside, the 24-year-old is driven by life at Blackburn, the club he joined as a 12-year-old, not turning out as planned. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing worse than not playing football,\u201d he said. \u201cThis year the main thing was for me to get back playing.\u201d</p> <p>Before his moment of genius Bury were buzzing following Tom Soares\u2019s equaliser. Their position in the table has been a little more surprising. Equidistant between the play-offs and relegation last season, they inflicted a 4-1 thumping of Port Vale on 3 September that kick-started a run of five wins in a row and brought in their biggest crowd of the season here, with the sense of excitement noticeable before kick-off. There was a raucous atmosphere from the off and the game was similarly frantic, even if clear-cut chances were not exactly plentiful.</p> <p>Scunthorpe went in front with their first attempt on target in the 42nd minute. For once Wiseman was not foolish to rush in. Coming back into the team after being dropped in midweek, the Gibraltar defender was most alert in nosebleed territory when arriving to turn home Tom Hopper\u2019s ball across the face of goal.</p> <p>It shocked Bury into life and at various points the game threatened to boil over with neither afraid to get stuck in. The referee, David Webb, tried to let the action flow but several hefty challenges went unpunished and he was met by scathing invective from the home support when heading down the tunnel at the break flanked by two burly security guards.</p> <p>The Shakers, somewhat depleted and giving a first start to the Manchester City loanee Kean Bryan, looked the better team after half-time and deserved to equalise. Soares, who had earlier picked up his fifth yellow of the season, bundled home Zeli Ismail\u2019s cross after getting in front of David Mirfin.</p> <p>Morris would have the final say, however. Flitcroft called him the \u201cleague\u2019s outstanding player at the moment\u201d but said: \u201cWe did enough to not lose the game; we\u2019ve done enough to win it. The stats will say we edged it but stats are no good.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Talking points</strong></h2> <p>\u2022 Tony Xia will not see another Aston Villa game in person until next month but the video evidence of Saturday\u2019s surrender at Preston was sufficient for the owner <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/oct/03/aston-villa-roberto-di-matteo-sacked\">to get rid of Roberto Di Matteo</a>. Last week the manager had promised a top-six finish but losing 2-0 at Deepdale with a squad containing \u00a350m of his own signings was just not good enough. Even worse is one win from 11. But who should replace Di Matteo in a position that is not exactly the most attractive proposition?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"28570e6c31e765d9ddf604906454b91bf16936de\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/28570e6c31e765d9ddf604906454b91bf16936de/0_238_4981_3651/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Roberto Di Matteo has been axed.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"733\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Roberto Di Matteo has been axed.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nathan Stirk/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u2022 It seems a lot longer than eight weeks ago but Fulham are a shadow of the side that dazzled on opening night against Newcastle. Slavisa Jokanovic said \u201che accepts responsibility\u201d after a 2-1 loss to QPR that also saw Sone Aluko miss a last-minute penalty stretched their run without a win to seven. The Cottagers have gone from the play-off places to 14th in a couple of weeks and soon serious questions will be asked of the manager\u2019s ability to guide them forward.</p> <p>\u2022 There is a similarly alarming run of form in south-east London. After going close to an immediate Championship return last season, much was expected of Neil Harris\u2019s Millwall this time. The ante-post favourites, however, have lost four in a row, the latest coming at Walsall. They have scored in every game but have not kept a clean sheet since the opening day win over Oldham \u2013 not a bad shout for those inclined to place a few quid on the both-teams-to-score market.</p> <p>\u2022 While Morris shone at Gigg Lane, the day\u2019s other big EFL star was Cambridge United\u2019s goalkeeper Will Norris. Leading 2-1 against Accrington in his 50th appearance for the club, he saved two injury-time penalties from Terry Gornell. Piero Mingoia\u2019s winning volley was well worth a watch, too.<br></p> <p>\u2022 The weather has not yet turned and Newport have already had two games postponed due to the pitch at Rodney Parade being waterlogged. It does not bode well, especially when the Dragons play rugby union on it every second week. Also spare a thought for Stevenage, who found out 90 minutes before kick-off that there would be no play.<br></p>",

He said there was a case for \u201ctargeted high-value investment in economic infrastructure\u201d to support the economy and make Britain more productive.</p> <p>Told he sounded more like former shadow chancellor Ed Balls than his predecessor, Osborne, Hammond said he hoped he sounded like a \u201cConservative pragmatist\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cOur circumstances have changed. The exit vote, the slowing of the world economy creates a new set of circumstances. And as we go into a period where inevitably there will be more uncertainty, we need to have the space to be able to support the economy through that,\u201d he told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme.</p> <p>The chancellor said he remained determined to achieve a balanced budget, while reiterating that this would happen in a \u201cpragmatic\u201d way without the need for a surplus this parliament.

First-time director Richard Tanne fleshes out just why this is the case. It is not simply their brilliance as orators. There is a sense, as much as one can get this from a screen, that they were once normal, perhaps not quite like you and I, but at least existing on a continuum that feels familiar. When you hear the names of George Osborne or Bush or indeed Donald Trump, that sense of connection just isn\u2019t there.

Every member of their side contributed, and they\u2019ll be delighted to have won the Ryder Cup back after eight years. A fitting tribute to Arnold Palmer, who will hopefully be looking down on Hazeltine from the great clubhouse in the sky.</p> <p><strong>Europe meanwhile will scuttle off and lick their wounds. </strong>Darren Clarke\u2019s side were soundly beaten, but they can be proud of Rory McIlroy, who came of age as a senior figure in the team, and have blooded a real gem in Thomas Pieters. They\u2019ll go again at Le Golf National in Paris in 2018. Jordan Spieth\u2019s already been on TV saying the US team have victory in their sights; it\u2019s going to be another wonderful brouhaha!

Have you ever thought that it\u2019s surely only a matter of time before a professional soccer star, celebrating a goal in the athletic style, mistimes his slide along the turf and splinters his kneecaps into a million bony shards? Similarly, pro golfers in the Ryder Cup really do go overboard with the high fives sometimes, don\u2019t they? There they are, slapping each other\u2019s hands, the tools of their trade, with feeling and a force that is surely excessive. Well, Patrick Reed and Jordan Spieth were certainly highly excited when Reed eagled 6 yesterday afternoon. Gimme five, partner! Don\u2019t leave me hangin\u2019! Problem is, it would seem Reed seriously jarred Spieth\u2019s finger during the throes of their ecstasy. That would explain Spieth\u2019s uncharacteristically dismal form for the remainder of that match; it also raises the question of his ability to compete properly in the singles today.</p> <p><strong>Word right now is, Spieth will be OK to face Henrik Stenson on the first tee at 11.15am. </strong>Phew. If he pulls out before, Darren Clarke will have to present his Special Envelope containing the name of the European player who\u2019d also drop out in such a circumstance. That player would be paired in the draw with Spieth, and their match would be marked down as a half. Henrik Stenson, instead of facing Spieth as originally planned, would move to play whoever the unlucky European was drawn to face. Perhaps Stenson\u2019s in the Special Envelope? Who knows. Anyway, that hopefully won\u2019t be necessary. Here\u2019s to Spieth being hale, hearty, and able to start and finish his match; if he tees off but has to withdraw hurt, Europe will win that one by default.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57f0edfee4b05962fdf4a170\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-02T11:22:44.776Z\">12.22pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>There haven\u2019t been many better individual performances in the entire history of the Ryder Cup than the one served up by Patrick Reed yesterday afternoon. </strong>Consider the context. The United States of America had gotten off to a dream start in the 41st Ryder Cup, 4-0 in the opening series, but by 5pm on Saturday had been hauled back to parity by a rugged European comeback. Reed and his playing partner Jordan Spieth had thrown away a four-hole lead and half-a-point in the morning; in the afternoon, they\u2019d let slip another dominant position, a three-hole lead against Justin Rose and Henrik Stenson frittered down to one. All of a sudden Europe had a realistic chance of getting something from two of the remaining three matches still out on the course. It was all in the balance.</p> <p><strong>But Reed is made of the right stuff. </strong>With Spieth strangely out of sorts, Reed had built the initial American lead in the match all by himself: three birdies and an eagle between holes 5 and 8. Now he put the foot to the floor again, with bang-bang birdies at 14 and 15, an immediate response to danger that catapulted US to dormie. They\u2019d tie up the match soon after. \u201cHe\u2019s Captain America for us,\u201d Jordan Spieth enthused. \u201cWhat a front nine he had with five birdies and an eagle on his own! Then on the back nine he came through on 14 and 15. He really birdied 16 as well and probably would have birdied 17 if he had to.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Good luck, then, to Reed\u2019s opponent in today\u2019s singles!</strong> Roaring Rory McIlroy has without question been Europe\u2019s answer to Reed, a force of nature raging against the dying of the European light. He\u2019s won three of Europe\u2019s six-and-a-half points, the high-water mark being that eagle at 16 on Friday, though he has done quite a lot of shouting too. His poor vocal cords must look like Harry Nilsson\u2019s after the Pussy Cats sessions. (Just throwing in a cutting-edge pop reference to keep the kids interested.) Rory has been a rare success story for Europe this week, the first name on a short list that also includes the rookies Thomas Pieters, Rafa Cabrera Bello and Chris Wood, and signally omits experienced wild-card picks Martin Kaymer and Lee Stadler-Westwood. His mano-a-mano duel with Reed promises fireworks. Can\u2019t wait!</p> <p><strong>Rory will need to put some blue on the board early if Europe are to have any chance of retaining their trophy. </strong>Problem for Darren Clarke\u2019s team is, even if he does that, their chances are slim: the USA only need five points from the 12 singles rubbers to win, and they\u2019ve been by far the better team this week. Their 9\u00bd-6\u00bd lead is thoroughly deserved. Lightning can strike twice, but the problem there is, we\u2019re not in Medinah any more. Still, you never know, and that\u2019s why we all love sport. Whatever happens, there are some sensational matches taking place this afternoon. It\u2019s going to be a hell of a ride, as the USA look to put an end to eight years of hurt, and reclaim the trophy they first won in 1927, and on 24 glorious occasions since.

  "<p>You learn early on that you\u2019re not going to make everything all right. Lots of kids just have very tough lives, whether one of their parents has a drink or drug problem, their dad\u2019s just died, or they are seeing a lot of fighting going on. Sometimes social services do something about it. Mostly, they don\u2019t because they simply can\u2019t.</p> <p>A lack of therapeutic intervention by social services is quite common in austerity Britain, and it was one of the big surprises when I started my career, working on the frontline of child mental health in schools. Indeed my local social services describe themselves as an \u201cemergency service\u201d, and increasingly seem to manage levels of risk, rather than help situations or people improve. In many parts of the country, Camhs \u2013 child and adolescent mental health services \u2013 is similarly stretched.</p> <p>When I did my training, I thought we would be taught how the human mind works \u2013 and how to fix it. I imagined we would be given a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/oct/25/colouring-in-classic-car-books-motoring-haynes\" title=\"\">Haynes care maintenance manual</a>, if you like. I was 35: probably too young, definitely too naive. I\u2019m 50 now, and understand less than ever about the complexities of emotions and thoughts that are inevitably ensnared in the kids I work with, and that\u2019s probably not so bad. After all, the last thing kids want is to be told what is good for them.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/social-care-network/ng-interactive/2014/aug/26/social-care-careers-an-interactive-guide\">Social care careers: an interactive guide</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Take one eight-year-old boy I worked with. The police had to step over needles and a stash of guns to find him cowering under a bed. He was taken into care and moved to a new school miles away, where I met him. But the social worker hadn\u2019t really explained to him why he\u2019d had to leave his dad. As a result he was deeply confused, and very untrusting.</p> <p>He would dive under the table as soon as our counselling sessions came to an end and growl like a dog, refusing to move. Reflecting on this with my supervisor, we wondered if it was where he felt safe, and in control. All behaviour is communication, as the saying goes. The last thing he wanted was to be dragged off somewhere new again by strangers. So we acted out the story of a hurt, distrustful puppy being placed with a new owner using puppets, and discussed how unsafe that dog must feel. It took a lot of time for the boy to feel more understood but he\u2019s doing better now.</p> <p>Social services\u2019 \u201cthresholds\u201d \u2013 the level of need at which they deem it necessary to intervene \u2013 are absurdly high at the moment. But that frustration never goes away. A colleague worked with a child who was seeing a lot of domestic violence at home, and helped her to plan a strategy for keeping herself safe and calling the police when things were kicking off. An hour later she got an irate phone call from a social worker telling her to stop interfering and to not place too much responsibility on the kid. That\u2019s as far as the new \u201cjoined-up thinking\u201d gets.</p> <p>My daughter is in year 3, and we\u2019ve been on several camping trips around the UK this summer. Only one of the 20 kids I work with each week has had more than a single day trip during that time. I had a comfortable and happy childhood, and it has been a real eye-opener seeing how hard so many families have it. I guess it\u2019s all about perspective, isn\u2019t it? If more people in the UK could visit the country\u2019s deprived estates and really get to grips with how life is there, maybe there would be a greater sense of compassion for struggling parents and families.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fc17f8ccb7acd3869e0a9108ff7d3a641de8e402\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fc17f8ccb7acd3869e0a9108ff7d3a641de8e402/0_47_1443_866/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Children drawing\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Quite often you need a light touch, even a bit of humour, to get things moving.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Someone I know recently posted a picture of two dogs she\u2019d adopted from Romania on Facebook. \u201cHow English is that,\u201d I thought. Forget the refugee children \u2013 let\u2019s look after the animals. Because, let\u2019s face it, children with deep emotional needs can be trickier to love than pets. Yet in forgotten corners of the UK, like the estates where I work, it is only the love and toil of the teachers and teaching assistants that is keeping the lights on for many kids right now.</p> <p>There are lovely things about working in primary schools: the community ethos, the values, the constant thinking about others, and the working-together ideal that teachers embody and hope the children will embrace. It\u2019s hard to square the Brexit vote with that, and unfortunately it seems to have unleashed some attitudes at home that have filtered through to the children. I\u2019ve heard of several racist remarks in schools since term started and have been asked to work with a Polish family who have faced hostility at the school gates.</p> <p>There is a focus on one-to-one therapy, but in practice, this isn\u2019t always the most effective route. I\u2019ve had far better results working with the parents or carers and children together. I\u2019m not the most confident of people, and some of the hardest moments are being with kids and their carers when they\u2019re at the end of their tether, or talking about the really difficult stuff. Quite often you need a light touch, even a bit of humour, to get things moving. If a kid draws a picture of tanks blowing up his parents, well, it\u2019s a starting point.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jun/13/secret-life-call-centre-worker\">The secret life of a call centre worker: a degree of compassion never hurts | Anonymous</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The pay is similar to teaching, but contracts are generally short term as funding is always shaky. Yet despite the difficulties, it\u2019s an undeniable privilege to work with children: their imagination, their energy \u2026 it\u2019s just wonderful.</p> <p>Us adults with our job titles and qualifications might think we know best, but kids often heal themselves through their friendships. It\u2019s a big ask of any kid to open up to a stranger who she only sees once a week for 45 minutes. Children with similar life experiences tend to gravitate towards each other. Sometimes just saying, \u201chey, you know Aidan in year 5 has been through the same stuff as you \u2013 he got adopted last year,\u201d is enough of a pebble to drop for two kids to get talking and things to make more sense for them.</p> <p>Children who constantly get into trouble tend to develop low self-esteem, no matter how hard they seem on the outside. They get to be known as \u201cthe bad kids\u201d, and they soon see themselves that way too. This doesn\u2019t leave much fuel in their tanks when it comes to wanting to change.

Doctors found to have assisted with a termination would also be liable for prosecution and a prison term.</p> <p>Critics say that would mean that even a woman who suffers a miscarriage could be under criminal suspicion, and that doctors might be put off conducting even routine procedures on pregnant women for fear of being accused of facilitating a termination. </p> <p>Although a ban has received public support from elements of the Catholic church and Poland\u2019s ruling rightwing Law and Justice party (PiS), neither initiated the proposals. They were drafted by hardline conservative advocacy group Ordo Iuris and submitted by the Stop Abortion coalition as a \u201ccitizens\u2019 initiative\u201d \u2013 a petition considered by parliament once it has received more than 100,000 signatures.</p> <p>When on 23 September the Polish parliament voted for Stop Abortion\u2019s proposals to be scrutinised by a parliamentary committee, pro-choice activists responded by calling a nationwide strike, or \u201cnational absence campaign\u201d, by women, encouraging them to take a day off work and domestic tasks and gather for meetings or demonstrations, to donate blood or do charity work.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/27/poland-rule-of-law-systematic-threat-european-commission\">Poland's rule of law under systematic threat, says EU executive</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Many Polish women say they are sick of deals being cut over their fundamental reproductive and human rights, which they argue threaten both their safety and their dignity.</p> <p>\u201cA lot of women and girls in this country have felt that they don\u2019t have any power, that they are not equal, that they don\u2019t have the right to an opinion,\u201d said Magda Staroszczyk, a strike co-ordinator. \u201cThis is a chance for us to be seen, and to be heard.\u201d</p> <p>Monday\u2019s protest was inspired by an all-out strike more than 40 years ago by the women of Iceland, when 90% of women refused to work, cook, or look after their children for a day in October 1975. </p> <p>Organisers cite an assault on women\u2019s reproductive rights that goes beyond the measures contained in Stop Abortion\u2019s proposed ban. A separate, PiS-sponsored bill restricting IVF (in vitro fertilisation), which would make it illegal to freeze embryos and allow women to fertilise only one embryo at a time, was also passed to the parliamentary committee stage in September.</p> <p>The Polish Federation of Pro-Life Movements, with the support of an MP from a rightwing parliamentary faction associated with Law and Justice, has called for a total ban of the morning-after pill.

  "<p><strong>My wife of 28 years has informed me that I fail to get hard or stay hard while having vaginal sex, perhaps 80%&#xa0;of the time. She says if it is oral, I&#xa0;am always ready to go. She is worried that&#xa0;I don\u2019t find her attractive. I am worried because I did not even realise. I am under a lot of stress, and suspect the problem is emotional not&#xa0;physical. </strong></p> <p>It is not necessarily \u201call in your head\u201d. Some men are simply more aroused by&#xa0;oral sex, whether enjoying it as a&#xa0;somewhat \u201ctaboo\u201d erotic act, as a visual stimulation, or being tantalised by the inherent relinquishing of control. But from a purely mechanical point of view, some men find that vaginal sex does not always provide the type of friction they need.</p> <p>As men age, they often experience a&#xa0;reduction in erectile firmness, as well as in the angle of elevation, and it is understandable that these changes may go unnoticed, since they usually don\u2019t affect their ability to achieve intercourse and ejaculate. But, unfortunately, partners often take these changes personally.</p> <p>I suspect that the best way forward is to find out what these changes really mean for your wife\u2019s sexual enjoyment. Focus on finding how to increase her stimulation and pleasure in ways other than intercourse, such as providing her with more direct manual or oral stimulation. And find ways to reduce your stress \u2013 and not just because it dramatically undermines sexual processes.</p> <p><em>\u2022 Pamela Stephenson Connolly is a US-based psychotherapist specialising in sexual disorders.</em></p> <p><em>\u2022 If you would like advice from Pamela Stephenson Connolly on sexual matters, send us a brief description of your concerns to </em><a href=\"mailto:private.lives@theguardian.com\" title=\"\"><em>private.lives@theguardian.com</em></a><em> (please don\u2019t send attachments).

  "<p>Like most people, I am not good with pain. So when period pains are setting in, I reach for the painkillers. I bypass the branded ones stacked at eye level on supermarket shelves, in fancy packaging with multicoloured, eye-catching logos. Instead, I buy plain-looking packs of generic painkillers. To select the analgesia I want, I look for the active ingredients printed on the box, not the promises.</p> <p>But it is no wonder that there is confusion. The range of over-the-counter medicines is huge and can be overwhelming, especially if you have a sore head and are feeling vulnerable. The product that shouts loudest, stating it will take away all your pain, is tempting.</p> <p>There are legitimate reasons why brand-leader medicines cost more. The pharmaceutical companies that produce them will have conducted the initial multi-million-pound drug research and trials essential for product safety. The more modestly priced generic medications are made by companies creating cheaper versions once the patents set by brand-leaders have expired. So are the more expensive drugs more effective than their cheaper, generic versions?</p> <p>The BBC2 series <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b04j9gny\">Trust Me I\u2019m a Doctor</a> turned to science to try to find out. Different types of painkillers, all containing ibuprofen, were selected, and scientists from the pharmaceutics laboratory at University College London devised a series of experiments. The first compared two well-known branded ibuprofen-containing products in the higher price category against three generic products. First, they looked at whether the products contained as much ibuprofen as was claimed on the box. In the UK, all licensed medications are tightly controlled by the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/medicines-and-healthcare-products-regulatory-agency\">Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Authority</a> (MHRA); reassuringly, each product contained ibuprofen at the right amount.</p> <p>The second set of tests tried to find out how quickly the drug was released from the tablets \u2013 the dissolution test \u2013 simulating how quickly the ibuprofen gets into a form which can get into our bloodstream. The results were revealing. When the tablets were added to solution, most of the products across the range started to release their drug almost immediately. The <a href=\"https://www.pharmacopoeia.com\">British Pharmocopeia guidelines</a> say that in order to sell a product on the market, a minimum percentage of active ingredient has to be released within a particular time. For ibuprofen tablets, this means that 75% of the drug has to be in solution within 45 minutes. Different products release drugs at different rates, but they all need to meet that minimum cut-off standard.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/apr/13/nurofen-deserves-6m-fine-for-false-claims-on-painkillers-court-told\">Nurofen maker deserves $6m fine for false claims, court told</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Simon Gaisford, head of the pharmaceutics department at UCL, explains: \u201cIf I\u2019m a company and I want to develop a generic version of a product, I have to demonstrate to the MHRA that my product is bio-equivalent to the brand leader.\u201d That means a new generic product has to reach the bloodstream at the same time as the brand leader. In this case, all the products tested did, regardless of price. The results did show variability in the release rates, but both the generic and branded products released the majority of the ibuprofen within 45 minutes. There was no significant difference between the different manufacturer\u2019s products.</p> <p>It would seem, therefore, there is no advantage in paying for more expensive tablets containing the active painkilling drug you want to use \u2013 the cheaper ones are just as good.<br></p> <p>But how many times have we heard products claiming to \u201ckill pain fast\u201d? Does paying more mean killing pain faster? These claims are also regulated by law in the UK. According to MHRA guidelines, in order to justify the claim of \u201cfast-acting\u201d, a drug has to have its onset of action taking place less than 30 minutes after oral administration. Two forms of \u201cfast\u2013acting\u201d ibuprofen products \u2013 one branded and one generic \u2013 were tested, and more than 75% of both drugs were in solution within 20 minutes \u2013 as opposed to 45 minutes for the standard products. Yet again, while both acted more quickly that the \u201cstandard\u201d versions, there\u2019s no advantage in paying more \u2013 the cheap, generic \u201cexpress\u201d products worked just as quickly as the expensive brands.</p> <p>Another marketing ploy is to specify a particular pain. Some of the big-selling brands, such as Nurofen, package ibuprofen into different products targeted at various types of pain. It might suggest there\u2019s something different in each box. In a statement to the BBC, Nurofen\u2019s maker, Reckitt Benckiser, stated: \u201cPain-specific products provide easy navigation of pain relief and consumer research indicates that seven in 10 people say these packs help them decide which product is best for their needs.\u201d</p> <p>Ibuprofen doesn\u2019t target just one area of pain, however, but works by dampening pain no matter where it is in the body. That\u2019s true of <em>any</em> ibuprofen product, regardless of price. It\u2019s also true of any painkilling drug you can buy over the counter, such as paracetamol. In 2015, an Australian court found that Reckitt Benckiser had misled the public by marketing four Nurofen products that claimed to target specific types of pain \u2013 back pain, period pain and headaches \u2013 when, in fact, it was exactly the same medicine in each box. The company states that any Nurofen products that have the same active ingredient, pack-size, format and formulation have the same manufacturer\u2019s recommended retail price. This year, though, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/jun/29/nurofen-tv-ad-banned-over-painkilling-claims-in-landmark-ruling\">Advertising Standards Authority took Nurofen to task</a> over one of the brand\u2019s \u201cpain specific\u201d adverts.</p> <p>But Nurofen isn\u2019t the only product marketing \u201cpain-specific\u201d ibuprofen. At the end of the day, the best guard against paying more is the knowledge that, under UK law, consumers are protected and can safely buy the cheapest versions on offer. If, however, you need to get on with your day free of pain, and you don\u2019t have the patience to wait, then you can pay more for the express version. But the generic fast-acting forms will do it just as effectively as the expensive brands in their fancy packaging.</p>",
  "<p>It is in September and October that we in Britain are most likely to spot spiders and their webs in our gardens and hedgerows. These are the gossamer days, when the silken threads strung over bushes and across gates and gaps catch the autumn sunshine. They seem ephemeral, but a new book on spider silk shows how it provides a whole arsenal, toolkit and material world for both spiders and humans.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/1907222359\">Gossamer Days</a> is by <a href=\"http://www.eleanormorgan.com/\">Eleanor Morgan</a>, an artist and writer whose <a href=\"http://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/1415915/\">PhD thesis</a> on human use of spider silk was undertaken at UCL\u2019s Slade School of Art and Department of Anthropology. This background means, firstly, that the book is full of images \u2013 Morgan\u2019s drawings and equipment as well as reproduced photographs, diagrams and artwork \u2013 and shows real feeling for materials and their properties. Secondly, it includes a very wide range of people, across time and place. It ranges technological innovation, natural history, ritual, myth, artistic practice and individual curiosity. As she says, these silken threads connect many stories.</p> <p>I was briefly in contact with the author when she was doing her PhD research and I was a curator at the Royal Observatory Greenwich (she is kind enough to include me in the acknowledgments). Spiders and observatories? Well, yes, indeed. As Morgan describes in her first chapter, for about two and a half centuries spider thread was used in the eyepieces of telescopes and other optical instruments as grids or crosshairs for accurate measurements or targeting.</p> <p>Early in my time at the Observatory I had come across the use of spider threads as telescope \u201cwires\u201d, the need to collect spiders or their webs from nearby bushes, and a curious object in the museum\u2019s collections that might be for collecting or storing spider silk. I had <a href=\"http://cosmicdiary1894.blogspot.co.uk/search?q=spider\">noted the practice</a> when putting the Observatory\u2019s 1894 journals online, and later <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/the-h-word/2012/dec/06/spider-astronomical-arachnids\">wrote about it</a> and an article by E. Walter Maunder, one of the Observatory\u2019s assistants, on \u201c<a href=\"http://articles.adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-iarticle_query?1894JBAA....4..243M&amp;data_type=PDF_HIGH&amp;whole_paper=YES&amp;type=PR%20INTER&amp;filetype=.pdf\">Making a Spider Line Reticule</a>\u201d. \u201cFirst\u201d, he said, \u201ccatch your spider\u201d, although, as Morgan shows, it is keeping and silking the spiders that really require skill. </p> <p>I love idea that it was \u201cthe silken thread of a female <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Araneus_diadematus\">European garden spider</a>, placed in the focus of the eyepiece of <a href=\"http://collections.rmg.co.uk/collections/objects/11153.html\">the Observatory\u2019s chief instrument</a>, that marked the centre of time and longitude measurement (even if they used a series of threads rather than a single central one). It is, apparently, always the silk of the larger females that humans use. It seems apt, since the virtue of patience and skills of spinning and weaving are also typically associated with the feminine. Thus Morgan touches on Ovid\u2019s story of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arachne\">Arachne</a> and tells us about the women who contributed to America\u2019s war effort by tickling and coaxing spiders to produce sufficient threads for the nation\u2019s guns and sights. </p> <p>But, while these feminine connections are, like the threads, drawn out, there are many male ones too. These include instruments with vibrating <a href=\"http://objects.prm.ox.ac.uk/pages/PRMUID20013.html\">membranes made of spider egg cases</a> used by Bemba men to <a href=\"http://objects.prm.ox.ac.uk/pages/PRMUID20898.html\">make animal-like sounds</a> for hunting, or in Nigeria <a href=\"http://objects.prm.ox.ac.uk/pages/PRMUID18285.html\">to disguise voices</a> when seeking connection with the spirit world. Spider silk cloth headdresses were used in male-only ceremonies in Vanuatu, which survive as fascinating, if usually mislabelled, objects in <a href=\"http://objects.prm.ox.ac.uk/pages/PRMUID47085.html\">several</a> <a href=\"http://collectionsonline.nmsi.ac.uk/detail.php?t=objects&amp;type=all&amp;f=&amp;s=spider+cloth&amp;record=0\">British</a> <a href=\"http://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/collection_object_details.aspx?objectId=495766&amp;partId=1&amp;material=17738&amp;page=1\">museums</a>. </p> <p>Both men and women were involved in the quest to profit from spider silk. Satirised by Jonathan Swift in Gulliver\u2019s Travels, many nevertheless hoped to challenge the silkworm industry with spiders, knitting spider-silk stockings for scientific academies and monarchs or patenting machines to pin down spiders and reel out their silk. As Morgan writes, the story is \u201cfull of such moments of enthusiastic confidence at the industrial potential of these animals, followed by despair when faced with the difficulty of dealing with the spiders themselves.\u201d Quickly we find ourselves back in the realm of myths and fairy tales: dresses that are so fine they might be kept in a nutshell, or the more-than-gossamer-fine emperor\u2019s new clothes.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f8eec0c97a7276a5a453a93762c0118ceba2851b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f8eec0c97a7276a5a453a93762c0118ceba2851b/0_157_1596_958/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Spider silking machine by Termeyer\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Illustration of a spider silking machine invented, but never used, by Abb\u00e9 Ramon de Termeyer in the 18th century.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Eleanor Morgan</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Yet, looking at images of reeled silk of the Madagascan <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephila_clavipes\"><em>Nephila clavipes</em></a>, you can see why they persisted. It is a glorious and lustrous gold. Despite what you hear about the amazing properties of spider silk, I had not quite realised that it might be washed, boiled, carded, spun, woven and preserved. I saw the spider silk cape discussed in the book (below) at the V&amp;A in 2012, but somehow had not really believed what it was, nor realised this was the silk\u2019s natural colour. Made in Madagascar by Simon Peers, Nicholas Godley and a team of spider collectors, silkers, weavers and over a million strapped-down spiders, it took eight years to make. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"eae16b4783776d9f2b5a7b694154639b5344f482\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/eae16b4783776d9f2b5a7b694154639b5344f482/0_0_5504_3744/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Golden Spider Silk Cape, by Simon Peers and Nicholas Godley, modelled by Bianca at the V&amp;A in 2012.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"680\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Golden Spider Silk Cape, by Simon Peers and Nicholas Godley, modelled by Bianca at the V&amp;A in 2012.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Levene/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In looking for the answer to the question of producing spider silk in sufficient quantities, we have lately turned to genetically modified <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2000/may/20/martinkettle\">spider-goats</a> \u2013 no less fantastical but certainly real. Nevertheless, despite the fact that these goats can be milked (or silked?) for the right proteins, no one has yet produced from this a material that can match the strength and elasticity of the real thing. </p> <p>Framing the book is Morgan\u2019s own developing interest in the material and its makers. We learn of her attempts to collect spider silk and to understand its role for spiders and humans alike - you can <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p0469pzx\">hear her talking about this</a> on Radio 4\u2019s Natural Histories. She writes that \u201cI am drawn to spiders because, like me, they make things\u201d, and this is at the heart of her personal quest. She insists on the material and embodied nature of the things we make, even in our imaginations.</p> <p>\u201cThe trouble with working with threads is that they can connect to anything\u201d, Morgan says, but she knows that this is the joy of the book. Although some connections seem more obvious or enticing than others, the book\u2019s range is impressive and handled confidently. If I had some tiny niggles with parts that fell into my area of expertise, I nevertheless enjoyed the way this story was linked into the others, which were nearly all new to me. It is a book to enjoy and to get you thinking about the skills and manufactured worlds of both humans and animals.</p> <p><em>Eleanor Morgan\u2019s</em> Gossamer Days: Spiders, Humans and their Threads<em> is published by Stranger Attractor Press.

  "<p>Esteban Gir\u00f3n, an organiser with the <a href=\"http://www.crownheightstenantunion.org/\">Crown Heights Tenant Union</a>, is sitting in a Dunkin Donuts on Eastern Parkway in Brooklyn just before closing time. Employees mop the floors, look at the clock and try not to glare.</p> <p>At this time of day, there are two nearby bars he could have been hanging out at instead \u2013 shabby-chic fascimiles of industrial-town dives, except for the $8 beers \u2013 but he and his husband won\u2019t go in them. In fact, he has already told one of the bar owners that he\u2019s planning a protest with his neighbours against them.</p> <p>Like the rest of the tenant union organisers, Gir\u00f3n volunteers his time to help this three-year-old group fight to keep long-time tenants in their homes. It\u2019s a deceptively simple assignment \u2013 but here, in Crown Heights, it might just be the key to stopping yet another episode in New York\u2019s ongoing history of social cleansing.</p> <p>\u201cAll the other organising strategies have been tried in Bushwick,\u201d Gir\u00f3n says. \u201cThey basically pit the landlord against the tenant against the quote-unquote gentrifiers. And when you do that, you\u2019re not going to win anything.\u201d</p> <p>Indeed, in the great war against gentrification throughout New York City, most of the battles have been losses. The formerly low-income and heavily minority neighbourhoods of Williamsburg, Bushwick and Bedford-Stuyvesant have already, for all intents and purposes, heavily gentrified.</p> <p>Next in the crosshairs is Crown Heights, which used to be almost exclusively peopled by African Americans and Hasidic Jews. It is now the last line of defence for \u2018affordable\u2019 Brooklyn, where, <a href=\"http://www.realtytrac.com/news/company-news/q3-2016-home-affordability-index/\">according to a new report</a>, the average resident must now spend 124% of their wages to meet the monthly payments on a median-priced home \u2013 the highest figure in the the country.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/19/brooklyn-gentrification-crown-heights-bedford-union-armory\">Brooklyn lawmakers enter gentrification feud over Crown Heights neighborhood</a> </p> </aside>  <p>A quarter of a century ago in 1991, this neighbourhood was the <a href=\"http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/brooklyn/crown-heights-erupts-days-race-riots-1991-article-1.2750050\">the site of riots</a> after a Jewish man killed a black seven-year-old in a grisly car accident.

There are two keys: building community, then educating tenants about their rights and how to enforce them. </p> <p>Twice a week, Gir\u00f3n accompanies tenants to housing court, to prevent intimidation and show landlords the CHTU is firmly on the tenants\u2019 side. He also helps tenants figure out who actually owns their buildings: some landlords attempt to obscure their involvement to avoid bad publicity about their tactics or housing conditions.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"4d9ddfb78f3201f6f97069629ee277f90c807153\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4d9ddfb78f3201f6f97069629ee277f90c807153/0_134_4500_2700/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A defaced poster showing an impending Crown Heights development\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A defaced poster showing an impending Crown Heights development</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tim Knox/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>What Crown Heights has learned from other neighbourhoods is that while big fights might seem unwinnable, small victories can lead to bigger ones. For example, one hold-out tenant can be enough to prevent a developer from buying a building; keeping tenants in place can disrupt the whole cycle of gentrification. </p> <p>One example of this is sitting across the table from us: Marcia Louisy. Gir\u00f3n says: \u201cThe only way to put a pause on this [gentrification] is when the Marcias of the world hold it down.\u201d</p> <p>Louisy is a transplant from Jamaica. Eighteen years ago, she moved into a rent-controlled, three-bedroom apartment in Crown Heights. She pays roughly $1,000 a month; the neighbours upstairs pay $4,500. Her apartment could clearly fetch thousands more on the open market, and her landlord has already offered her $250,000 to move.</p> <p>That sounds like a lot of money, but it would be <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/21/realestate/rent-stabilized-apartments-buyouts-application-fees.html?_r=0\">subject to significant taxes</a>, and probably wouldn\u2019t even buy her a small condominium further out in the borough. She\u2019s holding out, and not just because of the money. \u201cThat\u2019s my apartment,\u201d she says. \u201cMy kids were born in that apartment, they\u2019ve grown up in that apartment.\u201d</p> <p>According to Gir\u00f3n, many tenants in the area are harassed and intimidated into taking buyouts, or driven out by crumbling apartments and a lack of repairs. The goal is the same: get rid of rent-controlled tenants with, in many cases, generational rights to remain.</p> <h2>Total disrespect</h2> <p>Vaughn Armour, a 17-year resident of Crown Heights, is also facing down a landlord trying to buy him out. His long-time girlfriend, Barbara Simmons, who lived in the same apartment for 42 years, passed away over Labor Day weekend. Before her memorial service, the landlord went to the apartment to encourage Armour and Simmons\u2019 son to leave.</p> <p>\u201cShe\u2019s not even buried yet, and [the landlord] had the audacity to offer my stepson $5,000 for the apartment,\u201d Armour says. \u201cThat is total disrespect.</p> <p>\u201cHe don\u2019t realise that I\u2019m a member of New York Communities for Change, and I know when it comes to written laws and guidelines that I don\u2019t have to go nowhere. We have succession rights. I\u2019ve been there for 17 years, a New York state-recognised common-law husband, and her son\u2019s been there for 33 years. The only thing this guy can do is give us the succession papers to sign, and a new lease.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"8bd6385371de74041e26ae112b622e28764ac485\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8bd6385371de74041e26ae112b622e28764ac485/0_109_4500_2700/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Vaughn Armour, a Crown Heights resident of 17 years.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Vaughn Armour, a Crown Heights resident of 17 years, is facing down the landlord who wants to buy him out.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tim Knox/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><a href=\"http://nycommunities.org/\">New York Communities for Change</a> is another of the groups in Brooklyn fighting to help low- and moderate-income tenants stay in their homes. Like the CHTU, they educate tenants about their rights, advocate for laws that help tenants, and try to help people have a voice in the myriad approval processes that govern development in the city. Armour says the brush with his landlord has spurred him to further action with NYCC.</p> <p>\u201cWe need to get out and start talking to tenants in the buildings, and tell them: \u2018As long as you\u2019re paying your rent and you\u2019re not destroying their property or being a nuisance to other neighbours, you shouldn\u2019t be harassed,\u2019\u201d he says. \u201cIt works, too.\u201d</p> <p>Helping renters stay in their homes, though, is only half the gentrification fight. Developers are also tearing down old buildings to erect luxury apartments that few locals could afford, in a city where rents have risen twice as fast as incomes.</p> <p>As Armour puts it: \u201cDevelopers shouldn\u2019t be able to come in and build something that no one who lives here can afford.\u201d</p> <p>New buildings in neighbourhoods like Crown Heights must usually set aside a certain number of \u2018affordable\u2019 units, although many people can\u2019t afford even those. \u201cEspecially around this area \u2013 Lefferts, Albany, Kingston \u2013 the average salary per year is $23,000,\u201d says Armour, adding that the \u2018affordable housing\u2019 in some of the new apartment buildings doesn\u2019t reflect that. \u201cFamily of four, $31,000 and up.

Because much of New York\u2019s residential zones are already built on, developers look for small buildings they can tear down \u2013 which is difficult if a neighbourhood has landmark status, and nearly impossible if a specific building does.</p> <p>Could it work in Crown Heights?

They produced four designs for the US firm, and it began a journey that has defined the rest of their lives.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b1aab1148c342135eb9850bdd2648fea1a5478a2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b1aab1148c342135eb9850bdd2648fea1a5478a2/0_0_3020_2415/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Counting Pane: a grid of the numbers from 1 to 100.

Bags for life and, in particular, cotton bags require much more energy \u2013 and carbon emissions \u2013 to produce. <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/life-cycle-assessment-of-supermarket-carrierbags-a-review-of-the-bags-available-in-2006\" title=\"\">A study by the Environment Agency</a> found a \u201cresource expenditure\u201d of just 2kg of carbon per plastic bag: a paper bag would need to be used seven times to achieve the same per-use expenditure; a cotton bag would need to be used 327 times.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.supreme-creations.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Supreme Creations</a>, which claims to be the world\u2019s largest ethical packaging company, reports a 20% increase in sales of its <a href=\"http://bagsofethics.org/\" title=\"\">reusable carrier bags</a> since the levy was introduced in England. So, are we now creating reusable bag mountains? My family\u2019s reusable bag stash currently stands at 15, but these include a cotton bag from the Devon town of Modbury, which I picked up in 2007 when I wrote about it being <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2007/may/12/uknews.waste\" title=\"\">the first place in Europe to ban plastic bags</a>. That has definitely had more than 300 uses, and so have our three large Ikea bags, which I take to the supermarket each week.</p> <p>Surfers Against Sewage, Keep Britain Tidy and the Marine Conservation Society all say that there are no problems with reusable bags being littered on land or sea. \u201cBecause people pay for them, they value them and there is no tossing them away,\u201d says Foster. What about the free ones? \u201cEven if you get them for free, you hoard them,\u201d says Cummins. \u201cYou need every bag you can get if your shopping is anything like mine.\u201d</p> <p>For analysts such as David Powell of the <a href=\"http://www.neweconomics.org/people/entry/david-powell\" title=\"\">New Economics Foundation</a>, the unequivocal success of the plastic bag charge shows that the government shouldn\u2019t be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2015/sep/12/nudge-theory-mental-manipulation-wrong\" title=\"\">afraid of using financial \u201cnudges\u201d</a> in new environmental regulations. Who would imagine that a 5p charge changes human behaviour so decisively?</p> <p>\u201cBy far the most interesting thing about the plastic bag charge is just how successful an incredibly small charge can be,\u201d says Powell. \u201cIntroduce the right charge in the right way and people respond to it, particularly if there\u2019s such an obvious environmental problem. The government will have to conclude, how can we use this principle for other things?\u201d</p> <p>The Cardiff University survey also reveals that the charge has made people in England more willing to accept regulations to reduce plastic waste, such as a 5p charge on plastic bottles. Plastic bags may have been litter\u2019s poster child, but they amounted to just 2% of beach rubbish. Powell suggests a charge on coffee cups is an obvious next step. \u201cThere are massive piles of unrecycled coffee cups everywhere. It\u2019s an obvious problem that people are keen to do something about.\u201d</p> <p>While the plastic-bag charge was about changing consumer behaviour, announcing a charge on coffee cups to apply at a future date would give the industry an incentive to innovate and find alternatives, rather like the sugar tax, which will apply from 2017.</p> <p>Both Keep Britain Tidy and Surfers Against Sewage would like to see the government close the loopholes in England\u2019s current plastic bag charge so that paper bags incur a charge, too, and small shops are no longer exempt (the Association of Convenience Stores wanted to be included in the charging system from the outset). However, a Defra spokesperson says there are currently no plans to extend the regulations.</p> <p>\u201cWe walk into meetings with Defra where the position is: \u2018The government doesn\u2019t want new regulations.\u2019 Unfortunately, that\u2019s the default position,\u201d says Cummins. He thinks the next example of a win-win regulation that would benefit consumers, industry and the environment is <a href=\"http://messageinabottle.org.uk/\" title=\"\">a deposit-return system</a> for drinks bottles. Such systems are used in dozens of European countries from Germany to Croatia, and in Australian and American states, too.</p> <p>Reverse vending machines that give people, say, 20p for their plastic and glass bottles and aluminium cans deliver recycling rates of up to 90%, provide high-grade recyclable materials for industry, and save councils\u2019 doorstep recycling and rubbish bin costs, argues Cummins. If placed on shop floors, they also encourage footfall; it\u2019s not hard to imagine kids collecting bottles and quickly spending their earnings in the shops.</p> <p>\u201cWe all know that litter breeds litter,\u201d says Cummins. \u201cIf you can take these really visible litter items out of the environment with a successful deposit-return system, it will have a knock-on effect and everyone will treat their environment better.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>I found out my mum was dying four days before she passed away, and she wasn\u2019t even the one who told me, it was my godfather. I had known she was unwell for some time, but her death still came as a shock. The last couple of days were very painful.</p> <p>My issues with food started before her cancer diagnosis. At 12, I started to think I was fat. I have always been insecure about the way I look, so I went on a diet and it spiralled out of control. When I found out my mum was ill, everything got worse. I was eventually referred to children\u2019s mental health services because I was so unwell. My life was so out of control that food, the one thing I thought I could control, became my obsession.</p> <p>By the time my mum passed away, two years later, I was managing my eating disorder but not fully recovered. I was still very controlling about what I ate and worried about putting on weight. My family situation was getting more complicated: I had a difficult relationship with my dad and my grandfather suffered from Alzheimer\u2019s, so I ended up in foster care.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/oct/03/quarter-of-a-million-children-receiving-mental-health-care-in-england\">Quarter of a million children receiving mental health care in England</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The next few years involved seeing various therapists and moving to different foster families. At 16, when I was sitting my GCSEs I reached my lowest point. As I was walking in to take one of my exams I felt exhausted, cold and tired. My anorexia was the worst it had ever been and I didn\u2019t want to be alive anymore. My latest foster placement wasn\u2019t working out. I felt lost and alone, walking around in a blur. Shortly after this, I was sectioned. Those around me were worried I might kill myself. I ended up being taken into hospital to be looked after.</p> <p>Sometimes in life you just crack, you cannot really explain it. I cracked and thought, \u201cI cannot do this anymore.\u201d I didn\u2019t know who I was or what I was doing and I was still struggling to come to terms with my mum\u2019s death.</p> <p>It feels strange to look back at this time because now \u2013 as a 20-year-old woman \u2013 I am well on the path to recovery. Today, I am happy, with an amazing foster mother and about to embark on a trip to India to learn yoga. I\u2019ve turned my life around, although it hasn\u2019t been easy.</p> <p>My journey to recovery was not plain sailing. I spent a year in a hospital ward, and it got to the point where I was afraid to leave, because being in hospital changed me. The thought of having to stay overnight in a hospital now terrifies me, but there was a point where, for me, it was the norm.</p> <p>It was while I was in hospital, aged 16, that I met the woman who changed my life: my foster mum. She gave me hope and made me feel loved. At first, I was cautious because of past relationships, but gradually she helped lift me out of my depression and offered me a new life with her. </p> <p>I remember we had this really awkward tour around the unit when she first arrived and the nurses were like, \u201cIt\u2019s so nice to meet you.\u201d The moment I thought she might be the right person for me was when I was flicking through this Cath Kidston magazine and saw a bag I wanted. The next day she bought it for me and I was so surprised. I suddenly felt that someone had noticed me.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/oct/03/help-for-childrens-mental-health-from-apps-to-parenting-classes\">Help for children's mental health, from apps to parenting classes</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The turning point that finally got me out of hospital was when I wanted to go to a vegan Buddhist camp with her and her family. Me and my foster mum are both very stubborn and we were like, \u201cLet\u2019s do this.\u201d I got discharged three days before the holiday and never went back. It was a lightbulb moment, and I didn\u2019t want to fall further behind in school. After this, I joined college and started my new life in London. <br></p> <p>My foster mum is so supportive. She used to sit with me all the time when I ate, even if I took an hour to get through a single yoghurt. She was patient and kind. She never seemed annoyed at me and took me on at difficult time in my life. She also gave me the best advice, telling me that everything passes and a lot of the time we feel bad but then that goes, life is about change and nothing lasts for ever. </p> <p>She made me realise that people are scared of change because it feels wrong, but if recovery feels wrong then that\u2019s exciting. It\u2019s hard being ill but it\u2019s also hard taking those first steps to recovery, although it\u2019s so worth it.</p> <p>Having an eating disorder is like being stuck in a box and you know others have left the box before, but you\u2019re not sure how you are going to do it. You hate being in the box, but the outside world also seems scary, so you are sat there looking out through the keyhole thinking, \u201cHow do I get out?\u201d I was feeling very suicidal, which was part of the reason why I didn\u2019t eat. My depression led to my anorexia, which was never really about the food at all.</p> <p>I believe everyone can get through an eating disorder. My experiences have taught me to be more comfortable about being vulnerable. Strength is accepting we are human and bad times and good times all pass. Life has its ups and downs but you must be brave enough to keep going. Real strength is admitting you are vulnerable, and, if you need help, please go and get it. </p> <p><em>The Beat youthline can help young people experiencing an eating disorder: <a href=\"https://www.b-eat.co.uk/support-services/helpline\">0345 634 7650.</a> In the UK, the Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123.

  "<p>The organisers of a homelessness protest, in which around 50 rough sleepers have pitched tents in Leeds city centre, are due to appear in court to fight a bid to disperse them.</p> <p>The \u201ctent city\u201d was set up on 21 September to protest against a perceived lack of action by the council to tackle homelessness in Leeds.</p> <p>Leeds Homeless Action Group has called on the council to provide rough sleepers with a safe space to sleep, but the council has argued there is accommodation available for every person sleeping on the streets if they want it. </p> <p>Continuously staffed by volunteers, who distribute donated clothing, food and hot drinks to homeless people sleeping in the tents, the project was first pitched outside the city\u2019s art gallery before it was ordered to move last week to make way for Yorkshire\u2019s Olympics celebrations. </p> <p>Now on its second site in Park Square, which is home to many of the city\u2019s law firms, the protest faces having to move again as the council has issued a claim for possession of the square. The council is also asking for an injunction to stop the organisers setting up the project at other sites across the city centre. The case will be heard at Leeds county court on Monday.</p> <p>Haydn Jessop, one of the protest\u2019s organisers, said that gathering lots of the city\u2019s rough sleepers in one place gives them \u201ca bigger voice\u201d. \u201cWhen you get off the bus in the morning to go to work you might see one or two rough sleepers, but the total number of rough sleepers doesn\u2019t go into people\u2019s minds,\u201d he said. </p> <p>He argued that bringing rough sleepers together makes the scale of the problem clear. \u201cAnd we\u2019re only touching the iceberg with this,\u201d said Jessop. \u201cThere are hundreds in Leeds, all in different areas.\u201d</p> <p>Leeds\u2019s tent city is one of many such communities of homeless people to emerge in towns across the country, inspired by similar projects in Manchester, Nottingham and Bristol. Many of the tents and sleeping bags were salvaged after being abandoned at Leeds festival this summer.</p> <p>Jessop, who was once homeless himself, wants the council to provide a permanent, secure space for the project. He said police told the group privately that crime has fallen in the area since the start of the protest because the rough sleepers are being properly provided for.</p> <p>Michael Eric Bleasby, who has been homeless for four years and has been sleeping at the tent city since it started, said he has witnessed provision for homeless people decline in the city. \u201cI used to walk around Leeds and there used to be loads of hostels, but all the hostels have shut down. They\u2019ve all been turned into studio flats for the students and I don\u2019t recognise it anymore,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Helen Hayton, a volunteer with the project, said rough sleepers live in constant fear of being beaten up, but that the tent city provides a safe environment. When she was volunteering at the protest\u2019s last site late at night, she had to stop people urinating on the tents in which people were sleeping. \u201c[The rough sleepers] are looking a lot more well because they\u2019re getting a proper night\u2019s sleep now,\u201d she said.</p> <p>A statement on behalf of Leeds city council, West Yorkshire police and Leeds BID (business improvement district) said helping the homeless remained an absolute priority for them. \u201cThere is a strong collaborative approach with businesses and third sector organisations to offer access to a wide range of support services and a bed for the night to ensure that no one has to sleep on the streets,\u201d they said.<br>  \u201cWe have asked the Leeds Homeless Action Group to become part of this collaborative approach so they can make a positive contribution and work on practical solutions to help those in genuine need. This offer still stands despite the fact that the Leeds Homeless Action Group is not an official or registered homeless support group or charitable organisation.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/30/posters-berating-homeless-beggars-as-tricksters-not-true\">Posters berating homeless beggars as frauds?

These issues are extremely complex, and the circumstances of beggars, rough sleepers and the homeless are not always interlinked or the same.  \u201cAccommodation is available in the city and offers are made to rough sleepers on a daily basis but for a variety of complex reasons some will refuse a place to stay,\u201d they said.   \u201cAs well as working with rough sleepers, the council and partners work with homeless people and people who beg on a daily basis to provide much needed support. Offers of accommodation will always be made to anyone who is without accommodation and if we are contacted or made aware of an individuals\u2019 situation. </p> <p>\u201cWhile the issue of accommodation is extremely important, this does distract sometimes from other complex issues such as how we can engage people often with complex mental health needs and addictions in the support that is available.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 3 October 2016.

  "<p>The second of Apple\u2019s newest smartphones, the iPhone 7 Plus, is bigger, more expensive, has a few more features and actually lasts a day per charge. But is it worth buying over its rivals?<br></p> <p>The largest in Apple\u2019s smartphone range has always felt like it played second fiddle to the darling of the Apple\u2019s eye, the regular iPhone. Two years since the launch of the iPhone 6 Plus, however, the iPhone 7 Plus (<a href=\"http://go.theguardian.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.johnlewis.com%2Fbrand%2Fapple%2Fiphone-7-plus%2F_%2FN-1z13zz4Z1z07s5g&amp;id=114047X1572903\">find here</a>) has a new dual camera, longer battery life and more power, which make it feel like Apple\u2019s paying it a bit more attention.</p> <h2>Remember 2014?</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bf2bf2248a52b9bb2f022bcdd9f8dd5ee8fa269e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bf2bf2248a52b9bb2f022bcdd9f8dd5ee8fa269e/0_0_4080_2448/1000.jpg\" alt=\"iphone 7 plus review\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The back of the iPhone 7 Plus is plain with plastic edges now that the antenna bands skirt its edges.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Like with the iPhone 7, one place where Apple hasn\u2019t made a lot of changes is to the design. Side-by-side with either the iPhone 6 Plus or <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/oct/02/iphone-6s-plus-review-barely-better\">iPhone 6S Plus</a>, you\u2019d be hard pressed to tell them apart. There\u2019s no headphone socket in the bottom, of course, and the antenna lines are a little less obvious, at least on the black version, but there\u2019s still an ugly camera lump on the back, and that is even larger now. The back also looks a bit plainer and somehow cheaper with the top and bottom plastic edges created by the antenna bands.</p> <p>The industrial design of the smartphone is now two years old, and it shows. The 5.5in 1080p screen is arguably the best LCD ever fitted to an iPhone - crisp, bright and colourful - but it has the same large bezels either side that the original iPhone 6 Plus had from 2014.</p> <p>In two years things have moved on. The iPhone 7 Plus is now a very large device despite the screen being one of the smallest for a phablet. Compared to rivals with the same 5.5in screen the iPhone 7 Plus is 77.9mm wide, which is 3.2mm wider than the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/jun/14/oneplus-3-review-flagship-phone-at-mid-range-price\">OnePlus 3</a> and 5.3mm wider than the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/mar/11/samsung-galaxy-s7-edge-review-android-smartphone-phablet-marshmallow\">Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge</a>. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/aug/25/samsung-galaxy-note-7-review-the-king-of-the-phablets-returns\">Samsung Galaxy Note 7</a>, which has a larger 5.7in screen, is still 4mm narrower than the iPhone.</p> <p>Why does width matter? The wider the device the harder it is to hold with one hand. No matter how much you might consider a phablet a two-hand device, at some point you will have to use it with one hand and that\u2019s when people tend to drop their smartphones. At 77.9mm wide, with smooth rounded sides that feel nice but are slippery to try and grip, the iPhone 7 Plus is simply too wide for me to manage with a \u2013 not abnormal \u2013 hand span of 23cm.</p> <p>That was the case for almost all phablets two years ago, but in 2016 you can have both a 5.5in or larger screen and make it manageable with one hand.

It dropped about 5% in eight hours overnight with do not disturb mode active.</p> <p>That kind of battery life means that you can be confident it will get you home after a night out. You will have to charge it each night, but unless you\u2019re shooting 4K videos all the time, not during the day.</p> <p>Which is a good thing, because fully charging the iPhone 7 Plus takes ages.

It is fast and accurate, although not quite the best in the industry. The home button is no longer a physical button, however.</p> <p>It\u2019s been replaced by a pressure sensitive pad. Pushing it activates the taptic engine, giving a little vibration that feels like the whole bottom half of the phone depresses like a big mouse button. Some will love it, some will hate it; I quite like it.</p> <p>The taptic engine is one of the best features of the iPhone. With short sharp clicks, taps and vibrations for notifications and general feedback, it is genuinely the best thing Apple has created in years.</p> <h2>Dual Camera</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"73295844edb5790be82bdf6edd21799a25006469\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/73295844edb5790be82bdf6edd21799a25006469/0_0_4096_2458/1000.jpg\" alt=\"iphone 7 plus review\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The dual camera sticks out of the back with what look like robot\u2019s eyes in certain lighting conditions.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Apple has jumped on the dual-camera bandwagon, following LG and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/jun/07/huawei-p9-plus-review-high-class-phablet-sub-par-software\">Huawei</a>. Apple\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/may/11/lg-g5-review-power-users-friend-that-just-misses-mark\">approach is similar to LG</a>\u2019s: one camera has a standard wide-angle f/1.8 lens the same as fitted to the iPhone 7, the other has a slower f/2.8 lens with an effective two-times magnification compared to the standard lens.</p> <p>It gives the iPhone a 2x optical zoom and up to 10x digital zoom, which is a mixed bag. Images captured with the standard camera, which has optical image stabilisation, are crisp, detailed and colourful, even in low-light conditions. They are the same as those captured by the iPhone 7 and are a big step up in quality and performance in my testing compared to the iPhone 6S Plus. For comparison, the Samsung Galaxy S7, S7 Edge and Note 7 have cameras with f/1.7 lenses.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"36796f29140ed8cdad988fd9e591f3e368fbef0c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/36796f29140ed8cdad988fd9e591f3e368fbef0c/0_0_4510_2706/1000.jpg\" alt=\"iphone 7 plus review\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The secondary camera on the back magnifies the image by two times.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The other 2x camera, however, doesn\u2019t perform nearly as well. In good outdoor lighting you can get some great shots. Poor outdoor lighting they\u2019re not quite as good as the standard camera, but still decent. The problem comes when you\u2019re shooting in average indoor lighting conditions, where the 2x camera falls down. It doesn\u2019t have optical image stabilisation and isn\u2019t anywhere near as good at letting light in, meaning images are often grainy and lacking in detail.</p> <p>To the user, however, the two cameras are essentially one. The iPhone 7 Plus\u2019s software blends the two images together from the two cameras, so you can slide your finger and zoom in fluid increments all the way to 10x magnification. It\u2019s a shame, then, that Apple hasn\u2019t chosen to offer a light information boosting system like <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/jun/07/huawei-p9-plus-review-high-class-phablet-sub-par-software\">Huawei\u2019s on the P9 Plus</a>, which uses the other camera to increase the amount of light information available, and therefore the detail and brightness of images taken in poor lighting conditions.</p> <p>The 2x magnification proved more useful than I was expecting, but the digital zoom is still not worth using, particularly at its extremes \u2013 it\u2019s simply artificially spreading the pixels out without adding new information, and the resulting photos look awful.</p> <p>The 7-megapixel selfie camera is one of the best in the business, creating detail rich and colour accurate photos even under difficult artificial lightning conditions.</p> <h2>Where do I stick my headphone jack?</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0ad6eb9ed12118f56946a33ea61827142d0fc9fc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0ad6eb9ed12118f56946a33ea61827142d0fc9fc/0_0_2574_1545/1000.jpg\" alt=\"iphone 7 plus review\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">No headphone port means it\u2019s Lightning, Bluetooth or bust.

  "<p>Two years ago, I <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/oct/14/age-of-loneliness-killing-us\">wrote a column</a> for the Guardian in which I argued that what distinguishes our age from those preceding it is an epidemic of loneliness. Throughout human history, we have been hypersocial animals, dependent on each other for both physical and psychic survival. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/belief/2009/apr/03/religion-philosophy-hobbes-midgley\">Thomas Hobbes</a>\u2019s claim \u2013 that our natural state is a war of \u201cevery man against every man\u201d \u2013 is a myth proposed by someone whose understanding of human evolution was confined to the book of Genesis. But the myth is now being realised through the religion of our time: a celebration of extreme individualism and universal competition. The resulting loneliness, I argued, is a deadly condition, which kills as many people as smoking or obesity.</p> <p> To my astonishment, the article exploded, and the ripples can still be felt today. <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b06vkhr5\">A documentary it inspired</a>, called The Age of Loneliness, aired recently on BBC1. Several publishers asked me to write books on the topic, but I could think of nothing more depressing than spending three years sitting on my backside, documenting social isolation. There was plenty I wanted to say on the topic. But how?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"834c22e410bcf68e056e736c0d5dac7ec952fa1b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/834c22e410bcf68e056e736c0d5dac7ec952fa1b/0_0_1647_1482/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Breaking the Spell of Loneliness\" width=\"1000\" height=\"900\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The album: Breaking the Spell of Loneliness</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR Company Handout</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>A few weeks later, I dashed out to buy some screws from a hardware shop. Ahead of me in the queue was an elderly woman. She lent on the counter, dithering about what she wanted and trying to engage the sales assistants in a riveting conversation about her state of health. Stuck behind her, I quietly fumed: it seemed as if she would never leave.<br></p> <p>But as I cycled home, and my frustration ebbed away, I saw what should have been obvious: here was a person who seemed desperately lonely. \u201cWhere\u2019s your empathy?\u201d I asked myself. \u201cIsn\u2019t that what you were writing about?\u201d What if that conversation was the only one she would have all day? I felt guilty about my feelings in the shop.</p> <p>When I returned to my desk, I began dashing out a rough poem about a woman with little to keep her company but memories, who goes to the shops in the hope that she might talk to someone, but discovers that the tills have been replaced with automatic checkouts. As I wrote, it seemed to me that it was trying to become something else: a ballad. Suddenly I knew what I wanted to do: I wanted to write an album.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"George Monbiot and Ewan McLennan talk about their new album Breaking the Spell of Loneliness\">  <iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/284111617&amp;color=ff5500&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false\"></iframe> <figcaption><a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/theguardianmusic/george-monbiot-and-ewan-mclennan-on-breaking-the-spell-of-loneliness\">George Monbiot and Ewan McLennan talk about their new album Breaking the Spell of Loneliness</a></figcaption> </figure>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Weeks after I  emailed my first song sketch to Ewan, I found an audio file in my inbox \u2026 I was like a child at Christmas</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>There were just a couple of minor hitches. I can\u2019t read music, I don\u2019t play an instrument and my singing is banned under international law. But I knew who to ask. I first heard <a href=\"http://www.ewanmclennan.co.uk/\">Ewan McLennan</a> while listening to <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b0112fz1\">Late Junction</a> on Radio 3, in 2011. I was transfixed by his voice, his playing and what seemed to be an almost supernatural ability to find the heart of a song. He was just 25. </p> <p>I bought his first album, Rags and Robes, and listened to it over and again. Three years later, I heard him <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p02b2ppt\">interviewed by Mary Ann Kennedy</a>, whose programmes I\u2019ve followed since she began broadcasting on Radio Scotland. He was relaxed and funny, politically engaged and plainly fascinated by the roots and text of songs and poems.</p> <p>I did something I have seldom done: I sent him a fan letter. I invited him to a talk I was giving in his home city, Bristol. He came and over dinner afterwards, we clicked. So, a few months later, with some trepidation, it was to him that I sent my idea of collaborating on a themed album.</p> <p>To my delight, he agreed. I would start by thinking up a story and writing a rough sketch, which might incorporate some potential hooks, rhymes and choruses. I would send it to him on the understanding that he could do whatever he liked with it. I did not try to write to his style, as I knew he would take what he wanted and make the song his own.<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Age of Loneliness documentary\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;iframe frameborder=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot; height=&quot;270&quot; src=&quot;//www.dailymotion.com/embed/video/x3lfsw3&quot; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x3lfsw3_documentary-age-of-loneliness_tv&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Documentary - Age of loneliness&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>I wasn\u2019t wrong. A couple of weeks after I emailed the first sketch to him, I found an audio file in my inbox, and opened it with the excitement of a child at Christmas. It was wonderful \u2013 he had turned my base metal into gold. The songs he sent back to me were heart-wrenching, capturing sensations I have long struggled to express.<br></p> <p>The album is a mixture of dark shades and light: sad ballads and stirring anthems. We want to use it as a means of not only talking about loneliness, but, in a small way, addressing it. With advice from charities working on the issue, we are designing our gigs to try to bring people together. I will talk about the themes and Ewan will perform the songs. We will encourage people in the audience to talk to each other, then it will end up with a party in the nearest willing pub. Music naturally makes connections \u2013 we want to take it a step further.<br></p> <p>In one respect, the album is already succeeding, as the collaboration has relieved the usual solitude in which we both work, making our lives less lonely. I hope it has the same effect on other people.</p> <ul> <li><a href=\"http://www.fellside.com/shop/fe-cd/ewan-mclennan-george-monbiot-breaking-spell-loneliness/\">Breaking the Spell of Loneliness is released on 14 October by Fellside Records</a>.

  "<p>When Dirk M\u00fcrlebach moved from Margate in Kent to Poplar in London he got an unwelcome surprise. On his arrival in the capital, he was told that his car insurance premium was rising from \u00a3435 to almost \u00a32,000. \u201cI thought \u2018right, I\u2019m getting rid of the car\u2019,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Instead of spending his days navigating public transport in the absence of his own vehicle, M\u00fcrlebach signed up for the same service that a growing number of British drivers are using \u2013 car clubs, where you can pay to drive by the hour.</p> <p>While the number of cars on UK roads is up by almost 20% since the turn of the millennium, there is also an increasing appetite for more flexible car use. Nearly 250,000 people are members of car clubs using some 4,000 vehicles, according to <a href=\"http://www.carplus.org.uk/\">Carplus</a>, a group which promotes the use of shared transport.</p> <p>The concept is straightforward: typically, users join a club, pay a monthly fee, and then pay by the hour to use the vehicles which are parked in various locations and can be collected and returned as and when required. In turn, the obligations associated with buying and running a car \u2013 tax, insurance, maintenance \u2013 are avoided.</p> <p>M\u00fcrlebach, who signed up to <a href=\"https://ecarclub.co.uk/\">E-Car</a>, which specialises in electric vehicles, runs an art gallery and hires a Renault Kangoo mid-size van to transport paintings, a Nissan Leaf to pick up his children when they fly into Stansted airport, or the smaller Renault Zoe for everyday errands such as shopping. The club charges a one-off \u00a350 membership fee and he pays an optional \u00a315 monthly charge for reduced hire rates. \u201cI pay just \u00a35.50 an hour for a Nissan Leaf or \u00a36.50 for the Renault Kangoo, and that\u2019s it. No insurance, breakdown cover, maintenance, cleaning, tax, parking permits or congestion charge,\u201d M\u00fcrlebach said. \u201cWe spend on average around \u00a350 a month. Previously, when we owned a car, the average cost was around \u00a3300 a month.\u201d</p> <p>Most of the wave of car clubs are based in London, although bigger cities such as Brighton, Manchester, Leeds, Liverpool, Norwich, York and Edinburgh have also seen growth.</p> <p>Traditional rental companies and manufacturers are getting involved, with Hertz, Enterprise, Ford and BMW recently investing in or acquiring car clubs. Avis-owned <a href=\"http://www.zipcar.co.uk/\">Zipcar</a> claims to be the world\u2019s largest network, operating in London, Bristol, Oxford, Cambridge and Maidstone, plus more than 50 cities across Europe and North America.</p> <p>\u201cMany [drivers] either dispose of their car or put off buying one when they join a club. We calculate that in London alone this has taken 25,000 cars off the road, freeing up space the size of 50 football pitches, reducing parking needs and congestion,\u201d says Carplus spokesperson Beate Kubitz.</p> <p>So should you put your car on the market and instead switch to using a vehicle by necessity?</p> <p><strong>The advantages</strong></p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We calculate that joining a club in London alone has taken 25,000 cars off the road</p> <footer> <cite>Beate Kubitz, Carplus</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The car club fleet is relatively cleaner than privately owned vehicles, typically producing 30% less CO2, while a growing number are electric with zero tailpipe emissions, according to Kubitz.</p> <p>Zipcar claims that just one of its cars helps to take 17 privately owned vehicles off the road.</p> <p>Christopher Morris, founder and managing director of E-Car, claims traditional car ownership is outdated, expensive and environmentally damaging. \u201cMost people can get around in exactly the same way through car sharing as with their own vehicle.\u201d</p> <p>With this in mind, his club is opening in more rural locations, including Stornoway in the Outer Hebrides, and the village of Harbury outside Leamington Spa. \u201cDemand has been high in these settings, proving that car sharing is not restricted just to large urban areas,\u201d he adds.</p> <p>Rachael Leach, a marketing manager in Earlsfield, doesn\u2019t need a car to get around London, but rents one through the <a href=\"https://carclub.easycar.com/\">easyCar Club</a> instead of taking the train on weekend trips outside the capital. \u201cIt is a lot more flexible than travelling on the train network at scheduled times, and costs around the same as two train tickets,\u201d the 28-year-old says. \u201cI have also hired a car for a day trip to Ikea when moving into my flat. I also like to try out the convertibles during the summer.\u201d</p> <p>Richard Laughton, chief executive of easyCar Club, which is backed by easyJet founder Sir Stelios Haji-Ioannou, says members tend to be younger, with 80% under 40. \u201cFamilies are still under-represented, but anecdotally a number of two-car families are shifting to hiring a second car when needed.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Know your need</strong></p> <p>RAC spokesman Simon Peevers says car clubs work best in urban areas, but overall usage remains low.</p> <p>The clubs represent good value for occasional motorists as the running costs, such as vehicle excise duty and maintenance, are typically covered in the monthly subscription fee.</p> <p>\u201cThe key thing is to do your research and make sure the logistics, in terms of access to vehicles, meet your requirements as a motorist,\u201d says Peevers.</p> <p><strong>The cost</strong></p> <p>Most clubs charge a one-off membership fee of between \u00a325 and \u00a360 to cover the cost of checking your licence with the DVLA and setting you up on their system. Many also offer a choice of tariffs. Some charge a monthly subscription of between \u00a35 and \u00a315 in return for lower hire charges. Others have no monthly fee at all.</p> <p>Renting typically costs between \u00a34.50 and \u00a37.50 an hour, depending on the club, tariff and vehicle. Some also charge around 20p a mile.</p> <p>The AA and Auto Express\u2019s Driver Power 2015 survey puts the cost of running a brand new \u00a318,000 petrol car at an annual \u00a32,559, based on 10,000 miles a year at 45 miles per gallon \u2013 an average of \u00a3213 a month.</p> <p>Although signing up to a car club looks cheaper, the monthly cost can quickly run into hundreds of pounds if you use it regularly.</p> <p>On E-Car\u2019s pay-as-you-go subscription there is no monthly fee. Hiring a large hatchback such as a Nissan Leaf costs \u00a35.50 an hour including VAT, with a maximum daily charge of \u00a350.</p> <p>With no other charges, hiring a car for five full days in a month would cost \u00a3250, easily exceeding the cost of ownership.</p> <p>Most drivers, however, are likely to hire for shorter periods of a few hours, and at \u00a35.50 that would give you almost 39 hours of motoring over the course of a month before exceeding ownership costs. For occasional drivers, running small errands or taking the odd day trip, there are savings to be made.</p> <p>Of course, this is balanced against the fact that car club members avoid the hefty upfront cost of buying a car, depreciation, and the subsequent expense of buying a replacement.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>If you rely on a car on a regular basis, and need access to it all the time, you may not experience the benefits</p> <footer> <cite>Simon Peevers, RAC</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p><strong>Insurance</strong></p> <p>Although there are no insurance premiums to pay, car club members will typically be charged an excess for an accident or damage for which they are deemed to be at fault. These usually range from around \u00a3250-\u00a3500, with those under 21 paying more, typically between \u00a3500 and \u00a3750. However, annual excess insurance policies are available from independent firms such as <a href=\"http://www.insurance4carhire.com/car-club-excess-insurance\">insurance4carhire.com</a> or <a href=\"https://www.icarhireinsurance.com/car-club-insurance-products\">icarhireinsurance</a>.com, for around \u00a340, which will reduce your liability to zero.</p> <p>Most clubs will waive the excess following an accident or damage if you are not at fault, so check with the club you are joining.</p> <p>Insurance cover with a car club is pretty much the same as with a standard comprehensive car insurance policy.</p> <p><strong>The pitfalls</strong></p> <p>One danger of relying solely on a car club is that you could be left without wheels if all the cars near you are booked up when you want one.</p> <p>If you know when you will need a car you can get around this potential hazard by booking as far ahead as possible.</p> <p>Car clubs try to match usage to demand, so will add new cars if a particular location proves popular. If you are concerned about availability, however, you could join more than one club.</p> <p>\u201cIf you rely on a car on a regular basis, and need access to it all the time, you may not experience the benefits,\u201d says Simon Peevers at the RAC. \u201c Equally, if you live in rural or remote areas it may be a challenge to organise a vehicle at short notice, depending on how the scheme is set up.\u201d</p> <p>Cars are cleaned regularly but not between every use, so there is a chance you will pick up a messy one. It\u2019s up to the driver to take their sweet wrappers home, and inevitably some people won\u2019t. Different car clubs have different regimes to keep on top of this, but all have numbers to report cars found in an unacceptable condition.</p> <p>Members are asked to leave the car in the same condition as they found it, and the onus is on the individual to report any damage or a lack of cleanliness to head office.</p> <h2>\u2018Access without the expense\u2019</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"718f9394c14d2e623d018305b2f40c15689c2ccc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/718f9394c14d2e623d018305b2f40c15689c2ccc/97_474_5159_3097/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Car club case study with Oliver Chastney, Norwich, Norfolk 29/09/2016\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Oliver Chastney with his car club car in Norwich, Norfolk.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Martin Pope/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The traffic in Norwich was a constant problem for Oliver Chastney, especially when he was trying to find a parking space.

  "<p>In the past few days a number of politicians and former generals have criticised the so-called hounding of British soldiers by what they claim are just money-grabbing lawyers launching ill-founded cases into alleged wartime abuse.

The reality, of course, is somewhat different.</p> <p>First, the idea that the claims are largely spurious is nonsense. The Ministry of Defence has already paid out \u00a320m in compensation to victims of abuse in Iraq. This is for a total of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/jan/22/david-cameron-wrong-to-deter-legal-claims-against-iraq-veterans\" title=\"\">326 cases,</a> which by anyone\u2019s reckoning is a lot of money and a shocking amount of abuse. Anyone who has been involved in litigation with the MoD knows that it will pay up only if a case is overwhelming or the ministry wants to cover something up.</p> <p>Second, allegations have been made about abuse of prisoners and civilians from the outset of the Iraq war in 2003. Three colonels in the divisional headquarters complained about mistreatment of prisoners within the first four weeks. In two public inquiries (into the deaths of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/sep/12/baha-mousa-justice-army-lawrence\" title=\"\">Baha Mousa</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2013/mar/18/al-sweady-torture-allegations-british-troops\" title=\"\">Hamid al-Sweady</a>), it was revealed that the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) \u2013 the most respected body in the world in matters of international humanitarian law \u2013 had complained about prisoner abuse.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Modern armies now have to comply with international humanitarian law and are rightly held to account if they don\u2019t</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Third, the complaints before the Ihat are not just from lawyers. They are also from serving and former members of the armed forces with no financial interest in the outcome, concerned merely that the government abide by the rule of law. These cases are sub judice but they are likely to be the tip of the iceberg. Some witnesses are too frightened to speak. I spoke to a former chaplain about five months ago. He too had come across soldiers beating up Iraqis, and simply told them to stop. He didn\u2019t report it.</p> <p>Baha Mousa was beaten to death in a unit interrogation facility, with no fewer than 93 sites of injury over his body. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/sep/16/british-troops-soldiers-condemned-drowning-iraqi-boy-forced-canal-invasion-judge-inquest-style-hearing\" title=\"\">Fifteen-year-old Kareem Ali</a> drowned in front of British soldiers who had forced him into a canal, then stood back and did nothing. And in the case of Faisal al-Saadoon, currently in the court of appeal, it appears that an Iraqi was gratuitously shot in the stomach and had his car vandalised whilst his head was being smashed into a pavement. Are these cases really \u201cspurious\u201d or \u201cvexatious\u201d?</p> <p>Even more disturbing, many of these investigations may lead to the door of the MoD itself. The Baha Mousa inquiry heard that his military interrogators were using the so called \u201cfive techniques\u201d, banned in 1978, which violate the Geneva conventions; the interrogators said they \u201canswered to&#xa0;London\u201d (the MoD) and not the chain of command. If this is correct then the MoD is at fault: the five techniques now amount to torture.</p> <p>Many of the allegations concern physical, sexual and religious abuse during interrogation. The conduct appears systematic, and the MoD has video recordings. It could easily verify any claim and now needs to come clean: I cannot believe that any defence chief would wish to defend physical, sexual or religious humiliation in interrogation.</p> <p>Finally, it has been well documented that there were secret detention facilities in the UK area of operations which appear to have bypassed prisoner of war facilities. If this is correct, it is in violation of the Geneva conventions and, if the prisoners were spirited out of the country, then that could amount to a grave breach. Soldiers were ordered to take part so the fault lies with their political masters. Trooper <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2008/feb/29/military.law\" title=\"\">Ben Griffin</a> is currently under an injunction from the high court (obtained by the MoD) for threatening to speak out about prisoner abuse in Iraq and Afghanistan. How extraordinary that the MoD has to gag soldiers for speaking out about prisoners when nothing, according to the ministry, has happened.</p> <p>As one judge remarked, the legacy of the Iraq war has been litigation. Modern armies now have to comply with international humanitarian law and are rightly held to account if they don\u2019t. There are many serving and former servicemen and women, including myself, who want to see an army that abides by the highest standards. This should be the aspiration of all of us. This does not impede operations; it enables them. If you stop the violations, you stop the litigation \u2013 it\u2019s as simple as that.</p>",

The aim of the experiments was to make the distant consequences of damaging consumption much more real. </p> <p>\u201cOne of the biggest problems with environmental issues is that there\u2019s a huge temporal gap, so it seems like whatever you do in the present doesn\u2019t really connect to the environmental problems in the future,\u201d explained study co-author Grace Ahn, an assistant professor of advertising at the University of Georgia.</p> <p>\u201cVirtual reality is an amazing tool in terms of being able to show you the really solid causal relationships - this is what you do today, and here\u2019s what might happen 100 years down the road,\u201d she said. </p> <p>The research is part of an emerging field that uses virtual reality to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media-network/2016/sep/08/electronic-empathy-virtual-reality-pokemon-go-oculus\">enhance empathy</a>.

In Ahn\u2019s experiment, some participants were prodded in real life to make being virtually poked with a cattle prod or bumped by a fishing net as coral feel more real.</p> <p>The study, which also involved researchers from Stanford University and the University of Connecticut and was recently published in the <em>Journal of Computer-Mediated Communication</em>, does not claim virtual reality produces instantaneous transformations in levels of environmental compassion. But it does argue it could be used as a valuable tool in promoting ecological awareness. </p> <p>After taking off their headsets, \u201cpeople said \u2018that\u2019s really cool, I\u2019ve never thought about it this way\u2019,\u201d said Ahn. </p> <p>A short period as a virtual cow is unlikely to leave someone \u201creborn into this person who has a thorough interest in environmental issues,\u201d she acknowledged, but longer-term exposure \u2013 perhaps during school \u2013 could be \u201ca lot more effective\u201d. </p> <p>\u201cI believe that it\u2019s able to amplify the qualities that you already have,\u201d Ahn added. </p>",
  "<p>Great coming-of-age memoirs have a potency rare in literature, and can be just as influential as great novels. <a href=\"http://www.biography.com/people/richard-wright-9537751\" title=\"\">Richard Wright</a>, outstanding in both genres, was an important 20th-century African American writer, renowned for his 1940 novel, <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/native-son.html\" title=\"\"><em>Native Son</em></a>. Together with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/aug/23/langston-hughes-harlem-house-art-collective-renee-watson\" title=\"\">Langston Hughes</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2008/nov/28/new-york-usa-books\" title=\"\">Ralph Ellison</a>, Wright was crucial in forging an authentic literary consciousness for the black community as it struggled to escape decades of oppression after the civil war.</p> <p>The bestselling <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/black-boy.html\" title=\"\"><em>Black Boy</em></a>, published in 1945 (its original title had been Black Confession), explored the background to <em>Native Son</em>, but was also a visceral and unforgettable account of a young black man\u2019s coming of age in the American south in the bitter decades before the civil rights movement.</p> <p>Full of vivid scenes and arresting vignettes, it begins with four-year-old Richard (\u201cangry, fretful and impatient\u201d) setting fire to the family home, a brilliant opening that establishes young Wright as a fiery protagonist. Indeed, he presents himself throughout <em>Black Boy</em> as a rebel, at odds with both his ailing mother, his faithless, improvident father and tyrannical \u201cGranny\u201d. After the fire, the Wright family headed to Memphis, Tennessee where they lived in \u201ca brick tenement\u201d.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The white south said it knew \u2018niggers\u2019 ... well, the white south had never known me \u2013 never known what I thought</p> <footer> <cite>Richard Wright</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Young Richard goes to school; his father deserts the family and his sons are put into care. Eventually, they move to Arkansas, where Wright broods on \u201cthe cultural barrenness of black life\u201d. For him, however, there is not even the consolation of religion. He\u2019s an atheist. In church, when his fellows sing: \u201cAmazing grace, how sweet it sounds\u201d, he is humming under his breath: \u201cA bulldog ran my grandma down.\u201d</p> <p>Slowly, Wright\u2019s mature character formed itself: \u201cAt the age of 12 I had an attitude toward life that was to endure, that was to make me sceptical of everything while seeking everything, tolerant of all and yet critical.\u201d</p> <p>This lifelong spirit, he writes, \u201cmade me love burrowing into psychology, into realistic and naturalistic fiction and art, into those whirlpools of politics that had the power to claim the whole of men\u2019s souls.\u201d</p> <p>Thus driven, and to escape the shocking racism of the south, it becomes his ambition to head north to Chicago as soon as he can afford the trip. But first, he must start out in life as a young black man in Memphis.</p> <p>The first half of Wright\u2019s \u201cconfession\u201d is set exclusively in the south; the second part, describing his Chicago experiences, entitled The Horror and the Glory, was originally part of a longer book with the working title American Hunger. For various commercial considerations, Wright\u2019s publishers requested that he focus on his Mississippi childhood and drop the final (Chicago) chapters. American Hunger became <em>Black Boy</em>, and would not be published with all parts fully restored until 1991, when the Library of America issued <em>Black Boy (American Hunger)</em>.</p> <p>The British, Vintage edition, though incomplete, is faithful to the 1945 edition. It subtly mythologises Wright\u2019s African American upbringing and fearlessly confronts southern racism. For Wright, coming of age was all to do with claiming and celebrating his identity as a black man. The south, he declared, in a fierce passage, had only allowed him \u201cto be natural, to be real, to be myself\u201d through a negative form of self-expression, \u201cin rejection, rebellion, and aggression\u201d. He continues:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"f715f606474a1f5db21f165340b8a4ca194ec102\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f715f606474a1f5db21f165340b8a4ca194ec102/0_924_2480_2452/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Richard Wright.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"989\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Men should be able to confront other men without fear or shame\u2019: Richard Wright.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy Stock Photo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><em>The white south said that it knew \u2018niggers\u2019, and I was what the white south called a \u2018nigger\u2019.

Well, I had never felt my \u2018place\u2019; or, rather, my deepest instincts had always made me reject the \u2018place\u2019 to which the white south had assigned me. It had never occurred to me that I was in any way an inferior being.</em></p> <p>As a youngster in small-town Jackson, Wright knew only too well what it meant to be a \u201cnigger\u201d, a second-class citizen. He worked as a porter in a clothing store; next he worked for an optician; then he moved to a drugstore, sweeping the sidewalk. But he had a fundamental problem. He \u201ccould not make subservience an automatic part of my behaviour\u201d.</p> <p>Finally, in November 1925, he arrived back in Memphis. This was not Chicago (a journey he could not yet afford), but it was a start. He began to read, educating himself by studying the Memphis <em>Commercial Appeal</em>. Here, he stumbled on the work of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2006/feb/26/biography.features\" title=\"\">HL Mencken</a>, and had his Damascene moment:</p> <p><em>Yes, this man was fighting, fighting with words. He was using words as a weapon, using them as one would use a club. Could words be weapons?</em></p> <p>Indeed they could. Better still, Mencken was introducing the young writer to a new world: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/belief/2011/feb/07/spinoza-philosophy-god-world\" title=\"\">Spinoza</a>, Gustave Flaubert, Tolstoy, Mark Twain, Thomas Hardy, TS Eliot, and many more. \u201cWere these men real? And how did one pronounce their names?\u201d Wright was hooked. Soon after this, he set off for Chicago:</p> <p><em>I was leaving without a qualm, without a single backward glance. The face of the south I had known was hostile and forbidding, and yet out of all the conflicts and the curses\u2026 I had somehow gotten the idea that life could be different, could be lived in a fuller and richer manner... If I could meet enough of a different life, then, perhaps, gradually and slowly I might learn who I was, what I might be.</em></p> <p>Wright\u2019s closing words evoke the rhetoric of the civil rights movement, making a surprising and unexpected link between himself and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2012/apr/06/archive-1968-martin-luther-king-non-violence\" title=\"\">Martin Luther King</a>. He has, he writes, \u201ca hazy notion that life could be lived with dignity, that men should be able to confront other men without fear or shame, and that if men were lucky in their living on earth they might win some redeeming meaning for their having struggled here beneath the stars.\u201d</p> <h2>A signature sentence</h2> <p>\u201cA quarter of a century was to elapse between the time when I saw my father sitting with the strange woman and the time when I was to see him again, standing alone upon the red clay of a Mississippi plantation, a share-cropper, clad in ragged overalls, holding a muddy hoe in his gnarled, veined hands \u2013 a quarter of a century during which my mind and consciousness had become so greatly and violently altered that when I tried to talk to him I realised that, though ties of blood made us kin, though I could see a shadow of my face in his face, though there were echoes of my voice in his voice, we were forever strangers, speaking a different language, living on vastly different planes of reality.\u201d <em>(page 32)</em></p> <h2>Three to compare</h2> <p>Ralph Ellison: <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/invisible-man.html\" title=\"\"><em>Invisible Man</em></a> (1952)<br><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/jul/25/100-best-nonfiction-books-notes-of-a-native-son-james-baldwin\" title=\"\">James Baldwin</a>: <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/notes-of-a-native-son.html\" title=\"\"><em>Notes of a Native Son</em></a><em> </em>(1955)<br>Malcolm X (with Alex Haley): <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/autobiography-of-malcolm-x-2.html\" title=\"\"><em>The Autobiography of Malcolm X</em></a> (1965)</p> <p><em>Black Boy is published by Vintage (\u00a39.99). </em><a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/black-boy.html?utm_source=editoriallink&amp;utm_medium=merch&amp;utm_campaign=article\" title=\"\"><em>Click here to buy it for \u00a38.19</em></a></p>",

  "<p>The lengths and depths to which governments will go to flog off precious public silverware knows no bounds. The extraordinary sale of the country\u2019s largest land titles registry is the latest piece of critical infrastructure to be thrown open to private control.</p> <p>The New South Wales parliament has just passed the <a href=\"https://www.parliament.nsw.gov.au/bills/DBAssets/bills/BillText/3330/b2016-079-d15-House.pdf\">land and property information NSW (authorised transaction) bill</a> and the process of selecting new operators for the registry is now under way. The last vote needed to get it across the line came from Christian Democratic MLC Reverend Fred Nile. </p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.lpi.nsw.gov.au/land_titles\">Land and Property Information</a> unit, which runs the registry, already had been carved off from the Finance, Services and Innovation departmental \u201ccluster\u201d, and for months the place has had the slide rule run over it by KPMG and Boston Consulting, with instructions from the NSW government to plump the registry for sale.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/sep/28/selling-asics-corporate-registry-highly-detrimental-to-economy-warn-data-brokers\">Selling Asic's corporate registry 'highly detrimental' to economy, warn data brokers</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The land registry is crucial for the security of property ownership. It guarantees the title to everyone\u2019s land, looks after the integrity of land data across the state, supports the mapping and valuation arms of the Land and Property Information service and returns an annual profit to the government of around $50m. However, it is expected that the sale price could be $700m-plus, which would consist of a one-off payment and an agreed return to Treasury subject to contract which would run for 35 years. </p> <p>The plan is contagious because South Australia, in its 2016-17 budget, announced it would invite private operators to run its land titles registry. Privately operated registries of public information is bound to catch on in other cash-hungry jurisdictions, as we\u2019ve also seen with the commonwealth putting <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/aug/18/selling-off-asics-trove-of-company-data-would-hinder-tax-enforcement\">Asic\u2019s company database into contention</a>. </p> <p>The state land registry is crucial to the protection of peoples\u2019 most precious possession. Its sale to a private operator has not been on the public radar, which is odd because what is at stake is the high level of title security that is currently guaranteed. </p> <p>The new operator is likely to be a consortium, comprising a bank, an insurance company, a foreign sovereign fund and an international superannuation fund. Certainly these institutions themselves would own and invest in significant amounts of real property. For large land investors to be operating the titles registry could be seen as an inherent conflict.</p> <p>Title insurance is rarely purchased in NSW because the integrity of the system of registration is sound and there\u2019s almost negligible land fraud. At present it is believed there would be no more than five claims a year against the Torrens Assurance Fund.</p> <p>Margaret Hole, a former president of the NSW Law Society, says there has been no independent assessment of the sale. Her concern is that once it is private hands title insurance will be necessary, as is the case in the United States. </p> <p>Title insurance on the purchase of a $1.4m property is currently about $990. Last year 213,000 land transfers were lodged in NSW, which means that conservatively $210m in insurance premiums can be raised by the operators holding the concession. </p> <p>Over the 35-year term of the arrangement, that would be $744bn from land title insurance, which until now has been quite unnecessary. Already, insurance companies have been knocking on the registry\u2019s door trying to get their paw into the lolly jar. </p> <p><a href=\"http://static1.1.sqspcdn.com/static/f/556710/27265162/1474969508743/Land_Titles_M.Hole.pdf?token=ocUk2KPkimDOBz2miQpgvH9G6UE%3D\">Here\u2019s Margaret\u2019s Hole\u2019s submission</a> outlining the issues at stake, and questioning the lack of public debate on the sale.

After four years they can be terminated. </p> <p>Berejiklian says that the government will retain \u201cfull ownership of all land title data and the data must be stored in Australia\u201d and price rises will be confined to CPI increases. </p> <p>The legislation also provides for \u201cstep-in\u201d powers and a new regulator will monitor the operator\u2019s performance. She thinks that the private sector is best placed to invest in new technology, \u201cwhich will have major benefits for consumers\u201d. </p> <p>These assurances carefully miss the point. The operation of the register, not the ownership of the data, is the key to the large potential profits from title insurance. </p> <p>And it\u2019s one thing for the registry to invest in new technology for electronic lodgement, and entirely something else for users to invest in the technology that gets them through the gate. </p> <p>The British government has run several consultations on its proposal to change the ownership of its land registry. In November last year the chancellor of the exchequer played with the idea of privatising the registry but that was abandoned once it was revealed that all the potential bidders were linked to tax havens. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/12/face-the-facts-competition-and-profit-dont-work-in-health-education-or-prisons\">Face the facts: competition and profit don't work in health, education or prisons | John Quiggin</a> </p> </aside>  <p>There was a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/mar/24/land-registry-faces-privatisation\">further consultation between March and May 2016</a> and to date the government has not announced whether there will be a next step.</p> <p>Those brilliant economic managers, Tony Abbott and his treasurer Joe Hockey, provided an alluring incentive to NSW and other states to become parties to what is known as the \u201casset recycling initiative\u201d.</p> <p>NSW premier, Mike Baird, signed onto this scheme in March 2015, whereby the commonwealth pledges to pay states and territories 15% in addition to the funds raised from selling public assets. </p> <p>The proviso is that the liberated funds are to be spent on infrastructure projects.
