We know them as the Stolen Generations. Delivered more than 10 years after the tabling of the Bringing Them Home report, it was, symbolically at least, the culmination of a milestone event in Australia\u2019s national story.</p> <p>The apology was cathartic and a seminal national moment, but it portrayed a fundamental misconception. It assumed, and the Australian people also assumed, that wholesale government sanctioned removal of Aboriginal children was our past and our future involved reconciling the consequences of this action and dealing with the harm it caused. We needed a roadmap and the prime minister\u2019s roadmap was the Closing the Gap strategy.</p> <p>But the separation of Aboriginal children from their families is not only our past.</p> <p>The distressing truth is that, today, Indigenous children are being removed from their families at a rate that is far higher than at the time of the apology. In fact, state intervention into Aboriginal families has accelerated child removal in the 20 years since the Bringing Them Home report. </p> <p>For South Australians, the experience of Aboriginal children in the child protection system has just been documented in the child protection systems royal commission. There, compared with non-Indigenous children, Aboriginal children are: 6.6 times more likely to be subject to a notification of abuse or neglect; 9.8 times more likely to be the subject of a finalised child protection investigation; 9.9 times more likely to be the subject of a substantial finding of abuse or neglect; and 9.2 times more likely to enter out-of-home care.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/jun/06/david-leyonhjelm-parodies-kevin-rudds-apology-to-stolen-generations\">David Leyonhjelm parodies Kevin Rudd's apology to stolen generations</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The alarming growth in the number of Aboriginal children being placed in out-of-home must be urgently addressed. The Closing the Gap strategy is failing to highlight this problem and without action Australia runs a very real risk of reaching child separation rates at Stolen Generations levels.</p> <p></p> <p>In May 1995, as the attorney general in the Keating government, I commissioned the then Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission to inquire into the separation of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children from their families. </p> <p> </p> <p> The inquiry recognised that while formal policies of assimilation had been ended, the experience of child removal continued. </p> <p>At the time the inquiry\u2019s report was handed down, statistics showed that Indigenous children were six times more likely to be removed for welfare reasons and that, in 1993, while Indigenous children comprised only 2.7% of Australian children, they were 20% of children in care.</p> <p>It was noted that Indigenous children were more likely to be removed on the ground of \u201cneglect\u201d rather than \u201cabuse\u201d with substantiated cases of neglect constituting 40% of all cases for Indigenous children, compared with 23% for all children.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p> </p> <p></p> <p></p> <p> </p> <p></p> <p>To address the continuing high levels of the separation of children from their families, the commission made a comprehensive suite of recommendations to empower Indigenous self-determination for the wellbeing of children. It was envisaged that negotiations would occur at community and regional level and result in customised models to meet local needs. The negotiations could have included the possible transfer of police, judicial and child welfare agency responsibility to local communities.</p> <p>In conjunction with self-determination, the commission believed that national minimum standards for child welfare would \u201caddress the rights and needs of Indigenous children, prevent unjustified removals and provide an open framework in which Indigenous control over child welfare and juvenile justice can develop where this is desired\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/ng-interactive/2016/feb/12/youre-not-given-any-love-the-stories-of-australias-stolen-generations-photo-essay\">'You're not given any love': the stories of Australia's stolen generations \u2013 photo essay</a> </p> </aside>  <p> The standards framework recommended key points, including: an initial presumption that the best interest of the child is to remain within their Indigenous family, community and culture; the involvement of Indigenous organisations in all decision-making concerning Indigenous children; the separate representation of Indigenous children in judicial decision-making processes; and that decisions to remove an Indigenous child from their family be made in accordance with the Indigenous child placement principle.</p> <p></p> <p>While commissioned by the Keating government, the Bringing Them Home report was presented to the Howard government in April 1997. </p> <p>The then Aboriginal affairs minister John Herron delivered the commonwealth\u2019s response in December 1997. The commonwealth government did not support national legislation to facilitate self-determination or to enshrine national standards for child welfare. Rather, the commonwealth announced a range of funding initiatives to support family reunions, which was described as the fundamental concern arising from family separation and its consequences.</p> <p></p> <p> </p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/video/2016/sep/01/language-is-my-identity-its-who-i-am-its-where-i-come-from-it-is-me-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/5xk4p\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2691601\"            data-video-name=\"'Language is my identity.

The committee gave a qualified pass mark to Australian governments on the incorporation of national standards for decisions on Indigenous child welfare but otherwise a fail mark to recommendations going to self-determination and the practical application of each of the national standards. It was recognised that the Indigenous child placement principle was adopted either in legislation or policy across Australian jurisdictions. However, the impact of the principle had been hampered by a lack of resources to legal services or other advocacy groups that endeavour to support Aboriginal families, particularly women, when children are the subject of welfare department activities. </p> <p></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/jul/14/fears-western-australia-will-close-remote-indigenous-communities-by-stealth\">Fears Western Australia will close remote Indigenous communities \u2018by stealth\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Australia\u2019s current roadmap to tackle Aboriginal disadvantage is the Closing the Gap strategy, which was announced as part of Rudd\u2019s apology and has been adopted by all governments through the Council of Australian Governments (COAG). The six targets are to: close the gap in life expectancy; halve the gap in mortality rates for Indigenous children under five; ensure all Indigenous four-year-olds in remote communities have access to early childhood education; halve the gap for Indigenous students in reading, writing and numeracy; halve the gap for Indigenous students in year 12 attainment or equivalent attainment rates; and halve the gap in employment outcomes between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians.</p> <p>Each target has a timeframe varying from five years to \u201ca generation\u201d.</p> <p> </p> <p></p> <p> </p> <p></p> <p> </p> <p></p> <p>While the Closing the Gap strategy recognises the need for holistic responses to deep and difficult problems, the reality is that the gap is widening for Aboriginal children being removed from their families compared with other Australian children.</p> <p>As of 30 June 2015, there were 43,000 Australian children living in out-of-home care as a result of the intervention of state welfare agencies. This represented 8.1 children per 1,000. </p> <p>In the same period, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children comprised 15,000 of the 43,000 children removed from their families. This is 35% of all children placed in out-of-home care, yet Indigenous children are only 5.5% of all children aged 0-17. The removal rate for Indigenous children is 52.5 per 1,000.</p> <p>Most disturbingly this disparity is rapidly rising. At the time of the apology, the rate of out-of-home care for Indigenous children was 24 per 1,000. It has risen each year since then to 52.5 per 1,000 in 2015.</p> <p></p> <p>At the time of the apology, Indigenous children were seven times more likely to be in out of home care. This figure is now 10 times more likely. </p> <p>The Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission found it difficult to quantify with precision the number of Aboriginal children taken from their families during the period of formal assimilation policies. Their estimate was between 10 and 30 % of all Indigenous children were taken. ABS surveys conducted in 1994 and 2002 provide support that the percentage of children taken was at least 10%. </p> <p>This means that the current rate of removal is now more than half the rate of the assimilation period and is continuing to rise. If the pattern of the last decade was to continue, then by 2025 the rate of removal would again reach 10% of the entire population of Indigenous children. </p> <p> </p> <h2><strong>A way forward </strong></h2> <p> We are at a critical point in Aboriginal child welfare. Surely Australia cannot continue on a path that is trending towards child separation reaching the same proportion as those of the Stolen Generations. </p> <p>What should be the response? Firstly, there must be prominent visibility as to what is happening and a target to reduce the gap between Indigenous and non-Indigenous child welfare interventions.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/feb/11/stolen-generations-hail-the-power-of-collective-healing\">Stolen generations hail the power of 'collective healing'</a> </p> </aside>  <p> The Closing the Gap targets should be amended to include an express target that the rate of out-of-home placement of Indigenous and non-Indigenous children be halved by 2025. </p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p>The benefit of making child separation rates a Closing the Gap target would be to give the issue prominence and would mean that the prime minister personally addresses progress in the annual Closing the Gap report to parliament. </p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p>A second response goes to the Indigenous child placement principle. The principle seeks to keep Aboriginal children with their extended families and, failing this, the local Indigenous community. A specific measure to assess reunification of children with their families within the national framework would highlight this critical objective. </p> <p>Thirdly, it is important that Indigenous communities play a central role in supporting families and that local organisations are equipped to fulfil this task. The Bringing Them Home report expressed this in terms of self-determination, while sometimes government policy documents adopt the language of empowering communities to take responsibility. In many ways, both concepts are different sides of the same coin and reflect that solutions devised locally will generally be superior to those developed in national and state capitals.</p> <p></p> <p>The separation of Aboriginal children from their families during the assimilation period of public policy caused enormous harm to Australia\u2019s Indigenous community</p> <p>Successive federal governments have endeavoured to respond to the consequences of the policies but it is a fundamental misconception to believe child separation on a wholesale basis is an experience of the past. </p> <p>The way forward begins with acknowledging that Australia has reached a critical point in Indigenous child welfare and the focus should be on this area \u2013 or the history of generational level separation rates might well be repeated. </p> <p> </p> <p>\u2022 <em>This is an edited version of the Elliott Johnston Memorial Lecture entitled A New Stolen Generation? delivered at Flinders University on 6 October 2016.</em></p>",

Easier still to forget how few cases are actually taken, and how few succeed. </p> <p>In any case, the argument for watering down Australia\u2019s central environmental legal protections is now being framed in terms of the cost of delay while the legal challenges play out, rather than the cost of blocking projects altogether. Which brings us back to the PwC report and the very big numbers.</p> <p>A quick search revealed the report had actually been <a href=\"http://www.couriermail.com.au/news/queensland/state-economy-missing-39-billion-and-2665-jobs-because-delays-to-adani-megamine/news-story/d0a653456208de71308f64d008c0f486\">first exclusively reported in the Courier Mail in June, as well as in numerous mining publications.</a> But PwC told Guardian Australia it was unable to provide a copy because it remained the property of the client who commissioned it \u2013 Adani. </p> <p>And Adani\u2019s spokesman said that even though it had been cited in numerous articles and a minister\u2019s speech the chief executive had determined the report would \u201cnot be released\u201d.</p> <p>Luckily Guardian Australia was able to procure it elsewhere, and it made for interesting reading. </p> <p>Its overarching assumption is the Carmichael mine will proceed, at the scale originally envisaged, and as soon as the legal hurdles are cleared. Many analysts question whether the project is financially viable at all, and <a href=\"http://www.afr.com/opinion/columnists/adani-prepares-for-an-end-to-lawfare-with-a-smaller-cheaper-carmichael-20160921-grla4o\">even those who think it is say the plan is to proceed with a much smaller operation.</a></p> <p>And even accepting that the Adani mine is ready to go, the figures are being quite creatively interpreted.</p> <p>The report appears to say, for example, that the mine will employ exactly the same number of workers as was always assumed. But if it starts three years later than originally planned, some of those jobs will be created later than first envisaged. The report averages the number of jobs over the decade from the original start date, first assuming the mine did start then, and then assuming it started three years later. The \u201c2,665 lost jobs\u201d was the difference in those averages. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/aug/29/greg-hunts-approval-of-adanis-queensland-mine-upheld-by-federal-court\">Greg Hunt's approval of Adani's Queensland mine upheld by federal court</a> </p> </aside>  <p>And those calculations were based on the project\u2019s original size and the original widely-advertised claim that the mine would create 10,000 jobs. </p> <p>But evidence from an economist commissioned by Adani itself \u2013 Jerome Fahrer of ACIL Allen \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2015/apr/27/adani-coalmine-would-not-deliver-jobs-and-royalties-promised-land-court-hears\">given in the land court </a>in one of the legal cases said: \u201cOver the life of the project it is projected that on average around 1,464 employee years of full-time equivalent direct and indirect jobs will be created.\u201d In other words, fewer jobs in total than those we are told have been \u201clost\u201d due to legal delays. Adani has said the higher estimate was based on a \u201cbroader assessment\u201d of the project\u2019s impact.</p> <p>The document also raises questions about whether \u201clegal delays\u201d have cost the company $200m. It says legal consulting costs were in fact $5.9m and internal staff costs to manage the cases were $1m. Another $21.8m is slated as the \u201cholding cost\u201d of maintaining a workforce. But the biggest cost by far was $123m, primarily for \u201credesigning previously approved components\u201d. The main redesign was due to conditions imposed by the federal government to force the company to dispose of dredge spoils on land, rather than in the water. But the former environment minister Greg Hunt boasted about this so presumably we shouldn\u2019t count it as part of the unbearable cost of lawfare.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/aug/05/linking-adani-coal-mine-to-social-uplift-in-india-ridiculous-says-conservationist\">Linking Adani coalmine to social uplift in India ridiculous, says conservationist</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It is true the company has faced additional costs because of the court cases.

They have since binned the clothing, as well as the original crowd mosaic earmarked for kick-off, writing off \u00a325,000 in the process.

His team\u2019s performances, starting against Malta and in Slovenia on Tuesday, may still convince the 46-year-old this is a role he should be pursuing.

But the only way to restore [faith] is through consistent performances.\u201d</p> <p>They will be adventurous and forward thinking against Malta, with Wayne Rooney expected to operate from midfield and the pace of Theo Walcott, Dele Alli and, most likely, Marcus Rashford to stretch the visitors.</p> <p>\u201cWe want to control games and we have the technical ability to do that but you have to take risks at times,\u201d Southgate said. \u201cMy job is to guide them and allow them to express themselves as much as possible. At the end of my period in charge, I\u2019d like to look back and say I gave them that permission. You have to accept the players won\u2019t succeed all the time.</p> <p>\u201cThe under-21s know I won\u2019t crucify them for mistakes.

Southgate admitted he would take a narrow, 1-0 victory, if the display had merited more. \u201cWe have to win,\u201d he said. \u201cBut what I\u2019m focused on is the quality of the performance. I want us to use the ball well, create a lot of chances. With the players we\u2019ve got, I\u2019d expect us to finish chances but I\u2019d take a clean sheet for sure.\u201d</p> <p>That was the interim manager being circumspect.

  "<p>When you are seven months pregnant, your husband and you go to a local hardware store. When you return 20 minutes later to the carpark, someone has put a folded piece of paper on your windscreen, held down by the wiper.

No one else has anything on their windscreen except you.</p> <p>You take the paper from him.

The children are inside a circle, which you think is the frame of the picture, until you realise that the image inside is cut into quarters by a large thin cross.

  "<p>There is a third rail for many film-makers, the alluring danger of quirk.

By being about nothing specific (is there even an elevator pitch here?) it manages to be about everything, a coming-of-age tale about a kid that\u2019s \u201cdifferent\u201d but not too different. Moreover, it proves that Mills is no dilettante, he has developed a very specific style that is, above all the poignancy, deliciously watchable.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/video/2016/sep/27/20th-century-women-trailer-mike-mills-new-film-starring-greta-gerwig-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/55vh3\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2756082\"            data-video-name=\"20th Century Women trailer: Mike Mills' new film starring Greta Gerwig \u2013\u00a0video\"            data-video-provider=\"guardian.co.uk\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-57ea8652e4b091b7fa2b5a53\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/09/27/160927TwentietchCenturyWomenTrailer_KP-29408603_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/09/27/160927TwentietchCenturyWomenTrailer_KP-29408603.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/09/27/160927TwentietchCenturyWomenTrailer_KP-29408603_WebM.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/video/2016/sep/27/20th-century-women-trailer-mike-mills-new-film-starring-greta-gerwig-video\">20th Century Women trailer: Mike Mills\u2019s new film starring Greta Gerwig</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>20th Century Women works as a diptych to Beginners, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/feb/27/christopher-plummer-best-supporting-actor-oscar\">which won Christopher Plummer an Oscar</a> for his portrayal of a 75-year-old widower and father living his last years as a gay man. It was taken from Mills\u2019s own family history and, after<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Mills_(director)\"> a quick glance at Wikipedia</a>, one can see how Annette Bening\u2019s character Dorothea is based on Mills\u2019s mother. (Were one to lay odds, one could also feel confident that she\u2019ll come away next year with her fifth Oscar nomination, and maybe her first win.) She is a free-thinking and independent woman, devoted to raising her son Jamie (Lucas Jade Zumann) as a moral individual, but strangely determined not to take action against her unhappiness. (In this version, the dad is out of the picture entirely, only calling on birthdays.) Dorothea takes in boarders in her enormous southern California house, which is under continuous renovation.</p> <p>Yeah, it\u2019s that sort of symbolism-for-dummies that a lesser film-maker wouldn\u2019t be able to handle, but Mills knows how to massage it into the background. He\u2019s also quite adept at weaving music and fashion of the era (the film is set in 1979) so that it is authentic but not overbearing. This is a movie in which a fifty-ish woman who loves Glenn Miller and Louis Armstrong takes a lesson in <a href=\"http://www.allmusic.com/artist/black-flag-mn0000091650\">Black Flag</a> v <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2016/sep/21/talking-heads-10-of-the-best\">Talking Heads </a>and, somehow, it isn\u2019t just an excuse for a director to profess love for his influences. By the time we hit this scene we understand Dorothea\u2019s need to try to understand the kids of today, and we\u2019re right there with her as she half-enjoys, half-shrugs at the current styles.</p> <p>Dorothea\u2019s style is more of the silk pyjama, ubiquitous cigarette, tuxedo cat on her lap and crooked smile variety as she gives motherly advice to the other two women of the title: Abbey (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/greta-gerwig\">Greta Gerwig</a>), a would-be photographer with a New Wave haircut, and Julie (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/jul/07/neon-demon-review-film-nicolas-winding-refn-elle-fanning-fashion-horror\">Elle Fanning</a>) halfway between worldly and bewildered, and the object of her son Jamie\u2019s affection. Her home is something of a base for everyone, and that includes the lost mechanic William (Billy Crudup), a good guy, but also exhibit A in how to be a distant and somewhat useless man. How each of these characters ended up in Dorothea\u2019s orbit is teased out through flashbacks, voiceover, use of pop culture images and readings from various texts. (The words of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2015/may/22/judy-blume-author-interview-hadley-freeman\">Judy Blume</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2005/oct/05/guardianobituaries.booksobituaries\">M Scott Peck</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/jimmy-carter\">Jimmy Carter</a> and the essays contained in <a href=\"http://www.robinmorgan.net/book/sisterhood-is-powerful/\">Sisterhood is Powerful: An Anthology of Writings From the Women\u2019s Liberation Movement</a> all make an appearance, as do clips from Godfrey Reggio\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2011/dec/15/my-favourite-film-koyaanisqatsi\">Koyaanisqatsi</a>.)</p> <p>Inasmuch as there is a traditional plot in 20th Century Women it comes when Dorothea realizes Jamie, now 15, needs more than just a mom to raise him, so she recruits Abbey and Julie to help out. She\u2019ll soon realize this maybe isn\u2019t such a hot idea, as Abbey, a cancer survivor, is still figuring stuff out herself, and Julie (still only 17) has put Jamie in the most epic of friend-zones, despite sleeping in his bed each night. By the end, of course, all will realize that this was the best idea ever, as this is, more than anything, a film about nostalgia, and how memory can be used to make everything seem perfect.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/video/2017/feb/08/annette-bening-we-can-all-learn-a-lot-from-jimmy-carter-video-interview\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/5qb9h\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"3177242\"            data-video-name=\"Annette Bening: 'We can all learn a lot from Jimmy Carter' \u2013\u00a0video interview\"            data-video-provider=\"guardian.co.uk\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-589b37a4e4b01b5caf3ce0b5\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2017/02/08/17020720thCenturyWomenJunket_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2017/02/08/17020720thCenturyWomenJunket_V3.webm\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2017/02/08/17020720thCenturyWomenJunket.m3u8\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/video/2017/feb/08/annette-bening-we-can-all-learn-a-lot-from-jimmy-carter-video-interview\">Annette Bening: \u2018We can all learn a lot from Jimmy Carter\u2019 \u2013 video interview</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>Mills\u2019s technique is rich with editing, music and (dare I say it?) quirky transitions, but, as with Beginners, the performances are what linger. All are terrific, and that includes relative newcomer Lucas Jade Zumann, but this is Bening\u2019s show. She\u2019s given some marvelous zingers (\u201cwondering if you are happy is just a shortcut to being depressed\u201d and, regarding her love of cigarettes, \u201cwhen I started they weren\u2019t bad for you, they were just stylish\u201d), but it\u2019s the type of role where merely watching her <em>listen</em> is a revelation. She\u2019s part-brash, part-terrified, wanting so much to be a strong mother, but worried about losing her son to the forces of time. I can\u2019t remember the last time watching a woman walk into a kitchen and just stand there got a laugh from an audience.

Rosie and I were keen to continue these negotiations this week and tried to arrange meetings with the leader\u2019s office to come to an agreement as soon as possible.</p> <p>However, it became clear on Wednesday that a reshuffle was underway, which had not been discussed or mentioned.</p> <p>It now seems to me that the party\u2019s leadership did not engage in the talks in any constructive way.</p> <p>Obviously, I deeply regret this turn of events.

He said the meeting had become heated and he had asked Hookem to continue to deal with the matter outside the room which the Ukip MEP read \u201ctotally the wrong way\u201d. He said Hookem then hit him and he bashed himself on the door frame. <br></p> <p>He told the Daily Mail: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Mike was obviously very angry and lost his temper. </p> <p>I wasn\u2019t bruising for a scrap. I asked to deal with the matter outside of the room because it was flaring up in the meeting and upsetting everybody, and Mike clearly read that totally the wrong way. It was a completely unexpected incident. </p> <p>Mike came at me and landed a blow. The door frame took the biggest hit after I was shoved into it and I knew I\u2019d taken a whack and was pretty shaken.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>\u2022Mike Hookem</strong> reportedly told the Mail that he hadn\u2019t hit Woolfe, and didn\u2019t see him hit is head, while a spokeswoman insisted it had been a \u2018verbal altercation\u2019 and denied that Hookem had punched Woolfe. \u2018Mike did not touch him,\u2019 she said.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I did not hit Steven and I did not see him hit his head.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>\u2022Neil Hamilton</strong>, Ukip\u2019s leader in the Welsh assembly, said he had been told by colleagues in the European parliament that Woolfe had \u201cpicked a fight with one of them and came off worse\u201d.</p> <p>Hamilton told the BBC:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>He toppled over and hit his head on a glass window so it must have been quite a wallop</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>\u2022A source</strong> close to the party put it this way: <br></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Steven Woolfe has then taken his jacket off, walked over and said: \u2018Right you, outside now\u2019 or words to that effect. </p> <p>They went outside and Steven Woolfe got the brunt of it.</p> </blockquote> <p>So that\u2019s clear then.

  "<p>Jeremy Corbyn has used his post-victory reshuffle to assert his authority by wresting back control of Labour\u2019s national executive committee and ensuring his closest allies retained the most senior shadow cabinet roles.</p> <p>The Labour leader reached out to his deputy, Tom Watson, with whom he has had a tense relationship throughout the summer, appointing him shadow culture, media and sports secretary in addition to his existing position.</p> <p>He also promoted Jonathan Ashworth to the role of shadow health secretary but stripped the MP, who is not seen as an ally, of his role on Labour\u2019s NEC, appointing the supportive Kate Osamor instead.</p> <p>But as the final team was announced, Corbyn \u2013 who began the shake-up by sacking his chief whip, Rosie Winterton, and appointing Nick Brown \u2013 faced an immediate backlash. </p> <p>John Cryer, chair of the parliamentary Labour party, wrote to colleagues to say he and Winterton had entered discussions in good faith about the possibility of MPs electing at least part of the shadow cabinet.</p> <p>The proposals were presented as a peace package between Corbyn and MPs after they backed a motion of no confidence in his leadership during the summer.</p> <p>\u201cHowever, it became clear on Wednesday that a reshuffle was under way, which had not been discussed or mentioned,\u201d Cryer wrote in an email.</p> <p>\u201cIt now seems to me that the party\u2019s leadership did not engage in the talks in any constructive way.\u201d</p> <p>Responding, a spokesperson for the Labour leader said the talks could continue with Cryer and Brown. \u201cShadow cabinet elections will be considered by Labour\u2019s national executive committee as part of a wider party democratisation at a special meeting next month,\u201d they said.</p> <p>Of the 63 MPs who stepped down as part of a mass resignation in June, only five have returned so far, although Corbyn has dozens more junior frontbench positions to fill.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>The shadow cabinet has kept all MPs who served during the acrimonious leadership battle, if they wanted to stay, although there are a handful of more critical voices.</p> <p>The reshuffle saw Diane Abbott become shadow home secretary, while the former director of public prosecutions, Keir Starmer, became the highest profile new member as shadow Brexit secretary.</p> <p>Clive Lewis told the Guardian that he was disappointed to be moved from the shadow defence brief, given his history serving in the army, but said he was looking forward to taking on the shadow business role. The shift in position came after Lewis told the Labour party conference that he would not seek to change the party\u2019s position in support of the renewal of Trident, despite Corbyn\u2019s opposition to the policy.</p> <p>The MP said he had not \u201csuddenly become an enthusiast for unilateral rearmament\u201d but was simply being realistic given that parliament had already given the green light to the policy.</p> <p>Other names tipped to join up including Dan Jarvis, Lucy Powell and Vernon Coaker were not in the final line-up.</p> <p>Replacing Ashworth with Osamor on Labour\u2019s governing board means Corbyn has stopped the finely balanced NEC from tipping against him.</p> <p>The move could be critical in weeks and months to come. Some speculated that Ashworth was given the choice of a promotion or the NEC position, but sources told the Guardian that his alternative was to be sacked completely.</p> <p>Corbyn said his new team had for the first time \u201ctwo of the three great offices of state shadowed by women\u201d and record numbers of non-white politicians. On Thursday, he appointed <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/06/nick-brown-labour-frontbench-return-chief-whip-rosie-winterton\">Diane Abbott as shadow home secretary</a>, while Emily Thornberry remains as shadow foreign secretary.

  "<p>About 100 current and former BBC presenters, and stars from other broadcasters, are being investigated by HMRC over claims of tax avoidance.</p> <p>The inquiries centre on allegations that the presenters falsely declared themselves self-employed to minimise their tax and national insurance bills.</p> <p>The revelation emerged in a BBC submission to a tax tribunal considering the case of the BBC presenters Joanna Gosling and Tim Willcox. They are appealing against an HMRC ruling that they did not pay enough tax while claiming not to be employed directly by the BBC.</p> <p>\u201cHMRC have indicated to the BBC that there are around 100 additional cases under consideration involving current or former BBC presenters,\u201d the broadcaster said.</p> <p>According to court documents, the BBC said it understood HMRC also intended to look into the affairs of \u201cpresenters who are engaged by other broadcasting organisations\u201d.</p> <p>It said: \u201cThe appeals are therefore extremely important not only to the individuals in question, but also to the BBC and to the broadcasting industry as a whole.\u201d</p> <p>The investigators are looking into whether \u201cIR35\u201d rules, which govern the tax paid by those who work for clients through an intermediary, have been followed.</p> <p>\u201cThe appeals are likely to be the first cases to test the freelance model in the broadcasting industry against the IR35 legislation,\u201d said Jennifer Henderson, the BBC\u2019s head of global mobility and employment tax, in the broadcaster\u2019s submission.</p> <p>The hearing before the first tier tax tribunal at the Royal Courts of Justice took place in July and was <a href=\"http://www.contractorcalculator.co.uk/100_bbc_presenters_face_huge_tax_bills_ir35_530210_news.aspx\">first reported on the website Contractor Calculator</a><a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/10/07/more-than-100-bbc-stars-facing-tax-avoidance-probes-hmrc-reveals/\"> </a>on Friday.</p> <p>The BBC stressed that the case would touch upon the whole broadcasting industry, saying that the practice of paying presenters through personal service companies was standard.<br></p> <p>\u201cAs the judgment says, this is an industry-wide issue and affects those who have been engaged in this way for a number of different organisations,\u201d a spokesperson said.</p> <p>In 2012, a report from Deloitte found that the BBC had offered presenters the option of signing staff contracts or using personal service companies, but had not advocated one over the other.</p> <p>The BBC <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2015/feb/26/bbc-stars-presenters-face-bills-thousands-unpaid-taz\">changed its policy that year</a> after it was criticised for letting presenters be paid through service companies.</p> <p>\u201cIt is up to individuals to ensure they pay the right tax and, since 2013, the BBC has adopted a new employment status test that provides a clear and consistent approach to the employment status of journalists and presenters,\u201d the BBC\u2019s spokesperson said. Joanna Gosling and Tim Wilcox declined to comment.<br></p> <p>An HMRC spokesperson said: \u201cEmployment status is never a matter of personal choice and is always dictated by the specific facts.

The results should be seen as a curiosity rather than a discovery until replicated and investigated further, Albertini said.</p> <p>The study compared ovarian biopsies from Hodgkin lymphoma patients, eight of whom had been given ABVD and three of whom had given a stronger drug combination (OEPA-COPDAC) known to cause infertility, and also samples from 10 healthy women.</p> <p>The patients who had undergone the ABVD treatment had between double and four times the density of visible eggs in the ovarian tissue than the control group, while those given the other drug had far fewer. \u201cIt\u2019s a big increase, not just a few,\u201d said Telfer. \u201cWe have no other explanation than that new eggs have been formed.\u201d</p> <p>Telfer said that the results stop short of proving that new eggs had been generated - but that this is her favoured explanation, because it fits in with other clues.<br></p> <p>Eggs from the ABVD patients appeared \u201cyounger\u201d- more like eggs seen in pre-pubescent girls - consistent with the idea that they were newly formed and had not fully matured. They also grew less well than those from the those from the control group, although these patients are known not to have fertility problems.</p> <p>Previously Telfer\u2019s group has identified what appear to be stem cell populations in the ovaries that can be grown into egg-like cells in the lab.

  "<p>There are, inevitably, vaginas. Of course there are; it wouldn\u2019t be a show about the 1970s feminist avant-garde without them. But the vaginas are not the central focus of the new exhibition at the Photographer\u2019s Gallery showcasing 48 international female artists over 200 major works from the Verbund collection. There is, after all, more to feminist art than the vagina; though curator Anna Dannemann does confess that she enjoys watching men\u2019s reactions as they round the corner and are confronted with Judy Chicago\u2019s 1971 work Red Flag \u2013 a close-up study of a crimson tampon being removed.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"de3c9c761ea9cfe87d2da2ca9b57bd683c3cb4c6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/de3c9c761ea9cfe87d2da2ca9b57bd683c3cb4c6/0_0_2455_3543/693.jpg\" alt=\"Hausfrauen-Kuchenschurze, 1975 by Birgit J\u00fcrgenssen.\" width=\"693\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Hausfrauen-Kuchenschurze, 1975 by Birgit J\u00fcrgenssen.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Estate Birgit J\u00fcrgenssens / DACS, London, 2016 / Sammlung Verbund, Vienna</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There\u2019s a certain kind of man who will read the previous sentence and bristle.

Chicago\u2019s photograph is aptly named; it is a confrontation that highlights just how radical some of these works were and continue to be, even today, in this TMI era of social media. </p> <p>The exhibition is well timed; this summer the world watched as a woman on a beach in the south of France was made to remove her clothing as men with guns stood over her, and the policing of women\u2019s bodies by men continues to be protested internationally. Earlier this week a photograph of an older Polish woman went viral. She was protesting the country\u2019s proposed anti-abortion legislation, and her sign read: \u201cI can\u2019t believe I still have to protest this fucking shit.\u201d Looking at the work of the 1970s feminist avant-garde provokes the same emotions.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"664e69087bd08cdd2f03eb87511b12549e29ccce\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/664e69087bd08cdd2f03eb87511b12549e29ccce/0_0_3543_2671/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ulrike Rosenbach\u2019s Art is a criminal action No. 4, 1969.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"754\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ulrike Rosenbach\u2019s Art is a criminal action No. 4, 1969.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ulrike Rosenbach / DACS, London, 2016 / Sammlung Verbund, Vienna</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Women are still grappling with the same issues that prevail in this thematically organised exhibition: the confines of the domestic sphere, the objectification and sexualisation of our bodies, cultural notions of beauty, and stereotypical gender roles. Running throughout is also the demand to be taken seriously as artists in an industry that venerates the male and excludes the female from the canon. Mary Beth Edelson\u2019s Some Living American Women Artists/Last Supper, 1972 makes the point neatly and playfully at the start of the exhibition. Indeed, many of the artists have their tongues placed firmly in their cheeks. Penny Slinger\u2019s Wedding Invitation 2, which shows a bride posing, legs apart, while wearing a wedding cake, is absurdly hilarious, though not a look I\u2019d recommend you replicate for your own special day.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"324c939d5e6b973c22ffb5dcaa4e52d90070cb20\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/324c939d5e6b973c22ffb5dcaa4e52d90070cb20/0_0_2634_3543/743.jpg\" alt=\"Wedding Invitation, 1973 by Penny Slinger.\" width=\"743\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Wedding Invitation 2, 1973 by Penny Slinger.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Penny Slinger / Sammlung Verbund, Vienna</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Much of the art examines women\u2019s relationships to their own bodies, so naturally there is female nudity throughout. I loved Hannah Wilke\u2019s series, where she starts off as Mary Magdelene standing on a plinth swathed in yards of fabric, and gradually strips until she becomes a half-naked Jesus in high heels. Of male nudity, there is just one example. Lili Dujourie\u2019s 1977 untitled series shows a naked man on the wooden floor of an apartment. At first glance you might think you were looking at one of the traditional female nudes that have long been the subjects of male artists. The so-called femininity of the poses and the length of the model\u2019s hair (it was the late 1970s after all) denote a woman, leading to questions about how artists have chosen to depict the body throughout art history. It is rare to see a male figure look so fragile and so beautiful.</p> <p>Dannemann\u2019s curation strikes a good balance between the light and the dark. The humourof artists such as Edelson and Slinger complement the anger and despair of some of the other works. It\u2019s quite an achievement considering the mockery of \u201cangry feminists\u201d of the time. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"376713ab11c31120a4f934d24310d36e7bfa7101\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/376713ab11c31120a4f934d24310d36e7bfa7101/0_0_3543_2612/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Lili Dujourie\u2019s Zonder Titel, 1977.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"737\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lili Dujourie\u2019s Zonder Titel, 1977.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Lili Dujourie / Sammlung Verbund, Vienna</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Flicking through an old Spare Rib of my mother\u2019s, I once came across an editorial headlined: \u201cWhy is this magazine so depressing?\u201d You could not ask the same question of this show, though it quite rightly includes some works that punch you in the gut. Most affecting was Leslie Labowitz and Suzanne Lacy\u2019s 1977-78 performance In Mourning and In Rage, a response to coverage of LA\u2019s \u201cHillside Strangler\u201d, a man who raped and murdered 10 young women. The public ritual they created in order to pay them tribute and demand action is profoundly affecting. \u201cI am here for the rage of all women!\u201d one says, and you feel it. The female victims of murder and sexual violence continue to be presented to the media in a grotesquely titillating manner.

  "<p>Are we witnessing the strange death of liberal Britain? After the<a href=\"https://www.politicshome.com/news/uk/political-parties/conservative-party/conferences/news/79596/read-theresa-mays-full-speech\" title=\"\"> \u201cflag, faith and family\u201d speech</a> of prime minister Theresa May this week, it certainly seems so. The most politically-effective proponents of the metropolitan liberal creed in the modern age \u2013 former Labour leader <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/07/tony-blair-says-his-return-to-british-politics-is-an-open-question\" title=\"\">Tony Blair</a> and Tory ex-chancellor George Osborne \u2013 are now relegated to making speeches and writing books. Neither turned up to their intensely tribal conferences. Since the vote to exit the European Union, wider liberal values have been in retreat. May\u2019s address cleverly painted the EU as representing something that was deeply unfair in society, tying Europe into a cosmopolitan rootlessness that was abroad in this country. Brussels, so the thought runs, promotes the idea that values are universally valid rather than varying across cultures. It was something to be resisted. She emphasised that in a Britain that was part of the EU individuality came at the expense of social attachments, and focused on the high cost of the pursuit of personal fulfilment. Yet Britain \u2013 the land of Adam Smith and John Stuart Mill \u2013 converted the world to liberal values. Not the other way&#xa0;round.</p> <p>In part May was responding to the nation and her party, which has gained <a href=\"https://www.politicshome.com/news/uk/political-parties/conservative-party/news/78467/50000-new-conservative-members-sign-under\" title=\"\">50,000 new members since the Brexit vote</a>. There\u2019s no doubt the mood of the country was much darker than many winners in the winner-take-all society constructed since 1979 had previously conceded. That was the shock: <a href=\"http://www.zeit.de/kultur/2016-07/juergen-habermas-brexit-eu-crises-english\" title=\"\">populism defeated capitalism in its country of origin</a>. Research released this week shows that voters who plumped for Brexit felt <a href=\"http://www.britishelectionstudy.com/bes-resources/brexit-britain-british-election-study-insights-from-the-post-eu-referendum-wave-of-the-bes-internet-panel/#.V_d1kTYrJ60\" title=\"\">marooned from wider society, psychologically powerless, and nostalgic for the past</a>. This perhaps was best typified by the finding that the <a href=\"http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/politicsandpolicy/personal-values-brexit-vote/\" title=\"\">death penalty, which was not part of the EU referendum vote, was possibly the best indicator of how people voted</a>: those in favour of capital punishment wanted out.</p> <p>This cultural divide will define politics in the years that come. It is already here in the rhetoric of responsibilities and rights. It is also true that a form of this politics has been with us for years. In policing, it amounts to zero tolerance. In schools, it is about instilling &#xa0;a regimented discipline. With employment, it is workfare. All revolve around the idea that popular opinion backs placing obligations to wider society above an individual\u2019s freedom. Corbyn\u2019s Labour is a reaction to this thinking. It rejects the liberalism that tempered previous incarnations of the party and has opted to mobilise a rainbow coalition of identities: ethnic minorities; young urbanites; graduates; gay people; greens. This is the heart of the 48%. Labour sees itself as the champion of the working classes but counts on shrinking trade unions to get out that vote. Tellingly, this week Labour lost a council seat with a large swing in its <a href=\"http://labourlist.org/2016/10/mixed-set-of-results-for-labour-in-heartland-by-elections/\" title=\"\">working class heartland to Ukip</a>, which appears more <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/07/steven-woolfe-mike-hookem-ukip-mep-clash-party-chair\" title=\"\">a party of punch ups than grown ups</a>.</p> <p>Fermenting the chaos are more saurian forces. In America the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/belief/2016/aug/25/the-alt-right-is-old-racism-for-the-tech-savvy-generation\" title=\"\">alt-right, the loose far-right movement</a> that exists largely online, overlaps with the Trump campaign. We have echoes of that racist misogyny in our own Twittersphere. For Britain the question is how to balance Enlightenment values with those found in society today. Economic liberalism left wastelands in our country, and reckless social hedonism went too far. Liberalism must learn its limits. But culture is&#xa0;not static: we are glad to be rid of oppressive marriages and repressive institutions. In leaving Europe we must ask who will protect consumer and worker rights. To be free from&#xa0;constraint and allow people to act to take control of their lives, liberalism will have to be remade for a post-liberal age.</p>",
  "<p>Rhododendron was a hugely impressive winner of the Fillies\u2019 Mile on the opening day of Future Champions Weekend here on Friday, but as the applause died away, the background noise was the sound of racing\u2019s administrators preparing to fight tooth and nail to stop any plan by the government to limit TV gambling advertisements. The possibility of a pre-watershed ban on the adverts was floated in Friday\u2019s edition of The Times and, while the report was speculative and anonymously sourced, it was enough to send a shiver through senior figures, both on the turf and beyond.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/sep/16/matt-chapman-itv-racing-betting-ring-roving-interviewer-role\">Matt Chapman lands coveted ITV Racing betting ring and presenter role</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Among those feeling anxious were the executives who negotiated a \u00a330m, four-year deal to televise racing on ITV from 2017. The value of racing\u2019s terrestrial rights depends almost entirely on the huge sums that bookmakers will pay to advertise in the breaks. A ban on daytime advertising would blow a hole in ITV\u2019s business plan as wide as Newmarket Heath, and reduce the value of the rights in future deals almost to zero.</p> <p>The digital channel At The Races also depends heavily on bookmaker advertising. Other sports, football in particular, could also see a drop in the value of their TV rights, but only racing has a fundamental link to betting as a primary revenue stream and a daytime ban would be catastrophic for the sport\u2019s finances.</p> <p>According to Friday\u2019s report, possible changes to the rules on gambling adverts will be added to a review of fixed odds betting terminals (FOBTs), the controversial gaming machines that have turned what were once betting shops into outlets for roulette and other fixed-margin games which were once restricted to casinos. The British Horseracing Authority kept public comment to a minimum, on the basis that the story is only a rumour at present.</p> <p>\u201cThe government hasn\u2019t yet launched its review,\u201d Will Lambe, the BHA\u2019s director of corporate affairs, said, \u201cso we first need to await details of the consultation and any proposals arising. However, it is likely that as part of any consultation that racing would be united in making strong representations for an exemption for horse racing content. These representations would be based around racing\u2019s obvious interdependence with betting compared to other sports, and the nature of its TV coverage.\u201d</p> <p>Privately, however, there is an awareness that this is an argument that the sport simply could not afford to lose. It could yet prove significant that consideration of an advertising ban will apparently be added to the long-expected review of FOBTs. The two should really be separate, since gaming machines are an issue only for those firms with significant off-course betting shop estates, but the move raises the possibility, at least, that one will be played off against the other, with bookies in effect told that they can carry on as they are with FOBTs or adverts, but not both.</p> <p>Racing will also be concerned that any compromise proposal that imposed an early-evening cut-off point for gambling adverts would bar bookies from advertising during terrestrial racing coverage, but leave much of the televised Premier League and Champions League football schedule on Sky Sports and BT Sport relatively unaffected.</p>",

  "<p>After his nine-year-old brother was shot dead by a St Louis crack dealer, but before one of his friends was killed in a hail of police gunfire, it occurred to Bruce Franks that he didn\u2019t really cry any more. So he had a teardrop tattooed under each eye to replace his own.<br></p> <p>His facial ink stood out on the streets of Ferguson, where he carried a handwritten sign telling those who would typecast him that he was also a college-educated business owner, a husband and a father. In case they didn\u2019t get the message, next he is taking it to the Missouri legislature. </p> <p>\u201cWe can march all day, but eventually marching is not going to change things,\u201d said Franks, the newly installed Democratic nominee for an ultra-safe seat in the state house of representatives. \u201cWe can protest all day, and protest is much needed. But it\u2019s not enough.\u201d<br></p> <p>Franks, 32, is one of a band of young protesters, blooded in Ferguson following the police shooting of 18-year-old Michael Brown two years ago, who have pushed their way into the political system of St Louis, the troubled town\u2019s closest major city, where the second US presidential debate will be held on Sunday evening.<br></p> <p>As they try to reform the criminal justice system from the inside, however, Franks and his fellow protester-politicians are troubled by the prospect of waking up on 9 November to something that they say would jeopardize their plans and like-minded efforts across the US.<br></p> <p>\u201cElecting Donald Trump as president would take this country back to the 1950s,\u201d Franks said of the Republican nominee for the White House. </p> <p>\u201cI \u2026 I can\u2019t even find the words to describe how bad it would be for what we\u2019re trying to achieve,\u201d said Rasheen Aldridge, a 22-year-old Ferguson activist who is running to be a committeeman.</p> <p>Amid a fiery national debate about race, crime and shootings by police, Trump has aggressively styled himself as the \u201claw and order candidate\u201d, pledging to further empower officers, as his Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton, allies herself with the mothers of black men killed by police and declines to seek the support of the nation\u2019s biggest police union.</p> <p>Trump has said that a recent spike in murders in Chicago could be stopped \u201cin one week\u201d if the city\u2019s police department, which is currently <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/dec/07/justice-department-investigation-chicago-police\">under investigation by the US justice department</a> over potential racial disparities in its use of force, simply got \u201ctougher\u201d.<br></p> <p>He opposes federal sentencing reforms that have been embraced not only by Clinton but even by some rightwing Republicans who share her desire to reduce the prison population nationally and abandon draconian mandatory punishments for drug offenders.<br></p> <p>He has promised to direct the Pentagon to resume supplying police with the kind of controversial military equipment deployed against protesters in Ferguson.

When they were six, and Eric was building Lego cities on the floor of his father\u2019s Manhattan office while listening to his dealmaking, Franks was mourning his older brother Christopher, who was killed during a gunfight between rival drug dealers on a stoop just across a park from where Trump and Clinton will debate on Sunday evening.<br></p> <p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t gone to these neighborhoods,\u201d Franks said he wanted to tell Trump, who frequently says on the campaign trail that the scale of urban violence is clear when \u201cyou go to Ferguson\u201d, despite not having actually visited the town himself.<br></p> <p>\u201cYou can\u2019t speak about Ferguson,\u201d said Franks, who estimates he has been to 140 funerals. \u201cYou didn\u2019t come to Ferguson.

He was a thug,\u201d said Jason Klobe, 44. </p> <p>Billy Bruns, a 90-year-old veteran of the second world war and a Ferguson resident for more than 50 years, who cast ballots for FDR, Truman and JFK, said: \u201cBrown deserved to be shot by the policeman, who was protecting his own life.\u201d Officer Darren Wilson said he shot Brown because the 18-year-old turned and charged at him after running away from a physical struggle at Wilson\u2019s patrol vehicle.<br></p> <p>Clinton is in no realistic danger of losing in November to Trump in St Louis County, the million-resident grouping of 90 municipalities including Ferguson.

No, obviously. He feels as significant a player in his national side\u2019s evolution as someone like Adam Gilchrist was for Australia. You almost assume now, when he bounds to the crease 30 or 40 overs into an innings, that he\u2019ll effortlessly take the game away from the opposition. Has he done so again here? The hunch is yes, given pre-match perceived wisdom that 270/280 is a par score at Mirpur.</p> <p>Of course, it wasn\u2019t a one-man effort. Ben Stokes hit new heights and Ben Duckett played with remarkable composure and intelligence on debut. Tellingly, Duckett sounded almost downbeat on TV just now in his post-innings interview, talking about various of his shots \u201cnot coming off\u201d or finding fielders. What a remarkable year he\u2019s having, despite the evident hindrance of playing for the sort of county side the ECB would like to wipe from the face of the Earth.</p> <p>Still, as Rob said, this is still a good and challenging test for England \u2013 perhaps the most truly unfamiliar conditions in which Rebranded ODI England have played in the past 18 months. Whether that means Moeen Ali and Adil Rashid will prosper from it or get taken to the cleaners by batsmen who\u2019ve seen their sort coming, we shall see. There was enough in there for seamers too, judging by the decent-ish performances of Bangaldesh\u2019s quicker bowlers, and that still might be where England make it count. Though Bangladesh are experienced (<strong>fun fact:</strong> their XI\u2019s combined number of ODIs played (929) is nearly three times England\u2019s (322), and formidable at home, they need to be more focused with the bat here than they were the field to win this.

There comes a time in every major security operation when you just have to play a bit of cricket. This should be an interesting series between the two most improved one-day sides in world cricket. We know all about England\u2019s Plain Jane Super Brain-style transformation in this format, but Bangladesh\u2019s has been equally impressive. They put Ye Olde England out of the last World Cup, and they have an exceptional recent record at home: 17 wins in the last 20 matches and six series victories in a row, including defeats of India, South Africa and Pakistan.</p> <p>Although Bangladesh have beaten England in the last two World Cups, they have never won a series against them. They have a great chance to do so in what should be spin-friendly conditions. The pitches will bear precisely no resemblance to those England will find in next year\u2019s Champions Trophy and the 2019 World Cup (both, in case you didn\u2019t know, are in England, and yes you have permission to be excited about the prospect of England maybe, finally, actually winning a global 50-over competition), but a lot of white-ball experience is universal \u2013 managing a run-chase, bowling yorkers, catching the cricket ball rather than dropping it pitifully at your feet. </p> <p>Those experiences will begin at <strong>0930 BST</strong>.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-10-07T07:49:44.551Z\">at 8.49am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57f74ccae4b03258bcac5352\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-07T07:22:17.737Z\">8.22am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Rob will be here shortly.</strong></p> <p>Meanwhile, check out Will Macpherson\u2019s preview from Dhaka \u2026</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p> Underestimate Bangladesh at your peril. That has been the message all week from England, and one reiterated by the captain Jos Buttler on the eve of the opening one-day international in Mirpur on Friday. Thereafter they come thick and fast: another here on Sunday, and a third in Chittagong on Wednesday. A week\u2019s rest and refamiliarisation follows, before back-to-back Tests.<br></p> <p>According to Buttler, Bangladesh are favourites for the ODI series, and there are plenty of reasons to back up that belief. There are the infamous defeats at the past two World Cups, although so stark has England\u2019s resurgence been in the format in the last 18 months that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/mar/09/england-crash-out-cricket-world-cup-bangladesh\">Buttler, Moeen Ali and Chris Woakes are the only three who played in Adelaide</a>.

  "<p>The Greasy Strangler hits the big screen this week and is a strange, grisly homage to cult films and to the midnight moviegoing tradition. From the mad, the bad and the weird, the shocking to the surreal, here are a few of the late-night movies that set the scene for greasy strangling.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/oct/04/greasy-strangler-jim-hosking\">The Greasy Strangler: 'Hopefully the imagery will stay with people'</a> </p> </aside>  <h2><strong>El Topo </strong></h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Uqb4Jy0GTg\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/6Uqb4Jy0GTg?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>With El Topo, Alejandro Jodorowsky did not think he\u2019d simulated a psychedelic experience, he believed he\u2019d created the psychedelic itself. It was the first midnight movie, an acid western and an \u201ceastern\u201d, an experiment in cinematic alchemy featuring occult symbols, castration, self-immolation, a man savoring the taste of a high-heeled shoe, a game of Russian roulette played in church. To the uninitiated El Topo was confounding, but to its devotees, it was a religious experience, like midnight mass with more marijuana.</p> <h2><strong>Pink Flamingos </strong></h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RKgmEw6xZE\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/-RKgmEw6xZE?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>A film about characters vying for the title of the filthiest person alive. As its tagline suggests, Pink Flamingos was an exercise in poor taste, but it was also a celebration of the outr\u00e9, a tribute to freaks, degenerates, rejects, anyone who\u2019s ever lived in a crib and really loved eggs. It existed outside the system, beyond the fringe, \u201cbeyond pornography\u201d according to New York magazine. It established Divine as a cult icon and defined the midnight movie. Pink Phlegm-ingo Barf Bags were distributed at screenings \u2013 if anyone vomited during the film, John Waters considered it a standing ovation.</p> <h2><strong>Enter the Dragon </strong></h2> <p>\u201cIt is like a finger pointing a way to the moon. Do not concentrate on the finger or you will miss all that heavenly glory.\u201d Enter the Dragon dropped Bruce Lee into a James Bond storyline, one with no guns and a whole lot more ass-kicking. It introduced Jim Kelly as a black power hero who beats up racist cops trying to keep him from the martial arts tournament where the film takes place. It brought the kung fu craze to America, graced us with the legendary cool of Lee, and taught us the art of fighting without fighting.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/jan/23/the-greasy-strangler-review-sundance-film-festival-jim-hosking\">The Greasy Strangler review \u2013 a playful oasis of filth and depravity</a> </p> </aside>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixqgOY4m3iY\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ixqgOY4m3iY?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <h2><strong>Suspiria</strong></h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7UefOfcly4\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/B7UefOfcly4?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>Dario Argento\u2019s Suspiria is a fairytale about a women\u2019s ballet academy run by witches where students die more often than dance. Like all great midnight movies, it ushers us into another world, one governed by dream logic. The hypnotic pull of danger drives its plot, as inexorable as a nightmare with images to match: a woman running through the woods, a blue-lit room inexplicably filled with coiled wire, yellow eyes watching in the dark, a McDonald\u2019s in Germany. It\u2019s a fairytale influenced by Bluebeard, Snow White and stories of witchcraft recounted by co-writer Daria Nicolodi\u2019s grandmother.</p> <h2><strong>The Warriors </strong></h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aRM2YcGpmxg\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/aRM2YcGpmxg?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>The Warriors is Walter Hill\u2019s modern Odyssey. \u201cThe one and only\u201d Cyrus seeks to unite all the gangs in New York City, and delegates from these gangs come together to hear him speak. But he\u2019s shot and killed, and the Warriors are framed. Hill presents these criminal protagonists as classical heroes as they traverse the dreamscape of their city and battle their way home from the Bronx to Coney Island. Pauline Kael wrote that The Warriors communicated \u201cthe anger of the dispossessed\u201d, but it also showed us their heart, their valor, and their cool leather vests.</p> <h2><strong>Ms 45 </strong></h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GObRvQexOmI\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/GObRvQexOmI?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>A woman dressed as a nun kisses a bullet alone in front of her mirror, then aims a gun at an unseen enemy. This is Abel Ferrara\u2019s Ms 45, also known as Angel of Vengeance. Zo\u00eb Tamerlis Lund plays mute seamstress Thana, a woman raped twice in the same afternoon, who kills one of her attackers and keeps his gun. Ferrara and Lund bring humanity to Thana, choosing not to play her like a maniac but a woman dealing with PTSD. Ms 45 is like Death Wish from a woman\u2019s perspective, the Platonic ideal of rape-revenge movies, and a powerful indictment of male violence.</p> <h2><strong>Evil Dead II</strong></h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awxz-8XR938\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/awxz-8XR938?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>In Sam Raimi\u2019s revision of The Evil Dead, an ancient evil is unleashed in a cabin in the woods when passages are read from the Book of the Dead, and Bruce Campbell\u2019s iconic hero Ash descends into madness and Kandarian demons. Evil Dead II had more humor and pathos than its predecessor: Ash kills his girlfriend when she becomes possessed and then he must fight his own hand and sever it with a chainsaw after it turns against him in a balletic, slapstick one-man show. It\u2019s The Three Stooges meets the Grand Guignol to create ingenious postmodern horror. </p>",
  "<p>Student leaders in South Africa have pledged to continue protests against tuition fees as the country braces for further campus violence.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Universities suspended classes this week after demonstrations turned violent, with police firing stun grenades, rubber bullets and teargas at stone-throwing students.<br></p> <p>The protests came after Jacob Zuma\u2019s government said it could not afford free education for all, though it would continue providing assistance for university costs for the poorest students.</p> <p>The University of the Witwatersrand (Wits) in Johannesburg had hoped to reopen on Monday after police clashed earlier this week with student demonstrators on the campus. Classes are now unlikely to resume.</p> <p>An <a href=\"http://www.wits.ac.za/news/latest-news/general-news/2016/feesmustfall2016/statements/general-assembly-postponed.html\">extraordinary general assembly</a> at the 120-year old-university, called in the hope of reaching agreement, was cancelled on Friday because \u201cno consensus\u201d existed, as well as for security reasons. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/higher-education-network/2016/mar/03/south-africas-student-protests-have-lessons-for-all-universities\">South Africa's student protests have lessons for all universities</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Leaders of the student protesters said on Friday they had hoped to convince the university authorities to back their campaign to force the government to increase subsidies to further education, and had no choice but to continue the campaign. \u201cWe wanted to get the university to join us. But if we stop now it means we go back to classes having won nothing,\u201d said Thalo Mokoena, of the <a href=\"https://www.wits.ac.za/students/src/\">Student Representative Council</a>.</p> <p>Protests have hit more than half of South Africa\u2019s universities in recent weeks. Though most have been peaceful, there have been frequent clashes with security guards and police. Several buildings were set alight at the University of Cape Town while at the University of KwaZulu-Natal last month a <a href=\"http://mg.co.za/article/2016-09-07-ukzns-src-condemns-burning-of-law-library-at-howard-college\">library was burned</a>.</p> <p>Last year a campaign to force the government to bring down the cost of university education led to a freeze in the level of fees. This year the ministry of education has said individual universities could impose a rise of up to 8%, slightly more than the rate of annual inflation in South Africa.</p> <p>Universities say they cannot make further concessions as last year\u2019s fee freeze has put their finances under great strain. Undergraduate tuition fees at Wits, which is one of South Africa\u2019s most expensive universities, are as high as 60,000 rand (\u00a33,500) a year depending on the course. Accommodation, textbooks and transport are also expensive.</p> <p>Such costs make further education beyond the means of many black students, who are around four times less likely to go to university than their white counterparts. Even fewer graduate. </p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s normal for maybe a third to drop out, just because they can\u2019t afford it. We paid our fees. But what about those who can\u2019t?\u201d said Tshikhudo Milalo, 21, an engineering student from Limpopo province.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Universities have become the focus of anger about broader inequalities that endure in South Africa more than two decades after the end of apartheid. South Africa remains one of the most unequal societies in the world, with new research showing 10% of the population owning <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/south-africa-needs-to-fix-its-dangerously-wide-wealth-gap-66355\">at least 90\u201395% of all assets</a>.</p> <p>\u201cThe aftermath of apartheid has not been sufficiently dealt with. You are allowed to go around but economic marginalisation hasn\u2019t changed much and opportunity certainly isn\u2019t equal. It\u2019s no way as bad as it was but there are parallels with back then,\u201d said Mokoena, 22.</p> <p>Commentators <a href=\"http://www.dailymaverick.co.za/article/2016-10-04-trainspotter-adam-habib-the-rock-the-hard-place-and-the-cruel-beauty-of-an-uncaring-universe/#.V_eimDJh3Jw\">described the protests</a> as \u201cthe moment of rupture, the noisy (if inevitable) breach of the South African democratic project,\u201d comparing them to the 1968 student movements in France, or the Vietnam protests in the US.</p> <p>At a meeting at Wits on Friday, student leaders pledged to continue what they called a \u201cgenerational struggle\u201d for justice. The movement, which observers say is less organised than last year\u2019s, has highlighted a fundamental difference between young \u201cborn frees\u201d who cannot remember life under the repressive racist apartheid system, which collapsed in the early 1990s, and their parents. \u201cOur parents don\u2019t understand \u2026 but they have been brainwashed,\u201d said Rose, a 19-year-old student who did not want to give her full name for fear of repercussions from university authorities.</p> <p>The row has also exposed a growing gap between young activists of the ruling African National Congress, and the elected officials of the party, famous for its role in the struggle to overthrow apartheid.</p> <p>Gwede Mantashe, ANC secretary general, recently said he would shut the universities to teach protesters a lesson. \u201cI\u2019m not the minister of education [but] if I was, my first reaction would be to close [the universities]. For 16 months. And open them after six months, and close the residences for six months. After a year, people will know higher education will be important for their future,\u201d <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://mg.co.za/article/2016-09-21-gwede-mantashe-i-would-shut-down-universities-to-teach-student-protesters-a-lesson\">he told reporters last month.</a></p> <p>Other government officials have said education subsidies should not come at the expense of other sectors such as health and housing.</p> <p>Many students do not support the protests, and very few support violence. A controversial SMS poll of students at Wits last week found that 77% of students who responded wanted the university to reopen.</p>",

She was no longer a political untouchable but someone to be revered. In recent years, I felt the mood shifting again; she was a feminist, a political role model and a fashion icon. It\u2019s something that occurred to me when I visited the Vogue 100 exhibition and saw a quote of hers blown up and hung on one of the panels. I was surprised and curious at how her narrative had shifted from one extreme to another.

I am worried that we'll become an isolated island and the world will move forward while we struggle to keep up in terms of diplomacy, science, economic and culture. What good is it to speak of global trade when shutting the doors at the same time. Why cut ties with the largest market in the world where we export 50%, half of our trade to and to pay for visas to travel only 20 odd miles across the channel. That doesn't make sense. Our NHS will crash and companies and farms relying on migrant workers because we don't want to do those kind of jobs any more will suffer. The pound is tumbling.

First, the contrast with Labour\u2019s conference the preceding week. The Tories judge that their main opponents are out of commission \u2013 desperately divided and culturally remote from the voters who swing marginal seats. Second, Theresa May has embraced Brexit with sufficient gusto, despite her quiet endorsement of the remain campaign, that Conservative pro-Europeanism has been almost entirely marginalised. <br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/05/birmingham-witnessing-tory-reformation-conservative-conference-brexit\">We are witnessing nothing less than a Tory reformation  | Rafael Behr</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The political landscape as viewed from Downing Street is now a subset of Tory internal politics. There are Brexit radicals (the old \u201cawkward squad\u201d in parliament) to May\u2019s right and a clutch of liberals to her left \u2013 the scattered remnants of David Cameron\u2019s modernising faction.

Mindful of that problem, May used her main conference speech to appropriate the referendum result for her own project. It was a shrewd rhetorical strategy. She set out the causes of support for the Leave campaign in broad cultural terms \u2013 a sense of dislocation, resentment of liberal elites, economic insecurity \u2013 so that she might then present herself and her government as the solution. It was, in essence, a mandate-grab to obviate the charge that she is somehow obliged to simply continue on the basis of David Cameron\u2019s manifesto. <br></p> <p>Whether it works will depend on how smoothly she can navigate Britain\u2019s departure from the EU. It is likely to dominate everything, cause great economic turbulence and crowd out almost every other government ambition. This is the defining paradox of May\u2019s premiership: she can claim to represent a broad public appetite for renewal and change because of Brexit and will struggle to satisfy it because of Brexit.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57f770ece4b05c2f1e952f49\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/sarah-marsh\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-07T14:14:35.753Z\">3.14pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Question of the week: are you worried about a &quot;hard&quot; Brexit?</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Theresa May made one thing perfectly clear during this year\u2019s Conservative party conference: Brexit means Brexit.</p> <p>The Tory leader said controlling immigration and withdrawing from the jurisdiction of the European court of justice would be her priorities during Brexit.

She didn't rose tint things, but she talked about how her interactions with people with Down Syndrome had positively impacted on her, and how it's now the best time ever to be a person with Down Syndrome. I'll never forget her opening words: &quot;Nothing I'm about to say will change the fact that this is a beautiful baby girl&quot;. If only she could have told us how amazing our daughter would be. Not only is she a spunky and determined wee lady, but cognitive testing shows she has no intellectual disability. She is in the 50th percentile for all children. I'm absolutely for a women's right to choose, but I honestly don't know what we would have done if we'd known before her birth. I do know that from time to time when she does something so typical of a child her age, I get an overwhelming wave of guilt that we might have prevented her from being because of our own fears and sense of being unable to cope.

Both Edward's and Patau's are more life-limiting that Down's and it doesn't make sense for the conversations regarding termination rates and other implications of this new testing to only focus on Down's. I carry a genetic translocation that can cause partial Edward's syndrome and I have been waiting for the day that the NHS introduce non-invasive testing with bated breath. My brother was still born when my mother was 31 weeks pregnant. My parents were left grieving for a baby who was incredibly unwell and would not have lived outside the womb for more than a couple of days even if he had made it to term. They had to tell their 2 year old that there wasn't going to be a baby. I now have to face the decisions of if/when/how to test my pregnancies and face the decisions that may follow any results.</p> <p>If we're going to have a &quot;long overdue and nuanced conversation&quot; about non-invasive testing in the light of Down's syndrome, we need to have a separate discussion about Edward's &amp; Patau's because the results for infants with the condition, and for families, are starkly different.</p></div> </div> </div>  </figure>  <p>What do you think?<br></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57f7a362e4b0e4aaeaa8cede\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-07T13:30:23.258Z\">2.30pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-comment\" data-canonical-url=\"https://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/84865437\">  <div class=\"d2-comment-embedded\" itemscope itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Comment\"> <div class=\"d2-left-col\"> <a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/2572895\" title=\"View LolliusAgrippa\u2019s profile\"> <img class=\"d2-avatar\" src=\"https://avatar.guim.co.uk/user/2572895\" height=\"40\" width=\"40\" alt=\"User avatar for LolliusAgrippa\"> </a> </div> <div class=\"d2-right-col\"> <div itemscope itemprop=\"author\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\"> <a class=\"d2-username\" href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/2572895\" title=\"View LolliusAgrippa\u2019s profile\" itemprop=\"url\"> <span itemprop=\"givenName\">LolliusAgrippa</span> </a> </div> <div class=\"d2-permalink\"> <a class=\"d2-datetime\" href=\"https://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/84865437\" title=\"Link to this comment\" itemprop=\"datePublished\">07 October 2016 2:24pm</a> </div> <div class=\"d2-body\" itemprop=\"text\"><p>Class as a category is dead, its effectively meaningless.

  "<p>A ground assault on Mosul, the last major Islamic State stronghold in Iraq, is due to be launched by the end of the month, with Iraqi troops moving into their final staging positions to the south of the city.</p> <p>Officials in Baghdad expect the push to begin around 15 October, although US officials who have trained and advised Iraqi forces for the past two years are understood to be less focused on a fixed date and are making plans for the battle to start up to 10 days later.</p> <p>But, while victory over the terror group appears very likely, gnawing doubts remain over what comes next.</p> <p>While military moves are at an advanced stage, the questions of how to provide for up to 1.3 million refugees, or how to re-establish governance in a city brutalised by two years of tyranny is increasingly consuming aid agencies and regional officials, some of whom believe that whatever emerges from Mosul will determine the fate of Iraq.</p> <p>Sectarian concerns have dominated pre-battle planning, with Shia militias and Kurdish peshmerga forces who have played vital roles in the war against Isis not slated to enter the largely Sunni Muslim city. The Iraqi military, which is largely made up of Shia soldiers and officers, will take the lead in the battle, with up to three divisions \u2013 roughly 45,000 men \u2013 advancing from positions near the Qaiyara airbase 30 miles south.</p> <p>Isis is thought to have between 5,000 and 8,000 members prepared to defend their last redoubt in Iraq, where in June 2014 the leader of Isis, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, used the city\u2019s Nouri mosque to declare the establishment of a caliphate and himself as leader. Since then, Mosul has been central to the group\u2019s ambitions to spread its ruthless interpretation of Islamic law throughout the Arab world and beyond.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/04/iraqi-kurdish-peshmerga-fear-isis-chemical-attack-mosul\">Iraqi Kurdish peshmerga ask UK for help against Isis chemical attack</a> </p> </aside>  <p>An Iraqi security source said: \u201cWhen you have one million people you have to be precise with each attack; it requires really good intelligence that will slow things down.

Up to 500,000 residents are expected to move into Kurdish-controlled areas to the east, while at least 500,000 more could flee to areas controlled by the Iraqi military to the south or west.</p> <p>Unicef says more than 213,000 people have fled Mosul since May this year, and more than 3.3 million people have been displaced across Iraq since early 2014.</p> <p>\u201cMore than 700,000 people are likely to require shelter and other life-saving assistance,\u201d said Unicef Middle East and North Africa spokesperson, Farah Dakhlallah. \u201cFamilies are undertaking terrifying journeys through active conflict zones littered with unexploded ordnance and improvised explosive devices, often at night, sometimes walking up to 60km to escape to safety.\u201d</p> <p>Unicef says its aid efforts are $13m (\u00a310.4m) underfunded. Other agencies report similar shortfalls. Kurdish officials have prepared 20 refugee camps near the town of Makhmour, south-east of Mosul.</p> <p>Iraq\u2019s counter-terrorism forces, which performed well in the four-week battle to retake Falluja in June, are expected to lead the fight. Peshmerga units are planning to take up blocking positions to the north and east, where they will also receive and screen refugees. The Popular Mobilisation Units, known in Iraq as Hashd al-Shabi, have been confined to a blocking role to the west of Mosul, over concerns their presence could amplify sectarian tensions that had remained high throughout the post-Saddam years.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/11/mosul-the-city-that-will-define-not-just-iraqs-war-but-its-future\">Mosul: suspicion and hostility cloud fight to recapture Iraqi city from Isis</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Those tensions had peaked before Isis swept into the city in June 2014.

The US, which maintained a presence in Mosul until 2010, no longer has an occupying presence in Iraq. Barack Obama has made clear that the 6,000 troops his administration has re-deployed are there only to fight Isis and not to provide military muscle in support of a diplomatic push to hold the country together.</p> <p>The Iraqi intelligence official said: \u201cThere is an agreement about the structure, and the order in which [forces] come in. This is the last battle in Iraq and everyone wants to be included. It was a wise move to let the Shia militia be involved but in designated areas, and under control.

There are small elements trying to assassinate [Isis], and trying to make them feel uncomfortable, but it largely depends on the tribes. We are trying to tell the Sunnis inside this is coming, and people reaching out to them and saying they have a second chance.\u201d</p>",

They are also taught how to read intelligence into the places they are planning to attack; about enemy strength, weapons and the best route of approach.</p> <p>Back outside eight children move across a small field, making weapon signs with their hands and pretending to shoot.

It\u2019s not dangerous; they are not using live weapons.\u201d</p> <p>The Ministry of Defence is keen to point out that the programme in schools will be a watered down version of the traditional cadet units.

The number of moisturising products that must be applied thrice-daily in order to maintain such a flawless visage. The feeling of guilt that everyone cannot be so visually wonderful. The sense of disgust at all these hideous trolls scampering around your feet.

They explain:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p> The problem with finding the actual low is that currencies are traded on dozens of different platforms, and the levels each shows reflect the trades that are conducted on that system.

Earlier, the system reported a trade at $1.1378 \u2013 wildly below the other big platforms. That has since been scrubbed from the system. It is however standing by an absolute low of $1.1491 in a trade at 23.07 GMT \u2013 or 7.07am Hong Kong time, which is when the plunge began.</p> \n   <p>That is not all. Reuters is also publishing a \u201cmarket low\u201d where a \u201cgood amount\u201d \u2013 ie, \u00a35m or more, was traded within a 3 minute window.

It took a further 30 minutes for the pound to regain $1.24, during which time activity was fairly steady as traders regained composure after that unnerving tumble. </p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-10-07T08:55:38.053Z\">at 9.55am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-57f7575fe4b05c2f1e952edb\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-07T08:12:41.646Z\">9.12am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>The pound is on course for a 4% drop against the dollar, currently trading at $1.24.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"63c3bad7939db7dd619e95929c6eebbdc7ac3e31\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/63c3bad7939db7dd619e95929c6eebbdc7ac3e31/0_0_1480_693/1000.jpg\" alt=\"pound week\" width=\"1000\" height=\"468\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n  </figure> \n  <p>The pound is also down 1.1% against the euro, at \u20ac1.1181.</p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-57f753bee4b05c2f1e952ece\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-07T07:51:48.446Z\">8.51am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>So how is the dramatic overnight crash in the pound going down in the City? </p> \n  <p>Here is a inside take on what might be happening on London\u2019s trading floors:</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/PolemicTMM/status/784197253946892288\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">GBP you want to know what's gong on?

  "<p>My flight touched down at Bangkok\u2019s Suvarnabhumi airport without any problems, at about midnight on 5 October. I had been invited to share my experiences of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/apr/10/hong-kongs-umbrella-movement-spawns-new-political-party-demosisto\">Hong Kong\u2019s umbrella movement</a> at two universities in Bangkok and to talk about becoming a young politician. </p> <p>But as I left the plane, I started to feel paranoid that officials at the immigration counter might take me away and deport me back to Hong Kong on the very same flight. A strange feeling came over me. I could see more staff than usual ahead of me. But there was nowhere else to go. When I stepped on to the bridge leading off the plane, I saw a crowd of immigration police. I knew something was wrong.</p> <p>What surprised me was that, unlike <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/may/26/hong-kong-pro-democracy-student-activist-refused-entry-malaysia\">when I was refused entry to Malaysia</a> \u2013 in May 2015, this time I didn\u2019t have to go to the counter to be taken away. This time the officials came to meet me. </p> <p>They asked if I was Joshua Wong. I told them I was. </p> <p>And as soon as I had acknowledged my identity, they announced the order from Thai authorities to detain me and asked me to hand over my passport. I was very nervous. I never would have expected this to happen having barely stepped off the plane. </p> <p>The unfamiliar environment knocked me off balance. The last time I felt this sensation \u2013 that my heart was about to leap out from my chest \u2013 had been two years ago, in 2014, when I was arrested during the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/sep/27/hong-kong-democracy-activists-ask-what-protest-achieved-umbrella\">umbrella movement protests</a>. <br></p> <p>Had this been happening in Hong Kong, I would at least have been able to contact lawyers or the media to buy some time. But Bangkok airport was a foreign place to me, and my phone wouldn\u2019t connect to the airport Wi-Fi. I couldn\u2019t reach anyone for help. I had no choice but to surrender my passport. </p> <p>The customs officer told me I had been blacklisted by the Thai government and would not be permitted to enter the country. After handing over my passport, I was made to follow more than 20 customs and police officers to an unknown location. My heartbeat quickened and I was filled with a feeling of helplessness. We had been walking all over the place since my arrival and the only word I had been able to understand from them was \u201cblacklist\u201d. </p> <p>After they took me to the detention cell, I couldn\u2019t bear it any longer. I asked which articles of their law allowed them to put a foreign citizen in a detention cell without good reason. I asked to be allowed to contact my family, or even just a local lawyer. <br></p> <p>But my passport had been taken away, and I had been forbidden to use my phones or computers, so I could not contact anyone. They could do as they pleased. My two requests \u2013 to contact a lawyer and for them to explain the legality of their action \u2013 were both rejected with a simple \u201cNo\u201d. <br></p> <p>I criticised them for detaining me without any legal basis as something that was a violation of human rights and they replied: \u201cWe\u2019ll tell you why once we have you detained.\u201d I continued to point out that they were violating proper police procedure, but they simply replied: \u201cYou know this is Thailand, it\u2019s like China. Not like Hong Kong!\u201d </p> <p>I repeated those words to myself.</p> <p>\u201cYou know this is Thailand, it\u2019s like China. Not like Hong Kong!\u201d </p> <p>\u201cYou know this is Thailand, it\u2019s like China. Not like Hong Kong!\u201d </p> <p>\u201cYou know this is Thailand, it\u2019s like China. Not like Hong Kong!\u201d </p> <p>He was right, I thought. It is like China \u2013 not like Hong Kong. After all, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/dec/08/gui-minhai-the-strange-disappearance-of-a-publisher-who-riled-chinas-elite\">Hong Kong publisher Gui Minhai was kidnapped in Thailand</a> last year and was eventually sent to mainland China. </p> <p>My discussion with the police officer ended with him making the assertion: \u201cYou know we can treat you nicely like we are now. But we can also make it hard for you. We believe you understand how far we can go.\u201d I was fully aware of this. In fact, everyone in Hong Kong is fully aware of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jun/17/china-behaving-like-gangster-state-with-bookseller-kidnap-say-hong-kong-politicians\">bookseller scandal</a>, which saw five local booksellers taken away to mainland China. </p> <p>At about two o\u2019clock in the morning I was put in a cell at the airport. </p> <p>At first I thought the worst that could happen would be that the 20 police officers would \u201ckeep me company\u201d in the airport waiting room before putting me on a flight back to Hong Kong. </p> <p>What I never expected was that I was about to be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/05/hong-kong-activist-joshua-wong-detained-thailand-china-deportation\">locked up in a foreign country</a> merely for agreeing to speak at the top university there. </p> <p>Detention cells in Hong Kong are not pleasant. In Thailand they are even worse. In Hong Kong you are at least allowed to see your lawyers. Two years ago <a href=\"https://twitter.com/theapjournalist/status/515533206721150976\">I was arrested in Hong Kong</a> for storming the Civic Square two days before the umbrella movement erupted and I was able to seek release by filing a habeas corpus petition in court. </p> <p>In Thailand detention centres are far more unpleasant. The lack of hygiene and the language barrier were not even the main problems. The worst thing was being cut off from the outside world in this tightly sealed cell. You can\u2019t see the light and you don\u2019t know what time it is. You don\u2019t know how long you will have to wait. But you do know that you won\u2019t have the chance to help yourself through any legal means \u2013 because there is no rule of law.</p> <p>In this 50sq ft cell, my mind was troubled; I felt terrified and uneasy. I wondered if my friends and colleagues from my <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/apr/10/hong-kongs-umbrella-movement-spawns-new-political-party-demosisto\">political party Demosisto</a> would be worried, seeing that I had not appeared online; I wondered what my family and girlfriend might be thinking, having heard nothing from me; I wondered if my friends from Thai student movements might be able to get me out having not seen me at the airport; I wondered how the Hong Kong government might respond to this, or if it would simply ignore it as if it never happened. I felt frightened. I wanted to cry. </p> <p>Being cut off from the outside world is scary. But I told myself not to cry. No matter what happened, I should not cry. I could not let the police \u2013 the tools of the government \u2013 feel like they had defeated me. Looking at the walls of the cell, I kept thinking about when I might be able to go home. Would it be tomorrow morning? At noon? Or perhaps a day later? </p> <p>It sounds crazy, but I was truly worried that the Thai government might take me off to one of its courts, under some national security article, and wait a couple of weeks before deporting me home. Or perhaps worse, they might find me guilty and keep me in jail for years. The worst that I imagined could happen \u2013 although just for an instant \u2013 was that they might deport me to mainland China, as they had done to the five Hong Kong booksellers who went missing last year. </p> <p>You may think I was overreacting by thinking that I would never be able to go home. When I started having these negative thoughts, I tried to remind myself that \u2013 even in the worst-case scenario \u2013 I wouldn\u2019t be jailed in Thailand, let alone deported to mainland China. My voice of reason told me such scenarios were far-fetched. </p> <p>But you know what? When the physical conditions are so hostile, and you can\u2019t breathe because of the repressive atmosphere around you, this kind of fear grows inside you. Because the reality was that I was detained in a foreign country, with no access to legal assistance or the media, and I was not even sure I would be permitted to return home. </p> <p>My mind became so troubled that I wasn\u2019t able to sleep. Finally I realised what \u201cfreedom from fear\u201d actually means. This detention experience was 100 times more terrifying than the five previous times I was arrested in Hong Kong.<strong> <br></strong></p> <p>By noon the following day I was told I would be put on the next flight home. A huge load was lifted off my shoulders. Just before I left I was given a document from the immigration office, declaring that they had rejected my entry into the country according to Sections 19, 22 and 54 of the Immigration Act B.E. 2522.</p> <p>So after China, Macau and Malaysia, there is now another territory I know I cannot enter. In fact, I still don\u2019t understand why. I have never criticised the Thai government. I was only invited there to share my experiences of being a young man who took part in the umbrella movement. And this led to me being detained as soon as I stepped off the plane and being treated in a way that goes completely against human rights and the law. I spent almost 12 hours in detention and was deprived of my passport and of contact with others. </p> <p>I am absolutely certain that my unlawful detention by the Thai authorities was motivated by their fear of youth movements around the world.</p> <p>Indeed, young people right across the globe will only become more united and engaged as our collective yearning for democracy, civil liberties and other universal values strengthens.

  "<p>\u201cBring it on, lads,\u201d Sam Allardyce exclaimed at a press conference three days after accepting the job of managing England. So they did. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/27/gareth-southgate-england-sam-allardcye-exit\" title=\"\">And 64 days later he was gone</a>.</p> <p>The \u201clads\u201d had wiped him out, turning him into a candidate for a spectacular entry in the Guinness World Records. Allardyce became the recipient of the largest amount of money ever paid to a man for supervising a single game of football: about \u00a3550,000 in salary over the two months, plus a reported \u00a31m in \u201ccompensation\u201d for \u00a36m he had been due to earn under the terms of the truncated two-year contract.</p> <p>To the FA\u2019s outlay could be added the \u00a33m they were required to pay Sunderland for securing his services in the first place. That made it four and a half million quid for two halves of very unsatisfactory football barely redeemed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/04/slovakia-england-world-cup-2018-qualifier-sam-allardyce\" title=\"\">by a lucky 95th-minute winner</a>. In itself the match represented perhaps the most unimpressive debut by an England manager since the autumn of 1977 when Ron Greenwood, given temporary charge \u2013 despite a popular clamour for Brian Clough \u2013 after Don Revie\u2019s sudden retreat to the United Arab Emirates, packed his team with seven Liverpool players and watched them fumble and fret to a goalless friendly draw with Switzerland at a half-full Wembley.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/oct/06/football-quiz-england-manager-quotes\">'I don't know what I'm doing here': which England managers gave these quotes?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Allardyce\u2019s appointment was always going to provide the answer to a question that had become tiresome. Finally we would know what happened if he got the job. Could the son of Dudley turn into the mythical Allardici of his own imagination, infusing England\u2019s players not merely with bullish confidence but with sophisticated tactical awareness? Or would he prove true to the negative stereotype, the purveyor of bluster and big-boot football still trailing the noxious fumes of a BBC Panorama investigation?</p> <p>Before <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/28/sam-allardyce-history-suspicion-dream-job-ended-67-days\" title=\"\">his downfall</a> he had showed all the signs of going the way of Steve McClaren. The brash facade quickly gave way to a series of mistakes, the first in cancelling a potentially useful friendly against Croatia followed by errors of selection and tactics and then to an absurd attempt to gloss over his captain\u2019s incoherent performance by claiming that it is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/04/england-slovakia-sam-allardyce-wayne-rooney-world-cup-qualifier\" title=\"\">\u201cnot for me to say where to play Wayne Rooney\u201d</a>. Possibly the most bizarre comment ever made by a serving England manager, this should have put doubts into the minds of the FA even before the news of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/26/sam-allardyce-fa-newspaper-sting-england-manager\" title=\"\">Daily Telegraph\u2019s fatal sting</a>.</p> <p>So now we know. Allardyce was brought down by his failure to recognise the different standards of behaviour demanded by the position he prized so greatly. Those standards were not, after all, so hard to recognise and observe: act with a little discretion and \u2013 just for two years \u2013 rise above the rest of the creatures grubbing around in football\u2019s money pit. Not much to ask, for \u00a33m a year.</p> <p>In the case of Clough, we will never know how it might have turned out. A couple of months after that Switzerland stalemate 39 years ago, having guided England to victories over Luxembourg away and Italy at home in the meantime, Greenwood got the job full-time in preference to Old Big \u2018Ead, whose brand of self-confidence had not impressed the FA\u2019s committee men. Neither were they influenced by his success, in partnership with Peter Taylor, in getting Nottingham Forest promoted to the top flight and by their start \u2013 P18 W12 D3 L3 \u2013 to a season that would see them capturing the First Division title.</p> <p>That was something Greenwood never achieved. But he was an enlightened thinker about the game under whose aegis at West Ham three of England\u2019s heroes of 1966 had grown and prospered, and the FA had let it be known that they were looking for someone who would not just manage the senior international team but take control of the entire England coaching structure. Clough might not have been interested in that aspect of the mission statement. He would also have needed Taylor with him, and together they carried quite a lot of baggage that might have been prised open by the 1970s equivalents of the \u201clads\u201d who did for&#xa0;Allardyce.</p> <p>It is also questionable whether the environment of international football would have suited Clough who, even though his players often did not see him from Saturday night to Friday morning, appeared to thrive best once he had created a kind of family atmosphere. He was a strategist, and international football requires tacticians. Given only short periods of time with his squad, he might also have found it difficult to keep all the big egos&#xa0;happy.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/aug/06/bittersweet-memories-england-argentina-football-conflict-angels-dirty-faces\">Bittersweet memories of England and Argentina where football and conflict collide | Richard Williams</a> </p> </aside>  <p>What we know about Gareth Southgate, who has four matches in which to stake his claim to the job that Clough was never offered, is that he is an intelligent, level-headed and well mannered fellow who rose above his limitations as a player, is ambitious without flaunting it, and seems to be able to learn from his setbacks. What he will need is the vision to evaluate his players and come up with a combination that works. Even half-decent international teams do not require micro-management or a ranting voice from the technical area.</p> <p>If he is unlucky to be without Adam Lallana, Raheem Sterling and Danny Welbeck \u2013 who might easily, if fit and in form, comprise his most effective attacking trio, give or take a Marcus Rashford \u2013 for the matches against Malta and Slovenia, he is fortunate to be coming in near the start of the sort of qualifying campaign from which England managers traditionally emerge unscathed, having given little indication of how they and their players will cope with a real tournament.</p> <p>And if there is to be a long term for Southgate, it should be to his benefit that he has been through the final stages of tournaments held on foreign territory twice in the past 18 months. He will have learned both from the unhappy experience in the European Under-21 Championship <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2015/jun/25/deficit-experience-england-under21s-exit-gareth-southgat\" title=\"\">in the Czech Republic last year</a>, when England came bottom of a strong group, and from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/may/29/england-france-toulon-tournament-final-match-report\" title=\"\">winning the highly competitive Toulon tournament</a> in France this past summer.</p> <p>Sometimes coming in under the radar can be an advantage. Southgate has taken the job on a temporary basis, with few expectations. That will not absolve him from the kind of scrutiny only England managers experience and which, in Brian Glanville\u2019s famous phrase, drives them all mad in the end. But at least the chances are that he will be judged only on the grounds of how well he can get the team to play, and not on the sort of hubristic indiscretions that cast an unflattering light on the whole game.</p>",

There was also bipartisan support for laws to prevent people with mental illness from purchasing guns.\u201d</p> \n<p>These statistics would seem like a better fit for the <a href=\"https://www.hillaryclinton.com/issues/gun-violence-prevention/\">policy platform </a>of his opponent, Hillary Clinton, who actually <a href=\"https://www.hillaryclinton.com/issues/gun-violence-prevention/\">supports</a> expanding federal background check laws to cover private gun sales, including <a href=\"https://www.hillaryclinton.com/feed/33636-reasons-we-need-act-gun-violence/\">private sales at gun shows and online</a>.</p> \n<p>A campaign spokeswoman did not immediately respond to requests for comment.</p> \n<p>The NRA, which just launched a new <a href=\"https://www.nraila.org/articles/20161005/nras-largest-trump-ad-buy-featuring-armed-citizen-kristi-mcmains\">$6.5m pro-Trump television ad campaign</a>, has <a href=\"http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2013/feb/18/nra-says-no-way-members-back-limits/\">repeatedly pushed back</a> against survey results that suggest that even a majority of self-described NRA members favor expanded background checks.

The candidate has been enthusiastic in his praise for the NRA\u2019s leaders, and has repeated the claim that Hillary will \u201cabolish\u201d or \u201cvirtually abolish\u201d the second amendment. Trump has pledged to appoint a supreme court justice who will uphold the court\u2019s pro-gun-rights record, and has endorsed national concealed carry permit reciprocity, a priority for gun rights advocates.

That defies common sense. It also defies the law,\u201d the NRA\u2019s chief lobbyist, Chris Cox, said in an interview after Trump\u2019s comments. Trump <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/744838252369043456?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">later tweeted</a>: \u201cWhen I said that if, within the Orlando club, you had some people with guns, I was obviously talking about additional guards or employees.\u201d </p> \n<p>Trump also suggested in the first presidential debate, as he did after Orlando, that he wanted to block people on government no-fly lists and watch lists from buying guns, a comment that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/27/trump-debate-transcript-issues-facts\">left it unclear</a> whether he might agree more with Hillary Clinton\u2019s position on the issue than with the NRA. Cox said after Orlando that any apparent tension between Trump\u2019s views and the NRA\u2019s position was \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/27/trump-debate-transcript-issues-facts\">a media-created diversion</a>\u201d.</p> \n<p>In August, even gun rights advocates <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/10/trump-assassination-remark-clinton-second-amendment\">criticized Trump\u2019s insinuations of violence</a> when he said, in an offhand remark during a speech, that only \u201csecond amendment people\u201d might be able to do something to stop Hillary Clinton from appointing supreme court justices if she were elected.</p> \n<p>At the NRA\u2019s annual meeting this May, some members were enthusiastic Trump supporters.

  "<p>The death of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/jul/01/geoffrey-hill-one-of-the-greatest-english-poets-dies-aged-84\" title=\"\">Geoffrey Hill this summer </a>put one of his more astringent declarations back into circulation: \u201cAccessible is a perfectly good word if applied to supermarket aisles, art galleries, polling stations and public lavatories, but it has no place in the discussion of poetry and poetics.\u201d Characteristically for Hill, this sounds imperious, but you can\u2019t deny that it\u2019s funny. And it\u2019s funny because the statement embodies the difficulty it\u2019s arguing for \u2013 \u201cdifficulty\u201d not necessarily in the literary sense, where it\u2019s conflated with \u201cobscurity\u201d, but in the sense pertaining to human beings, as in \u201cShe\u2019s quite difficult\u201d, where the word is synonymous with peculiarity, intransigence and eccentricity. Human beings who are difficult are irritating; but their oddity sometimes gives them charm. Hill knows perfectly well that, notwithstanding his abrasiveness, there\u2019s a charm to what he\u2019s saying, because there\u2019s humour&#xa0;in a difficult man\u2019s gestures towards non-cooperation and resistance. \u201cHuman beings are difficult,\u201d he&#xa0;goes on. \u201cWe\u2019re difficult to ourselves; we\u2019re difficult to each other and we are mysteries to ourselves; we are mysteries to each other ... Why is it believed that poetry, prose, painting, music should be less than we are?\u201d</p> <p>What makes poetry \u201cdifficult\u201d? There\u2019s the fact that most poems have no story to outline the experience of reading, no characters to love or hate, no beginning or end in the sense we understand those terms. There is nothing in a poem to cushion us from the encounter with form and language. And form estranges: those short or long lines, one beneath the other, comprise an appearance that\u2019s immediately puzzling. Rhyme helps, as do refrains: they bind the disparate lines. But line endings in a poem constitute a primary strangeness.</p> <p>What about prose? Difficult prose might share some of those features \u2013 the lack of a storybook narrative; the absence of characterisation in an orthodox sense. But what fundamentally makes prose seem difficult will have to do with language itself (compound words, neologisms) and with punctuation (missing commas and full stops). These idiosyncrasies look as if they\u2019re deliberately meant to confuse.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/nov/21/steven-poole-language-power-disarm-concerned-citizen\">Language has the power to disarm the concerned citizen</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Of course, \u201cdifficulty\u201d is subjective. Those who are diverted by the offshoots of 19th-century realism \u2013 the historical novel; fantasy; fiction with a well-rounded plot and characters, and \u201cconflict\u201d \u2013 will find all residues of poetic language and modernism, with some of the features I\u2019ve mentioned, repugnant and boring. On the other hand, addicts of poetry and modernist narrative will find conventional narrative, plot, characterisation and linearity difficult and tedious. According to these addicts, the expunging of punctuation marks from certain works, for instance, is done not to make language difficult; rather it\u2019s a way of unshackling language from the burdensomeness and difficulty of commas, full stops and colons. Some of these addicts might also find what\u2019s generally known as \u201cplot\u201d to be numbingly stultifying, and jettison it in favour of something more open-ended, some quality of narrative which they identify with ease.There\u2019s an ongoing war here, where different people have radically opposed ideas of what\u2019s difficult and resistant and what\u2019s open, accessible and free. Of course, the troops gathered in this battle on the side of immediate accessibility significantly outnumber the fighters in the opposing camp.</p> <p>We live in an epoch in which the battle for the complex and the resistant seems (\u201cseems\u201d is the operative word, as it often is) to have been lost. One of its early casualties was prose style. Style is not just a writer\u2019s personal signature; and yet \u201cclassic style\u201d is an oxymoron, because style is essentially idiosyncratic. Style needn\u2019t necessarily abjure conjunctions, as in<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2005/sep/24/classics.sebastianfaulks\" title=\"\"> Henry Green\u2019s <em>Living</em></a>, or make alienating gestures, such as dispensing with the definite article, as in his <em>Party Going</em>. In fact, style, going back to 19th-century English prose, and adapted by later experimenters such as Virginia Woolf and Henry James, can feel over-punctuated, because it is often syntactically complex and overwrought.</p> <p>Long sentences and intricate syntax are records of either a thought process or a sensory one. They\u2019re as much a feature of prose style in a novelist as they are in a writer of essays. Process can be embodied through thick punctuation \u2013 semicolons, dashes, commas. These signify stops and starts in thought, intakes of breath and revisions in perspective \u2013 they remind us that a sentence might be a single unit, but that it can take various decisions, and embark on different directions, before it reaches its end. Take the third sentence of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2011/aug/10/virginia-woolf-to-the-lighthouse\" title=\"\"><em>To the Lighthouse</em></a>, which comes after Mrs Ramsay has apparently told her son that they\u2019ll make a trip the next morning if the weather holds up and if he\u2019s up early: \u201cTo her son these words conveyed an extraordinary joy, as if it were settled, the expedition were bound to take place, and the wonder to which he had looked forward, for years and years it seemed, was, after a night\u2019s darkness and a day\u2019s sail, within touch.\u201d Structurally, this is a Victorian sentence. But,&#xa0;in a Victorian novel, it would be part of the continual unfolding of the protagonist\u2019s life and ambitions. Woolf\u2019s \u201cnovel\u201d (she wanted another generic name for the work she was composing, according to a letter she wrote at the time) is implicated in a paradox \u2013 it\u2019s about a journey, but it\u2019s also about the shifts of meaning you\u2019re visited by before going nowhere. This is why the syntax of that third sentence asks you immediately to read and then reread it \u2013 because of Woolf\u2019s investment in arresting development and, in lieu of sharing information, altering experience within the sentence.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"235efcc7ea42634ecde4a136e2e3f695e113a30f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/235efcc7ea42634ecde4a136e2e3f695e113a30f/107_0_1446_1445/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Virginia Woolf wanted to use a different generic name for the work she was composing other than \u2018novel\u2019.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Virginia Woolf wanted to use a different generic name for the work she was composing other than \u2018novel\u2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: CSU Archv/Everett / Rex Features</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>A poem might be converted into prose narrative if we transcribe it sideways and remove the line endings: but, as a poem, its form asks us to consider both continuity and that the discrete lines that sit on top of each other be read as separate units that have potentially nothing to do with each other. Similarly, Woolf\u2019s sentence, despite its horizontal appearance, eludes conversion into normal prose and asks to be read as individual units demarcated by commas, each of which has an independent life of its own: \u201cas if it were settled\u201d; \u201cfor years and years it seemed\u201d; \u201cwas\u201d; \u201cwithin touch\u201d. As it happens, the next sentence \u2013 the fourth in the book \u2013 is more than twice as long as the third, an epic eulogy of many commaed sections to this child\u2019s excitement, who, at that moment, is cutting out a picture of a refrigerator \u201cfrom the illustrated catalogue of the Army and Navy stores\u201d. The fifth sentence, on how the boy views the cut-out as a result of his excitement, is unnaturally compressed: \u201cIt was fringed with joy.\u201d These exaggerated alternations, where sentences and their units, astutely marked out by punctuation, have a brief fragmentary life, create, on the first page of <em>To the Lighthouse</em>, a radical idea of \u201cstyle\u201d.</p> <p>One of the reasons style began to be looked upon with disfavour was because it came to be associated with elitism and hubris in a time of disingenuous free-market egalitarianism. A watered-down, moralistic version of anti-intellectualism also possessed Anglophone cultures from the early 1990s, and it frowned upon stylistic \u201cdifficulty\u201d. With style disappeared the semicolon, the colon and dashes, for reasons very different from, say, why Joyce jettisoned punctuation in his so-called stream-of-consciousness flood of words and references \u2013 and the long sentence full of internal variation also became rarer.</p> <p>In Britain, this led in the 90s to the emergence of an undemanding prose in newspapers whose chief characteristic was a friendly blandness: fewer clauses, shorter sentences, light punctuation, a deprecating tendency in the writing not to draw attention to itself. In this period, the semicolon became more or less extinct in Britain, as it did in America. The reasons for the banishment of syntactical complexity from American writing were similar to those in Britain, but in creative writing classes in the US there was also a new minimalism that reigned. It possibly originated with the prestige that Hemingway\u2019s terseness, his muscularity, had had right from the 50s onward; although, at his best, as in \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/nov/27/ten-best-fishing-trips-literature\" title=\"\">Big Two-Hearted River\u201d</a>, Hemingway alternated between the long and oblique and the short and direct: \u201cHe watched them holding themselves with their noses into the current, many trout in deep, fast-moving water, slightly distorted as he watched far down through the glassy convex surface of the pool, its surface pushing and swelling smooth against the resistance of the log-driven spiles of the bridge. At the bottom of the pool were the big trout.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"0dd02a02537ef3d59e4aec3dfbe0114139615df4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0dd02a02537ef3d59e4aec3dfbe0114139615df4/0_452_2103_2103/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ernest Hemingway with his catch.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ernest Hemingway with his catch.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Popperfoto/CPL</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The beauty of the short sentence has to do not with accessibility but distillation, and often, as in this case, with momentary entrancement. This can apply equally to the separate and distinct sections of a long sentence. By the time <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/sep/27/raymond-carver-editor-influence\" title=\"\">Raymond Carver</a> inherited Hemingway\u2019s mantle, there was perhaps not only a fetishisation of terseness in American creative writing classes, but a moralism to do with paring down and curtailment. Only lately have we discovered that Carver often preferred looser, more expansive, sentences, and that<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/dec/05/gordon-lish-books-interview-editing-raymond-carver\" title=\"\"> Gordon Lish</a>, his editor, was responsible for the incarnation which we\u2019re familiar with. Bill Buford coined a term, \u201cdirty realism\u201d, for an issue of Granta in which he showcased Carver and a selection of his contemporaries, including <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2003/feb/08/featuresreviews.guardianreview28\" title=\"\">Richard Ford</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2000/oct/11/fiction.familyandrelationships\" title=\"\">Jayne Anne Phillips</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/jul/19/fiction2\" title=\"\">Tobias Wolff</a>. Once these literary congruences began to be established, the male writers in that group were seen to have descended from Hemingway, although Ford didn\u2019t like Hemingway and adored <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/apr/29/gatsby-great-scott-fitzgerald-greater\" title=\"\">F Scott Fitzgerald</a>, a connoisseur of punctuation and the shape of the sentence, short or long.</p> <p>Late in the 20th century or early in the 21st, Larry Pressler, a Republican senator well-known in India for \u201cpro-India\u201d proclivities, visited Calcutta; he and I had tea with a friend, a scientist, who introduced us to each other. She\u2019d also given him a copy of my book of short stories, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2002/jun/23/fiction.features\" title=\"\"><em>Real Time</em></a>. I remember Pressler, looking through its pages, as mildly struck and amused: \u201cI see you use the semicolon.\u201d After almost a two-decade-long drought in punctuation, it would seem that the semicolon has returned: syntactical complexity began to appear again in Brooklyn in New York City at the start of this millennium. It didn\u2019t originate in the New Yorker, which had cultivated plainness and simple elegance over rebarbative sentence structures. Remember we are speaking of an epoch that was still in the midst of, or just about to emerge from, the philosophical-political arabesque of literary theory. Unintelligible theoretical positions had become embedded in difficult sentences, which were to be found in the pages of Critical Inquiry rather than the New Yorker or the New York Times. Difficulty came not only to be identified with intellectual exploration but with academic expertise. The unobtrusive sentences in the New Yorker were, on one level, fences keeping out theory and protecting, even fetishising, writing as a form of amateurism (ironical for a paper resting on so much capital, and as famous for its extravagant writer\u2019s fees as for its fact-checking). These&#xa0;boundaries were muddled by the appearance of magazines such as n+1.</p> <p>This journal started out as, and still claims to be (a romantic anachronism) a \u201clittle magazine\u201d. It was, in fact, an early reminder that global capital had created \u2013 in America more than in Europe, where the middle class had been more thoroughly possessed by a democratic populism that partnered with the market \u2013 oases of elite education. With them came an American generation that knew where to place the semicolon. Equally, it knew that it knew, and wasn\u2019t nervous about this ability. It had no consistent counterpart in Britain. Most of the editors of n+1 had been educated at Harvard, the rest at \u201cschools\u201d of equal distinc-tion. The American word for higher educational institutions, \u201cschool\u201d, is a reminder that the sort of place Harvard is, and its location in the culture, has no equivalent in Britain: it\u2019s Eton and Oxford in one. Only an institution that saw no conflict between the closely guarded freemasonry one experiences in an elite school and the mass market could have produced Facebook. The editors of, and contributors to, n+1 were, however, seized by an Oedipal urge. They were smart kids; they read both literature and theory with excitement and thoroughness; some of them completed doctorates; but, oddly, unlike their predecessors, they didn\u2019t become academics. This left them free to express their interest in the literary; a fully paid-up academic at the time, engaged in inter-departmental theoretical argumentation, would have considered it beneath themselves to devote their work to literary works and to the question of style and sentences. The n+1 writers, in too irritatingly a smartass way for some, combined \u2013 in editorial columns such as \u201cThe Intellectual Situation\u201d \u2013 politics, theory, literature, criticism and sentences in one space. Their new-found amateurism allowed them this liberty. It also allowed them to wrest back syntactical and intellectual difficulty from the domain of the expert, and make it not incongruent with, or a stranger to, private aesthetic pleasure.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c0fe92291603434d84a0e5a6db53edbe36dbee01\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c0fe92291603434d84a0e5a6db53edbe36dbee01/19_820_2906_1743/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Emily Deschanel as Dr Temperence Brennan in the TV series Bones.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Emily Deschanel as Dr Temperence Brennan in the TV series <em>Bones</em>.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Fox Broadcasting</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But real confirmation of the return of difficulty, and of verbal complexity, is to be found repeatedly in the American television of the past 10 years. It has to do with the recurrence of a certain kind of figure, at once crucial and dispensable, virtuosic and maladroit, in sitcoms and TV dramas. Foremost among these is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/sep/19/the-big-bang-theory-season-10-premiere-bust\" title=\"\">Sheldon Cooper in <em>The Big&#xa0;Bang Theory</em></a>. This sitcom, about four nerdish science graduate students in Pasadena \u2013 a theoretical physicist (Sheldon), an applied physicist (Leonard), an astrophysicist (Raj) and an engineer (Howard) \u2013 showcases Sheldon\u2019s eccentric obsessions in popular culture and especially his simultaneously tortuous and fluent way of communicating with others as a constant source of hilarity. Here\u2019s an example of a typical exchange between Leonard and Sheldon, who share an apartment. Leonard: \u201cYou\u2019ll never guess what just happened.\u201d Sheldon: \u201cYou went out in the hallway, stumbled into an inter-dimensional portal, which brought you 5,000 years into the future, where you took advantage of the advanced technology to build a time machine, and now you\u2019re back, to bring us all with you to the year 7010, where we are transported to work at the think-a-torium by telepathically controlled flying dolphins?\u201d Leonard: \u201cPenny kissed me.\u201d Sheldon: \u201cWho would ever guess that?\u201d (One again sees here, as in the Woolf and Hemingway, the effect of amplification and contraction, of alternating the very long with the very short.)</p> <p>The \u201cdifficulty\u201d of Sheldon\u2019s personality as well as his sentence structures comes from his mix of self-conscious formality and blithe social ineptitude. When, on his first meeting with his girlfriend Amy\u2019s mother, the latter says: \u201cIt\u2019s nice to meet you too Sheldon, I honestly didn\u2019t believe Amy when she told me she had a boyfriend,\u201d Sheldon responds with: \u201cI assure you, I am quite real and I\u2019m having regular intercourse with your daughter.\u201d At the heart of Sheldon\u2019s comic impact is (besides speaking the unspeakable) exaggeration \u2013 the habit of saying in a complicated way what could be said simply \u2013 and this connects his maddening utterances to irony and literature. Irony is ambiguous but funny because it eschews directness and simplicity for subtle prevarication. And exaggeration is near-identical with the literary enterprise, in that literature is not about important things (it leaves those to committees) but about expending unnecessary effort on matters that may or may not be worth it. This can lead to a complexity that\u2019s intrinsically ironical; here\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2004/may/08/classics.vladimirnabokov\" title=\"\">Nabokov, in <em>Pnin</em></a>, describing the protagonist\u2019s background in teaching Russian as we follow his ill-timed arrival into a small university town: \u201cIn the Fall&#xa0;Semester of that particular year (1950), the enrollment in the Russian Language courses consisted of one student, plump and earnest Betty Bliss, in the Transitional Group, one, a mere name (Ivan Dub, who never materialized) in the&#xa0;Advanced, and three in the flourishing Elementary; Josephine Malkin, whose grandparents had been born in Minsk; Charles McBeth, whose prodigious memory had already disposed of ten languages and was prepared to entomb ten more; and languid Eileen Lane, whom somebody had told that by the time one had mastered the Russian alphabet one could practically read \u2018Anna Karamazov\u2019 in the original.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"db9e8edb75e5a19df2528575b0c16ecb352c91d6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/db9e8edb75e5a19df2528575b0c16ecb352c91d6/205_557_1404_842/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Vladimir Nabokov, a writer who \u2018in mid-life became a stylistic virtuoso in a language that was not his mother tongue\u2019.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Vladimir Nabokov, a writer who \u2018in mid-life became a stylistic virtuoso in a language that was not his mother tongue\u2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Carl Mydans/Time &amp; Life Pictures/Getty Image</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There\u2019s a key difference between Nabokov and Sheldon. Both Sheldon and his creators claim that he doesn\u2019t understand irony. This makes almost everything he says sound ironical. It also leads us into a kind of unsettlement. We can\u2019t really be certain if there\u2019s some intended irony in Sheldon\u2019s hyperbole and in the way he\u2019s \u201cdifficult\u201d, and some unintended irony in Nabokov\u2019s. Perhaps some of Sheldon\u2019s faux pas are deliberate; and a few of Nabokov\u2019s tortuous bons mots a personality induced accident? We are in the realm of foreign languages. It\u2019s as if Sheldon were speaking a foreign tongue; certain ordinary aspects of the language \u2013 its emotional registers; simplicity as opposed to bluntness \u2013 are unavailable to him. This is partly because, as a <em>Star Trek</em> aficionado, his first language, into which he lapses occasionally, is Vulcan. He is descended, as an individual and a type, from Spock, one of whose parents came from that planet. Spock\u2019s manner is equitable, calm, intellectual, and objective; his speech is formal and distinct from everyone else\u2019s on the Starship Enterprise. There\u2019s a tendency in us \u2013 because of his detachment \u2013 to think Spock might be an ironicist. He\u2019s foreign, but, unlike Superman, has no \u201cregular\u201d Clark Kent side. As James said of Isabel Archer, an American trying to make her life in England, Spock is \u201cassimilated but unconverted\u201d to human life.</p> <p>In this matter of speaking English as if it were a foreign tongue, we find a convergence between Nabokov and Sheldon; for Nabokov, English was a second language, and the reason David Lodge, in his own somewhat hyperbolic gesture, called him a \u201cliterary genius\u201d was because there \u201cis no other word with which to describe a writer who in mid-life became a stylistic virtuoso in a language that was not his mother tongue\u201d. To be syntactically complex, then, is to be an outsider. It\u2019s also to conflate, in American literary and popular culture, a set of terms \u2013 genius; smartness; the oddity and concealed force of Jewish identity in American life and its language (as in European culture); the unmistakable hint of elitism (Nabokov\u2019s origins lay in the Russian nobility).</p> <p>Since the first issue of n+1 came out in 2004, and Sheldon made his entry in 2007, a number of other characters (all of them secondary to the protagonist except one) who speak strangely and differently have made their appearance on American TV. These include, in the 2009 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/may/16/mondays-best-tv-eating-well-with-hemsley-hemsley-marcella\" title=\"\">series <em>White Collar</em></a>, Mozzie (the name is a homage to the composer Mozart), a gifted, balding, myopic con man who is assistant to the dashing forger, Neal Caffrey. By common consensus, Mozzie \u2013 and not the protagonist \u2013 gets the series\u2019 best lines. Besides exuding a melancholy irony, they\u2019re marked by a dated formality (\u201cWe feel free when we escape, even if it be but from the frying pan to the fire\u201d); aphoristic exaggeration (\u201cLife is more manageable when thought of as a scavenger hunt as opposed to a surprise party\u201d); and literary allusiveness (\u201cI saw the best mind of my generation run down by the drunken taxi cab of absolute reality\u201d). There are others in this lineage: Dr Temperance \u201cBones\u201d Brennan, a forensic anthropologist in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2013/jan/10/bones-your-next-box-set\" title=\"\">eponymous series <em>Bones</em></a>, earnest, pretty, awkward and apt to speak with such stilted exactness that it\u2019s difficult to take anything she says as not being performative; and the secretive billionaire Harold Finch in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2011/may/19/cbs-tv-previews-upfronts\" title=\"\"><em>Person of Interest</em></a> \u2013 again, secondary to, and the brains behind, the vigilante John Reese \u2013 whose utterances always have a deadpan, estranging precision and abnormality. These figures have signalled the reticent resurfacing of the privileged outsider in the cultural domain and, with them, the occasional reintroduction of mannerisms in speech and thinking, of pauses, asides and punctuation, which we thought had once and for all vanished.</p>",

  "<p>\u201cTraingate\u201d seems to have developed as much from Guardian flaws as Guardian strengths.</p> <p>The video of Jeremy Corbyn sitting on the floor of a train, disclosed exclusively online on 16 August, was mistakenly treated by the Guardian more as freelance journalism than what it actually was: a kind of gonzo news release by two Corbyn supporters.</p> <p>The pair did not deal deceitfully with the Guardian. In their terms, the campaigners initially succeeded handsomely in promoting Jeremy Corbyn and his argument for transport policy change.</p> <p>The Guardian was told at the outset that Corbyn had obtained a seat during his journey, but the information was not included in the news report which accompanied the video. Well after it had been established that Virgin Trains staff had organised a seat for Corbyn about 45 minutes into the journey, the original Guardian report still had the erroneous headline \u201cCorbyn joins seatless commuters on floor for three-hour train journey\u201d.</p> <p>Although the Guardian did not intend to mislead readers, that was the effect for some time. Its pre-publication checks and balances failed in some respects. Post-publication, it was not quick enough to fix what it could, and to explain.</p> <p>Had the Guardian done so, the episode may not have generated the controversy which acquired that exhausted suffix, -gate.</p> <p>Had the news report not carried, unexplained, the pseudonymous byline of one of the campaigners, readers may not have felt the need to express concerns to me after reading in Private Eye of his past activism on Corbyn\u2019s behalf.</p> <p>These are my main conclusions after investigating how the initial story was handled. (I do not aim to settle the arguments about how crowded and pre-booked a train must be before it can fairly be called \u201cram-packed\u201d.)</p> <p>Let\u2019s start at the beginning.</p> <p>The freelance film-maker Yannis Mendez is highly regarded by Guardian staff who have worked with him. On 11 August he had a different client. He was being paid by the Jeremy for Labour campaign to make a video record of its work. In that role Mendez was part of the Corbyn entourage on the 11am Virgin Trains East Coast service from London to Newcastle, where Corbyn was to debate challenger Owen Smith.</p> <p>After walking through carriages without finding sufficient seats together, Corbyn sat down on the floor. Mendez described this to me later as \u201ca completely impromptu moment\u201d.</p> <p>Mendez says he filmed while Corbyn delivered straight to camera his message that: many travellers faced this problem daily; the train was \u201cram-packed\u201d; staff were working really hard; more trains were needed; fares were expensive; it was a good argument for public ownership.</p> <p>It lasted less than 30 seconds. I have seen the version Mendez supplied to the Guardian and it is the same as the published version except for the addition by Guardian staff of subtitles to help readers discern Corbyn\u2019s words from the background sound of the moving train.</p> <p>Mendez tells me that it was he who decided to push the footage into the media. He says he told the Corbyn campaign of his intention. According to its co-director, Sam Tarry, the campaign was not given an opportunity to sign off on the package of video, still images and text which was later offered to the Guardian.</p> <p>The video was prepared by Mendez and still images and text were compiled by his friend Anthony Casey, who writes under the name Charles B Anthony and is a passionate Corbyn supporter. Mendez calls him Bobby. Here, we\u2019ll call him Anthony.</p> <p>Anthony was not on the train. Mendez says he phoned Anthony during the journey and Anthony advised him to gather contact details for people also on the train. Anthony later obtained social media posts, two by women who had been photographed on the floor next to Corbyn. From Mendez he received still images of a young couple also sitting on the floor. He gathered screenshots of three tweets dating from 2015: two showed images of crowded trains and one combined an image of George Osborne in a train seat with one of Corbyn standing on a night bus.</p> <p>Around the video and these images Anthony wove almost 500 words in praise of Corbyn, together with quotations from Corbyn. The style is sufficiently apparent from these excerpts:</p> <p>\u201cOvercrowded trains, we\u2019ve all faced them. Crushed up against our fellow commuters, standing in the aisle with a person\u2019s armpit in your face, sitting in the luggage compartment or pitched up next to an overflowing bin. It\u2019s an everyday occurrence for many, but you don\u2019t normally expect to see the leader of the opposition sitting on the floor of a carriage on your way to work.</p> <p>\u201c\u2026 Halfway through the journey the train emptied and Corbyn and his team managed to grab some seats, but before Corbyn could rest comfortably and prepare for his duel with Smith he offered a seat at his table to the gentleman next to him, also without a seat.</p> <p>\u201c\u2026 Jez, keeping it real.\u201d</p> <p>Anthony tells me he prepared the material this way because he had decided to pitch it to Buzzfeed first. When Buzzfeed declined, Mendez contacted the Guardian and offered exclusive use of the video on condition that Charles B Anthony\u2019s article also be accepted.</p> <p>Mendez did not seek payment for himself; he was being paid by the Corbyn campaign. He did raise the issue of a standard freelance payment for Anthony. I\u2019m told by the relevant Guardian staff that no invoice has been received and no payment made. Anthony says he did not seek payment himself and is happy enough to have his byline in the Guardian. Tarry confirmed that the campaign paid Mendez but not Anthony.</p> <p>The Guardian did not think carefully enough about the status of the material being offered, nor the condition attached. By the time the material reached the national news desk it seems to have been assumed that Anthony would get a byline. The acting editor that day, Paul Johnson, was not consulted. Coming from a trusted freelance (Mendez) and accompanied by images and words from a person known to that freelance (Anthony), the material seems to have been viewed more as unpolished journalism than untreated promotion.</p> <p>The result was that the Guardian applied less scepticism and fewer checks than should normally be applied before a news story of this sort is published.</p> <p>Guardian editorial standards necessarily treat differently:</p> <p>\u2022 freelances, who when contracted are bound to the same standards as staff;</p> <p>\u2022 sources, whose motives always need careful weighing, especially if they are to be anonymous;</p> <p>\u2022 pseudonyms \u2013 to be used only exceptionally, with the permission of senior editors, and disclosed to readers;</p> <p>\u2022 material known as \u201cuser-generated content\u201d, often videos made by members of the public at newsworthy events and posted to social media or provided directly to mainstream media outlets.</p> <p>The Guardian\u2019s dealings with Mendez and Anthony can be fitted into several of these categories, but that feels strained. My conclusion is simpler: the pair were acting as unorthodox public relations operatives for a prominent, campaigning politician and their material should have been treated like that.</p> <p>Staff who worked on the story say they did not know that \u201cCharles B Anthony\u201d was a pseudonym or that Buzzfeed had declined the material. Johnson tells me he is concerned the Guardian learns the right lessons from this episode. \u201cWe should always follow our editorial guidelines when considering the use of byline pseudonyms \u2013 if we have prior knowledge. Transparency for the reader is vitally important.\u201d</p> <p>As a freelance, Anthony was an unknown quantity. The desk editor that day, who received Anthony\u2019s copy from Mendez at 11.51am, assigned a staff reporter to work on the material. Anthony and Mendez were contacted. One of the women who had sat with Corbyn and posted about it was interviewed by phone.</p> <p>When the reporter learned that Anthony had not been on the train, doubt was raised with the newsdesk about relying on Anthony\u2019s information. Participants\u2019 recollections differ about how much concern was expressed. Johnson was not consulted. He reaffirmed to me later what the editorial guidelines also emphasise: staff should feel they can express any misgivings about a story.</p> <p>I think the rush-to-publish, which is at once so wonderful and so perilous in journalism, ought to have been slowed. The material was exclusive, so the natural urge to beat the competition was not the factor it may otherwise have been.</p> <p>The desk editor told the reporter to include in the story a disclosure about Mendez working for Corbyn. This was necessary and sensible, as far as it went. But the article was silent about the Charles B Anthony who shared the byline. Anthony\u2019s raw material left no doubt he was a partisan for Corbyn. Readers ought to have been alerted to that fact. About 100 of his words made it into the rewritten article of about 360 words, and although Anthony\u2019s strong promotional tone was reduced, more should have been done for this, a news story.</p> <p>I have followed the Anthony text from its raw state, through the staff reporter\u2019s rewrite, on into the editing stages and finally to its published form (online at 2.59pm on 16 August and on page 4 of the paper on 17 August). The information about Corbyn getting a seat was left out during the staff reporter\u2019s rewrite. The reporter tells me the reasoning was that neither the reporter nor Anthony had been on the train, the aim was to report accurately with the information the reporter had been given, and the copy was focused as much as possible on what could be seen and heard on the video.</p> <p>Even allowing for time pressure, this was a misjudgment. Anthony\u2019s sentence about the Corbyn team getting seats was inaccurate in its reason, about the train emptying halfway, but that sentence put the Guardian on notice that Corbyn did get a seat. More should have been done to verify how and when it happened. Neither Corbyn nor Virgin Trains was contacted pre-publication to check.</p> <p>The desk editor tells me he did not notice the omission.</p> <p>So the online headline was wrong from the outset. It should have been frankly corrected straight after the significance of the omission was realised, which seems not to have occurred until a week later.</p> <p>On 23 August Virgin Trains challenged Corbyn by releasing CCTV footage from the train. The Guardian\u2019s original story was widely and prominently debated across mainstream and social media. Anthony tweeted that day that his original copy for the Guardian had included the fact that Corbyn had managed to get a seat.</p> <p>Next day, online and in its front-page account in the paper, the Guardian reported one of the women who had sat on the floor and been photographed with Corbyn as saying that a seat had become available for him 45 minutes into the trip when staff shuffled people around. That straightened the record, but not as transparently as the Guardian\u2019s role in the controversy required. It was a significant error and should have been expressly corrected as soon as possible, as the editorial guidelines state. Following this review, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/aug/16/jeremy-corbyn-floor-three-hour-train-journey-london-newcastle\">it has been corrected</a>.</p>",
  "<p>\u201cTake back control\u201d is one of those cunning political slogans that can mean whatever you want it to. This summer some people undoubtedly believed they were taking back control of our country\u2019s democracy; however, <a href=\"http://www.transparency.org.uk/publications/take-back-control/\" title=\"\">Transparency International\u2019s research</a> into the money behind the referendum campaigns tells a very different story.</p> <p>In the run-up to the poll both the remain and leave campaigns, alongside smaller outfits like Grassroots Out and Scientists for EU, had to declare any donations they received over \u00a37,500 to the Electoral Commission. These were then <a href=\"http://tinyurl.com/jf3om53\" title=\"\">published online</a>, giving us a fairly good idea of who was bankrolling either side of the debate.</p> <p>Of the \u00a331m in private donations that campaigners declared, half came from just 10 people and private companies. In fact, it took only 12 donors for Vote Leave and seven for the Stronger In Europe campaign to finance the full \u00a37m they were each allowed to spend during the formal referendum period between mid-April and 23 June. So just who was taking control?</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Transparency International has recommended that the UK adopt a \u00a310,000 annual cap on individual and company donations</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>These declarations go a long way towards telling us who really funded the leaflets, letters and adverts that drove home the arguments in the debate, but they also demonstrate some gaping holes in the rules controlling money in UK politics.</p> <p>One of the largest reported donations was made by a company called Better for the Country Ltd. It was registered with Companies House only in the spring of last year, and has yet to publish a set of accounts, so we cannot know for sure how it came to have almost \u00a32m to give to the Grassroots Out campaign.</p> <p>There are very strict rules on who can donate to referendum campaigns in order to prevent foreign influence on UK politics. It may well be that all this money came from sources who were themselves allowed to donate under these rules. But if not, we won\u2019t know until it\u2019s far too late.</p> <p>Although it is shocking to think that the future of our country may have been decided by the deep pockets of so few, this is only part of a wider problem. Our political parties are heavily reliant on a small number of big donors. They might have only the most philanthropic of motivations, but it should be a warning to us all of how vulnerable our democracy is to \u201cpolitical capture\u201d, where public decisions are made to benefit donor\u2019s private interests. It is more subtle than paying a bribe and often entirely legal, but every bit as effective.</p> <p>As our politicians scramble to discover how they lost the public\u2019s trust, they could start by noting the results of our Global Corruption Barometer. In a representative sample of more than 1,000 UK respondents, 28% thought most or all MPs are involved in corruption, and a massive 76% thought wealthy individuals are unduly influencing government to benefit their own interests.</p> <p>Now would be a good time to do something about that. As the government follows up on its commitment from Theresa May\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.ukanticorruptionpledgetracker.org/\" title=\"\">anti-corruption summit </a>to produce the UK\u2019s first anti-corruption strategy, it\u2019s essential that domestic problems are not forgotten in its ambition to provide global leadership on this issue.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/aug/27/may-must-explain-tory-donors-links-to-russia-says-labour-mp\">May must explain Tory donor's links to Russia, says Labour MP</a> </p> </aside>  <p>To start, Transparency International has recommended that the UK adopt a \u00a310,000 annual cap on individual and company donations to political parties and their candidates, as first set out by the Committee on Standards in Public Life, and echoed more recently by the <a href=\"http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld201516/ldselect/ldtupf/106/106.pdf\" title=\"\">cross-party Lords committee</a> examining the government\u2019s proposals for reforming trade unions\u2019 political funds.</p> <p>This measure would reduce political parties\u2019 reliance on a small number of donors \u2013 reducing the influence of any one person \u2013 and push them into spreading their funding base more widely. Whether public money covers any shortfall in the short term is a matter for parliament, but leaving the funding of our politics to so few is dangerous.</p> <p>Turkeys voting for Christmas, you say? Perhaps, but in my past experience as an MP, senior politicians no more wanted to be spending time courting wealthy donors than we want them to.</p> <p>I remember the groans of disbelief at one meeting of MPs where we were encouraged to take inspiration from Democrat congressmen who spend up to four hours a day calling current and prospective donors. That did, however, inspire one Republican earlier this year to introduce legislation known as the <a href=\"http://www.thestopact.com/\" title=\"\">Stop Act</a> to make it illegal for congressmen to ask you for money. It\u2019s still awaiting consideration from a Congressional committee.</p> <p>After the EU referendum, mainstream political leaders were left asking why they had failed to persuade the public to follow them, and what it would take to reconnect. Perhaps the answer lies in the attitudes about corruption and private interests that so many people have towards the political establishment. Whatever happens to our relationship with the EU after the referendum, political parties need to act before trust in politics is irretrievably lost.</p>",

They recognise that supply chains face disruption from the effects of climate change. Carney warned just last month that to minimise the risk to financial stability the transition away from high- carbon industries should begin early and follow a predictable path to help markets anticipate the central element of the Paris agreement: a net zero-carbon economy by the second half of this century.

A shale gas infrastructure would require a return on capital over 30 to 35 years. Quite simply this means that shale gas is an expensive detour the UK can ill-afford to take. That is why last week I announced that the next Labour government will ban fracking, and why community secretary Sajid Javid\u2019s decision this week to overturn 18,000 local objections and clear the way for fracking in Lancashire is a colossal mistake.</p> <p>Gas will play an important transitional role in the UK\u2019s energy supply over the next 15 years. But energy efficiency in domestic heating and the decarbonisation of our power supply by 2030 will see demand for it fall by 26%. </p> <p>We need to be investing in the low-carbon technologies that are creating the apprenticeships and skilled jobs of the future.

Others will see a private artist\u2019s freedom ruined for ever and weep for her. For writers, that\u2019s the trouble with being anonymous. It is difficult to be the right amount.</p> <p>To bring you up to speed: \u201cElena Ferrante\u201d is the nom de plume of an Italian writer (or at least a writer of Italian) whose true identity has been a mystery since her (or his) first novel, Troubling Love, was published in 1991. Until recently the mystery was confined to Italy, where various writers, translators and publishers have been proposed as possible Ferrantes. In the past three years, however, she has become a mythic figure all over the world following the success her Neapolitan novels, about two clever women who grow up poor in postwar Naples.</p> <p>Then, last Sunday, the Italian investigative journalist Claudio Gatti <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/02/elena-ferrante-literary-storm-as-italian-reporter-identifies-author\">published a new theory</a>. By studying public real estate records, he found that a couple connected to Ferrante\u2019s Italian publisher, Edizione E/O, had bought an expensive apartment in Rome in 2000, then another one this summer. Gatti also has documents from an anonymous source that he says show inexplicably large payments from the publisher to one member of the couple, more or less at the time you would expect Ferrante to be getting her big international royalties, and more or less in the right proportions as her sales increased. No one so far has seriously suggested he is wrong. No one likes him, either.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"12388fc7dc060f464638607d2d2e0590ce3dd92c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/12388fc7dc060f464638607d2d2e0590ce3dd92c/0_365_5568_3341/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Two of Elena Ferrante\u2019s Neopolitan novels on sale in a bookshop in Rome\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A mythic figure \u2026 Two of Elena Ferrante\u2019s Neopolitan novels on sale in a bookshop in Rome.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gabriel Bouys/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>You will have noticed that I have not named the person Gatti identifies. In many interviews by email, Ferrante has said that being anonymous is crucial to her writing. \u201cI have gained a space of my own,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/oct/03/elena-ferrante-in-her-own-words-to-relinquish-my-anonymity-would-be-very-painful\">she told Vanity Fair last August</a>, \u201ca space that is free, where I feel active and present. To relinquish it would be very painful.\u201d If so, then Gatti may have strangled any future Ferrante novels, a serious crime if you admire her work. At the very least, he has probably made her suffer.</p> <p>In August 2006, when the Sunday Times was about to expose <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/zoemargolis\">Zoe Margolis</a> as the Girl With a One-Track Mind, whose explicit blogs about her sex life had attracted tens of thousands of readers every day, their acting news editor, Nicholas Hellen, sent her an email. According to Margolis, it explained all the details that identified her, including her mother\u2019s job and address. It added that they had photographed her outside her flat, but the picture was \u201cnot particularly flattering\u201d. \u201cI think it would be helpful to both sides if you agreed to a photo shoot today so that we can publish a more attractive image,\u201d Hellen allegedly said. \u201cWe would expect you to provide your own clothes and makeup. As the story will be on a colour page, we would prefer the outfit to be one of colourful eveningwear.\u201d</p> <p>Margolis cried, and did not answer. \u201cThere was no reason to reveal my identity,\u201d she says now. \u201cNo reason to destroy the anonymity I had, other than to titillate their readers. I\u2019m still disgusted by their completely unjustified behaviour and I stand in solidarity with other writers who have gone through similar experiences.\u201d <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2006/aug/11/gender.booksonhealth\">Months of fallout followed</a>.

He was the police officer behind <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/apr/24/orwell-prize-jack-night-winner-blog\">NightJack</a>, which won the Orwell blogging prize in 2009. Like Margolis, he had begun writing anonymously because it let him be truthful without damaging his life. Like Margolis, he never planned to reveal who he was. Then he was exposed by the Times \u2013 in his case, because <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/jan/17/times-reporter-hacked-nightjack-email\">his email was hacked</a>. \u201cWe had photographers camped outside the door and people trying to phone me at home,\u201d says Horton. The experience scared his wife and children. \u201cWe had to go away for a few days until things died down. I regret what happened to them as a result of my identity coming out more than anything else.\u201d</p> <p>Legally, Ferrante has no good options. As an Italian, which Gatti says she is, she would have \u201cthe right to respect for her private and family life\u201d under <a href=\"http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1998/42/schedule/1/part/I/chapter/7\">Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights</a>. In order to bring a claim against Gatti or his publishers, however, she would need to demonstrate specifically that she had a \u201creasonable expectation of privacy\u201d in relation to her real name. \u201cI don\u2019t think that public interest justifies the exposure,\u201d says Jeremy Clarke-Williams, a specialist in privacy and defamation law at Slater and Gordon, \u201cbut I don\u2019t think we reach that stage, because I don\u2019t think Elena Ferrante would be able to show that she had a reasonable expectation of privacy.\u201d Gatti sharing details of her finances might put her on stronger ground, but she would only lose more privacy by going to court. \u201cIf she wants this to go away,\u201d Clarke-Williams says, \u201cor quieten down at least, it\u2019s probably better for her to do nothing, rather than launch a court case where the media can sit back and enjoy the show.\u201d</p> <p>It is interesting that writers cannot \u201creasonably expect\u201d to keep their names unpublished, given how many have down the years. Daniel Defoe published as Robinson Crusoe, Jonathan Swift as Lemuel Gulliver (with phoney portrait). Aphra Behn published pseudonymously. So did Henry Fielding. Samuel Richardson was anonymous and Jane Austen was just \u201ca Lady\u201d. Horace Walpole, all three Bront\u00ebs and George Eliot all had noms de plume, and Eliot\u2019s stuck. Even today, the famously anonymous are everywhere you look. There\u2019s the world-famous artist Banksy, and one of the world\u2019s most famous computer scientists, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/dec/09/bitcoin-creator-satoshi-nakamoto-craig-wright\">Satoshi Nakamoto</a>, who invented bitcoin (and is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/may/03/craig-wright-bitcoin-founder-claim-labelled-scam-satoshi-nakamoto\">probably not Craig Wright</a>).

That was hard. To be so proud of something and not be able to share it is quite tough.\u201d The technical aspects are scarcely any easier. Brooke Magnanti is a research scientist who blogged as the call girl Belle de Jour until 2009 when, fearing that her identity was about to be revealed in a newspaper, she <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2009/nov/15/belle-de-jour-blogger-prostitute\">revealed it herself</a> in a different one. She had managed six years of anonymity under intense pressure, and <a href=\"https://maggiemcneill.wordpress.com/resources/blog-archives/brooke-magnanti/how-to-blog-anonymously-and-how-not-to\">her own guide to online privacy</a> shows it wasn\u2019t luck.</p> <p>Highlights of the Magnanti method include: changing your email account twice a year and knowing which providers to avoid; knowing how to remove metadata from text documents and media files; learning how to use VPNs and Tor, and how to tell if your IP address is accessible; setting yourself up as a silent partner in a new company run by your accountant.

It centres on Ferrante\u2019s new book \u2013 not a novel, but a collection of letters, essays and other pieces of nonfiction called <a href=\"http://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/464300/frantumaglia-by-elena-ferrante/9781609452926\">Frantumaglia</a>. According to its publisher, it \u201canswers many of her readers\u2019 questions\u201d, but if Gatti is right, some of the answers are lies \u2013 specifically that Ferrante\u2019s mother was a Neapolitan seamstress who spoke the Naples dialect, and that Ferrante herself grew up in the city until she \u201cran away\u201d. He also contends that she is lying with a purpose: \u201cThese crumbs of information seemed designed to satisfy her readers\u2019 appetite for a personal story that might relate to the Neapolitan setting of the novels themselves.\u201d</p> <p>To unmince those words, Gatti is saying that Ferrante wants people to believe she rescued herself through education from the slums of Naples, just as the Elena in her novels does. If people believe this, it would make the novels more than just the story of a woman overcoming poverty and patriarchy; it would make them an example of it happening for real. Seen this way, buying Ferrante becomes a kind of vote for feminism, and attacking her almost a vote against it; thus concocted sisterliness, not literary quality, explains the books\u2019 success.</p> <p>Whatever you believe, I\u2019m sure there\u2019s no need to explain why a man implying this would raise such fierce feelings. Even at the best of times there is a widespread view that female novelists are considered great more grudgingly than male ones. In any case, Gatti does not get close to proving that Ferrante had a scheme to deceive her readers, and proof is meant to matter to investigative journalists. Certainly, Ferrante is no Rahila Khan.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/higher-education-network/2016/sep/02/my-dirty-little-secret-ive-been-writing-erotic-novels-to-fund-my-phd\">My dirty little secret: I've been writing erotic novels to fund my PhD</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Who? In 1987, Virago published Down the Road, Worlds Away, a book of stories by a little-known British Muslim woman. Khan\u2019s work, mostly about the hardship of Asian teenagers in modern Britain, had been broadcast on BBC Radio and much praised. An article in the Times Educational Supplement said that her first story \u201calmost persuaded me that literature still has some relevance to life\u201d.</p> <p>Khan was shy about her fame, perhaps not surprisingly, although she took her shyness awfully far, never meeting or even speaking to her radio editor, her publisher or even her agent. There turned out to a simple explanation. She was the Reverend Toby Forward, an Anglican vicar in Brighton who believed that fiction by vicars wasn\u2019t taken seriously. When Virago found out, they were outraged, and withdrew the book from sale. Forward now writes children\u2019s books, and has always argued, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/13/lionel-shrivers-full-speech-i-hope-the-concept-of-cultural-appropriation-is-a-passing-fad\">as Lionel Shriver did so shockingly</a> at the Brisbane Writers festival last month, that fiction writers are supposed to imagine being other people. That doesn\u2019t mean you get it right, however. For instance, he imagined that Virago wouldn\u2019t mind.</p> <p>Ferrante has no need to justify her anonymity. She can do whatever works for her. Interestingly, Clarke-Williams thinks that not even proven hypocrisy on her part would legally justify her exposure in the public interest. \u201cAll she\u2019s doing is writing fiction which has struck a chord, and she may or may not have had the personal experience \u2026 I think a writer of fiction is expected to make things up!\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"224cbf93747e9dcd3b2f98b49688832e7af50b27\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/224cbf93747e9dcd3b2f98b49688832e7af50b27/1168_0_1598_1997/800.jpg\" alt=\"The late Harper Lee never hid her identity, but did manage to stay out of the public eye for much of her life\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The late Harper Lee never hid her identity, but did manage to stay out of the public eye for much of her life.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Even so, it is worth considering her other choices. JD Salinger, Harper Lee and Thomas Pynchon have all shown that novelists need not conceal their names in order to be little-known. On the contrary, by making her identity a secret, Ferrante inevitably made it much more interesting, not least because it gave people cause to wonder whether she had something autobiographical to hide. She seems to have been drawn into all those interviews in an effort to explain herself.</p> <p>She has mentioned being inspired by Jane Austen, whose anonymity \u201cmade a great impression on me as a girl of 15\u201d, but <a href=\"https://blog.longreads.com/2016/09/01/how-the-brontes-came-out-as-women\">Charlotte Bront\u00eb</a> is instructive, too. She published Jane Eyre as Currer Bell, with her sisters Emily and Anne being Ellis and Acton. Besides being \u201caverse to personal publicity\u201d, they had chosen pseudo-male names because of \u201ca vague impression that authoresses are liable to be looked on with prejudice\u201d; indeed, rather than spending all its energy on Jane Eyre, the world spent much more on guessing who Currer Bell was, and especially which sex. This just made Charlotte more reluctant to reveal herself, which was torture when she realised that several of her literary heroes \u2013 Dickens, Thackeray, Martineau \u2013 were eager to meet her if she would just drop by. By the time her next novel, Shirley, was published, she was worried that her mail would be opened at the local post office. (A reminder that hacking was not invented with computers.) In the end, she gave in.</p> <p>The point then, as now, as always, is that you can\u2019t seek attention for your work and hope that none seeks you. You can\u2019t choose absence. You can only choose to be yourself, or to be a mystery, and people who don\u2019t love mysteries cannot love novels either. Besides, of course it matters who the author is, at least eventually. Otherwise there could still be someone saying that Middlemarch, Jane Eyre, even Pride and Prejudice, were too good to be written by a woman.</p>",

(Humanise yourself; practise the controlled release of information; never answer questions with a simple yes or no, because this can be manipulated into a recorded confession.) Ollie is referred to by another instructor as the \u201cshort-haired hippy\u201d, and at one point I spot a whiteboard on which he has written: \u201cWhen ego is lost, universality exists.\u201d Jason and Ollie run <a href=\"http://break-point.com\">Break-Point</a>, a company that teaches special forces techniques on corporate awaydays, which I would happily pay to watch.</p> <p>Then there\u2019s Mark \u201cBilly\u201d Billingham, grizzled, blue-eyed and scary, the sort of man I imagine Gordon Ramsay fantasises about being.

If you see a broken column, there\u2019s an enemy less than 18 to 20 minutes ahead of you \u2013 which is how long it takes the ants to reform.\u201d Billy teaches us that immersion in the jungle eventually makes your skin reek of urine, due to the production of ammonia, \u201cbut you start to blend into your surroundings.

Contestants simply try to endure: evading capture, rescuing casualties, being subjected to surprise interrogations and mind games, supporting each other through pain. Like Billy, many are aiming to turn their lives around, or overcome traumatic experiences. One contestant in the new series signed up after his son was killed in Afghanistan, having recently begun his own SAS training. Another, a young British Muslim who has suffered racist attacks, wants to prove himself as a role model.

It is 35C, the humidity 95%. I stumble over branches and snag myself on thorns, to the irritation of my captors.

These are unnatural poses in which one\u2019s bodyweight is balanced on single muscles or joints \u2013 holding a deep squat for long periods, for instance. Even keeping my arms above my head proves agonising after 10 minutes. Threats are whispered in Spanish while my body convulses with pain. I\u2019ve reached my limit. Today I have hung from ropes surrounded by hornets, holding my entire bodyweight until my arms crumpled. I\u2019ve scrambled up banks through thick vegetation. There are vines to support me when both legs fail, but they bring the palms up in stinging boils, prompting a tricky cost/benefit analysis.

I can remember neither the mission I am supposed to be on (something about reconnaissance on a drug plant), nor the cover story we invented. I know I have some names and coordinates on a square of notepaper tucked under my testicles, which I don\u2019t want anyone to go looking for. Even when the hood is lifted and I find I am kneeling at the edge of a shallow grave, I give nothing away. The two men seem impressed by my resilience. The reality is that my brain has checked out. Yet I\u2019ve been here only one day; the real competitors endure this quasi-torture for three sleepless days, spending 10 days in all pushed to their limits; when Foxy, Ollie and Billy went through real SAS selection, they did this for six months.</p> <p>Reality TV can never replicate these former soldiers\u2019 experiences. In the first season of Who Dares Wins, Foxy revealed he was discharged from the SAS after suffering from PTSD. How does he feel about military training being mined for entertainment? \u201cIt\u2019s education and exploration first,\u201d he says, thoughtfully. \u201cIt\u2019s about showing people that our humanity gets us through tough moments, not about being tough.

Back in the UK, after my arms and legs and face have recovered, I find myself mentally reliving the few moments when I didn\u2019t let myself down. Scaling a tower of logs and throwing myself into deep brown water from the top. Accurately recalling the location of our camp when questioned, out of breath and disoriented. Spying the kidnappers early, gaining a time advantage and having the confidence to brave the bush. Even if it was just for a minute, I freed myself. I am left with an entirely unexpected feeling: pride.</p> <p>A few months later, I am turning into one of the people I hate. Someone who does exercise, and even worse, talks about it. I\u2019ve started running, and swimming. I\u2019ve started running around my local park. On holiday in France I circumnavigated a lake, clearing 8km without realising it, then 10km. I\u2019m wondering about a half marathon. It helps clear negative thoughts, gives me a sense of self-reliance, a scale of achievements I can be in control of reaching.</p> <p>I finally understand the value of exercise, and all it took was a simulated kidnapping and some piranhas.

  "<p>\u201cHe was unique, totally unique,\u201d Pep Guardiola <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/mar/24/johan-cruyff-revolutionary-changed-football-richard-williams\" title=\"\">says of Johan Cruyff</a> on a quiet Thursday afternoon in London. \u201cWithout him I wouldn\u2019t be here. I know for sure this is why I am, right now,<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/aug/10/pep-guardiola-manchester-city-barcelona-xavi\" title=\"\"> the manager of Manchester City</a> and before that Bayern Munich and Barcelona.\u201d</p> <p>On a sofa tucked away in a Bloomsbury hotel, the intensity of Guardiola\u2019s gaze sharpens the impact of these words about his former coach and mentor. \u201cBefore he came we didn\u2019t have a cathedral of football, this beautiful church, at Barcelona. We needed something new. And now it is something that has lasted. It was built by one man, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/sep/12/johan-cruyff-louis-van-gaal-manchester-united\" title=\"\">by Johan Cruyff</a>, stone by stone. That\u2019s why he was special.</p> <p>\u201cI would not be able to do what he did. You hear all these people saying: \u2018Oh Pep, what a good manager he is.\u2019 Forget about it. Cruyff was the best, by far. Creating something new is the difficult part. To make it and build it and get everyone to follow? Amazing. That\u2019s why, when I was Barcelona manager, I&#xa0;went to see Johan many times. I made especially sure I went a lot in my first year when we won everything, absolutely everything.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/mar/25/johan-cruyff-father-modern-game-dutch\">Johan Cruyff: father of modern game who also shaped Dutch culture | David Winner</a> </p> </aside>  <p>At the end of that 2008-09 season, when Guardiola was 37 and after he had spent the previous year, his first as a coach, looking after their B team, <a href=\"http://www.zonalmarking.net/2010/03/24/barcelona-2008-09-pep-guardiola-4-3-3/\" title=\"\">Barcelona completed the treble</a> of the Copa del Rey, La Liga and the Champions League \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ost90DnkjOA\" title=\"\">beating Manchester United 2-0</a> in the final. Guardiola\u2019s reputation was sealed during that extraordinary managerial debut but he stresses: \u201cI always went that season to see Johan to try to make him feel how grateful I was to him. Of course I wanted to talk to him about new ideas, but the main feeling I always had when I said goodbye was that he might feel how pleased I am and see how deep my gratitude goes.\u201d</p> <p>That same gratitude means Guardiola is attending <a href=\"https://www.panmacmillan.com/books/my-turn-the-autobiography\" title=\"\">the launch of Cruyff\u2019s autobiography</a>, which the Dutchman finished working on shortly before <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/mar/26/johan-cruyff-1974-world-cup-donald-mcrae\" title=\"\">his death from cancer, at the age of 68, just over six months ago</a>. It\u2019s also the reason why Guardiola is willing to engage in a rare interview, during an afternoon when he and I will share a stage with Jordi Cruyff, Johan\u2019s son and his Barcelona team-mate in the 1990s.</p> <p>While his bond with Cruyff Sr grew into one of the strongest in European football, Guardiola is still amused by the fact that when he first played for Cruyff the Dutch master gave him a severe rollicking at half-time. \u201cYou were slower than my granny,\u201d Cruyff told the teenage Guardiola. Repeating Cruyff\u2019s insult makes him chuckle. \u201cThat\u2019s true,\u201d Guardiola says, \u201cit really is.\u201d</p> <p>At the age of 18 in May 1989, did he accept Cruyff\u2019s jibe in a light-hearted way? \u201cNo. I was in a bad way because it was my first friendly in the first team. It was in the summer against a team [Banyoles] in the third division. I wanted to play the second half and Cruyff said: \u2018No.\u2019 Just like that. I sat there and thought: \u2018Never again will I play for the first team at Barcelona. It\u2019s over.\u2019</p> <p>\u201cI didn\u2019t understand it then. This was how Johan Cruyff worked. He was demanding a lot, but when you got there, and you were in his team, he was an incredible protector. He would push and push you and then he would protect you. He was a master at handling players. He knew when you needed to be pushed or protected.\u201d</p> <p>It took Guardiola another 19 months before, finally, he made his La Liga debut for Barcelona. He speaks of the need he and other young players felt to make Cruyff notice them. \u201cEvery step you make he helps you realise why you are getting better. He teach me how I can get better. I am like this: \u2018I want more and more.\u2019 You can feel the desire in me to get better.</p> <p>\u201cThis is not the same as being hungry to make it. We all feel that hunger in football. With Cruyff it was different. He deepened and changed the hunger so you became conscious of why you are getting better. It was often simple. He would shout at me: \u2018Control with the left, control with the left!\u2019 because in the beginning I only use my right foot. He made me use both feet. Even now I use this with my players.</p> <p>\u201cBut he had such vision. That\u2019s why I called him many times to get his thoughts when I had the idea of moving into coaching.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a0414a5980774a7a3f1f6fbb23f5a88b5088ce73\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a0414a5980774a7a3f1f6fbb23f5a88b5088ce73/0_0_5472_3648/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Pep Guardiola during the launch of Johan Cruyff\u2019s My Turn.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Pep Guardiola during the launch of Johan Cruyff\u2019s My Turn.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tom Jenkins for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In his book Cruyff recalls advising Guardiola that a good manager tells his chairman or president to stay out of the dressing room. Guardiola laughs. \u201cYes, he did. But at that time the Barcelona president was a great friend of Johan and so it wasn\u2019t a problem. We also spoke about how to handle the team on and off the pitch. But we didn\u2019t always talk about football. We spoke about ordinary life.\u201d</p> <p>I also talk to Guardiola about ordinary life after fate intervenes. A flight from Barcelona carrying Danny Cruyff, Johan\u2019s wife of 48 years, has been delayed and so there is an unexpected 40 additional minutes with Guardiola before we start our formal engagements. This relaxed snapshot ends up being just as intriguing, at least to me, as any antipathy he might once have felt towards Jos\u00e9 Mourinho or his clinical jettisoning of Joe Hart.</p> <p>As soon as Guardiola arrives, accompanied by his brother, Pere, the influential agent whose clients include Luis Su\u00e1rez, it feels easy to chat to him. It helps that Guardiola breaks into a smile when I ask him how he travelled down from Manchester. \u201cBy train,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s perfect and the second time I\u2019ve caught the train to London. I worked all the way and before I knew it I was in the heart of London.\u201d</p> <p>Guardiola talks enthusiastically about England, from the amount of sunshine he\u2019s seen in Manchester \u2013 \u201cI know the rain is coming but, so far, it\u2019s been amazing\u201d \u2013 to his affection for London, before remembering his rigorous sabbatical when he was between positions at Barcelona and Bayern Munich. The zeal with which Guardiola recalls \u201cmany hours of homework\u201d while learning to speak German in New York merges into a lofty appreciation of the language. Guardiola is almost poetic in describing how, once you move beyond the harsh cadences a foreigner hears, \u201cthe beauty of German surprised me\u201d.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I knew nothing about football before knowing Cruyff</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>I am surprised, in turn, by Guardiola. The publishers have arranged a couple of cars to take us to Waterstones but Guardiola looks out at a sunny October scene. \u201cWhy don\u2019t we just walk there?\u201d he says. This seems typical of Guardiola\u2019s mood as we make the short walk to Tottenham Court Road, receiving a few wide-eyed stares from people wondering if a Pep Guardiola lookalike might be out for a stroll. There is a kind of freedom, Guardiola says, in an international week for a club manager, a time to breathe again.</p> <p>He soon breathes fresh life into the legacy of the man he reveres when, at the conference, I ask him about his quote on the book\u2019s beautiful Dutch\u2011orange cover: \u201cI knew nothing about football before knowing Cruyff.\u201d</p> <p>Guardiola is suitably expansive. \u201cI thought I knew about football but when I started to work with him a new world appeared in front of me. Not just me \u2013 but a whole generation of players. Johan helped us understand the game. Football is the most difficult game in the world because it is open and every situation is completely different and you have to make decisions minute by minute. But I was a lucky guy. I am sitting here now because I met him. If not for him it would not have been possible.\u201d</p> <p>The book is illuminating in revealing how, when he was 18 and the youngest member of Ajax\u2019s first team, Cruyff discussed tactics with his coach, Rinus Michels. They became synonymous with Total Football. \u201cI also did it with Johan when I was 18 and I didn\u2019t know anything about Michels,\u201d Guardiola points out. \u201cBut at 18 you are a student, you are a child, not just in terms of the tactics and the mental approach but how they teach you every single day.&#xa0;Johan was part of our training sessions. He was not sitting there. Johan loved formations and he played with us in the boxes, in the games.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"61cc91497371e10adaeb55fb058a60f646ce1601\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/61cc91497371e10adaeb55fb058a60f646ce1601/22_60_2833_1700/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Pep Guardiola holds his medal aloft in front of Johan Cruyff after Barcelona\u2019s European Cup win in 1992.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Pep Guardiola holds his medal aloft in front of Johan Cruyff after Barcelona\u2019s European Cup win in 1992.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mark Leech/Offside</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I\u2019ve heard that Cruyff, even as a coach, played beautifully on the training pitch. \u201cBetter than us,\u201d Guardiola exclaims of himself and his fellow players in Barcelona\u2019s Dream Team that won the club\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xxtk6EnNB10\" title=\"\">first European Cup at Wembley in 1992</a>. \u201cHe was much, much better than us. He explained what we have to do and showed us how to do it. It was a masterclass every single training session, every single game, analysing why we play good or bad. It was like going to university every day.</p> <p>\u201cHe was the most influential person in football history. He changed not one club. He changed two clubs \u2013 as a player and a coach. It\u2019s impossible to find another guy like this. OK, he did it at Ajax and they won the European Cup when Michels was there \u2013 but the player was Johan. After that he was a coach there and then he came to Barcelona. It was a big club but it didn\u2019t have a specific football culture. We had one Argentina coach who played an Argentinian style, then came a German coach who played a German style. But then Johan arrived and he said: \u2018Guys, now we play this way.\u2019</p> <p>\u201cWhen I was there you see seven\u2011year-old kids doing the same training session, with the same patterns, as the first team. He created something from nothing and you have to have a lot of charisma and personality. Everybody knows about football but you need the charisma to say: \u2018You must go in that way,\u2019 and everybody follows. That\u2019s so difficult to find.\u201d</p> <p>When Cruyff first discussed tactics with him, and Guardiola was in his teens, was he intimidated? \u201cOf course. I was scared. Really scared. It was so tough. I\u2019m sorry, Jordi.\u201d</p> <p>He looks across at Cruyff\u2019s son and they laugh again. \u201cIt was so tough, so demanding. But after he retired I met him as a coach myself and he was a grandfather. He was completely different. He was so kind and, like the book expresses so well, a person who lives for other people, he tries to help. <a href=\"http://www.cruyff-foundation.org/en/\" title=\"\">He had his foundation</a> when I went there. I felt he was happy.</p> <p>\u201cHe was the most courageous coach and manager I ever met. When he smells the talent it doesn\u2019t matter if the age is 16 or 17 because he believed in, what in Spain we call, the <em>efecto mariposa</em> [butterfly effect]. For him one good pass at the beginning could create absolutely everything.\u201d</p> <p>Cruyff loved mathematics because it helped him think in new ways about formations and finding space in football \u2013 just as other sports such as basketball and, in particular, baseball, opened his mind. Does Guardiola look closely at other sports? \u201cI love it. I love golf. Basketball. All sports.\u201d Did he watch the Ryder Cup? \u201cYeah. We are waiting to get our revenge in two years.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"f859e2e7fabfac8ebd07e31041066a29424f9322\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f859e2e7fabfac8ebd07e31041066a29424f9322/52_22_2262_3183/711.jpg\" alt=\"Johan Cruyff with Pep Guardiola at the 2006 ProAm Mallorca Classic golf.\" width=\"711\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Johan Cruyff with Pep Guardiola at the ProAm Mallorca Classic golf tournament in October 2006.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Monserrat/Marca/Offside</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Guardiola smiles just as easily when I point out that he made Cruyff\u2019s all\u2011time Fantasy Football XI. \u201cAs normal,\u201d he quips. Yet, in an imaginary attack led by Pel\u00e9 and Maradona, Cruyff could not find space for Lionel Messi. \u201cIf it was me I would pick Messi,\u201d Guardiola says. \u201cBut I spoke to Johan many times about Messi. You cannot imagine how he admired him, how he liked him, how he loved him.\u201d</p> <p>Cruyff writes in his book that his life had been so intense and fulfilled it felt as if he had lived through a hundred years. Does Guardiola believe people will still talk about the Dutchman\u2019s influence on football in 50 years? \u201cThere is no doubt about that. People always talk about the best managers, talking about prizes, how many titles, but that\u2019s a huge mistake. The best managers win lots of titles because we are at big clubs with big players. But it is about how they influence the new generation, how they influence their players. At Ajax Cruyff influenced players like [Marco] Van Basten, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2005/feb/19/newsstory.championsleague\" title=\"\">[Frank] Rijkaard and others</a>. They became coaches and many players&#xa0;from Barcelona are coaches right now. The influence on all of us was, wow, outstanding, amazing, huge. It\u2019s not comparable to anyone because he was&#xa0;special.\u201d</p> <p>Jordi Cruyff is visibly moved and, seeing his mother and sister in the audience, his voice cracks as he thanks his father\u2019s ghostwriter, Jaap de Groot, and, \u201calso, Pep. If my father could choose one person to sit beside him I am quite sure it would be Pep. I can assure you my father was a big fan of Barcelona but also of Bayern Munich and in these last years, if he could still watch football, I think he\u2019s probably going to be a big Manchester City fan.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I am not here to change the Premier League \u2026 my team is going to play the way I believe in</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Pep and Jordi clasp hands like they have completed a circle that began all those years ago.</p> <p>\u201cIt was emotional, yes,\u201d Guardiola says 15 minutes later as, along with Pere, we head out the back entrance and walk along some side streets.

I\u2019m not sure whether they still say that.</p> <p><strong>I feel there\u2019s an underlying racism in the US \u2013 many people see guns as a way of protecting themselves.</strong> Plus, you have the combined issue of terrorism. There\u2019s now an us and them mentality. In the US, people are paranoid about Muslims and people of colour. It\u2019s in the psychology. Also if you look back to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/dec/14/obama-meaningful-action-newtown-shooting\">Sandy Hook</a>, I believe the National Rifle Association spoke out and said that, if the teachers had been armed, the shootings wouldn\u2019t have happened.

I found that fascinating. None of the parents said \u2018if we didn\u2019t have guns, this wouldn\u2019t have happened\u2019. They mentioned other factors such as poverty and environment. Sadly, gun crime and murder happen every single day and it becomes part of the fabric of everyday life.</p> <p><strong>The talk also made me ask myself what I can do to help.</strong> I wish I had asked Gary what more we can do as individuals.

  "<p>Last year a committee of county councillors from Lancashire dealt with one of the biggest planning applications ever put before any council, as they considered Cuadrilla\u2019s applications to drill and frack for shale gas in two rural locations between Preston and Blackpool.

Nor am I going to address the broader concerns about finding a new way to take fossil fuels from under the Earth to satisfy our need for energy.</p> <p>What I do know is that those councillors called upon to make the decision, locally elected representatives of the people of Lancashire, took their responsibilities in considering these applications very seriously and exercised their duty to the best of their abilities. And, crucially, that is what local democracy should be about: local people making decisions about the big issues that affect them.</p> <p>One of the key themes promoted by central government in recent years has been localism, promoting the advantages of devolving power to communities up and down the country.</p> <p>Here in Lancashire we have embraced that theme, working hard to support the local enterprise partnership in acting as a catalyst for economic growth and, despite a hugely complex local government landscape, making strides towards establishing a combined authority that will see councils working together with the promise of more control over issues that affect the county as a whole, such as skills, transport and the economy.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9ffc671bf40e9b66bb1c17800e2f4e83d4c6239d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9ffc671bf40e9b66bb1c17800e2f4e83d4c6239d/0_117_3018_1810/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sajid Javid\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sajid Javid. \u2018The council asked the government to lift the covers off a heavily redacted report about the potential impact of shale-gas exploration on rural communities.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Carl Court/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It is right and proper that this country\u2019s planning regime enables applicants to appeal against decisions that go against them. And as part of that process, the secretary of state has long had the power to recover the final decision.</p> <p>However, it is easy to understand the frustration felt by those who opposed the applications, and now find their local representatives <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/oct/06/uk-fracking-given-go-ahead-as-lancashire-council-rejection-is-overturned\" title=\"\">overruled by the secretary of state</a> \u2013 a member of a government that has made very clear its determination to see shale gas exploited on a large scale.</p> <p>Throughout this process, Lancashire county council has sought to consider these applications on their merits, according to planning guidance and law. Moreover, county councillors have more than once united to acknowledge that \u2013 wherever each councillor stands on the safety of fracking or the use of fossil fuels \u2013 many of our residents have genuine concerns.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>This is what local democracy should be about \u2013 local people making decisions about the big issues that affect them</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>That is why the council has twice formally called on the government to establish industry-specific regulation. It is why the council asked the government to lift the covers off a heavily redacted report about the potential impact of shale-gas exploration on rural economies. And it is why the council asked the government not to take planning decisions out of local hands.</p> <p>Residents and businesses in Lancashire mobilised themselves on this issue; their councillors listened carefully to what they and the applicant had to say. The subsequent overturning of three of those councillors\u2019 decisions not only underlines the theory that localism applies only when it suits the centre. It highlights the chasm that exists between people seeking answers and a government that is either unwilling or unable to provide them.</p>",

An intriguing clash in the first half, but it arguably failed to really hit the heights we perhaps expected from two such potentially entertaining and attacking sides.</p> <p>Coach John Aloisi with some very strong opinions as to referee Evans\u2019 performance tonight \u2013 he\u2019s perhaps hoping he\u2019ll receive a week\u2019s grace fine-wise from FFA because he\u2019s really gone to town: \u201cI was very disappointed with the referee tonight; he\u2019s a professional contracted referee, but his performance just wasn\u2019t good enough\u201d.</p> <p>Brisbane perhaps aggrieved to see their captain McKay sent off in his landmark 200th game, but in all honesty they don\u2019t have too much basis for complaint. Yes, the first yellow was perhaps harsh, but to tug an opponent back knowing you\u2019ve been cautioned was pretty reckless from the skipper.</p> <p>Victory for their part looked bright from the outset, but perhaps didn\u2019t create enough for Besart Berisha, who had a quiet evening \u2013 especially on his return to Suncorp.</p> <p>Holman and Kristensen looked impressive for the hosts, so positive signs for them, with Tommy Oar\u2019s cameo also showing he appears to be back to his full powers.</p> <p>Some carelessness in possession however. A rusty first offering from both sides perhaps, but definitely solid signs that these two teams could feature prominently in the end-of-season run-in.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57f77e90e4b0e4aaeaa8cde1\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-07T10:54:16.275Z\">11.54am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Some pretty long faces on the Victory bench, but it\u2019s all smiles among Brisbane supporters.</p> <p>Your final thoughts on that dramatic finale?</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57f77e0ae4b03258bcac5421\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-07T10:52:42.049Z\">11.52am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Full-time: Brisbane Roar 1-1 Melbourne Victory</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>And that\u2019s that!</p> <p>You\u2019d be a brave Roar supporter to suggest you saw that coming!

  "<p>Britons who have settled overseas permanently are to be given a \u201cvote for life\u201d in British general elections, the government has announced.</p> <p>The current 15-year limit will be scrapped as part of a bid to strengthen ties with expats abroad following the decision to leave the EU. </p> <p>The plans, which will have to be ratified by both houses of parliament, were announced on Friday by Chris Skidmore, the minister for the constitution, and follow a campaign by the second world war veteran Harry Shindler.</p> <p> \u201cBritish citizens who move abroad remain a part of our democracy and it is important they have the ability to participate,\u201d said Skidmore. \u201cFollowing the British people\u2019s decision to leave the EU, we now need to strengthen ties with countries around the world and show the UK is an outward-facing nation. </p> <p>\u201cOur expat community has an important role to play in helping Britain expand international trade, especially given two-thirds of expats live outside the EU.</p> <p>\u201cExpats retain strong links with the United Kingdom: they may have family here, and indeed they may plan to return here in the future.

  "<p>On 3 July 1789, in the middle of the night, the Marquis de Sade was dragged from his cell in the ironically named Liberty tower of the Bastille. Earlier that day he had been caught shouting to the crowd gathered outside the prison walls that the inmates\u2019 throats were being cut. He was transferred to an asylum outside Paris, and forced to leave many of his most precious possessions behind, including a copper cylinder kept hidden in a crevice in the wall. When his wife set off for the Bastille to fetch his belongings on 14 July, it was already too late: the Revolution had beaten her to it, and she had to turn back empty-handed.</p> <p>Sade wept \u201ctears of blood\u201d over the loss. Inside the cylinder was a scroll, 12m long and 11cm wide, covered in minute handwriting: the manuscript of an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/apr/03/marquis-de-sade-scroll-120-days-sodom-paris\">unfinished novel called <em>The 120 Days of Sodom</em></a>, or <em>The School of Libertinage</em>.</p> <p>Though Sade never saw his scroll again, its story was far from over. Somehow it escaped the storming of the Bastille in the hands of a young man called Arnoux de Saint-Maximin, who then sold it to a Proven\u00e7al aristocrat, the Marquis de Villeneuve-Trans. His family held on to it for more than a 100 years before eventually selling it to a German collector, who allowed the pioneering sexologist Iwan Bloch to publish the novel for the first time in 1904. Sade\u2019s descendants, the Nouailles family, bought the scroll back in 1929 and kept it until 1982, when they entrusted the publisher, Jean Grouet, with its valuation. But he smuggled it over the border to Switzerland, and sold it to a leading collector of erotica, G\u00e9rard Nordmann. Decades of legal wrangling ensued between the Nouailles and the Nordmanns, only resolved in 2014 when a private foundation acquired the scroll for \u20ac7m and placed it on display in Paris. The exhibition was cut short when<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/mar/06/frances-king-of-manuscripts-held-over-suspected-pyramid-scheme\"> the director of the foundation was charged with fraud</a>. The scroll, which started its life in prison, is thus under lock and key once again, waiting for the courts to decide its future.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"c08de18b708c47bd27811a89ba5b452aa3450329\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c08de18b708c47bd27811a89ba5b452aa3450329/0_63_1163_1453/800.jpg\" alt=\"The Marquis De Sade spent 32 years in prison or in mental hospitals.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Marquis De Sade spent 32 years in prison or in mental hospitals.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Channel 4</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The story of the scroll, complete with Proven\u00e7al noblemen, prison-breaks, and shadowy booksellers, reads rather like the life of the man who created it. By the time Sade wrote <em>The 120 Days</em> he had spent eight years in prison, first in Vincennes then the Bastille. He had also been shot at, burnt in effigy and forced to live on the run \u2013 on one occasion escaping to Italy with his sister-in-law, and lover, Anne-Prosp\u00e8re. Though the Surrealists would eventually cast him as a martyr to freedom, Sade was in prison not for his words but for his deeds. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/quiz/2014/dec/02/marquis-de-sade-200-years-quiz\">He was a notorious libertine </a>even by the standards of his age. His 20s and 30s had been marked by a series of public scandals: a sexual assault on a young woman named Rose Keller; an orgy in Marseille which led to four prostitutes falling ill after consuming chocolate-coated Spanish fly (an aphrodisiac); and, most disturbingly, a winter spent in his chateau with his wife and several freshly recruited servants aged around 15 \u2013 the so-called \u201clittle girls affair\u201d. After years of covering up her son-in-law\u2019s behaviour, Madame de Montreuil had finally had enough: she had the king sign a <em>lettre de cachet</em>, a royal warrant that meant Sade could be incarcerated indefinitely. He was arrested in February 1777 and remained in prison for the next 13 years.</p> <p>Sade began drafting his novel in earnest on 22 October 1785, working from seven to 10 each evening over 37 consecutive days. The novel is not complete, however, as only the introduction and the first of its four parts are written in full. The remainder are very detailed summaries but no more. Though he had ample opportunity over the next four years, Sade never completed his first \u2013 and most extreme \u2013 novelistic enterprise. Perhaps he realised it was unpublishable \u2013 a conclusion that censors and courts around the world would repeatedly endorse over the course of the 20th century. He described his novel as \u201cthe most impure tale ever written since the world began\u201d and, for all the hyperbole, his description still holds true even now.</p> <p><em>The 120 Days</em> tells the tale of four libertines \u2013 a duke, a bishop, a judge and a banker \u2013 who lock themselves away in a castle in the Black Forest with an entourage that includes two harems of teenage boys and girls specially abducted for the occasion. Four ageing brothel madams are appointed as storytellers for each of the four months, and their brief is to weave a 150 \u201cpassions\u201d or perversions into the story of their lives.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>There are some books that are not fit for all people and some people who are not fit for all books</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The libertines, surrounded by their victims, listen and enact the passions described, and as the passions become more brutal, so do the libertines: the novel builds to a violent climax with the \u201ccriminal\u201d and \u201cmurderous\u201d passions of Parts Three and Four. These are presented as long, numbered lists, interspersed with brief accounts of the scenes they inspire. Sade\u2019s tortures range from the cartoonish (\u201cHe vigorously flattens a foot with a hammer\u201d) to the clinical (\u201cHer air supply is turned off and on at whim inside a pneumatic machine\u201d); and from the surreal (\u201cThey make her swallow a serpent which in turn will devour her\u201d) to the mundane (\u201cHe dislocates a wrist\u201d). But the vast majority are simply too obscene and too violent to be quoted, as one nameless victim after another is subjected to increasingly elaborate and frenzied torments.</p> <p>These relentless lists read like a series of nightmarish diary entries, or a set of instructions for an apprentice torturer. <em>The 120 Days</em> is not a work that seduces its readers: it assaults them. Reading it is, thankfully perhaps, a unique experience.</p> <p>Sade\u2019s once unpublishable novel has now joined the ranks of Penguin\u2019s Classics for the first time, and its author will take his place alongside the great figures of world literature \u2013 many of whom would no doubt turn in their graves at the news that their club now counted Sade among its members. It is a significant cultural moment for a work that was for so long the preserve of a privileged few. Indeed, ever since Sade began work on his draft, <em>The 120 Days</em> has been a hidden text \u2013 hidden first by its author and later by its subsequent owners.</p> <p>For much of the 20th century, even those who published the novel did their best to keep it away from the prying eyes of the authorities. These early editions were published \u2013 pseudonymously or anonymously in some cases \u2013 in very small numbers for private and wealthy subscribers, and thus remained inaccessible to the general public. It is no coincidence that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2001/jun/30/biography.artsandhumanities\">Jean-Jacques Pauvert \u2013 the first publisher to put his own name to an edition of Sade\u2019s major works</a>, and the first to attempt a larger print run \u2013 was prosecuted by the French government in 1956 for committing an outrage against public morals.</p> <p>Pauvert argued that Sade\u2019s works were \u201cmedico-legal documents\u201d of great scientific value, and that his editions were in any case too expensive for ordinary members of the public to buy. Most of his sales, he insisted, had been to doctors and medical faculties \u2013 Sade was, in other words, in safe hands. The judge disagreed, but his verdict was overturned on appeal, and a little over a decade later, Sade\u2019s works were available in France in mass-market paperbacks. Sade is now firmly established as part of the French literary canon.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0166afafa563a573cd690d146e20cbf88ae8ee8d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0166afafa563a573cd690d146e20cbf88ae8ee8d/0_339_2465_1479/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A scene from Pier Paolo Pasolini\u2019s 1975 film of Salo, or The 120 Days of Sodom.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A scene from Pier Paolo Pasolini\u2019s 1975 film of <em>Salo, or The 120 Days of Sodom</em>.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/United Artists</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This concern about the wider circulation of the works was as revealing of class anxieties as it was about attitudes towards Sade. To say that his works posed a risk to the public was really to say that a public able to read Sade was itself a risky prospect. These same anxieties resurfaced a few years later across the Channel, just when it looked as if Sade was beginning to gain a foothold in British culture.</p> <p>Though the translations published by the Olympia Press in Paris were banned from the UK throughout the 1950s, British publishers such as Peter Owen were able to produce (very careful) selections from Sade\u2019s writings without running into trouble. In the wake of<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/oct/22/dh-lawrence-lady-chatterley-trial\"> the <em>Lady Chatterley\u2019s Lover</em> trial in 1960</a>, a test case for the Obscene Publications Act passed a year before, more publishing houses were emboldened to publish Sade. But all this came to a halt with the Moors murders trial of 1966, and with the revelation that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2013/jun/28/ian-brady-learned-moors-murderer\">Ian Brady </a>had owned a paperback Corgi edition of Sade\u2019s <em>Justine</em>.</p> <p>Brady\u2019s taste in books was widely reported in the tabloid press, and fired the public imagination \u2013 a fire stoked by commentators who saw his reading of Sade in \u201cfairly recent paperback\u201d and his crimes as a matter of cause and effect. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/feb/14/comment.stephenmoss\">George Steiner </a>alluded to the \u201chigh probability\u201d that Brady\u2019s reading of <em>Justine</em> was a \u201csignificant factor\u201d in the case. Pamela Hansford Johnson fretted about the threat posed by the rise of \u201ca semi-literate reading public\u201d: \u201cThere are some books that are not fit for all people and some people who are not fit for all books.\u201d</p> <p>It did not seem to matter that the copy of <em>Justine</em> that Brady owned had only appeared in print after he had committed all but one of his murders. A ban on the publication and importation of Sade\u2019s works swiftly followed the trial and remained in effect for more than 20 years. When a British publisher, Arrow Books, finally tested the ban by reprinting Sade\u2019s major novels in the late 1980s and early 90s, Ann Winterton MP led calls for the DPP to act, condemning <em>Juliette</em> as \u201cfilth of a particularly ugly and dangerous kind\u201d.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Publishing The 120 Days as a classic changes it still further and makes Sade a little more respectable</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>It is hard to imagine a work of fiction prompting calls for prosecution in Britain today. The written word no longer seems to frighten people in the same way any more. The fear that novels used to inspire has shifted instead to more recent \u2013 and visual \u2013 forms of fiction and fantasy such as video games, horror movies, and internet pornography.</p> <p>It is telling that the controversial section relating to \u201cextreme pornography\u201d in the Criminal Justice and Immigration Act 2009 deals only with images, and makes no mention of the written word. But is this because words now seem safe, or because they are just too slippery for the law?</p> <p>In 2003, MPs debated whether \u201cpaedophile pornography\u201d could be textual as well as visual. A young George Osborne advised his fellow MPS against delving into the \u201cquagmire\u201d of words: \u201cIn previous generations, people have been dragged into debates about works of literature, such as <em>Lolita</em>, or works that do not quite qualify as literature, such as those by the Marquis de Sade, and parliament should not be drawn down that avenue again.\u201d Even works that are \u201cnot quite\u201d literature have words in them \u2013 reason enough, Osborne suggests, for politicians and lawyers to steer clear of them.</p> <p>Do Sade\u2019s novels now qualify as great literature? That a novel as extreme as <em>The</em> <em>120 Days</em> is part of a \u201cclassics\u201d collection tells us just how much our sense of literature has changed over the past few decades. And publishing <em>The</em> <em>120 Days</em> as a classic changes it still further: if it makes Sade a little more respectable, it also makes literature a little more dangerous than it was before.</p> <p>\u2022 Will McMorran is a lecturer at Queen Mary University of London.

  "<p>For most Americans the fallout of the 2008 financial crisis was all too obvious. The economy imploded, jobs disappeared, house prices collapsed. But coming to grips with the reason it was happening \u2013 the run on mortgage-backed securities, collateralized debt obligations (AKA, CDOs), credit default swaps, synthetic derivatives, tranches \u2013 was not so easy.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p> The mumbo jumbo mattered \u2013 and that\u2019s what made it all the more infuriating. It was a banking crisis that only the insiders could decode.</p> <p> Even on the occasions (both then and since) when the bank CEOs have been dragged in front of Congress for what have become almost ritual attempts to humiliate and shame them, most of those efforts have been failures. Why? Partly because of <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/why-havent-bankers-been-punished-just-read-these-insider-sec-emails\">the way the bankers dodged and dived</a>, of course. And partly because the issues involved just didn\u2019t make it easy for anyone to catch a dodging, weaving banker, advised by a canny, high-priced lawyer. </p> <p>It just wasn\u2019t that easy for some of the non-specialists on Senate and House committees to be as effective as they might have liked in pillorying the finance industry when the subject was the way in which traders had rigged the Libor rate (the interbank borrowing rate against which the interest rates on most loans are benchmarked), say, or the precise way in which a hedge fund participated in selecting investments in a derivative sold to a pension fund client. It\u2019s even hard to explain how some of that stuff affected ordinary Americans (even though it did \u2013 ultimately, and sometimes indirectly.) </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/us-money-blog/2016/sep/17/elizabeth-warren-financial-crash-letter-doj\">Elizabeth Warren is still mad about the financial crash, and we should be too</a> </p> </aside>  <p> So let\u2019s be grateful that the banks have finally provided us with a scandal that we can understand, and to the regulators, for (belatedly) addressing a real problem that too many Americans grapple with daily. </p> <p> The Wells Fargo mess is the poster child for it all. Last month, the bank \u2013 one of the oldest in the country, with a tradition dating back to the Pony Express \u2013 disclosed that it would fork over $185m in penalties to regulators after an audit discovered that employees opened as many as 2m deposit and credit accounts in customers\u2019 names but without their consent. </p> <p> Testifying before Congress, John Stumpf, the bank\u2019s CEO and chairman, made much of the breach of trust on the part of more than 5,000 employees who opened the accounts, in an attempt to meeting sales quotas, either earning bonuses or simply holding on to their jobs. While initially he backed away from suggestions that he himself might have been held accountable, last week <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/sep/27/wells-fargo-sales-tactics-investigation-john-stumpf\">he discovered he will share some of their pain</a>: independent directors announced they will implement salary and bonus clawbacks, and Stumpf\u2019s own compensation will be on hold while the directors investigate.</p> <p> But Wells isn\u2019t the only venerable Wall Street name to run afoul of regulators in recent days. Morgan Stanley, too, appears to have been putting pressure on its brokers to engage in \u201cdishonest and unethical conduct\u201d, according to the top securities regulator of Massachusetts, pushing them to cross-sell products.</p> <p> <a href=\"http://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cross-sell.asp\">Cross-selling</a> is at the heart of both the Wells Fargo and the Morgan Stanley scandals, and unlike CDOs and credit default swaps, it\u2019s something that any bank customer can understand all too easily. If you\u2019ve ever walked into a bank \u2013 or talked to a bank representative on the phone \u2013 and had him suggest that you might want to consider opening a new account or that a different product might be just perfect for your needs, when you really just called to reset your pin or check your balance, well, you\u2019ve encountered cross-selling.</p> <p> There\u2019s nothing wrong with it as a business strategy. In fact, it\u2019s eminently logical, and can even be good for customers, to make them aware of products or services that might be out there and fit their needs. But it only works well when it\u2019s done carefully and on a customized basis. </p> <p> As <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/32b989ac-870f-11e6-a75a-0c4dce033ade\">retail banking in the United States has struggled</a> in the current low interest rate environment, with too few creditworthy customers eager to increase their borrowing and help banks boost their profits, institutions like Wells Fargo increasingly viewed selling more products as the best way to increase earnings. If they couldn\u2019t make more on the same number of products, well, they\u2019d just increase the number of products. And so they put in place the kind of bizarrely high targets that prompted those \u201crogue\u201d employees to begin opening fake accounts. Even after they were aware of what was happening, those targets remained in place; even when Stumpf first testified to Congress, the targets were still (theoretically, at least) what Wells Fargo bankers had to hit each day/week/month.</p> <p> You <a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2015/12/finance-big-short/420903/\">don\u2019t need a Jenga game</a>, or Anthony Bourdain cooking a fish stew, Margot Robbie languishing in a bubble bath, or any other tortured metaphor, to explain the concept and just what is wrong with this picture. </p> <p> Similarly, Morgan Stanley allegedly crossed the lines <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-morganstanley-massachusetts-idUSKCN1231KD\">by running cross-selling contests for brokers in five offices</a> in Massachusetts and Rhode Island. The brokers could win as much as $5,000 for convincing customers to take out as many as 30 loans against securities portfolios. Although the firm\u2019s own rules banned the contests, the compliance office didn\u2019t figure out what was going on for a year, until the end of 2014. Even then, the contests didn\u2019t stop until April 2015, according to the complaint filed by William Galvin, secretary of the Commonwealth. Meanwhile, the contests generated $24m in new loans for Morgan Stanley, Galvin said. </p> <p> A spokesman for Morgan Stanley has said the complaint is without merit and that the bank plans to defend itself vigorously. The loans were only open after discussing the product with each client, he added.</p> <p> That distinguishes it from Wells Fargo, whose clients had no idea that accounts were being opened in their name. On the other hand, did Morgan Stanley\u2019s clients know that their brokers were competing \u2013 and being paid \u2013 to open these new loan accounts? That the reason they were being offered the product might have as much or more to do with the broker\u2019s own financial wellbeing as with their own real needs? (Did they really need a new loan? Or the risk associated with taking out a loan against a securities portfolio when the market is near what seems likely to be its peak?) I suspect not.</p> <p> Thomas Curry, the US comptroller of the currency, has <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-banks-regulation-idUSKCN11L2U0\">warned other banks to review their own cross-selling practices</a> and has told Congress that his own staff will be evaluating what the largest banks are up to in this respect. It\u2019s about time. Hopefully, he\u2019ll report back with the answers. At least, when he does, we\u2019ll all understand what he\u2019s talking about. At the end of the day, it\u2019s really not much different than the high-pressure telephone sales guy who simply will not hang up or go away. Only because it\u2019s your banker who\u2019s putting you on the spot, you\u2019re a particularly vulnerable kind of captive audience who can\u2019t just hang up. </p>",

The city of about 600,000 known for its progressive ethos is struggling with skyrocketing rents, low vacancy rates and constant pressure on the region\u2019s most vulnerable citizens to move further outside the city\u2019s limits.</p> <p>\u201cWe consider it like a gold rush,\u201d said Katrina Holland, the executive director of the Community Alliance of Tenants, a nonprofit working to change Oregon\u2019s law to end the legality of no-cause evictions. \u201cA house is where you live, raise your children, take a shower, recover when you\u2019re sick, create a community \u2026 To hear a landlord was so fixated on increasing rents or making renovations to increase rents to the point where people currently living there are told to vacate don\u2019t have a roof? That\u2019s inhumane.\u201d</p> <p>Biggs, who grew up in Portland, wasn\u2019t surprised when she received the eviction letter.

I knew it was coming,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Her neighbors once marveled at how nicely decorated her apartment was.

The city declared a housing emergency earlier this year.</p> <p>\u201cThe market is so hot right now,\u201d Phan said, adding there\u2019s effective displacement of residents across the city, but it\u2019s consistently cut along racial lines.</p> <p>\u201cEveryone in Portland has this ideal that we want to live in a progressive place, with walkability and biking,\u201d Phan said. \u201cBut people of color and those that are poor don\u2019t have these things and are being pushed out.

  "<p>The trend for long-running crime fiction series means that the half-dozen novels that Tana French has written over the past decade are sometimes catalogued as \u201cDublin Murder Squad Books 1-6\u201d. But, although the works are sequential, the connections between them are unusually tangential for the genre. This has become a key part of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/jul/27/tana-french-interview\" title=\"\">French\u2019s distinctive brilliance</a>.</p> <p>Eschewing a franchise protagonist, French grants the controlling perspective to a different detective each time. Frank Mackey, the main cop in the third book, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/aug/28/book-review-faithful-place-tana-french\" title=\"\"><em>Faithful Place</em></a>, is a background character in the fifth title, the echoingly named <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/sep/06/the-secret-place-tana-french-review\" title=\"\"><em>The Secret Place</em></a>; and, in another example of this reprise technique, Frank\u2019s daughter, Holly, a nine-year-old witness in the earlier book, has become a 16-year-old suspect by the later one.</p> <p>It\u2019s a badge of French\u2019s talent that the two books featuring the Mackeys can be read with enjoyment separately or non-chronologically, but regular readers gain an extra level from the backstories, as, crucially, do the fictional figures, who become layered with memories, secrets and sensitivities in the way that real people are.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/jul/21/clare-mackintosh-takes-novel-of-the-year-award\">Clare Mackintosh takes crime novel of the year award</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In the closest that French has got to a conventional followup, <em>The Trespasser</em> allows a second successive case to Detectives Antoinette Conway and Stephen Moran, who investigated the killing of a teenage boy within the grounds of an exclusive girls\u2019 private school in <em>The Secret Place</em>, the book that gold-plated French\u2019s reputation in both the UK and US.</p> <p>Typically, though, the novelist now hands the narrative from Moran to Conway, so that the partnership is viewed through a fresh lens. Conway is&#xa0;unusual among her murder squad colleagues in being both a woman and&#xa0;non-white, emphasising an outsider status already made likely by her loner persona and explosive temper. The perspective change is sometimes startling; the story told by Moran made sensitively little of Conway\u2019s race, but she understandably says much more about&#xa0;it herself.</p> <p>The partners are sent, apparently on the cab-rank principle of next detectives due a job, to a flat where Aislinn Murray, a young receptionist, has been found dead, her head smashed against a stone fireplace. A burnt dinner in the oven and table laid for two lead to the initial assumption that the killing results from a lovers\u2019 row or, in the sick-slick cop lingo that fizzes through the books, \u201cboy-beats-girl\u201d. Rory Fallon, a bashful bookshop owner who was surprised to be admitted to Aislinn\u2019s affections, becomes prime suspect, assumed to have thumped her after being dumped.</p> <p>The view that it must be Rory is most volubly put by a squad veteran, egotistical smoothie Detective Breslin, who impresses on the lead duo the virtues of a \u201cquick solve\u201d. But, this early on in a long novel, readers know that the solution can\u2019t be that simple, and French knows that we know \u2026 She satisfyingly complicates the situation with the victim\u2019s involvement in a previous police invesigation, and questions about whether Conway and Moran were allotted the case for reasons other&#xa0;than roster logic.</p> <p>French\u2019s novels each adopt a particular sub-theme and technical challenge. <em>The Secret Place</em> used an unusual narrative rhythm \u2013 chapters set on a single day alternating with sections flashing back over a year \u2013 to explore the allegiances and deceits of adolescent friendship. In <em>The Trespasser</em>, the subplot topic, extending scenarios that French rehearsed in the Mackey books, is father-daughter relationships. Both Conway and the victim have absent dads, and their respective attitudes to this gap in their lives take on gathering significance. The narrative\u2019s final surprise involves a startling quasi-paternal intervention from a member of the cast who has seemed far from daddyish.</p> <p>The compositional challenge the novelist has set herself on this occasion is that, in contrast to the multi-suspect configuration of <em>The Secret Place</em>, there is just one name in the frame for most of the pages, with no forensic evidence and only circumstantial witness testimony.</p> <p>This means that Conway and Moran have to talk the solution out of the suspect and any connections they can muster. \u201cAll these stories,\u201d Conway laments late in the day, but, just a few pages later, a further interrogation has added \u201canother story.\u201d</p> <p>The puzzle can only be resolved by hard listening and smart questioning, setting traps through tone and vocabulary, in extended encounters that display French\u2019s virtuosity in the the phrasing and pacing of inquisitorial dialogue. <em>The Trespasser</em> contains the most tense and serpentine interrogation scenes outside of John le Carr\u00e9.</p> <p>Between the thrilling and twisty verbal exchanges, the novel is also a triumph of voice. Shards of jargon \u2013 a detective is a \u201cD\u201d, a victim a \u201cvic\u201d and random killings \u201crandos\u201d \u2013 glint from sentences with a Chandleresque quality of poetic-depressive. Conway marks one interviewee as \u201cPoet meets Pervert \u2013 floppy shirts and a dandruffy mac\u201d, and entering rooms in Murder HQ, sketches them as \u201cstinking of night shift and stale Spar danishes\u201d</p> <p>As the reader hopes, the eventual explanation lies very far from the failed date-night championed by Breslin, finally incorporating complex psychosexuality and dangerous personal and professional calculations. <em>The Trespasser</em> shows French to be a one-off phenomenon. Her only problem now is whether the intoxicating creation of Antoinette Conway challenges her to abandon her policy of cop&#xa0;rotation next time round.</p> <p>\u2022&#xa0;<em>The Trespasser</em> is published by Hodder &amp; Stoughton.

  "<p>The male guardianship system in Saudi Arabia is not just law: it is a set of bylaws and state-sanctioned discriminatory policies and practices <a href=\"https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/saudi-arabia/2016-08-10/guardians-gender-gap\" title=\"\">that restrict a woman\u2019s ability</a> to have a wide range of choices unless permitted by her male guardian \u2013 typically a father, husband, brother or even a son.</p> <p>In practice, it means women are unrecognised by the state as full legal adults.</p> <p>This year, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/26/saudi-arabia-protest-petition-end-guardianship-law-women\" title=\"\">female activists joined forces</a> to promote abolishing the system through a petition and received massive online support. It seemed that, contrary to earlier campaigns for women for municipal participation or driving, this campaign had a life of its own. Women activists submitted a letter to the Royal Advisory Council in 2014 and though women members of the council expressed support no significant change ensued.</p> <p>This time I drafted the petition to the king around Saudi\u2019s national transformation plan and urged him to consider the significant impact of the guardianship system on the risk to women of poverty, exploitation and domestic violence. The impact of the guardianship system on women\u2019s lives has long been highlighted by human rights organisations, as well as by local community figures. The United Nations special rapporteur for violence against women <a href=\"https://documents-dds-ny.un.org/doc/UNDOC/GEN/G09/128/22/PDF/G0912822.pdf?OpenElement\" title=\"\">submitted a report in 2008</a> in which she attributed violence against women to the male-guardianship system and the enforced gender-segregation policy, both of which limited women\u2019s ability to escape or report violence. Human Rights Watch outlined in detail the restrictions of the guardianship system on women in <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/report/2008/04/19/perpetual-minors/human-rights-abuses-stemming-male-guardianship-and-sex\" title=\"\">2008</a> and <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/news/2016/07/16/saudi-arabia-male-guardianship-boxes-women\" title=\"\">2016</a>.</p> <p>I highlighted the incompatibility of the system with Saudi laws and how it places a huge burden on the state\u2019s administrative, financial and judicial resources, as well as on the guardians themselves, who may not necessarily be able to provide the needed permissions because of their absence at work or on military service. I also reminded the king that there is no basis for that system in Islam, as supported by Islamic scholars.</p> <p>Abolishing the system will have a profound impact on the untapped potential of women\u2019s economic participation. We called on the king to enforce regulations and measures to allow women to obtain all forms of identification cards, take advantage of all educational and professional opportunities, choose a place of residence, travel, obtain any form of medical or emergency service, have access to services from private or public institutions, get release from prisons, rehabilitation or correctional facilities or apply for jobs anywhere without a guardian permission.</p> <p>In about a month, nearly <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/26/saudi-arabia-protest-petition-end-guardianship-law-women\" title=\"\">15,000 online signatures</a> from men and women of all backgrounds and regions of Saudi Arabia were collected. It was marvellous to see physicians, students, graduates, businesswomen, professors, teachers and residents of cities big and small listed. On the two days leading up to the petition, an estimated 2,500 women sent direct telegrams to the Saudi king\u2019s office imploring him to end the guardianship system. Activist Aziza Al-Yousef mailed the petition to the royal court after being instructed to do so when she tried to deliver it in person, but there has been no response so far.</p> <p>The mainstream religious lobby was immediately on the defensive. Saudi Arabia\u2019s highest Islamic figure, the grand mufti, denounced the call to abolish guardianship as a crime against Islam. On the other hand, a number of key religious figures supported ending guardianship on the basis that the system does not have a grounding in Islam; a conflicting scenario typical to every public demand to reform women\u2019s rights. State officials repeatedly attribute delays in enforcing gender equality to cultural beliefs.</p> <p>A few years back, my 10-year-old nephew told me of an Islamic studies teacher in his international school who acted like a clown in front of his class of male pupils to demonstrate how a woman can supposedly behave irrationally in dealing with death to justify the religious opinions banning women from attending burials.</p> <p>Similar, more subtle, messages in Saudi Arabia\u2019s all male-dominated spheres are rarely challenged by intimidated youth, including my loving nephew, for fear of pressure from peers or authority figures.</p> <p>The political will that created those norms and fostered this culture would require more than wishful thinking or simply waiting for society-wide acceptance. The royal decrees that allowed women to sit on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jan/11/saudi-king-allows-women-advisory-council\" title=\"\">Saudi\u2019s royal advisory council</a> and the municipality passed without significant societal resistance; this method could be called upon again to abolish the guardianship system that causes so much harm to Saudi women.</p>",
  "<p>Another council \u2013 Sandwell \u2013 has been ordered by the government to <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-birmingham-37572560\">contract out its statutory children\u2019s social work services</a>. </p> <p>This means services including child protection investigations, making applications to the courts to have children removed from their families and the management of children in need plans will be outsourced to an independent organisation, and accountability back to the council will be through a contract.</p> <p>No other country allows this intrusion into families, and decisions about the welfare and protection of children, to be undertaken outside its direct provision and control. This raises a number of issues of considerable concern.<br></p> <p>First, as this process of local councils being directed by the education secretary to give up direct provision of statutory children\u2019s social work gathers pace \u2013 apparently unchecked by the new prime minister \u2013 it is one of the mechanisms delivering the government\u2019s agenda that children\u2019s social work services should be outside local authorities. It is a Trojan horse opening up children\u2019s social services to the marketplace.</p> <p>David Cameron spoke of wanting the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/pm-we-will-not-stand-by-failing-childrens-services-will-be-taken-over\">\u201cacademisation\u201d of statutory children\u2019s social work services</a> with new <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/prime-minister-my-vision-for-a-smarter-state\">\u201cmarket insurgents\u201d</a> to take over services. Despite the political tangle with Conservative councillors about the <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/2016/05/06/david-cameron-announces-climbdown-on-academies-following-tory-re/\">forced academisation of all schools</a>, there has been no sign that the removal of children\u2019s social work from councils has been put on the back burner.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/social-care-network/2016/sep/08/giving-power-over-social-work-to-a-cuts-obsessed-government-is-a-mistake\">Giving power over social work to a cuts-obsessed government is a mistake</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Furthermore, all the local authorities that have been forced or coerced into contracting out statutory responsibilities for the welfare and safety of children have been Labour controlled \u2013 Doncaster, Slough, Sunderland, Birmingham and now Sandwell. </p> <p>This is surprising, indeed shocking, when there are Conservative-controlled councils that have had equal or even greater difficulties with children\u2019s services. They have had repeated Ofsted judgments of inadequate, have struggled to recruit and retain social workers, with no consistent leadership, and backlogs of assessments of children and big and expanding workloads for practitioners. </p> <p>I know about the tremendous commitment by managers and workers in these councils to make improvements, and they need the time and stability to be able to do so. I am certainly not arguing that they should have the disruption and disorganisation of having their social work services taken outside their councils. But what is a particular concern is that Sandwell, where I oversaw child protection improvement from 2012-15, should now be set back.</p> <p>Sandwell had built a stable workforce, management and leadership; was largely in control of its busy workloads, and had processes in place to improve practice (which takes time and a continuing focus). It has had an experienced and respected independent chair of its local safeguarding children\u2019s board, good partnership working with other organisations, and sensible political governance and oversight. Its children\u2019s social work services and committed practitioners and managers will now be undermined and destabilised.</p> <p>The third issue is that taking these services outside of councils is not a quick fix or easy solution. Indeed, it stalls and delays the actions to drive improvement. Instead of a strong focus on frontline practice, building an organisational culture supporting this practice with senior managers close to their frontline services, and creating a stable workforce with strong partnerships and collaboration with other agencies, for the first year or so attention and time is given to creating the new organisation and the contract arrangements. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/social-care-network/2016/may/25/birmingham-childrens-services-dispatches-channel-4\">Birmingham children's services are again being churned up and set back</a> </p> </aside>  <p>This should be recognised by the small number of former senior managers in children\u2019s services who are advising that services should be removed from councils, and who have then been contracted to have key roles in setting up these new trusts. </p> <p>The experienced Conservative council leader who was the Local Government Association lead for children\u2019s services says the way to assist councils in difficulty is to <a href=\"http://www.local.gov.uk/media-releases/-/journal_content/56/10180/7610579/NEWS\">deploy successful councils\u2019 wisdom and expertise</a> to help other authorities. The government has allowed this approach, with good results, for some \u2013 mainly Conservative controlled \u2013 local authorities. </p> <p>This is sensible and constructive. It has not been allowed, however, for the Labour councils moving children\u2019s social work into a marketplace open to all comers. </p> <p>In the past, affluent philanthropists committed money to help the poor and those in difficulty. Now rich venture capitalists and others seek to make a profit from public funding, which should be available to fund services and assistance. </p> <p>If the government\u2019s concern is about poor or unhelpful political leadership within a small number of councils \u2013 and this is not exclusive to Labour councils and it certainly did not apply in Sandwell \u2013 there is the remedy of appointing a commissioner to oversee and direct children\u2019s social services provision. It is less disruptive and draconian than removing services from the council and from local accountability, delivery and transparency.</p> <p>As more councils struggle to deliver statutory children\u2019s social work services, the government may well use this as an opportunity to promote the market place of \u201cnewcos\u201d and \u201cmarket insurgents\u201d. </p> <p>Surely it is about time for the political opposition to challenge this ideological ambition, especially when it is Labour councils being forced to deliver the agenda. Or maybe the new prime minister will think it a step too far to allow profit to be made from vulnerable children and families and that these services should remain a direct state responsibility delivered through local councils. </p> <p>As a start, the prime minister and education secretary might take note of the wise and well-informed education select committee <a href=\"http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201617/cmselect/cmeduc/201/201.pdf\">report on social work</a> (pdf) and <a href=\"https://hansard.parliament.uk/lords/2016-07-11/debates/1607127000561/ChildrenAndSocialWorkBill(HL)\">comments in the Lords debate</a> on the children and social work bill, which argue against the rush to move statutory children\u2019s social work and child protection outside of local authorities.</p> <p><strong><a href=\"https://register.theguardian.com/social-care/\">Join the Social Care Network</a> to read more pieces like this.

  "<p>A push by the shipping and oil industries for a five-year delay to curbs on toxic sulphur emissions would cause an extra 200,000 premature deaths from lung cancer and heart disease, according to an unpublished International Maritime Organisation (IMO) study.</p> <p> Fatalities from illnesses such as asthma were not covered by the leaked paper, which was based on shipping satellite data and modelling work. </p> <p>The shipping industry is by far the world\u2019s biggest emitter of sulphur with SOx levels in heavy fuel oils <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-shipping-regulation-imo-idUSKCN1240KF\">up to 3,500 times higher</a> than those in current European diesel standards for vehicles. A single large cruise ship can reportedly burn <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/may/21/the-worlds-largest-cruise-ship-and-its-supersized-pollution-problem\">as much fuel as whole towns</a>, and emit more sulphur than 7m cars.</p> <p>At the end of October, an IMO meeting in London will decide whether to cap the sulphur content of shipping fuels by 2020 or 2025. Current levels can reach 3.5% but the cap would limit them to 0.5%.</p> <p>The 2020 deadline faces fierce resistance from the oil and gas industry association, <a href=\"http://www.ipieca.org/\">IPIECA</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.bimco.org/\">Bimco</a>, a global shipping group, which argue that there is not enough low-sulphur fuel available to meet the global demand that the measure would spur.</p> <p>The EU has thrown its weight behind 2020, unilaterally imposing the new IMO standard from then. With China enforcing similar emissions control zones, the new benchmark for 2020 is thought likely to pass, although the US and large flag states\u2019 positions remain wildcards.</p> <p>James Corbett, one of the report\u2019s lead authors, told the Guardian that any slippage on the 2020 start date risked grave consequences.</p> <p> \u201cAn IMO policy implemented on time in 2020 could reduce the health burden on coastal communities, particularly in Asia, Africa and Latin America,\u201d he said. \u201cThe inverse is also true. A delay would ensure that health impacts from sulphur emissions persisted in coastal communities that are exposed, where shipping lanes are most intense and communities most densely populated.\u201d</p> <p> Egypt, Panama, Japan, India, Singapore, the Philippines and China would be among the countries hardest hit, Corbett added.</p> <p> </p> <p></p> <p>Sveinung Oftedal, Norway\u2019s lead negotiator at the IMO, said that domestic health concerns had now overtaken fears about the acidifying effects that sulphur has on Scandinavia\u2019s lakes and rivers.</p> <p> \u201cAir pollution from shipping is not just a local or regional, but a global, problem,\u201d he said. \u201cThe question is whether we can really continue to accept its effects, and the answer is: no, we cannot. The 2020 deadline is needed and it is achievable.\u201d</p> <p> But resentment in the beleaguered shipping trade is unmistakeable, and a sign of future fights to come in the IMO over shipping\u2019s CO2 emissions, which roughly equal those from aviation.</p> <p> \u201cMost shipping companies are not turkeys voting for Christmas,\u201d an industry source said. \u201cThey\u2019re under the impression that a decision to delay to 2025 would be of collective economic benefit. In the real world, shipowners are bleeding money. There is total depression in the industry.\u201d</p> <p> Thousands of container ships belonging to Hanjin, south Korea\u2019s biggest shipping firm, were left <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/news/business-37241727\">adrift on the world\u2019s oceans</a> carrying a \u00a314bn cargo, after the firm <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/sep/02/hanjin-shipping-bankruptcy-causes-turmoil-in-global-sea-freight\">filed for bancruptcy</a> last month. </p> <p> The International Chambers of Shipping (ICS) says that imposing the new benchmark in 2020 would cost industry an additional $50-100bn a year, owing to the cost of low-sulphur fuels.</p> <p> Ships today mostly run on cheap blends of the residues and remainders left over from the refining and distillation of crude oil for aircraft jet fuel and automobile diesel.</p> <p> Bimco argues that a premature move to low-sulphur fuels could have knock-on inflationary effects for other fuels, as increased diesel demand overwhelms supply.</p> <p> Lars Robert Pedersen, Bimco\u2019s deputy secretary-general, told the Guardian: \u201cQuite frankly, if the IMO decides to ignore these very concrete facts, ships will start to use other fuel streams and there will then obviously be a shortage in those streams and a potential disruption in the flow of energy to supply world markets.\u201d</p> <p> Corbett estimates the total cost of the measure at $30bn, compared to a value of seaborne trade approaching <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-southchinasea-idUSKCN0WA0ER\">$5tn in the South China Sea alone</a>. Supporters of an early sulphur cap say that its effect on commodity prices such as shoes or bananas would be little more than a few cents.</p> <p> Crucially, a second IMO report seen by the Guardian finds that enough refineries will be available in 2020 to guarantee the future availability of a low-sulphur fuel supply for all the world\u2019s ships.</p> <p> \u201cIn all scenarios, the refinery sector has the capability to supply sufficient quantities of marine fuels with a sulphur content of 0.5% m/m or less ... to meet demand for these products, while also meeting demand for non-marine fuels,\u201d it says.</p> <p> A capacity shortage in 2020 would be the only grounds for IMO delegates to delay the proposal, under its terms of reference, which some fear could then be extended indefinitely.</p> <p> In a reflection of differing opinions in the sea freight trade, the ICS is neutral on the timeline for phasing out sulphur, while calling for a speedy resolution of the issue.</p> <p> The oil industry too is ambivalent. One analyst with close knowledge of the issue said: \u201cMajor oil companies such as Shell and BP don\u2019t have a problem with a move to cleaner fuel in the shipping sector because they have advanced refineries which could sell higher value fuels and increase their revenues and potentially, their profits.\u201d</p> <p> Later this month, a global CO2 data collection system for ships will be launched. Neither shipping nor aviation firms are covered by the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/dec/12/paris-climate-deal-key-points\">Paris climate agreement</a>, although the ICS has called for the UN\u2019s climate pledging system to be extended to the industry. </p>",

  "<p>Gentrification? \u201c<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szrsfeyLzyg\">There\u2019s an app for that</a>,\u201d as the saying goes. The proliferation of apps that deliver all kinds of on-demand services in urban areas \u2013 from laundry to restaurant food \u2013 just might be exacerbating the gentrification of certain neighbourhoods in many western cities. If descriptions like \u201cthe startup is diversifying its black cab app with a <a href=\"http://www.standard.co.uk/lifestyle/esmagazine/the-30-best-apps-for-londoners-from-coffee-meets-bagel-to-uber-a3101986.html\">bubbles-and-flutes delivery service available to users in selected postcodes</a>\u201d no longer sound like a joke to you, you probably live in one of them. </p> <p>We already know the impact <a href=\"http://www.techinsider.io/more-proof-that-uber-is-killing-the-taxi-industry-2016-1\">Uber has had on taxis</a>, Airbnb on hotels, and even, perhaps, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/jul/15/goodbye-to-all-the-gay-bars-are-dating-apps-killing-queer-culture\">dating apps for gay bars and queer culture</a>. But apps are also taking on long-standing local independent businesses that may not be standing for much longer: everything from cobblers (with the <a href=\"http://chicagoinno.streetwise.co/2015/06/17/how-chicago-startup-shoe-drop-wants-to-bring-innovation-to-the-shoe-care-industry/\">Shoe Drop</a> app) and barbers (Shortcut, <a href=\"http://uk.businessinsider.com/uber-for-haircuts-shortcut-app-review-2014-11?r=US&amp;IR=T\">\u201cUber for haircuts\u201d</a>) to launderettes and dry cleaners (<a href=\"http://www.techworld.com/startups/laundrapp-wants-take-out-uks-dirty-laundry-3634178/\">Laundrapp</a>, ZipJet). </p> <p>Should these on-demand services really catch on, it will be a serious challenge for a whole swathe of independent businesses offering everyday services that are already suffering. If we no longer need to walk to the local shops to get our groceries, drop off our dry cleaning and fix our shoes, just how long will it be before the cafes charging extortionate prices for cups of coffee swoop in to take their place?</p> <p>When you assume that no one needs laundrettes anymore because you can get your laundry picked up and delivered through an app (like one reported Google <a href=\"https://twitter.com/eparillon/status/628028715159691264/photo/1?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">employee did in a telling tweet</a>), you\u2019re automatically annulling a big swathe of the population who actually need them. What\u2019s more, the transformation of these services from physical spaces to simple deliveries <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/apr/03/long-live-launderette-washing-dirty-laundry-laundrapp\">takes away some important inclusive places for social interaction</a>. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7742cf680bfacbecd28ba049eaf6f07c2bf31de3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7742cf680bfacbecd28ba049eaf6f07c2bf31de3/0_144_960_576/500.jpg\" alt=\"An empty launderette in Clapton, London.\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Redundant?

The internet as it relates to locality is of course not totally bad. I\u2019ve used Yelp countless times to find restaurants and shops I would have never otherwise gone to. But good or bad, the effect is the same: locality and the need for local knowledge is lost.\u201d </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Neighbourhoods around the world can now function without having to work at a street level.</p> <footer> <cite>Peter Moskowitz</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>As a result, there might not be a need for you to leave your house \u2013 but even when you do, there won\u2019t be much of practical use. In highly gentrified areas like the Village or Williamsburg, or London\u2019s Shoreditch, galleries, high-end boutiques, and destination restaurants abound. This is beautiful as a playground for tourists, but very problematic for neighbours who actually need to use services on a budget.</p> <p>As a thriving website and app, Airbnb is already putting a strain on rents \u2013 and some say <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/22/airbnb-san-francisco-wanted-posters-chinatown\">contributing to gentrification</a>. By renting apartments out to tourists, its users are, <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeed.com/carolineodonovan/the-rent-is-too-damn-high-the-truth-about-airbnbs-impact-on?utm_term=.hwdQOwld18#.jiMQPeEmO7\">whether they like it or not</a>, contributing to a lack of affordable housing. Cities including Berlin and Barcelona have already taken measures like <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/jun/08/berlin-ban-airbnb-short-term-rentals-upheld-city-court\">banning it</a> altogether or heavily <a href=\"http://www.citylab.com/housing/2015/12/barcelona-airbnb-tourism/421788/\">cracking down</a> on illegal flats on the site. <br></p> <p>Like everything related to the g-word, these processes are far from black and white. For a lot of independent businesses, namely restaurants, getting on the app bandwagon seems to have worked well, helping them stay put and not rely solely on foot traffic. Apps like Deliveroo, the food delivery service that has taken<em> </em>the high street by storm, or Uber\u2019s <a href=\"https://ubereats.com/london/\">food delivery branch</a>, are only a couple of years old, and are <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/freddiedawson/2016/02/26/delivering-25-month-on-month-growth-the-deliveroo-success-story/#455f76004590\">growing rapidly</a> and <a href=\"http://tech.newstatesman.com/guest-opinion/deliveroo-disaster\">employing armies of (precarious) workers</a>. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"be716a73c69f3cd29ff32b67abce4748df7ceb32\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/be716a73c69f3cd29ff32b67abce4748df7ceb32/0_170_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A takeaway shop in the gentrified neighbourhood of Hoxton, east London.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A takeaway shop in the gentrified neighbourhood of Hoxton, east London.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Fiona Hanson/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The supervisor of a Hackney and Finsbury Park-based noodle restaurant, which is now on Deliveroo, commented anonymously: \u201cI don\u2019t think any London restaurant would survive these days with current rent prices without Deliveroo or similar apps. It simply brings the orders up. Even if they\u2019re new, or a chain, or an old Turkish place, they all use it now. London rent is too crazy not to.\u201d </p> <p>Yet a simple walk around the area proves otherwise, as does Deliveroo\u2019s policy: \u201cThe only thing you will not find is low-quality takeaway restaurants.\u201d Asking numerous owners of takeaways who aren\u2019t on the app, they all seem relaxed; they still rely, they tell me, on a local, family-orientated clientele. </p> <p>Of course, the demographics of those who use apps \u2013 <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2012/09/26/forrester-iphone-app-users-young-and-wealthy-android-app-users-skew-older/\">young and wealthy</a> \u2013 coincide with the kind of people who can pay extra for the convenience of getting things delivered or enjoy \u00a33 coffees. It all plays a part in the homogenisation of neighbourhoods in cities throughout the western world, facilitated by social media. Being from Barcelona, I\u2019m dismayed to find New York-style <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/06/hipster-aesthetic-taking-over-world\">hipster aesthetics</a> taking over there, too.

A group of researchers led by Desislava Hristova from Cambridge University have, in fact, found that location-based social networks are a great tool to track the physical progress of urban change. </p> <p>\u201cSocial media and location-based technology are certainly not causing gentrification,\u201d explains Hristova, \u201cbut from my studies there does seem to be a relationship between the typical young professional tech-savvy people who use these apps, the places they go, the information they share about those places \u2013 and what those places are and how they develop over time.\u201d</p> <p>Tools like <a href=\"http://gizmodo.com/tracking-brooklyns-rapid-fire-gentrification-with-googl-1594799132\">Google Street View</a> have long been used to track the striking visual changes that come with gentrification. Hristova and other scientists have <a href=\"http://www.cam.ac.uk/research/news/predicting-gentrification-through-social-networking-data\">published a paper</a> tracking Foursquare and Twitter data in London and found that the more check-ins that were made in a neighbourhood by non-locals, the more likely its chances of soon becoming gentrified. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2016/oct/06/the-airbnb-effect-amsterdam-fairbnb-property-prices-communities\">The 'Airbnb effect': is it real, and what is it doing to a city like Amsterdam?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cLondon areas like Hackney or Newham were the most diverse (in terms of how many people from other areas visit the area) based on our metrics, but also some of most deprived neighbourhoods in London.\u201d Two metrics that go hand in hand in predicting the phenomenon.</p> <p>This raises many questions: how and when should urban planners step in?

And with every day and every month that goes by, you can understand why he just might: why a former prime minister, who has been out of British public life for almost 10 years now, might be tempted to return to the frontline of UK politics.</p> <p>At the most basic level there is the chaotic state of the Labour party, of which the latest leadership election and now the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/oct/06/prevent-programme-should-be-reviewed-and-overhauled-says-terror-law-watchdog-politics-live\" title=\"\">shadow cabinet appointments</a> are continuing proof. If nothing else, Blair brought the fractious party together, by dint of ditching <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/1994/oct/05/labour.uk\" title=\"\">clause IV</a> and, more importantly, winning.</p> <p>Then there is the direction of Corbyn\u2019s Labour party, the open rift between some of the grassroots and the parliamentary party, and the way Blair\u2019s prized centre ground has now been ruthlessly grabbed by Theresa May. You can almost hear Blair crying out in frustration at the lack of anywhere for centrist Labourites to go. He might even be sensing the hand of history once again on his shoulder: might he step forward to save the soul of New Labour, even at the risk of a formal split?</p> <p>And the last straw was surely Brexit. Memories of Blair\u2019s youthfully optimistic first months as prime minister have faded. But this was a time, pre-9/11, pre-Iraq, when the UK had a prime minister who believed in Europe, who dared to try out his school French in public, who spent holidays there without shame, and who contemplated the UK in the euro.</p> <p>In retrospect, that time can be seen as the high-water mark of UK Europeanism. Post-referendum, no British politician has been found to speak up for the UK in Europe. Even model-European Nick Clegg has been quiet. If not me, Blair might reasonably be arguing with himself, then who?</p> <p>The Europe referendum, though, exposed the former prime minister\u2019s difficulty. In UK politics, he is, to many, damaged goods. His occupation of the centre ground had the effect of disenfranchising old Labour.</p> <p>The Iraq debacle, the closeness to George Bush (America\u2019s \u201cpoodle\u201d) and the way Blair went off, post-politics, in pursuit of wealth and seemed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/nov/08/tony-blair-kazakhstan-human-rights-role\" title=\"\">none too fussy</a> about where it came from, have left his credibility compromised. Once, Blair could have been the best advocate for the UK in Europe; when the referendum came, he risked being its worst.</p> <p>And yet ... to hear or see Blair speak in public even now is to sense, almost immediately, the old magic. However sceptical you may be \u2013 and I hold him responsible for much of the popular cynicism that prevails towards politics today \u2013 you cannot fail to see that he still has what it takes to argue his case and move a crowd. His recent decision to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/20/tony-blair-to-close-commercial-enterprises-to-focus-on-charity-work\" title=\"\">wind up his main company</a> to concentrate on pro bono work (oh, yes, while retaining a few private clients, but let that pass) suggested a change of course.</p> <p>Blair\u2019s career to date, however, also highlights a shortcoming of UK public life in general. When people reach the pinnacle of politics while still relatively young \u2013 Blair, and now David Cameron \u2013 they are likely to leave office with many potentially productive years ahead of them.</p> <p>Blair is still only 63. Is money-making \u2013 brazen or discreet, selfish or altruistic \u2013 all that remains? Is there not a way in which their experience can be harnessed for the national good?</p> <p>For a nation with such a rich past, we are not at all good at using historical memory, other than by elevating its bearers to the House of Lords. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/john-major\" title=\"\">John Major</a>\u2019s combination of quiet consultancy, cricket and sparing political intervention has been about as good as it gets. Unless, that is, Blair bounces back on to the scene and shows how political comebacks are done.</p>",

Often ingenious in its sharp definition, the instrumental accompaniment adds texture and colour as it supports Greene\u2019s heroic vocal line.</p>",
  "<p>When I became pregnant, the reason was to start a family, not to somehow embrace femininity or to de-transition. I\u2019m a transgender guy, born with typical female anatomy. I\u2019d taken testosterone for a few years and then stopped in order to conceive. I\u2019d also had chest surgery as part of my transition, so even as my belly grew, I sported a flat, masculine-appearing chest and I maintained my beard.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/mar/25/tell-us-about-a-time-you-faced-your-fear\">Tell us about a time you faced your fear</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The pregnancy and baby were very much planned, but still, there was the question of how I would open up and give birth \u2013 an event centered around parts of my body with which I felt extreme discomfort, even anguish. I was sure I didn\u2019t want my baby and me to have the drugs, risks and major surgery that came with a caesarean if I could avoid them, and that left only one way out.</p> <p>Gender dysphoria is generally defined as a distressing sense of incongruity between one\u2019s body parts and one\u2019s inner sense of gender. Yet it may be experienced in many different ways, which explains in part why not every transition is alike. My gender dysphoria used to stem mainly from my breasts, and after my surgery I rarely experienced it any more. As long as I could be clothed from the waist down, I was happy to go about my daily business.</p> <p>My pregnant belly did not bring up feelings of gender dysphoria for me, either. Inwardly, I thanked the short, cisgender guys around town whose beer bellies could have just as easily been pregnancies: in public, I blended right in. My belly was a source of great excitement about our future little one, and my partner and I relished every kick. </p> <p>Yet from the first moments after peeing on a stick, the impending birth loomed large. Would it be so painful that I wouldn\u2019t even notice gender dysphoria about my nether regions and what they were doing? Or would the dysphoria be so bad that my body would tense up and refuse to open? My point of reference was pelvic exams, which for me have always caused excruciating pain and gender-related panic. </p> <p>My partner sensed the magnitude of my fear and suggested I talk to a therapist. My only previous therapy experience had been the kind where as a transgender person you try to present the expected stereotypical narrative about having played with trucks instead of dolls in childhood so that the psychologist will let you see the hormone doctor or surgeon. Not wanting to jeopardize my chances at receiving transition-related care in the future, I went to a different therapist this time. </p> <p>She loaned me a copy of Birthing From Within, a classic book with exercises meant to help the reader visualize birth in a positive manner. I obediently drew pictures, molded a clay figure, practiced vocalizing and journaled, but didn\u2019t feel much better.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/jun/20/transgender-dad-breastfeeding-pregnancy-trevor-macdonald\">Breastfeeding as a trans dad: \u2018A baby doesn\u2019t know what your pronouns are\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The therapist also convinced me, despite my anxiety and embarrassment, to do the obvious and talk to my midwives about the issue. I spent long, tortured appointments describing my gender dysphoria and my fears about giving birth, and my midwives eventually promised that they would do everything they could to help me feel in control of my healthcare.</p> <p>None of this advance planning ultimately solved my problem. My midwives brought their own fears to my birth, which amplified mine. During a pelvic check that triggered all the pain and traumatic gender dysphoria I was so scared of, my midwife broke my waters to speed things along. But then, in obvious horror, she mistook my slower adult pulse for the baby\u2019s (which should have been much faster). </p> <p>She imagined that she must have nicked a blood vessel in the amniotic sac, or that the umbilical cord was being pinched by the weight of the baby now that the cushion of fluid had been removed. It was my partner who checked my pulse at my wrist and pointed out her error. I remained terrified and in excruciating pain.</p> <p>Labor went on so long that another pair of midwives had to be called to relieve the first ones. They arrived with a student in tow. My original midwives remained with us, perhaps because of their emotional investment in the process, or maybe because they were eager to witness a trans birth. My doula and friend, whom I\u2019d asked to provide labor support, began a mantra, and I repeated her words: \u201cI welcome this sensation. I am opening. I am opening, and I welcome this sensation.\u201d </p> <p>Even if I didn\u2019t believe it at first, every time I said \u201copening\u201d, I could feel myself drawing inward and permitting the work of the contractions just a little more, in spite of the midwives\u2019 ringing cellphones and their frequent checks of the baby\u2019s heartbeat and my pulse, blood pressure and temperature. In the face of fear and exhaustion, I opened, and my first child was born in fine health.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/30/facing-my-fear-growing-up-in-broken-home-kids\">Facing my fear: I grew up in a broken home. I didn't want my kids to | Jaimie Seaton</a> </p> </aside>  <p>By the time we decided to have a second child, I knew much more about myself. I was no longer scared of my own body or how I would handle labor. Now I feared how my healthcare providers\u2019 actions would affect my gender dysphoria. I hated the feeling of my body being watched, examined and labeled. My anxiety wasn\u2019t about what my body needed to do, but how it would be seen and handled by others.</p> <p>In the midst of a fast and furious second labor, I chose not to call my midwife. It took my entire focus to keep from falling apart completely amid the intensity of labor; I couldn\u2019t fathom having to cope with an observer and medical checks as well. I felt my baby moving strongly inside me and I stayed solid and patient. I had an empowering, healing and healthy birth \u2013 alone.</p>",

  "<p>As presenter of <em>Woman\u2019s Hour</em> I\u2019m no stranger to the history of women who, over the centuries, have risen above the prejudice imposed on their gender, and whose lives began to be uncovered in the latter part of the 20th century as women\u2019s studies became an acceptable subject for academic research. But nowhere could I find a&#xa0;book which gathered together a group of those who had most excited my interest and admiration.</p> <p>Then came reports in November 2015 that it was proposed to cut feminism from the politics A-level syllabus. The suffragette movement was to be squeezed into a section on \u201cpressure groups\u201d and only one political thinker, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/womens-blog/2015/oct/05/original-suffragette-mary-wollstonecraft\" title=\"\">Mary Wollstonecraft</a>, was to be mentioned by name.

I can\u2019t find any women in this book except half a page on the suffragettes.\u201d That\u2019s&#xa0;my boy!</p> <p>Then I came across <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2010/nov/21/tristram-hunt-praises-serious-biographies\" title=\"\">Thomas Carlyle\u2019</a>s&#xa0;\u201cThe history of the world is but the biography of great men\u201d, written in 1840, and, in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/1999/jun/20/life1.lifemagazine1\" title=\"\">Steve Biddulph\u2019s <em>Raising Boys</em></a><em> </em>(1997), \u201cIt\u2019s important to remember that men built&#xa0;the planes, fought the wars, laid the railroad tracks, invented the cars, built the hospitals, invented the medicines and sailed the ships that made it all happen.\u201d</p> <p>It became vital to bring together a group of female warriors, poets, playwrights, painters, composers, campaigners, scientists, engineers, doctors and politicians for the benefit of all those young people who need to know that the history of Britain is the biography of great men <em>and</em> women.</p> <p>Fanny Burney is one such woman. Though certainly not the most accomplished novelist in the canon of English literature, she was successful in her day, often writing in her fiction about the difficulties faced by women in getting an education, taking control of their own lives and surviving the social whirl of the nouveau riche. Virginia Woolf called her \u201cthe mother of English fiction\u201d.</p> <p>Her diaries are phenomenal, giving us the most gossipy and often scandalous details of life in literary and&#xa0;intellectual London in the late 18th and early 19th centuries. She was at the centre of a circle that included Dr Johnson and his biographer, James Boswell. Her diaries give a far more intimate portrait of Dr Johnson than do those of the man she referred to rather scathingly as Bozzy.</p> <p>She also wrote one of the most courageous pieces of work I\u2019ve ever encountered. I read it around the time I, like so many 21 century women, was diagnosed with breast cancer.</p> <p>Burney\u2019s is the first example I\u2019ve come across of a woman writing about so intimate an event as a diagnosis of breast cancer and a mastectomy. Even today, when I wrote about my experience, it was regarded as a brave thing to do, though we no longer have any squeamish concerns about speaking the words \u201cbreast\u201d and \u201ccancer\u201d out loud. It was generally deemed to be helpful, making it clear that there\u2019s no shame attached to the diagnosis and it can be endured and survived.</p> <p>Burney was there first. She was diagnosed in Paris in 1810, at the age of&#xa0;58, when surgery was in its infancy and there was no effective anaesthetic. Her story was written to her sister, Esther, and was headed \u201cAccount from Paris of a terrible Operation \u2013 1812\u201d. First she explains that in August of 1810 she had a pain and a heaviness in her breast. She was referred to a surgeon and, at first, dismissed the concerns of her family and friends. Her&#xa0;letter is a cautionary tale. \u201cI relate this false confidence, now, as a warning to my dear Esther, my sisters and nieces, should any similar sensations excite similar alarm.\u201d</p> <p>She goes on to describe every horrific detail of what she endured: \u201cMonsieur Dubois placed me on the Mattrass, and spread a cambric handkerchief upon my face. It was transparent however, and I saw through it that the Bedstead was instantly surrounded by the seven men&#xa0;and my nurse.

Sixty-one matches have followed, yielding 30 victories, 17 draws and 14 defeats, two in cup finals. His team are fourth in the table, two points behind the leaders, Manchester City, having played <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/aug/14/arsenal-liverpool-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">Arsenal</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/aug/27/tottenham-hotspur-liverpool-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">Tottenham Hotspur</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/16/chelsea-liverpool-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">Chelsea</a> away. Liverpool have produced more shots, passes and sprints, and covered more distance than any other top-flight team and are joint leading scorers with 18 goals. At the corresponding stage of 2013-14, when they went closer than ever to winning the Premier League title, Brendan Rodgers\u2019s team had scored 11.</p> <p>Back then, Liverpool had Luis Su\u00e1rez returning from suspension to ignite their goals tally and style of play. And therein lies a difference with Klopp\u2019s Liverpool. The focus is no longer on individual talent such as Su\u00e1rez, Steven Gerrard or Fernando Torres to inspire and overcome the financial gap that exists even among the Premier League elite. Finance is not discussed in public by the current Liverpool manager. It is about the collective. Nothing else. Liverpool\u2019s players and public, responding to the manager\u2019s passion, acumen and honesty \u2013 something of a rarity among his peers \u2013 have bought into it, just as Klopp and his wife, Ulla, have embraced living on Merseyside. He gets the place.</p> <p>\u201cOne thing he has brought in is he will make us believe we can win whether we play Barcelona or whoever,\u201d Lallana explains. \u201cYou go out on the pitch thinking: \u2018We can win this by doing this.\u2019 You genuinely do believe him that every team is beatable.\u201d James Milner, another to flourish under Klopp, even at left\u2011back, has said: \u201cHe says things that maybe a lot of managers think but won\u2019t say. He is emotional and says what he thinks, rightly or wrongly. People can relate to that. It\u2019s not an act. That\u2019s the good thing \u2013 what you see is what you&#xa0;get.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Revisiting Klopp\u2019s first press conference it is striking how many pronouncements have materialised</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>It has not been a flawless 12 months \u2013 the second-half collapse in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/may/18/liverpool-sevilla-europa-league-final-match-report\" title=\"\">Europa League final against Sevilla</a> still stings the former Borussia Dortmund coach \u2013 and it is not all hugs and raucous laughter from a bloke fond of a pint in his local in Formby.</p> <p>Mamadou Sakho and Mario Balotelli can testify to the disciplinarian streak of a manager who absorbs the spotlight despite an aversion to it.

A new fitness coach and nutritionist arrived in the summer.</p> <p>\u201cFor me, the biggest change is the energy they have created and J\u00fcrgen in particular. I would describe him as an energy giver. He brings a positive energy and he expects the same from everyone else. That changes the dynamic. You don\u2019t go into a discussion wondering how the other person will react. He is very easy to get on with and that resonates through to the squad, the coaching staff, the fans and even the business. The measure of his impact has been in terms of the energy and spirit of everybody at the club. I don\u2019t think he endeavours to do that, it\u2019s just who he is and it\u2019s infectious.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2015/oct/09/jurgen-klopp-unveiled-new-liverpool-manager-live\" title=\"\">Revisiting Klopp\u2019s first press conference as Liverpool manager</a>, it is striking how many pronouncements made on that frenetic day have materialised.

Signalling a departure from the fixation with transfer committees and net&#xa0;spends, the new arrival insisted he was more concerned with developing players than how much money was available for fresh talent. Potential signings who hesitated about joining a club without Champions League football would not be pursued, a promise Klopp fulfilled this summer when withdrawing interest in Mario G\u00f6tze.</p> <p>The overriding message, however, was for the entire club to create conditions for \u201cemotional football\u201d to exist. \u201cIt is very important that we make it all closer,\u201d Klopp explained. \u201cIt is important they don\u2019t think: \u2018These are the good paid guys, we are the fans.\u2019 The atmosphere in the stadium is good but nobody is really enjoying themselves.\u201d</p> <p>Liverpool have adopted the counterpressing law, while business in two transfer windows (with this summer yielding a small profit) has highlighted Klopp\u2019s faith in the first-team core he inherited and an eye for a Bundesliga bargain.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d08e528f0b6c0ade35800dbca10527fb243b53bb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d08e528f0b6c0ade35800dbca10527fb243b53bb/0_132_4870_2922/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Liverpool fans\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Liverpool fans display a J\u00fcrgen Klopp banner before facing their manager\u2019s former club, Borussia Dortmund, in the Europa League.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: BPI/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But it is unity at Anfield, the feel around the place, that reflects his impact alongside <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/may/18/sevilla-liverpool-europa-league-final-basel-party\" title=\"\">two cup finals in seven months</a> and an imposing start to his first full Premier League season.

More important, he is the first to say the same about the team. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/aug/20/burnley-liverpool-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">Defeat at Burnley</a> and last Saturday\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/oct/01/jurgen-klopp-liverpool-premier-league-swansea\" title=\"\">first-half display at Swansea City</a> back that up.</p> <p>The night before being unveiled as Rodgers\u2019s successor, Klopp celebrated signing a three-year contract worth \u00a37m per annum (replaced by a new six-year deal in July) with dinner at the city\u2019s Hope Street hotel. Ayre, the Liverpool chairman, Tom Werner, and the backroom team who had survived the transition \u2013 Lijnders; Achterberg; the academy director, Alex Inglethorpe; the former head physio Chris Morgan and the first-team doctor, Andy Massey \u2013 were present.</p> <p>Liverpool\u2019s chief executive recalls: \u201cOther than myself and the owners, I don\u2019t think J\u00fcrgen had had a lot of exposure to the other people in the room but he spoke to everyone about what he had achieved at Dortmund and Mainz by bringing people together. That was what he focused on immediately \u2013 bringing the players and their families, the staff and their families, together.</p> <p>\u201cHe is inclusive of everybody at the club. That is crucial to him and plays a significant role. His interaction with the fans on a match day is part of that belief that we are all in it together. That\u2019s why he encourages fans to sing \u2013 or tells them when to stop. It is about bringing everyone along for the journey whether he is in a room of 10 people or a stadium of 50,000.\u201d</p> <p>That inclusivity extends to Liverpool\u2019s former players, taken by surprise when Klopp turned up unannounced at their Christmas party and spent hours listening to tales of yesteryear. Players\u2019 partners and children were invited to a warm-weather training camp in Tenerife during March. By contrast, access to Melwood \u2013 the \u201cHQ\u201d, as Klopp calls it \u2013 is more restricted for players\u2019 associates than under previous managers. Training sessions are intensive and tailored to mirror kick-off times. Small, simple details perhaps but as relevant to Klopp as his No10 dictating where to squeeze the space and options out of the&#xa0;opposition.</p> <p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t say the club itself has changed massively,\u201d Ayre suggests. \u201cJ\u00fcrgen wants to understand why or what you do in every situation. He\u2019ll either adapt to it or say he doesn\u2019t feel that works. He is very open and honest and it is very difficult to get in trouble if you\u2019re open and honest. It sounds really simple \u2013 and it is. I\u2019d love to say he\u2019s changed things by sprinkling magic dust but it really is very simple \u2013 good communication, good collaboration, good energy and good spirit. He\u2019s an easy character to deal with. There\u2019s no agenda and no ego \u2013 that\u2019s not what the guy is about. You can say he\u2019s one of the biggest managerial names in world football but it doesn\u2019t play out that way and he doesn\u2019t act that way. Externally there seems to be a general feeling among people of: \u2018What are you hiding?\u2019 But what you see is what you get. It is normal dealing with him. Whether you\u2019re a steward in the tunnel at Anfield or the CEO, he\u2019s the same with&#xa0;everyone.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve worked with five managers at Liverpool now and three or four at other clubs, and the reality is managers can make life difficult because they don\u2019t want to be honest or own up to their own decisions but there is none of that with J\u00fcrgen. We have had differences of opinion but you always feel you can have an honest conversation with J\u00fcrgen and it wouldn\u2019t change the relationship in any way. He\u2019s straightforward, honest and a pleasure to work with. That\u2019s how it should be when you are all striving for the same thing, success for the football club on and off the pitch.\u201d</p>",

  "<p>\u201cHer books\u2019 sensational success made the search for her identity inevitable. It also left financial clues that speak by themselves.\u201d So writes Claudio Gatti in the New York Review of Books. We know that money talks, but personal bank accounts have nothing to say for themselves unless a journalist is doing the ventriloquism.</p> <p>These accounts weren\u2019t the Panama Papers or bungs or bribes or secret payments to secret mistresses. The woman in question wasn\u2019t a politician or a Berlusconi-style businessman. She&#xa0;paid her taxes. She wished to live quietly and get on with her work. She is the writer we know as Elena Ferrante.</p> <p>Gatti tells us that a decade ago a team at La Sapienza University, Rome, analysed the books using software programs and decided that they were written by Domenico Starnone \u2013 a&#xa0;writer who happens to be the husband of the woman who is and is&#xa0;not Elena Ferrante.</p> <p>That must have been a relief to those who still want to believe that Branwell Bront\u00eb wrote everything for his mousy sisters, or that Willy really did write Colette\u2019s masterpieces, and that only a man can write about women \u2013 or write about anything, which is, after all, the basis of the literature myth. JK Rowling knew boys wouldn\u2019t read her books if she was called Joanne. Later, wanting a&#xa0;fresh start from both Harry Potter and from herself, she chose the name Robert Galbraith \u2013 definitely male, and soon unmasked.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/oct/31/elena-ferrante-literary-sensation-nobody-knows\">Elena Ferrante: the global literary sensation nobody knows</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The not-so-wise men at La Sapienza (note that Wisdom is female \u2013 Sofia is her Greek and medieval incarnations) could not eliminate gender bias from&#xa0;the analysis of their software program, and I am sure that we will soon hear that Signor Starnone is the \u201creal\u201d author, by marriage, of the Neapolitan Quartet.</p> <p>Why? Because at the bottom of this so-called investigation into Ferrante\u2019s identity is an obsessional outrage at the success of a writer \u2013 female \u2013 who decided to write, publish and promote her books on her own terms.</p> <p>It is only 150 years in the UK and 110 years in Italy since women were able to own property, earn and keep their own money, and stand under the law equal to men. Women got the vote in Italy late \u2013 1946 \u2013 and Italy is still a Catholic country with strong patriarchial attitudes towards women. Gatti is no doubt a secular journalist, but listening to him talk about his scoop on the BBC \u2013 his pompous unthinking sexism, his desire to discredit the creator of both Ferrante and Ferrante\u2019s books, what he calls her \u201clies\u201d about her mother, tells us a lot more about him than about his subject. Which is not a surprise, because this is all about him. This is his shot at the limelight. Claudio Gatti is a nobody with too much time on his hands. Elena Ferrante is a writer with worlds at her fingertips.</p> <p>And I go on calling Elena Ferrante Elena Ferrante because that is who she wishes to be. She has been very clear about why she has chosen to be two people \u2013 one of whom can be known through her books, and one of whom cannot be known at all. Writing is an act of splitting \u2013 like mercury. Writers are multiple personalities. This is clear when we create other characters \u2013 it can be confusing when the character we create is ourselves.</p> <p>My first novel <em>Oranges Are Not The Only Fruit</em> uses a character called Jeanette. I like to read myself as a fiction as well as a fact. It is creatively freeing. Henry Miller, Philip Roth, Paul Auster and Milan Kundera have all used themselves as their own aliases. When men do it, it is called meta-fiction and part of their playful experiment. When women do it, it is called autobiography.</p> <p>Karl Ove Knausgaard writes about himself with monomaniacal fixation. Yet this does not reduce him \u2013 it expands him, because his claim to be his own artwork is accepted. Antony Gormley uses his own body as the cast for his forms. Tracey Emin has determined her own space in much the same way \u2013 as subject and object \u2013 but her reception has been very different. Women who say, as Beckett did, I and&#xa0;Not I, this is me and not me, this&#xa0;is&#xa0;myself but it is someone else, are&#xa0;driven back from the larger open spaces of the artwork to the smaller spaces of the self.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Gatti has swivelled the lens so that we are looking at the writer instead of looking at the work in its own right</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>This is exactly what has happened to Ferrante. By forcing us to concentrate on biography and bank accounts, on the writer and not the work, Gatti has invaded the space that belongs to the work. He has swivelled the lens so that we are looking at the writer through his eyes instead of looking at the work in its own right. He justifies this by telling us that \u201cFerrante has relinquished her right to disappear behind her books.\u201d</p> <p>This is the \u201cshort skirt \u2013 she was asking for it\u201d \u2013 argument. According to Gatti, inventing a life for the fictitious Ferrante, especially inventing a mother, is lying; in fact it is publicity seeking \u2013 so it\u2019s double lying, because she says she doesn\u2019t want publicity \u2013 therefore she deserves all she gets.</p> <p>In the Facebook world where privacy is an anachronism and nothing is real unless it is photographed and uploaded, Ferrante\u2019s desire to remain hidden in plain sight needed only one&#xa0;response: respect. Gatti did not respect&#xa0;Ferrante, and neither did the&#xa0;New York Review of Books. This&#xa0;is&#xa0;Hello! magazine journalism.</p> <p>The stripping and parading of Elena&#xa0;Ferrante is violent and crude. Creatively it might destroy her (she has&#xa0;said she cannot write without anonymity), so it is a deliberately malicious act, too. Rightly, around the&#xa0;world, most people seem disgusted&#xa0;by what has happened.</p> <p>There\u2019s an essay by TS Eliot from&#xa0;1919 called \u201cTradition and the Individual Talent\u201d. He talks about personality \u2013 and how creative work is&#xa0;a&#xa0;means of escaping personality. This is&#xa0;the I Not I that is difficult to explain. You lose yourself, yet you are most clearly yourself in the creative act. It\u2019s&#xa0;the Indian rope trick.</p> <p>Ferrante claimed the freedom of I&#xa0;Not I. I hope she will know, in time, that no one can take that from her by force, as Gatti has tried to do. It is her right to claim it, her right to keep it. Whoever else she is, she will always be&#xa0;Elena Ferrante.</p>",

We deal with new and growing businesses every day, and the founders are overwhelmingly rational, competent and highly experienced. Sure, this can often go hand in hand with a mindset that others find hard to follow. Entrepreneurs are not fond of abiding by the rules, but it\u2019s this bravery, creativity and energy that enables them to challenge convention successfully. And on the whole, this is rooted in the urge to change the world for the better in some way. </p> <p>Far from being rudderless or narcissistic, most entrepreneurs are driven by a clear vision and solid purpose. </p> <p>The founders we help to raise finance to grow are more likely to be in their late 30s, rather than 20-something hipsters. Many come from senior roles in financial services, consultancy or technology, and are equipped with the strategic and leadership skills that are pivotal to success in any industry. Many already have an expert understanding of the field \u2013 Ajan Reginald of biotech firm Celixir, for example, was previously global head of emerging technologies at healthcare company Roche. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It\u2019s hard starting a business ... there\u2019s nowhere to hide and it takes a special type of person to do it</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>We\u2019re also seeing more second-time entrepreneurs pitching on our platform, such as Tom Bloomfield who launched challenger bank Monzo after co-founding GoCardless or Alex Zivoder who raised \u00a34m for fintech innovator goHenry, after scaling companies like Expedia, viagogo and Lynda.com. </p> <p>Startup founders have to be a little bit crazy to see things differently, chuck in a well-paid job and embrace uncertainty and sacrifice. And it\u2019s a tough position to be in. Entrepreneurs need courage and determination to take risks, be creative and solve difficult problems \u2013 and this may sometimes manifest itself in behaviour that could be seen as impulsive or frantic. But this should be embraced, not knocked. It\u2019s hard starting a business, very hard; there\u2019s nowhere to hide and it takes a special type of person to do it.</p> <p>If an entrepreneur lacks experience in the industry they\u2019re launching into, or is a first-time entrepreneur, the best way to channel that energy in an effective way is to surround themselves with an expert team. Making mistakes is not something that should be seen as a negative \u2013 if you\u2019re not making mistakes, you\u2019re not taking risks, and changing the status quo is impossible without doing that.</p> <p>Jane Ni Dhulchaointigh, founder of Sugru, developed the mouldable glue she invented with the help of two retired scientists.

Many would hire experienced employees if they could afford to, but that often isn\u2019t an option. There\u2019s nothing wrong with nurturing and empowering young people to progress and develop. As the business matures, this will create the foundation of a strong, diverse leadership culture \u2013 at Crowdcube we have an ex-intern sitting on the management team alongside someone from Google, who joined us later.</p> <p>Creating a culture in which new enterprise can flourish means not leaving everything to the steady, risk-averse \u201cadults\u201d. Entrepreneurs won\u2019t get everything right all the time. But maybe taking a shot, getting it wrong and reacting quickly is better than being ultra-conservative or overly precise. </p> <p>Perfection is often described as the enemy of progress; well, entrepreneurs are gloriously imperfect, even the most celebrated ones. But they undeniably move us forward and change the world we live in. We should respect those who give it a crack.

  "<p>A Congolese king has introduced a specialised Wi-Fi network to a remote island after testing it in a similarly rugged and windswept environment: an estate in Scotland managed by a representative of Queen Elizabeth. </p> <p>An estimated 250,000 people live the island of Idjwi in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), which has been referred to as a \u201cforgotten population\u201d by the world\u2019s media.</p> <p>There is no broadband infrastructure. Its benefits would be limited in any case: fewer than 10 homes on the island in the centre of Lake Kivu have a computer, while the cost of 3G and smartphones mean mobile internet is too expensive for most citizens, many of whom live on just a dollar a day.</p> <p>But since May, 10,000 islanders have been able to access the free Wi-Fi being beamed across the lake by a powerful antenna. It\u2019s a system otherwise known as \u201cmesh Wi-Fi\u201d, which starts with one connection \u2013 in this case in the town of Bukavu on the mainland 40 miles (60km) away \u2013 and then the signal is transmitted by a series of masts.</p> <p>The new Wi-Fi supplies a kiosk in Bugarula, the island\u2019s biggest village, which has five tablets and four computers. People can also pick up a signal within 100 metres of each mast. Unlike broadband, mesh Wi-Fi doesn\u2019t require cables to be installed and people can make <a href=\"https://www.fjordnet.com/workdetail/bringing-the-internet-to-africas-forgotten-island/\">homemade antennae</a> out of scrap metal to share the connection.</p> <p>The system was recently heralded Kevin Kelly, executive editor of Wired magazine, as a <a href=\"http://observer.com/2016/06/kevin-kelly-wants-people-to-embrace-the-futures-technological-promise/\">technology to \u201cshape our future</a>\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ffefe765eeee5b946909369fca8b61665f944487\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ffefe765eeee5b946909369fca8b61665f944487/183_0_1317_790/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Equipment for mesh wifi arrives\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Equipment for mesh Wi-Fi arrives.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Fjord/First Light</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>The Scottish test </h2> <p>Fjord, the <a href=\"https://www.fjordnet.com/\">innovation consultancy company based in the UK</a> and <a href=\"https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=http-3A__www.ensemblepourladifference.org_&amp;d=DQMFaQ&amp;c=eIGjsITfXP_y-DLLX0uEHXJvU8nOHrUK8IrwNKOtkVU&amp;r=DGERBqedq3OrbUodKhBUitwxQWhqUyneBjUS1YGQ0FI&amp;m=uSXO7EHXwagS3z07Pof-kXavTRH1pr9ZrQG3MDLG2YM&amp;s=DevzplHY-aVZbxwheKhb6ZdCrhFkMs6gyJhwu1l1N4M&amp;e=\">Ensemble Pour La Difference</a>, a social incubator based in Bukavu that are delivering the project for the Idjwi king Gervais Rubenga, wanted to test the system before shipping it out to east Africa, which is where the Brahan estate near Inverness comes in.</p> <p>It was the ideal testing ground, thanks to the remoteness and limited interference from other signals, and the fact that <a href=\"https://www.fjordnet.com/workdetail/bringing-the-internet-to-africas-forgotten-island/\">the nephew of Lord-Lieutenant of Ross and Cromarty</a>, who manages the land, had already set up a mesh Wi-Fi system for her community.</p> <p>The wind, rain and terrain were similar too, so much so that Patrick Byamungu, who leads the project in Idjwi for Ensemble Pour la Diff\u00e9rence and travelled to Scotland for the test, says he could have been back in DRC. \u201cIt helped that the people were kind, friendly and keen to help,\u201d he says.</p> <p>After successfully setting up a mesh system that delivered fast internet, the Fjord team drew up a plan to install a tower that would take the internet from Bukavu across the lake directly to the centre of the island. </p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://vimeo.com/173611176\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/173611176\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>The system is tested in Scotland.</figcaption> </figure>   <p>Up and running in May, the new connection has has brought many changes to Idjwi.

The king and the UK team want to keep basic health information and news available free by charging residents $2 a month to browse Facebook, YouTube and other sites.</p> <p>For Fjord, the ultimate goal of the project is to hand full ownership to the residents. However, while they are introducing new technologies \u201cit will take a little time for people to find their feet\u201d, Byamungu says.</p> <p>While Byamungu says that accurate weather information has been the most immediate and obvious benefit of the project, he has also been encouraged to see everyone from young people to traders and teachers connecting with the world. \u201cWhen I travel I see that everyone has this luxury, it should be the same on the island,\u201d he says. <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p>",

Good, decent, honest, hardworking people who sought professional services to be financially responsible.</p> <p>I have seen harrowing outcomes firsthand.

But just what is it about cities and their streets that makes them such effective bases for a successful brand? </p> <p>By highlighting the subcultures and cities from which they have emerged, streetwear brands anchor their roots in authentic subcultures. This type of marketing targets millennials in particular, who, it is <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/karlmoore/2014/08/14/authenticity-the-way-to-the-millennials-heart/#2d86d27c444a\">said</a>, respond well to brand authenticity.

Think high fashion and Paris, or cars and Germany.\u201d</p> <p>It may be the belief that urban subcultures are founded on love, rather than money, that makes them seem authentic. While it is possible to find ways of making such activities lucrative (the Banksy film <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/mar/04/exit-through-the-gift-shop-review\">Exit Through the Gift Shop</a>, for instance), on the whole they\u2019re seen as coming from the grassroots, and unfunded. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>In the eyes of the millennial, authenticity equates to edgy and upcoming cultural hubs</p> <footer> <cite>Dimitrios Tsivrikos</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Europe\u2019s largest street art and graffiti festival, <a href=\"http://www.upfest.co.uk/\">Upfest</a>, is still free, and according to its organiser, Stephen Hayles, \u201cthe ethos of the festival is all about inclusion,\u201d he says. \u201cWe like to include as many artists as possible, and also make it as accessible as possible. With the art being on the street, the artist is giving up their work for the people to view and comment on. There\u2019s a self-indulgence on the part of the artist, because they want to put their work out there, but also it is a gift that the artist is giving.

When hugely successful streetwear brands invoke their origins in cities and their subcultures, they reinforce this rags to riches narrative in the consumer\u2019s mind, and present it as a tantalising possibility for them also.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"801474989f2552af3c7e6d3a52be3b34cac8a722\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/801474989f2552af3c7e6d3a52be3b34cac8a722/0_0_3072_2048/1000.jpg\" alt=\"House of Vans event\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The House of Vans event space was an attempt by the company to reconnect with its urban roots.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Vans</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.supremenewyork.com/\">Supreme</a> provides a good example of how a brand can successfully capitalise on its origins in an urban subculture. In April 1994, James Jebbia (who had previously helped to open Stussy\u2019s flagship store in New York) opened Supreme on Lafayette Street in downtown Manhattan. The spacious shop, which cost around $12,000 to open, stocked clothes for an older demographic, which skateboarding brands had previously neglected. The shop has since grown into a brand, and in 2012 James Jebbia\u2019s net worth was estimated at $40m.</p> <p>Although Supreme now has a global audience, it remains exclusive with only 10 stores worldwide, six of which are in Japan. As well as having a large following in Japan, they boast an impressive online community of users that discuss, buy, and re-sell Supreme product. SupTalk, a popular Facebook page for Europe\u2019s Supreme fans, has over 60,000 members. </p> <p> Vans, which is now owned by VF Corporation (and according to <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/forbes/welcome/?/sites/abrambrown/2015/11/23/how-vans-shoes-became-a-quiet-fashion-juggernaut/&amp;toURL=http://www.forbes.com/sites/abrambrown/2015/11/23/how-vans-shoes-became-a-quiet-fashion-juggernaut/&amp;refURL=https://www.google.co.uk/&amp;referrer=https://www.google.co.uk/\">Forbes</a>, in 2015 was expected to make $2.3bn in sales), created the House of Vans events space in an effort to remain engaged with its subcultural origins. The site in Brooklyn hosts live music, art shows, and skateboarding events.</p> <p>Doug Palladini, Vans Global Brand President, says: \u201cHouse of Vans can be a large, permanent space in London, or a pop-up, moveable space winding its way across Asia, as long as the brand comes to life at every stop. This allows us to strategically place ourselves, down to the right street corner, and stand out with a bespoke, \u2018can\u2019t miss\u2019 experience.\u201d</p> <p>However, brands are not always successful in their engagements with cities and their subcultures.

  "<p>The sound of chainsaws fills the forest of Bruny Island in Tasmania as a group of 30 arborists cut into white peppermint trees, which provide essential nesting for the endangered swift parrot.</p> <p>The arborists, from Victoria and Sydney, paid for their own flights and volunteered their time to climb into more than 100 trees and carve holes in them to provide safe nesting for the birds, which are fussy about where they will breed.</p> <p>Dejan Stojanovic, a conservation biologist who researches the parrots and is dedicated to preserving their environment, struggles to contain his excitement as he speaks over the chainsaws to Guardian Australia on Friday. He hopes the human-made hollows will lead to a breeding season boon for the birds.</p> <p>\u201cMy research has shown that of the naturally available tree hollows in the Tasmanian forest, only 5% are suitable for swift parrots,\u201d he says.</p> <p>\u201cThe parrots are really picky about where they will nest, and the holes must have certain characteristics or the birds won\u2019t use them. The average nest is between 40 and 50cm deep, and the entrance hole in the tree needs to be small, about 5cm in diameter.</p> <p>\u201cThe birds need that small entrance to prevent Tasmanian predators (which typically have fat heads, like sugar gliders) from getting into them.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"109336e4ce89d78879cfa065cb06f4a3d366743d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/109336e4ce89d78879cfa065cb06f4a3d366743d/0_0_640_480/500.jpg\" alt=\"Arborists carve hollows into Tasmanian peppermint trees in the hope endangered swift parrots will nest in them.\" width=\"500\" height=\"375\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Arborists carve hollows into Tasmanian white peppermint trees in the hope endangered swift parrots will nest in them.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andrew McKernan</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Habitat loss owing to logging, illegal firewood cutting and clearing land for farming and housing means that safe and appropriate breeding spaces for the birds are increasingly rare. While numbers are hard to ascertain, Stojanovic says there are only about 2,000 of the parrots left. Habitat loss has accelerated their deaths to sugar gliders, which kill and eat the female parrot while she incubates her eggs, or return over several nights to feast on nestlings. </p> <p>But Stojanovic\u2019s research team has had an exciting week. In a further attempt to encourage breeding, they launched a <a href=\"https://pozible.com/project/193891\">crowdfunding campaign </a>through Pozible last year to build sugar glider-proof nest boxes. They raised $73,000 and by the end of the year had placed hundreds of nest boxes throughout the forest.</p> <p>Last week Stojanovic checked 40 of the boxes and found 11 of them occupied by the parrots. He has climbed up to check inside three of those 11 boxes so far, finding one containing six eggs, another containing four and one with a nest chamber prepared, signalling a parrot was about to lay. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/apr/01/wont-somebody-think-of-the-swift-parrots\">Won't somebody think of the swift parrots? | First Dog on the Moon</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cIt was three out of three,\u201d Stojanovic says. \u201cI\u2019ve only ever recorded one natural nest with six eggs in it before, and it\u2019s another sign it will be a great year for the parrots. It\u2019s nice to be able to say to people who donated to our campaign that their money has gone to good use, and it\u2019s such a relief for us.\u201d</p> <p>A combination of factors are working in the parrots\u2019 favour this year, he says. Their food source, blue gums, are flowering heavily, providing a food bonanza in an area of the island protected from sugar gliders. And, thanks to the efforts of researchers, there are more nesting options available to the birds than ever.</p> <p>But Stojanovic warns the parrots are nomads which move to different areas of Tasmania according to where blue gums are blooming. Deploying arborists to climb trees and carve out nesting holes each season according to where the birds are, combined with building the nesting boxes, is an expensive and time-intensive endeavour.</p> <p>\u201cThis is a Band-Aid solution and a desperate attempt to buy time for these birds by giving them a reprieve for their habitat loss,\u201d he says. \u201cBut what we need to do long term is preserve mature Tasmanian forest. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>What we need to do long term is preserve mature Tasmanian forest</p> <footer> <cite>Dejan Stojanovic</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cWhen you consider that this is the best year for the birds since 2005 in terms of conditions and food supply, that\u2019s 11 years between drinks.</p> <p>\u201cIt is highly likely that next year the blue gums won\u2019t flower as well as they did this year and they might not for another five years, forcing the birds on to the mainland to breed where there is less habitat and more predators.\u201d</p> <p>Andrew McKernan, an arborist with Melbourne Tree Care, spent Friday ascending the peppermint trees, which he says had been chosen because they aren\u2019t endangered and are near to the blue gums.</p> <p>He heard Stojanovic on the ABC\u2019s Radio National program early this year talking about the parrots and their natural habitat being destroyed by illegal firewood cutters.

  "<p>Compare and contrast two speeches: Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s to the Labour party conference in Liverpool, and the prime minister\u2019s to the Conservative party conference in Birmingham. Both mention housing, understandably: the housing crisis, which affects every part of the market and has a direct impact on people\u2019s lives and voting priorities, is now impossible for politicians to ignore.</p> <p>Corbyn mentioned housing nine times, Theresa May, eight, but the content of their messages couldn\u2019t be more different.</p> <p>Both spoke of fairness but from different angles. Corbyn stated that Labour will build more than 1m new homes \u2013 at least half of them council houses \u2013 \u201cand we will control private rents, so we can give every British family that basic human right: a decent home.\u201d For Labour, fairness means everyone having the same access to basic needs, and housing is truly one of the most basic but often denied needs, regardless of their position in society.</p> <p>For May, fairness means \u201cmeritocracy\u201d, a theme she returned to throughout her speech. The term, coined by British sociologist Michael Young to satirise a dystopian future in which elites ignore social class and divisions by fetishising intellect and merit, has been adopted wholesale by political elites without any sense of irony. <br></p> <p>Young lamented this shift <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2001/jun/29/comment\">back in 2001 in a paper</a>. It is handy for those who wish to comfort themselves over the divisions that remain in society if they can think that the have-nots in modern Britain are not fettered by intersecting oppressions of class, race, poverty and economics, but simply undeserving. Extreme wealth disparities are far easier to justify if those at the top can salve their consciences by convincing themselves they have acquired their comforts on merit.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/housing-network/2016/sep/29/social-housing-labour-shadow-housing-minister\">Council houses change lives: we will build them</a> </p> </aside>  <p>May\u2019s speech also made no mention of council housing: Tory Britain is focused on home ownership above all else. As <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/housing-network/2016/oct/05/conservative-party-conference-hope-housing-crisis\">Colin Wiles wrote recently</a>, housing minister Gavin Barwell has made conciliatory noises outside the main speeches about the position of social housing; but in May\u2019s speech it didn\u2019t merit a mention: the sole focus was on home ownership as the aspiration and option for voters.</p> <p>Barwell also managed to confuse many by <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/tory-council-housing-housebuilding-gavin-barwell-conference-live-2016-a7341946.html\">claiming council housing increased inequality</a>. It\u2019s a muddled argument that claims people are poor because they live in social housing, and not vice versa. In reality, as Labour\u2019s shadow housing minister <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/housing-network/2016/sep/29/social-housing-labour-shadow-housing-minister\">Teresa Pearce has argued</a>, social housing offers security, and opportunity through affordable rents.</p> <p>Despite May\u2019s claims of centrism, her speech was skewed massively to the right. Her vision of a Britain that \u201cworks for everyone\u201d clearly did not include migrants. In the speech itself she blamed migrant workers for pushing down wages, while home secretary Amber Rudd called for firms to list the numbers of foreign workers they employed, and health secretary Jeremy Hunt claimed the Tories would work towards an NHS that only employed medics born in the UK.</p> <p>It simply isn\u2019t true that immigration <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/housing-network/2016/jan/25/is-immigration-causing-the-uk-housing-crisis\">has negatively affected the cost of housing</a>. In many areas immigration has lowered local rents, and since one of Britain\u2019s big problems is the lack of a skilled workforce, without migrant workers house-building would falter significantly. If we cannot build the houses we need now, what hope do we have when Britain becomes a country that tells the many migrant bricklayers and labourers we rely on that they are neither welcome nor needed?</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/housing-network/2016/jan/25/is-immigration-causing-the-uk-housing-crisis\">Is immigration causing the UK housing crisis?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Many of the Tory pronouncements at conference were detached from reality: rather than attainable and evidence-based policies that can boost people\u2019s quality of life, such as Labour\u2019s plan for more social housing, better private-renting conditions, more local authority building powers, the Conservatives envisaged a rightwing dreamworld. </p> <p>Aiming for a Britain in which everyone owns a home ignores the fact that right now many have no home to even rent, and far more struggle to pay their rent each month.

  "<p>In 2013 I published a letter from CH of Christchurch in Dorset who reckoned she was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2013/jun/30/coop-cheque\">entitled to keep \u00a335,000 from a cheque that was cancelled eight days after she had paid it in</a>. The bank, the Co-operative, disagreed and, in spite of its own terms and conditions, reclaimed the payment from her account.</p> <p>CH appealed to the Financial Ombudsman Service, which awarded her \u00a3500 because of the Co-op\u2019s delays and misinformation. However, the ombudsman declared that, despite those terms and conditions, it would not be \u201creasonable\u201d for her to keep the full \u00a335,000.</p> <p>CH took her case to the small claims court and, in a ruling that has repercussions for banks and consumers, she won. The argument centred on the little-known and whimsically named rule, \u201ccertainty of fate\u201d, introduced by the Office of Fair Trading in 2007.</p> <p>It allows customers to keep the proceeds of a cheque once six working days have passed since it was paid in, even if that cheque bounces. Up to then, the bank can debit a deposit if the cheque fails to clear.</p> <p>The rule was designed to protect customers from fraudulent transactions, but this case shows that it can also lead to customers reaping huge rewards from a bank\u2019s incompetence.</p> <p>CH had deposited a cheque for \u00a335,000 made out by her mother on <br> 5 December 2012. When it had not appeared in her account eight days later, the bank admitted that it did not know where it was. Concerned it had gone astray, on 13 December the mother cancelled the original cheque and CH paid in a replacement. The next day two credits of \u00a335,000 showed on the account.</p> <p>The bank confirmed that one of the cheques had cleared, but it couldn\u2019t be certain which one. However, it assured CH, over several phone calls, that the first \u00a335,000 credit was hers to keep under the \u201ccertainty of fate principle\u201d, but that both sums would be debited from her mother\u2019s account.</p> <p>CH therefore advised her mother to cancel the second cheque so that she would only be liable for one payment, and withdrew the first sum.</p> <p>Two days later the bank changed its mind about honouring the first cheque and debited \u00a335,000 from the account, claiming \u201cunjust enrichment\u201d and, as CH wrote at the time, \u201capplying massive fees for what it now called an unauthorised overdraft\u201d.</p> <p>She discovered she was overdrawn by \u00a326,154.</p> <p>The Co-op, while still insisting that one of the cheques had cleared, reclaimed the \u00a335,000 which she had already withdrawn by helping itself to \u00a39,000 of savings left in the account and imposing fees and interest for the \u201cunauthorised\u201d overdraft to cover the balance. After CH contacted <em>The Observer</em> the Co-op repaid the fees and interest and awarded her \u00a3150 in goodwill, increased by the ombudsman to \u00a3500.</p> <p>CH decided to apply to the small claims court for her \u00a39,000 of savings that the bank had taken, although given that she had already withdrawn the \u00a335,000 she was not out of pocket.</p> <p>\u201cBanks make the rules and the rules are clear that I was entitled to keep the money under the \u2018certainty of fate\u2019 principle,\u201d she says. \u201cIt seems that banks manipulate their own rules to avoid losses made by their inefficiency.\u201d</p> <p>The judge at Bournemouth county court agreed. Not only has he awarded the \u00a39,000, he concluded that she would have been entitled under the Co-ops\u2019 own terms and conditions to keep the entire \u00a335,000.</p> <p>The Co-op was refused leave to appeal. Since then, CH has asked the Co-op for the balance of the \u00a335,000 under the six-day rule, but has been refused. \u201cThe bank does not agree with the judgment and believes it is wrong in law,\u201d says a Co-op spokesperson. \u201cHowever, the bank has paid the amount awarded by the court and will not be offering any further sums and considers the matter closed.\u201d</p> <p>CH says she pursued the matter as a point of principle. \u201cI hope that other people who have been obliged to wait, at their bank\u2019s pleasure, for their cheques to be cleared whilst being told a lot of nonsense about clearing times can now take heart from the court\u2019s decision.\u201d</p>",

  "<p>A rusting, unusable boat, abandoned at sea. Its crew left to fend for themselves 70 nautical miles off the coast of Guinea, west Africa, without radio or safety equipment, abandoned by the boat\u2019s operator.</p> <p>This is just one shocking story of a global fishing industry that is rife with incidents of abuse, murder and slavery. Human rights exploitation in the seafood sector is a tragedy that has been documented for a decade. </p> <p>The abandoned boat story dates <a href=\"http://www.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/zombie-ships/\" rel=\"nofollow\">back to 2006</a>; while a <a href=\"http://www.no-trafficking.org/reports_docs/siren/siren_cb3.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">UN survey</a> (pdf) dating back to 2009 found that nearly two-thirds of migrants aboard Thai fishing boats reported seeing a fellow worker murdered. In a few, fortunate cases, people have been rescued, such as the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/aug/01/slave-ships-papua-new-guinea-hunt-burmese-men-trawler\">Burmese crewmen</a> found enslaved in cages in Indonesia last year.</p> <p>This human crisis at the heart of the seafood sector was the topic of a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2016/jul/18/slavery-in-the-seafood-supply-chain-what-can-we-do-about-it-event\">seminar discussion</a>, hosted by the Guardian and supported by Seafish, a non-departmental government body. A panel of experts was chaired by Guardian journalist Annie Kelly.</p> <h2>Boycotting slavery</h2> <p>For Thailand, the issue became more acute last year, when the EU threatened it with a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/apr/21/eu-threatens-thailand-with-trade-ban-over-illegal-fishing\">trade ban</a> on seafood imports if it did not tackle illegal fishing and labour abuses. An EU-wide ban could cost the country <a href=\"http://www.eubusiness.com/news-eu/thailand-fishing.12m8/\" rel=\"nofollow\">$1bn (\u00a3780m) a year</a> in lost trade. Companies and retailers <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2014/jun/10/supermarket-prawns-thailand-produced-slave-labour\">linked to slavery</a> via their supply chains, including Tesco, Aldi, Iceland and the Co-op, have also been under pressure to boycott the country\u2019s exports. </p> <p>\u201cI have never witnessed anything remotely like what was going on in Thailand \u2013 in case after case you were talking violent abuse and murder,\u201d said Steve Trent, co-founder of the Environmental Justice Foundation. \u201cThese were not isolated cases. It was institutionalised in the seafood sector.\u201d He blames the scale of the problem on a poor culture of enforcement in Thailand and the inherent vulnerability of its seafood workforce; 90% are migrants, many of whom have been trafficked into the country.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-canonical-url=\"https://soundcloud.com/tomlevitt/slavery-in-the-seafood-supply-chain-what-can-we-do-about-it\" data-alt=\"A podcast\">  <iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/285850922&amp;color=ff5500&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false\"></iframe> <figcaption>A podcast of the Guardian debate on slavery in the seafood supply chain - September 2016</figcaption> </figure>  <p><a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/27/world/outlaw-ocean-thailand-fishing-sea-slaves-pets.html?hp&amp;action=click&amp;pgtype=Homepage&amp;module=photo-spot-region&amp;region=top-news&amp;WT.nav=top-news&amp;_r=5\" rel=\"nofollow\">Thai Union</a>, the world\u2019s biggest tuna exporter and owner of the John West brand, is one of the brands alleged to have benefited from the use of labour.

But the company\u2019s sustainability director, Darian McBain, said boycotting Thailand would achieve little. \u201cCompanies might say they\u2019ll just source from another country that has no slavery in their supply chain, but I\u2019d like to know what that country is. This is an issue that occurs across the fishing industry worldwide.\u201d</p> <p>By staying put in Thailand, companies can have more impact, said Libby Woodhatch, head of advocacy at Seafish. \u201c[Companies] have the buying power collectively to make a difference and ensure [slavery] isn\u2019t acceptable and that regulations are enforced,\u201d she said.</p> <h2>Threat of lawsuits</h2> <p>Since the publication of damning investigations by the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2014/jun/10/supermarket-prawns-thailand-produced-slave-labour\">Guardian</a> and Associated Press, multinationals, including <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/nov/24/nestle-admits-forced-labour-in-seafood-supply-chain\">Nestl\u00e9</a> and <a href=\"http://tu.listedcompany.com/newsroom/20160615-tu-modern-slavery-en.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">Thai Union</a>, have openly admitted to problems with slave labour and human rights abuse in their supply chains. McBain sees little benefit to this transparency. \u201cThere are a lot of companies you have never heard of that are dealing with seafood. That isn\u2019t to say they are being more transparent with their supply chains or investing more into them, it\u2019s just that you\u2019ve never heard of them,\u201d she said. \u201cSome of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/feb/26/obama-revives-anti-slavery-law-to-target-thailands-seafood-exports\">US legislation</a> like the Trade Facilitation and Trade Enforcement Act actually makes you more cautious about what you say about what you find in your supply chain, rather than encouraging transparent dialogue.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet element--supporting\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/yukilo/status/776351188291903488\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"> <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Great panel on slavery in seafood industry \"it seems we care more about the fish than the fishermen\" <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/slaveryevent?src=hash\" rel=\"nofollow\">#slaveryevent</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/MrRdBqgYmu\" rel=\"nofollow\">pic.twitter.com/MrRdBqgYmu</a></p>\u2014 Yuki Lo (@yukilo) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/yukilo/status/776351188291903488\" rel=\"nofollow\">September 15, 2016</a> </blockquote> </figure>  <p>For human rights barrister and UN expert on trafficking Parosha Chandran, it is not media coverage that companies should worry about but legal action from individual victims of slavery or human rights abuses. While the <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2015/dec/14/modern-slavery-act-explained-business-responsibility-supply-chain\">Modern Day Slavery Act</a> in the UK does not provide for civil remedies for those who have been abused, she said it could be possible under international law.</p> <p>In the US, cases against Nestl\u00e9 and Costco have failed. But an ongoing <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2016/aug/18/cambodian-villagers-sue-us-thai-firms-human-trafficking-forced-labour-claims-walmart-shrimp\">lawsuit</a> brought on behalf of Cambodian fishermen recruited to work in the Thai seafood industry and filed against four companies, including alleged suppliers to Walmart, could set a successful precedent. \u201cThere is a momentum towards litigation because as human rights lawyers we are looking at the abused and ways to have their voices heard that say stop this,\u201d said Chandran.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>One of the main obstacles at present is the defenselessness of workers in the seafood sector, particularly those working on boats. \u201cThis is an incredibly vulnerable community of victims ... out at sea, remote. Unless there is a system that enables victims to feel safe and encouraged to come forward and give evidence there is going to be a big gap in bringing companies to account,\u201d said Chandran.</p> <h2>Response from industry</h2> <p>While much of the focus has been on Thailand as a major supplier of seafood to Europe and the US, Trent pointed out that you could also find human rights abuses on an individual scale in the UK, France or Spain. In response, Seafish has added human rights clauses to its certification scheme for fishermen. Backed by third-party checks, the updated <a href=\"http://www.seafish.org/rfs/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Responsible Fishing Scheme (RFS)</a> aims to give fishermen and boat operators a chance to prove they are not exploiting or endangering crews, as well as adhering to sustainable catching methods, Woodhatch said.</p> <p>A number of UK retailers, including Marks &amp; Spencer, have made commitments to ensure all their suppliers are RFS certified. However, a former fishing industry auditor in the audience criticised the scheme for interviewing only the captain as part of the auditing process, rather than speaking to ordinary crew members. Trent agreed, \u201cIt makes no sense. They are the fishermen catching the fish. They are completely outside all these schemes\u201d. Woodhatch said they wanted to incorporate crew interviews into future revisions of the scheme.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/video/2014/jun/10/slavery-thai-fishing-industry-worker-suicides-video-animation\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/3qvq2\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2106785\"            data-video-name=\"Slavery in the Thai fishing industry: how workers are being driven to suicide \u2013 video animation\"            data-video-provider=\"guardian.co.uk\"            data-video-poster=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2014/6/9/1402326079810/Thai-Prawns-Animation-2-010.jpg\"> <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-438955963\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2014/6/9/1402326079810/Thai-Prawns-Animation-2-010.jpg\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2014/06/11/140609ThaiAnimation2-16x9.mp4\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2014/06/11/140609ThaiAnimation2.webm\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2014/06/11/140609ThaiAnimation2/140609ThaiAnimation2.m3u8\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2014/06/11/140609ThaiAnimation2_3gpSml16x9.3gp\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2014/06/11/140609ThaiAnimation2_3gpLg16x9.3gp\"> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/video/2014/jun/10/slavery-thai-fishing-industry-worker-suicides-video-animation\">Slavery in the Thai fishing industry: how workers are being driven to suicide</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>Chandran also pointed out that as the scheme was voluntary and did not yet cover non-UK boats, its impact on the wider global problem of human rights abuse in the seafood sector was limited. To get that global impact in Asia, Africa and Europe, individual companies need to be accountable under UK laws, she said. \u201cIf a British company is able to establish itself in an industry where there is an absence of rights for workers, then it\u2019s a necessity to ensure there is protection for the workers.\u201d</p> <p>McBain and Woodhatch agreed that this is a difficult task for seafood companies, especially when they source fish on a daily basis from multiple boats. Chandran said the most obvious solution is to work with competitors to check on suppliers or shorten the supply chain. Trent concurred: \u201cThe more companies only source from people they have reasonable degrees of surety [about] the more it squeezes out the dark side. You can\u2019t switch to a situation where you have no slavery or abuse tomorrow, but you can push very hard.\u201d </p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet element--supporting\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/helenmctaggart/status/776379093176705024\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"> <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">At <a href=\"https://twitter.com/GuardianSustBiz\" rel=\"nofollow\">@GuardianSustBiz</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/slaveryevent?src=hash\" rel=\"nofollow\">#slaveryevent</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ejfoundation\" rel=\"nofollow\">@ejfoundation</a> calls on biz to show l'ship in slavery + fish.

This was to stop workers being indebted to brokers (bonded labour) \u2013 but it does not apply to workers on fishing boats. </p> <p>Beyond companies changing their policies, Chandran and Trent said there needed to be laws to protect worker rights and allow them to unionise. Both of these steps would undoubtedly come at the cost of cheap seafood.</p> <p>McBain pointed out that at least one retailer promises to bring prices down every year. \u201cIf prices are going down each year, where is the money for the workers and the living wage at every point along that supply chain?\u201d The answer, said Woodhatch, was that retailers had to take the decision out of consumers\u2019 hands and ensure they don\u2019t sell seafood produced using slave labour. \u201cThe consumer is hit with so much information about what they should and shouldn\u2019t eat. When they go into the supermarket they are just trying to decide what to eat for dinner.

  "<p>The French train company Alstom is to build a new multimillion-pound plant in the north-west of England, delivering a major boost to the region during a time of uncertainty about Britain\u2019s exit from the European Union.</p> <p>Alstom will spend an initial \u00a320m on a new site at Widnes, Cheshire, creating about 600 jobs. The facility will modernise the Pendolino trains on the west coast mainline and contain a training academy, but it could eventually manufacture new rolling stock if Alstom wins a contract to produce trains for London Underground or HS2.</p> <p>The Paris-based company is making the investment in Britain despite concerns about the cost of importing and exporting products after the country leaves the EU and doubts about the future of the HS2 rail project. Carlos Ghosn, the chief executive of Nissan, warned last week that Brexit <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/sep/30/nissan-hard-brexit-compensation-new-uk-investment-tariffs\">threatens Britain\u2019s vehicle manufacturing industry</a> and he would look for compensation from the government before committing to new investments.</p> <p>However, Nick Crossfield, the managing director of Alstom for UK and Ireland, said the French company is \u201cfundamentally committed\u201d to the UK market. He also described HS2 as an \u201cincredibly important and transformational investment\u201d for the UK. </p> <p>Crossfield said the investment in Widnes represented a \u201cstep change\u201d for Alstom\u2019s approach to the UK. </p> <p>It also highlights the revival in Britain\u2019s train manufacturing industry. A decade ago Britain was left with only one train manufacturer \u2013 Bombardier in Derby \u2013 after a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2003/jun/21/2\">string of closures</a>. However, Hitachi, the Japanese conglomerate, <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/sep/03/hitachi-factory-george-osborne-northern-powerhouse\">opened a plant in County Durham last year</a> and Alstom\u2019s announcement is another boost.</p> <p>\u201cIt is a step change in terms of the type and nature of investment that we have made in the UK,\u201d Crossfield said. \u201c It is a fundamental step in a direction that sees us delivering a much broader capability in the UK market. The UK market is one of the most high profile and important for Alstom worldwide.\u201d</p> <p>The 30-acre site is due to open next year. The facility will grow \u201caccording to the opportunities that we win\u201d, Crossfield added, and is a \u201cfoothold that provides us with a base to expand even further\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"11e4f2ab9c5d481c69cd3406cecb4eb3bea62900\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/11e4f2ab9c5d481c69cd3406cecb4eb3bea62900/589_97_2810_1687/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Theresa May\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Theresa May used her speech at the Conservative party conference to reiterate her plan to \u2018press ahead\u2019 with HS2.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Toby Melville/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The Alstom boss said the company had not reconsidered the project despite Britain\u2019s vote to leave the European Union:\u201cOne of the major issues with UK rail right now is capacity, and that is underpinning all of the investment that is going in. </p> <p>\u201cWhile the EU question is important for the country as a whole, people still need to get on trains to get from A to B and we see no reason why that investment will change.</p> <p>\u201cWe are fundamentally committed to the UK market. Its strategic importance, its size and its dynamics were not impacted by [Brexit],\u201d he added.</p> <p>\u201cOther than some of the very limited foreign exchange volatility, we have not seen any major impact to our business. For us, it is business as usual. We are in a business that is based on long-term fundamentals like population growth and industrial development and that continues as before.\u201d</p> <p>Alstom has confirmed it will bid to build the trains for HS2 and unveiled plans for double-decker carriages. It is also bidding for the New Tube for London contract, which is worth up to \u00a32.5bn and involves designing and building 250 next-generation trains for the Piccadilly, Bakerloo, Central and Waterloo &amp; City lines in London.</p> <p>Crossfield said that even if the government scrapped HS2, which is estimated to cost more than \u00a340bn, it \u201cwould not change the investment perspective for us here in the UK because there is a very significant and healthy domestic rolling stock market\u201d.</p> <p>Nonetheless, Crossfield said HS2 is a \u201cvery significant opportunity\u201d for Alstom, with the company eyeing up the contracts to build rolling stock and infrastructure for the network. He said it was \u201ctoo early to say\u201d whether the trains would be built in the UK if Alstom won the contract, but some work is likely to be conducted in Widnes. The company employs 32,000 people around the world, including 3,200 at 12 UK sites.</p> <p>Theresa May confirmed at the Conservative party conference that the government will \u201cpress ahead\u201d with HS2, and Alstom has welcomed the government\u2019s comments.</p> <p>\u201cIt is a very crucial and important infrastructure project that should go ahead,\u201d Crossfield said. \u201cI was at the Conservative party conference over the last couple of days speaking at a couple of fringe events and the government remains committed to HS2 in a very vital way. I think it is an incredibly important and transformational investment for the country.</p> <p>\u201cThere were very specific comments made in the last 48 hours of the conference in regard to continued support for HS2 and when you look and talk to the people involved in that project within government it is clear there is significant momentum. There is no dilution in commitment to that project at all.\u201d<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Alstom <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2010/mar/24/alstom-directors-bribery-dawn-raids\">remains under investigation by the Serious Fraud Office</a> over corruption allegations regarding overseas contracts.

She later adjourned the application to 12 October after police asked for more time to check prospective bail addresses.</p> <p>Kelly argued the officer should remain in custody because there was a risk he would interfere with witnesses, the \u201cstrength of evidence\u201d in relation to at least one of the charges and the fact they carried \u201cextensive periods of imprisonment\u201d.</p> <p>Jones said the crown\u2019s \u201cstrongest account\u201d against the officer rested on \u201clargely untested technology\u201d. Its nature was not revealed in court.</p> <p>\u201cThat technology \u2013 and I\u2019ve asked my learned friend [the prosecutor] and I\u2019ve also asked the officers \u2013 I\u2019ve never seen it in a trial before,\u201d Jones said. \u201cSo no one knows how it is going to be used, what directions the district court judge should be giving in relation to them.</p> <p>\u201cAnd no one knows whether another expert might come along and easily poke holes in this untested expert evidence that the crown relies heavily on.\u201d</p> <p>Jones said police \u201ckeep going on about the risk of reoffending but it needs to be seen as this pocket of a relationship that [the accused] was in that has ended\u201d. \u201cThere\u2019s no allegation before that and none since it,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Jones said \u201ca number of years have passed\u201d since the alleged offending. \u201cThat amount of time has passed without one single incident of [the accused] trying to intimidate or interfere in such a way to keep these complaints unearthed,\u201d Jones said.</p> <p>He said \u201cwithout revealing the defence\u2019s hand, there are real issues in relation to the motives in relation to these allegations\u201d.</p> <p>As a result of the allegations and the involvement of the department of child safety, he said, his client \u201cfaced breaking point at one point in time\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cHe did take sleeping tablets, he went to hospital, but he was released by the mental health professionals,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Hall said the officer faced \u201cserious allegations\u201d. \u201cHowever he does not present as a person who is an unacceptable risk of failing to appear or of harm to himself,\u201d she said.</p> <p>\u201cThere is a risk always of offending on bail which may be addressed by some conditions.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>With Holiday Inn, a wan jukebox musical centered on the songs of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2014/jan/27/irving-berlin-the-five-best-clips\">Irving Berlin</a>, the Roundabout Theater Company has entered hostel territory. A loose adaptation of <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0034862/\">the 1942 Bing Crosby and Fred Astaire film</a>, its plot concerns Jim (Bryce Pinkham), a nightclub song-and-dance man who dreams of forsaking the bright lights of Flatbush for the dimmer bulbs of rural Connecticut. <br></p> <p>After his callous fiancee, Lila (Megan Sikora), leaves him to go on the road with his dashing partner, Ted (Corbin Bleu), Jim makes a half-hearted attempt at farming, then turns his home into a show palace with the help of a shy schoolteacher, Linda (Lora Lee Gayer), and a brassy handywoman, Louise (Megan Lawrence), replacing the mammy of the film. The catch: the guesthouse is only open on holidays when Jim\u2019s former colleagues are at liberty. Apparently chorus girls and boys never work on New Year\u2019s Eve or the Fourth of July. Who knew?</p> <p> The book, by Gordon Greenberg and Chad Hodge, has modernized the tale somewhat (the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jan/08/boglarka-balogh-blackface-offensive\">blackface</a> routine is no more), but not too much. (Surely in this day and age it would be Jim and Ted who band together to open that B&amp;B. And they might have decorated it more handsomely.) The story has an old-timey predictability that may delight those with more conservative tastes, but no real effort has been made to differentiate this show from the other recent Berlin offering, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2014/nov/13/white-christmas-review---syrupy-sweet-and-overlong\">White Christmas</a>, or to integrate the songs into the show. \u201cWhat could be better than Broadway?\u201d a hoofer asks. Then Jim launches into Blue Skies. You can check out anytime you like, and chances are that one will \u2013 and quite often \u2013 as the leaden dialogue trudges to its close. </p> <p> Still, the Berlin tunes \u2013 White Christmas, Easter Parade, Cheek to Cheek \u2013 are of course a treat, with zippy orchestrations courtesy of Larry Blank and zestful playing by the orchestra, with Andy Einhorn conducting. Several of the production numbers are lackluster, but the choreographer Denis Jones contributes two show-stoppers, a jubilant Shaking the Blues Away, in which the chorus skip rope with Christmas garlands, and a percussive tap routine for Song of Freedom.</p> <p> The acting is variable, in part because the book is so thin. Greenberg\u2019s direction doesn\u2019t veer from the expected. Pinkham, Gayer and Lawrence are given enough lines to create recognizable characters, but Bleu doesn\u2019t seem to have been given any character and Sikora has little to do except vamp and shimmy. It\u2019s too much to expect a musical to provide maid service or a mint on every seat, but if a new musical ever needed fresh linens, it\u2019s this one. </p>",

Vote-by-mail requests among Hispanics in Florida, for example, were up 77% since this juncture four years ago, Mook said. </p> <p>The trend of more vote-by-mail requests extended to other demographics who have increasingly voted Democrat and might feel alienated by Trump, such as Asian Americans.

While Clinton\u2019s campaign acknowledged Democrats were unlikely to overtake their opponents overall in early voting this cycle, they were optimistic about closing the gap.</p> <p>Mook also said the campaign was requesting that officials in Florida extend its Oct. 11 voter registration deadline in light of Hurricane Matthew. The Category 4 deadly storm, which is making its up up the Florida coast, prompted its governor to declare a state of emergency. </p> <p>Mook additionally previewed the next presidential debate, slated for Sunday evening in St. Louis, Missouri.

The state of emergency declared by Governor Pat McCrory ahead of the expected arrival of Hurricane Matthew this weekend follows similar civil measures in September when the police killing of a black man set off a wave of angry protests on the streets of the state\u2019s largest city, Charlotte.</p> <p>Few of the tempests to sweep by in 2016 have defined the national mood quite as much, though, as the political maelstrom battering this state. A vital battleground in the presidential election, North Carolina could determine whether <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump\">Donald Trump</a> manages to assemble enough angry white voters to make it all the way to the White House. A \u201cbathroom ban\u201d preventing transgender students from using toilets not matching the gender on their birth certificates has reopened the wounds of America\u2019s culture wars, leading to a boycott by college sport authorities and protests from leading employers such as Apple, American Airlines and Bank of America.</p> <p>But the conservative wave that allowed Republicans to take control of all layers of local government in the state is now threatening to drown the party itself. The fervour stoked by battles over gay rights, voter registration laws, and immigration is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/29/donald-trump-nascar-north-carolina-republicans\">putting off many moderates</a> and could yet see Democrats win presidential, Senate and gubernatorial races here in November.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/06/battleground-states-north-carolina-trump-clinton-sharp-divisions\">Battleground states: North Carolina's sharp divides put election on knife-edge</a> </p> </aside>  <p>What has made such controversies so shocking to many outsiders is that the Tar Heel state had long since stopped conforming to any easy stereotypes of a politically conservative southern backwater. The recent protests against the killing of Keith Lamont Scott in Charlotte took place among gleaming downtown high-rises of the New South \u2013 race riots shattering the calm of what otherwise appears a diverse and progressive boomtown at the heart of one of America\u2019s major transport and financial hubs.</p> <p>Pride in North Carolina\u2019s modern and open economy is still visible, despite the high-profile battles over sexual and racial equality.

He casts his guests in a burlesque he scripts for them, and cattle-prods them into playing their parts, first fawning over them until they feel like celebrities, then bringing down the hammer of humiliation. He\u2019s a diabolically domineering scene partner. No interviewer has ever been as adroit with treacherous leading questions in the vein of \u201cWhen did you stop beating your wife?\u201d Stern, in other words, gets people to publicly embrace their worst selves\u2014and say things they live to regret.</p> <p>That\u2019s exactly what happened with Trump. Today, as the Republican nominee, he may fashion himself as a boss and a master of the universe. But what comes across in old tapes of the show, resurfaced recently by BuzzFeed and other outlets, is that Trump, like many of Stern\u2019s guests, was often the one being played. By nailing him as a buffoon and then\u2014unkindest cut\u2014forcing him to kiss the Howard Stern ring, Stern and his co-anchor, Robin Quivers, created a series of broadcasts that today showcase not just Trump\u2019s misogyny but his ready submission to sharper minds.</p> </blockquote> <p>Read the <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/10/howard-stern-donald-trump-2016-214322#ixzz4MK5DCjOP\">full piece here</a>.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57f674cae4b03b0685c083de\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-06T16:06:40.025Z\">5.06pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Paul Ryan to campaign with Donald Trump</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>So much for every Republican running away from Trump.

  "<p>Blackouts, when I was a kid, were fun. The emergency candles would be collected from under the sink, Mum would crack open a packet of cards, or the Trivial Pursuit box, and in the newly low-lit illumination of our surroundings, we\u2019d eat squares of chocolate and indulge low-tech amusements as if stolen into an unexpected, folksy holiday. </p> <p>But to imagine a whole state blacked out, from horizon to horizon, erases the folksy glow from the childhood blackouts of my mind. In these hard-wired times, there\u2019s a doom aesthetic that accompanies ideas of total darkness. This may be why last week\u2019s state-wide blackout of South Australia \u2013 amid a terrible storm \u2013 has had such a heightened, emotional impact on the national imagination.</p> <p>For South Australians, the shadows of the event were double: there was not only material darkness, but re-immersion into that state\u2019s angry history of energy politics. The rapid and false claims by Barnarby Joyce and Nick Xenophon, among others, that <a href=\"https://viewer.gutools.co.uk/australia-news/2016/sep/29/south-australia-blackout-explained-renewables-not-to-blame\">the state\u2019s high renewable energy targets were to blame </a>are but the latest manifestation of ideological energy wars waged on South Australians. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/oct/05/wicked-windfarms-and-how-to-separate-the-facts-of-the-blackout-from-the-storm-of-spin\">'Wicked' windfarms and how to separate the facts of the blackout from the storm of spin | Katharine Murphy</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Hostilities began<strong> </strong>in the 1990s, with the privatisation of the state electricity commission, ETSA. The state\u2019s power network that blacked out last week is not a public asset, but owned and operated by <a href=\"http://www.adelaidenow.com.au/news/south-australia/sa-power-networks-owned-by-billionaire-li-kashing-makes-four-times-more-profit-out-of-us-than-its-uk-group/story-fni6uo1m-1226943633683\">Hong Kong based private company Cheung Kong Infrastructure Holdings</a>, calling itself SA Power Networks.</p> <p>Evidence has not emerged that any<strong> </strong>lack of network maintenance caused the towers to blow over or the lights to go out, and South Australia was certainly lucky to escape catastrophe. But given that the royal commission into Victoria\u2019s Black Saturday fire disaster in Victoria did attribute <a href=\"http://www.utilitymagazine.com.au/union-warns-privatisation-undermines-fire-safety/\">blame for five of the most lethal fires to eroded maintenance standards</a> in the wake of cost-cutting privatisation \u201cefficiencies\u201d, questions about the wisdom of selling off essential services like electricity \u2013 in South Australia or anywhere else \u2013 are timely and valid.</p> <p>Because not only are there are proven cases of safety standards being eroded through electricity<strong> </strong>privatisation, we also know that Australians typically reject privatisation.</p> <p>The privatisation of ETSA in South Australia was a brutal political battle and it<strong> </strong>followed an established privatisation narrative. Three out of four South Australians were opposed to the sell-off of the state asset when first mooted by then-Liberal premier John Olsen in the late 1990s, as a means of recouping funds lost to the obliged bail-out of the failed State Bank.</p> <p>Olsen even went to the 1997 election promising that state power would not be sold. With the convenient post-election discovery of some kind of budgetary black hole \u2013 stop me if you\u2019ve heard this one before \u2013 in 1999, Olsen convinced two Labor members of parliament, Terry<strong> </strong>Cameron and Trevor Crothers, to rat out their own party and back him in. While Labor in South Australia had taken a stand against privatisation that, in the era of economic rationalism, had not always been taken elsewhere, it was with the support of Cameron and Crothers that the asset was sold.</p> <p>Privatisation is often spruiked to populations as a mean of deriving greater efficiencies from services, leading to lowered prices. Not only is there no evidence to suggest that privatisation has consistent or meaningful effects on lowered prices, but economist John Quiggin has identified that the ETSA sale has cost South Australians between $1bn and $2bn in lost revenue, as well as their<strong> </strong>control of an monopoly essential asset. </p> <p>The ideological right similarly like to insist that a transition to renewable energy will drive up consumer costs \u2013 and, again, blamed the technology itself for the surge in South Australian electricity prices in July. But it was the privatised SA Power Networks who\u2019d markedly increased power prices. The company exploited Australia\u2019s flattery of private monopolies to squeeze <a href=\"http://www.adelaidenow.com.au/news/south-australia/sa-power-networks-owned-by-billionaire-li-kashing-makes-four-times-more-profit-out-of-us-than-its-uk-group/story-fni6uo1m-1226943633683\">four and a half times more profit out of each customer in South Australia</a> than it can manage from its sister operation in the UK. And not a single apologist for privatisation backed down when a report found that the July price surge was in part down to <a href=\"https://viewer.gutools.co.uk/australia-news/2016/aug/11/electricity-price-spikes-caused-by-energy-companies-gaming-the-system-report-finds\">energy companies \u201cgaming\u201d the system</a>.</p> <p><a href=\"http://meteopolitique.com/fiches/eau/privatisation/Analyse/2005/a08.pdf\">Australians are hardly alone among populations</a> who see the transference of assets under their own democratic control to private corporate interests as unfair. </p> <p>Why Liberals and other modern conservatives insist on privatisation is a matter of a small-state ideology broadly articulated by neoliberal political economist, Friedrich Von Hayek. Von Hayek\u2019s thesis is that the state\u2019s responsibility is to create opportunities for private competition rather than run systems of social service itself.</p> <p>In Australia, t<a href=\"https://newmatilda.com/2016/09/29/power-games-the-real-reason-south-australia-lost-electricity-supply/\">he structure of the electricity grid </a>and power distribution means ownership of power can only be a monopoly, whether privatised or not. But so doctrinaire is the insistence on neoliberal \u201ccompetition\u201d that the function of the Australian Energy Regulator is to effectively pretend that there is a competitive market, and instruct the monopoly-owners to price accordingly.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/06/a-storm-is-brewing-with-the-states-and-its-entirely-of-turnbulls-making\">A storm is brewing with the states. And it\u2019s entirely of Turnbull\u2019s making | Kristina Keneally</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It says something that the head of the ACCC \u2013 a longtime advocate of privatisation \u2013 <a href=\"https://viewer.gutools.co.uk/australia-news/2016/jul/27/acccs-rod-sims-says-privatisations-severely-damaging-economy\">has come out against electricity privatisations</a> as dangerous to the local economy. But under the Liberals, Australia is a country repeatedly exposed to ideological nonsense at the expense of material reality. The false attribution of blame to renewable energy for the blackouts is not only a case in point, but provokes an important question. </p> <p>This is the climate change era, where extreme weather activity has wiped out the power supply of an entire state, set other states on fire, saturated yet others with floods - so shouldn\u2019t essential services like electricity something be subject to democratic control? Do we really think that our best interests as a community be served by handing infrastructure over to a false economy of profiteering private interest? </p> <p>The Western Australian treasurer, Liberal Mike Nahan, <a href=\"http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-07-17/western-power-a-divided-government-will-struggle-to-sell/7634290\">is eyeing electricity privatisation</a> with the pretext of his own state\u2019s  record debt and deficit. In Queensland, the LNP\u2019s Tim Nicholls is making noise about privatising power if he wins the next state election. One has to wonder if the willingness of the Liberals, Nationals and their ilk to shout at the impossible boogeyman of wicked wind energy is an urge, conscious or instinctive, to distract us from listening to a clearer message \u2013 that an ideological priority of privatising electricity leaves communities vulnerable. There are, I fear, dark times ahead. </p> <ul> <li>This article was amended on 8 October 2016 to remove a reference to Nick Xenophon voting in favour of the South Australian electricity privatisation.
