However, by the second half, the US adjusted and the gap in talent proved to be too much. This US team had a second gear when things became dicey, Japan did not. This game was not the cakewalk that the 110-64 final score would suggest it was, but by the end the US team clearly showed why they\u2019re the heavy favorites.</p> <p>And that will do it for our live coverage of USA women\u2019s basketball, but the Guardian will continue to have literal around-the-clock coverage of the Olympics until the closing ceremonies.

Obviously, this statement will end up looking foolish should they somehow fail to win the gold but, unlike <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/12/olympic-basketball-usa-serbia-report\">their peers</a> on the men\u2019s team, they have yet to show any signs of vulnerability.<br></p> <p>While both teams are currently undefeated heading into the knockout rounds, the men\u2019s team has played three straight closer-than-expected games, while the women\u2019s team has been completely demolishing their competition. Their point differential during the preliminaries has been a ridiculous +204 while the men\u2019s team has put up a comparatively underwhelming +117 after winning their games against Serbia and France by only three points.<br></p> <p>So, it\u2019s not entirely certain that there\u2019s a team out there that could possibly knock the US women out of this tournament. It\u2019s definitely difficult to imagine this Japanese team pulling off the shocking upset. Japan has only familiar to US fans, Ramu Tokashiki, who plays for the Seattle Storm, where she received an All-Rookie nod in her debut season. Japan went 3-2 during the preliminary stage, squeaking into the quarterfinals as the fourth seed in Group A. (Oh, and for comparison their point differential so far in the Olympics has been +8).</p> <p>So it\u2019s a bit of an understatement to say that the US are the favorites in this matchup, but, well, there\u2019s a reason they play the games. That\u2019s the beauty of these Olympics: there\u2019s a 80% chance we\u2019ll witness a dominant performance, a 19% chance we\u2019ll have an entertaining game and a 1% chance of one of the most surprising upsets of the year. In any event, it should be fun.<br></p> <p>And, as always, we encourage your feedback.

  "<p>Archaeologists believe they have identified a new way of putting accurate dates to great events of prehistory. Rare and spectacular storms on the sun appear to have left their mark in forests and fields around the planet over the past 5,000 years.</p> <p>Michael Dee, of Oxford University\u2019s research laboratory for archaeology and the history of art, thinks evidence of such solar storms could help put precise years to some of the great uncertainties of history: the construction of Egypt\u2019s Great Pyramid of Giza, the collapse of the ancient Mayan civilisation in Central America, and perhaps even the arrival of the Vikings in the Americas.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2016/aug/16/lost-cities-6-angkor-wat-nasa-technology-khmer-megacity\">Lost cities #7: how Nasa technology uncovered the 'megacity' of Angkor</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Every tree maintains its own almanac in the form of annual growth rings. For decades dendrochronologists have been using tree-ring evidence and radiocarbon dating to build a timetable of events that confirm historical accounts, even those predating the first written chronicles. <br></p> <p>Carbon dating works by comparing the ratio between two isotopes of the element carbon, C-14 and C-12, present in old samples of organic material. Because of constant bombardment by cosmic rays, ratios of C-14 in the upper atmosphere are more or less constant, and since radioisotopes decay with time, at a predictable rate, the ratio of C-14 to the stable form C-12 is a guide to the age of any timber in a cathedral roof or a stone age burial site, for example.</p> <p>The technique is imprecise, with an error range of 50-100 years, and also expensive. However, the discovery of unusually high levels of C-14 \u2013 up to 20 times the normal level \u2013 laid down in during especially violent solar storms may enable scientists to date material much more accurately. Every tree growing at the time of such a sun storm, anywhere in the world, would have preserved a record of it.</p> <p>In 2012, the Japanese scientist Fusa Miyake identified a dramatically raised level of C-14 in one set of growth rings that is known to date from 775AD. Since then, what the Oxford team call a second Miyake event \u2013 a consequence of a catastrophic extraterrestrial discharge of energy \u2013 has been identified from the year 994AD. </p> <p>Dee and his co-author Benjamin Pope propose a new science, astrochronology, to harness this solar storm evidence, in an article in the journal <a href=\"http://rspa.royalsocietypublishing.org/lookup/doi/10.1098/rspa.2016.0263\">Proceedings of the Royal Society A</a> . The technique could very precisely tie so-called \u201cfloating chronologies\u201d of ancient Egypt , Mayan civilisation or the bronze age to fixed dates in the universal calendar. The Mayan day numbering system spans a thousand years and is well established \u2013 but researchers have so far been unable to tie any event in that to any date in the Gregorian calendar of Europe.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2016/aug/06/maya-snake-dynasty-tomb-belize-ruins\">Maya tomb uncovered holding body, treasure and tales of 'snake dynasty'</a> </p> </aside>  <p> \u201cIn fact, the earliest truly fixable date in the Americas is still taken to be the arrival of Columbus in 1492,\u201d the authors write.</p> <p>Where checks have been made on tree rings, these have been on a decadal basis \u2013 which is why no-one noticed the rare single-year anomalies of the past. Such celestial violence may also have been witnessed: the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle records an eerie \u201cred crucifix\u201d in the sky in 774AD. Another spectacular solar storm in 1859 led to aurorae visible in Hawaii and the Caribbean. </p> <p>The scientists propose cutting-edge mathematical techniques to re-examine all the existing data and identify hints of more possible solar storm spikes. </p> <p>\u201cWhat we have is a decadal record going back more than 10,000 years,\u201d Dee said. \u201cThere must be more of these events and we will try and find where we should look for them. You can\u2019t just measure every single tree ring because it would cost tens of millions of pounds, because each tree ring has to be measured in triplicate essentially and there are a lot of years between now and 5,000 BC.\u201d</p> <p>If the researchers do identify another spike, they expect it to be duplicated in surviving plant tissue everywhere in the world from that year: in the reeds that became papyrus, in the flax that was preserved as linen, in the timbers that shore up ancient graves. Spikes in tree rings from 775AD have been found in Germany, Russia, the US and New Zealand. The astrochronologists have a potential record far more accurate than a human scribe.<br></p> <p>\u201cThe key here is that we have long connected chronologies. In the Old Kingdom of Egypt, we have all the sequence of kings, and the order of kings is pretty well established. We have a reasonable handle on how long they were in power,\u201d Dee said. </p> <p>\u201cIf we found two or three spikes in the third millennium BC not only would we be able to pin down the Old Kingdom\u2019s 400-500 year sequence, we\u2019d be able to check that the years between the kingdoms add up; there\u2019s no missing years, because the tree ring record is absolutely established.\u201d </p>",

Having described both Joe Hart and Yaya Tour\u00e9 as \u201camazing\u201d, Guardiola left City\u2019s No1 on the bench for the opening game of the season, and has left the Ivorian at home for tonight\u2019s crucial Champions League play-off first leg against Steaua Bucharest. Two games in, and another ominous signal for one of City\u2019s former stalwarts; Guardiola may stick to the boardroom script in front of media but he has quickly shown that things will be done his way on the pitch.</p> <p><strong>Also hidden between the lines are Guardiola\u2019s full-backs, </strong>at least when City have the ball: somewhere higher than the defensive midfielder, lower than the attacking midfielders and inside their wingers, the strategy was deployed by Pep in Munich to dominate the midfield. Philipp Lahm and David Alaba took to it comfortably but the problem, certainly against Sunderland on Saturday, was that Ga\u00ebl Clichy and Bacary Sagna took to the centre of the pitch with the wide-eyed bewilderment of this chap:</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Y2uQn_wvc\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/e6Y2uQn_wvc?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p><strong>It\u2019s these teething problems that Steaua will hope to exploit</strong>. Their former midfielder Laurentiu Reghecampf managed the side to second in the Romanian top flight last season, and his side have began the new domestic campaign with three straight wins.

That is what it takes to make autonomous vehicles a reality for millions of people around the world.\u201d</p> <p>The 113-year-old company said the new cars, which will be designed at its research facility in Palo Alto, California, were being \u201cspecifically designed for commercial mobility services, such as ride-sharing and ride-hailing, and will be available in high volumes\u201d. The company did not state if it planned to go into partnership with Uber or Lyft, as other carmakers have, but said it was exploring all options. </p> <p>It expects to have 30 test self-driving Fusion Hybrid cars on the road in California, Arizona and Michigan this year, and 90 next year. </p> <p>The company, which opened its Palo Alto research facility just last year, said it would double the size of its development team to 260 by the end of 2017. </p> <p>\u201cOur goal was to become a member of the community,\u201d Ken Washington, Ford\u2019s head of research and advanced engineering, said. \u201cToday, we are actively working with more than 40 startups, and have developed a strong collaboration with many incubators, allowing us to accelerate development of technologies and services.\u201d</p>",

The owners of grouse moors, who are also exceedingly rich, justify these fees by ensuring that there are vast numbers of birds to shoot. This requires, across great tracts of our uplands, the elimination of almost everything else.</p> <p>Grouse are wild birds, but cosseted at the expense of other life forms. Predators and competitors must be eliminated, either legally or, in the case of protected species such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/jun/16/birdwatch-peregrine-falcon\">peregrine falcons</a>, golden eagles, red kites and hen harriers, illegally.

But to hell with the plebs.</p> <p>To rub our noses in it properly, we pay them for the privilege: grouse moors are subsidised by us. At the height of his austerity programme, as essential public services were cut to the bone, David Cameron\u2019s government <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/apr/28/britain-plutocrats-landed-gentry-shotgun-owners\">raised the subsidy for grouse moors by 84%, to \u00a356 per hectare</a>. Some owners now harvest hundreds of thousands of pounds of our money every year.</p> <p>Cameron also tried to close the <a href=\"http://www.nwcu.police.uk/\">national wildlife crime unit</a>, which would have pleased his friends no end. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/mar/01/uks-national-wildlife-unit-wins-late-reprieve-from-closure\">It was saved only by a public outcry. </a>Conservationists have called for a law of vicarious liability, making the owners of grouse moors responsible for the wildlife crime they commission, rather than leaving only the gamekeepers to take the rap. But this proposal was <a href=\"https://raptorpersecutionscotland.wordpress.com/2011/08/13/no-vicarious-liability-for-england/\">struck down by Cameron\u2019s environment minister, Richard Benyon</a>. I\u2019m sure it had nothing to do with the fact that he owns a grouse moor.</p> <p>But through the efforts of wildlife campaigners (like Packham and the RSPB) and people whose homes have been flooded downstream, the grouse industry is now being called to account. Last week, the petition posted by the conservationist Mark Avery <a href=\"https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/125003\">calling for an end to driven grouse shooting \u2013 where wild birds are sent towards the guns by \u201cbeaters\u201d \u2013 passed the 100,000-signature threshold</a>: the issue is now likely to be debated in parliament.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Through the efforts of wildlife campaigners like Chris Packham, the grouse industry is now being called to account</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The result is You Forgot the Birds, championed by the Daily Mail, which describes it as<a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3094619/I-ll-sue-RSPB-libel-charity-s-incompetence-misleading-ads-says-former-cricketer-Sir-Ian-Botham.html\"> \u201ca grassroots campaign by farmers and conservationists\u201d</a>.

As for the RSPB and its members, they\u2019re bipedal vermin. Never mind that many of them live and work in the countryside; they are interlopers with no right to a voice in rural life.</p> <p>The media collaborates.

  "<p>As a police officer, I was told that the Taser, the new bit of kit that was bright yellow and shaped like a gun, would protect officers and our communities. That they could literally stop a raging bull, take down even the strongest attacker and keep us safe. When first introduced, we were assured that they were the \u201csoft\u201d option.

In the real world the person may have mental health, drink, drug or other issues. This is the situation we seek to contain using this \u201cless lethal\u201d option.</p> <p>The Taser is supposed to work on two levels, psychological and physical, but if a person has mental health issues the psychological impact of these deadly weapons might be limited. Consider too that there are much higher levels of mental health diagnosis in parts of the black and minority ethnic (BME) community. Statistics show us as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/oct/13/black-people-three-times-more-likely-to-have-taser-used-against-them\" title=\"\">three times more likely</a> to be on the receiving end of a Taser.</p> <p>Eighteen months ago <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/jan/30/frontline-police-tasers-terror-threat-federation-leader\" title=\"\">we heard calls</a> for every officer in England and Wales to be given the option of being armed with a Taser to meet the increased terror risk. But I am not convinced that the incidents we have seen in France and Belgium recently would have been&#xa0;stopped by officers carrying Tasers. I still believe our best hope is to stick with the core of what we do best here in the UK: policing by consent, with&#xa0;the support of the public and the communities we serve.</p> <p>That must mean all communities. The \u201cPeelian principal\u201d \u2013 named after the founder of modern policing, Sir Robert Peel \u2013 asserts that \u201cthe police are the public and the public are the police\u201d.

This is particularly evident in the area of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2016/feb/11/uk-police-forces-still-abusing-stop-and-search-powers\" title=\"\">stop and search</a>, which has already created a mindset of unfairness.

I&#xa0;have seen the dreadful consequences of knife crime in our communities. What I want is for the Taser to be used to&#xa0;reduce the number of tragic incidents, not increase them. Officers are trained to consider the most appropriate option&#xa0;in the circumstances but ultimately it remains the responsibility of officers and those who employ them to justify their use of force. These decisions are underpinned by legislation, but the law can only ever be a starting point. We must train officers to understand behaviour, to consider all&#xa0;the options, and, in critical situations, to be able to give the vital aftercare that&#xa0;is needed.</p> <p>As president of the National Black Police Association, I am clearly concerned about the disproportionate use and the impact that Taser use has on our communities. Increasing their use may seem an easy option, but we must always be aware of the concern Tasers are causing in communities already filled with mistrust and fear towards police. The reality is that we are dealing with fragile, vulnerable human beings, and there needs to be more thought before we reach a stage where more officers carry them. When things go wrong, we must be transparent.</p> <p>It is difficult at this stage to understand <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/16/dalian-atkinson-taser-death-police-institutional-racism\" title=\"\">the incident in West Mercia involving Dalian Atkinson</a>, who died after a Taser was discharged, but it is vital that thorough investigation is carried out so his family and those closest to him are left in no doubt as to what happened.

But this year it seems an unlikely 43rd spectator sport has snuck its way on to the roster: marriage proposals.</p> <p>In the first 10 days of this year\u2019s Rio Games, three athletes have found their partners getting down on bended knee \u2013 or in one case holding up the crucial question on a sign \u2013 in front of a live audience of thousands and with the news cameras of the world capturing the moment. </p> <p>The competitors themselves have also got in on the act. Moments after winning a silver medal in triple jump, the American Will Claye bounded into the stands, dropped to a knee and proposed to his longtime girlfriend, hurdler Queen Harrison. She said yes. <br></p> <p>A fifth athlete, British race walker Tom Bosworth, chose the night after his 20km race to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/16/olympic-marriage-proposals-tom-bosworth-question-boyfriend\">propose to his boyfriend to against the quieter backdrop of Rio\u2019s Copacabana beach</a> and later tweeted a photo of it happening.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/TomBosworth/status/765281022200147968\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">He said YES!!! <a href=\"https://t.co/roXsw7oq8f\">pic.twitter.com/roXsw7oq8f</a></p>&mdash; Tom Bosworth (@TomBosworth) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TomBosworth/status/765281022200147968\">August 15, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>Every proposal has been greeted with a yes, prompting a global outpouring of emotion as people have celebrated the grand romantic gesture, carried out in full glare of the public.</p> <p>However, the timing and public nature of the proposals have also attracted criticism both for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/brain-flapping/2016/aug/16/public-proposals-true-romance-or-unwarranted-coercion-olympic-podium-proposal\">putting vast amounts of pressure on the would-be spouse</a> and for detracting from his or her sporting achievements.</p> <p>The first emotional proposal came early in the Games, when Brazilian women\u2019s rugby sevens player <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/09/brazilian-womens-rugby-player-becomes-first-althete-to-get-marriage-proposal-at-olympics\">Isadora Cerullo was asked for her hand in marriage by her girlfriend, Marjorie Enya</a>, in front of the whole roaring stadium after the Brazil squad had been knocked out of the competition.</p> <p>This was followed by Chinese diver Qin Kai, who <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/15/chinese-diver-proposes-medals-podium-rio-olympic-games-he-zi-qin-kai\">proposed to his teammate and girlfriend, He Zi</a>, during the ceremony where she was being presented with a silver medal for women\u2019s springboard.

The rise of social media, and people sharing every moment on Facebook and Twitter, means people\u2019s inhibitions towards public displays of emotion have increasingly disappeared \u2013 often to the detriment of relationships.</p> <p>\u201cThese days there is both an idealistic and social pressure for grand public proposals,\u201d he said. \u201cThe pressure of having an ideal relationship, which should be celebrated, is very prominent and it is putting pressure on people to put on these grand, idealistic proposals even when it isn\u2019t suited to their relationship and when it isn\u2019t something that has been discussed.\u201d</p> <p>Gurpreet warned against people blindly following the example of Qin and Cerullo with making their own proposals a public spectacle. \u201cIt a very risky path for couples to go down,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cWho are we to judge what does or doesn\u2019t work for a couple and choosing that particular moment in the Olympics is fine if they had discussed it before,\u201d he said. \u201cBut really what is the grand proposal for? Is it going to help to make a better success of a relationship?

  "<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/aug/15/man-dies-taser-shooting-by-police-in-telford-west-mercia\" title=\"\">Dalian Atkinson died</a> after he was reportedly Tasered three times by West Mercia police outside his father\u2019s home in Telford, Shropshire, early on Monday morning. One&#xa0;witness was reported as saying that after being hit Mr Atkinson \u201cjust dropped like a lead balloon\u201d. Deaths of this kind are not common in Britain \u2013 this seems to have been the eleventh in the current decade, compared with at least 48 police-inflicted Taser deaths <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/sf/investigative/2015/11/26/improper-techniques-increased-risks/\" title=\"\">in the United States</a> in 2015 alone. But they can still have some troubling common characteristics, including the use of such weapons against people with mental health problems and against black and Asian people. Mr Atkinson was a black man and reports say that he had been suffering from depression.</p> <p>The most unusual aspect of the killing of Mr Atkinson may nevertheless be that he was famous. As an Aston Villa footballer, Mr&#xa0;Atkinson was <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=joCdRp4CDV4\" title=\"\">one of the early stars</a> of the Premier League in the 1990s. His death duly made many front pages this week. It also thus received more extensive publicity than <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/jun/15/man-dies-shot-with-taser-by-police-llanelli-south-wales\" title=\"\">a case in Llanelli in June</a> when a former soldier suffering post-traumatic stress disorder died after being Tasered, or <a href=\"http://www.dailypost.co.uk/news/north-wales-news/police-tasering-llandudno-man-left-11694989\" title=\"\">a separate case in Llandudno</a> at the end of July in which a man, said to have been armed with a knife, was still in serious condition in hospital a week later after being Tasered by North Wales police and sustaining a head injury. And it attracted much more attention than <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/03/ipcc-overturns-own-decision-jordan-begley-taser-death\" title=\"\">this month\u2019s decision</a> by the Independent Police Complaints Commission to try to reopen its investigation into the fatal use of the weapon on Jordan Begley in Manchester in 2013 following <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jul/06/police-taser-shooting-contributed-to-mans-death-jury-finds\" title=\"\">a highly critical inquest verdict</a>.</p> <p>Tasers work by shooting two tiny electrodes into a suspect, through which a maximum of 50,000 volts are briefly applied, typically causing the loss of voluntary muscle control so that a victim falls to the ground or freezes on the spot. The pain they cause is excruciating but mostly temporary. The attraction of this \u201cless lethal\u201d option to police \u2013 especially to a police force that still prides itself on being generally unarmed \u2013 is obvious and understandable: shooting someone with a Taser does not normally kill them, but it can&#xa0;stop dangerous criminals in their tracks.</p> <p>England, Wales and Scotland have allowed firearms-trained police to use the weapons since 2004. Three years later, guidelines for England and Wales were extended to permit their use in wider circumstances, notably when severe threats of violence exist. At the end of 2008, specially trained officers who are not firearms officers were also authorised to use them. Through recent years, Taser deployment has expanded rapidly, from 3,128 cases in 2009 <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/police-use-of-taser-statistics-england-and-wales-1-january-to-31-december-2015\" title=\"\">to 10,329 last year</a>, although numbers have levelled off since 2013. In England and Wales, most police \u201cred-dot\u201d suspects \u2013 pointing rather than firing the weapons. Tasers have actually been discharged in about one in five recent cases \u2013 in 2015 there were 1,921 discharges, a slight drop from the previous year. But that is still an average of more than five discharges every day. Discharge rates in 2015 were particularly high in Greater Manchester, South Yorkshire and Surrey, but low in London and elsewhere.</p> <p>Home Office guidelines call Tasers \u201can important tactical option to help specially trained officers resolve potentially violent situations safely\u201d. That is hard to dispute, and it is in the public interest for such situations<a href=\"http://www.policeforum.org/assets/guidingprinciples1.pdf\" title=\"\"> to be resolved without killings</a>.</p> <p>Yet Taser use is also now very widespread. In some cases, like Mr Atkinson\u2019s, Taser use also kills. All such cases are rightly <a href=\"https://www.ipcc.gov.uk/sites/default/files/Documents/guidelines_reports/Taser_report_final_2014.pdf\" title=\"\">referred to the IPCC</a>. Nevertheless, as anecdotal evidence and the statistics suggest, police practice differs more than it should. Taser use against children, old people, those with mental health and drug problems, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/nov/05/police-tasers-deaths-the-counted\" title=\"\">as well as ethnic minorities</a>, raises particular concerns. Any death at police hands is a legitimate matter of concern. The home secretary must do more to reassure the public that each use of Tasers is a last resort and proportionate to a real and present danger. Right now, that is simply not the case.</p>",
  "<p>Consider two of the biggest stories in Britain today. Sir Philip Green faces calls to be stripped of his knighthood and remains in parliament\u2019s firing line over the collapse of BHS, which handed hundreds of millions of pounds to Sir Philip\u2019s family even as its pension scheme blackhole grew ever wider. Now that the company has died, around 11,000 of its employees face an uncertain retirement. Bad enough, but <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-36482658\">even worse off are the 130,000 people expecting a pension from the old British Steel</a>, now Tata Steel. Whatever happens to this behemoth, those people stand to lose a quarter of their retirement incomes. And members still working and paying into the scheme will lose an average of 40% of their benefits under the Conservative government\u2019s proposals, according to figures calculated for the BBC. The devastation that will inflict on thousands of blameless families, from Tyneside to Port Talbot, is unimaginable.</p> <p>Two exceptional hard-luck stories? If only. They are more likely to be a glimpse of the future that lies ahead for many other employees. Analysis published this week shows that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2016/aug/16/top-uk-firms-paid-five-times-more-in-dividends-than-into-pensions\">Britain\u2019s biggest companies paid out five times more in dividends last year than they contributed to their pension schemes</a>. Tesco, BAE Systems and Centrica were among the giant firms that, according to the actuaries at Lane Clark &amp; Peacock, paid more to shareholders than they set aside for retirees. Of the entire FTSE-100 index, 56 companies are running deficits on their defined-benefit pension schemes \u2013 yet the majority of them could have made up that shortfall \u201crelatively easily\u201d, say the analysts. They chose instead to give the money to the fund managers.</p> <p>Put this in context. The British are forever being told that a pensions crisis is looming. Research by the EU published in 2009 showed that <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1202378/Our-elderly-worse-Romanias-British-pensioners-poorest-Europe.html\">British pensioners are worse off than their counterparties in Romania</a>. The former pensions minister, Ros Altmann, has called for a parliamentary inquiry into company schemes. Pension fund managers are warning, not unreasonably, about the impact that the lowest interest rates in 5,000 years will have on the returns they can get for retirees. Yet a big part of the problem is surely that businesses have their priorities skewed.</p> <p>This is one of those bits of research that goes to the heart of what\u2019s wrong with contemporary British capitalism. Consider it a metaphor: faced with a choice between saving for the future of those who have given years and decades in service to their employers, or handing some money to those who may have taken a paper stake for the most fleeting of moments, big British business favours the fast-buck merchants, every time. That doesn\u2019t just explain the underfunding of pension schemes \u2013 it accounts for low business investment, the reliance of the private sector on the government to pay for research and development in things such as graphene, and the long squeeze on workers\u2019 pay that set in long before the banking crash.</p> <p>Under company law, shareholders go right to the back of the queue of dibs on a business\u2019s assets, after pension scheme members. But the big shareholders are the ones who get the face-time with the bosses, and executive pay is closely tied to share prices. Sure, pension savers are shareholders in other companies \u2013 but the number of big-fee-claiming middlemen standing between them and their assets is large enough to make that link thin indeed.</p> <p>Two obvious things can be done. Pensions holidays were always dangerous \u2013 now they should be made illegal. Second, as consultant John Ralfe argues, companies must guarantee their pension schemes. In the case of BHS, such a change would have put the Greens on the hook for the pensions \u2013 even without the intervention of Frank Field. Such changes will upset the financiers and the more irresponsible executives. They will put the kibosh on a few mergers and acquisitions. But big British business has its priorities wrong. It should be compelled to get them straight.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 24 August 2016 to clarify that estimates of losses members of the Tata Steel pension scheme could incur were calculated for the BBC.</p>",
  "<p> US trucks will produce 10% less carbon dioxide and consume 10% less fuel within a decade under the last major plank of Barack Obama\u2019s climate policy.</p> <p>The second phase of a new benchmark for medium- and large-sized trucks will cut more than 1bn metric tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions and 2bn barrels of oil use, the Environment Protection Agency announced on Tuesday.</p> <p>In fact, US heavy duty vehicles should emit at least 16% less CO2 than their European counterparts under the new rule, according to an analysis by the International Council on Clean Transportation (ICCT) last month, which the Guardian has seen.</p> <p> Gina McCarthy, the EPA\u2019s administrator, told the Guardian: \u201cIt is very clear that we are going to be moving out well ahead of any other country in the development of these standards. We will be driving these technologies and as result we will benefit from them more than any other country.\u201d</p> <p>Although medium and heavy duty lorries only make up 4% of road traffic, they also suck up 22% of US oil transport demand, and that figure is rising fast.</p> <p>The emissions cut from honing their fuel economy would be \u201croughly equal to the greenhouse gases associated with the electricity and power use from all US residences for one year\u201d, McCarthy said. </p> <p>Under the new rule, heavy duty trucks made in 2027 will be 25% more carbon efficient than models built in 2018, saving drivers $170bn in fuel costs and creating a $230bn net benefit to society, the EPA said.</p> <p>The standard is <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/tipsheets/morning-transportation/2016/08/waiting-on-truck-emissions-mandates-215873\">thought unlikely</a> to deliver the fuel savings of 54.5 miles a gallon promised by Obama in his first term. A boom in sales of trucks and sports-utility vehicles triggered by cheap gasoline prices may have pushed that out of reach.</p> <p>But it was still hailed as a \u201csignificant milestone\u201d for future generations by Anthony Foxx, the US transport secretary. </p> <p>The commercial vehicles rule will apply to semi-trucks, large pickup trucks, vans, buses and work trucks, and cut fuel costs by about $170bn, according to the EPA. It will be phased in over three stages, in 2021, 2024 and 2027. </p> <p>Brussels will pay close attention to the new law, after <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/transport/themes/strategies/news/doc/2016-07-20-decarbonisation/com(2016)501_en.pdf\">an EU proposal for similar post-2020 targets</a> last month pledged to regulate trucks for the first time.</p> <p>One European car industry source told the Guardian: \u201cThis announcement is obviously good news for the climate and for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/jun/02/everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-paris-climate-summit-and-un-talks\">the INDC commitments</a> made by the world\u2019s states in Paris. But it is important for car manufacturers that \u2013 as well as a framework and visibility \u2013 we are given the time to implement [the rule].\u201d</p> <p>McCarthy said that aspects of the proposal might be seen as \u201ctoo aggressive\u201d in some industry quarters, but that the EPA believed they \u201chit the absolute sweet spot,\u201d balancing cost-effective emissions and fuel-saving reductions. </p> <p> Heavy goods vehicles <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/clima/policies/transport/vehicles/index_en.htm\">make up 6% of Europe\u2019s total greenhouse gas emissions</a> \u2013 more than aviation or international shipping.</p> <p> Between 1990 and 2010 their emissions soared by 36%, and EU officials see little chance of a decline without policy action, which they have pledged to bring forward before the end of 2017.</p> <p>A limit of 95 grams of CO2 per kilometre has already been set for cars by 2021 and campaigners warn that if European trucks do not follow the American example, they will soon be overtaken in the clean vehicles race.<br></p> <p> \u201cThis is as much about environmental leadership as about innovation,\u201d said Stef Cornelis, the cleaner and safer trucks officer at the Transport and Environment campaign group.</p> <p> \u201cIf the EU wants to remain the world\u2019s leader in truck manufacturing, it should table a fuel efficiency standard for trucks in 2017 with a more ambitious 2025 target than the US one. Anything less will mean further stagnation for trucks made in Europe.\u201d</p> <p>Europe is currently the largest heavy duty vehicle market without efficiency standards. </p> <p>The ICCT forecasts that the EU bloc will fall behind the US in tractor-trailer efficiency in 2020. By 2030, HDVs will account for 45% of Europe\u2019s on-road emissions by 2030, on present trends.</p>",

Both men were suspended from the wrestling team, and Parker later transferred to a different college in Oklahoma.</p> <p>Parker, who had had an earlier sexual encounter with the victim that both said was consensual, was acquitted of the charges in 2001; Celestin was initially found guilty. He then appealed the verdict and was granted a new trial in 2005 \u2013 but the case never came to court after the victim decided not to testify again.</p> <p>Although there was no retrial, the case led to a lawsuit filed by the Women\u2019s Law Project against the university over its treatment of sexual assault. That suit was settled with a cash sum and a vow to review procedures for sexual assault cases at the school. Court documents show that the woman said she was harassed by Parker and Celestin after she reported the incident to the police. She dropped out of college and is said to have attempted suicide.</p> <p>On Tuesday, Variety<a href=\"http://variety.com/2016/film/news/nate-parkers-accuser-committed-suicide-in-2012-her-brother-speaks-out-exclusive-1201838508/\"> carried an interview with the woman\u2019s older brother</a> Johnny, who said that she had killed herself in 2012.

He brought his six-year-old daughter to the Variety interview, and invited Deadline to his home, scattered with \u201cremnants of the five daughters who live with him all around\u201d.<br></p> <p>Fox Searchlight issued a statement to coincide with the two interviews: \u201cFox Searchlight is aware of the incident that occurred while Nate Parker was at Penn State.

The film company is also considering not granting new interviews with Parker from now until the film screens at the Toronto international film festival in September.</p> <p>Sources told Variety that Fox Searchlight wasn\u2019t aware of the allegations before buying the film \u2013 and had only learned about it after the deal was struck.</p> <p>Neither profile addressed the alleged comments made by Parker while promoting the 2014 romance Beyond the Lights, when he <a href=\"http://www.ebony.com/news-views/nate-parker-homophobic-comment-422#axzz4H99MH3tZ\">reportedly said</a> he would not play a gay character in order to \u201cpreserve the black man\u201d.

That is my community. That\u2019s me, it\u2019s who I am.\u201d</p> <p>Johnny, the brother of the woman who accused Parker of rape, told Variety: \u201cHis character should be under a microscope because of this incident. If you removed these two people, the project is commendable. But there\u2019s a moral and ethical stance you would expect from someone with regard to this movie.\u201d</p> <p>He added: \u201cI don\u2019t think a rapist should be celebrated. It\u2019s really a cultural decision we\u2019re making as a society to go to the theater and speak with our dollars and reward a sexual predator.\u201d</p> <p>Parker\u2019s character seems destined to come under increasing scrutiny as his film airs in cinemas around the world.

  "<p>Simon Jenkins writes that \u201cTo question China\u2019s good intentions in financing the power station [at Hinkley Point] is silly.

The China General Nuclear Group (CGN), which is involved in financing Hinkley Point, expects to build a new nuclear station with its own reactor at Bradwell in return for its involvement at Hinkley. This was agreed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/oct/21/hinkley-point-reactor-costs-rise-by-2bn-as-deal-confirmed\" title=\"\">by David Cameron and Xi Jinping last October</a>.</p> <p>The reactor it hopes to build is its small modular reactor Hualong One.</p> <p>CGN has just been indicted by the US authorities for exporting nuclear technology to China without authorisation (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/aug/11/nuclear-espionage-charge-for-china-firm-with-one-third-stake-in-hinkley-point\" title=\"\">Nuclear espionage charge for China firm with one-third stake in UK\u2019s Hinkley Point</a>, theguardian.com, 11 August).

Israel and&#xa0;the US planted the Stuxnet bug in the nuclear reactor at Bushehr in Iran in 2010.</p> <p>Hualong One would not be allowed in the US. Neither France nor Germany would allow China to build it in their countries. Is the UK really so desperate for Chinese funds to build Hinkley Point that it will allow China a major stake in the provision of electricity in the UK in return?<br><strong>Norman Dombey</strong><br><em>Professor emeritus of theoretical physics, University of Sussex, and former specialist advisor to the Commons select committee on energy</em></p> <p>\u2022 Simon Jenkins decries the potential deal with China over the Hinkley Point proposed nuclear power station. He argues that project is \u201creckless and absurdly expensive\u201d, and so it is. But there are other reasons for stopping this project, which many in China will appreciate. China is arguably the world leader in renewable energy, both in manufacturing for the world and in using itself. The intrinsic variability of most renewables (especially wind and solar) is no longer a misfit with the variability of human demand. Ever advancing telecommunications and electronic control systems allow the demand to be adjusted to fit the supply on a scale from household to national.</p> <p>Witness the sophisticated systems widely available for matching electrical loads and energy stores to solar power. Householders already use these; electrical grid operators are trialling methods for widespread integration of solar and wind power with load demand control, energy storage and price adjustment.</p> <p>The last thing such advances need is an untried gigawatt source of constant electricity generation that cannot be matched to demand, that is expensive, and whose waste is harmful and untreatable. There are many in China and France who share these views; ceasing Hinkley will be welcomed by them too.<br><strong>Dr John Twidell</strong><br><em>Horninghold, Leicestershire</em></p> <p>\u2022 I agree with Simon Jenkins that Hinkley is a dud, for many reasons that have been discussed in his article and elsewhere. However, I am saddened that he appears to dismiss wind, and implicitly all renewable energy sources, as not providing baseload electricity. At the same time that Hinkley has been generally given the red carpet, the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/mar/10/swansea-bay-tidal-lagoon-energy-project-hinkley-point-wales\" title=\"\">Swansea Bay tidal lagoon</a> and further similar projects have potential to produce 8% of our baseload electricity.</p> <p>The tidal lagoon project would last about three times as long as any nuclear power station \u2013 about 90 years.</p> <p>The cost of the Swansea lagoon is estimated to be \u00a31bn. So to achieve the full 8% of baseload electricity (more than Hinkley), perhaps about \u00a35bn would be needed to complete four or five similar projects in the UK \u2013 less than a third of the Hinkley costs. There is also no nuclear waste to manage for thousands of years. Tidal power flows into the lagoon for six hours, out for six hours and does this twice a day, giving reliable electricity for 24 hours a day.</p> <p>Swansea Bay tidal lagoon is the best alternative to Hinkley, so why is it not getting immediate government support and approval? Why is it not even being discussed?<br><strong>Steve Emsley</strong><br><em>Newcastle upon Tyne</em></p> <p>\u2022 To make a sound judgment on energy sources British citizens should be given the relevant facts.

Increasingly desperate measures are being taken to keep these newcomers out of the lakes \u2013 including the building of a \u201cfish wall\u201d.</p> <p> Authorities have constructed a 7.5ft wall near Fort Wayne, Indiana, in a bid to halt the onward advance of the Asian carp. The 2-mile-long earth berm, which replaced a temporary chain-link fence, is designed to stop the carp from swimming through Indiana\u2019s rivers into the Great Lakes ecosystem.</p> <p> The wall divides a <a href=\"http://www.lrwp.org/page/eagle-marsh\">marshland area</a> and cuts off one of the most vulnerable approach points to the Great Lakes. The US Army Corp of Engineers is currently working on a more sophisticated \u201clock and dam\u201d system that would allow water to pass through but keep invasive species from swimming through.</p> <p> \u201cMy dream is that one day we can tear down this berm,\u201d <a href=\"http://www.csmonitor.com/Environment/2016/0512/America-is-building-a-wall-to-keep-out-Asian-carp-video\">said</a> Betsy Yankowiak, director at Little River Wetlands Project, which co-owns the marsh.</p> <p> Asian carp were imported to the US in the 1970s to filter pond water in fish farms in Arkansas. Flooding allowed them to escape and spread northward. The species has no natural predators in the US and can gobble up 20% of its bodyweight in plankton each day. Some Asian carp grow to more than 100lbs and now represent the vast majority of biomass in the Illinois and Mississippi rivers.</p> <p>Careless release of pets and unwitting introduction via international travel has brought a number of harmful species to the US. It\u2019s feared that climate change will help expand the range of some invasive species, which can then out-compete native animals and disrupt ecosystems.</p> <p> Florida is often viewed as the frontline for invasive species in the US, with animals such as Burmese pythons, feral hogs and lion fish altering the ecology of the region. </p> <p> The state is now also home to the world\u2019s largest rodent, according to biologist Elizabeth Congdon.

He was dismissed as a clown by some, while helping motivate youngsters to turn to terrorism in Britain and Europe, and enjoyed frequent media appearances.</p> <p> He was a key figure in al-Muhajiroun before it was banned under terrorism legislation and relaunched itself as al-Ghurabaa, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2006/jul/18/terrorism.immigrationpolicy\">which again was banned</a> under terrorism laws. Successor groups in turn were banned under terrorism legislation, such as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2010/jan/12/islam4uk-banned-alan-johnson-islamist\">Islam4Uk</a> and Muslims Against Crusades.</p> <p>Commander Dean Haydon, the head of Scotland Yard\u2019s counter-terrorism command, said his team had trawled through 20 years of Choudary\u2019s statements to build the case against him. Haydon denied the extremist had been \u201callowed to run\u201d so intelligence could be gained on the aspirant jihadis he attracted.</p> <p>Haydon said of Choudary and Rahman: \u201cThese men have stayed just within the law for many years, but there is no one within the counter-terrorism world that has any doubts of the influence that they have had, the hate they have spread and the people that they have encouraged to join terrorist organisations.</p> <p>\u201cOver and over again we have seen people on trial for the most serious offences who have attended lectures or speeches given by these men.\u201d</p> <p>A conservative estimate is that no less than 100 people from Britain linked to Choudary or his groups have fought or supported violent jihad, according to counter-terrorism sources. The figures were supported by a leftwing anti-extremism group that has studied the influence of al-Muhajiroun and its successor groups.</p> <p>That number increases on taking into account those in Europe who joined organisations such as Isis after being involved with extremist groups Choudary helped establish or influence, such as in Belgium and the Netherlands.</p> <p>Choudary\u2019s influence in Europe was such that the Dutch intelligence agency <a href=\"https://english.aivd.nl/\">AIVD</a> assessed him to be a key influence in the spread of the jihadi movement in the Netherlands. A spokesperson for AIVD said it stood by its assessment of Choudary\u2019s central role in the UK first, and then Europe, set out in a 2014 document: \u201cSince the 1980s the UK has harboured an active Islamist movement propagating an anti-democratic, intolerant and sometimes explicitly violent ideology.</p> <p>\u201cAt its heart is the now banned group Islam4UK, previously known as al-Muhajiroun, al-Ghurabaa and Muslims Against Crusades. Its most familiar faces are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/dec/30/omar-bakri-son-killed-iraq-fighting-for-isis-report\">Omar Bakri</a> (currently resident in Lebanon) and Anjem Choudary, who acts as its spokesman. Modelling itself closely on this British movement, Sharia4Belgium was active in Belgium for several years \u2026\u201d</p> <p>The spokesperson for Dutch intelligence added that the fact Choudary operated publicly and could \u201cstep out of the shadows and into light\u201d was an inspiration for others to do the same.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"aff334678d0ef8ab6b1820b7c7b15df33a9907a8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/aff334678d0ef8ab6b1820b7c7b15df33a9907a8/0_189_3456_2074/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Belgians pay tribute to the victims of Brussels terror attacks, in Brussels, in March.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Belgians pay tribute to the victims of the terror attacks in Brussels in March.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nicolas Maeterlinck/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In Belgium, which is coping with the aftermath of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/mar/22/brussels-airport-explosions-heard\">terrorist attacks</a> in March and fearing more to come, Choudary helped set up Sharia4Belgium.</p> <p>According to the European law enforcement agency Europol, Sharia4Belgium \u201cengaged in organised indoctrination and recruitment of young people to participate in the armed conflict in Syria\u201d. Choudary praised its leader after more than 40 of its members were convicted of terrorism.</p> <p> The groups Choudary led were \u201cthe single biggest gateway to terrorism in recent British history\u201d, says one study on his activities, details of which are published here for the first time, from the leftwing group <a href=\"http://www.hopenothate.org.uk/\">Hope Not Hate</a>. It said: \u201cOver the last 15 years he has influenced and inspired over 100 Britons who have carried out or attempted to carry out terrorist attacks at home and abroad.\u201d</p> <p>According to research from Hope Not Hate, supported by a counter-radicalisation expert who has worked with al-Muhajiroun members, Choudary helped Isis gain British recruits.</p> <p>Hope Not Hate said: \u201cIn the six months following the creation of the Islamic State, Choudary was its biggest cheerleader in the English-speaking world and the network he helped create became the largest recruiter for IS in Europe.\u201d</p> <p>Choudary\u2019s ability to operate in plain sight, seemingly without legal sanction, raises many questions. Sources in Britain\u2019s Muslim community say Choudary was reported to the police, with some in the UK\u2019s Islamic communities left baffled about how he remained untouched for so long.</p> <p>Scotland Yard\u2019s counter-terrorism command had previously attempted to build criminal cases against Choudary, only to be rebuffed by the Crown Prosecution Service, which judged there was insufficient chance of gaining a conviction.</p> <p>Haydon said of the conviction reported for the first time: \u201cThe oath of allegiance [made by Choudary to Isis] was a turning point for the police. At last we had the evidence that they had stepped over the line and we could prove they supported Isis.\u201d</p> <p>Between August and September 2014, Choudary and Rahman posted speeches on YouTube encouraging support for Isis. An audio clip, lasting one hour and six minutes and uploaded to Choudary\u2019s YouTube channel on 9 September 2014, was played to jurors. Titled How Muslims Assess the Legitimacy of the Caliphate, the speech was played over the image of a map of northern Africa, the Middle East, north-west Asia and southern Europe. Choudary begins by setting out his views about the requirements of a legitimate Islamic caliphate, then explains why he sees Islamic State as meeting the criteria. \u201cThe lesson from this narration is that obedience to the caliph is an obligation, if they rule by the sharia. And to obey them obviously means they must be established,\u201d Choudary said. </p> <p>Estimates of how many people Choudary funnelled into violence range from 100 to 500. Hannah Stuart, of the <a href=\"http://henryjacksonsociety.org/\">Henry Jackson Society</a> thinktank, said: \u201cA quarter of all individuals convicted of Islamism-inspired terrorism and terrorism-related offences in the UK since 1999 had direct links with al-Muhajiroun (or its aliases), through public membership, al-Muhajiroun-linked activism or regular attendance at lectures and protests. One in 10 offenders had a proven personal relationship with Choudary in particular.\u201d</p> <p>British Muslims had complained about the media attention paid to Choudary and the impression given to audiences that he was representative of British Islamic thought.</p> <p>Miqdaad Versi, of the Muslim Council of Britain, said: \u201cMr Anjem Choudary has long been condemned by Muslim organisations and Muslims across the country, who consider him and his support for Daesh [Isis] to be despicable and contrary to the values of Islam and our nation. </p> <p>\u201cMany Muslims have long been puzzled why this man was regularly approached by the media to give outrageous statements that inflamed Islamophobia. </p> <p>One expert in counter-radicalisation said Choudary was useful for Isis in the early days, when it was looking to gain traction in the UK. But the likes of him are now needed barely at all because Isis\u2019s reputation in jihadi circles and its online machine has grown so much. \u201cThey don\u2019t need a middle man,\u201d said the expert.<br></p> <p>Choudary and Rahman will be sentenced next month and face a maximum of 10 years in prison.</p> <p>The home secretary, Amber Rudd, said: \u201cThe successful conviction of Anjem Choudary and Mohammed Rahman is recognition of the tireless efforts of police and security agencies to keep the people of this country safe.</p> <p>\u201cThese dangerous individuals were recruiting sergeants for Daesh. They poisoned the minds of vulnerable people and their warped and twisted propaganda offered support and succour to a murderous and barbaric terrorist organisation.</p> <p>\u201cThe government is clear. We will continue to confront those who promote hate and threaten our way of life. Together we will protect communities against extremism and defeat this toxic ideology.\u201d</p>",

  "<p>Lately, Craig Robinson is prone to saying \u201camazing\u201d a lot.

(Robinson drolly voices a box of grits named, well, Mr Grits.) Robinson also uses the word \u201camazing\u201d to describe his first experience of the Sundance film festival in January, where he won a special jury prize for his performance in Morris From America, in which he plays a widowed, hip-hop loving father to a 13-year-old boy.</p> <p>In person, Robinson might seem a bit weary from the lengthy promotional blitz for Morris From America (yawns punctuate his every few sentences), but the 44-year-old standup-comedian-turned-actor is nonetheless clearly jazzed to be at this stage in this career, with a packed schedule of projects. </p> <p>On top of his role in Sausage Party and Morris From America, Robinson has recently appeared in the second season of tech thriller Mr Robot, as the mysterious new addition Ray.

Robinson is quick to note, however, that he\u2019s no match for Hartigan when it comes to knowledge of the genre. \u201cThat guy is an onion,\u201d marvels Robinson. \u201cHe sure taught me some stuff.\u201d</p> <p>Where Robinson had to really step outside of his comfort zone, was in learning German for the part \u2013 a language with which he was not at all familiar.

Eddie Murphy earned an Oscar nomination for Dreamgirls, in which he played a drug-addicted R&amp;B star on the wane. Most recently, Sarah Silverman played against type as a drug-addicted mother in the intense drama I Smile Back. </p> <p>However, Robinson says his recent foray into drama wasn\u2019t conceived as a calculated ploy to find a new audience. \u201cIt\u2019s all organic, man.

After doing Morris, it made other people go: \u2018I can trust you with this.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>It hasn\u2019t all been plain sailing however: NBC canceled his comedy Mr Robinson after its first season in 2015, after underwhelming ratings and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/aug/15/suicide-squad-sausage-party-petes-dragon-us-box-office\">poor reviews</a> (it was described in the Guardian as \u201cCheers but without any of the funny parts\u201d).

  "<p>In his major policy speech on foreign policy delivered yesterday in the battleground state of Ohio, Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump finally made it clear who exactly should be barred from the United States: himself.</p> <p>The candidate plainly stated that \u201cthose who do not believe in our constitution, or who support bigotry and hatred, will not be admitted for immigration into the country\u201d. Since Trump, who is known to have expressed bigoted and hateful opinions about Mexicans and Muslims, and who has repeatedly demonstrated a tenuous grasp of the constitution, already resides in the United States, I assume he will opt for Mitt Romney-style self-deportation.</p> <p>Obviously, I\u2019m being sarcastic. But not that sarcastic, to be honest with you.</p> <p>We have become accustomed now to hearing a new version of Trump\u2019s Muslim ban almost every time the candidate opens his mouth on the issue, but we should remember that his proposal was born out of politics and not principle. In December 2015, rival candidate Ted Cruz was stealing Trump\u2019s thunder by saying the US was now \u201cat war\u201d because of the San Bernardino attacks. Trump had to one-up his competition, so he proposed a \u201ctotal and complete shutdown of Muslims entering this country\u201d, and everyone forgot about Cruz for the moment.</p> <p>Then, after the public debated the constitutionality of a religion-based ban, Trump later announced that he would instead \u201csuspend immigration from areas of the world when there is a proven history of terrorism against the United States, Europe, or our allies\u201d. Are we to assume that Trump isn\u2019t opposed to terrorism per se but only terrorism against the US and its friends?</p> <p>And by July, he stated that he would bar entry to those coming from \u201cterritories and terror states and terror nations\u201d, whatever that means. In the intervening months, as the website <a href=\"http://thinkprogress.org/\">thinkprogress.org</a> has <a href=\"https://thinkprogress.org/gops-attempt-to-soften-trump-s-language-on-a-muslim-ban-derailed-by-trump-himself-74beba29977b#.8wnlw5wxp\">pointed</a> out, he has exempted from the ban his own friends who are Muslim, Muslim Americans in the military, Muslim world leaders and Muslim athletes. Trump\u2019s Muslim ban has been remixed almost as <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p01sn5gv\">often</a> as Change the Beat by Fab 5 Freddy.</p> <p>The latest version of this failed immigration policy has Trump tilting back to the days of the cold war. Proposing an \u201cideological screening test\u201d, Trump now says that his program of \u201cextreme vetting\u201d will screen out those who \u201cdo not share our values and respect our people\u201d. Going further than his past proposals, Trump now demands we bar those \u201cwho have hostile attitudes towards our country or its principles \u2013 or who believe that Sharia law should supplant American law\u201d.</p> <p>It\u2019s hard to take any of this seriously. Trump is proposing that the freedoms of immigrants, and especially Muslims, entering this country be curtailed to the point that they cannot hold \u201chostile attitudes\u201d. But who is to decide when an attitude is hostile enough to warrant exclusion? Do we really expect the authorities to patrol not only our borders but also our thoughts? Does Donald Trump, of all people, not realize that you might say contradictory things about any given topic just to get ahead?</p> <p>Trump\u2019s precedent for this absurdity is the old McCarran-Walter Act of 1952, which sought to ban communist thought from the country, but which ended up keeping such notable people as Nobel-prize winning novelist Gabriel Garcia Marquez, French actor Yves Montand and Canadian politician Pierre Elliot Trudeau from crossing our borders.</p> <p>\u201cIt made us look to the rest of the world like a people other than the people we are\u201d is how the late US senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan characterized the policy. \u201cIt misrepresented America. It said we\u2019re afraid of ideas, can\u2019t handle them, don\u2019t like people speaking their minds. That\u2019s not who we are at all.\u201d</p> <p>Trump\u2019s unworkable policy proposal will further alienate Muslims around the world because it tells them they are guilty until they can prove to him they are innocent. It also insults all immigrants by policing their thoughts and beliefs and every citizen by suggesting we can\u2019t think for ourselves. For a man who says he bravely stands up to \u201cpolitical correctness\u201d, Donald Trump seems awfully ready to enshrine it into law. </p>",

  "<p>The US justice department is reported to have found evidence of Volkswagen acting criminally in connection with the emissions cheating scandal that plunged the German company into crisis.<br></p> <p>Federal prosecutors are weighing up whether to criminally charge VW and its employees or accept a multibillion-dollar settlement, according to <a href=\"http://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-said-to-uncover-evidence-of-criminal-acts-in-vw-probe-1471290998\">the Wall Street Journal</a>. The justice department and VW declined to comment on the discussions, which are said to have a soft deadline of Christmas 2016.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jul/26/volkswagen-emissions-scandal\">Volkswagen emissions scandal: $15bn settlement gets preliminary approval</a> </p> </aside>  <p>VW has admitted to deliberately cheating on US diesel emissions tests for several years and this summer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jul/26/volkswagen-emissions-scandal\">agreed to pay $15.3bn</a> (\u00a311.8bn) to its customers and regulators. <br></p> <p>However, the settlement did not preclude criminal charges, and at the time, deputy attorney general Sally Yates sought to reassure consumers that \u201c<a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/opa/speech/deputy-attorney-general-sally-q-yates-delivers-remarks-press-conference-announcing-147\">our criminal investigation remains active</a> and ongoing\u201d. </p> <p>\u201cWe will follow the facts wherever they go and we will determine whether to bring criminal charges against any companies or individual wrongdoers.\u201d<br></p> <p>It is unusual for US authorities to seek a criminal prosecution of companies or executives, with prosecutors tending to accept an admittance of guilt, an apology from the chief executive and multimillion-dollar fines.<br></p> <p> In 2014, Toyota paid $1.2bn to settle a criminal investigation into its attempt to mislead the public about a defect that caused unintended acceleration. Last year, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/sep/16/gm-close-settling-us-criminal-case-ignition-switches\">General Motors paid $900m</a> to end an investigation into an ignition switch defect, which cut engines and disabled systems such as power steering and airbags, linked to 124 deaths. </p> <p>Both companies agreed to the appointment of an independent monitor to oversee their safety practices for three years. A similar agreement is likely if prosecutors agree a settlement with VW.</p> <p>Three US states have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jul/19/volkswagen-sued-new-york-massachusetts-diesel-emissions\">launched lawsuits</a> alleging that VW executives knew the company\u2019s cars had been engineered to cheat US pollution tests and had concluded that \u201cbreaking the law and risking the imposition of fines was an acceptable cost of doing business\u201d.<br></p> <p>New York, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/massachusetts\">Massachusetts</a> and Maryland filed lawsuits last month alleging that former VW chief executive Martin Winterkorn and other top executives were involved in a campaign of \u201csystematic cheating and deception\u201d to mislead US regulators over the emissions of its diesel cars.</p> <p>An 84-page lawsuit filed by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/new-york\">New York</a> attorney general Eric Schneiderman alleged that VW had been adapting technology to make its cars\u2019 emissions appear loweras far back as 1999. The company went on to develop bespoke software, termed a \u201cdefeat device\u201d, that allowed its cars to produce up to 40 times as much pollution on the roads than under strict US emissions test conditions.</p> <p>The June settlement required VW to offer to buy back the 475,000 2.0-litre diesel cars it installed with illegal \u201cdefeat device\u201d software designed to trick regulators into believing that its cars were greener than they really were. The buyback is expected to cost VW $10bn. The cost could increase significantly if VW is also ordered to buy back 85,000 3.0-litre Audis, Porsches and SUVs sold since 2009.</p> <p>It was also ordered to spend $2bn on the construction of infrastructure to charge electric vehicles and develop zero-emission ride-sharing across the country. A further $2.7bn will be spent on helping the state replace old buses.</p>",
  "<p>As Donald Trump\u2019s poll numbers have dropped in recent weeks, bashing the <a href=\"http://www.slate.com/blogs/the_slatest/2016/08/14/trump_blames_disgusting_and_corrupt_media_for_weak_poll_numbers.html\">\u201cdisgusting and corrupt\u201d</a> media has become the centerpiece of his campaign. \u201cI\u2019m not running against Crooked Hillary, I\u2019m running against the crooked media,\u201d he<a href=\"http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/presidential-races/291377-trump-im-running-against-media-not-clinton\"> said at a rally</a> in Fairfield, Connecticut, over the weekend.</p> <p>His campaign is indeed a place where journalistic objectivity meets its limits, but it\u2019s not because we\u2019re deliberately gunning for him. There simply is no fairness in presenting both sides of a story when one side is consistently rubbish, to put it kindly, or a dumpster fire, in this cycle\u2019s parlance. Trump changes his mind like it\u2019s the weather and tells a lie every five minutes, going by Politico\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/03/trump-fact-check-errors-exaggerations-falsehoods-213730#ixzz42sQo6zu6\">best count</a>.<br></p> <p>Different outlets have handled Trump\u2019s unique challenge in different ways, but generally it means working harder.</p> <p>CNN and MSNBC have taken to <a href=\"http://www.mediaite.com/online/msnbc-uses-chyron-to-fact-check-donald-trumps-erroneous-claims-in-real-time/\">putting parentheticals</a> in their chyrons to correct erroneous claims in real time. The New York Times has started including the sweep of history in even the most straightforward news stories to demonstrate breaks from longstanding political norms.</p> <p>The fact-checkers, in particular, are working overtime.</p> <p>The Associated Press and most major television networks have started fact-checking virtually every speech he gives, something they didn\u2019t do in previous cycles. No fewer than<a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/erik-wemple/wp/2016/06/22/true-fact-checking-a-single-donald-trump-speech-required-10-ap-writers/?utm_term=.b031f87a914e\"> 12 AP reporters</a> were required to fact-check a single speech he gave earlier this summer, which they found to be \u201crife with distortion\u201d.</p> <p>Trump\u2019s also been keeping Politifact busy. As of late June,<a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2016/jun/29/fact-checking-2016-clinton-trump/\"> 95 of the site\u2019s 158 fact-checks of Trump</a> were rated \u201cfalse\u201d or \u201cpants on fire\u201d, while the same could be said for just 16% of Hillary Clinton\u2019s 120 rated statements.</p> <p>Even the typically staid Glenn Kessler, the Washington Post\u2019s fact-checker, is at his wit\u2019s end. He called <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2016/08/09/trumps-remarkable-suggestion-that-clintons-emails-led-to-an-iranian-defectors-death/\">one recent Trump comment</a> \u201camong the stupidest claims made so far in this campaign\u201d.</p> <p>A comment like Kessler\u2019s isn\u2019t evidence of bias; it\u2019s an example of telling it like it is. What\u2019s actually biased is mindless he-said, she-said reporting \u2013 and to allow such reporting is to allow a bias in Trump\u2019s favor, because so much of what he says isn\u2019t true.<br></p> <p>Of course, that hasn\u2019t stopped Trump from \u2013 wait for it \u2013 lying about reporters. \u201cYou\u2019ve seen it \u2013 the liberal media can\u2019t stop telling outrageous lies about me,\u201d he wrote in a recent fundraising email.</p> <p>The flip side of Trump continually lambasting media outlets is that he also reads coverage obsessively, calling his campaign manager \u201cseveral times a day\u201d to discuss specific stories, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/14/us/politics/donald-trump-campaign-gop.html?_r=0\">according to</a> the New York Times. The adulation of anything he deems to be flattering coverage is also quite possibly as unprecedented as all else in his campaign. </p> <p>As he put it at a rally in Radford earlier this year,<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/feb/29/trump-rally-photographer-secret-service-protests\"> \u201cabout 80%\u201d</a> of reporters are worse than the \u201csleazebags\u201d he works with in politics. The political press, he added, is \u201cthe worst of all\u201d.</p> <p>By saying there are still a few non-sleazebag journalists, he\u2019s left room for those who would tell the stories he wants told. Don\u2019t trust the media, just the members of the media writing nice things about me, he seem to be saying.</p> <p>What\u2019s less straightforward is what Trump perceives to be flattering. Take, for instance, the story of Tony Schwartz.</p> <p>In 1985, the then New York magazine writer Schwartz wrote a piece describing Trump as \u2013<a href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/07/25/donald-trumps-ghostwriter-tells-all\"> by Schwartz\u2019s own recollection</a> \u2013 \u201ca ham-fisted thug who had unsuccessfully tried to evict rent-controlled and rent-stabilized tenants from a building that he had bought\u201d. To his surprise, Trump, who was then trying to burnish his tough-guy image, was so taken with the piece he hung it on his wall. Trump especially loved that \u201ceverybody seemed to have read it\u201d, as he later gushed to Schwartz in a note on gold-embossed stationery. Soon after, he\u2019d entice Schwartz to leave journalism and ghostwrite the myth-making book Art of the Deal.</p> <p>Schwartz recounted all this in a New Yorker piece about how he regrets his role in creating the legend of Trump as a charmer and savvy businessman. He stated openly that he\u2019d never forgive himself if Trump were elected president. \u201cI genuinely believe that if Trump wins and gets the nuclear codes, there is an excellent possibility it will lead to the end of civilization,\u201d<a href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/07/25/donald-trumps-ghostwriter-tells-all\"> he wrote</a>.</p> <p>For journalists, that story is more than good reading \u2013 it\u2019s a cautionary tale: the moment we buy into Trump\u2019s notions about what constitutes biased versus unbiased coverage, we buy into the logic of a master propagandist.</p> <p>Voters should understand that, too.</p> <p>To have a low opinion of Trump\u2019s suitability for higher office, to write critically about him regardless of how many journalistic outlets he blacklists in retaliation, is not a mark of bias \u2013 it\u2019s a badge of honor. And journalists tellingly boast about it as such.</p> <p>Trump\u2019s right that the media does not have a high opinion of his political fitness, but he\u2019s wrong that that makes us corrupt.

  "<p>Jessamyn Stanley teaches yoga. She has written a book about it.

Stanley isn\u2019t white, and she isn\u2019t skinny.

Among the comments from other yoga enthusiasts, however, people also said that Stanley had inspired them. </p> <p>A caption on a <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/vHJ6JhEO4A/?hl=en\">photo from 2014 reads</a>: \u201cI am so glad you have this page and I found you. Before seeing you in these pictures I didn\u2019t think this was possible. Thought I had to lose 100 pounds before doing anything like this. Thank you, thank you, thank you.\u201d </p> <p>Stanley was shocked; she\u2019d never considered that her body might be a hindrance to her ability to take up any form of physical activity. She had a few hang-ups about her size, but never saw that as a reason not to be able to do yoga. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>There\u2019s a major disconnect in our society between what people can do and what we show people that they can do</p> <footer> <cite>Jessamyn Stanley</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cWhen I was [first] photographing myself, I would look at the pictures and think, oh, my belly is there and it\u2019s fat,\u201d she said. \u201cBut over time, I realized that I\u2019m really strong to be able to hold these poses.

  "<p>Donald Trump may be the only presidential candidate in history to think that the era of the cold war and Senator Joseph McCarthy\u2019s communist witch-hunts is something to emulate. On Monday, he expanded his anti-terror policy \u2013 which has included a \u201ctotal and complete shutdown\u201d of America\u2019s borders to Muslims \u2013 by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/15/donald-trump-immigration-test-isis-islamic-state-foreign-policy\">calling for a revival</a> of McCarthyism. \u201cIn the cold war we had an ideological screening test ... The time is overdue for a new test. I call it extreme vetting,\u201d he said in his speech.</p> <p>But it\u2019s not just McCarthy that Trump is channeling. Sadly, America has a long history of reactionary anti-immigrant attitudes, and if Trump were to be successful, he would revive some of the worst policies in our country\u2019s history.<br></p> <p>The founding fathers saw the value in opening America\u2019s borders. Among the litany of complaints against King George III in the <a href=\"http://www.archives.gov/exhibits/charters/declaration_transcript.html\">Declaration of Independence</a>, one grievance was that the king had \u201cendeavoured to prevent the population of these States; for that purpose obstructing the Laws for Naturalization of Foreigners; refusing to pass others to encourage their migrations hither.\u201d<br></p> <p>Alexander Hamilton \u2013 an immigrant himself \u2013 <a href=\"http://what-when-how.com/the-american-economy/report-on-the-subject-of-manufactures-1791/\">was eager</a> to \u201copen every possible [avenue to] emigration from abroad\u201d, seeing only the benefit for labor and manufacturing. His rival Thomas Jefferson wasn\u2019t so sure. While Jefferson <a href=\"http://xroads.virginia.edu/~hyper/jefferson/ch08.html\">noted</a> that migrants who came of their own accord should be \u201centitled to all the rights of citizenship\u201d, he cautioned the US to be wary of too much immigration. Jefferson feared that many immigrants, coming from countries ruled by \u201cabsolute monarchies\u201d, wouldn\u2019t be able to adjust to democracy, and he worried such people would have the effect of turning his home state of Virginia into \u201ca heterogeneous, incoherent, distracted mass\u201d.<br></p> <p>Sound familiar? Well, let\u2019s not brand Trump a Jeffersonian quite yet. After all, it was also <a href=\"https://www.loc.gov/loc/lcib/9806/danpre.html\">Jefferson who called for</a> a \u201cwall of separation between church &amp; state\u201d, and who was a <a href=\"http://religionandpolitics.org/2014/04/09/thomas-jeffersons-quran/\">student of the Qu\u2019ran</a>. His friend James Madison, an architect of the US constitution, similarly <a href=\"http://press-pubs.uchicago.edu/founders/documents/amendI_religions49.html\">argued:</a> \u201cFreedom arises from [a] multiplicity of sects, which pervades America ... For where there is such a variety of sects, there cannot be a majority of any one sect to oppress and persecute the rest.\u201d<br></p> <p>As it turned out, immigration wasn\u2019t much of a political factor in the first decades of America\u2019s history as only a few thousand people came to America each year. Then, with the famine following the failure of the potato crop in Ireland in 1845 \u2013 along with a series of failed revolutions in Germany, Poland, Hungary and elsewhere in 1848 \u2013 America\u2019s immigrant population grew rapidly. For example, New York\u2019s population was 312,000 in 1840; by 1850, it had become 515,000, <a href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=2OR2yeASrfIC&amp;lpg=PA41&amp;ots=Horvx5JhRJ&amp;dq=new%20york%20city%20population%201845&amp;pg=PA42#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false\">nearly half of them foreign-born</a>.<br></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/aug/16/donald-trump-extreme-vetting-immigrants-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/5v4c6\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2660451\"            data-video-name=\"Trump says no immigration to US without 'extreme vetting' \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"AP\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-57b3292ae4b0c23bfed8a091\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/08/16/160816trump_KP-28817945_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/08/16/160816trump_KP-28817945.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/08/16/160816trump_KP-28817945_WebM.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/aug/16/donald-trump-extreme-vetting-immigrants-video\">Trump says no immigration to US without \u2018extreme vetting\u2019</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>Anti-immigrant reaction was swift; the Catholic Irish, in particular, bore the brunt of American bigotry. A major political party, the Know-Nothings or Nativist Party, was formed on an anti-immigrant platform. By 1856, the Know-Nothings were running former president <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/aug/18/donald-trump-immigration-know-nothing-dangerous-republicans\">Millard Fillmore</a> as their candidate, promising that \u201c<a href=\"http://www.yale.edu/glc/archive/974.htm\">Americans must rule America</a>\u201d.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Chinese immigration had accelerated on the west coast, and many Chinese found themselves the objects of cultural, racial and economic enmity. This led, in 1882, to the first and only law the US has ever passed essentially banning a specific nationality: <a href=\"https://history.state.gov/milestones/1866-1898/chinese-immigration\">the Chinese Exclusion Act</a>. The original law placed a 10-year moratorium on Chinese immigration and required those in the US to carry the proper papers or risk deportation. </p> <p>The act wasn\u2019t repealed until 1943, when having China as an ally against Japan was more important than immigration law; however, by that point, the 1924 Naturalization Act had made it difficult for any foreigners to come to the US. That law, aimed at curbing Italian and eastern European migration, established a quota system that wasn\u2019t abolished until 1965.</p> <p>The start of the cold war saw Americans focused on a more insidious enemy: communists. Because communism was an ideology, not an easily recognizable ethnicity, Senator McCarthy and the far-right John Birch Society saw potential \u201creds\u201d everywhere. Catching a few high-profile spies (such as Julius and Ethel Rosenberg) only added to the general paranoia \u2013 much as attacks like those in San Bernadino and Orlando fuel concerns about domestic terrorism today.<br></p> <p>McCarthy wasn\u2019t alone. It was Harry Truman that first instituted <a href=\"http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/truman-orders-loyalty-checks-of-federal-employees\">federal loyalty oaths</a> in 1947, and it was Dwight Eisenhower who had \u201cunder God\u201d added to the pledge of allegiance to separate Americans from <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2002/06/28/us/with-little-ado-congress-put-god-in-pledge-in-1954.html\">godless communists</a>. It is true that there were actual Soviet spies in America, just as there are terrorists here today. They just weren\u2019t lurking around every corner or infiltrating every government office.<br></p> <p>It is easy to dismiss Donald Trump. Nearly everything that comes out his mouth is absurd (sorry, \u201c<a href=\"http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/isis-donald-trump-stumbles-over-sarcasm\">sarcasm</a>\u201d). But when <a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/donald-trump-proposes-extreme-vetting-immigrants-ideological-screening/story?id=41392682\">he says</a>: \u201cWe must also screen out any who have hostile attitudes toward our country or its principles,\u201d he is not an outlier. Jefferson could easily have said something very similar.<br></p> <p>When Trump goes on to note that \u201cto put these new procedures in place, we will have to temporarily suspend immigration from some of the most dangerous and volatile regions of the world\u201d, he is unfortunately upholding a long American tradition.<br></p> <p>This isn\u2019t to say he\u2019s correct: America\u2019s greatest strength is its diversity, and as Hamilton rightly argued, immigrants are the backbone of the country\u2019s economy. Moreover, in the same way the communism was not undermining America at every turn in the 1950s, neither is Islam eating away at the fabric of the country today. </p> <p>Still, it\u2019s important to recognize that while Trump\u2019s attitudes may be repugnant, they are not, historically speaking, particularly shocking. In the end, that\u2019s probably the most important reason that his policies should never have the chance to be enacted. America has a long history of treating immigrants poorly; now is the time for us to set a better course.<br></p>",

Latina women lose more than a million dollars over their careers in 23 states, including the District of Columbia where the gap is highest at $1,781,720. </p> <p>\u201cA big driver of the wage gap is the gap in opportunities that push Latinas and African American women into different occupations than white men. Latina women and African American women are over-represented in low-wage jobs, for example, and under-represented in high-paying occupations like law and engineering,\u201d said Emily Martin, vice-president for workplace justice at NWLC.</p> <p>The report comes a week before African American Equal Pay Day, which takes place on the day black women catch up to white men\u2019s pay from 2015. Latina Equal Pay Day takes place in November.</p> <p>In 2014, black women earned 60 cents for every dollar earned by white men. That means that the average black woman would have to work 20 months to earn what a white man earns in 12 months.</p> <p>\u201cAfrican American women shouldn\u2019t need to work more than 66 years to earn what a white man earns in 40 years,\u201d said Martin. \u201c If we don\u2019t act now to ensure equal pay, for many women of color, the cost of the lifetime wage gap will surpass a million dollars. We literally can\u2019t afford to ignore this.\u201d<br></p> <p>There are six states, including the District of Columbia, where the gap has already surpassed $1m:</p> <ul> <li><strong>District of Columbia: </strong>$1,595,200<br></li> <li><strong>New Jersey:</strong> $1,231,600<br></li> <li><strong>Connecticut:</strong> $1,140,400<br></li> <li><strong>Louisiana:</strong> $1,134,880<br></li> <li><strong>California:</strong> $1,046,960<br></li> <li><strong>Massachusetts:</strong> $1,022,440</li> </ul> <p>According to NWLC, even black women with a high level of education still experience a wage gap. \u201cAfrican American women with a bachelor\u2019s degree typically make $46,825 per year \u2013 only $1,849 more than white men with only a high school degree,\u201d NWLC pointed out.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/apr/13/hillary-clinton-equal-pay-day-minimum-wage-gender-gap\">Calling for equal pay, Hillary Clinton shares little about her own experience</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Earlier this year when celebrating equal pay day for all women, Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton called for more transparency around pay in the private sector and expressed her support of the Paycheck Fairness Act. The legislation, which says that workers who talk about their pay with coworkers cannot be fired or retaliated against, has been introduced in every Congress since 1997. While serving in the US Senate, Clinton co-sponsored the bill during the 2005-2006 and 2007-2008 sessions.</p> <p>\u201cIf talking about equal pay and paid leave and more opportunities for women and girls is playing the gender card, then deal me in,\u201d she said earlier this year on Equal Pay Day, which took place on the one-year anniversary of her presidential campaign. </p> <p>While speaking at the Republican national convention, Ivanka Trump surprised many when she said that her father, too, will fight for equal pay for women. </p> <p>\u201cHe will fight for equal pay for equal work,\u201d said Trump, daughter of the Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump. </p> <p>Trump has previously spoken in support of equal pay without committing to any policies or expressing support of the Paycheck Fairness Act. </p> <p>\u201cIf they do the same job they should get the same pay,\u201d Trump <a href=\"http://www.msnbc.com/morning-joe/watch/trump-on-equal-pay-509295171617\">said</a> last year while appearing on MSNBC\u2019s Morning Joe. \u201cBut it\u2019s very hard to say what\u2019s the same job. It\u2019s a very, very tricky question and I have talked about competition with other places and other parts of the world, this is one of those things that we have to look at very strongly.\u201d </p> <p> </p>",
  "<p>\u2018We all feel alone and isolated at times,\u201d says Stephen Graham. \u201cYou question whether you\u2019ve been a good father, husband, friend. That\u2019s human instinct, asking what we\u2019re trying to achieve with our lives.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s easy to see why an actor like Graham would fancy a show like <a href=\"http://www.channel4.com/programmes/the-watchman?promo=coming_soon\">The Watchman</a>. More or less a single-hander, it casts him as Carl, a solitary CCTV operator who tries to bring down some drug dealers on an estate after the police refuse to respond to his tip-offs. For someone rarely granted leading-man status (\u201cI\u2019m never going to be Mr Darcy, but I\u2019m always going to be the man that kicks Mr Darcy in the balls,\u201d he has said), it\u2019s a gift.</p> <p>It slots into a frankly chaotic CV that has embraced Hollywood blockbusters (Gangs of New York, Pirates of the Caribbean), prestige TV (Boardwalk Empire, This is England) and microbudget indies (too many to mention) since his 2000 breakthrough in <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nd7df-Yv_Z4\">Snatch</a>. Perhaps the only common thread is how many roles have leant on his coiled, pitbull physicality. Here, though, the cameras are trained, for much of the hour, on his face. I watch Graham filming a scene in the Watford warehouse that contains the CCTV station. His expression morphs from anger to fear and, finally, mute horror as Carl\u2019s plans go south. It\u2019s mesmerising. </p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve got to be at the peak of my concentration all the time,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s great because it adds to the pressure Carl\u2019s feeling.\u201d He picks up this thread a few weeks later, chatting from his home in Leicestershire, where he lives with his wife Hannah Walters (who played Trudy in This is England) and children Grace and Alfie. \u201cI\u2019ve had moments where I could have gone down one road but took another,\u201d he says. \u201cThankfully, I made the right decisions most of the time. And I\u2019d rather not elaborate,\u201d he adds, pre-empting my next question. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"60bc9accbbdd50b7e01d760b6c1f808f3741c66a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/60bc9accbbdd50b7e01d760b6c1f808f3741c66a/0_81_1299_779/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Stephen Graham as Combo in This is England\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018I was going to pack it in and become a youth worker\u2019 \u2026 after he played Combo in This is England, no one in the industry would touch him.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sportsphoto Ltd/Allstar</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Off-set, Graham is as disarmingly genial as his best-known characters \u2013 This is England\u2019s National Front hardnut Combo, Boardwalk Empire\u2019s rising crimelord Al Capone \u2013 are dangerously sociopathic. He concedes that he\u2019d certainly take the law into his own hands if his children were in danger. \u201cBut I\u2019m lucky,\u201d he adds. \u201cI can express those urges through my characters, without having to do it myself.\u201d</p> <p>Without his family, he might have given it all up. So incendiary was his 2006 debut as Combo that casting directors wouldn\u2019t touch him. \u201cI couldn\u2019t get work for eight months,\u201d he says. \u201cI was going to pack it in and become a youth worker, but Hannah told me to stick at it. She\u2019s talked me down off mountains at work. I was on recently about having had a heavy day, thinking about losing the kids to get myself upset for a scene. She said: \u2018All you\u2019re doing is pretending to get upset about the kids, love. I\u2019ve been doing that for real since seven this morning!\u2019 There wasn\u2019t much I could say to that \u2026\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s no coincidence that family, surrogate or otherwise, humanises his greatest screen monsters, whether it\u2019s Capone\u2019s concern for his deaf son or Combo\u2019s doomed devotion to Lol. Indeed, Combo was last seen being dragged off to apparent certain death screaming the names \u201cGrace\u201d and \u201cAlfie\u201d. </p> <p>\u201cWe decided Combo had been in care after saving his brother and sister from an abusive relationship, so I used my children\u2019s names to get into character.\u201d It wasn\u2019t the first time real family has intruded. \u201cMy uncle John\u2019s been in prison for 15 years, and the letter Combo reads out to the parole board is exactly what my uncle said when he was up to be moved to a category D prison.

It\u2019s easier to chastise than to encourage, promote and provide opportunities to excel. I used to go to the youth club every day after school. Some children just go home to their bedrooms because that\u2019s the only space they have to themselves. The cutbacks are dramatic, but there has to be a way to turn it round.\u201d</p> <p>Ten years on from his first outing as Combo, he is in ceaseless demand. There\u2019s Taboo, a period drama series with Tom Hardy. Little Boy Blue, a miniseries about the Rhys James shooting in 2007. The latest instalment of Pirates of the Caribbean. Even a rare comedy, playing opposite Jack Whitehall in the BBC\u2019s Evelyn Waugh adaptation Decline and Fall. \u201cI just want to keep doing something that has a voice,\u201d he says. \u201cI can come into people\u2019s living rooms and make them think about themselves and about society.\u201d</p> <p> What options were open to you when you were young, I ask, half-expecting a story of narrowed horizons in Thatcher-era Merseyside. \u201cAnything,\u201d he says. \u201cMy parents gave me that belief. They made sure I had opportunities, even when they had to scrimp and save for me to go away with the National Youth Theatre. I could have done anything.\u201d</p> <p><em>The Watchman is on Channel 4 at 9pm on Wednesday 24 August.</em></p>",
  "<p>If ever there was an athlete to put a smile on a nation\u2019s face, it surely was Nicola Adams. But the most effervescent member of the Great Britain Olympic squad had to bite down hard on her gumshield here on Tuesday to secure at least a bronze with a one-fight passage through to the semi-finals.</p> <p>The judges gave her a clear margin \u2013 40-36, 39-37, 39-37 \u2013 against the lively 28-year-old Ukrainian Tetyana Kob and she can breathe easy before her second bout, a rematch against China\u2019s Ren Cancan, whom <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/aug/09/nicola-adams-olympic-boxing-gold\" title=\"\">she beat in London for her debut gold four years ago</a>.</p> <p>The 33-year-old Leeds flyweight was happy enough with her performance and said: \u201cI\u2019m into the medals. She was a tough opponent, did not stop coming forward, really aggressive, quite strong. I just had to get through it; it was one of those working fights.\u201d</p> <p>Adams also had a couple of tricky engagements on her way to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/may/27/nicola-adams-wins-world-boxing-title-full-gold-medal-set\" title=\"\">winning the world title in May</a>. Over four rounds of two minutes each the margin for error is slim, and she knows she will have no such luxury against Ren, who scored an easier points win over the Canadian Mandy Bujold.</p> <p>\u201cI was a little bit off with the ring rust,\u201d Adams said, \u201cbut, as the rounds go on now, I\u2019ve got the first fight out of the way, and I\u2019ll improve in the next fight. I\u2019ve been here four weeks and quite anxious to get in there and perform. Maybe next time, I might come out a little bit later.\u201d</p> <p>Was that a hint that she was thinking about boxing on until the Tokyo Olympics? \u201cI\u2019m not sure yet,\u201d is all she would say. She knows she has plenty of work to do here first. \u201cThis means everything to me. I came here for a medal, but I always want the gold.\u201d</p> <p>Although she has not been to any other events, she has been watching with the rest of the Great Britain team in the Olympic village. \u201cMo Farah, absolutely fantastic. For him to fall over and still get up and win shows true grit and determination, but that\u2019s what it takes to be a champion. Even when you\u2019re down, you have to find a way to get back up, push on, fight on and win those medals.\u201d</p> <p>Adams received kind treatment for a sluggish start, all three judges apparently ill-disposed to reward the Ukrainian for catching her more illustrious opponent with a couple of eye-catching head shots in the first round \u2013 and in centre ring. They were hard to miss.</p> <p>But the reigning champion started to move with more awareness for oncoming traffic in the second, presenting a more elusive target, and, with the cushion of that lead, she let the punches flow freely, especially with some neat counter-rights to the rib cage. They went to it in a mid\u2011round exchange that neither seemed to dominate and Adams got her jab going, along with an uppercut to the solar plexus, to shade the session.</p> <p>This time, however, she got the nod from two of the judges, which seemed mildly perverse \u2013 from this seat in the faraway press box, anyway. Adams looked more in control than in the first.</p> <p>Still, she had only to keep the shape in her boxing in the closing two rounds to go through. Kob, growing desperate, threw wildly and had intermittent success, but not enough. The officials again gave two of their three cards to Adams in the third.</p> <p>And so to the fourth, for two minutes of hectic leather-swapping, where style and form often evaporate. Adams, still reaching for a convincing rhythm against a difficult opponent, managed to land more consistently on the retreat and did the more obvious work in front of the judges, although she took a couple of heavy shots on the bell.</p> <p>She had done enough but, it has to be said, it was not the sort of performance to encourage confidence in her push for another gold medal. The next fight will be an altogether more demanding experience.</p>",
  "<p>For some, the results of the Center for Disease Control and Preventions\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/65/ss/ss6509a1.htm\">landmark study</a> on lesbian, gay and bisexual youth were not surprising. \u201cIt reminded me a lot of my experiences in school,\u201d Joshua Deese, a University of Maryland student and volunteer with <a href=\"http://www.thetrevorproject.org/\">the Trevor Project</a>, a national suicide intervention and prevention organization, said. Growing up in a small Florida town, Deese was verbally and physically bullied in high school, both before and after he came out as gay.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/15/california-lgbt-school-history-curriculum-new-law\">LGBT history is coming to California classrooms, a first in the nation</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The CDC\u2019s report, published last Thursday, was the first nationally representative study to ask high school students about their sexuality. The data showed that lesbian, gay and bisexual (LGB) teens face higher levels of physical and sexual violence and bullying than other students and have an increased risk of suicidal thoughts and other serious health outcomes.</p> <p>There are approximately 1.3 million LGB high school students in the country, according to the CDC. <a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/nchhstp/newsroom/docs/2016/lgb-media-data-summary.pdf\">LGB students were</a> three times more likely than their heterosexual peers to be forced into sexual intercourse and more than two times as likely to have experienced physical or sexual dating violence. They were more than two times as likely to feel sad or hopeless. Of LGB students, 12.5% had skipped school because they felt unsafe, compared to 4.6% of heterosexual students. They were about two times as likely to have been bullied at school or electronically. The likelihood of drug use by LGB students was up to five times that of their heterosexual peers. They were about three times as likely to have seriously considered suicide and more than four times as likely to have attempted suicide.</p> <p>The data came from the 2015 National Youth Risk Behavior Survey (YRBS), a biennial survey of teen health conducted by the CDC. This was the first year that it included two questions on sexual orientation and sex of sexual contacts, making the analysis of data specific to LGB teens possible. The CDC analyzed data from more than 15,000 high school students, in addition to 25 state surveys and 19 large urban school district surveys.</p> <p>The findings did not include data on students who identified as trans or a non-binary gender. They also did not include dropouts, which the CDC said may be composed of a disproportionate amount of lesbian, gay or bisexual youth. According to the <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/12/health/gay-lesbian-teenagers-violence.html\">New York Times</a>, a question on gender identity \u201cmight be ready for a pilot test in 2017\u201d for eventual inclusion on the YRBS.</p> <p>The CDC\u2019s report wasn\u2019t designed to look at what might be causing the high risks for LGB teens. Emily Greytak, the director of research with the <a href=\"http://www.glsen.org/\">Gay, Lesbian and Straight Education Network</a> (GLSEN), said that a feeling of trauma or discrimination could lead to high risk behaviors. But she also said that a \u201csmall percentage of the students that you go to school with can make your life hell even if you have a majority who are neutral or don\u2019t care or are supportive\u201d.</p> <p>For Mia Healy, a recent high school graduate from New Jersey, many of her classmates were supportive when she came out as a lesbian, but others called her an \u201cattention whore\u201d for her sexuality or told her that \u201cgay people are equivalent to shit\u201d in response to her <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wC3BiJLqSRk\">art project</a> exploring gender.</p> <p>David W Bond, the vice-president of programs for the Trevor Project, said victimization was one of the risk factors for suicide. When it came to dating violence, he said it could go unreported by teens who are afraid to be outed.</p> <p>Greytak also theorized that there was a harsh backlash to efforts like marriage equality or recent anti-discrimination bills, creating a negative environment for students. Since the CDC\u2019s data was collected throughout 2015, it didn\u2019t take into account recent events \u2013 such as North Carolina\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/mar/25/north-carolina-lgbt-rights-transgender-discrimination-law-violates-us-constitution\">bathroom law</a> or the backlash to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/jul/08/states-sue-federal-government-transgender-bathroom-policy\">Barack Obama\u2019s order</a> for trans students be allowed to use the bathroom of their choosing. \u201cIt\u2019ll be interesting to see the 2017 [study] after all of the anti-trans legislation, which is just kicking back up more homophobia in the school systems and legitimizing discrimination against gender nonconforming and transgender students,\u201d said Geoffrey Winder, the co-executive director of the <a href=\"https://gsanetwork.org/\">Genders &amp; Sexualities Alliance (GSA) Network</a> (formerly the Gay-Straight Alliance Network).</p> <p>The CDC made recommendations in its report for public health action, including bolstering existing anti-bullying and harassment policies, safe spaces for students and educating staff on forging inclusive environments. </p> <p>The GSA Network receives funding from the CDC\u2019s division of adolescent and school health. One of its programs in conjunction with the CDC, called <a href=\"http://outforsafeschools.org/\">Out For Safe Schools</a>, distributes badges to educators to show that they\u2019re <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/teacher-network/2016/apr/10/what-not-say-lgbt-pupils-if-they-come-out-teachers\">supportive of LGB students</a>. The sight of the badges at a San Diego high school brought Christopher White, the director of safe and supportive school project at the GSA network, to tears. \u201cA student saw a teacher wearing one and she thought, \u2018Oh cool, she\u2019s part of the club. She\u2019s someone I can talk to,\u2019\u201d he recalled.</p> <p>The organization also supports students in forming their own <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jan/15/mississippi-schoolsefforts-gay-straight-alliance-membership\">GSA clubs</a>. Winder started his own GSA back in the beginning of the movement in 1998. Deese said his last two years of high school were improved by starting a GSA, as it helped non-LGBT students to become more understanding.</p> <p>For the past six years, Deese has been volunteering with the Trevor Project and is now part of the organization\u2019s Washington DC ambassador\u2019s council. He found the organization when he was searching for gay resources online and said it saved his life. The organization has a 24/7 crisis hotline, as well as texting and chatting services and a social networking site for LGBT teens, which can sometimes be the only supportive resource for teens living in more hostile environments.</p> <p>In addition to their own programs, these organizations had recommendations for additional reforms to improve school climate, centered around inclusivity and changes in bullying policies. Winder warned in particular against bullying policies which could make a student feel like their sexuality is at fault.</p> <p>Greytak had four key recommendations for schools: anti-bullying and anti-discrimination policies that are actively implemented and well-known; supportive and trained educators; clubs and organizations; and inclusive curriculums that are \u201creflective of the world\u201d. \u201cLGB youth need to see themselves reflected in the curriculum and non-LGB youth really need to see other people reflected in the curriculum as well to break down prejudice and barriers,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Bond said schools needed to adopt suicide prevention programs that were LGBTQ inclusive and promote prevention education in a way that wouldn\u2019t create a \u201csuicide contagion\u201d or cause students to think suicide was part of their identity.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/03/transgender-student-bathroom-virginia-supreme-court-order\">Supreme court blocks order to let transgender student use boys' bathroom</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cDo not be afraid to ask someone: are you thinking of killing yourself?

Greytak said eight states \u2013 Alabama, Arizona, Lousiana, Mississippi, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Texas and Utah \u2013 had laws which \u201cforbid educators from talking about LGBT issues in a positive light or at all\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cCan you imagine?

  "<p>Jeremy Corbyn has hinted he would be able to forget the criticism of fellow Labour MPs if he were to win the leadership race, following a rally in Derby where he reiterated his commitment to the full nationalisation of rail services.</p> <p>Speaking to reporters after his speech on Tuesday, Corbyn was asked about comments by the Derby South MP, Margaret Beckett, who said many people had joined the party purely to support him.</p> <p>\u201cWe have had examples of people saying: \u2018I want to join the Labour party because of Jeremy, but of course if he ceases to be the leader I shall leave,\u2019\u201d she told the BBC. \u201cThose are not members of the Labour party, those are members of a fan club.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/aug/16/jeremy-corbyn-floor-three-hour-train-journey-london-newcastle\">Corbyn joins seatless commuters on floor for three-hour train journey</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Corbyn said he was happy to continue to work with Beckett, and that the pair had recently spoken about nuclear disarmament. \u201cPeople say a lot of things and I think I\u2019ve got the ability to forget those things,\u201d he said.</p> <p>He said he was keen to move on after the leadership result is announced on 24 September, but said he recognised that winning would not necessarily mean an end to the criticism. \u201cUnfortunately that is not in my hands,\u201d he said. \u201cI hope at the end of this leadership contest everyone will recognise we\u2019ve had the debate. </p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve been nominated by 300-odd constituency Labour parties. There is support here for a different way of doing politics and I hope all my colleagues in parliament will reflect on that and reflect on how we can work together.\u201d</p> <p>Corbyn has spent Tuesday campaigning on transport, meeting commuters at London Bridge station during a protest by unions against the beleaguered Southern rail, followed by campaign rallies in Derby and Matlock. </p> <p>Speaking in Derby, Corbyn he it was the 21st speech of his leadership campaign, which aimed to visit every major city and town in the UK. He renewed his pledge to renationalise the railways, which he said would mean bringing each franchise back into public ownership when it came up for renewal. </p> <p>\u201cThe costs of rail travel will be borne by public as a whole and profits will go to the public,\u201d he said. \u201cProfits from the east coast mainline are now going to Virgin. </p> <p>\u201cThis campaign is about the election of one person to be leader of the party. But put it this way, it\u2019s a campaign about the kind of country we want to live in and the place we want to play in the world. </p> <p>\u201cOur programme is about social justice, opportunities for all and a sustainable economy, but it is also about how we do our politics. Do we allow an elite to decide what the politics should be, what the policies are \u2026 or is it about the participation of the hundreds of thousands who are now part of our party and our movement??\u201d</p> <p>His campaign says passengers could see savings of up to 10%, though critics have said in practice that it would take several years for any savings to trickle down to passengers.</p> <p>Corbyn also announced what his team said was a plan to extend public control over bus networks, allowing local authorities to have franchising power and establish municipal bus companies.</p> <p>His leadership rival Owen Smith\u2019s campaign said on Tuesday that the policies the Corbyn campaign had announced were not new. Rail renationalisation was agreed by the last shadow cabinet, and Smith\u2019s campaign also said the proposals on bus networks had been agreed in 2012 when Maria Eagle was transport secretary.</p> <p>\u201cThere is nothing new in what Jeremy is saying. He is simply rehashing existing Labour party policy,\u201d a spokesman for the Smith campaign said. \u201cOwen has pledged to go further to improve our rail and bus networks by promising a \u00a3200bn \u2018British New Deal\u2019 to invest in things like transport services to help get the country moving again.\u201d</p>",
  "<h2>SQUAD GOALS</h2> <p>Big Cup is back, baby! And what better way to get in the mood for the drama and hype of Europe\u2019s greatest club competition than with an earnest discussion of Joe Hart\u2019s pass-completion statistics? Hart\u2019s surprise exclusion from the Manchester City side to face Sunderland on Saturday was down to an inability with his feet rather than his hands. In the last three seasons, only 49% of his passes have been successful, as compared to 85% of Manuel Neuer\u2019s, a striking discrepancy pointed out by various sports newsreaders with a solemnity previously reserved for the assassination of politicians.</p> <p>Hart is likely to remain on the substitutes\u2019 bench in Romania on Tuesday night, when City play the first leg of their Big Cup qualifier against Steaua Bucharest. Yaya Tour\u00e9 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/aug/15/yaya-toure-manchester-city-squad-left-out-champions-league\">was left out of the entire squad</a>, with suggestions that, at 33, he is happy to do the Bogarde and run down his \u00a311m contract on a quid pro eff all basis. \u201cYaya is training amazing,\u201d said Guardiola, as a nearby polygraph coincidentally exploded, \u201cbut I was not sure he was going to play so I would prefer him to stay in Manchester.

I don\u2019t really play as a No10, more as a free eight, with a lot of movement everywhere. Everyone is starting to understand it. You sometimes could see someone thinking: \u2018Where should I run?\u2019 but for a first match it was better than expected. The intention is to play from the back and then scroll it to me and David [Silva], so we can be five against four.\u201d And with that The Fiver started to weep uncontrollably as it realised the pseuds would soon be earnestly discussing Hart\u2019s scroll-completion ratio.</p> <h2>LIVE ON BIG WEBSITE</h2> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football\">Join Lawrence Ostlere from 7.45pm BST for hot MBM coverage of Steaua Bucharest 1-2 Manchester City</a>.</p> <h2>QUOTE OF THE DAY</h2> <p>\u201cIt is sad that someone can do something like that and ruin an evening.

Of the shows eligible, Mr Swallow\u2019s Houdini is the most giddily enjoyable I\u2019ve seen, a faux-musical about the life of the great escapologist, again ring-led by Mohammed\u2019s camp, chatterbox alter ego, and featuring extraordinary feats of escape alongside the blithering, convention-shredding comedy.<br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2015/feb/03/nick-mohammed-mr-swallow-dracula\">Nick Mohammed: meet the comedian who\u2019s a real pain in the neck</a> </p> </aside>  <p> In short, you get a helluva bang for your buck. It\u2019s a three-man show \u2013 Mr Swallow is backed by usual sidekicks Mr Goldsworth (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2014/aug/21/fringe-comedy-shows-last-minute-fun-edinburgh-festival-2014\">David Elms</a>) and Jonathan (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2015/oct/12/kieran-hodgson-lance-armstrong-comedy-interview\">Kieran Hodgson</a>), decked out in oriental tunics for no discernible reason. It\u2019s Goldsworth\u2019s futile job to keep Mr Swallow\u2019s popcorning mind on track, as he derails the opening number to tell us about a woman he recently met at the circus, gets sidetracked by a chat about the urethra, or steps out of character to marvel at a magic trick he himself has just performed. \u201cOh, piss off! No! No way!\u201d </p> <p>The conjuring here is tossed off for fun. Swallow performs half a dozen tricks almost as an aside while belting out the show\u2019s verbally intricate main number. Given that, you\u2019d forgive a dip in the quality of the comedy \u2013 but there is none. Mohammed and co-stars keep finding new ways to rib theatrical convention: Swallow making shadow hand-puppets in Mr Goldsworth\u2019s spotlight is a choice example.

Before you know it, the lyrics aren\u2019t about Houdini, they\u2019re about characters in the other fictional tier, or they\u2019re musical backchat about the show\u2019s faltering progress.

It was set up by Omar Bakri Muhammad, the \u201cTottenham Ayatollah\u201d, and Choudary has proudly described himself as a student of Bakri Muhammad.</p> <p>Bakri Muhammad set up al-Muhajiroun (\u201cthe emigrants\u201d) after he was fired in 1996 as the leader of the UK branch of Hizb ut-Tahrir (Party of Liberation), which he had turned into Britain\u2019s fastest-growing Muslim group with his anti-Israeli, anti-homosexual, anti-liberal rhetoric. He was ousted when Hizb ut-Tahrir\u2019s Middle Eastern leadership decided he was too extreme.</p> <p>By 2005 at the latest, the authorities in the UK had information showing al-Muhajiroun\u2019s willingness to support jihad, according to documents seen by the Guardian.</p> <p>In a sworn statement, the terrorist-turned-supergrass <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2007/may/01/terrorism.politics\">Mohammed Junaid Babar</a> said Bakri Muhammad had funded jihad and was willing to do so again.</p> <p>Babar attended a terrorist training camp in Pakistan with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2005/jul/14/july7.uksecurity5\">Mohammad Sidique Khan</a>, the ringleader of the London suicide bombings on 7 July 2005.</p> <p>In a statement made after his arrest, Babar described events in 2001-02 as a group of jihadis and associates plotted an attack in Britain: \u201cAround the same time Omar Bakri had given money to [name of suspect] for the jihad.\u201d That money was used to fund those in Afghanistan fighting western forces.</p> <p>Bakri Muhammad also agreed on another occasion to give money for jihad.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7688f54f7b7016b8e06568c26835aabb720fa19f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7688f54f7b7016b8e06568c26835aabb720fa19f/0_99_2048_1228/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Omar Bakri Muhammad in Beirut in 2005\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Omar Bakri Muhammad in Beirut in 2005.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nabil Mounzer/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Babar\u2019s statement emerged during the UK investigation into a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2008/oct/30/uk-security-crime\">plot to bomb targets such as the Bluewater shopping centre</a> in Kent. A number of the plotters had al-Muhajiroun links.</p> <p>Al-Muhajiroun was disbanded in 2004 before it could be legally banned and Bakri Muhammad left Britain. It re-emerged as a new group, frequently changing its name after being re-proscribed, with Choudary in effect its leader, in regular contact with Bakri Muhammad.</p> <p>Choudary courted publicity and controversy, making frequent media appearances, and managed to evade prosecution.</p> <p>In 2015, just before his arrest, Choudary claimed he was merely engaged in a \u201cverbal jihad\u201d. <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/news/recruiting-for-isis-60-minutes-2/\">Questioned by America\u2019s CBS News</a>, Choudary used an argument he had relied on over the years to rebut claims that he was a terrorist menace. He said: \u201cThere was a report out recently which said that I inspired 500 people, in fact, to carry out operations here and abroad. And if that were really the case, don\u2019t you think that I\u2019d be arrested and I\u2019d be sitting in prison?\u201d</p> <p>He was on television so much he even has his <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm2552418/\">own listing</a> on the actor database IMDb.</p> <p>In the Muslim community, several sources said the view on the street was that Choudary was a spy or informant. One figure said: \u201cOther people got banged up and nothing ever happened to this guy.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe is a very clever individual,\u201d said Commander Dean Haydon, the head of counter-terrorism at Scotland Yard, who denied Choudary had been allowed to remain active for the purposes of gathering intelligence, saying police would have leapt at the chance to prosecute: \u201cIf we had the evidence we would have done.\u201d</p> <p>Some took matters into their own hands. There was even a secret British Muslim effort to entice some of his followers away. Some of those who left gave an insight into the style and content of his message.</p> <p>Two sources with knowledge of al-Muhajiroun recruits said Choudary would never, even in private, break the law by directly urging the carrying out of a specific terrorist act. </p> <p>His statements in public enticed those attracted by the idea of violent extremism. Then in private, sermons and lectures pointed them in the direction of violent jihad. He said Islam not only permitted violence but commanded it. With recruits ideologically primed, they were let loose.</p> <p>Again and again, people who joined his groups, attended the lectures and accepted his worldview went on to be involved in terrorism.</p> <p>Perhaps the best known example is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2014/feb/26/lee-rigby-killers-michael-adebolajo-adebowale-whole-life-ruling\">Michael Adebolajo</a>, who in May 2013 led an accomplice in the hacking to death of the soldier Lee Rigby on a London street.

He said Adebolajo received special attention as a new convert: \u201cIn 2004 Muslims were feeling a lot of pressures from new laws and from Iraq.\u201d</p> <p>Adebolajo asked the group when violence could be justified. \u201cHe asked these type of questions, like many others,\u201d said Bakri Muhammad. \u201cHe was asking what to do, he was most likely affected by the situation in Iraq and Afghanistan.\u201d</p> <p>Also tied to Choudary\u2019s extremist groups was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/feb/19/london-teenager-brusthom-ziamani-guilty-of-plotting-to-behead-soldier\">Brusthom Ziamani</a>, who said he was en route to behead a soldier when he was arrested on a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/london\">London</a> street in 2014 carrying a knife and hammer in his bag. Ziamani, 19 when convicted, said he had been inspired by the killers of Rigby, describing one of them as \u201ca legend\u201d.</p> <p>He had been radicalised by members of al-Muhajiroun and the trial judge told the convert he had been \u201cadopted and totally absorbed by a twisted interpretation of the holy Qur\u2019an\u201d.</p> <p>Members of al-Muhajiroun gave him clothes and a place to stay after he was asked to leave home by his parents.

He was also convicted alongside his uncle Shazib Khan, 23, of preparing to go to Syria to join Isis. The judge in their trial said both men had been radicalised by al-Muhajiroun.</p> <p>As well as plots against the UK, members travelled to join Isis in Syria. Siddhartha Dhar, a convert from Hinduism who was close to Choudary, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2014/nov/26/terror-suspect-on-run-siddartha-dhar-taunt-shoddy-uk-security-services-twitter\">went to Syria</a> and produced a recruitment pamphlet for Isis called A Brief Guide to the Islamic State.</p> <p>But away from Britain, Choudary is also tied to the spread of the message of violent jihad.</p> <p>In Belgium, which is coping with the aftermath of fatal terrorist attacks and fears more in future, Choudary helped set up Sharia4Belgium. In 2015 it was declared a terrorist group and 45 of its followers were charged. Thirty-six of them were absent for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/feb/11/leader-of-belgian-islamist-group-sentenced-to-12-years-in-prison\">their trial</a> and were believed to be fighting in Syria or to be dead on the battlefield. All bar one was convicted and Choudary\u2019s response to the jailing of its leader for 15 years was to laud him as a hero.</p> <p>According to Europol, Sharia4Belgium \u201cengaged in organised indoctrination and recruitment of young people to participate in the armed conflict in Syria\u201d.</p> <p>Choudary\u2019s influence in Europe was such that the Dutch intelligence agency AIVD assessed him to be a key influence in the spread of the country\u2019s jihadi movement. A spokesperson for AIVD told the Guardian it still stands by its assessment of Choudary\u2019s central role, set out in a 2014 document: \u201cSince the 1980s the UK has harboured an active Islamist movement propagating an antidemocratic, intolerant and sometimes explicitly violent ideology.</p> <p>\u201cAt its heart is the now banned group Islam4UK, previously known as Al-Muhajiroun, al-Ghurabaa and Muslims Against Crusades. Its most familiar faces are Omar Bakri (currently resident in Lebanon) and Anjem Choudary, who acts as its spokesman. Modelling itself closely on this British movement, Sharia4Belgium was active in Belgium for several years but subsequently disbanded itself in a blaze of publicity.\u201d</p> <p>Not for the first time a European intelligence agency was raising questions about how Britain dealt with a key jihadi player.</p> <p>The case of Choudary has parallels with that of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/may/20/abu-hamza-arrest-take-so-long-us-terrorism-charges\">Abu Hamza</a>. In this cleric\u2019s case, France led the incredulity at Britain\u2019s failure to stop his activities, with Hamza and the Finsbury Park mosque in north London he controlled being linked to numerous plots. Like Hamza, Choudary operated for years in plain sight, with some dismissing him as a clown.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b32f620503c9fad4f4bffe206e91e98a0a873d31\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b32f620503c9fad4f4bffe206e91e98a0a873d31/0_38_2048_1229/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Abu Hamza addressing a rally in Trafalgar Square, London\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Abu Hamza addressing a rally in Trafalgar Square, London, in 2002.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ian Waldie/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The leftwing, anti-extremist group Hope Not Hate, which usually targets rightwing fascists, investigated Choudary and his groups because of the damage they inflicted in communities.</p> <p>Nick Lowles, of Hope Not Hate, said: \u201cAlthough he was treated as a somewhat clown-like, go-to figure for the press as a rent-a-quote extremist, he clearly promoted the disgusting and divisive ideals of Islamic State, while dozens of his supporters have been connected to terrorist plots, violence or heading overseas to fight in Syria, Iraq and other conflicts.\u201d</p> <p>In a report on Choudary called Cheerleading for Islamic State, Hope Not Hate said: \u201cWhile Syria and the Islamic State has been the most recent target for [al-Muhajiroun] activists, the organisation and its network has a long history of being a conduit through which jihadists have been funnelled to various war zones.\u201d</p> <p>Lowles added: \u201cIn the six months following the creation of Islamic State, Choudary was its biggest cheerleader in the English-speaking world and the network he helped create became the largest recruiter for IS in Europe.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Many Muslims have long been puzzled why this man was regularly approached by the media to give outrageous statements</p> <footer> <cite>Miqdaad Versi, Muslim Council of Great Britain</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>One expert in counter-radicalisation said Choudary was useful for Isis in the early days, when it was looking to gain traction in the UK. But the likes of him are now needed barely at all because Isis\u2019s reputation in jihadi circles and its online machine has grown so much. \u201cThey don\u2019t need a middle man,\u201d said the expert, who has knowledge of cases where those who attended Choudary\u2019s lectures now bitterly resent ever becoming involved with him.</p> <p>Scotland Yard\u2019s Haydon said of al-Muhajiroun: \u201cIt has been a force for the radicalisation and recruitment of both extremists and terrorists here in the UK.\u201d</p> <p>The police chief added that Choudary was a \u201ckey individual in the UK\u201d, enticing people to join Isis in Syria by posting vast amounts of material online that radicalised them.</p> <p>British Muslims had complained about the media attention paid to Choudary, the impression given to audiences that he was representative of British Islamic thought.</p> <p>Miqdaad Versi, of the Muslim Council of Britain, said on Tuesday: \u201cMr Anjem Choudary has long been condemned by Muslim organisations and Muslims across the country, who consider him and his support for Daesh [Isis] to be despicable and contrary to the values of Islam and our nation. Many Muslims have long been puzzled why this man was regularly approached by the media to give outrageous statements that inflamed Islamophobia. We hope the judgment serves as a lesson for anyone who follows this path of advocating hate and division.\u201d</p> <p>His case, and the brazen nature of it, raises issues about the UK\u2019s terrorism laws: do we need yet more, or to learn to better use the plethora we have already?</p> <p>During his trial Choudary seemed relaxed, chatting to one journalist as if at a garden party: \u201cHow long have we known each other? Twenty years?\u201d, with a shy and uncertain smile coming across his face.</p> <p>\u201cHe was always a bit loopy,\u201d says one long-term Muslim acquaintance of Choudary. But he got more extreme in the last 15 years: \u201cHe fell off the edge and got worse and worse.\u201d</p> <p>It has been quite a journey for the son of a market trader who grew up in south-east London and went to Southampton University, where he was nicknamed \u201cAndy\u201d and knocked back pints in the student bar. He gained a law degree and worked at the Commission for Racial Equality for a while but left as he became increasingly consumed by Islamism.</p> <p>The married father-of-four spent his time propagating violent extremism without any income other than state welfare payments.<br></p> <p>As Choudary prepares for a long jail sentence there is a bitter reality for those trying to combat violent jihad. In his own malevolent terms, the number of people Choudary helped recruit to terrorism and the fact he did it under their noses represents a victory for his cause, and an added challenge to those whose values oppose it.</p>",
  "<p>Pop history is full of hugely influential acts who never received the success or credit they deserved. But it is hard to think of many who have been as influential as A Certain Ratio and remained almost completely unknown to the general public.</p> <p>ACR were one of the first artists on Factory Records, were responsible for the label\u2019s first single-artist release (the All Night Party single in May 1979) and were pioneers of what became known as \u201cpunk funk\u201d. Their impact now stretches from Talking Heads to Happy Mondays, from the Rapture to the Invisible to the Red Hot Chili Peppers. The band are legends in Manchester, but recognition has come more from fellow musicians, Factory obsessives and dancefloor-friendly indie hipsters than from the man in the street.</p> <p>Superfan James Murphy would give potential LCD Soundsystem recruits a tape including their frenetic early track <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnqN-rGM3J8\">Do the Du</a> as an example of the jerkily funky sound he wanted. And DJ Andrew Weatherall was such an ACR nut that for a while in the 1980s he donned the band\u2019s trademark \u201cdesert rats\u201d style \u2013 although <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/feb/25/andrew-weatherall-interview-dj-disco-maverick\">he admitted to the Guardian recently</a> that a \u201cHitler Youth haircut, German army vest and big shorts\u201d meant that while \u201cI thought I looked like I was in A Certain Ratio, actually I looked like Don Estelle in It Ain\u2019t Half Hot Mum.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-vgmjzjkLc\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"345\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/H-vgmjzjkLc?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-vgmjzjkLc\">Watch Certain Ratio\u2019s Shack Up</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>Like funky Forrest Gumps, ACR seem to have been present at scores of pivotal moments of pop history. According to frontman Jeremy Kerr, when they supported Talking Heads in the late 70s, David Byrne watched them every night, captivated by their collision of punk, industrial and funk, and curious about what they\u2019d been listening to. \u201cHe\u2019d never heard of George Clinton, which seems comical now,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2011/jul/21/catalyst-bands-ruthless-rap-assassins\">Kerr told me in 2011</a>. \u201cBut they were coming from a punk background. Their next album was funky.\u201d To my ears at least, Reni\u2019s revolving snare pattern on the second half of the Stone Roses\u2019 <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRwR7avc5Oc\">I Am the Resurrection</a> sounds eerily similar to that on <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isMh1itIiuU\">ACR\u2019s Winter Hill</a>, released eight years earlier.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>If we\u2019d had a hit, people would have known us. Now, people still ask, \u2018Who are they? What are they?\u2019</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The band even had an unlikely hand in a major commercial pop phenomenon. When Sire Records\u2019 Seymour Stein was interested in signing the young Madonna, she supported ACR in New York so he could watch her perform. Ian Curtis of Joy Division was a fan \u2013 ACR\u2019s original frontman, Simon Topping, even stood in for him at <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.joydiv.org/c080480.htm\">a turbulent Joy Division gig in Bury</a> \u2013 and ACR are immortalised in the film 24 Hour Party People as having the same energy as their illustrious labelmates, \u201cbut better clothes\u201d. Kerr <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuywMumktgA\">rescued the slap bass</a> from the tyranny of Level 42.</p> <p>Despite their influence, they have never had so much as a sniff of a hit. The closest they have come to widespread popularity was when their 1980 single Shack Up (a cover of <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sh9ugRFvJkg\">an obscure 1975 cut by Banbarra</a>) became a dancefloor smash in New York clubs. Not that the lack of mainstream success bothers the band. As Kerr told me in 2010: \u201cIf we\u2019d had a hit, people would have known us. Now, people still ask, \u2018Who are they?

The old adage about ecstasy \u2013 that it \u201ctaught white kids to dance\u201d \u2013 was also true of Johnson and ACR.</p> <p>Along the way, there have been lineup changes, but the core of the band has been rock solid since 1979: bassist/singer Kerr, drumming maestro Johnson and guitarist Martin Moscrop.</p> <p>I haven\u2019t liked all of their records (although I can\u2019t think of any I\u2019ve actually hated) but I absolutely love most of them, from All Night Party through to their last album, 2008\u2019s Mind Made Up, right down to their stunning sleeves.

When first responders arrived, they transported Jabara, 37, to a nearby hospital where he died from his wounds, police said.</p> <p>As police were obtaining a search warrant for Majors\u2019 home, he was discovered hiding behind a tree at a nearby library. It\u2019s unclear how long he was behind the tree. Police arrested Majors, but before he could be interviewed, \u201che became ill and had to be transported to the hospital\u201d, police said. Officers recovered a single handgun, and no other suspects are being sought.</p> <p>A motive is unclear, police said on Saturday, as \u201cwe have not been able to talk to Majors\u201d.</p> <p>Court records and interviews reveal a contentious history between the family and Majors.</p> <p>Since the beginning of 2015, police have responded to over 50 calls to Majors\u2019 residence, but Walker said on Monday that he couldn\u2019t confirm what they were about or in reference to. \u201cSome are alarm calls and report calls,\u201d he said. In the same timeframe, police received 20 calls from Jabara\u2019s residence, he added, and \u201cseveral of those refer to Majors\u201d.</p> <p>In the hit-and-run case, prosecutors disclosed that Tulsa police were aware of ongoing \u201cneighborly disturbances\u201d between Majors and the family. One officer testified he had been dispatched to the Jabara household three times in one day following complaints about Majors, according to court records.</p> <p>On the date Majors allegedly struck Jabara\u2019s mother, an officer said there was a dispute over a vehicle parked the wrong way in the street, records indicate.</p> <p>\u201cThe defendant discussed the disputes going on between the two households, including telling [the officer] that the victim and her family were \u201cfilthy Lebanese\u201d and that \u201cthey throw gay people off the roof\u201d, according to a court filing.</p> <p>A message was left for an attorney representing Jabara\u2019s mother.</p> <p>Majors himself sought a protection order against Jabara, claiming he trespassed and vandalized his home in December 2014. Majors said that Jabara knocked on his door at \u201call hours, emailed him threats and used his address to order computer products\u201d, according to the petition for a protection order.</p> <p>A judge the following month ruled that Jabara had to remain 30 feet from Majors \u201cat all times\u201d and refrain from having any contact with him whatsoever. Majors later sued Jabara for $1,500 related to damage in his kitchen. Jabara wasn\u2019t criminally charged in connection with the incident, court records indicate.</p> <p>In the Facebook post, Williams described Jabara as a loving sibling with quick wit.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll miss his jokes (I stole all my jokes from him!),\u201d she said, \u201chis love for all things electronic, his love for my mom and dad, Rami, and this tenderness toward his nieces.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThis angel will be missed,\u201d she continued. \u201cLove you, Khalid.\u201d</p> <ul> <li>This article was amended on 16 August 2016.

They will be sentenced on 6 September at the Old Bailey.</p> <p>Commander Dean Haydon, head of the Metropolitan police\u2019s counter-terrorism command, said: \u201cThese men have stayed just within the law for many years, but there is no one within the counter-terrorism world that has any doubts of the influence that they have had, the hate they have spread and the people that they have encouraged to join terrorist organisations.</p> <p>\u201cOver and over again we have seen people on trial for the most serious offences who have attended lectures or speeches given by these men. The oath of allegiance was a turning point for the police \u2013 at last we had the evidence that they had stepped over the line and we could prove they supported Isis.\u201d</p> <p>Haydon said 20 years\u2019 worth of material was considered in the investigation, with 333 electronic devices containing 12.1 terabytes of storage data assessed.</p> <p>It can now also be revealed that Choudary was encouraged to support Isis by a notorious British Isis fighter who fled to Syria while on police bail.</p> <p>The court heard that shortly after Isis was proscribed as a terror group Choudary was in contact with an individual named as Subject A. It can now be revealed Subject A was Siddartha Dhar \u2013 known on social media as Abu Rumaysah \u2013 who was arrested alongside Choudary before he fled to Syria to fight with Isis while on police bail.</p> <p>Dhar encouraged Choudary to express support for Isis on social media. Following on from Dhar\u2019s encouragement, both defendants made their position on the newly declared caliphate clear in the \u201coath of allegiance\u201d.</p> <p>Prosecutor Richard Whittam QC said: \u201cThe prosecution case is that whichever name is used, the evidence is quite clear: when these defendants were inviting support for an Islamic state or caliphate they were referring to the one <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jun/30/isis-announces-islamic-caliphate-iraq-syria\">declared in Syria</a> and its environs by Ibrahim [Abu Bakr] al-Baghdadi at the end of June 2014.</p> <p>\u201cTerrorist organisations thrive and grow because people support them and that is what this case is about. Do not confuse that with the right of people to follow the religion of their choice or to proclaim support for a caliphate.\u201d</p> <p>Choudary, who has a long history with groups involved in radical Islamist demonstrations, such as the now-banned al-Muhajiroun and Islam4UK, denied he was inviting support for Isis and claimed to be a \u201clecturer in sharia law\u201d giving \u201cthe Islamic perspective\u201d.</p> <p>He began studying sharia law under Syrian-born Bakri Muhammad, a Salafi Islamist militant leader who formed al-Muhajiroun with the aim of promoting sharia in the 1990s, the court heard.<br></p> <p>Bakri Muhammad fled to Lebanon in 2005, where he was joined by Choudary for about 10 weeks.

And to obey them obviously means they must be established,\u201d Choudary said. </p> <p>He added: \u201cI would just say, uh you know, for people who want to live under sharia law, obviously this is a great thing, and for those people who say we are promoting Isis, they are not even called Isis any more. Rather, you have an Islamic state where you have millions of people who are governed by the sharia law and I don\u2019t think it is against the law to go and live there and want to abide by sharia law.\u201d<br></p> <p>The prosecution also played an older lecture given by Choudary in March 2013, which did not form part of the charge but was provided to the jury for background.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We don't have any borders \u2026 it is about time we resumed conquering for the sake of Allah</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>In the lecture, titled Duties of the Khilafah State, Choudary makes clear his desire for the establishment of a caliphate as well as his support for the military action of Islamic State.<br></p> <p>He said: \u201cThat is why the kuffar [non-believers] are worried, my dear Muslims. When the Muslims of the subcontinent gather together. When the Taliban <em>inshallah </em>[God willing]<em> </em>and the mujahideen take Afghanistan and then declare jihad against the <em>mourtad</em> of Zardini and his army of <em>tawaghit</em>, and when they annex and take India and they take Bangladesh and they take Indonesia, you have over a billion Muslims in the area.</p> <p>\u201cWe don\u2019t have any borders, my dear Muslims. It is about time we resumed conquering for the sake of Allah.</p> <p>\u201cNext time when your child is at school and the teacher says \u2018what do you want when you grow up, what is your ambition?\u2019, they should say to dominate the whole world by Islam, including Britain, that is my ambition.\u201d</p> <p>The prosecution told the court that the defendants were \u201cacutely aware\u201d of the potential criminal implications of being overt in their support for Isis.</p> <p>Whittam told the court: \u201cThe prosecution alleges that this led to great care in the way in which the defendants expressed themselves publicly, particularly after Isil was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2014/jun/16/isis-syrian-terrorist-groups-banned-britain-iraq\">proscribed as a terrorist organisation</a> by the home secretary.\u201d<br></p> <p>Choudary also took to social media to express support for Isis, the court heard. In late July 2014, he engaged in a series of messages with others as to the authority for the declaration of Eid (the Islamic festival) coming from \u201cthe office of the Islamic State\u201d. </p> <p>Born in north London, he initially studied medicine at Barts medical school before changing courses and enrolling at Guildford College of Law. He opened his own solicitor\u2019s practice in his late 20s but told the court that by that point he had become religious and his beliefs did not sit easily with certain aspects of the law.</p> <p>Sue Hemming, Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) head of counter terrorism, said: \u201cThese two men knowingly sought to legitimise a terrorist organisation and encouraged others to support it. They used the power of social media to attempt to influence those who are susceptible to these types of messages, which might include the young or vulnerable.</p> <p>\u201cBoth men were fully aware that Daesh is a proscribed terrorist group, the brutal activities they are carrying out and that what they were doing was illegal. Terrorism can have no place in our society and those that encourage others to join such organisations will be prosecuted.\u201d</p> <p>British Muslims had complained about the media attention paid to Choudary and the impression sometimes given to audiences that he was representative of British Islamic thought.</p> <p>Miqdaad Versi, of the Muslim Council of Britain, told the Guardian: \u201cMr Anjem Choudary has long been condemned by Muslim organisations and Muslims across the country, who consider him and his support for Daesh [Isis] to be despicable and contrary to the values of Islam and our nation. </p> <p>\u201cMany Muslims have long been puzzled why this man was regularly approached by the media to give outrageous statements that inflamed Islamophobia. We hope the judgment serves as a lesson for anyone who follows this path of advocating hate and division.\u201d</p>",

A source who worked with him in Ukraine said on Tuesday: \u201cIf there was cash I would have known about it and seen it. I was going in and out of the Party of Regions HQ every day.\u201d </p> <p>Even before the latest allegations, Trump\u2019s links to Russia have raised eyebrows: Manafort\u2019s candidate has expressed admiration for Putin, encouraged Russia to hack Hillary Clinton\u2019s emails, and appeared unaware that Russian troops had seized the Ukrainian peninsula of Crimea. <br></p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>If he can make Yanukovych president, I\u2019m sure he can do it with Trump</p> <footer> <cite>Oleg Voloshin</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Meanwhile, the Trump campaign was reportedly instrumental in rewriting the new Republican platform to remove calls for the donation of weapons to Ukraine to fight Russian and rebel forces.</p> <p>It remains unclear how much of this was down to Manafort. What is indisputable is that at the same time as he was advising Yanukovych, Manafort was also building personal business links with some of the most powerful figures in the post-Soviet world.<br></p> <p>Before his arrival in Kiev, Manafort had long <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/apr/27/paul-manafort-donald-trump-campaign-past-clients\">specialised in taking on unsavoury clients</a>, such as Ferdinand Marcos, the Filipino dictator, and Mobutu Sese Seko of Zaire, and subtly retooling their public reputations. <br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"574ff8bb5ff116f5c7507095fc82041c94c1b5df\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/574ff8bb5ff116f5c7507095fc82041c94c1b5df/0_84_4199_2520/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Trump\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Donald Trump has expressed admiration for Putin and encouraged Russia to hack Hillary Clinton\u2019s emails.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jeff Swensen/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>He was recruited to work in Ukraine in the summer of 2005 by the oligarch Rinat Akhmetov \u2013 the main financial backer of Yanukovych\u2019s Party of Regions. </p> <p>That autumn, Manafort and his team \u2013 including longtime aide Rick Gates, another future Trump hire \u2013 began work for the Party of Regions. They rented an anonymous office at number 4 Sophia Street in Kiev, opposite the stop for the 16 and 18 trolley buses. Typically, its white blinds were drawn.</p> <p>The Americans kept a low profile, but Manafort\u2019s efforts didn\u2019t go entirely unnoticed. In a 2006 cable to the state department in Washington, US diplomats reported that the Party of Regions had undergone a mysterious transformation. \u201cLong a haven for Donetsk-based mobsters and oligarchs it is in the midst of an \u2018extreme makeover\u2019,\u201d they observed.</p> <p>The party had enlisted \u201chelp and advice from veteran K street political tacticians\u201d, the diplomats said, referring to Washington DC\u2019s lobbying district. Manafort\u2019s firm \u2013 Davis, Manafort &amp; Freedman \u2013 was busy \u201cnipping and tucking\u201d. Its goal was to rid the party of its gangster image and to change it into a \u201clegitimate political force\u201d.</p> <p>I met Manafort in September 2007, on the eve of the Ostroh rally. This was just before the parliamentary elections, and Yanukovych was frantically touring the regions on a campaign helicopter. </p> <p>Close up, Manafort looked every inch the classic Washington lobbyist. He wore an expensive suit and tie and exuded seriousness. He also bore a faint physical resemblance to his client \u2013 even their hairstyles were similar. (Manafort, I was told later, had instructed Yanukovych to blow-dry his hair. Manafort\u2019s camp denies this.)</p> <p>The American had an interesting story to tell \u2013 one which may sound familiar to observers of Donald Trump\u2019s campaign \u2013 of how his candidate had been almost wilfully misunderstood by the west, especially by its media.<br></p> <p>The new Yanukovych was nothing like the old one, Manafort suggested. He had absorbed the lessons of his previous defeats, was studying English \u2013 and was even playing tennis with the US ambassador.</p> <p>\u201cPeople are still looking at the political system in this country through the prism of 2004,\u201d Manafort told me. \u201cThat\u2019s not at all the situation here.\u201d <br></p> <p>Yanukovych was no puppet of Putin, Manafort said; he wanted a pragmatic foreign policy \u2013 good relations with Russia and the EU. </p> <p>\u201cAs a person, he [Yanukovych] is growing,\u201d Manafort assured me. \u201cI think the time out of power helped him.\u201d</p> <p>Manafort introduced professional techniques. He gathered polling data, worked on messaging and distributed talking points. His efforts were at least partially successful: Yanukovych\u2019s Party of Regions won the 2007 parliamentary elections, and in 2010 Yanukovych beat his rival Yulia Tymoshenko in a presidential runoff. Within a few months, it had become clear that he was hellbent on reversing the modest democratic gains of the Orange Revolution. </p> <p>Yanukovych moved quickly to consolidate all instruments of power: the courts, parliament, the prosecutor\u2019s office, <a href=\"https://www.opendemocracy.net/od-russia/sergii-leshchenko/two-worlds-of-viktor-yanukovych%E2%80%99s-ukraine\">the media and TV</a>. Tymoshenko was charged with corruption and jailed; Yankovych repeatedly shrugged off western calls for her release. </p> <p>In late 2013, Yanukovych was due to sign an association agreement with the European Union, but at the last minute he dumped the plan and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/dec/17/ukraine-russia-leaders-talks-kremlin-loan-deal\">instead accepted a $15bn Kremlin bailout</a>. </p> <p>Pro-EU demonstrators flooded the Maidan, Kiev\u2019s main square, and protests turned violent after a brutal crackdown by security forces.</p> <p>In February 2014, riot police shot dead 100 people in downtown Kiev.

Earlier this month, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/10/russia-accuses-ukraine-of-armed-crimea-incursion\">Russia claimed Ukrainian agents had attacked Crimea</a>, further fueling tensions in the region.<br></p> <p>Those who worked with Manafort say that he cannot be blamed for the Ukrainian disaster. Oleg Voloshin, a former aide to Kostyantyn Gryshchenko, Yanukovych\u2019s 2010-12 foreign minister who now works as a political consultant, says Manafort urged Yanukovych to press ahead with the EU integration agenda.</p> <p>Voloshin still has ties with the ex-Party of Regions, which Manafort rebranded in 2014 as the Opposition Bloc. (Manafort\u2019s consultancy in Ukraine continued until at least parliamentary elections in 2014.)</p> <p>He suggests that Yanukovych \u201clistened to what Paul said\u201d between 2007-2010, but then, once he became president, stopped listening \u2013 with catastrophic results.</p> <p>Manafort\u2019s advice was always non-ideological, Voloshin recalls. He would calmly explain: \u201cThese people won\u2019t vote for you, don\u2019t bother with them,\u201d and then suggest he \u201cpromote this message, promote that message\u201d. \u201cIt was a very American approach. Do this, do that.\u201d And, crucially: \u201cHe was the person dragging Yanukovych to the west.\u201d<br></p> <p>According to Voloshin, Manafort was an advocate of US interests and promoted American oil companies such as Chevron \u2013 so much so that the joke inside the Party of Regions was that Manafort was actually from the CIA. \u201cYou can blame him for whatever. The only thing you can\u2019t blame him for is lack of will in lobbying for American interests in Ukraine in the commercial sphere.\u201d</p> <p>Voloshin insists that it was Manafort who persuaded Yanukovych to press ahead with the EU integration agenda, arguing that it would counter Yanukovych\u2019s sagging ratings. Manafort also strongly objected to Tymoshenko\u2019s imprisonment, telling Yanukovych bluntly: \u201cYou are going to have very bad times with the west.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not Paul\u2019s fault that Yanukovych didn\u2019t listen to him. If it weren\u2019t for Paul, Ukraine would have gone under Russia much earlier,\u201d Voloshin claims. </p> <p>During the period that he was advising Yanukovych, Manafort\u2019s interests in the post-Soviet world were not restricted to politics.<br></p> <p>In 2007, he set up a private equity firm called Pericles Emerging Partners LP.<br></p> <p>Based offshore in the Caymans, the firm had three American partners \u2013 Manafort, Rick Gates and Rick Davis. Davis had cofounded Davis Manafort, Manfort\u2019s lobbying company in Delaware. The new firm\u2019s aim was to make investments in the Ukrainian cities of Kiev, Odessa and Mariupol. It would acquire small companies, consolidate them into larger national enterprises, then sell them on.</p> <p>One of those tempted by this prospectus was the Russian oligarch Oleg Deripaska, an aluminum baron and close friend of Putin, who stumped up almost $19m. Gates, Manafort\u2019s right-hand man, sealed the agreement in trips to Moscow.</p> <p>What happened next was strange indeed. Only one investment by Pericles was ever made, in a Ukrainian telecoms company called Black Sea Cable. According to court documents, <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2016-07-20/trump-s-manager-is-a-master-of-post-soviet-business\">the cash was funnelled into various offshore companies</a>, including one called CardMan ImpEx Corp, registered in the tax haven of the British Virgin Islands. The trail wound through other opaque shell firms, including Cascado AG, set up by the Panamanian law firm Mossack Fonseca.</p> <p>A search of the Panama Papers leak gives a few details. Cascado has two Latvian directors, <a href=\"https://www.icij.org/offshore/faux-corporate-directors-stand-fraudsters-despots-and-spies\">Erik Vanagels and Stan Gorin</a>. In reality, they are mere nominees. The pair have been <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2016-07-20/trump-s-manager-is-a-master-of-post-soviet-business\">linked on paper to a network of offshore companies and multimillion-dollar scams involving Ukrainian state assets</a>.<br></p> <p>When the global financial crisis hit in 2008, Deripaska wanted out \u2013 and his cash back. In 2011, the Americans emailed to say that it was proving tricky to sell Deripaska\u2019s stake because of \u201cmarket conditions\u201d. Further emails went unanswered.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6888bef114164dde81ae3754fac68b6d909db459\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6888bef114164dde81ae3754fac68b6d909db459/0_98_3469_2082/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Yulia Tymoshenko\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The former Ukrainian prime minister Yulia Tymoshenko alleged that Manafort \u2018played a key role in [a] conspiracy and racketeering enterprise\u2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Genya Savilov/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cIt appears that Paul Manafort and Rick Gates have <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/in-business-as-in-politics-trump-adviser-no-stranger-to-controversial-figures/2016/04/26/970db232-08c7-11e6-b283-e79d81c63c1b_story.html\">simply disappeared</a>,\u201d <a href=\"https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/2814130/Pericles-Winding-Up-Petition.pdf\">Deripaska\u2019s frustrated lawyers wrote</a>, in a 2014 petition to have Manafort\u2019s firm wound up.</p> <p>It\u2019s unclear if Deripaska ever got his money. Either way, the episode illustrates Manafort\u2019s personal links to figures close to Putin. </p> <p>Later, Manafort introduced Deripaska to Senator John McCain, when the oligarch was having problems travelling to the US. (In 2006, the US had revoked Deripaska\u2019s visa, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/oct/31/oleg-deripaska-us-visa-rusal\">citing alleged \u201ccriminal associations\u201d</a>. Deripaska denies the allegation, and his visa was subsequently reinstated.)</p> <p>This wasn\u2019t the only embarrassing legal scrape arising from Manafort\u2019s capitalist adventures. In November 2011, Tymoshenko unsuccessfully sued him and several of her political opponents in the district court in New York. <a href=\"http://freebeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/manafort-complaint-2.pdf\">Her lengthy writ</a> alleged that Manafort \u201cplayed a key role in [a] conspiracy and racketeering enterprise\u201d to launder cash for Yanukovych\u2019s oligarch friends and invest it in New York real estate.</p> <p>In particular, she pointed the finger at Dmitry Firtash, a Ukrainian businessman whose generous contributions helped Yanukovych. Firtash is a shareholder and public face for RosUkrEnergo, an intermediary company co-owned by Gazprom, which imports gas from Russia and resells it to Ukraine. Tymoshenko tried unsuccessfully to get rid of it. </p> <p>The RusUkrEnergo scheme was a mechanism for corruption, she alleged in legal filings. Its real owner, she claimed, was Semyon Mogilevich, a Ukrainian-Russian mobster, and one of the FBI\u2019s top fugitives. Firtash denies this.</p> <p>According to her writ, Firtash and his companies and associates were able to skim billions of dollars from gas transactions. The cash was laundered \u201cthrough a labyrinth of shell companies\u201d. It was then returned to Ukraine, with the money used to bribe Ukrainian officials. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Manafort sells the unsellable product.

Manafort\u2019s plan was to buy the site of the demolished Drake Hotel in Manhattan and to redevelop it at a cost of almost $900m. <a href=\"http://freebeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/manafort-complaint-2.pdf\">Firtash transferred at least $25m to the project</a>.

He expanded the World Cup finals from a 16-nation to 24-nation and then 32-nation competition, invited almost all the countries in the world to join Fifa, and offered them increased involvement in it. By the time he left office in 1998, the organisation had more members than the UN.</p> <p>He was the first sports administrator to pursue global sponsors, such as Adidas and Coca-Cola, and gain total control of television rights and advertising, through his links with the now discredited and defunct sports marketing company ISL. The revolutionary lobbying and business techniques he used to win votes and contracts are now employed routinely.</p> <p>And yet, to his many critics, Havelange\u2019s zeal for commercialising football resulted in it losing its soul. There was rarely any evidence of his love for the game \u2013 the players, countries and hundreds of millions of fans to whom the game brings such joy seemed but parts of his money-spinning masterplan. Worse still, his administrative era was severely tainted by allegations of bribery and corruption, which intensified under the man he pushed forward to be his anointed successor, Sepp Blatter.</p> <p>Havelange was born in Rio de Janeiro to Belgian parents. His father was an arms trader who sent his son to school in France, and the family spoke French at home. Havelange played football as a youth but it was swimming at which he excelled, and he represented Brazil at the Berlin Olympics in 1936 (the year in which he also earned a law degree). He won a bronze medal for water polo at the Pan American Games in 1951, and represented Brazil in the sport at the Helsinki Olympics in 1952.</p> <p>He made his fortune building up Cometa, a transport businesses, but it was as a sports administrator that Havelange made his name. He led the Brazilian delegation to the Melbourne Olympics in 1956 and became a member of the International Olympic Committee (IOC) in 1963. In 1958 he was appointed head of the CBD, the Brazilian Sports Confederation, which oversaw all the nation\u2019s sports.</p> <p>The appointment was made six months before Brazil won their first World Cup, in Sweden, and coincided with a golden era of Brazilian football as they went on to win the tournament again in Chile in 1962 and Mexico in 1970. The 1958 and 1970 teams included a galaxy of stars, among them Pel\u00e9, who would become an important figure in Havelange\u2019s quest for power.</p> <p>His role in funding and organising Brazil\u2019s World Cup victories was important, if typically autocratic. In 1958 he included a psychologist in the party (fearing some players were still affected by the trauma of 1950, when Brazil lost in the final at home in Rio, in front of 200,000 people), and wanted to impose <em>concentra\u00e7\u00e3o total </em>on the squad, effectively round-the-clock supervision, believing that football was too important to be left to the footballers.</p> <p>By the late 1960s Brazil was entering the most brutal phase of a 20-year military dictatorship and Havelange appeased the generals by sacking the coach, Jo\u00e3o Saldanha, a member of the Brazilian Communist party, in 1969. He also instigated a three-month pre-tournament training camp for the squad. They won the 1970 World Cup playing some of the best football ever seen, but they arrived in Mexico wearing dark green, military-style suits.</p> <p>In 1969, with an eye on the Fifa votes of African football federations, he organised a tour of the continent for Pel\u00e9\u2019s club, Santos. It was Havelange who circulated the story that the opposing sides in the Biafran civil war in Nigeria declared a two-day truce so they could watch Pel\u00e9 play. Years later, Pel\u00e9 claimed the story was exaggerated. There was the chance for more lobbying in 1972 when Havelange invited 20 countries to Brazil, all expenses paid, to play in an unrecognised football tournament, the Brazil Independence Cup.</p> <p>By the time of the 1974 election for Fifa president, Havelange had spent millions touring the world lobbying for votes, often accompanied by Pel\u00e9. He reckoned he had visited 86 countries in 10 weeks in the runup to the election.</p> <p>His strategy was to attack the European dominance of Fifa while promising developing countries a greater role, money for their football infrastructure and an expanded World Cup. He paid for many poorer African delegates, who otherwise rarely bothered to turn up at such meetings, to attend for the vote. Despite the enormous global success of the 1970 World Cup, broadcast for the first time in colour, the incumbent Fifa president, Sir Stanley Rous, was hanging on to amateur traditions and supported apartheid in South African sport. He was an easy opponent for Havelange to outmanoeuvre.</p> <p>According to Patrick Nally, a pioneer of modern sports marketing who played a key role in the victory, interviewed by the journalist Andrew Jennings for Dishonored Games (1992): \u201cHavelange had seen the future \u2026 He knew that if he became the president of the only federation already running its own high-profile world championship, then he would enjoy huge economic power.\u201d</p> <p>Havelange had relatively little influence on his first World Cup as Fifa president, held in Argentina, then ruled by a military junta. He let the generals and the head of the Argentinian organising committee, Vice-Admiral Carlos Lacoste, run it their way. In the semi-final stage, Argentina beat Peru 6-0, one of the most controversial results in the history of the tournament.</p> <p>While that match was in progress, a bomb exploded at the home of the Argentinian finance secretary, Juan Alemann, who had criticised the organising committee for wasting millions of dollars on the World Cup. Alemann believed Lacoste had masterminded the operation. Two years later, Havelange appointed Lacoste a Fifa vice-president. When democratic rule was restored to Argentina in 1983, Lacoste was investigated for corruption.</p> <p>Havelange\u2019s expansion of the World Cup began at the 1982 tournament in Spain, when the number of teams increased from 16 to 24. The following World Cup was scheduled to be held in Colombia, but when the country pulled out in financial difficulties, the US, Canada and Mexico put themselves forward to host it. In a show of strength that typified Havelange\u2019s rule, every member of the Fifa executive committee voted with him in support of Mexico.</p> <p>Mexico 1986 set a template for future World Cups \u2013 and was soon copied by other global sports federations. Havelange backed Mexico\u2019s bid because of his close relationship with <a href=\"http://www.fifa.com/news/y=1997/m=1/news=fifa-senior-vice-president-guillermo-canedo-has-died-70175.html\">Guillermo Ca\u00f1edo</a>, a Fifa vice-president and Mexican media baron who brokered a lucrative global TV deal with ISL.</p> <p>The founder of ISL was the German businessman Horst Dassler, former boss of Adidas, who, together with Havelange and the IOC chairman <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2010/apr/21/juan-antonio-samaranch-obituary\">Juan Antonio Samaranch</a>, were the most senior members of \u201cthe club\u201d, an exclusive group of sports administrators and marketing men who controlled a large proportion of international sport. It was a cosy relationship, with the world\u2019s two most powerful sporting bodies and the company that provided the lion\u2019s share of their income all based in Switzerland.</p> <p>ISL bought the rights to the World Cup for enormous sums, peaking in 1996 at the \u00a31.45bn combined bid for rights to the 2002 and 2006 finals. The company folded in 2001, leaving debts of \u00a3153m and a trail of corruption that led to Fifa\u2019s door. A Swiss court investigating the collapse, and the whereabouts of millions of missing dollars, heard evidence from a legal representative of Christoph Malms, a former ISL chief executive, that \u201cthe company became a private source of money for Fifa, virtually their private bank\u201d.</p> <p>After two decades, Havelange\u2019s Napoleonic rule began to stretch the patience of even loyal Fifa executives. He developed the habit of closing executive meetings by simply leaving the room and, in one famous case, postponing a discussion on Fifa appointments by handing out his own list of new committee members, then declaring the list passed without a vote.</p> <p>He banned Pel\u00e9 from attending the draw for the 1994 World Cup in Las Vegas after a feud involving Ricardo Teixeira, Havelange\u2019s then son-in-law and president of the Brazilian Football Confederation. This behaviour towards Pel\u00e9 would have raised eyebrows anywhere in the world. In the US, where he was the only soccer player known to many Americans, it was reckless.</p> <p>Havelange survived one more term as president, secured after further intensive lobbying and a promise to expand the World Cup from 24 to 32 teams for the 1998 tournament. Before resigning in 1998, he helped his righthand man, Blatter, to win the vote to succeed him, over the Uefa president, Lennart Johansson.</p> <p>In 2011, Jennings told a Brazilian senate investigation that Havelange had received bribes totalling around $50m from ISL. Later that year the IOC ethics committee announced that it would investigate claims that he had received bribes of $1m. Soon afterwards, he resigned from the IOC for health reasons.</p> <p>In April 2013 he resigned as honorary president of Fifa, again citing health reasons. Jennings led a BBC team for a Panorama programme in December 2015 that revealed the existence of a letter written by Havelange in 2010 claiming that disputed payments to him were above board and known to Blatter. An investigation by the FBI led to Blatter\u2019s ejection from Fifa later that month.</p> <p>Havelange and his wife, Anna Maria (nee Hermanny), had a daughter, L\u00facia, who was divorced from Teixeira in 1997, a granddaughter, Joana, director of the organising committee of the Brazil 2014 World Cup, and two grandsons, Ricardo and Roberto.</p> <p>\u2022 Jean-Marie Faustin Godefroid de Havelange, lawyer, sports administrator and businessman, born 8 May 1916; died 16 August 2016</p>",

They said the victim had been trying to protect his own dog and was left unconscious and bleeding. Upon arrival at the scene, a police officer fought the dog off the victim using a fire extinguisher.</p> <p>Under the 1991 Dangerous Dogs Act, pit bull terriers, Japanese tosas, dogo argentinos and fila brasileiros are banned from the UK unless the owner has been given a special court exemption. Dogs that have received an exemption must be muzzled, kept on a lead in public, neutered, tattooed and have a microchip implant. </p> <p>Dangerous dogs are classified by type rather than breed, so whether or not an animal falls under the legislation depends on its characteristics as judged by the authorities. Pit bull terriers were initially bred as fighting dogs by breeding bulldogs and terriers to produce a dog that was both agile and strong.</p> <ul> <li>This article was amended on 17 August 2016. A picture was removed of an English bull terrier, which is not the breed of dog involved in the attack.</li> </ul>",
  "<p>The popular central Liverpool pub the Fly in the Loaf \u2013 it was an old bakery \u2013 seemed to be full of drinkers most nights I have passed it.

I was chairing the meeting, while Guardian photographer Christopher Thomond captured proceedings \u2013 this article showcases some of his images.</p> <p>It is to their credit that so many were prepared to turn out on a wet midweek evening to discuss politics.

  "<p>Even now, days later, the very thought of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/daniel-barenboim\">Daniel Barenboim</a> leaves me exhausted.

I was press-ganged into his campaign to eat more pudding than the waiters thought absolutely wise. Only one of us came out a happier man. Even the adjectives were explosive: in Barenboim-world, nothing is merely fine \u2013 it is \u201cfun-TUSS-tic\u201d. At 73, he is among the most venerated of all classical musicians. He is also as relentless as a stag weekend.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"07cc1bda9e440caa267e0ef37339daa5d0dd9260\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/07cc1bda9e440caa267e0ef37339daa5d0dd9260/0_255_1920_1918/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Daniel Barenboim aged 13 at his Royal Festival Hall debut in 1956.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Barenboim aged 13 at his Royal Festival Hall debut in 1956.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cTo be famous young and to make fame last \u2013 the secret of combining the two is glandular,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/arts/critic/feature/0,,567652,00.html\">Kenneth Tynan</a> wrote of <a href=\"http://www.noelcoward.com/\">No\u00ebl Coward</a>. \u201cIt depends on energy.\u201d The same goes for Barenboim.

The musicians of the <a href=\"http://www.west-eastern-divan.org/\">West-Eastern Divan Orchestra</a> are gathered onstage at the Teatro Colon opera house. In jeans and sweatshirts, the eldest among them were still only half the age of Barenboim, who perched on his conductor\u2019s podium in a crisp black shirt and navy trousers. He\u2019s been performing here since 1960.</p> <p>They began with <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXonlYzpT-0\">Siegfried\u2019s Funeral March</a> from Wagner\u2019s G\u00f6tterd\u00e4mmerung. And for the rest of the morning, they just kept beginning. Over and over. The first few low bars of menace would fill the hall, then the conductor would shout: \u201cSTOP STOP STOP. It must be absolutely claustrophobic. EEE-vil!\u201d</p> <p>Again.</p> <p>\u201cSTOP. What is with you today?\u201d</p> <p>Again.<br></p> <p>\u201cSTOP.\u201d It had not been apparent before how suitably built Barenboim is to convey anger. But his hooded eyes were flashing, the barrel chest and jutting arms thrust out.<br></p> <p>The cellists were beaten up for a full 20 minutes. Accusations of laziness were flung around, of musicians having skipped \u201chotel-room practice\u201d.<br></p> <p>Over half an hour Barenboim did not allow the orchestra more than 30 seconds into the March. In two days\u2019 time, this piece would be performed here as part of a sequence of Wagner excerpts stitched into a kind of symphony. \u201cWe haven\u2019t even begun to hear how it\u2019s going to sound!\u201d he bellowed, as if this was news.<br></p> <p>Again.<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2db85d6179785b47c540fdb5e4f2e09c512053ee\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2db85d6179785b47c540fdb5e4f2e09c512053ee/0_53_4200_2520/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Daniel Barenboim during a reherseal with the West-Eastern Divan Orchestra at the Teatro Colon, in Buenos Aires.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Barenboim rehearsing with the West-Eastern Divan Orchestra at the Teatro Colon.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alejandro Kirchuk/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cSTOP.\u201d<br></p> <p>The longer this went on, the more the ensemble wilted. After two weeks of concerts and rehearsals, they were already \u201creally exhausted,\u201d one said to me. \u201cA lot of music in the head and a lot of problems.\u201d Finally, on being allowed to progress on to the next few bars, the players burst into an ovation of pent-up frustration.</p> <p>\u201cThe greatness of a musician is measured by the degree of fanaticism he brings to his playing,\u201d writes Barenboim in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/aug/23/nonfiction.music.books\">his memoirs A Life in Music</a>. If, as a violinist, you fail to produce just the right accent on a note: \u201cIt should cause you almost physical pain.\u201d</p> <p>Now, at one such pang of pain, Barenboim wheeled around to his assistant, who had led earlier rehearsals. Two days ago, the shaven-headed and sharp-suited Julien had sat on the stage as a page-turner in Barenboim\u2019s duet with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/apr/26/staatskapelle-berlin-daniel-barenboim-martha-argerich-lisa-batiashvili-royal-festival-hall-review\">Martha Argerich</a>. As the two legendary pianists sprang through Brahms\u2019 Haydn Variations, Julien had leaned forward to flip the score \u2013 only for Barenboim to slap him away, in front of 3,000 people. This time, the assistant sat a few rows back in the dark of the stalls.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2011/apr/17/daniel-barenboim\">Daniel Barenboim: unstuff your shirts</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Evidently, not far enough back. \u201cJULIEN,\u201d Barenboim yelled. \u201cWhat have you been doing? They have no clue.\u201d Throughout the rehearsal, the polymath had hopped between English, Spanish, Italian and French \u2013 but for 24-carat bollockings he preferred German. His shout \u201ckeine Ahnung\u201d carried through all seven storeys of the gilt and red plush of the Colon.</p> <p>Visiting that week was a conductor at the national conservatory, Rodrigo Gonzalez Jacob. From his box seat, the 35-year-old marvelled at the last of a previous epoch of conductors. Like the late Georg Solti and Herbert von Karajan, Barenboim had made his name during the long boom of the record industry, when classical music could command private budgets on top of public handouts and the term \u201cmaestro\u201d was used without irony.</p> <p>\u201cSome in my generation see him as despotic, monarchical,\u201d Gonzalez Jacob said. \u201cI don\u2019t think any musicians would stand me screaming at them the whole rehearsal, the whole day.\u201d But then, he wasn\u2019t Barenboim. \u201cI\u2019ve learned more in a week of watching than I have in my last five masterclasses.\u201d</p> <p>That Tuesday, the session concluded three-and-a-half hours later with the warning: \u201cI\u2019m afraid you won\u2019t be ready in time.\u201d Musicians headed back to their hotel for a short rest, before another long rehearsal in the afternoon. Barenboim now had to endure a Guardian interview. On learning I was of Bengali origin, the lifelong friend of Mumbai\u2019s Zubin Mehta regaled me with his headwaggling Indian accent. \u201cKul-kutta. Vot are you saying?\u201d He has somehow a reputation as a skilled mimic, but this was Peter Sellers. Then came another voice: \u201cWaare\u2019s me boonch of flaars?\u201d This, he assured me, was \u201cthe North Coon-try\u201d accent of opera singer Dame Janet Baker.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"7037d90d39b74f456eb729ac887cb8bdeb8547d7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7037d90d39b74f456eb729ac887cb8bdeb8547d7/1661_1137_2539_1523/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Barenboim speaks with Aditya Chakrabortty backstage at the Teatro Colon.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Barenboim speaks with Aditya Chakrabortty backstage at the Teatro Colon.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alejandro Kirchuk/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In the five-minute walk between theatre and restaurant, the classical musician was stopped four times by strangers who wanted to shake his hand, touch his arm, thank him. One woman strode up, clapping loudly. \u201cMuy bueno! Muy BUE-no! Felicitaciones.\u201d</p> <p>It was near here that Barenboim\u2019s own performing career began. On Fridays, he would play chamber concerts at a businessman\u2019s house. \u201cI loved to go mostly because his wife made the best apple strudel.\u201d There, aged seven, he met an eight-year-old Argerich. \u201cWe used to play under the piano.\u201d</p> <p>Both parents were piano teachers, and would take him to see the great musicians touring Buenos Aires. The young Barenboim saw Furtw\u00e4ngler, violinist Adolf Busch and virtuoso pianist Arthur Rubinstein. \u201cYou used to queue for three days and two nights for tickets for Rubinstein. People stayed in the queue for the whole day.\u201d The child prodigy enjoyed a \u201cdouble life. I would go to school, come home and play football, then give a concert.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Some see no point in the orchestra\u2019s philosophical dialogues: 'There\u2019s a lot of heat, but they never resolve anything'</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>As Julien and the cellists would be glad to hear, he also committed plenty of his own gaffes. Take his first-ever recital in Britain, in Bournemouth. The name was rolled around his mouth, like a glug of Malbec: Bawn-mouf. He was into the final strait of a Mozart concerto in E-flat and the \u201clast movements of Mozart concertos are sometimes quite similar in rhythm and speed. Even the melodies.\u201d All of a sudden, \u201cI mistakenly landed in another concerto, this time in B-flat.\u201d Luckily, his conductor had all Barenboim\u2019s humour and none of his temper. \u201cHe said, \u2018It\u2019s OK \u2013 as long as you don\u2019t charge double for playing two different pieces.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Having picked the restaurant \u2013 a barbecue with a giant firepit in the front window and a corrugated-iron ceiling \u2013 Barenboim was now ordering platters of meat, pumpkin and chips. Even as he did so, waiters kept bringing complimentary dishes: metal trays of grilled pork and empanadas. While forking food towards me and his chief executive, Tabar\u00e9 Perlas, the conductor discussed the members of the Divan Orchestra. He and Perlas could name all 100 of them, from more than 10 countries. They told me where X lived, whether Y was clever. Barenboim works with four orchestras regularly, but it is the Divan musicians that he calls \u201cmy people\u201d. While touring, they live in \u201cThe Sovereign Independent Republic of the West-Eastern Divan\u201d.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kq3aRicsvH0\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/kq3aRicsvH0?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>When it began in 1999, \u201cthe Palestinians from Nazareth had never met the Palestinians from the territories, let alone an Egyptian or a Syrian.\u201d As Barenboim has written, the hope is that by \u201chearing the painfulness of the other side for the first time\u201d they \u201cthink about the past and the suffering that has lasted so long.\u201d Through sharing a music stand, occupier and occupied could share their histories and their politics. It is an idea that has captivated journalists, film-makers and audiences. Yet over 16 years, the Divan has changed from a youth orchestra to one with its fair share of thirtysomethings with less time and patience for seminar-room discussions. \u201cThey need to check on their own children,\u201d one member told me. \u201cOr get a bit more sleep\u201d.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I find these theological states very, very dangerous \u2013 in this respect Israel and Iran are twin brothers</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Even more striking is the cooled enthusiasm among the musicians themselves. Some, especially those from Israel, would still vouch for how having colleagues from neighbouring territories has made them more loving of their neighbours. But others saw no point in the orchestra\u2019s hallmark philosophical dialogues: \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of heat, but they never resolve anything.\u201d<br></p> <p>While admiring of Barenboim, Palestinian violinist <a href=\"http://www.west-eastern-divan.org/news/musician-spotlight-tyme-khleifi/\">Tyme Khleifi</a> acknowledged that whenever tensions rose in the Middle East, they were magnified in the orchestra. She recalled the Lebanon war of 2006. \u201cThe Lebanese musicians couldn\u2019t come and the Syrian musicians weren\u2019t allowed to come by their government \u2013 out of solidarity with Lebanon. So who did you have? A few Palestinians, a few Egyptians [compared to many Israelis] \u2026 even the numbers were imbalanced. There were people whose families were getting bombed on the Lebanese side; there were people whose families were getting bombed on the Israeli side. While all of this was going on, we were rehearsing. The atmosphere was very charged. In Arab culture, music is for celebration. You don\u2019t play music at funerals. And so there were questions about what we were doing here, whether we should be playing at all.\u201d Eventually, Barenboim persuaded the ensemble to play as a \u201csimple statement\u201d.</p> <p>Reading that story, a cynic could say it shows up Barenboim as a latter-day Quixote. Why does he keep trying to reconcile the irreconcilable? Others might find evidence of moral courage, cleaving to an ideal even as others ditch it.</p> <p>Holding both Israeli and Palestinian nationalities, and owning a house in Jerusalem, Barenboim has got in ever-deeper trouble in Israel. Its president <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/jul/09/ewenmacaskill\">accused him of \u201ccultural rape\u201d</a> for performing music by Wagner, an antisemite, during a concert there. A government minister called him \u201ca real Jew hater\u201d. For his part, the musician has called the Israeli occupation of Gaza and the West Bank \u201cimmoral\u201d and backed a boycott of the Israeli government.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5defb7a938789758464baee1999995a02f43ad70\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5defb7a938789758464baee1999995a02f43ad70/0_75_1972_1183/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Daniel Barenboim conducts the West Eastern Divan Orchestra, rehearsing ahead of their Proms debut in 2003.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Barenboim conducts the West-Eastern Divan Orchestra, rehearsing ahead of their Proms debut in 2003.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sheila Rock/EMI Classics</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>He admits to \u201cone cousin\u201d in Buenos Aires who is \u201cvery upset with me\u201d.

That provoked fury in Israel \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/sep/01/iran-bars-daniel-barenboim-israeli-citizenship\">before being blocked by Iran on the grounds that it would not grant entry to an artist of \u201cthe Zionist regime\u201d</a>. To me, Barenboim claimed: \u201cWe\u2019re still planning to go. The concert was not cancelled, only postponed\u201d. But how did he feel under political artillery from both sides?</p> <p>\u201cThe Iranian government still denies the Holocaust \u2013 so you can\u2019t take them seriously. And the Israeli government spreads rumours and disinformation about Iran \u2013 because it needs to for the creation of panic. I find these theological states \u2013 and in this respect Israel and Iran are twin brothers \u2013 very, very dangerous.\u201d</p> <p>To contrast with that polarisation, Barenboim told a story that began in 1966, with him playing the Prague Spring festival. When he got to the stage door, two young men were waiting. They were from Syria and they wanted to see his rehearsals. \u201cI\u2019d never met a Syrian in my life.\u201d </p> <p>They had coffee and hung out, \u201ca wonderful time\u201d. Then they asked for tickets to the next day\u2019s performance, featuring Arthur Rubinstein with the Czech Philharmonic. Barenboim, who was leaving before the concert, could do nothing. But he did take them in to the rehearsal, then went backstage to mention them to Rubinstein. At first, the legendary pianist thought this was another of Barenboim\u2019s \u201csilly jokes\u201d, before getting excited: \u201cI\u2019ve never met an Arab musician!\u201d All four went for lunch, before Barenboim had to go.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Music can teach you about life, about how to make passion and discipline co-exist</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>When the West-Eastern Divan orchestra formed in 1999, seven Syrians joined. \u201cI was so curious. How did they manage to come? For Syrians it was against the law to have any contact with Israelis.\u201d He got talking to two \u201cpretty girls\u201d and \u201cafter a little flirt\u201d, one of them said, \u201cSooll-key\u201d. What was Sooll-key?</p> <p>She tried again: \u201cSoulkhy. He met you in Prague.\u201d</p> <p>One of those young men waiting at the stage door had gone on to become director of one of the most prestigious conservatories in the Middle East. Thirty-three years later, he wrote to the Syrian minister for culture about a workshop for young musicians in Germany. No word of Israeli involvement, just an assurance of Mr Barenboim\u2019s reputation and a request for a few students to go. \u201cCan you believe that? After 33 years.\u201d</p> <p>More than a happy ending, it is a tale of the triumph of Barenboimian virtues: improvised cultural exchange, institution-building and a bit of cheek. \u201cI don\u2019t consider myself a political person \u2013 I don\u2019t try to make contacts or get the cellular number of a minister,\u201d he says.</p> <p>But he can do politics \u2013 and he can win. Later that week, a violinist from Damascus, Nouras Hanana, told of how he had heard from Barenboim that he had been lobbying the government of Argentina to take in Syrian refugees. \u201cI wanted to hug him,\u201d he said.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"04f5b42a929031808f421520ed0cce2c3511fcfe\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/04f5b42a929031808f421520ed0cce2c3511fcfe/0_164_4200_2520/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Daniel Barenboim conducts the West-Eastern Divan Orchestra at the Teatro Colon.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Daniel Barenboim conducts the West-Eastern Divan Orchestra at the Teatro Colon.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alejandro Kirchuk/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Barenboim confirmed that he had rung the new president of Argentina, Mauricio Macri, straight after his election victory in late November. The call was also on behalf of Martha Argerich, he said, since both their grandparents had benefited from the generosity of Argentina in accepting refugees and immigrants. </p> <p>Macri came to Berlin in July, when Barenboim pressed him again. In the conductor\u2019s telling, the president said it was \u201ca little problematic\u201d but that \u201cI think we can do 3,000\u201d. (Argentina\u2019s Foreign Office confirmed that Macri and Barenboim met in Berlin, but would not provide details of the conversation.) That same week, Buenos Aires announced it would accept 3,000 Syrians. Amid rehearsals at the Colon, Barenboim had also visited foreign minister Susana Malcorra. It is hard to think of another classical musician anywhere in the world who would have put in such an effort \u2013 or been taken seriously by a country\u2019s leadership.</p> <p>Barenboim still boils over with plans. He wants to tackle the gulf between a class of musicians who are technically skilled but ignorant of their society, and a wider society that can\u2019t understand classical music. This autumn his Barenboim-Said Academy in Berlin begins teaching a degree course in music, coupled with twice-weekly philosophy lessons. He is also looking for a primary school in Germany to follow a programme of music education set by him and the Berlin Staatskapelle.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>There comes a point when your brain wants to think of tomorrows and your body reminds you of yesterday</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>He has already opened a music kindergarten in Berlin and Ramallah. \u201cBut when the children go to primary school, most of them forget.\u201d After that will come a secondary school \u201cso if you are an intelligent parent\u201d your child can be taught music \u201cfrom day one of kindergarten until the Baccalaureate at 18\u201d. Barenboim has two sons with his second wife, Elena Bashkirova: the youngest, Michael, is a successful violinist; the eldest, David used to manage a German hip-hop outfit. They all live in Berlin.</p> <p>\u201cMusic can teach you about life, about how to make passion and discipline co-exist,\u201d cries the maestro. It all comes back to girls \u2013 again. \u201cYou get madly in love with somebody and you have to continue working and [he claps] it doesn\u2019t work! Then the passion is gone, the girl disappears and you are left only with the work. Then you get only discipline and you get dry and in a bad mood. But in music you cannot play two notes without learning the co-existence of passion and discipline.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"108adf8c1db3d836b65a06918050fc331669a761\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/108adf8c1db3d836b65a06918050fc331669a761/0_262_2717_3938/690.jpg\" alt=\"Portrait of Daniel Barenboim, Argentine orchestra director.\" width=\"690\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018You cannot play two notes without learning the co-existence of passion and discipline\u2019 \u2026 Daniel Barenboim.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alejandro Kirchuk/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Undercutting all this is a newer fragility. Throughout the week he complains of being \u201cshattered\u201d. He was driving himself as hard as the young musicians, who in turn told stories of how at one rehearsal he had fallen off the podium and cut his leg. At one performance, he had shouted so hard at the violins that his conductor\u2019s baton had snapped and he gouged his own hand.</p> <p>Asked about his hopes for the future, his first response is: \u201cOne thing only: I don\u2019t want to age in such a way that the quality of my life is reduced. There comes a point when you have a separation between brain and body \u2013 a brain who wants to think of tomorrows and the body who reminds you of yesterday.\u201d He talks repeatedly of how he can no longer put on his socks standing up. More than once I found myself inspecting him as if he were an elderly relative, for early warnings of issues to be dealt with. This cut on his cheek, that gash running behind his ear.</p> <p>But on my last night, he and the orchestra are performing to a packed house. I watch backstage. Before going on to perform Liszt, Martha Argerich stomps on the red carpet and growls. In between turns, Barenboim perches on a stool, observing in semi-seriousness to me \u201cthe finest girls\u201d in the orchestra. Then the Wagner and the concert are all over and he comes off stage to a standing ovation. On the other side of the curtain are nearly 3,000 people \u2013 from the fur-wearer in the stalls to the T-shirt-clad up in the cheap seats \u2013 all on their feet applauding this man of a more expansive, optimistic time. He slides off the stool and goes back on stage for another encore. </p> <p>\u2022<a href=\"http://www.royalalberthall.com/tickets/proms/proms-2016/prom-43-martha-argerich-daniel-barenboim-and-the-west-eastern-divan-orchestra/\">Daniel Barenboim conducts the West-Eastern Divan Orchestra at the Proms on 17 August</a>.

  "<p>The death of the former footballer Dalian Atkinson after being Tasered by the police in Telford has prompted <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/16/dalian-atkinson-taser-death-police-institutional-racism\">renewed concern about police use of the weapon</a>. There have been at least 17 deaths linked to the use of Tasers since they were introduced in 2003. </p> <p>In July 2014 the <a href=\"https://www.ipcc.gov.uk/page/research-and-statistics\">Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) found that none of the eight deaths it had completed investigating at the time was directly caused by Tasers</a>. Since those investigations were completed there have been nine more Taser-linked deaths. Here is a timeline of deaths, and other incidents, linked to the use of Tasers in the past decade. <br></p> <p><strong>May 2006</strong><br></p> <p><a href=\"https://www.ipcc.gov.uk/news/ipcc-concludes-managed-investigation-death-john-butler\">Officers from Greater Manchester police fired two Tasers at <strong>John Butler</strong> after he shot himself</a> in the head at the end of a 19-hour standoff in Skelmersdale, Lancashire. An investigation found that use of the Taser was justified as Butler was still alive at the time and holding a gun. The inquest verdict was suicide. </p> <p><strong>October 2006</strong></p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2008/jan/21/ukcrime.uknews4\"><strong>Brian Loan</strong>, 47, died three days after being shot with a Taser</a> and baton round by officers from Durham police after acting aggressively towards them in Sacriston, County Durham. A postmortem concluded the death was due to natural causes.</p> <p><strong>October 2006 </strong><br></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.kentonline.co.uk/kent/news/shooting-of-bank-robber-bob-hain-a88794/\"><strong>Robert Haines</strong> was Tasered after being shot by a Metropolitan police officer</a> after robbing a building society in New Romney, Kent, armed with a shotgun. The IPCC found that the use of a Taser was an appropriate tactic to minimise the potential risk. An inquest found he was lawfully killed by multiple gunshot wounds.</p> <p><strong>January 2008</strong></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.bedfordshire-news.co.uk/schizophrenic-knifeman-hears-inquest/story-21709983-detail/story.html\"><strong>Justin Petty</strong>, a 31-year-old man who had bipolar disorder, cut his throat in his mother\u2019s loft in </a>Goldington, Bedfordshire, after being Tasered by an officer from Bedfordshire police.

Northumbria police officers fired Tasers at Moat before the weapon he was holding went off and killed him. An inquest later ruled that Moat took his own life after police fired an unapproved Taser at him.</p> <p><strong>August 2011 <br></strong></p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2013/jan/21/police-taser-death-dale-burns\"><strong>Dale Burns,</strong> a 27-year-old bodybuilder from Barrow-in-Furness, was Tasered four times</a> by officers from Cumbria police in less than a minute as they struggled to arrest him. A coroner found that the death of Burns, who had been Tasered and pepper-sprayed by officers from Cumbria police about a week earlier, was caused by the use of the drug Madcat, rather than police action.</p> <p><strong>August 2011</strong></p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/dec/22/tasers-ipcc-police-deady-history-uk-debate\"><strong>Philip Hulmes</strong>, 53, died after he was Tasered at his home in Bolton</a>, Greater Manchester. Police said he had threatened officers with a knife, and only at that point did it become apparent he had already stabbed himself. The inquest found that Hulmes took his own life while the balance of his mind was disturbed.</p> <p><strong>February 2012</strong><br></p> <p><a href=\"https://www.ipcc.gov.uk/news/findings-issued-following-inquest-death-ernestas-anikinas-gatwick-airport-railway-station\">Lithuanian man<strong> Ernestas Anikinas</strong> died after cutting himself with a broken bottle</a> at Gatwick airport. He dropped the bottle after being Tasered by two police officers. An investigation found that the use of Tasers was appropriate.

  "<p>Sporting success is intergenerational. The UK\u2019s sports bodies, which are basking in the glory of outrageous success at Rio, are not just planning for Tokyo in 2020, but already looking to 2024 and beyond. Standing still is not an option \u2013 except maybe in small-bore shooting, where even the merest twitch will spell disaster. With the possible exception of boxing, the UK is punching above its weight in Rio, and part of the reason for the success is that one generation is inspiring the next. The cliche that the stars of the future are galvanised by the heroes of today appears to be true.

  "<p>Of all the hats Georgia congressman John Lewis has worn over his more than 50 years in public life as a protester, activist and representative for Georgia\u2019s fifth district, perhaps none is more unexpected than that of comic book protagonist. </p> <p>But now, nearly eight years after the idea was hatched for the March trilogy \u2013 a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/feb/10/black-history-month-best-books-authors\">graphic novel memoir of Lewis\u2019s experiences in the civil rights movement</a> \u2013 Lewis hopes it will help inspire a new generation to get into what he likes to call \u201cgood trouble\u201d, and help young Americans understand how far the nation has come.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ve changed much. I still consider myself an activist,\u201d he says. \u201cI tell people all the time if you see something that is not fair, not right, and not just, then you have a moral obligation to do something about it \u2013 to get in the way, to get in trouble.\u201d</p> <p>Most recently, Lewis got in the way during <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jun/22/house-democrats-stage-sit-vote-gun-control\">a June sit-in to protest congressional inaction on gun control</a> after the mass shooting that left <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/orlando-terror-attack\">49 dead in an Orlando nightclub</a>. That time, the protest ended without confrontation. For Lewis, that makes it an outlier. The 75-year-old has been arrested more than 40 times in his life, and five times since he was elected to Congress nearly 30 years ago. Lewis added with pride: \u201cI\u2019ll probably get arrested again.\u201d</p> <p>Many of those arrests are depicted in the more than 500 pages of illustrated civil rights history covered in March, which released its final instalment earlier this month.

That episode left Lewis with scars on his head that are still visible. </p> <p>The medium of a graphic novel might seem counterintuitive for such heavy subject matter. It was certainly without precedent as a publication by a sitting congressman. But in fact, a little-known and sparingly pressed comic, the 1956 publication Martin Luther King and the Montgomery Story, served as an integral part of Lewis\u2019s early civil rights education in the principles and practices of non-violence. \u201cIt became like our Bible, our guide. It influenced so many of us,\u201d Lewis says.</p> <p>The comic told the story of how black Montgomery citizens organized and used nonviolent resistance to protest and ultimately overturn Jim Crow segregation on buses in Montgomery and throughout the state of Alabama. Published by the Fellowship of Reconciliation, a faith-based nonviolent action fellowship, the 14-page illustrated account of the Montgomery bus boycott has remained popular with activists around the globe for decades.

And Daddy King, as we called him, would say: \u2018Make it plain, son, make it plain,\u2019\u201d Lewis recounted.

But March is also a cautionary tale. \u201cDon\u2019t make the same mistakes that we made. Stay focused,\u201d Lewis said. \u201cNever hate, never become bitter, never become hostile.\u201d And on this point, Lewis believes modern activists would do well to copy the discipline and preparation of his generation.</p> <p>\u201cWe had so called \u2018do\u2019s and don\u2019ts\u2019, and we lived by those. The day the first mass arrest occurred in Nashville, Tennessee, every single student arrested, all 89 of us, had a copy on them,\u201d Lewis said, adding: \u201cDiscipline is everything.\u201d The \u201cdon\u2019ts\u201d included not to \u201cstrike back nor curse if abused\u201d. The \u201cdos\u201d included to \u201cremember the teachings of Jesus Christ, Mahatma Gandhi and Martin Luther King. Love and nonviolence is the way.\u201d</p> <p>And for Lewis, while the names and faces, and the exact contours of racial oppression, have certainly changed over the past half-century, the strategy has not.

A Labour government would use the funds to restore cuts to the bus service operators\u2019 grant, Corbyn\u2019s campaign said. </p> <p>On Monday, Corbyn was revealed to have swept the board of constituency Labour party nominations, winning the support of 285 constituency Labour parties and Smith taking just 53 nominations.</p> <p>Nominations do not have a bearing on the leadership voting process but act as statements of support. Ballot papers will be sent out by post and email next Monday, to be returned by 21 September with a midday deadline.

  "<p>After an afternoon spent swimming in a Saskatchewan river, five friends piled into the car for the 50-minute ride home.<br></p> <p>As they headed to the Red Pheasant First Nation, a tyre blew out. They pulled into a nearby farm, hoping to find someone who could help them. </p> <p>Their account of what happened next has ignited racial tensions in the Canadian province of Saskatchewan and laid bare the divide that exists between some communities. </p> <p>\u201cAll of a sudden some guy, he just came out and he just smashed our windshield,\u201d said Eric Meechance, one of the car\u2019s occupants. </p> <p>Panicked and struggling to see past the cracked windshield, the driver tried to leave the farmyard. Instead, he struck a parked vehicle, Meechance told <a href=\"http://ckom.com/article/986522/victim-friends-needed-help-flat-tire-farmyard-shooting-witness\">local radio station News Talk 650.</a></p> <p>Meechance and the driver got out and ran for safety. Seconds later gunshots rang out. The farmer had a gun, Meechance <a href=\"http://www.metronews.ca/news/canada/2016/08/12/man-fatally-shot-in-saskatchewan-was-looking-for-help-with-flat-tire-cousin.html\">told the Canadian Press.</a> \u201cHe wasn\u2019t shooting to scare us. He was shooting to kill.\u201d</p> <p>He later found out that his friend, Colten Boushie, 22, had been fatally shot in the vehicle. </p> <p>The Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) said the five friends were confronted after they drove on private property last Tuesday. A verbal exchange followed and a shot was fired, striking one of the people in the car. </p> <p>A 54-year-old man has been charged with second-degree murder and is expected to appear in court later this week. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5c8d3adf42a63f79717d7225bae827b0fe01863a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5c8d3adf42a63f79717d7225bae827b0fe01863a/0_250_3500_2099/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Saskatchewan premier Brad Wall\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Saskatchewan premier, Brad Wall, urged residents not to jump to conclusions until the investigation into the incident had been completed.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mark Blinch/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Fundraising campaigns have raised thousands of dollars for those affected by the incident.

All were released without charges and the investigation is ongoing. </p> <p>The Federation of Sovereign Indigenous Nations, which represents more than 70 First Nations in Saskatchewan, called it a biased press release.</p> <p>\u201cThe news release the RCMP issued the following day provided just enough prejudicial information for the average reader to draw their own conclusions that the shooting was somehow justified,\u201d Chief Bobby Cameron said.</p> <p>The organisation called for a review of the RCMP\u2019s communication policies. </p> <p>\u201cThe media\u2019s initial portrayal of the event made the incident sound like a crime was about to be committed by the passengers in the car,\u201d said Chief Clint Wuttunee, of the Red Pheasant First Nation, whose daughter was also in the car. </p> <p>\u201cThe media based their reports on the RCMP\u2019s news release.\u201d </p> <p>Within hours the RCMP responded, saying it was concerned about the claims of bias. \u201cWe will be reaching out to them,\u201d said Rob Cameron, of the organisation. \u201cWe now have a chance to hear their concerns and work together and move forward.\u201d</p> <p>Robert Innes, a professor of Indigenous studies at the University of Saskatchewan, described the situation as a \u201creal example of the racial tensions that exist in Saskatchewan\u201d.</p> <p>He pointed to widely held fears of rising crime rates, despite data showing that crime in Canada has been falling since the 1990s. </p> <p>\u201cAnd then you combine that with a fear and contempt for young Indigenous men and you mix those two together and you end up with a situation like this,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Boushie\u2019s funeral was held on Saturday. As the family grieved for the loss of a young man who had been working to become a firefighter, social media and other forums were inundated with hate-filled comments.<br></p> <p>Some took aim at First Nations, linking them to crimes, while others praised the idea of vigilante justice. </p> <p>\u201cHis only mistake was leaving three witnesses,\u201d wrote one person on a Facebook page for Saskatchewan farmers that has since been taken down. \u201cHe should have shot all five and been given a medal,\u201d wrote another. </p> <p>The Assembly of First Nations condemned the comments, calling it a sad day for the province. </p> <p>\u201cTo see racist, derogatory comments about this young man and about First Nations people online and on social media in response to this tragedy is profoundly disturbing,\u201d said the organisation\u2019s national chief, Perry Bellegarde. </p> <p>\u201cThey are racist, insensitive and ignorant. They are disheartening and a stark reminder of how much work we have to do to eliminate racism and discrimination.\u201d</p> <p>The steady stream of hate prompted Brad Wall, the premier of the province, to urge residents not to jump to conclusions before the RCMP completed its investigation. </p> <p>\u201cThese comments are not only unacceptable, intolerant and a betrayal of the very values and character of Saskatchewan, they are dangerous,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/PremierBradWall/\">he wrote in a Facebook post.</a> \u201cThere are laws that protect citizens from what this kind of hate may foment. They will be enforced.\u201d</p> <p>The views being posted are not new, Innes said. The novelty is social media, which allows them to be shared readily. </p> <p>\u201cThis is the attitude that permeates Saskatchewan and the prairie provinces. It is right below the surface. People keep it in check, they\u2019re not open about it but it\u2019s everywhere,\u201d he said. </p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m very disappointed and very concerned about the kind of message that its sending to our youth. But I\u2019m not surprised.\u201d </p>",
  "<p>Friends who have devoted selfless hours to helping asylum seekers for decades get upset when someone suggests that many such people game the system, knowing that they will be rejected as the economic migrants they really are. But a veteran civil liberties lawyer I also know quickly changed her tune when she started examining appeals in detail. There is a lot of abuse, she concluded.</p> <p>Tricky, isn\u2019t it? People fight for all sorts of rights and humane procedures, only to see them cynically abused by false claimants, wicked people smugglers and nimble-footed solicitors.</p> <p>We admire lawyers who fight the police or NHS on behalf of mistreated clients, many of them poor people with no hope of redress without legal aid or the US-style \u201cno win, no fee\u201d provision introduced by Tony Blair\u2019s government. Films are made about their successes, in which even journalists, such as Chris Mullin in the Birmingham Six case, occasionally come out well.</p> <p>We also recoil, however, from adverts on low-grade TV channels offering all sorts of legal services to help people fight claims that, if successful, will probably help the law firm more than the client. Whiplash injuries in car crashes, sustained in suspiciously high numbers in Britain, are a notorious example. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2015/oct/03/whiplash-epidemic-pain-insurers-necks-motoring\">insurance industry struggles</a> to deal with the \u201ccompensation culture\u201d.</p> <p>The phrase that captures conflicting impulses is \u201cambulance chasing\u201d. One man\u2019s shining knight can be another\u2019s ambulance chaser. Which takes us straight to this week\u2019s reported news that the Birmingham lawyer Phil Shiner\u2019s Public Interest Lawyers firm is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/aug/15/public-interest-lawyers-iraq-war-al-sweady-theresa-may-uk-troops\">closing its doors</a> after the Legal Aid Agency ruled that it would no longer have access to legal aid funds. The move follows allegations, still being investigated, that PIL has committed assorted abuses in its pursuit of British military misconduct in southern Iraq. The firm has asked the high court to allow it to cease representing 187 Iraqi claims, with 1,000 more abandoned in the pipeline.</p> <p>A paragraph such as that may anger both sides in this kind of dispute. How dare a lawyer safe in London undermine the morale and cohesion of Britain\u2019s brave armed forces for doing their best in the near-impossible circumstances of a sectarian Iraqi civil war more horrible than the Troubles in Northern Ireland? To post-traumatic stress disorder is now added <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3383132/I-cleared-TWICE-lawyers-hounding-says-war-hero-Decorated-soldier-says-left-rot-death-Iraqi-civilian-armed-AK-47.html?ITO=1490&amp;ns_mchannel=rss&amp;ns_campaign=1490\">prolonged legal persecution</a>.</p> <p>Alternatively, how typical of the British establishment to shut down an expos\u00e9 of how western invaders really behave in an illegal war. Soldiers in battle must be required to respect the human rights of those that they fight. They and their commanding officers must be held accountable when they fall short in Iraq, Afghanistan or elsewhere.</p> <p>It goes without saying that Theresa May is reportedly pleased that PIL is going out of business and the defence secretary, Michael Fallon, a shrill tubthumper in most circumstances, is delighted. So are the papers that always \u201cdefend our boys\u201d - the Telegraph, the Sun and, of course, the redoubtable Daily Mail.</p> <p>I yield to no one in my distaste for what much of the Mail does. Its behaviour in the Brexit debate, before and after the referendum, has been disgraceful. Reading a centenary account of the Somme the other day, I noted generals hesitating to do the right thing in that dreadful battle for fear of what the Mail might say in 1916. But as I never tire of telling students or Twitter trolls: \u201cThe Daily Mail is not always wrong.\u201d </p> <p>In fact, it\u2019s often right, as regular readers, me and most of Fleet Street, know. Read <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3726115/Child-killer-s-2m-legal-aid-taxpayers-funded-Ellie-Butler-s-warped-father-s-battle-custody-little-girl-went-murder.html\">this shocking example</a> of justice abused that the paper exposed 11 days ago. It whips up hysteria and anxiety, day in and day out. But there\u2019s good stuff in the mix too: attacks on fatcat bankers, police chiefs, and insurance and supermarket ripoffs.</p> <p>Here\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3740538/His-firm-s-shut-soldiers-planning-SUE-him.html\">the long read</a> on the PIL case, by the feature writer Robert Hardman, always more measured than some of Paul Dacre\u2019s talented band of 1,500-word assassins. It charts Shiner\u2019s successes, including the \u00a32m payout to the family of Baha Mousa, the Iraqi hotel receptionist who died in military custody in 2003, and his awards from what the Mail likes to call \u201cthe legal establishment\u201d.</p> <p>Hardman also sets out the accusations that have laid PIL low: having triggered the \u00a331m Al-Sweady inquiry into the conduct of British troops in a 2004 firefight with insurgents, the firm sat on conflicting evidence that undermined its clients\u2019 case for a year, before withdrawing their claim. There are separate allegations of the bribery of witnesses, all of them disputed amid claims of political persecution, I should stress.</p> <p>Some of the most serious claims brought by Iraqis were not exaggerated, but \u201cdeliberate lies, reckless speculation and ingrained hostility\u201d lay behind them, Al-Sweady\u2019s investigating judge, Sir Thayne Forbes, concluded.</p> <p>Here\u2019s an <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/phil-shiner-interview-a-righter-of-wrongs-in-iraq-or-the-worst-kind-of-ambulance-chaser-10262065.html\">interview with Shiner</a> and here\u2019s the Guardian\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2016/apr/07/public-interest-lawyers-iraq-death-case-misled-court-judge-rules\">report on how</a> one allegation came to grief.<br></p> <p>It is not that courts and inquiries have not found that overstretched British forces did bad things in Iraq and Afghanistan, let alone, as Chilcot\u2019s inquiry confirmed, made a pretty poor overall job of their tasks in both countries, to the dismay of the Americans. They did.</p> <p>But spurious ambulance chasing in the name of human rights seems grubby in a very different way. Shiner is now facing a solicitor\u2019s disciplinary inquiry that he hopes to have conducted behind closed doors, citing ill health. He\u2019s entitled to all the protection that the law can provide. There are painful layers of irony in this unhappy saga. </p>",

  "<p>Jo\u00e3o Havelange, the Brazilian who reshaped the football world before his reputation was tainted by corruption scandals, has died aged 100 during a Rio Olympics that he helped secure and is taking place in a stadium once named after him.</p> <p>It was Havelange who paved the way for the huge commercial exploitation of major sporting events, including the Olympics and the World Cup, but also for the lurid allegations of bribery and corruption that have dogged them ever since.</p> <p>A former Olympic athlete, Havelange was an International Olympic Committee member from 1963 to 2011 and used his position at the head of the Brazilian FA (the CBF) during the golden period when his country won three World Cups, between 1958 and 1970, to launch a bid for control of Fifa.</p> <p>His campaign to oust Sir Stanley Rous as president marked a decisive moment in world sport. The Englishman was seen as fusty and out of touch, representative of a colonial old guard trying to maintain their grip on a global game, while Havelange ushered in a new way of doing business that mixed personal, political and corporate interests until they became indistinguishable.</p> <p>With the help of Horst Dassler, the Adidas scion who founded the sports marketing agency ISL, and Fifa\u2019s young secretary general, Sepp Blatter, Havelange oversaw an explosion in the governing body\u2019s revenues as broadcasting and sponsorship deals rolled in.</p> <p>Along the way, it has been alleged, he was one of a great many sports executives who shared in the proceeds. In 2010, the BBC produced a list of individuals, which included Havelange, who received bribes totalling $100m from ISL through front companies.</p> <p>In death as in life, Havelange took centre stage. The news of his passing quickly dominated headlines overshadowing the Olympic triumph of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/16/brazilthiago-braz-da-silva-elevated-to-national-hero-status-after-pole-vault-gold\">Brazil\u2019s first gold in the pole vault for Thiago Braz da Silva</a>.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/aug/16/joao-havelange-obituary\">Jo\u00e3o Havelange obituary</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The tone was respectful but far from universally laudatory. While newspapers noted Havelange had massively expanded Fifa and its finances, they also focused on his corrupt practices, obsession with power and occasional quarrels with Pel\u00e9.</p> <p>In a piece titled \u201cThe worst kind of politics\u201d, the influential columnist Juca Kfouri noted the behind-the-scenes deal-making of a figure who claimed to be free of ideological bias yet worked with Brazil\u2019s military dictators and then built a global empire that was bigger than that of many nations or multinationals. \u201cHavelange did the worst kind of politics when he claimed to be apolitical and he used this to justify his close relationship with dictatorships around the world, whether it was in Africa and South America,\u201d Kfouri wrote. \u201cIt\u2019s undeniable that he transformed Fifa into a great money-making machine and made football popular in the five continents. Unfortunately he did this with a family that even the Cosa Nostra [Italian mafia] has nothing on.\u201d</p> <p>TV stations showed images of his life \u2013 black-and-white photographs of him as a lawyer and member of the Brazilian Olympic team at the 1936 Berlin Olympics, as head of the Brazilian Football Confederation during a period when his country won the World Cup three times, and then as president of Fifa from 1974 to 1998, when the world football body expanded its reach with a system of patronage that strengthened his grip and left a legacy of corruption that continues to this day.</p> <p>Allegations of bribe-taking dogged his career and his family. In 1993, his former ally Pel\u00e9 accused Havelange\u2019s son-in-law Ricardo Teixeira, the then president of the CBF, of corruption, a charge which was denied. Six years later a German newspaper reported Havelange had accepted diamonds and other gifts in connection with Amsterdam\u2019s bid for the 1992 Olympics.</p> <p>In 2006, the British investigative journalist Andrew Jennings told the Brazilian senate that Havelange may have built a fortune of tens of millions of dollars from bribes paid through a front company. He also revealed that a $1m bribe apparently meant for Havelange had crossed the desk of Blatter, who was later found by the Fifa ethics committee to have been \u201cclumsy rather than criminal\u201d in his handling of it.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a6794cf5d59de1e6a8506e1b2fe5101ca5ab095c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a6794cf5d59de1e6a8506e1b2fe5101ca5ab095c/0_15_2625_1575/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Brazil won three World Cups under Havelange\u2019s presidency of the country\u2019s confederation.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Brazil won three World Cups under Havelange\u2019s presidency of the country\u2019s confederation.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Associated Press</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In 2011, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2011/dec/04/joao-havelange-resigns-international-olympic-committee\">Havelange resigned from the IOC</a> citing health concerns, the day before he was to appear before an ethics committee investigating claims that he received a bribe of $1m from ISL.</p> <p>But his influence continues to be felt. <a href=\"http://esportes.estadao.com.br\">Estado de S\u00e3o Paulo noted</a> that Havelange\u2019s connection and ability to secure votes played a decisive role in securing the Olympics for Rio de Janeiro during the bidding competition. \u201cI invite you all to come to my city, to honour the Games, on my 100th birthday. I ask you to join me to realise this dream,\u201d he told delegates at the 2009 IOC meeting at which Rio was named the first South American city to host the Games.</p> <p>On reaching his century on 8 May, he achieved that goal, though was too ill to take part in the Olympic torch relay that reached its conclusion in his home city of Rio. He died in the Samaritano hospital in the city\u2019s Botafogo district on Tuesday morning.

  "<p>This week sees the nationwide launch of <a href=\"https://www.bk.com/menu-item/whopperrito\">Burger King\u2019s Whopperrito</a>. No, you didn\u2019t read that wrong \u2013 the fast-food king has really put a Whopper in a burrito.</p> <p>Like <a href=\"https://www.kfc.co.uk/our-food/for-one/wraps/zinger-burrito\">KFC\u2019s burrito project</a> before it, the Whopperrito is a bland reminder that mediocre meals remain mediocre even when they put on new party clothes.</p> <p>But it points to a new trend in hipster food: the burritofication of all food types. Jeffrey Pilcher, a food historian and author of Planet Taco: A Global History of Mexican Food, says the burrito and the taco have become a new kind of shorthand for chefs. \u201cPut something in a burrito and it acquires this cool edge,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s a way of Americanizing foreign food, but without that McDonald\u2019s feel.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5250c3e14be4614743ec8005a148cc962a56aa0f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5250c3e14be4614743ec8005a148cc962a56aa0f/0_138_3872_2325/1000.jpg\" alt=\"If you can\u2019t stand chicken fries then try Burger King\u2019s new offering, the Whopperrito.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">If you can\u2019t stand chicken fries then try Burger King\u2019s new offering, the Whopperrito.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Charlotte Simmonds/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In San Francisco, the birthplace of the \u201cMission-style\u201d burrito \u2013 the meaty, rice-filled, bean-and-cheese experience that most will recognize \u2013 a growing number of cooks are experimenting with the burrito blueprint. The basics remain the same: a carpeting of carbs (usually rice), meat or fish, and something fresh (avocado, salads or vegetables) twisted up in a tortilla, bread or other wrap. But the results vary wildly.</p> <p>So if the burrito \u2013 not the burger \u2013 is now America\u2019s favorite food playground, who\u2019s getting it right and who\u2019s getting it wrong? I ate my way through nine burritos in four days to bring you the answer.</p> <h2><strong>What doesn\u2019t work</strong></h2> <p><strong>The Whopper-rrito</strong></p> <p>Burger King\u2019s burger in a burrito launched nationwide on Monday. Yes, we tried it. And yes, it\u2019s pretty lame. It lacks inspiration, texture and bite. It\u2019s a taco-flavored burger in a tortilla and none the better for it.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3685f18c8706c1d6f65d7ae8f74d138b10252ceb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3685f18c8706c1d6f65d7ae8f74d138b10252ceb/0_151_3872_2325/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Whopperrito, best left unwrapped.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Whopperrito, best left unopened.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Charlotte Simmonds/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>KFC tried a similar stunt last year by releasing a fried chicken and a pulled chicken burrito in the UK. I tried it on a rainy day in London and it was miserable, tasting simultaneously of nothing at all and overwhelmingly of artificial cheese.</p> <p>Conclusion: good burritos can be made in the same amount of time it takes to get a fast-food burrito and they aren\u2019t much more expensive (my Whopperrito meal cost nearly $7). Treat yourself to the real deal.</p> <p><strong>The ramen-rrito</strong></p> <p>Some restaurants in California have been putting <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/food/dailydish/la-dd-indomie-burrito-komodo-20151030-story.html\">ramen noodles</a> inside <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/-zuzEoI2Oe/\">burritos</a> and, while I have not actually tried it (nearby restaurants no longer serve them.

Despite rousing music and dramatic storytelling from Kleinrock, it is strikingly apparent that there is nothing sexy about the first node of the internet: a fridge-sized machine called the Internet Message Processor. Kleinrock tries to inject some pizzazz, describing the machine\u2019s innards as having a \u201cdelicious old odour\u201d.

Brimming with pride, he describes the cat-and-mouse game he played with the FBI and the social engineering he used to crack Motorola. This involved calling an employee at the company to convince her to send him the source code for a new cellphone. He relied on the gift of the gab to pull off the heist rather than code wizardry. Mitnick explains that it doesn\u2019t matter how much money a company spends on firewalls, antivirus and other intrusion prevention systems: humans are always the weakest link in security. \u201cPeople, not the technology,\u201d he insists. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/15/gabby-douglas-hounding-american-champion-olympics\">The hounding of Gabby Douglas: an unworthy end for a great American champion</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Elsewhere in the film, it\u2019s the technology that\u2019s the villain.

Trolls anonymously emailed graphic photos of Nikki\u2019s body at the scene of the accident to her father, Christos.

But after seeing him interviewed in Lo and Behold, you might think twice about taking him up on the offer. When Herzog asks him what he dreams about, there\u2019s a long pause where his eyes dart from left to right as he apparently defragments his hard drive before revealing that he only remembers his nightmares. Later, he reveals a Bond-villain-esque plan for an artificially intelligent hedge fund that would short consumer stocks, buy long on defence stocks and then start a war. \u201cAnd that would obviously be quite bad,\u201d he says, with all the emotion of a vacuum cleaner.</p> <h2>We\u2019re a long way off from a Terminator/Skynet scenario</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7b9c7bcb7445eadb990a6c64d3678575d1998ba7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7b9c7bcb7445eadb990a6c64d3678575d1998ba7/268_135_2723_1634/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Hasta la vista: A Terminator\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Hasta la vista: a Terminator.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Melinda Sue Gordon/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There\u2019s a charming array of robots showcased throughout the film, including a team of football-playing bots; self-driving cars; and a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/jun/14/gill-pratt-darpa-robotics-challenge-cloud-robots\">rescue droid called Chimp</a>. The latter, we are told, could have used its gripper to open a valve and prevent an explosion at the Fukushima nuclear power plant. Later, there\u2019s a philosophical discussion about us needing to more clearly define what it means to be human so we can encode ethics into robots and artificial intelligence as they start making decisions on our behalf. There\u2019s an accompanying shot of Honda\u2019s Asimo robot, a startlingly cute humanoid that is seen serving a drink to a female companion.

  "<p>A last-ditch effort to prevent yellow fever spreading through Kinshasa in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and potentially developing into a global epidemic is to be launched using vaccines containing a fifth of the normal dose because the global stockpile is so low.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/gallery/2016/aug/26/fighting-yellow-fever-in-the-democratic-republic-of-congo-in-pictures\">Fighting yellow fever in the Democratic Republic of the Congo \u2013 in pictures</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Yellow fever is frequently lethal, killing half of those who develop severe symptoms. It is transmitted by the bite of the <em>Aedes aegypti</em> mosquito, which is also responsible for the spread of Zika virus. There is a vaccine which protects people for life, but few adults had been immunised in Angola when yellow fever broke out there in December last year, and in the DRC, to where it has spread.</p> <p>If it takes hold in Kinshasa, a densely packed city of more than 10 million people, it is feared that infected mosquitoes could travel beyond the central African region, which has been experiencing so severe an outbreak that vaccine stocks are almost exhausted.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2016/08/angola_drc_yellow_fever/giv-31075E0r8API91VwS/\" data-alt=\"Number of confirmed yellow fever cases\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2016/08/angola_drc_yellow_fever/giv-31075E0r8API91VwS/\">Number of confirmed yellow fever cases</a> </figure>  <p> In Angola, there have been nearly 4,000 suspected cases of yellow fever of which 879 have been confirmed while DRC had 68 confirmed cases and more than 2,200 suspected cases, with about 400 reported deaths in the two countries, mostly in Angola. Almost 19m doses of vaccine have been administered since January, but there are only 5m left in the emergency stockpile. The vaccine takes a year to make, so even with the handful of manufacturers working flat out, stocks cannot be replenished quickly.<br></p> <p>\u201cIt has got us incredibly worried,\u201d said Ruairidh Villar of Save the Children, which is helping with the vaccination effort. \u201cWe\u2019ve just scrambled an emergency team to DRC to support a last-ditch vaccination campaign before the outbreak reaches Kinshasa. Our fear is it is likely to go global if we can\u2019t stop it soon and it hits the city.\u201d<br></p> <p>He added: \u201cIt is not as fatal as Ebola but it is pretty awful.

The first vaccination started a few weeks afterwards, but it could have been a bit more prompt.</p> <p>\u201cWhat does it tell us? Even if we have the best surveillance systems and tools, we still need the political will to act at local level, regional level and international level. As with Ebola, when that is not enacted, we always, always have a delay in the response. There were some critical weeks which basically allowed fertile ground for spread.</p> <p>\u201cThis makes me deeply saddened and also a little bit in despair. We need to act \u2013 a quick and prompt response.\u201d</p> <p>There have been reports of 1m doses of vaccine disappearing after being delivered to Angola, but the World Health Organisation denies any doses went missing. The government appears to have used the vaccine elsewhere in Angola.</p> <p>\u201cFollowing a review of the first round of vaccination campaigns in Angola, it was found that around 1m doses from the emergency stocks had been used to vaccinate people in other medical facilities that were not part of the initial approved emergency vaccination plans,\u201d a WHO spokesman said. </p> <p>A mass vaccination campaign in western DRC in May immunised more than 200,000 people, said Heather Kerr, Save\u2019s country director there. But it did not stop the spread. \u201cNow we\u2019re planning a second response with the emergency health unit. We work together with them to support the government. The plan is to vaccinate in all the provinces bordering Angola because the yellow fever originally arrived from Angola,\u201d Kerr said by Skype from Kinshasa.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d6008850f4c00b228a09d3d1af82240a92fb8b90\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d6008850f4c00b228a09d3d1af82240a92fb8b90/0_161_4500_2700/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A member of a Doctors Without Borders (MSF) team fumigates the Yolo Sud neighborhood of Kinshasa\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Time is running out to prevent the spread of yellow fever because the rains will begin in September.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jerome Delay/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cKinshasa is such a huge city.

Time is running out to check the spread, however, because the rains will begin in September.<br></p> <p>The emergency vaccination campaign beginning on Wednesday was one of the largest ever attempted, WHO said.</p> <p> \u201cWorking with ministries of health in the two countries, WHO is coordinating 56 global partners to vaccinate more than 14 million people against yellow fever in more than 8,000 locations,\u201d it said in a statement. \u201cThe yellow fever outbreak has found its way to dense, urban areas and hard-to-reach border regions, making planning for the vaccination campaign especially complex.\u201d</p> <p>The decision to give people one-fifth of the normal dose of vaccine \u2013 known as fractional dosing \u2013 was taken by WHO\u2019s strategic advisory group of experts on immunisation (Sage). There are some small studies that show it gives protection for at least a year and possibly longer. </p> <p>\u2033Protecting as many people as possible is at the heart of this strategy.

Since its inception in 2002, Global Fund-supported programmes have saved more than 17&#xa0;million lives.</p> <p>On 16 September, the Global Fund will hold its replenishment conference in Montreal, seeking to raise $13bn to build on this progress. Over the next three years, country-led programmes that the Global Fund finances aim to avert up to 300m new infections across these three diseases and, crucially, stimulate $41bn in domestic investments for health.</p> <p>Several regular investors in the Fund \u2013 including Australia, and the UK \u2013 have not yet announced their financial contributions. The potential benefits of this funding to implementing countries are obvious. But for investors, the Global Fund represents an opportunity both to manifest the ideal of global citizenship and to reap the dividends of greater security and stability that come with improvements in global health.</p> <p>At the opening of the International Aids Conference, Bill Gates described the Global Fund as \u201cone of the best and kindest things people have ever done for one another. It is a fantastic vehicle for scaling up treatments and preventive tools we have today \u2013 to make sure they reach the people who need them\u201d. Global commitment \u2013 financial and political \u2013 can end these epidemics for good.<br><strong>Michelle Imison</strong><br>Sydney, Australia</p> <h2><strong>Corbyn unfairly criticised</strong><br></h2> <p>Polly Toynbee gives convincing reasons why UK Labour voters should vote for Owen Smith in the leadership election <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jul/28/labour-owen-smith-jeremy-corbyn-policies\" title=\"\">(5 August)</a>. She paints a fine picture of a dynamic Labour party and approves of its leftward turn (for which she admits Jeremy Corbyn can claim credit) and the junking of the Blairite \u201cthird way\u201d .</p> <p>What she does not say is that these are already the policies of Corbyn, who has been consistent in his call for wages councils and increasing corporation taxes. She says that the choice is between two candidates on the left, soft and hard. What exactly defines Corbyn as hard left and Smith as soft left? Maybe \u201csoft left\u201d means left in words but not in reality and \u201chard left\u201d means left in words and action. If that is so then she has hit upon the reason why, in the face of underhand tactics by the Parliamentary Labour party (PLP) lapped up by the press, Corbyn continues to be very popular among Labour party members.</p> <p>One would expect the daily drip-feed of anti-Corbyn propaganda in the press would put a dent in his popularity, but it doesn\u2019t seem to be the case. The reason is that, in this world of \u201cpost-truth\u201d politics, people have learnt not to trust words, but actions. Trust comes with consistency and Corbyn has been consistent in his position on the left of the party for decades, whereas Smith came from nowhere and proposes more or less the same things.</p> <p>Labour party members voted overwhelmingly for Corbyn last year but apparently, according to the PLP, they voted wrongly so they must vote again. \u201cDemocracy is fine as long as you vote the way we want you to\u201d is guaranteed to stick in the gut and produce the opposite of what they hope.<br><strong>David Murray</strong><br>Montbrun Bocage, France</p> <p>\u2022 I read Polly Toynbee\u2019s article and was shocked at the double-talk that is repeated by the pro-Owen Smith caucus. Smith\u2019s election manifesto includes the pledge to bring the party together, yet by establishing his caucus of anti-Corbyn MPs, he is doing precisely the opposite: attempting to split the party.</p> <p>Smith\u2019s proclaimed agenda is so close to that of Corbyn that it can only be assumed that he and the other MPs opposed to Corbyn are doing so with a hidden Blairite agenda that is firmly opposed to many of Corbyn\u2019s socialist policies. It is clear from the overwhelming support for Corbyn that he is far from being weak or unelectable.</p> <p>To pursue election to parliament at the cost of abandonment of socialist principles and declared Labour party precepts is to undermine any hope of a social democratic government. To do this is destined to split the party, and that is what would make it unelectable. Electability follows from the declared adherence to principle, not from compromise and irresolution in the face of Tory reaction.<br><strong>Alexander Schoen</strong><br>London, UK</p> <h2><strong>Life in the Canadian Arctic</strong><br></h2> <p>Your Weekly Review article about life in the Canadian Arctic was keenly read <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2016/jul/05/struggle-iqaluit-north-south-tensions-canada-arctic-capital-inuit\" title=\"\">(29 July)</a>. I covered the north country for CBC Northern Service and other outlets from 1969 to 1973. At no time did I hear of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) shooting dogs to encourage Inuit people to stay in one place.</p> <p>However, there is no denying that there was a shortage of dogs even in my day. Indeed, the situation was so desperate that it forced the Italian explorer Guido Monzino, who wanted to re-enact Admiral Peary\u2019s dog trek to the Pole, to send his agents to Greenland to get the necessary number of dogs. When the Northwest Territories government heard about the project, it sent an officer to make sure that the dogs were returned after the expedition reached the Pole.</p> <p>The reason that there were no dogs in the Arctic, I was told, was because of the ubiquitous snowmobile. Most hunters used machines to hunt. However, as one veteran hunter told me, there was not much meat on a carburettor when you were caught in a whiteout at 50 below. The RCMP had their own dog teams that also gave way to machines.</p> <p>The RCMP was proud of its relationship with the Inuit people. However, they did make mistakes. The notorious E number system, where every Inuk was given a number, was finally phased out in 1967.<br><strong>Val Wake</strong><br>Lodeve, France</p> <h2><strong>Online split personality</strong><br></h2> <p>Oliver Burkeman\u2019s column <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/jul/05/why-you-should-step-away-from-the-online-you\" title=\"\">(5&#xa0;August)</a> introduced me to the \u201conline disinhibition effect\u201d, which I discovered has its own Wikipedia page and experts in academia to confirm it unequivocally as a new and strange Jekyll-and-Hyde phenomenon that at its worst leads to cyberbullying and even death threats.

I have seen more from him in the last 100 days (working to promote the economy and equality in the capital) than I saw in eight years of Boris Johnson. I feel like Khan is completely invested in this city \u2013 he is not merely concerned with building a career, but genuinely wants to see London remain the world hub it is despite Brexit. What\u2019s impressed me the most is how involved he\u2019s been with the city\u2019s people. During his campaign he was on the streets with <a href=\"http://arynews.tv/en/london-mayor-sadiq-khans-pictures-visiting-hindu-temple-go-viral/\">Hindu revellers celebrating Ganesh Chaturthi</a>. He was also <a href=\"http://www.pinknews.co.uk/2016/06/27/in-photos-london-mayor-sadiq-khan-leads-citys-pride-parade/\">present during Pride in London this year</a>, and he seems to genuinely want to see the best for everyone in this city, no matter their religious beliefs, sexual orientation or gender identity. In today\u2019s society where, especially recently, people have voiced intolerant views, it is massively important that one of the most influential figures in the world is an advocate for equality.</p> <p>I would really like to see his promises on the housing crisis and transport prices come to fruition. As a student, I spend a huge amount on rent and travel, and lowering costs would relieve a massive amount of pressure \u2013 a pressure that will increase as I continue my studies. </p> <h2>Jekaterina, 38, London: Khan has been all talk and no action<br></h2> <p><strong>Job:</strong> advertising manager <br><strong>Big issues for London:</strong> housing, hate crime and transport <br></p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Hate crime has risen dramatically since Brexit and this has not been tackled well enough.</p> <footer> <cite>Jekaterina</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Having a Muslim mayor is a testament to London\u2019s inclusive nature \u2013 it\u2019s a city that embraces diversity. Sadiq Khan has done well climbing the ranks of the Labour party and he has been stealthy in his remarks regarding the party\u2019s recent implosion. However, in other respects he has performed badly: Khan has been all talk and no action. Hate crime has risen dramatically since Brexit and this has not been tackled well enough. It\u2019s an issue that has affected me personally: I have been racially abused (I originate from eastern Europe) and my fears have not been allayed by our new mayor. He has not made his presence felt enough. Secondly, Khan has not done anything with respect to the housing market. I\u2019m 38, have worked hard in this country for 12 years, and feel hopeless when it comes to getting my foot on the property ladder. Thirdly, tube fares have not been frozen <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/sadiq-khan-accused-of-breaking-election-promise-to-freeze-london-transport-fares-a7070496.html\">as promised</a>. What\u2019s more, Khan has taken the credit for the work of his predecessor when it comes to the introduction of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2016/aug/14/night-time-economy-london-countdown-to-non-stop-city\">night tube</a>. <br></p> <h2>Craig, 30, London: I spend half my wages on rent \u2013 what will Khan do to help me?<br></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"6aa977f2a3dd0245e0126888b4ce2329299891fd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6aa977f2a3dd0245e0126888b4ce2329299891fd/0_0_280_280/280.png\" alt=\"Craig\" width=\"280\" height=\"280\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><strong>Job:</strong> humanities teacher<br><strong>Big issues for London:</strong> housing, transport and cost of living<br></p> <p>I voted for Khan and have been impressed by what he has done so far.

Some of his election commitments, however, haven\u2019t come to fruition, for example the drop in travel costs. I also don\u2019t like his plans to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/aug/03/met-deploys-600-extra-armed-police-in-london-to-counter-terror-threat\">arm more police</a>.

Post-Brexit, while everyone else was quitting/infighting/grasping after power, Khan promoted calm, rationality and tolerance, and made it clear that London is inclusive and forward-looking, welcoming to its European population. His first public engagement was a stand <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3579714/Sadiq-Khan-attends-Holocaust-memorial-act-Mayor-London-day-Labour-mayor-repeated-controversial-claims-Hitler-Zionist.htmlhttp://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3579714/Sadiq-Khan-attends-Holocaust-memorial-act-Mayor-London-day-Labour-mayor-repeated-controversial-claims-Hitler-Zionist.html\">against antisemitism (attending a Holocaust memorial)</a> and photographs since have shown him involved in inter-faith gatherings. He seems to be genuinely excited and proud to be mayor, and time will tell if he puts into practice all he has promised. Right now, while most politicians seem self-serving and manipulative, Khan appears to be a man who has principles and determination, and is genuine in a way many public figures are not. I am glad I voted for him. <br></p> <h2>Aran Lewis, 53, London: So far Khan hasn\u2019t done anything to impress me<br></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"17375bec0e4fb01946b7b0ee3dcfa88dc7affdf4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/17375bec0e4fb01946b7b0ee3dcfa88dc7affdf4/0_0_280_280/280.png\" alt=\"Aran-Lewis\" width=\"280\" height=\"280\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><strong>Job:</strong> PhD student<br><strong>Big issues for London: </strong>housing and sexual and violent crime</p> <p>I was impressed by Khan\u2019s majority in the mayoral race, but he hasn\u2019t done anything else to impress me yet. Any half-competent politician or marketing professional could have produced the bit of cuddly PR he trotted out after Brexit. Before the election he said his top priority was the housing crisis, but so far he has done nothing about this (apart from a meaningless commitment to <a href=\"http://www.insidehousing.co.uk/khan-plans-35-affordable-housing-policy/7016293.article\">35% affordable housing in new developments</a>). Khan hasn\u2019t even defined what \u201caffordable housing\u201d means.

I\u2019ve been most impressed by his clean image: he ran a clean campaign, despite being attacked by someone running a vile one. He also conducts himself in a civilised and dignified manner.

It isn\u2019t enough to simply promise to build more. London has infinite demand, and rents are still going up every month to eyewateringly high levels. I am very disappointed he ruled out rent controls as an option for bringing the market under control \u2013 we will never build enough to outstrip demand, so there needs to be a complementary intervention in the housing market to bring down costs. I am paying \u00a3620 a month for a box-room in a shared flat in Brixton, the same amount I would pay for a large three-bedroom terraced house in a leafy area of my hometown in Lancashire. Sadiq needs to do more to bring the cost of rents under control, because increasingly more people are being priced out, which is just unfair.</p> <p>So, in conclusion \u2013 I\u2019d say he\u2019s had a good start, but I hope that he is bold going forward and will properly tackle the housing nightmare in London (not just tinker round the edges and let rents rise even higher).</p> <h2>Vikash Hansrani, 34, London: Boris made the London mayor role look like a joke<br></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"cc554502572c2c79ab8c8451a1a454d4e1ca20ef\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cc554502572c2c79ab8c8451a1a454d4e1ca20ef/0_0_280_280/280.png\" alt=\"Vikash Hansrani\" width=\"280\" height=\"280\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><strong>Job:</strong> director<br><strong>Big issues for London:</strong> crime, transport and pollution</p> <p>He is a sensible man with good ideas on how to make London a better city for all.

  "<p>During the fallout of the Madoff Ponzi scheme, the Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s inspector general issued a scathing report on why the agency failed to detect the massive fraud. One of its most damning findings was that multiple SEC offices simultaneously scrutinized Madoff without even realizing it.<br></p> <p>From 1992 to 2008, the SEC received at least six complaints about Madoff\u2019s firm that should have outed his fraud. The agency conducted two investigations and three examinations over the years. But the left hand didn\u2019t know what the right was doing. At one point, according to the inspector general, two examinations \u201cwere open at the same time in different offices without either knowing the other one was conducting an identical examination.\u201d Madoff slipped through the cracks, and Americans lost billions of dollars. </p> <p>This fraudster was able to fool financial regulators because they are still using 1930s pen and paper technology to handle today\u2019s digital challenges. This hurts investors, markets and the regulators\u2019 own missions. And that\u2019s why, along with some 34 other members of the House of Representatives, I am a sponsor of the Financial Transparency Act, HR 2477.</p> <p>For the most part, the major regulators collect information as plain\u2010text documents, rather than searchable, open data. Many of these documents date back to post-stock market crash compliance regulations passed during the Great Depression. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2016/feb/03/bernie-madoff-tv-miniseries-abc-wall-street\">Madoff: a creatively bankrupt television recounting of Wall Street\u2019s biggest fraud</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The SEC alone requires public companies, mutual funds and other entities to file hundreds of different forms, including Exhibit 21, which requires public companies to identify all subsidiaries. Most are uploaded as PDF documents, from which it is notoriously difficult to retrieve valuable information. Some tech companies try using a tedious workaround to extract data from PDFs known as scraping, but it is unreliable. In addition, the SEC still lacks a consistent identification code for each entity it regulates to allow it to quickly view a firm\u2019s filings, history, and external data sources. </p> <p>Repeat this same collection process across eight major financial agencies, hundreds of reporting systems, thousands of forms and the scope of the problem becomes clear \u2013 and a legislative solution is needed.</p> <p>The Financial Transparency Act requires each of the nine main financial regulators to adopt consistent data fields and formats for the information they are collecting under existing laws.</p> <p>For certain crucial data fields \u2013 like identifying regulated entities \u2013 the Financial Transparency Act also pushes the regulating agencies to coordinate with each other and adopt the same identification code. </p> <p>Such data standards would create a myriad of benefits. </p> <p>If the regulators adopted consistent data fields and formats for the information they already collect, instead of using PDF documents, they would have a better chance of catching fraudsters like Bernie Madoff and would make better decisions in crises. </p> <p>In addition, data standards would help financial regulators more easily detect risk. </p> <p>In the 1990s, the IRS and state tax authorities worked together to create consistent data fields and formats for individual tax returns. That is what made it possible for companies like Intuit to invent software like TurboTax which is used by many Americans each tax season. </p> <p>If financial regulators switched from documents to data, then existing software could help banks, public companies and other financial firms automate compliance efforts, just as TurboTax does today for taxpayers. </p> <p>In fact, if several regulators adopted the same fields and formats, then software could consolidate reporting tasks to all of them. Standardizing data to consolidate reports to multiple regulators is already happening in Australia, the Netherlands, the UK and elsewhere. The United States needs to catch up. </p> <p>Dumping documents for data would also create new opportunities for the tech industry. Technology firms could republish financial data for investors\u2019 decisions, analyze it to find hidden risk, and automate reporting to reduce compliance costs. </p> <p>Why haven\u2019t our regulators already figured this out? As the bureaucratic adage goes: \u201cIt\u2019s not my job.\u201d </p> <p>For example, as Commissioner Kara Stein has pointed out, the SEC has no chief data officer responsible for surveying the agency\u2019s whole data landscape. Instead, responsibility for data is split between all the dozens of different offices that handle the agency\u2019s different reporting regimes. </p> <p>But there is precedent for a legislative solution like the Financial Transparency Act to bring our regulators into the 21st Century. In 2014 Congress unanimously passed, and President Obama signed, the Data Act which mandates a single, government-wide data structure for federal government spending information. The Data Act means better transparency for taxpayers, better internal government management and automatic reporting for grantees and contractors. </p> <p>Think of the Financial Transparency Act as a Data Act for financial regulation. It isn\u2019t about collecting more or different information from the financial industry and consumers. The federal government already collects enough information on Americans as it is. Instead, this legislation makes better use of the information already being collected, and collects it more efficiently. This improves transparency and cuts down on time consumers and businesses spend each year on unnecessary paperwork. </p> <p>As seen in the Madoff debacle, the backwardness of US regulators isn\u2019t just an embarrassing contrast to the data-driven industry they are supposed to protect. It\u2019s actively harming our investors, markets and consumers. </p> <p>That\u2019s why the transformation of financial regulation from outdated documents into searchable data will be good news for those who report or use it. Better decisions by investors and regulators, and lower compliance costs, will translate to faster economic growth and greater consumer confidence in our economy. </p> <p>I urge my colleagues and the financial industry to get behind the Financial Transparency Act, and help get us into the digital century. </p>",

Campaigners accused the police of using excessive force and said the incident raised issues about policing and race. </p> <p>According to relatives, Atkinson was suffering from a weak heart and mental health problems. His brother, Kenroy, 53, said the former Premier League player had undergone dialysis for kidney failure and was \u201cnot in his right mind\u201d. </p> <p>He said his brother had attacked their 85-year-old father, Ernest, at his home on Monday before police were called to the scene. \u201cMy brother had lost it. He was in a manic state and depressed \u2013 out of his mind and ranting. He had a tube in his shoulder for the dialysis and he had ripped it out and was covered in blood,\u201d he told the Sun. \u201cHe got Dad by the throat and said he was going to kill him.

Speaking on BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme she said: \u201cIf the man has been Tasered three times, that is excessive use of force, and that is probably the reason he subsequently died. There should be a life-threatening incident before Tasers should be used. If in this incident there was no knife or gun or any weapon or any threat to the officer which they could deal with in the conventional ways, then the Taser should not have been used.\u201d</p> <p>She called for more rigorous training similar to the level used for firearms, before officers could be allowed to carry Tasers. \u201cThe regulations for Tasers are not strong enough and the training is not up to standard where we can be confident Tasers will be used safely,\u201d she said.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cc81e1d16fd88d6ea9cae91c2c344e5ba9d2f5e4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cc81e1d16fd88d6ea9cae91c2c344e5ba9d2f5e4/0_0_3285_2366/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A Black Lives Matter rally in London, earlier this month.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"720\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A Black Lives Matter rally in London, earlier this month.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Marc Ward/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Atkinson\u2019s death has also prompted fresh concern about policing and race and particularly the way police deal with black people with mental health conditions. Black people are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/oct/13/black-people-three-times-more-likely-to-have-taser-used-against-them\">three times more likely</a> to have a Taser used against them by police than white people, according to figures released last year by the Home Office.</p> <p>UK Black Lives Matter, a new campaign launched earlier this month and inspired by the <a href=\"http://blacklivesmatter.com/\">US movement</a>, said the disproportionate use of Tasers against black people showed the police were still institutionally racist. </p> <p>In a statement it said: \u201cMore than two-thirds of police Taser uses have been against people with mental health issues. This is likely to disproportionately affect black people who are 17 times more likely to be diagnosed with a psychotic illness. The tragic death of Dalian Atkinson and at least ten other such cases in England and Wales over the last decade show, all too often Taser use is fatal. Even when Taser use is not fatal, the delivery of a 50,000-volt shock for the purposes of incapacitation is a cruel and degrading form of punishment. We consider its disproportionate use against black people as indicative of police institutional racism.\u201d</p> <p>Kevin Maxwell, a former detective with Greater Manchester police and founder of <a href=\"http://racismruinslives.com/\">Racism Ruins Lives</a>, said: \u201cI\u2019ve not blamed the police, I am simply saying this death and those before it are why Black Lives Matter is important.

Obviously we will have to await the outcome of the IPCC investigation for more information but it demonstrates that lessons have not been learned following the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/mar/01/sean-rigg-death-case-against-five-police-officers-referred-to-cps\">inquest into the deaths Sean Rigg in police custody</a> who also had a mental health condition.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cPolice forces should be upholding the law and protecting people, not causing their deaths.\u201d</p> <p>West Mercia police have yet to respond to reports that Atkinson was Tasered three times.

  "<p>The exam regulator, Ofqual, says too many schools have been asking for re-marks, so it has issued <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/changes-to-regulations-for-enquiries-and-appeals\">new guidance</a> to exam boards on how to handle such requests. So what does this mean for schools, pupils and parents?</p> <h2>How are re-marks changing?</h2> <p>The guidance states that a board must only change a student\u2019s final grade if the original examiner has \u201cmade an administrative error\u201d or \u201cfailed to apply the mark scheme properly\u201d. In other words, the grade will only change if there is a clear marking error rather than a difference of interpretation.</p> <p>\u201cThere is a common perception that there is always a single \u2018right mark\u2019 or a \u2018wrong mark\u2019 for some more extended answers,\u201d Julie Swan, executive director for general qualifications said <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/may/26/gcse-a-level-exam-appeals-remarks-change-tougher-challenge-results\">in May</a>. \u201cThis is a misunderstanding. If the examiner who is re-marking the script does not agree with the exact mark given, but can see that it still represents a fair interpretation of the mark scheme, it should stand.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>I want my child\u2019s paper to be re-marked. Do I need to apply via their school?</strong><br></h2> <p>Yes. This year Ofqual said that exam boards could, if they wished, accept re-mark requests directly from students. However, exam boards have said they have no plans to do so yet, arguing that teachers should be involved in the decision. This means you will still need to request a re-mark via the school or exam centre. <br></p> <p>Some schools do allow parents to pay for a re-mark. Fees vary, but AQA, the largest of England\u2019s exam boards, <a href=\"http://www.aqa.org.uk/exams-administration/results-days/post-results/clerical-check\">charges from \u00a37.55 per unit </a>for a clerical check at GCSE to \u00a347.10 per component for a priority review at A-level. Generally fees aren\u2019t payable if a review of marking results in a grade change, but keep in mind that marks can go down as well as up.<br></p> <h2>I\u2019m starting university this autumn. How long will I need to wait for a re-mark?<br></h2> <p>A-level candidates who have a university place that depends on their result should ask their school to request a priority re-mark. These take up to 18 calendar days, compared with up to 30 days for a normal re-mark. Requests need to received by 26 August. </p> <h2>Why are they cracking down on re-marks?</h2> <p>Because the number of requests has gone up so much. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/may/26/gcse-a-level-exam-appeals-remarks-change-tougher-challenge-results\">In 2014 there were 48% more</a> than the previous year, and individual inquiries about grades increased by a further 22% last year to more than half a million across GCSE, AS and A2. About 18% of these requests resulted in a change of grade. </p> <p>Ofqual is concerned that schools \u2013 which are under huge amounts of pressure to meet exam targets \u2013 have been requesting re-marks for any students who are close to a higher grade boundary. If a student is on a really high D grade \u2013 only a mark or two from a C \u2013 they will pay for their paper to be re-marked regardless of whether or not they think the D is the correct grade for that student. They have little to lose: the mark is unlikely to go down so much that it puts the student on an E, and they could get a slightly more generous marker who moves it up to a C. This is particularly the case in subjects with longer written answers such as English and the humanities.</p> <p>Ofqual says this puts unnecessary pressure on the system and undermines the marking process. In addition, some independent schools can afford to spend more on re-mark requests than state schools, and that isn\u2019t fair.  The clincher seems to be a study led by Amanda Spielman, the incoming Ofsted chief inspector, which found <a href=\"http://schoolsweek.co.uk/examiners-generous-during-re-marks/\">that examiners tend to more lenient when re-marking scripts after results day.</a></p> <h2>Is it still worth getting a re-mark?</h2> <p>If you genuinely believe that a paper has been marked incorrectly then yes, it probably is. But if a grade is on the cusp of the one above and you are wondering if it\u2019s worth having a re-mark, it seems less likely this will yield results under the new rules.</p> <h2>Why do teachers object to the changes?<br></h2> <p>Many school leaders argue that marking is poor quality and say that the clampdown on re-marks will do nothing to remedy this problem. Philip Britton, head of Bolton School Boys\u2019 Division, an independent school, <a href=\"http://www.hmc.org.uk/blog/leading-bolton-headteacher-criticises-exam-overhaul/\">said in a statement:</a> \u201cThe quality of marking in exams is a huge issue for schools nationally.\u201d </p> <p>He added that under the new system, \u201cit will be more difficult to get marks changed when they are wrong and it does not deal with the problem that so many candidates need to appeal to get the mark they should have got in the first place\u201d.</p> <p>Russell Hobby, general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers, says that pupils\u2019 hard work demands a system that gets the marks right first time. \u201cThe way to restore confidence in exam marking is to increase transparency and rigour \u2013 not to make the appeals harder,\u201d he said. </p> <h2><strong>Follow us on Twitter via <a href=\"https://twitter.com/GuardianTeach\">@GuardianTeach</a>.

  "<p>People with dementia are being let down by local services across the country, according to new government data that critics say has revealed a postcode lottery in care for the chronic and degenerative brain disease.</p> <p>An <a href=\"https://shapeatlas.net/dementia/#6/52.9448/-2.1472/l-p65\">interactive \u201cdementia atlas\u201d</a>, published online on Tuesday by the Department of Health, shows that standards of care vary widely in different areas, with services failing to reach almost half the patients for check-ups even once a year in one area. </p> <p>Jeremy Hunt, the health secretary, said the data would \u201cshine a spotlight\u201d on the areas with the worst performance, and so drive improvements across the country.

For example, while in some parts of England, 85.8% dementia patients have their care looked at every year, in others just 49.3% receive the same service. Those checks are seen as important because, as dementia is a long-term and degenerative condition, \u201creviewing those with a diagnosis at least annually will ensure that the needs of people with dementia and their carers are discussed and appropriate care plans can be implemented\u201d, the atlas says.</p> <p>Similarly, while some areas have as many as 8,000 \u201cdementia friends\u201d available to help patients, others have none at all. There is also a more than three-fold variation in the number of those with dementia being admitted to hospital as an emergency. That ranges from 1,840 for every 100,000 people aged 65+ to as many as 6,046 for every 100,000. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/commentisfree/2015/jul/25/observer-editorial-johns-campaign-dementia-carers-hospital\">The Observer view on dementia care | Observer editorial</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cMaking more user-friendly information on dementia accessible online is a step in the right direction,\u201d said George McNamara, head of policy and public affairs at Alzheimer\u2019s Society. \u201cPeople can now see which parts of the country are leading the way with developing dementia-friendly communities, and how many dementia friends there are in each area.\u201d</p> <p>However, the atlas should be expanded to become even more useful by including the experiences people with dementia have had of the health and care systems, in order to enable NHS bosses to make improvements in areas which are lagging behind, McNamara added. </p> <p>The atlas shows that care is unsatisfactory in some places, the Alzheimer\u2019s Society added. \u201cThe atlas exposes varied care, with some areas reporting much higher numbers of emergency hospital admissions.

For example, Jim Saleam, then of National Action, was jailed in 1991 for his part in a shotgun attack upon African National Congress representative Eddie Funde, while Australian Nationalist Movement leader Jack van Tongeren spent 13 years in a Western Australian prison for arson offences. </p> <p>At other moments in time, far right groups have swung the other way, seeking to build \u201cmass parties\u201d and contest elections.

These minute groups were monitored by the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation (Asio), but were considered not much of a threat due their tiny size and \u201cpoor quality\u201d membership. The NSPA gained notoriety in the media due to its announcement that it would run candidates in the 1970 half-Senate election, but <a href=\"http://soda.naa.gov.au/record/4725001/51\">a 1972 Asio report</a> noted it stilled relied on \u201cprovocative baiting and counter-demonstration action as a means of gaining publicity\u201d.</p> <p>On the back of the infamy of the National Front in Britain during the 1970s, a small group of young and old nationalists met in Melbourne in 1978 to form the National Front of Australia. The NFA attempted to seize the initiative presented by the British NF, creating an antipodean version of the UK organisation, aimed at \u201ccontrolling the streets\u201d and then eventually contesting elections. Looking to the situation in the UK, <a href=\"http://soda.naa.gov.au/record/12793105/93\">Asio believed</a> that violence between the NFA and left-wing protest groups was likely, partly because of the NSPA background of some involved in the NFA and also because, \u201c[r]ightwing extremist groups have tended to attract violent elements whether the leadership welcomes them or not\u201d. However, the NFA never fulfilled its ambitions and was quickly wound up after contesting two Senate seats in Queensland in the 1980 federal election.</p> <p>A number of those disillusioned with the short-lived NFA defected to the National Alliance, a rival organisation than looked more to the US radical right than the UK. From the National Alliance, Jim Saleam and a few others formed National Action in 1982. This group was much more confrontational and eschewed electoral politics in favour of \u201cdirect action\u201d. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.salusjournal.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/29/2013/03/Whitford_Salus_Journal_Issue_1_Number_2_2013_pp_40-51.pdf\">Academic Troy Whitford has shown</a> that this direct action attracted the attention of Asio and the special branch of the NSW police force, who both took extensive measures to monitor and infiltrate the organisation. By the late 1980s, National Action had grown a reputation for racial violence, with <a href=\"http://apo.org.au/resource/racist-violence-report-national-inquiry-racist-violence-australia-1991\">a 1991 national inquiry into racist violence in Australia noting</a> that members of the group had been involved in intimidation of public figures that opposed racism. </p> <p>A breakaway group led by Jack von Tongeren in Perth, the Australian Nationalist Movement, took this violence further, with attacks upon those who challenged the ANM\u2019s racist posters and evolving into arson of Asian business in the Western Australian capital.</p> <p>With both Saleam and Van Tongeren jailed in the 1990s, their groups faded away even further, but many who were within the orbit of the far right were buoyed by Pauline Hanson\u2019s One Nation in the late 1990s. One Nation represented a shift for many on the far right towards electoralism and populism, with a chance of success, but while gaining a number of seats in Queensland and NSW between 1998 and 2001, the party quickly imploded. By this time, One Nation had also shed most of its supporters from the hardline far right in a relationship of mutual distrust.</p> <p><a href=\"http://arena.org.au/hanson-howard-and-the-politics-of-exhaustion/\">Many have argued</a> that the shift by the Liberals after 2001 towards the right in terms of the discourse on \u201cboat people\u201d and the \u201cwar on terror\u201d co-opted the rhetoric of the far right (and the appeal of One Nation) and toned it down for mainstream consumption.

  "<p>There is an injustice haunting exams in England, Wales and Northern Ireland. No one mentions it because no one has any clue how to solve it. Last week, however, a thought struck me. Let\u2019s see what you think.</p> <p>On Thursday, thousands of young people will log on to computers and find out their A-level grades. We already know that pupils from state schools will receive proportionately fewer top grades than those in private schools. But what most people don\u2019t know is that a bit of the exams process that happens after pupils have received their grades makes the inequity just that tiny bit worse.</p> <p>Exam grades are subject to appeal. If a school has enough cash, it can return a paper to be marked again. And tests completed by the exams watchdog, Ofqual, show that when examiners re\u2011mark they are <a href=\"http://schoolsweek.co.uk/examiners-generous-during-re-marks/\">more generous</a> than they are first time around. The presumption is they know the stakes are higher and are subconsciously more cautious.</p> <p>Hence, re-marking doesn\u2019t just buy a second spin \u2013 it buys an easier ride.</p> <p>The cost of exam appeals \u2013 about \u00a350 each \u2013 puts schools off sending back too many. Money is returned if the score is changed, but if it\u2019s not, the cash is gone. Hence, most schools are careful about which re-marks to allow. Parents and pupils have little say in the process: it is for schools to decide how many papers will be marked again.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/teacher-network/2016/aug/16/can-students-still-get-their-a-levels-re-marked\">Will students still be able to have their A-levels re-marked?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Private schools, with the ability to recoup the cost from parents via invoicing, are less affected by the cost barrier. They are more able to ask for re-marks \u2013 and they do.</p> <p>Last year, 13% of exams taken at independent schools were re-marked, compared with 8% in the state sector. Some subjects differ widely. <a href=\"http://schoolsweek.co.uk/independent-schools-challenge-twice-as-many-exam-results-than-state-schools/\">For example</a>, one in five French exam papers sat at independent schools last year were re\u2011marked. In the state sector the figure was just one in 20.</p> <p>In an attempt to limit the problem, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/may/26/gcse-a-level-exam-appeals-remarks-change-tougher-challenge-results\">Ofqual has ordered exam boards to re\u2011mark</a> in a less generous way. It makes score changes less likely so, in theory, the \u00a350 gamble is less worthwhile. But those with limited budgets are the most risk averse. As it stands, private schools \u2013 with the ability to gamble even at higher risk \u2013 are likely to continue piling in for appeals.</p> <p>Ultimately, as long as exam appeals have a price attached to them, richer schools will always have an advantage.</p> <p>So, how to solve the problem? Here\u2019s a possible solution.</p> <p>The process needs to be entirely free to schools and students, but re-marking should be allowed only if an independent person agrees it is justified. Independent assessors \u2013 teachers or examiners working as self-employed consultants \u2013 would be asked by schools or pupils to check over papers. Only if the assessor is willing to sign it through to an exam board would it be re-marked. But here\u2019s the twist: the assessor stumps up the initial \u00a350. If their punt on a re-mark is wrong, they would lose out. But, if their hunch is correct, and the exam mark is changed, they would be paid, say, \u00a3150 by the exam body. A smart assessor, with good judgment and a quick eye, could make a tidy sum.</p> <p>Exam boards will probably shriek at these payouts. But the current situation is unfair. At the moment, if schools make a wrong call, they lose \u00a350. If exam boards are wrong, they just have to pay the \u00a350 back. Sure, they re-mark the exam paper. But they should have got the job right in the first place. There needs to be a higher penalty than re-doing the job free of charge.</p> <p>Practically, the independent assessment would be easy to arrange. Exam papers are already uploaded and marked online. From next summer, one of the largest exam boards, Pearson, will share marked exam papers with students on the morning of their results. These online papers could be opened so schools can forward them to independent exam checkers who scour papers flagged for review and send through those they were willing to bet on.</p> <p>Examiners could then start re-marking immediately, speeding up the whole process. In 2014, <a href=\"http://schoolsweek.co.uk/how-long-do-a-level-exam-remarks-take-from-five-days-to-22/\">students waited</a> an average of 10 days to get the re-mark results. After that length of time university accommodation is often full and places are lost.</p> <p>From the student and school\u2019s perspective, this system has the benefit of being free. From a social justice perspective, it means everyone has the same access to a re-mark. From a cost perspective, it penalises the exam boards who mess up most.</p> <p>It\u2019s not perfect. There are kinks in the plan. But it would at least reduce the injustice we know exists yet dare not stare too hard at, lest it defeat us with its intractability. It\u2019s got to be worth a pilot study at the very least.</p>",
  "<p>Clusters of gigantic stone pine cones poke above the dense forest canopy in Cambodia, looking like ancient rocket ships poised for take-off, their distinctive silhouettes reflected in the mirror-calm moat below.

This central temple alone, built by King Suryavarman II in the early 12th century, remains the largest religious complex in the world, four times larger than Vatican City, its five conical towers rising above a 160-hectare precinct.</p> <p>As the only surviving structures in the area, it was assumed that the temples must have operated like medieval walled towns, each inhabited by staff of a few thousand people. Perhaps they had been built by successive kings, as the royal family and their retinue moved from one complex to the next, leaving a series of separate cities dotted across the plain, each bordered by a defensive moat.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"3627f0717bef599c9f2b8c3ccbf7e5e58e5d280f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3627f0717bef599c9f2b8c3ccbf7e5e58e5d280f/332_0_4980_2988/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The temple of Banteay Top, Angkor Wat\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The temple of Banteay Top \u2013 Lidar revealed details of additional temple sites and occupation areas in the vicinity of this temple.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Damian Evans</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The reality, it turns out, was nothing of the sort. The laser surveys, conducted in 2012 and 2015, revealed that these sacred walled precincts didn\u2019t contain much at all. They were instead surrounded by a sprawling urban network, a grid of boulevards, streets and canals that extended far into the surrounding landscape, covering an area larger than modern-day Paris. What archaeologists had been studying for generations was simply the equivalent of a European city with everything wiped away except for the churches and cathedrals.</p> <p>At its peak in the 12th century, when London had a population of 18,000, Angkor was home to hundreds of thousands, some estimate up to three-quarters of a million people. So what form did this megacity in the rice fields take?</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m reluctant to use the word \u2018city\u2019,\u201d says Evans. \u201cAngkor doesn\u2019t follow the usual pattern of an ancient walled city with a clearly defined edge. Instead, we discovered a very densely populated downtown urban core, covering an area of 35-40 sq km, which gradually gives way to a kind of agro-urban hinterland. It slowly dissolves into a world of neighbourhood shrines, mixed up with rice fields, market gardens and ponds.\u201d It was the prototype of modern-day suburban sprawl.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--supporting\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/maps/embed/aug/2016-08-15T16:51:12.html\" data-alt=\"Angkor locator map\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/maps/embed/aug/2016-08-15T16:51:12.html\">Angkor locator map</a> </figure>  <p>Thanks to technology developed by Nasa, all of this could be gleaned from a few hours of helicopter flight, as opposed to generations of hacking through the undergrowth with machetes (while keeping a lookout for landmines).

The scanning exposed a topography inscribed with a precise network of furrows and mounds, the bones of the city etched into the landscape.</p> <p>\u201cOn the ground you just see lumps and bumps,\u201d says Evans, \u201cbut this aerial view shows a very sophisticated system of road networks, planned neighbourhoods and intricate waterworks. Angkor was a work of geoengineering on an unparalleled scale.\u201d</p> <p>Any evidence of these neighbourhoods on the ground has long since rotted away. In Khmer society, stone was reserved exclusively for religious monuments, built of great blocks floated here from quarries 30 miles away along specially dug canals (as the <a href=\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0305440316300644\">wider laser survey revealed last year</a>).

While the watercourses evidently played a part in the sacred geography of the city, they were fundamentally there to irrigate the rice fields, the source of the empire\u2019s great wealth. Success in a tropical climate ultimately depended on the ability to mitigate flooding during the summer monsoon and store enough water to irrigate the fields during dry season \u2013 something the Khmer rulers had clearly mastered.</p> <p>Residential neighbourhoods were arranged around thousands of communal rainfall ponds, while the fields were irrigated by a pair of great reservoirs, or \u201cbarays\u201d, the whole system connected by an extensive network of canals and channels. The <a href=\"http://www.siemreapcambodia.org/angkor-temples/west-baray/\">West Baray</a>, which stretches five miles by one mile to the west of downtown Angkor, remains the largest hand-cut body of water on earth.

Yet that conveniently ignores the violent expansions of other Buddhist rulers elsewhere in the world at the time.

  "<p>Damage to the economy caused by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/eu-referendum\">Brexit </a>will more than offset the modest wage gains for British-born workers in low-paid jobs caused by cutting net migration to the tens of thousands a year, a study has found.</p> <p>A report by the Resolution Foundation thinktank said there would be a small pay increase to native-born employees in sectors such as security and cleaning if there was a big cut in the number of workers arriving in Britain from overseas.</p> <p>But it estimated that these benefits would fail to compensate for the reduction in real incomes caused in the short term by the higher inflation triggered by a falling pound, and in the long term by a slowdown in the economy\u2019s growth rate.</p> <p>The Resolution Foundation also warned that achieving the government\u2019s target of cutting annual net migration from more than 300,000 to the tens of thousands would present serious challenges for companies that rely on low-paid migrant workers \u2013 and could force some of them out of business.</p> <p>Immigration was a significant factor in the referendum campaign, with a sizeable number of those who voted to leave the EU citing it as reason for supporting Brexit. Early last month, Theresa May, then home secretary, said the government had received a clear message from the electorate and needed to control the numbers of people coming into the UK from the EU.</p> <p>But the Resolution Foundation study found that the wages of British workers in sectors most affected by migration would rise by just 0.2-0.6% by 2018, even if the government was able to hit its net migration target immediately. It noted that since the referendum the <a href=\"http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/Documents/inflationreport/2016/aug.pdf#page=37\">Bank of England</a> had cut its forecast for average earnings over the same period by two percentage points.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"caec2e2cfde45a65b9c276a4a427690a3f5349dc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/caec2e2cfde45a65b9c276a4a427690a3f5349dc/0_83_2616_1571/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A vineyard in Sussex, one of many food and drink manufacturers that rely heavily on migrant workers\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A vineyard in Sussex, one of many food and drink manufacturers that rely heavily on migrant workers.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jason Alden/Rex Features</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>While concluding that reducing net migration would have little impact on the earnings and employment prospects of British workers overall, the thinktank said a dramatic reduction in the numbers coming to Britain to work could cause \u201csevere damage\u201d to industries such as food and clothing manufacturing and domestic personnel, where more than 30% of the workforce are migrants.<br></p> <p>\u201cGoing forward, recruitment is likely to be a challenge for these sectors. Given the fact that migrants in these sectors earn a lot less than average native wages, it is unlikely that these sectors will be able to substitute migrant for native labour without rethinking their business models,\u201d it added.</p> <p>The Resolution Foundation called on the government to place these sectors at the heart of a new industrial strategy. In particular, the thinktank suggested a short-term guarantee for the right of migrant workers in these sectors to prevent a \u201cshort, sharp drop in the number of workers available for work, which could threaten the viability of some businesses\u201d.</p> <p>Beyond that it called for investment in skills and labour-saving technology to support more high-paid jobs or replace low-paid roles that could no longer be filled.</p> <p>And it suggested that a reformed migration system after Brexit was likely to be more dependent on temporary workers, which it said would require an overhaul of \u201cthe light-touch labour market enforcement regime\u201d in the UK.</p> <p>The study pointed out that there were just 350 frontline staff at three government agencies enforcing the minimum wage, employment standards and tackling gangmasters \u2013 equivalent to one officer for every 20,000 working-age migrants.</p> <p>The Resolution Foundation called for a new single labour enforcement unit that would work to prevent new forms of illegal migration, including overstaying workers, and the undercutting of pay and conditions.<br></p> <p>The thinktank\u2019s director, Torsten Bell, said the study showed the impact of migration was complicated and needed to be responded to. But he pointed out that other factors as a result of Brexit, including the potential economic downturn, would have a much bigger impact on the wages of British people.<br></p> <p>\u201cTo reduce net migration to the tens of thousands would mean cutting the numbers coming from within the EU by much more than half while simultaneously significantly reducing migration from the rest of the world,\u201d said Bell.<br></p> <p>\u201cTo achieve that you\u2019d need a very aggressive points-based system and to accept a lot less temporary labour. That would mean losing single market membership, but also accepting the same restrictions on British people working elsewhere.\u201d</p> <p>But he said the research also showed that arguments on both sides of the hotly disputed immigration debate were exaggerated. \u201cPeople who say that everybody benefits from migration automatically are wrong, but so are those who suggest ending migration will solve all our problems.\u201d</p> <p>Overall, the study found that widespread migration into the UK in recent years has had no effect on the wages of British workers, but has caused a \u201cslight drag on wages\u201d in some sectors. </p>",

Humble needs to train her to get her recognised by the <a href=\"http://www.welshsheepdogsociety.com/\">Welsh Sheepdog Society</a>, but also in a more existential way, to fulfil her very nature. \u201cI feel I owe it not only to her but to the Welsh sheepdog as a breed,\u201d she says.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"ab1987673be91b1690ee0414b51db1ba9eb22422\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ab1987673be91b1690ee0414b51db1ba9eb22422/0_88_4284_2570/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Kate's dog Teg\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Teg, who Humble says looks like \u2018a cross between David Bowie and Basil Brush\u2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Craig Morris/BBC/Tatu Pictures Ltd/Craig Morris</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>They spend several weeks training together and Teg successfully herds some sheep into a trailer. She looks pleased with herself and gets a tummy rub. Now the test \u2013 can she impress the society? Of course she can. But it\u2019s not enough to act like a Welsh sheepdog. They tell Humble that because she doesn\u2019t know her dog\u2019s parentage, Teg can\u2019t be registered. Her puppies might become official, but only if they can herd sheep, too. They might prefer the sofa.</p> <p>Undeterred, Humble turns her attention to the subplot, ambling away in the background like a wandering sheep, which is to discover, with the help of Aberystwyth University, if the Welsh sheepdog has distinct genes \u2013 if herding is in its nature rather than nurture. And it is! Teg is 75% Welsh sheepdog and a quarter border collie. The news gets better \u2013 Tango is interested. Alas, Simon still appears to be married.</p> <p>Two months later, Teg gives birth to six puppies \u2013 tiny, soft, pink little things, like mewling marshmallows. If you\u2019re the sort of person who wells up at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2011/jan/10/one-born-every-minute\">One Born Every Minute</a> (and I am), it was a treat. Five of the puppies made it but one didn\u2019t, and the shot of just its miniature paws and neat, white-tipped tail, as peacefully still as its brother and sisters were energetic, was a mournful sight.</p> <p>There was little sentimentality in <strong>One Punch Killers</strong> (C5). The number of people killed by a single punch is rising, and this documentary followed the consequences: should a fatal punch be considered murder, or the unintended split-second actions of an idiotic thug? Watching this, I swung from one to the other. With immense magnanimity, Joan has become a kind of mentor to her son\u2019s killer, Jacob. The night he killed James Hodgkinson with a single blow was \u201cjust another fight, another weekend\u201d, he says. He served 14 months in prison and says Joan saved his life \u2013 he went back to school to get his GCSEs and A-levels, and is now doing a degree in criminology. He\u2019s a young man, clearly mortified at his mindless action, who is looking to spend the rest of his life trying to make up for it.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ed9a8e16b57f592f4e43440074264602177c3f23\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ed9a8e16b57f592f4e43440074264602177c3f23/0_147_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Aaron Roach Bridgeman with Ann Bartlett\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Aaron Roach Bridgeman (presenter) with mother Ann Bartlett, whose son Kyle was killed in a drunken fight.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Channel 5</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But then there\u2019s the man who killed Robert Holland. Robert\u2019s mother, Therese, is consumed with anger and sends messages to him on Facebook saying she hopes someone close to him is murdered one day so he can feel her pain. He never responds. That\u2019s because, we find out later, he\u2019s serving another prison sentence, this time for GBH. \u201cIt\u2019s an absolute joke,\u201d says Therese. \u201cI thought he would have learned his lesson.\u201d</p> <p>It was presented by <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ARoachBridgeman?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\">Aaron Roach Bridgeman</a>, a performance poet and regular presenter on a youth TV channel, and this was aimed at a younger audience. He was a likeable, sympathetic guide \u2013 though I couldn\u2019t decide if he meant to keep referring to the light sentences for these manslaughter convictions as \u201ca slap in the face\u201d for the victims\u2019 families \u2013 but the film felt irritatingly superficial at times.</p> <p>It was the mothers who saved it. Most affecting of all was Ann, the mother of Kyle Bartlett who was killed in a drunken fight, who described turning off her son\u2019s life-support machine. She is a campaigner now, and must have told this story hundreds of times, but it can\u2019t have got any easier. The way she talked \u2013 so calm, and clear-eyed \u2013 was devastating.</p>",

It is important to work with organisers to produce schedules which meet their requirements which is what we have tried to achieve in this case.</p> <p>\u201cSpecifically with regard to the time allowed between the semi-final and final of the 100m, this has been the same in past Games where there was a world record (Atlanta).

Sports broadcasters are often criticised for ignoring female athletes but so far this Olympics, NBC has devoted 58.5% of its coverage to events involving women. That doesn\u2019t quite make up for the inequality in nearly every other sports broadcast but it\u2019s perhaps exposes the old argument that people won\u2019t tune in to watch women\u2019s sport. There are a few reasons NBC has decided to go down this road - women\u2019s gymnastics is always a huge draw, particularly this year with the brilliant Simone Biles, while American women have excelled in the pool. Then there\u2019s the viewers themselves: NBC says 55% of its audience for the Olympics is female.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5892e76add16c1070f293734ce0e433eb414f20c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5892e76add16c1070f293734ce0e433eb414f20c/0_0_5184_3558/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Yilin Fan begins the balance beam final.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"686\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Yilin Fan begins the balance beam final.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Lars Baron/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-08-15T18:56:18.417Z\">at 7.56pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57b20df3e4b062ce4d223a39\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-08-15T18:49:04.905Z\">7.49pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>So Fan Yilin starts, and looks nervous - she\u2019s a bit shaky on some of her landings, but does some very nice gear at the same time.

First middleweight Michael O\u2019Reilly was sent home after failing a drug test, then medal contender Paddy Barnes had a shock defeat in the first round of the light-fly category. Now Katie Taylor, invincible at lightweight four years ago and considered Ireland\u2019s best hope of gold, has gone out at the quarter-final stage to Finland\u2019s Mira Potkonen. This succession of failures will doubtless be blamed on the loss of head coach Billy Walsh to the US team last autumn, which caused a huge furore.

These were in the rowing, for the coxless pairs and the 4s. These two gold medals were won on the same day in an hour, on August 13. I do believe that with Max Whitlock winning his two gold medals in gymnastics yesterday (almost exactly 84 years to the day!) he becomes the first GB athlete to win those consecutive golds on the same day since Hugh Edwards. I\u2019ve not seen it reported on at all \u2013 which is not too surprising as the story of Jumbo\u2019s exploits in 1932 are not well known, he is a lot more renowned for his coaching of Oxford in the 1950s and 60s.<br></p> <p> Here is a very short biography and his <a href=\"https://www.olympic.org/en/Home/News/News/2015/05/18/21/20/25/Jumbo%20rows%20to%20victory\">exploits as a Wing Commander in World War II and rowing through a minefield to save his life</a>.</p> <p>Jumbo\u2019s story is astounding, and his two gold medals (Britain only won 4 events in 1932) were not reported on back home \u2013 other than a brief mention beside the cricket results.

He didn\u2019t. Before the race began <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/usainbolt\">Usain Bolt</a> said that the only question in his head was whether he should take it easy in the 100m final so he could spare himself for the longer sprints next week. He has his heart set, you see, on trying to break the 19 second barrier in the 200m. The big worry, Bolt explained, wasn\u2019t that this plan might make him vulnerable to his fellow competitors, but rather that it may upset his public. \u201cShould I run the 100m just to win and save my energy for the 200m?\u201d he explained. \u201cIf I shut it down in the 100, will people be happy? I don\u2019t know.\u201d He shouldn\u2019t have worried. They love him what ever he does. And no one much minded that his time of 9.81sec was his slowest in an Olympic final, and short of his own superhuman standards.</p> <p>As Bolt said, \u201cit wasn\u2019t a perfect race, but the fact is that I won, and that\u2019s what we\u2019re all here for.\u201d The sad thing was the Olympic Stadium wasn\u2019t actually full. There were some conspicuous blue blotches of empty seats in the ends behind the bends, even after Bolt himself had urged his Twitter followers to buy up tickets. But it was as close to capacity as it is going to get. By six o\u2019clock, when the hills surrounding Engenho de Dentro, were backlit brilliant red by the sunset, the queue already wound round two sides of the stadium. More fans were pouring off every train and bus out from downtown. Once they were in, they roared their appreciation for each little thing he did, giving ovations to every wink and wag of his finger.</p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/15/ever-the-entertainer-usain-bolt-plays-conductor-to-olympic-orchestra\">Read the full story here</a>.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57b16af9e4b0c23bfed8995b\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-08-15T07:15:46.619Z\">8.15am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Every gold rush needs a spark right?</strong> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/14/gb-max-whitlock-floor-gold-gymnastics-rio-olympics\">And Great Britain\u2019s yesterday was undoubtedly Max Whitlock</a>.

  "<p>As Labour nationally sinks into an internecine slough, it is easy to forget how emphatically it passed its biggest electoral test since the general election as recently as 5 May this year. Sadiq Khan\u2019s triumph over Conservative Zac Goldsmith strengthened Labour\u2019s dominance in the capital despite a heavily negative Tory campaign. </p> <p>In his first 100 days at City Hall, while assembling his team and pressing ahead with initiatives on policing, air quality and the workings of Transport for London (TfL), much of Khan\u2019s focus has been on lobbying the Conservative government for resources and devolved powers to nurture London\u2019s economy. </p> <p>The uncertainties caused by Brexit, which Khan strongly opposed, have added urgency to this: the prime minister, Theresa May, will be well aware that the UK depends heavily on London\u2019s generation of wealth and taxes. Khan, who said early in the election campaign that he intended to be \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/davehillblog/2016/jan/09/london-mayor-race-the-new-labour-flavour-of-sadiq-khan\">the most business-friendly mayor of all time</a>\u201d, has responded to the EU referendum outcome by joining with the City of London and others in a campaign to demonstrate that \u201cLondon Is Open\u201d for global trade and visitors as before.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It is now impossible to imagine anyone more suitable for his job</p> <footer> <cite>Evening Standard</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>A backdrop of the shock of Brexit in a city that voted 60% to remain and Labour\u2019s turmoil under Jeremy Corbyn may have enhanced Khan\u2019s honeymoon, with even the Evening Standard, which facilitated many of the Goldsmith campaign\u2019s attacks, declaring in a recent feature that it is now \u201cimpossible to imagine anyone more suitable\u201d for his job. </p> <p>Claims that Khan, an observant Muslim and former civil rights lawyer, had provided, in Goldsmith\u2019s word, \u201ccover\u201d to Islamist fanatics in the past, now seem as shrill as they had felt menacing at the time. Apart from calling <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/may/10/sadiq-khan-i-dont-want-ignorant-donald-trump-to-make-me-an-exception\">Donald Trump\u2019s view of Islam ignorant</a> and being the star speaker at the annual Eid event in Trafalgar Square, Khan\u2019s religion has become a background theme. Addressing the Pride in London parade and giving senior jobs to women have underlined his social liberalism. A self-declared \u201cproud feminist\u201d, he has announced an end to \u201cbody\u2013shaming\u201d adverts on the Tube and bus network. </p> <p>Soon he will need bigger achievements. This Friday\u2019s launch of a 24-hour service on two of London\u2019s underground lines is a delayed Boris Johnson policy. Khan\u2019s new \u201chopper\u201d bus fare, which will allow passengers two journeys for the price of one within a 60-minute window, will start in September, though Khan has faced claims that his pledge to freeze public transport fares for four years was misleading, as it will not, as things stand, apply to travelcards, whose prices are set by the Department for Transport. More detail about his affordable housing plans is awaited, and Londoners will soon be looking for evidence of solid progress in all key policy areas. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/public-leaders-network/2016/aug/15/sadiq-khans-first-100-days-london-mayor-brexit\">Sure-footed start but trials ahead: Sadiq Khan's first 100 days as London mayor</a> </p> </aside>  <h2><strong>Devolution</strong></h2> <p>Khan is seeking more control for the mayoralty and London\u2019s local authorities over investment in housing and transport, the running of health and social care services, skills and further education, property taxes and suburban rail services in order to use the capital\u2019s resources better. He has revived Johnson\u2019s London Finance Commission to look at further powers that might be devolved. Khan has demanded a seat for London at the Brexit negotiations, stressing the importance of continued full access to the European single market. He likes the idea of a London-only work visa for migrant workers. </p> <h2><strong>Housing</strong></h2> <p>Khan\u2019s choice of housing chief, James Murray, perturbed some commercial developers, housing associations and even other Labour boroughs, who saw the former Islington councillor as an oppositional left hardliner. However, Murray has been bringing his grasp of London\u2019s complex housing equations to bear on the practicalities of delivering more \u201cgenuinely affordable\u201d homes to rent or buy \u2013 a forthcoming more stringent definition of \u201caffordable\u201d than used by Johnson or the government \u2013 and building bridges across the housing sector.</p> <p>A manifesto goal of making 50% of all new homes \u201cgenuinely affordable\u201d has been mildly finessed into a \u201clong-term strategic target\u201d and Khan has so far declined to set a straight numerical target. But an intervention in the vast Old Oak redevelopment scheme in the west of the city to increase the affordable element planned there showed intent, and he is eager to get building on public land, notably sites owned by TfL. Persuading Jules Pipe, the mayor of Hackney, to become his planning deputy should help pull all the development threads together as Khan tries to meet soaring demand for not only homes but also schools, health facilities and transport infrastructure.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c061d02afc331ac4161156e805f5625ddc5daf3e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c061d02afc331ac4161156e805f5625ddc5daf3e/0_643_3558_4448/800.jpg\" alt=\"Val Shawcross, Khan\u2019s transport deputy, is a champion of public transport\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Val Shawcross, Khan\u2019s transport deputy, is a champion of public transport.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sarah Lee/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>Transport</strong></h2> <p>Former Labour London assembly member Val Shawcross is Khan\u2019s experienced choice as transport deputy. She has committed to introducing a long-awaited pedestrianisation scheme in Oxford Street by 2020, along with more active travel initiatives (essentially, walking and cycling). Shawcross is a champion of public transport \u2013 especially the somewhat neglected bus service \u2013 and understands the complex, some say opaque, finances of TfL, which Khan wants overhauled. </p> <h2><strong>Policing and security</strong></h2> <p>Khan countered campaign claims such as that by the defence secretary, Michael Fallon, that he was unfit to be mayor at a time of terrorist threat because he had in the past criticised British foreign policy, by proclaiming himself \u201cthe British Muslim who will take the fight to the extremists\u201d. He has welcomed the forthcoming increase in armed police patrolling London. In line with a pledge to strengthen community policing, he has vowed to introduce a second dedicated beat constable to each of London\u2019s 629 electoral wards by the end of 2017. </p> <h2><strong>Air pollution</strong></h2> <p>A consultation has been conducted on proposals for reducing the number of polluting vehicles driving in London, which has serious air quality problems. Khan has already been bolder than Johnson, producing plans that include extending and bringing forward implementation of the central London ultra low emission zone. This has pleased environmentalists, though they will watch carefully to see how far he eventually goes.</p>",
  "<p>Veganism is not the simple solution to sustainability that George Monbiot <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/09/vegan-corrupt-food-system-meat-dairy\">recently argued</a>.

Research suggests otherwise. An <a href=\"https://www.elementascience.org/articles/116/tabs/article_info\">investigation published in the US</a> last month compared 10 different eating patterns and <a href=\"http://qz.com/749443/being-vegan-isnt-as-environmentally-friendly-as-you-think/\">concluded</a> that diets incorporating some animal-source foods (especially milk and eggs) use less land than their vegan alternative. </p> <p>This is because more inclusive diets make optimal use of all existing land to feed people. That includes croplands and rangelands where grain and hay can be grown to feed livestock. A lot of meat and milk that would remain unproductive in a vegan context is produced on these marginal rangelands. For example, 60% of sub-Saharan Africa is <a href=\"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/586291468193771160/pdf/105197-WP-PUBLIC-PUBDATE-5-16-2016.pdf\">covered by drylands</a> where raising livestock is the main, and often the only, land use option available.</p> <p>Decades of research <a href=\"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2001GB001661/abstract\">have shown</a> that medium levels of livestock grazing, rather than none at all, are better for the health, productivity and biodiversity of these rangelands. When managed well, such areas also <a href=\"http://www.fao.org/docrep/018/i3437e/i3437e00.htm\">sequester large amounts of carbon</a> in their soils. </p> <p>People in high-income countries could do much to reduce their dietary impact on the world. They could moderate their intake of all foods and reducing the amount they waste, for example. <a href=\"http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/the-first-comprehensive-look-at-global-food-waste-is-as-bad-as-you-d-expect/?CID=AGR_TT_agriculture_EN_EXT\">Food waste</a> accounts for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/jan/10/half-world-food-waste\">up to 50% of total production</a> globally and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/feb/26/world-leaders-urged-to-tackle-food-waste-to-save-billions-and-cut-emissions\">7% of total greenhouse gas emissions</a>.<br></p> <p>Above all, livestock are essential to many of the world\u2019s poorest people and can\u2019t simply be cast aside. In low- and middle-income economies, where livestock account for <a href=\"ftp://ftp.fao.org/docrep/fao/010/a0701e/a0701e07.pdf\">40-60% of agricultural GDP</a>, farm animals provide livelihoods for almost <a href=\"http://www.livestockdialogue.org/fileadmin/templates/res_livestock/docs/2014_Colombia/2014_Towards_Sustainable_Livestock-dec.pdf\">1 billion people</a>, many of whom are <a href=\"http://www.fao.org/docrep/015/i2744e/i2744e00.pdf\">women</a>. Cows, goats, sheep, pigs and poultry are scarce assets for these people, bringing in regular household income, and can be sold in emergencies to pay for school or medical fees. For those who would otherwise have to subsist largely on cheap grains and tubers \u2013 risking malnutrition and stunted children \u2013 livestock can provide energy-dense, micronutrient-rich food. Animal-source foods are especially important for <a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/immpact/micronutrients/\">pregnant women, babies in their first 1,000 days of life, and young children</a>.</p> <p>When so many lives and livelihoods depend on these animals, should we really envision a scenario where an African household is denied the chance to raise a few chickens or a couple of stall-fed dairy cows? Or an Asian family is prevented from keeping a dozen pigs on a tiny plot? Or pastoralists are prevented from herding goats, sheep and cattle across drylands?</p> <p>Like any other sector, livestock production faces challenges. It is a big user of water and other natural resources, and its greenhouse gas emissions contribute to climate change. Moreover, <a href=\"http://www.livestockdialogue.org/fileadmin/templates/res_livestock/docs/2014_Colombia/2014_Towards_Sustainable_Livestock-dec.pdf\">overconsumption</a> of animal-source foods can lead to obesity and ill health; many human infectious diseases originate in livestock and other animals.

Thank you.</p> <h2>The big picture</h2> <p>Uncertainty and confusion \u2013 so what\u2019s new? \u2013 reigned again last week, over what form Brexit might take and when it might happen. The government is reportedly still more than a year away from even beginning the actual exit process. </p> <p>What with a Westminster turf war (see below) and the complete absence of any prep work for the referendum outcome, <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-britain-eu-timing-idUSKCN10O0Y9\">the Sunday Times</a> said, the situation was so chaotic that ministers are not now envisaging starting formal two-year exit talks until late next year, delaying the UK\u2019s exit until the end of 2019.</p> <p>The two new government departments created to handle Brexit and the multiple highly complex new trade deals Britain needs to negotiate are far from being fully functional, lacking basic office infrastructure \u2013 and most of their staff.</p> <p>David Davis\u2019s Department for Exiting the European Union did <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/545007/Department_for_Exiting_the_EU_-_Senior_Management_Team.pdf\">publish details of its senior management team last week</a> but has so far made only 110 of its 250 planned hires, while Liam Fox\u2019s Department for International Trade has fewer than 100 of the 500-plus negotiators it is seeking. </p> <p>Besides the critical question of Britain\u2019s readiness (or not) to trigger article 50, delaying the fatal moment until the end of next year would also \u2013 with Dutch, French and German elections all coming up \u2013 mean the government at least knows who else will be round the negotiating table. </p> <p>And the growing frustration of assorted pro-Brexiters notwithstanding, a longer delay in triggering article 50 would be no bad thing \u2013 because the UK is still nowhere near working out what kind of trade model with Europe it should seek. </p> <p>Norway dropped a bit of a bombshell on that front, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/09/norway-may-block-uk-return-to-european-free-trade-association\">raising serious questions about the feasibility</a> of one option for single market membership that was widely touted in the pro-Brexit camp running up to the referendum.</p> <p>As a member of the <a href=\"http://www.efta.int/\">European Free Trade Association</a>, Norway is part of the single market without being a member of the EU. But Elisabeth Vik Aspaker, its European affairs minister, told Aftenposten: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It\u2019s not certain that it would be a good idea to let a big country into this organisation. It would shift the balance, which is not necessarily in Norway\u2019s interests. </p> </blockquote> <p>Canadian officials, too, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/15/brexit-canada-trade-deal-eu-model-next-steps\">have confessed they are at a loss to understand</a> why their country\u2019s 1,600-page agreement with Brussels, which took seven full years to negotiate, should be seen as a potential blueprint in London:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I don\u2019t understand [the Canada deal] as the answer to Brexit when the British will be taking a 43-year step backwards in terms of the current access they have to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/eu\">European Union</a>. </p> </blockquote> <p>Whatever trade model Britain does eventually manage to agree with Europe, the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS), one of the country\u2019s leading thinktanks, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/10/uk-membership-european-single-market-worth-4-more-gdp-eu-referendum-economy\">left no one in any doubt as to what it thought would be best for the economy</a>. </p> <p>Britain could of course enjoy the same sort of access to the EU\u2019s single market on the same World Trade Organisation terms as other non-EU member states such as the US, China or India, the IFS said \u2013 but full membership of the single market is worth an additional 4% of GDP to the economy. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7cdd3ab53693e048e9254140fc517b5a184966ee\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7cdd3ab53693e048e9254140fc517b5a184966ee/0_0_5422_3615/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Canary Wharf in London\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Canary Wharf in London.

Ian Mitchell, the report\u2019s author, warned bluntly: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We still face some very big choices indeed in terms of our future relationship with the EU. There is all the difference in the world between \u2018access to\u2019 and \u2018membership of\u2019 the single market.</p> </blockquote> <p>Thankfully, though, the chancellor, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/aug/13/philip-hammond-treasury-to-guarantee-post-brexit-funding-for-eu-backed-projects\">Philip Hammond, reassured everyone who currently receives EU funding</a> that they will not \u2013 for the time being, anyway \u2013 lose out as a result of the referendum vote. <br></p> <p>Hammond said government would guarantee billions of pounds for current and pending scientific research, agricultural subsidies and \u2013 as long as they are agreed before the autumn statement \u2013 structural and investment projects . </p> <p>Campaigners including <a href=\"http://scientistsforeu.uk/2016/08/press-release-philip-hammond-guarantees-eu-funding/\">Scientists for EU welcomed the announcement but said it was a stopgap measure</a> that covered \u201cthe bare essentials, and no more\u201d. Longer term measures would be complex and critical, they added: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>After that, we must tackle the longer term issues of immigration policies, shared infrastructure and regulations, national funding, and the future relationship of the UK with the EU science programmes.</p> </blockquote> <h2>The view from Europe</h2> <p>It\u2019s August. Europe is on holiday. But a former Danish foreign minister popped up to warn \u2013 as the man who negotiated Greenland\u2019s departure from the EU after it gained autonomy from Denmark and voted to leave in 1982 \u2013 that Brexit would not be a walk in the park. <br></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-08-09/brexit-timeline-illusions-exposed-in-unusual-tale-of-greenland\">Uffe Ellemann-Jensen, now 74, told Bloomberg</a> it took Greenland, which has a population of 56,000, only one real industry (fishing) and whose laws, customs and institutions were barely entwined with the EU\u2019s at all, three years to get out: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Negotiating Greenland\u2019s exit was a fairly simple task that resulted in a relatively simple and easy to understand protocol. Britain will take much longer; it\u2019s impossible to say how long. Basically, the British need to understand what an enormous task they took upon themselves.</p> </blockquote> <h2>Meanwhile, back in Westminster</h2> <p>There\u2019s trouble at Brexit Towers and it\u2019s not just a squabble over the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jul/18/boris-johnson-forced-to-share-mansion-with-liam-fox-and-david-davis\">use of the Chevening mansion</a> shared by foreign secretary Boris Johnson, Fox and Davis. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/aug/14/liam-fox-attempt-wrest-control-foreign-office-duties-boris-johnson\">Fox made an audacious power grab</a> to bring key parts of the Foreign Office (FCO) remit under the umbrella of his new department, asking Johnson and the prime minister, Theresa May, for a restructuring to give him responsibility for economic diplomacy \u2013 a move given short shrift by No 10 and the FCO, which has nonetheless agreed to second some expert staff to the new department. </p> <p>That capped off an embarrassing week for Fox\u2019s department. On Friday, it hastily removed from its website a press release published \u201cin error\u201d that appeared to announce that the UK would still trade with the EU under WTO rules after leaving the bloc, \u201cuntil any new trade deals are negotiated\u201d. <br></p> <p>Economists quickly pointed out that such a move would be hugely damaging for businesses, who would be subject to steep tariffs on goods exported to the EU \u2013 including a 10% duty on cars and 12% on clothing \u2013 and would have no access to the EU\u2019s service or financial service markets. </p> <p>Meanwhile, Jeremy Corbyn remains streets ahead in nominations for the Labour party leadership, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/aug/15/jeremy-corbyn-wins-backing-84-per-cent-local-labour-parties\">taking 84% of local party nominations</a> and endorsements from the UK\u2019s two largest unions. </p> <p>One group whose support he has not won, however, is the Labour Movement for Europe, chaired by the former party leader Neil Kinnock. The Labour affiliate nominated Corbyn\u2019s rival Owen Smith by 10 to one.<br><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/aug/15/neil-kinnock-condemns-corbyn-for-silence-or-ignorance-over-brexit\">In an article for the Guardian, Kinnock accused the Labour leader</a> of \u201cignorance, lack of concern, or willingness to let the Tory Brexiters run amok\u201d, and said he believed the referendum result could have been different if a Labour leader had made a passionate case for remain. </p> <p>Kinnock said Labour needed a leader who was \u201cup to the task\u201d of having a key role in shaping the UK\u2019s relations with the EU.

A record 64,300 students found places through clearing last year, of whom 15,000 were new applicants who had not previously registered with Ucas.</p> <p>And the lifting of the student numbers cap last year \u2013 along with the introduction of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2013/aug/12/a-level-results-better-than-expected-adjustment\">the \u201cadjustment\u201d system</a>, which allows students to trade up to a different course or university if their grades exceed their firm choice offer \u2013 gives more students the opportunity to consider new, and sometimes surprising, opportunities.</p> <p>When A-level results are published on Thursday, applicants will find some exciting new courses and modern twists on traditional subjects on offer.</p> <p>To attract students and satisfy the demands of 21st-century employers, universities are putting far more emphasis on student satisfaction and work-ready skills. Vocational subjects scorned as \u201cMickey Mouse\u201d degrees less than a decade ago now have some of the best graduate employment rates.</p> <p>Birmingham\u2019s applied golf management BSc has 100% of its students in jobs six months after graduation, as does the BA Hons in animation and visual effects at Sheffield Hallam University. And employers are actively seeking out graduates from Bournemouth University\u2019s retail degree, says Martin Birchall, managing director of High Fliers Research, a graduate recruitment research company.</p> <p>Joint degrees are offering work-related combinations such as psychology and business at Aston or drama and business studies at Loughborough. And the UK\u2019s first insurance degree \u2013 developed by the University of Chichester and brokers Be Wiser \u2013 is being launched next month. Students work for the company with a starting salary of \u00a318,000 and get time off and their fees paid to study at Peter Symonds College in Winchester for the BA Hons degree.</p> <p>Meanwhile, many universities are moving towards cross-disciplinary courses with more joint honours and integrated study or work abroad.</p> <p>Liberal arts and science has slipped across the Atlantic from the US and is springing up at universities across the UK, including Birmingham and Surrey. The degrees offer students the opportunity to mix and match different subjects rather than specialising in one or two. Students at University College London, for example, can take a minimum of three courses ranging from creative writing, qualitative thinking or law in action to engineering design, energy systems and methodologies of drawing.</p> <p>University of Surrey student Laura Richter says she chose its liberal arts and science degree because she wanted to carry on with several subjects. \u201cI liked psychology, languages and humanities, and I didn\u2019t want to choose one and then find two years down the line it wasn\u2019t for me,\u201d she says. \u201cEveryone gets together from the different modules, and we bring our different skills and approaches to problems and scenarios.\u201d Her main subjects are psychology and modern languages.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2015/aug/10/choosing-your-university-course-during-clearing-pick-a-passion\">Choosing your university course during Clearing: pick a passion</a> </p> </aside>  <p>New subjects can often be found in clearing before they become better known and established. Bristol, for example, is offering places for its suite of four-year \u201cinnovation\u201d integrated undergraduate and master\u2019s degrees \u2013 which include computer science with innovation, film and television with innovation, and history with innovation \u2013 being launched this September. The innovation part of the degree course covers enterprise, venture creation and entrepreneurship.</p> <p>So what do employers think about these new courses? For 70% of graduate jobs, it doesn\u2019t matter, says Birchall. In fact, some employers are seeking graduates who follow less traditional routes. \u201cThe big law firms keep half their places open to people who study subjects other than law because they want people with diverse experience. So it may be that students stand just as good a chance, or even better, by doing well in a subject they really enjoy rather than one they think will impress employers,\u201d he says.</p> <p>The reputation of an institution is important, but some lower down the university rankings are respected by employers for their excellence in different sectors, he adds .</p> <p>Richter has found employers are open-minded about her degree choice. When she was applying for a psychology work placement this year, she found employers did not know about liberal arts degrees but were \u201cintrigued to find out more about them\u201d.</p> <p>Gareth Hughes, the research lead for student wellbeing at the University of Derby, says he sees parents who are worried when their children want to study subjects such as pop music or music technology \u2013 but both courses have good employment prospects.</p> <p>Today\u2019s universities are trying to meet employers\u2019 needs through innovative courses but they are also preparing young people for jobs in the future that we cannot foresee, he says. \u201cA degree isn\u2019t a job training programme. If you engage with it, then a degree in any subject will give you the same set of skills and build you up as a person.\u201d</p> <p>The problem for universities branching out into this brave new world of innovative degrees is that parents and teachers \u2013 the people who teenagers turn to for advice \u2013 are likely to favour what they know and trust. Even Mary Curnock Cook, chief executive of Ucas, admits that she may have given the wrong advice a few years ago when her three children were applying.</p> <p>\u201cI remember just wanting my kids to choose something \u2018normal\u2019 at a university I recognised, so I could relax,\u201d she says. \u201cNow I\u2019d tell parents to resist this urge and allow your children to make their choices for a 21st-century future.\u201d</p> <h2>Unusual options \u2013 from cartoons to Klingon<br></h2> <p>Looking for something a little out of the ordinary?

Podiatry is not up there in the headlines, yet what\u2019s going on in that unglamorous zone is an alarming microcosm of the downward path of the health service.

As <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/jul/21/nhs-england-bosses-launch-reset-plan-tackle-deficit-financial-special-measures\">debts pass \u00a32.5bn</a>, the NHS feels the tightening financial tourniquet.</p> <p>Now look at it through the prism of just one small corner, as seen from the feet up. Every week <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/jul/15/rise-diabetes-amputations-figures\">135 people have amputations</a> because diabetes has caused their feet to rot: their circulation goes and then the sensation in their feet, so they don\u2019t notice damage done by rubbing shoes, stubbed toes or stepping on nails. Minor injuries turn into ulcers that if left untreated turn gangrenous, and so the toes, then the foot, then the leg are lost \u2013 horrific life-changing damage. Numbers are rising fast, with nearly three million diabetics. The scandal is that 80% of these amputations are preventable \u2013 if there were the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/apr/27/diabetics-amputation-risks-nhs-foot-checks-missed-diabetes-uk\">podiatrists to treat the first signs</a> of foot ulcers. But the numbers employed and in training are falling.</p> <p>In his surgery, the head of podiatry for Solent NHS Trust, Graham Bowen, is unwrapping the foot of a lifelong diabetic to reveal a large missing chunk of heel, a great red hole nearly through to the bone. This man has already had some toes amputated. He has been having treatment with maggots, bandaged into his wound to eat the dead skin and help healing \u2013 and he is slowly improving. Everyone Bowen sees now is at similarly high risk. \u201cOn the NHS we\u2019re essentially firefighting the worst cases now,\u201d says Bowen. \u201cWe are going through our lists and discharging all the rest of our patients.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"472f2446320afbc13c33d4f0b86b4a41719621bd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/472f2446320afbc13c33d4f0b86b4a41719621bd/0_668_3600_4500/800.jpg\" alt=\"Carer helping elderly man\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018On a 15-minute visit carers can\u2019t check feet.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andrew Bret Wallis/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But not even all these acute patients get the same optimal treatments, due to the vagaries of the 2012 NHS Act. Solent, a community trust that covers mental health and a host of other services, is used by five different clinical commissioning groups (CCGs), including Southampton, Portsmouth and West Hampshire. Each has its own criteria for what it will pay for, and each is toughening those criteria. Depending on their address, some patients get the very best, others only get what their cash-strapped CCG pays for.</p> <p>You need to know about diabetic feet to understand the difference in treatments: the conventional and cheapest treatment is a dressing and a removable plastic boot, and telling patients to keep their foot up for months. But patients who can\u2019t feel their feet tend to take off the boot and hobble to make a quick cup of tea. \u201cTen minutes of putting pressure on the ulcer undoes 23 hours of resting it,\u201d Bowen says, so it takes 52 weeks on average to heal ulcers that way. For \u00a3500 extra, a new instant fibreglass cast saves any pressure on ulcers and cures them within eight weeks.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/aug/16/the-funding-shortfall-that-hobbles-the-nhs\">The funding shortfall that hobbles the NHS | Letters</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Although the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence says this total-contact cast is the gold standard, most of Bowen\u2019s CCGs won\u2019t pay for it. I watched him putting one on a patient in under half an hour: after nine weekly replacements, that ulcer would be completely healed. For every 10 of the new casts, one amputation is prevented \u2013 and each amputation costs the NHS \u00a365,000. Such is the madness of NHS fragmentation, divided between multiple commissioners and providers, all in serious financial trouble, that no one spends a bit more now for others to save later, even when the payback is so quick.</p> <p>This clinic lost four podiatry posts to save money: though diabetic numbers soar, its budget has been static for five years. \u201cDoing more for less,\u201d he says with the same weary sigh you hear echoing through the NHS. As Bowen goes through the clinic\u2019s books removing all but the most acute cases, he turns away diabetics whose problems should be caught early. He turns away others he used to treat: the old and frail who have become immobile due to foot problems; the partially sighted or people with dementia who have poor home care. On a 15-minute visit carers can\u2019t check feet and find out if they are the reason someone doesn\u2019t get out of bed, toes buckled in, leaving them needlessly incapacitated and heading for residential care sooner than necessary.</p> <p>What happens to those he takes off his books? \u201cThey have to go private, if they can afford it. If not, then nothing.\u201d He used to send them to Age UK, but lack of funds shut that service. Only 5% of podiatry is now done by the NHS so Bowen has set up TipToe, a private practice attached to his NHS clinic. It\u2019s not what he wants, but it keeps prices low and all proceeds go to the NHS.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Next year podiatry trainees, like nurses, will no longer get state bursaries, so fewer will apply</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Alarm bells should ring here: how silently the NHS slides into the private sector. Labour leadership contender Owen Smith has flagged up his team\u2019s research showing private practice has <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/aug/15/owen-smith-tories-nhs-privatisation-labour-leadership\">doubled since 2010</a>. Now that many CCGs only pay for one cataract, how many go private for the second eye? As the Guardian\u2019s health policy editor, Denis Campbell, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/aug/15/creeping-privatisation-nhs-official-data-owen-smith-outsourcing\">has asked</a>, how many more vital treatments will go this way?</p> <p>Podiatry is the ground floor of the NHS hierarchy. The profession reckons the NHS in England needs 12,000 practitioners but only has about 3,000 \u2013 and that\u2019s falling, despite so many high-risk diabetics needing weekly appointments. Next year podiatry trainees, like nurses, will no longer receive state bursaries, so fewer will apply. They tend to be older, with families, unable to take on a \u00a345,000 debt for a job paying around \u00a335,000 per year. Already student places have been cut by nearly a quarter in five years. Most of the 7,000 amputations a year are preventable. A shocking statistic: half of those who undergo amputations will die within two years.</p> <p>Only in the details of what\u2019s happening on the frontline can we understand the daily reality of Britain\u2019s shrinking state. Step back and ask how it can be that a country still growing richer can afford less quality care than when it was poorer? Is that the country\u2019s choice? As the NHS slides into the private sector, here is yet another public service in retreat.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 18 August 2016 to remove a reference to small ulcers no longer receiving treatment on the NHS. They do. The NHS no longer treats lower risk diabetics. It used to.<br></p>",

Because of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.co.uk/business/2015/may/21/temporary-and-part-time-jobs-surge-promotes-inequality-says-oecd\" rel=\"nofollow\">rise in temporary contracts</a>, the UK also provides less on-the-job training. \u201cThis means employees feel less valued and, because workers aren\u2019t as well-trained, the overall productivity and efficiency of the workforce drops,\u201d adds Polaski.<br></p> <p>The resulting lack of job security leads to unproductive workers, argues neuroscientist and productivity coach Magdalena Bak-Maier. \u201cUnderneath the statistics, there is a sense of uncertainty and fear. People feel insecure in terms of their employment and low wages.

That kind of big brother control can be highly draining,\u201d adds Bak-Maier.<br></p> <p>Obviously, this new kind of working requires a lot of trust from bosses. At the moment there\u2019s such fear from managers that people will use the time badly, says Bak-Maier. \u201cBut in the UK as productivity is plummeting, we desperately need a culture shift. Companies need to put the focus on results, not presenteeism.\u201d</p> <p>Office design may also be harming UK productivity. \u201cOffices are set up by extroverts for extroverts; they don\u2019t cater for people who need quiet places to focus,\u201d says Graham Allcott, founder of Think Productive.

  "<p>England\u2019s nature watchdog is planning to use its legal powers less and risks becoming a weak regulator forced to raise funding from the private companies it is meant to keep in check, <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://energydesk.greenpeace.org/2016/08/16/leaked-documents-reveal-plan-rein-englands-nature-watchdog/\">leaked documents</a> and sources reveal.</p> <p>Natural England is duty-bound to defend rare species and protected areas including national parks and England\u2019s 4,000 sites of special scientific interest from potentially environmentally damaging developments.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>But the regulator faces a budget cut of 27% and a reduction in headcount of 20% by 2020 due to cuts to the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra). This means it will have a \u201csignificantly reduced national capacity\u201d, it admits.</p> <p>A internal document from June, seen by Greenpeace and shared with the Guardian, says the agency will \u201cmake more proportionate use of our regulatory powers\u201d and \u201cretain our regulatory powers but will use them more proportionately and more efficiently, while increasingly operating through advice and partnership.\u201d </p> <p>Internal sources say this amounts to using its powers less and to agreements that \u201ccompromise wildlife\u201d.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>A source at the regulator told the Guardian: \u201cStepping back and not using regulation so often is basically saying: we won\u2019t regulate if people break the law, or persecute a species or destroy habitats, we will never take them to court.<br></p> <p>\u201cIf people see us as a weak regulator, then they will take advantage of that.

It believes the regulator is in breach of its duties under European habitats and birds directives.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Martin Harper, the RSPB\u2019s conservation director, said: \u201cNature is in trouble \u2013 and so it is vital that we have a strong and effective statutory nature conservation agency able to do whatever nature needs. <br></p> <p>\u201cNatural England has already been subject to huge reductions in its capacity to do its vital job, and the current political context means that it has increasingly moved away from using the full range of tools available to protect and restore nature.\u201d<br></p> <p>Stephen Trotter, the director of the Wildlife Trusts, a network of 47 local groups, said: \u201cWe have for some time seen evidence across the trusts of less engagement with planning issues by Natural England than would have been the case previously. We find that particularly around non-designated but local wildlife sites, it has a reluctance to get involved in defending those sites.\u201d<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Other changes to the way the agency operates include providing \u201cadvice to government that is politically aware\u201d. The regulator is meant to provide science-based and independent advice. A source at Natural England said the idea was \u201cridiculous\u201d as its advice was meant to be \u201cbased on the science, not on anything else\u201d.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>The watchdog\u2019s ecologists will also get out less to see the wildlife and habitats they are meant to protect and understand.<br></p> <p>\u201cFewer ad hoc site visits will be necessary because more information, data and evidence about sites and the local area will be captured remotely and by others,\u201d says the document. Conservationists warned earlier this year that Natural England risked losing its \u201ceyes and ears\u201d after it <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/mar/06/decision-to-end-funding-of-local-environmental-record-centres-attacked-natural-england-data-collection-contract\">cut funding for local environmental record centres</a>.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>In order to raise more money as its budget is cut \u00a330m by the end of 2020 on 2015-16 levels, the agency also plans to raise more money by charging the private sector, such as water companies, housebuilders and windfarm developers, for its services. It raised \u00a31.43m in 2015-16 by charging \u00a3110 an hour for such services, and hopes to increase this to \u00a312m a year by 2020.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s blurring the vision of what we do,\u201d a source at Natural England said. \u201cIt\u2019s commercialising something that\u2019s very hard to commercialise. People find it quite a conflict in what they do. Previously we would prioritise what is important in terms of biodiversity rather than profit, so it\u2019s quite a different mindset.\u201d<br></p> <p>The agency tried to allay such fears in another document shared with staff. \u201cThere were some concerns that a move towards charging might be perceived as a shift towards \u2018supporting development\u2019, with us working for, rather than with, our customers. Thankfully, that criticism has rarely been directed at us,\u201d it said.<br></p> <p>Hannah Martin of the Greenpeace Brexit response team said: \u201cFirst, we had the <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/may/30/brexit-spirit-crushing-green-directives-minister-george-eustice\">environment minister calling EU environmental protections \u2018spirit-crushing\u2019</a> during the referendum campaign.

  "<p>The Republican party, its leaders like to say, is a party of ideas. Debates over budgets and government programmes are important, but they must be conducted with an eye on the bigger questions \u2013 questions about the character of the state, the future of freedom and the meaning of virtue. These beliefs provide the foundation for a conservative intellectual establishment \u2013 thinktanks such as the American Enterprise Institute, magazines such as National Review, pundits such as George Will and Bill Kristol \u2013 dedicated to advancing the right\u2019s agenda.</p> <p>Over the last year, that establishment has been united by one thing: opposition to Donald Trump. Republican voters may have succumbed to a temporary bout of collective insanity \u2013 or so Trump\u2019s critics on the right believe \u2013 but the party\u2019s intelligentsia remain certain that entrusting the Republican nomination to a reality television star turned populist demagogue has been a disaster for their cause and their country. Whatever Trump might be, he is not a conservative.</p> <p>That belief is comforting, but it is wrong. Trump is a unique character, but the principles he defends and the passions he inflames have been part of the modern American right since its formation in the aftermath of the second world war. Most conservative thinkers have forgotten or repressed this part of their history, which is why they are undergoing a collective nervous breakdown today.

While keepers of the conservative flame in Washington and New York repeatedly proclaimed that Trump could never win the Republican nomination, in February a small group of anonymous writers from inside the conservative movement launched a blog that championed \u201cTrumpism\u201d \u2013 and attacked their former allies on the right, who were determined to halt its ascent. In recognition of the man who inspired it, they called their site the<a href=\"http://jagrecovered.blogspot.co.uk/\"> Journal of American Greatness.</a></p> <p>Writing under pseudonyms borrowed from antiquity, such as <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decius\">\u201cDecius\u201d</a>, the masked authors described the site, called JAG by its fans, as the \u201cfirst scholarly journal of radical #Trumpism\u201d. Posts analysing the campaign with titles such as The Twilight of Jeb! alternated with more ambitious forays in philosophy such as Paleo-Straussianism, Part I: Metaphysics and Epistemology. More intellectually demanding than the typical National Review article, the style of their prose also suggested writers who were having fun. Disquisitions on Aristotle could be followed by an emoji mocking the latest outraged responses to Trump.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2016/sep/02/the-dark-history-of-donald-trumps-rightwing-revolt-podcast\">The dark history of Donald Trump's rightwing revolt \u2013 podcast</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The authors at JAG were not all backing Trump himself \u2013 officially, they were \u201celectorally agnostic\u201d \u2013 but they were united by their enthusiasm for Trumpism (as they put it, \u201cfor what Trumpism could become if thought through with wisdom and moderation\u201d). They dismissed commentators who attributed Trump\u2019s victory to his celebrity, arguing that a campaign could not resonate with so many voters unless it spoke to genuine public concerns.</p> <p>JAG condensed Trumpism into three key elements: economic nationalism, controlled borders and a foreign policy that put American interests first.</p> <p>These policies, they asserted, were a direct challenge to the views of America\u2019s new ruling class \u2013 a cosmopolitan elite of wealthy professionals who controlled the commanding heights of public discourse. This new ruling class of \u201ctransnational post-Americans\u201d was united by its belief that the welfare of the world just happened to coincide with programmes that catered to its own self-interest: free trade, open borders, globalisation and a suite of other policies designed to ease the transition to a post-national future overseen by enlightened experts. In the language of JAG, they are the \u201cDavoisie\u201d, a global elite that is most at ease among its international peers at the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/jan/21/-sp-davos-guide-world-economic-forum\">World Economic Forum</a> in Davos and totally out of touch with ordinary Americans.</p> <p>Mainstream conservatives and their liberal counterparts were equally complicit in sustaining this regime, but JAG focused its attention on the right. Leading Republican politicians and the journalists who fawned over them in the rightwing press were pedlars of an \u201cintellectually bankrupt\u201d doctrine whose obsessions \u2013 cutting taxes, policing sexual norms, slashing government regulation \u2013 distracted from \u201cthe fundamental question\u201d Trump had put on the agenda: \u201cdestruction of the soulless managerial class\u201d.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>A dissenting minority has been waging a guerrilla war against the conservative establishment for three decades</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>JAG unleashed salvo after salvo against \u201cConservatism Inc\u201d, the network of journals and thinktanks that, along with talk radio and Fox News, has made defending the party of ideas into a lucrative career path. \u201cIf Trump ends up destroying the Republican party,\u201d they wrote, \u201cit is because the Republican party, as it exists today, is little more than a jobs programme for failed academics and journalists.\u201d</p> <p>News of JAG began circulating on the right shortly after its debut early in the primary season. \u201cThe first time I heard someone refer to it, I thought it was a joke,\u201d says former George W Bush speechwriter David Frum. But it quickly found an audience. \u201cThey got a huge response almost immediately,\u201d says conservative activist Chris Buskirk, who recalled excited emails and frantic texting among his colleagues. In June, the Wall Street Journal columnist and former Ronald Reagan speechwriter Peggy Noonan alerted her readers to the \u201csophisticated, rather brilliant and anonymous website\u201d. A link from the popular rightwing website Breitbart News drove traffic even higher, and JAG seemed poised to shape the discussion over the future of conservatism.</p> <p>Then it disappeared. Months of posts, totalling more than 175,000 words, were scrubbed from the internet, replaced by <a href=\"http://journalofamericangreatness.blogspot.co.uk/\">a note labelling the site an \u201cinside joke\u201d </a>that had spiralled out of control. Within the right, rumours swirled about the real motives behind the vanishing act; fans of JAG took its self-immolation as further evidence that the conservative establishment would not tolerate any dissent. But the brief life of the Journal of American Greatness did more than provide grist for feverish speculation on Twitter. Patrolling the boundaries of acceptable thought on the right has always been one of the central duties of the conservative intellectual, and JAG\u2019s voluntary purging was the latest chapter in a long battle to define the meaning of conservatism.</p> <p>Conservatives tend to portray their cause as the child of a revolt against the liberal status quo that began in the aftermath of the second world war, gained momentum in the 1950s when a cohort of intellectuals supplied the right with its philosophical underpinning, attained political consciousness in Barry Goldwater\u2019s 1964 presidential campaign, and won vindication with Ronald Reagan\u2019s election to the White House. Ideas have consequences, they proclaimed. Just look at us.</p> <p>But there is another way of interpreting the history of the American right, one that puts less emphasis on the power of ideas and more on power itself \u2013 a history of white voters fighting to defend their place in the social hierarchy, politicians appealing to the prejudices of their constituents so they can satisfy the wishes of their donors, and the industry that has turned conservatism into a billion-dollar business.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--immersive\" data-media-id=\"ae7d7b44419c18020b88dc87a97c874e7ed3802a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ae7d7b44419c18020b88dc87a97c874e7ed3802a/0_168_5100_3060/1000.jpg\" alt=\"White segregationist demonstrators protesting at the admission of the Little Rock Nine, to Central High School, 1959\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">White segregationist demonstrators protesting in Little Rock, Arkansas, in 1959.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Universal History Archive/UIG via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This is the explanation preferred by leftwing critics, who typically regard the Republican party as a coalition fuelled by white nationalism and funded by billionaires. But this line of attack also has a long history on the right, where a dissenting minority has been waging a guerrilla war against the conservative establishment for three decades. Now the unlikely figure of Donald Trump has brought in a wave of reinforcements \u2013 over 13 million in the primaries alone. Their target is the managerial elite, and their history begins in the run-up to the second world war, when a forgotten founder of modern American conservatism became a public sensation with a book that announced the dawning of a civilisation ruled by experts.</p> <h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> <p>The Managerial Revolution: What Is Happening in the World was the most unlikely bestseller of 1941. The author, James Burnham, was a philosophy professor at New York University who until the previous year had been one of Leon Trotsky\u2019s most trusted counsellors in the US. Time called Burnham\u2019s work a grim outline of \u201cthe totalitarian world soon to come\u201d that was \u201cas morbidly fascinating as a textbook vivisection\u201d.</p> <p>The son of a wealthy railway executive, Burnham graduated near the top of his class in Princeton in 1927 before studying at Oxford and then securing his post at NYU. But the Great Depression radicalised him, and he began a double life, lecturing on Aquinas by day and polemicising against capital by night. By 1940, Burnham had lost his faith in the revolution of the proletariat. While Trotsky denounced his erstwhile disciple as an \u201ceducated witch doctor\u201d, Burnham started work on the book that would justify his apostasy.</p> <p>According to Burnham, Marxists were right to anticipate capitalism\u2019s imminent demise but wrong about what would come next. Around the turn of the 20th century, he claimed, the scale of life had changed. Population growth surged, immense corporations gobbled up smaller rivals, and government officials struggled to expand their powers to match the growing size of the challenges they faced.</p> <p>These structural changes fundamentally altered the distribution of power in society. In the 18th century, authority had rested with aristocrats; in the 19th century with capitalists; in the 20th century it had passed on to the managers, whose authority derived from their unique ability to operate the complex institutions that now dominated mass society.</p> <p>Technocrats had become the new ruling class. According to Burnham, fascism, Stalinism and Franklin D Roosevelt\u2019s New Deal were all products of this transformation, and there was no use struggling against the world that was coming into being \u2013 a world where state ownership of the means of production had become the norm, where sovereignty had shifted to a bureaucratic elite, and where the globe was divided into rival superstates.</p> <p>Burnham was not the first to foresee a society run by managers, but the arguments he borrowed from others took on a different meaning when brought together in this form. His sweep was global, his narrative reached back centuries, and he almost seemed to welcome a totalitarian future. For Burnham, the only sensible response to the managerial revolution was to recognise that it had occurred and accept there was no point in trying to bring back a world that was already lost. This bleak forecast captured the public imagination. Fortune called it \u201cthe most debated book published so far this year\u201d and it went on to sell more than 200,000 copies.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--immersive\" data-media-id=\"aa3e0ba00d4ccf09fa0677b95894a780e68dac59\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/aa3e0ba00d4ccf09fa0677b95894a780e68dac59/0_115_1992_1195/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Richard C Levin with William F Buckley Jr, Yale University, 2000\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">William F Buckley Jr collects an honorary doctorate from Yale University, 2000.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bob Child/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But Burnham quickly moved on to new territory. His true subject, he concluded, was power, and to understand power he needed a theory of politics. Marx had been his guiding influence in The Managerial Revolution; now he turned to Machiavelli, constructing the genealogy of a political theory that began with the author of The Prince and continued into the present.</p> <p>For a Machiavellian, Burnham wrote, politics was an unending war for dominance: democracy was a myth, and all ideologies were thinly veiled rationalisations for self-interest. The great mass of humanity, in Burnham\u2019s dark vision, would never have any control over their own lives. They could only hope that clashes between rival elites might weaken the power of the ruling class and open up small spaces of freedom.</p> <p>Burnham\u2019s newfound zeal for defending freedom led him, in 1955, to a conservative magazine called National Review, and to the magazine\u2019s charismatic young founder, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/27/business/media/27cnd-buckley.html?_r=0\">William F Buckley Jr</a>. Buckley\u2019s goal was to turn a scattered collection of reactionaries into the seeds of a movement. His journal set out to make the right intellectually respectable, stripping it of the associations with kooks and cranks that allowed liberals to depict it as a politics for cave-dwellers who had not reconciled themselves to modernity. Burnham was there at the start, one of five senior editors on the masthead of the first issue.</p> <p>Soon Burnham was Buckley\u2019s ranking deputy. But in an editorial staff riven by abstract debates between ardent libertarians and devout Christians, Burnham was the pragmatist who urged his colleagues not to ask politicians for more than the electorate would accept. For the right to win over working-class voters, Burnham argued, the movement had to embrace a more populist economic policy \u2013 contrary to the wishes of his anti-statist colleagues and their corporate backers, who wanted to lower taxes on the rich and roll back the welfare state. \u201cMuch of conservative doctrine,\u201d Burnham wrote in 1972, \u201cis, if not quite bankrupt, more and more obviously obsolescent.\u201d Less than a decade later, Ronald Reagan was president, and it was Burnham who seemed like a relic of the past.</p> <h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> <p>For a long time, the only major study of Burnham\u2019s work was a slim volume published in 1984 by a minor academic press under the title Power and History. The book\u2019s author, Samuel Francis, seemed a typical product of the insurgent conservative movement Burnham had helped to create \u2013 though by the late 1990s, when Francis published an updated version of Power and History, it made more sense to speak of a new conservative establishment. Outsiders who arrived at the White House with Reagan had become senior executives in Conservatism Inc. With the end of the cold war, the right had lost the glue that had bound its coalition, but there were still battles to be waged, and the money was better than ever.</p> <p>Francis was never going to become a star in the emerging rightwing infotainment complex. Shy and overweight, with teeth stained from smoking, he had difficulty making it through cocktail parties. After completing a PhD in British history at the University of North Carolina, Francis left academia for Washington \u2013 first working at a rightwing thinktank, then serving as an aide to a Republican senator, and finally joining the editorial staff of the capital\u2019s influential conservative daily newspaper, the Washington Times.</p> <p>Francis retained his academic interests while he ascended into the ranks of the conservative establishment. He published six books in his lifetime, but he worked in private on one massive volume that he hoped would bring together all the disparate strands of his thought. Finished in 1995 but not discovered until after his death a decade later, the result was published earlier this year under the title Leviathan and Its Enemies. It is a sprawling text, more than 700 pages long, digressive, repetitive and in desperate need of an editor.</p> <p>It is also one of the most impressive books to come out of the American right in a generation \u2013 and the most frightening. It is a searching diagnosis of managerial society, written by an author looking for a strategy that could break it apart.</p> <p>Like much of Francis\u2019s writing, Leviathan and Its Enemies began with Burnham \u2013 in this case, quite literally. \u201cThis book,\u201d Francis announced in the first sentence, \u201cis an effort to revise and reformulate the theory of the managerial revolution as advanced by James Burnham in 1941.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Paleoconservatives depicted themselves as spokesmen for the forgotten residents of flyover country</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Francis agreed that society had been taken over by managers, but he believed the new ruling class was far more vulnerable than Burnham had realised. Not everyone had benefited from the rise of the experts \u2013 and Francis saw this unequal distribution of rewards as the managerial regime\u2019s greatest weakness.</p> <p>For reasons he never quite explained, he insisted that the cosmopolitan elite threatened the traditional values cherished by most Americans: \u201cmorality and religion, family, nation, local community, and at times racial integrity and identity\u201d. These were sacred principles for members of a new \u201cpost-bourgeois proletariat\u201d drawn from the working class and the lower ranks of the middle class. Lacking the skills prized by technocrats, but not far enough down the social ladder to win the attention of reformers, these white voters considered themselves victims of a coalition between the top and bottom against the middle.</p> <p>According to Francis, this cohort had supplied the animating spirit of rightwing politics since the death of Franklin Roosevelt in 1945. They had supported Goldwater \u2013 but Francis regarded Goldwater\u2019s programme, like the \u201cmovement conservatism\u201d of the National Review, as a \u201cquaintly bourgeois\u201d throwback to the oligarchic politics of the 19th century, with nothing to offer the modern working man. Their tribune was not Goldwater but <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/1998/09/14/us/george-wallace-segregation-symbol-dies-at-79.html?pagewanted=all\">George Wallace</a>, the notorious segregationist and Democratic governor of Alabama \u2013 who won five southern states as an anti-civil rights third-party candidate in the 1968 presidential election. Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan had appealed to this group, too, but neglected their interests after taking office. Despite having elected multiple presidents, the post-bourgeois proletariat had yet to find a voice.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--immersive\" data-media-id=\"b9f9fe228b411a3f9b75c94215a7aaa10509c370\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b9f9fe228b411a3f9b75c94215a7aaa10509c370/76_16_2917_1750/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Third-party presidential candidate George Wallace campaigns in Boston, 1968\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Third-party presidential candidate George Wallace campaigns in Boston, 1968.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Yet Francis had difficulty explaining why managerial society would generate so much opposition in the first place. In Leviathan and Its Enemies, he argued that resistance to the cosmopolitan elite would be driven by \u201cimmutable elements of human nature\u201d that \u201cnecessitate attachment to the concrete and historical roots of moral values and meaning\u201d.</p> <p>He was more candid in a speech he gave while working on the book. \u201cWhat we as whites must do,\u201d he declared, \u201cis reassert our identity and our solidarity, and we must do so in explicitly racial terms through the articulation of a racial consciousness as whites.\u201d Where mainstream conservatives depicted the US as a nation whose diverse population was linked by devotion to its founding principles, Francis viewed it as a racial project inextricably bound up with white rule. The managerial revolution jeopardised this racial hierarchy, and so it must be overthrown.</p> <p>Francis delivered his remarks on racial consciousness at a conference organised by <a href=\"http://www.amren.com/\">American Renaissance</a>, an obscure journal devoted to promoting white nationalism. Years earlier, Francis had struck up a friendship with Jared Taylor, who went on to found the magazine with Francis\u2019s encouragement. From their first encounter, Taylor recalled, he and Francis \u201cunderstood each other immediately\u201d.</p> <p>Francis\u2019s employers at the Washington Times were not as sympathetic. The paper fired him after his comments were released, a move that was part of his larger expulsion from the respectable right. Buckley himself dismissed Francis as \u201cspokesman\u201d for a group that had \u201cearned their exclusion from thoughtful conservative ranks\u201d.</p> <p>Yet Francis would not be so easily purged. For years he had cultivated a relationship with Pat Buchanan, a one-time Nixon protege who had become one of the country\u2019s most recognisable conservatives thanks to his role as co-host of CNN\u2019s popular debating programme Crossfire. In 1992, Buchanan launched a long-shot campaign against incumbent president George HW Bush that, against all expectations, garnered almost 3m votes in the primaries. While all this was going on, Buchanan was growing closer to Francis, whom he later called \u201cperhaps the brightest and best thinker on the right\u201d.</p> <p>Francis and Buchanan were linked by their association with a breakaway faction on the right known as paleoconservatism. While mainstream conservatives had taken advantage of cushy gigs in New York and Washington, paleocons depicted themselves as spokesmen for the forgotten residents of <a href=\"http://news.nationalgeographic.com/2016/03/160314-flyover-country-origin-language-midwest/\">flyover country</a>. Francis urged Buchanan to make another run for the White House in 1996, this time as the candidate of the post-bourgeois resistance. That campaign would be based on three issues: protectionism, opposition to immigration and an \u201cAmerica First\u201d foreign policy that repudiated global commitments and foreign interventions in order to focus on defending the national interest.</p> <p>Buchanan listened, and he went on to a surprise win in New Hampshire\u2019s pivotal early primary, convincing Francis that the managerial elite was more vulnerable than at any point in his lifetime. While mainstream Republicans and Democrats celebrated forecasts that the US population was on track to become less than 50% white as a sign of America\u2019s capacity to adapt and grow, Francis believed that the members of his post-bourgeois proletariat regarded these shifting demographics as another reminder of their dwindling power.</p> <p>Buchanan\u2019s campaign fizzled after New Hampshire, but Francis had a ready explanation for the collapse: Buchanan was too loyal to the Republican party to seize the opportunity he had been granted. \u201cDon\u2019t even use the word \u2018conservative,\u2019\u201d Francis told Buchanan. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t mean anything any more.\u201d The managerial class had absorbed Buckley and his followers. They, too, were the enemy.</p> <p>After Buchanan\u2019s defeat and his own exile from mainstream conservatism, Francis devoted himself to what he called \u201cracialpolitik\u201d. He was a regular contributor to outlets promoting white racial consciousness \u2013 becoming, in Jared Taylor\u2019s words, \u201cthe intellectual leader of a small but growing movement\u201d. Francis denied that he was a white supremacist, but he condemned interracial sex, warned of \u201cincipient race war\u201d and drafted a manifesto for a white nationalist group arguing: \u201cThe American people and government should remain European in their composition and character.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--immersive\" data-media-id=\"088706af3fbf2b6b4d0d62ec41dfa8b18a8d90ac\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/088706af3fbf2b6b4d0d62ec41dfa8b18a8d90ac/0_74_2039_1223/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Pat Buchanan\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Republican presidential candidate Pat Buchanan at the Cross Roads of the West gun show in Phoenix, Arizona, 1996.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jim Bourg/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>When he looked ahead, Francis was especially concerned with the threat that one rising political star posed to his vision of the future. Barack Obama, he remarked in 2004, was \u201cthe model of what the New American is supposed to be\u201d. Ivy League-educated, effortlessly cosmopolitan, promising to transcend barriers of race \u2013 Obama was the embodiment of the managerial elite. He represented everything Francis loathed about the contemporary United States.</p> <p>The fact that Obama, Francis\u2019s symbol for American decadence, became one of the most popular figures in the country brought the great contradiction of his thought into relief. The 19th century belonged to the bourgeoisie and the 20th century to the managers, he argued, because these rising classes had performed necessary social functions. His post-bourgeois proletariat, by contrast, were on the decline.</p> <p>So was Francis. The supposed realist who cast hunger for power as the driving force of world history spent most of his time writing for journals with subscribers in the low five figures. In his last years, he was a lonely man. Before his sudden death from a cardiac aneurism in 2005, he had begun a study of conservatism and race. His masterpiece, Leviathan and Its Enemies, was still tucked away in a box of floppy disks; when it was published 11 years later, it would be under the auspices of a white-nationalist press. The right-leaning Washington Examiner ran one of his few obituaries. \u201cSam Francis,\u201d it said, \u201cwas merely a racist and doesn\u2019t deserve to be remembered as anything less.\u201d It seemed just as likely that Francis would not be remembered at all.</p> <h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> <p>\u201cI want you to really listen<strong> </strong>to this,\u201d Rush Limbaugh told his listeners in January this year. The king of rightwing talk radio was lecturing his audience, which averages around 13 million people a week, on Samuel Francis. Prompted by a magazine article casting Francis as the prophet of Trumpism, Limbaugh read aloud from one of Francis\u2019s post-mortems on the Buchanan campaign. \u201cWhat\u2019s interesting,\u201d Limbaugh said, \u201cis how right on it is in foretelling Trump.\u201d Before abandoning the subject, he added one point. Francis, Limbaugh noted, \u201clater in life suffered the \u2013 acquired the \u2013 reputation of being a white supremacist\u201d, a reputation Limbaugh insisted was undeserved.</p> <p>The white nationalists who rallied to Francis in the last decade of his life disagree on that point, but they also see Trump as a vindication of their longtime inspiration. \u201cSam would have said that Trump is doing exactly what he advised Patrick Buchanan to do,\u201d maintains Jared Taylor, who made news in the primary season when it was revealed that he had recorded automated phone messages endorsing Trump. (\u201cWhite Supremacist Robocall Heartily Urges Iowa Voters to Support Trump,\u201d reported a headline in the conservative Daily Caller.) According to Taylor\u2019s American Renaissance, \u201cFrancis would be very pleased to see the GOP and conservative establishments mocked and destroyed.\u201d</p> <p>Even liberal commentators are looking back at Francis \u2013 whose prediction of a white working-class backlash against a globalist ruling elite seems to be coming true not just in the US but across Europe. \u201cIf you just drop the white nationalism a lot of Francis makes sense,\u201d says Michael Lind, who once worked as an assistant to Buckley but now describes himself as a \u201cradical centrist\u201d. According to Lind, conservatives have been \u201cspurning their natural constituency \u2013 the mostly white working class\u201d, creating space for the rise of Trump.</p> <p>Francis was also an inspiration for the team at the Journal of American Greatness, who called him \u201cthe closest thing to what could be described as the source of Trumpian thought\u201d in their very first post. They admitted that Francis\u2019s writing \u201covertly indulges various Southern nostalgias\u201d, but insisted that his \u201cdeservedly criticised statements on race\u201d could be separated from the core of his analysis. The managerial class was still the enemy, and only Trump seemed even dimly aware of what it would take to mount an effective challenge.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The authors of JAG looked at the problems facing the US and concluded that Donald Trump might be the answer</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>But the authors at JAG wanted to do more than add chapters to the history Francis had already sketched. While they remain anonymous, sources have identified them as part of a conservative establishment located outside the Washington-New York axis that dominates the intellectual life of the American right \u2013 probably associated with the California-based <a href=\"http://www.claremont.org/\">Claremont Institute</a> and the midwestern <a href=\"https://www.hillsdale.edu/\">Hillsdale College</a>.</p> <p>Trump the candidate, they admitted, was at best an imperfect messenger. But it was the message that counted: \u201cThe American regime \u2013 like nearly all its cousins in the west \u2013 has devolved into an oligarchy.\u201d JAG was not just arguing that Trump\u2019s campaign had a coherent agenda \u2013 a controversial assertion, given that many on both the left and right have dismissed Trump as an unhinged demagogue jabbing randomly at pressure points in the electorate. It was arguing that Trump succeeded <em>because</em> of his platform. Without those ideas, he would have been just another novelty candidate. Armed with them, any of Trump\u2019s more disciplined rivals might have stolen the nomination from him \u2013 but instead they opted for recycled bromides from the Reagan era.</p> <p>The site could be fiery in its defence of Trump, but the best moments came when its targets were the grandees of the right. There are plenty of scathing articles about rightwing thinktanks written from the left, but none of their authors could write a sentence such as \u201cSeeing conservatives court billionaires \u2013 which I have had occasion to do dozens, if not hundreds, of times \u2013 is like watching dorks tell cheerleaders how pretty they are.\u201d</p> <p>For all that, the authors of JAG were still thinkers who looked at the problems facing the US and concluded that Donald Trump might be the answer. They denounced conservatives for accepting \u201cthe leftist lie\u201d that having a \u201cnatural affinity for people who look, think and speak\u201d alike \u201cis shameful and illegitimate\u201d. \u201cThe ceaseless importation of people unaccustomed to liberty,\u201d they wrote \u2013 referring to \u201cmass third world immigration\u201d \u2013 \u201cmakes the American people less fit for liberty every day\u201d. Islam was a subject of particular concern. \u201cWhat good,\u201d they asked, \u201chas Muslim immigration done for the United States and the American people?\u201d Francis would have approved.</p> <h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> <p>With its archive deleted, JAG\u2019s internet presence is now confined to the occasional mournful tweet from one of its former readers, but the problems it identified on the right are more glaring than ever. \u201cThe conservative movement\u2019s mission has become providing comfortable professional livelihoods to literally hundreds of people,\u201d David Frum told me recently. Although this behemoth has proved effective at turning a profit, the intellectual returns on the investment have been paltry. \u201cConservatism was a lot more creative and effective when it had less money,\u201d Frum said.</p> <p>This narrowing of intellectual ambitions has coincided with a crisis of authority. When asked to name the dominant theme of the right\u2019s intellectual history since George W Bush left office, conservative journalist Michael Brendan Dougherty responded with one word: \u201cdisintegration\u201d. Buckley has been dead for the better part of a decade, and no successor has emerged with the clout to take up his role as arbiter of the true faith.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the little magazines that once set the tempo of debate have struggled to maintain their influence in the age of social media. \u201cTwenty years ago if you got the summer internship at National Review you were high-fiving everyone you knew,\u201d one conservative activist told me. \u201cThat was like getting the Goldman Sachs internship. You were set.\u201d</p> <p>Charles Kesler, a senior fellow at the Claremont Institute and professor at nearby Claremont McKenna College, sees a generational change underway. His best students, he says, used to seek out three paths: some went into academia, others into politics, and a third group tried to navigate a path between the two as writers for middlebrow journals such as National Review. But that middle ground has eroded in the last decade, Kesler says. Now many feel \u201crevulsion\u201d at the state of public debate and take refuge in academia \u2013 or they succumb to a \u201cpopulist tug\u201d and end up at rightwing clickbait factories such as <a href=\"http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2016/03/01/how-breitbart-unleashes-hate-mobs-to-threaten-dox-and-troll-trump-critics.html\">Breitbart News</a>. That pull will only grow stronger now that Trump has shown how little influence establishment conservatives have over the constituency they claim to represent.</p> <p>In Washington, a policy-minded cohort dubbed the <a href=\"http://www.wsj.com/articles/republican-conservative-reformicons-put-new-twist-on-tax-debate-1423010939\">reformicons</a> has become the great hope for conservatives planning their response to the rise of Trump. Long before this year\u2019s campaign, they had begun to devise a more populist agenda to appeal to the working-class voters who have become an increasingly significant part of the Republican electorate. With an eye to the future, they are also convinced that Republicans need to reject Trump\u2019s brand of white identity politics if it hopes to win elections in a country becoming more diverse by the day.</p> <p>From the reformicon perspective, Trump represents a pathological response to the legitimate complaints of voters whose concerns have been overlooked for too long. The challenge for savvy Republican politicians is to convert the impulses that have propelled Trump\u2019s rise into a platform that can appeal to a multiracial coalition.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--immersive\" data-media-id=\"4e54fa933163284de5893fa844788d8525b4f65f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4e54fa933163284de5893fa844788d8525b4f65f/0_56_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Donald Trump\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Donald Trump speaks at the Republican national convention in Cleveland, Ohio, July 2016.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mike Segar/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Yet the well-intentioned reforming wonks have struggled to find an audience outside the capital. Part of the problem is financial. \u201cThere\u2019s no money from rich donors even for reasonable populism,\u201d says Michael Lind. To the ears of conservative billionaires, pleas for economic policies that appeal to workers sound like the prelude to tax hikes on the wealthy. For a Washington-based movement offering what the sceptics at JAG called \u201cmanagerialism with a human face\u201d, a lack of wealthy donors is a potentially fatal obstacle.</p> <p>Of all the forces unleashed by the rise of Trump, the one that may pose the greatest threat to the relevance of the conservative intellectual establishment is the gleefully offensive movement known as the alt-right. Nurtured by online forums such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/reddit\">Reddit</a> and 4chan, along with white-nationalist standbys such as American Renaissance, the alt-right has become a vehicle for the simmering anger of mostly white and mostly young men \u2013 with strong links to the earlier varieties of racialpolitik promoted by Francis, who is sometimes cited as a founder of the alt-right. Mainstream conservatives have reacted with shock and horror to this development. \u201cThe nasty mouth-breathers Buckley expelled from conservatism have returned,\u201d declared a typical response from Commentary, one of the major journals of the establishment right.</p> <p>But the new iconoclasts of the alt-right can\u2019t be purged from a conservative movement they have no desire to join, especially when they can reach an audience of millions on social media. If there is an heir today to the young William F Buckley \u2013 who launched his career with exuberant attacks on the hypocrisy of the liberal establishment and managed to make conservatism look like a stylish rebellion against the powers-that-be \u2013 it might be someone like <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/jul/20/milo-yiannopoulos-nero-permanently-banned-twitter\">Milo Yiannopoulos</a>, a professional provocateur who has become a spokesman for the alt-right. At one typical event this spring, Yiannopoulos, who refers to Trump as \u201cDaddy\u201d, delivered a lecture with the title Feminism Is Cancer after being ushered into the auditorium on a throne held aloft by students wearing \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d hats. Yiannopoulos\u2019s critics are rightly concerned that his main agenda is promoting himself, but Brand Milo is a booming business.</p> <p>The future looks more precarious for the guardians of True Conservatism. They have strong support from leading figures in the Republican party such as Paul Ryan, and retain control over an infrastructure of donors, thinktanks and journals. A landslide defeat for Trump could still revive their cause, but they could just as easily be swept aside by a rising generation of rightwing activists with a more Trumpian set of concerns.</p> <p>Their brand of conservatism won\u2019t disappear, but it could become more a curiosity than a movement, as it was in the days before the birth of the modern right over half a century ago. \u201cThe whole Buckley experiment may have been a passing phase,\u201d says Lind \u2013 a strange interlude when a cohort of writers mistook their ideological preferences for the will of the people and, even stranger, provided the basis for an industry based on that delusion. The anxiety that its time has passed lurks underneath all the conservative establishment\u2019s impassioned denunciations of Trump: a fear that his unprecedented victory in the Republican primary has demonstrated it is already obsolete. \u201cI\u2019m a conservative,\u201d Trump said in April, \u201cbut at this point who cares?\u201d</p> <p>But Trump may have unintentionally pointed the way for a new kind of American conservatism, driven by resentment at the globalist diktats of the hated managerial class. Over the last year, that anger has emerged in surprising venues. In language that Francis would have recognised, the billionaire <a href=\"http://nymag.com/selectall/2016/06/peter-thiel.html\">PayPal co-founder and Silicon Valley guru Peter Thiel</a> declared that America is no longer a democracy \u2013 since it has become a country \u201cdominated by very unelected, technocratic agencies\u201d.</p> <p>Thiel has been an outspoken libertarian since his days as an undergraduate at Stanford in the 1980s, and in 2008 he supplied $500,000 for an attempt to create manmade islands that would provide an \u201cescape from politics in all its forms\u201d, but lately he has started to associate himself with a different crowd. In July, following an outpouring of criticism, <a href=\"https://news.fastcompany.com/peter-thiel-to-speak-atconference-thrown-by-group-tied-to-white-nationalists-4010060\">he cancelled a planned appearance</a> in front of a group that has provided a meeting ground for libertarians and white nationalists, including Francis\u2019s close friend Jared Taylor. But a similar public outcry did not persuade him to drop another speaking engagement earlier that month: a speech on the final night of the Republican national convention, where he had come as a delegate to cast his vote for Donald Trump.</p> <p>\u2022 Follow the Long Read on Twitter at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/@gdnlongread\">@gdnlongread</a>, or sign up to the long read weekly email <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2015/jul/20/sign-up-to-the-long-read-email\">here</a>.</p>",
  "<p>In episode three of the classic British comedy The Young Ones, there\u2019s a scene where one cop tells another he\u2019s had a \u201cheavy bust up this morning with m\u2019lady\u201d because he insulted the Pope. \u201cThat\u2019s a bit stupid, you know she\u2019s Catholic,\u201d the other says. \u201cYeah, I know she\u2019s Catholic. I didn\u2019t know the Pope was,\u201d comes the reply. The scene then cuts away to a photograph of the pair above a Guardian headline: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z55mLS-qWnc\">\u201cPolice IQ Shocker\u201d</a>.</p> <p>But even in an age where real life is becoming impossible to satirise, you couldn\u2019t have made the following <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/aug/14/abc-journalist-josh-bavass-detention-at-bunnings-being-examined-by-police\">confrontation from last weekend</a> up. A Queensland cop who identifies himself as senior constable Richard Power approaches a man minding his own business in a car park outside a hardware store. The man, who is suffering from a heavy cold, just happens to be the local police reporter for the ABC, Josh Bavas.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/aug/14/abc-journalist-josh-bavass-detention-at-bunnings-being-examined-by-police\">ABC journalist Josh Bavas's detention at Bunnings being examined by police</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cMate, the fact that you\u2019ve got pinpoint eyes and <em>you\u2019re looking directly into the sun and they\u2019re not dilating due to the sunlight</em>, I believe you to be under the influence of a dangerous drug,\u201d he says, before detaining him. When Bavas protests, the officer\u2019s colleague replies \u201cOh fucking mate, if we hadn\u2019t have hung onto you mate, you\u2019d float off into fucking outer space.\u201d</p> <p>Bavas records and posts the exchange on Twitter, where it immediately goes viral \u2013 #dickpower trending nationally \u2013 and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/aug/13/i-have-a-cold-journalist-shocked-after-police-say-he-seems-to-be-on-drugs\">makes headlines</a>. He is soon released without charge and goes back to building a retaining wall at home. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/aug/14/abc-journalist-josh-bavass-detention-at-bunnings-being-examined-by-police\">Queensland Police Service says it is investigating the behaviour of the officers concerned</a>. Bavas then deletes the footage and declines to pursue the matter.</p> <p>That is a matter for him. But there are a number of points to be made here.</p> <p>The first reaction, beyond the \u201cIQ shocker\u201d of an officer who believes pupils should dilate when looking at the sun, is fascination at what happens when the surveillance state is turned upon itself. When the second officer swears, Power reminds him he is being recorded \u2013 not only by Bavas but Power, too, who has a camera planted on his uniform. We hear a grunted apology.</p> <p>The lesson here is a reminder of your legal right to record any untoward interaction you may have with law enforcement. It\u2019s not often we see such naked police hostility, and ineptitude, itself being policed by someone with the presence of mind to record, challenge and disseminate it, let alone by someone who reports on police and court proceedings for a living.</p> <p>The second reaction is more troubling, and has been pointed out by the ABC\u2019s Mark Colvin. It\u2019s not that the wallopers picked on the \u201cwrong guy\u201d \u2013 a white police journalist who knows his rights. How does any member of the force think it\u2019s appropriate to behave in such a contemptuous manner towards any member of the public? </p> <p>To detain Bavas, the police needed a \u201creasonable suspicion\u201d that Bavas had committed a crime, or was about to. Reasonable suspicions can be difficult to define, but it\u2019s doubtful presuming a man to be \u201cpinned\u201d because his pupils failed to dilate in direct sunlight would impress any magistrate.</p> <p>What has been said of the situation\u2019s broader context only makes it worse. Allegations have been made that the officers\u2019 suspicions were aroused because Bavas was seated close to a group of young Indigenous people. Power apparently asked Bavas if he was with them, before turning his attention to the youths and questioning whether the car they were travelling in was stolen.</p> <p>Two dumb officers, or a wider problem? The popular \u201cbad apples\u201d theory is unlikely to fly with the Indigenous community, for whom such low-level harassment is a disproportionately high reality. Twenty-five years after the royal commission into Aboriginal deaths in custody, the risk of Indigenous Australians being imprisoned remains <a href=\"http://www.sbs.com.au/news/article/2016/04/15/national-crisis-indigenous-incarceration-rates-worse-25-years\">13 times higher</a> than for the general population.</p> <p>Of course, that is a national problem, not limited to Queensland. In the wake of the announcement of another royal commission into the abuse of youths at Don Dale Detention Centre in Darwin \u2013 which had been reported on for years before the image of Dylan Voller in a spit hood sparked national revulsion \u2013 there have been <a href=\"http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-07-27/four-corners-malcolm-turnbull-rules-out-expand-royal-commission/7664108\">many calls for its remit to be widened</a> beyond the Northern Territory\u2019s borders.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/15/can-the-law-come-to-the-rescue-of-abused-asylum-seekers-and-refugees\">Can the law come to the rescue of abused asylum seekers and refugees? | Richard Ackland</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The QPS has <a href=\"http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-07-05/qps-review-finds-no-evidence-of-widespread-negative-culture/7571452\">looked into its own culture</a> in a series of reviews in the last 12 months after widespread allegations of excessive force, bullying and inappropriate behaviour centred on the Gold Coast, unfortunately bucking an overall statewide reduction in complaints. Another review looked at how to de-escalate violent confrontations, following a series of fatal police shootings between 2013 and 2014.</p> <p>What happened to Bavas by contrast was petty, even ridiculous, and made the officers concerned look like fools. Queensland premier Annastacia Palaszczuk expressed her concerns and reminded the force of its obligation to treat all members of the public with respect, before acknowledging that officers had a difficult job to do \u2013 sentiments quickly echoed by Bavas.</p> <p>No one doubts policing is a tough gig. But in a culture where \u201ctough on crime\u201d talkback rhetoric rules, civil liberties have been steadily eroded, surveillance is endorsed by both major parties as the price we pay for security, and racial profiling is officially frowned upon but unofficially viewed as cautionary, the security apparatus of the state can only be emboldened.</p> <p>What happened at Don Dale shows where that can end. What happened to Josh Bavas gives the rest of us a glimpse into where it begins.</p>",

  "<p>MS Estraden looks, on first glance, like a normal cargo ship. Just another one of the 50,000 <a href=\"http://www.ics-shipping.org/shipping-facts/shipping-and-world-trade\" rel=\"nofollow\">vessels</a> transporting pretty much everything we buy, sell and consume. </p> <p>But on closer inspection, ship-spotting enthusiasts will notice two large cylinders rising from the deck. These are rotating devices that capture wind and help propel the ship forward. It is technology first trialled back in the 1920s, but only now brought into commercial use.</p> <p>For the past year and a half, the MS Estraden, which belongs to the Dutch-owned shipping company Bore, has been testing out the cylinders on its regular journey between Rotterdam and Teesport, on the north-east coast of the UK. The result: it has <a href=\"http://www.norsepower.com/SiteAssets/news/Norsepower%20Press%20Release%202016-01-29.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">cut fuel costs by 6%</a> (pdf).</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s hard to generalise because unlike many other technologies, the savings are dependent on the route sailed (and the weather conditions specific to that route), but the savings on large tankers and bulk carriers could be greater than 10%,\u201d says Tristan Smith, shipping and climate change expert at UCL.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3f026e64fb901864906343ead8bf8bd76326caab\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3f026e64fb901864906343ead8bf8bd76326caab/0_0_3200_1920/1000.jpg\" alt=\"One of the rotor sails being hoisted onto the MS Estraden before its trial.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">One of the rotor sails being hoisted onto the MS Estraden before its trial.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Norsepower</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Smith has been following the MS Estraden and its wind cylinders trial with interest as he looks into ways shipping companies can cut their greenhouse gas emissions.

The industry has no targets for reducing emissions; the climate talks in Paris last year were skilfully negotiated with warnings that a <a href=\"http://www.climatechangenews.com/2015/09/28/un-shipping-chief-warns-against-emissions-cap/\" rel=\"nofollow\">cap on emissions</a> for shipping would be a cap on global trade and growth.</p> <p>On current projections, the sector could be <a href=\"https://www.transportenvironment.org/sites/te/files/publications/Shipping%20and%20aviation%20emissions%20and%202%20degrees%20v1-6.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">contributing upwards of 6%</a> (pdf) of global greenhouse gas emissions by 2050.</p> <p>Although the UN agency that regulates shipping puts out glowing <a href=\"http://www.imo.org/en/MediaCentre/PressBriefings/Pages/55-paris-agreement.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\">press releases</a>, its only <a href=\"http://www.imo.org/en/MediaCentre/PressBriefings/Pages/11-data-collection-.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\">two policies</a> so far are achieving little.

Signs saying, \u201cMuslims Lives Matter Too\u201d, and, \u201cWe Want Justice\u201d, dotted the crowd. </p> <p>The hearses of the two men were parked at the front of the parking lot to be prayed on before they were driven out to lead a procession of mourners to the mosque.</p> <p>Akonjee and Uddin <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/14/muslim-cleric-and-a-second-man-killed-after-prayers-in-new-york\">were shot</a> in the back of the head on Saturday afternoon on 79th and Liberty Avenue, as they walked home from a midday prayer at the mosque. </p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/aug/15/nypd-killing-muslim-cleric-imam-video\">Surveillance footage</a> shows a man running up behind the men before both of them collapsed to the ground.

Local community members described both men as calm, gentle figures who kept to themselves and were deeply devout. </p> <p>Akonjee was the father of seven who had immigrated to the United States around five years ago. His neighbor Mohammed Haque said he was deeply distraught by the loss of a truly good man. </p> <p>Sixteen-year-old Maher Meah was Akonjee\u2019s student at the mosque, and was also deeply distraught. </p> <p>\u201cHe told us to stay away from drugs and alcohol. He was a motivational speaker that would tell you how to live your life,\u201d Meah said. \u201cJust to see a life gone like that, is just scary.\u201d</p> <p>Uddin had also recently immigrated to the United States. His two brothers who live in New York and New Jersey helped him immigrate to the country, a family member told the Guardian. He had five children, three of whom live with him in New York, one son and two daughters. </p> <p>Around the corner from their homes, dozens of protesters gathered after the funeral to call for justice to be brought to the shooters. Under the train tracks on Liberty Avenue, protesters screamed \u201cWe Want Justice\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cHate speech creates violence,\u201d said Tarek Mohammed, who had travelled from New Jersey to attend the funeral. \u201cDonald Trump has a big hand in that.

At the same time, a friend of mine who arrived in Australia by boat to seek asylum lost contact with his mother who lives in that city. For days he didn\u2019t sleep, hardly ate and imagined the worst. Thankfully, she survived these attacks, though each day remains full of fear and uncertainty for her safety, compounded by regular reports of fresh attacks on the Hazara.</span></p> <p>When my friend came as an unaccompanied child to apply for protection, government legislation meant that if his claim was approved he could then seek a \u201cfamily reunion\u201d humanitarian visa for his mother. Since then, these rules have changed, meaning that anyone who arrived by boat to seek asylum is ineligible to apply for this kind of visa. Without policy change, it\u2019s unlikely he\u2019ll see his mother again.</p> <p>In 2014, he finished high school, winning awards for community service and vocational education. He\u2019s one of the lucky few people on a bridging visa who is attending university \u2013 paid for by a generous member of the public \u2013 because people on bridging visas or TPVs must pay international student fees to study at university. Without this generosity, his academic and employment potential would be left unexplored and his contribution to our community diminished. He works two part-time jobs and volunteers with Welcome to Australia and other organisations supporting asylum seekers and refugees \u2013 organising community dinners, delivering furniture, speaking in schools and more.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/apr/13/we-are-the-forgotten-people-the-anguish-of-australias-invisible-asylum-seekers\">'We are the forgotten people': the anguish of Australia's 'invisible' asylum seekers</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Under Coalition government policy, the best my friend can hope for is to be granted a temporary protection visa, designed to ensure that those whose claims are successful will never attain Australian citizenship.

Even when they are found to be refugees \u2013 after negotiating an approval process that is intentionally stacked against them \u2013 there is no pathway to gaining the security and sense of belonging that citizenship provides. </p> <p>They face years of uncertainty, struggle and those on TPVs will be forced to re-prove their refugee status every three years, with the potential to having their status overturned and being forced to leave Australia. People who came here as unaccompanied children or single adults are coping with the thought that they might never see their families again thanks to the changes to family reunion policy.</p> <p>The depression and hopelessness in this community are deepening with the return of the Coalition government \u2013 which, in fact, is the intent of a policy designed to encourage people to return to the place of danger or oppression from which they fled.</p> <p>They, of course, talk about their friends and family suffering on Manus Island or Nauru and are desperate for those ugly, abusive facilities to be shut down. They can\u2019t understand how we could continue to ignore <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/series/nauru-files\">report after report </a>of the damage being done to children and adults in our care.</p> <p>Like a growing number of Australians, they\u2019re well aware of the ideological and practical inconsistencies of their place in Coalition policy. Boats carrying people coming to Australia to seek asylum are being intercepted. If, for any reason, those people aren\u2019t returned to their country of departure, they\u2019ll be sent to Nauru or Manus Island with a government guarantee of never settling in Australia.<br></p> <p> The citizenship status of people who have now been living freely in the Australian community for more than three years plays no part in stopping people travelling by boat to seek asylum.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/15/can-the-law-come-to-the-rescue-of-abused-asylum-seekers-and-refugees\">Can the law come to the rescue of abused asylum seekers and refugees? | Richard Ackland</a> </p> </aside>  <p>What temporary protection visas do stop is 30,000 Australian residents being able to fully thrive and contribute to our society. TPVs ensure that many of the children now studying in Australian schools will not go to university or reach their academic potential. As we stop these children chasing their dreams, we rob our community of doctors, nurses, designers, teachers, scientists, leaders and artists. With refugees statistically more entrepreneurial than long-term citizens and other migrants, excluding 30,000 people from the security of citizenship means depriving Australia of innovative businesses, jobs and economic growth.</p> <p>Temporary protection visas harm people, damage Australia\u2019s economy and add nothing to the Coalition\u2019s system of \u201cprotecting our border\u201d. Beyond cheap political point-scoring, there\u2019s no reason not to give 30,000 of our most industrious and resilient residents the security they risked their lives to gain.</p> <p>My young friend \u2013 and the thousands like him \u2013 should be freed from the gratuitous cruelty of perpetual limbo and given the opportunity to contribute their potential to the building of the nation they\u2019d love to call home.

  "<p>I come from an Aboriginal mission called Wreck Bay in the ACT.</p> <p>When I was growing up the gates were still up. These gates kept our people on the mission, and locked others out. At seven in the morning they opened, and at seven each night they closed.</p> <p>When I was a little older, they took the gates down. That is, they took the actual gates themselves off, but the posts remained: a big square arch.</p> <p>The mission manager was trying to tell us we were free to come and go as we pleased, but the posts had the same effect as the gates that preceded them.</p> <p> So I grew up on the mission, and went to a small mission school.</p> <p> Later on they transferred all of the kids from the mission over and mixed us with the naval base children, and we made a lot of friends.</p> <p> Being kids, we thought it was great that we were going to mix with all of these other, non-Aboriginal kids, but unbeknownst to us there was huge ruckus in the non-Aboriginal community because they didn\u2019t want their kids mixing with Aboriginal kids.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/15/gratuitous-emphasis-on-race-why-bill-leaks-cartoon-fails-to-be-meaningful\">Gratuitous emphasis on race: why Bill Leak's cartoon fails to be meaningful | Jack Latimore</a> </p> </aside>  <p> My first week at this school \u2013 this was when I was in Year Four \u2013 my teacher stood me out in front of the class and said:</p> <p> \u201cYou see this boy? He\u2019s stupid.</p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s got no initiative.</p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s never going to go anywhere in life, and you shouldn\u2019t grow up like him.\u201d</p> <p>Obviously, to hear that as a young kid, that hurt, and it\u2019s stuck with me, and it\u2019s probably something that\u2019s motivated me to be where I am today.</p> <p>When I saw that cartoon in the Australian the other week, as an Aboriginal father, as a father to Aboriginal children, I felt insulted. I felt sad, in many ways.<br></p> <p>It\u2019s sad that people think it\u2019s okay to do that.<br></p> <p>To be demonised in that fashion, to me, it felt like that teacher that told me I wasn\u2019t worth anything, that I wasn\u2019t going to amount to anything, who told the class don\u2019t grow up like this boy.<br></p> <p>I always try to look at things from a glass-half-full perspective. If there\u2019s a lesson somewhere in this situation, then some good can come out of it.</p> <p>The way in which our community has reacted, particularly with the #IndigenousDads campaign and those positive stories and photos, is a fantastic example of that.</p> <p>That extends to the way a lot of Australians have reacted including non-Aboriginal people who were hurt by that cartoon. The good people out there who said, \u201cYou know what? That\u2019s a racist and cruel image, and it\u2019s cast on all of the people out there who have a social conscience and who care about people as human beings.\u201d</p> <p>Personally, I\u2019d like to think there\u2019s more people who think that way than the people who would look at it and laugh, and say, \u201cYeah. That\u2019s just blackfullas for you.\u201d</p> <p>When I look at that cartoon I don\u2019t see anything in it that relates to my family. My parents taught me patience, and tolerance, and good manners, and how to communicate properly with people, and to treat others as you would want yourself to be treated. That\u2019s the way it is in my family, and it\u2019s never left us.</p> <p>That\u2019s not to say it doesn\u2019t disturb me, but at the same time \u2013 however unfortunate it is \u2013 that\u2019s a fact of life for us. There\u2019ll be worse cartoons than that in the future, and I\u2019m pretty sure there\u2019s been worse cartoons in the past.</p> <p>Our attitude has to be <em>how can we face this adversity and make things better for ourselves? </em>It\u2019s always got to be about improving ourselves, and sometimes we need to do that by proving other people wrong.</p> <p>That idea of self-development is probably something that we don\u2019t often consider when we talk about self-determination.</p> <p>It\u2019s something that really helps me believe in things like the <a href=\"http://www.familymatters.org.au/\">Family Matters campaign</a>. In having the ability to mobilise our organisations and services we can mobilise other people, and really empower our parents in the long term.</p> <p>With Family Matters we have a national campaign to ensure kids grow up safe and cared for in family, community and culture. Our aim is to eliminate the over-representation of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children in out-of-home care within a generation.</p> <p>The real strength of Family Matters is that the campaign is led by over 120 Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander and non-Indigenous organisations from across the country.</p> <p>If a campaign can bring structure and direction out of peak bodies and other organisations \u2013 and even individuals \u2013 to want to strive to do better, then we\u2019ll come up with effective ideas and solutions-based angles and help our communities on the ground to help themselves.</p> <p>We\u2019ve seen it time after time: it\u2019s just not possible to go out by yourself and change the entire world, but it is possible to go in and empower people, and listen, and get local solutions for local problems, and work on how best to put those solutions into action.</p> <p>It\u2019s going to have to happen from the ground up, and it\u2019s going to have to be led by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people.</p> <p>Government can chuck as much money at problems as they like, but they\u2019ve been doing that for a long time, and the results haven\u2019t satisfied anybody.</p> <p>It\u2019s a bit like those gate posts from the mission: one group seeing something from a very different perspective from the other.</p> <p>They just need to listen better and get our people to help develop their solutions, rather than have governments saying, \u201cI\u2019m going to put a committee in place, and they\u2019re going to come up with great ideas, and we\u2019re going to get good policies,\u201d and then going back to the community to say, \u201cBoy!
