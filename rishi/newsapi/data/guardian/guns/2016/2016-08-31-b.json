  "<p>Indigenous drug and alcohol workers made three attempts to find Jayden Bennell on the afternoon he died in custody, a coronial inquest has heard.<br></p> <p>Bennell, a 20-year-old Bibbulmun Noongar man, attended the Pathways rehabilitation program twice a week for five weeks, including attending on the morning of the day he died \u2013 6 March 2013.</p> <p>But when the afternoon session started at 1.30pm on that day Bennell was not there, the program\u2019s lead facilitator Benjamin Moodie said.</p> <p>Two hours later he was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/aug/29/indigenous-man-jayden-bennell-missing-four-hours-found-dead-wa-prison-cupboard\">found hanged in an unlocked cleaning storage room</a> opposite his cell in unit 5 of Perth\u2019s Casuarina maximum security prison.</p> <p>Moodie told a coronial inquest at Perth magistrates court on Wednesday that it was not unusual for some people to be a few minutes late to the program but it was unusual for Bennell not to attend, as he was \u201cvery committed\u201d.</p> <p>He said he was \u201cvery shocked\u201d when he later heard Bennell had died and became emotional describing a conversation he had had with Bennell that morning, when he had spoken about his plans once he got parole.</p> <p>\u201cThe part that stands out to me the most is him talking about the impact that his crimes had on his family and that he would like to cook dinner for his mother when he is released,\u201d Moodie said.</p> <p>Moodie told the court that he approached the control room in the centre of the prison\u2019s education area three times to ask the guards to look for Bennell: once at 1.35pm, then again 20 minutes later and a third time about 2.30pm. He said he spoke to the same guard each time and was told they would call Bennell\u2019s unit, and at one stage was told Bennell was on his way.</p> <p>He said it was not unusual to have to make one request to the guards to chase up late prisoners but he became worried when Bennell was still missing after the third call. His co-worker, Russell Butler, who confirmed they had made three requests to find him, said he was worried Bennell would ruin his chances of parole. </p> <p>Both said they had a good rapport with Bennell, who they described as a \u201crespectful\u201d, good kid, and felt they knew him well. Neither noticed any changes in his demeanour that morning. If they had, they said, they would have alerted the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/aug/31/indigenous-prisoner-jayden-bennell-showed-suicide-risk-inquest-told\">prison\u2019s mental health service</a> and offered him support. Butler said he was \u201cdevastated\u201d when he heard of his death.</p> <p>According to prison records previously discussed in the inquest, the last sign of Bennell alive was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/aug/29/indigenous-man-jayden-bennell-missing-four-hours-found-dead-wa-prison-cupboard\">an attempt to telephone his brother at 1.26pm</a>. The call didn\u2019t go through and the autopsy report puts Bennell\u2019s time of death as anywhere between then and his discovery in the storage cupboard at 3.45pm.</p> <p>Andrew Hall, a prison guard who was working in the education centre control room, said he did not recall being asked to put in a call to unit 5 to find Bennell but that it was possible, if he was only asked once and someone else took the other two requests, that he would have forgotten.</p> <p>All three witnesses were asked about the incident for the first time this year, three years after Bennell died.</p> <p>Coroner Sarah Linton said she was inclined to believe Moodie and Butler\u2019s evidence even though none of the six prison guards who have spoken at the inquest specifically mentioned being asked to find Bennell before the 3.15pm muster.</p> <p>\u201cI can\u2019t see that Mr Moodie or Mr Butler would be wrong in the sense that it was something that would be significant to them in a way that it\u2019s not significant to the other prison officers,\u201d Linton said.</p> <p>The inquest also heard from the head of the prison\u2019s ligature minimisation program, Andrew Daniels, who said there were at least as many hanging points in Bennell\u2019s cell as in the storage room where he died, despite the prison having spent $5m on ligature minimisation in the years leading up to Bennell\u2019s death. Determining which cells would be made safer, he said, depended on the available budget.</p> <p>He also said he was not familiar with the recommendations of the 1998-1991 royal commission into Aboriginal deaths in custody, which dealt extensively with hanging points.</p> <p>Daniels said it was \u201cimpractical to impossible\u201d to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/aug/30/room-prisoner-jayden-bennell-died-in-left-unlocked-until-last-week-inquest-told\">minimise the hanging points in the storage closet</a>, saying \u201cit is a room that probably should not have been open.\u201d<br></p> <p>However he agreed with a suggestion from David Leigh, counsel for the department of corrective services, that Bennell could have killed himself just as easily in his cell.</p> <p>\u201cOnce the cell is sealed it\u2019s about as invisible and sealed off as the cleaning closet,\u201d Leigh said.</p> <p>The inquest continues.</p> <p><em>\u2022 Crisis support services can be reached 24 hours a day: <a href=\"http://www.lifeline.org.au/\">Lifeline</a> 13 11 14; <a href=\"http://www.suicidecallbackservice.org.au/\">Suicide Call Back Service</a> 1300 659 467; <a href=\"http://www.kidshelp.com.au/\">Kids Helpline</a> 1800 55 1800; <a href=\"http://www.mensline.org.au/\">MensLine Australia</a>1300 78 99 78</em></p>",
  "<p>Following their meeting on Wednesday, Mexico\u2019s president, Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto, insisted he told Donald Trump, during their meeting in Mexico City, that Mexico would not pay for a border wall between their two countries.</p> <p>\u201cAt the start of the conversation with Donald Trump, I made clear that Mexico will not pay for the wall,\u201d Pe\u00f1a Nieto <a href=\"https://twitter.com/EPN/status/771118159654891520\">tweeted</a>. A spokesman for the Mexican president later told the Guardian that there was no discussion of paying for the wall because Trump did not respond to Pe\u00f1a Nieto\u2019s statement. \u201cThe president told him clearly and the matter was not discussed further.\u201d </p> <p>Trump had told reporters after the meeting that while the pair had discussed a border wall, the topic of who would pay for it did not come up. \u201cWe didn\u2019t discuss payment of the wall. That\u2019ll be for a later date,\u201d Trump said.</p> <p>Trump\u2019s campaign later released a statement that did not directly address the controversy.</p> <p>\u201cToday was the first part of the discussion and a relationship builder between Mr Trump and President Pe\u00f1a Nieto. It was not a negotiation, and that would have been inappropriate. It is unsurprising that they hold two different views on this issue, and we look forward to continuing the conversation.\u201d</p> <p>A Trump source with knowledge of the meeting later added to the Guardian, \u201cboth parties knew each other\u2019s positions going into today, and we didn\u2019t think it was appropriate to start negotiating during this meeting.\u201d</p> <p>Pe\u00f1a Nieto had faced a wave of domestic criticism for inviting Trump to see him at Los Pinos, the residence of the Mexican president. The controversy came just hours after Trump left Mexico City for Arizona, where he was due to hold a major policy speech on immigration that same evening. </p> <p>The two met for an hour and then appeared before reporters to make separate statements about their unusual summit.</p> <p>Speaking at a podium next to Pe\u00f1a Nieto, Trump did his utmost to appear presidential on his second trip abroad and first meeting with a head of state as a candidate. However, in doing so, Trump seemed to continue <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/31/donald-trump-mexico-pena-nieto-immigration-arizona\">the \u201csoftening\u201d of his rhetoric</a> on immigration in advance of his policy speech on the topic, which he was to deliver later on Wednesday night.</p> <p>Speaking at the podium in restrained and almost subdued tones, Trump described undocumented immigrants as those entering the United States \u201cwithout legal authorization\u201d, praised first-, second- and third-generation Mexican Americans as \u201cbeyond reproach\u201d and talked about keeping jobs \u201cin our hemisphere\u201d. This was in addition to Trump\u2019s concession to reporters afterwards that while he had discussed building a border wall with Pe\u00f1a Nieto, he did not even bring up his <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/apr/05/donald-trump-mexico-border-wall-plan-remittances\">signature proposal that Mexico would pay for such a wall</a>. </p> <p>This served as a major contrast to Trump\u2019s fiery and often bombastic tone on the campaign trail. </p> <p>He launched his candidacy in June 2015 by accusing Mexico of deliberately sending criminals and \u201crapists\u201d to the US and has since claimed that a federal judge, Gustavo Curiel, could not do his job impartially <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jun/03/donald-trump-judge-curiel-university-case-biased-mexican\">because of his Mexican heritage</a>. At almost every campaign rally since then, Trump has held a call and response with his rambunctious crowds, asking: \u201cWho is going to pay for the wall?\u201d The shouted answer has invariably been: \u201cMexico.\u201d</p> <p>The Republican nominee has also repeatedly bashed free trade agreements, like Nafta, which he has said allows US workers to lose their jobs to Mexicans; as well as attacking specific companies for shifting their operations to Mexico. </p> <p>While it was speculated that Pe\u00f1a Nieto, who has a 23% approval rating in his own country, might berate Trump for political gain, the Mexican president took a rather restrained stance speaking before his guest. </p> <p>He praised Trump for the \u201copen and constructive\u201d conversation they had. The Mexican president also did not directly criticize any of the controversial and racially charged remarks Trump has made since launching his campaign last year. Rather, Pe\u00f1a Nieto rebutted them indirectly by praising Mexican Americans.</p> <p>\u201cThey are honest people, working people \u2013 they are people that respect family, they respect the life in the community and they are respective of the law. As such, Mexicans deserve everybody\u2019s respect.\u201d Although Pe\u00f1a Nieto pointedly defended Nafta, a longstanding target of ire for Trump, he concede the free trade agreement \u201ccould be improved\u201d.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"811c8e5e49aafe501608c2f8f866a26ce747200b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/811c8e5e49aafe501608c2f8f866a26ce747200b/0_472_5362_3218/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Trump Mexico City\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Demonstrators hold placards during a protest against the visit of Donald Trump in Mexico City.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tomas Bravo/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Mexicans reacted with outrage to Pe\u00f1a Nieto\u2019s perceived deference and refusal to be tough with Trump. <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>\u201cI can\u2019t recall a time in the last 50 years when a Mexican president was so thoroughly humiliated in his own home,\u201d said Esteban Illades, editor of the intellectual and current affairs magazine Nexos. <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>\u201cPe\u00f1a Nieto managed to make Trump look presidential while making himself look incredibly small.

The damage is done,\u201d <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://twitter.com/jorgesuarezv/status/771090300102184961\">tweeted</a> author Jorge Su\u00e1rez-V\u00e9lez.</p> <p>On Wednesday evening, Mexico\u2019s foreign minister, Claudia Ruiz Massieu, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ruizmassieu/status/771140787891384320\">tweeted</a> in Spanish that the president had, during the meeting with Trump, \u201cexpressed the grievance and outrage of Mexicans at insults and offenses\u201d.</p> <p>Pe\u00f1a Nieto entered the meeting as Mexico\u2019s most unpopular president since polling on presidential approval started in the mid-1990s. Analysts expect the encounter to diminish Pe\u00f1a Nieto\u2019s popularity even further, especially since many Mexicans were expecting a robust response to a presidential candidate whose protectionist policies could cost Mexico economically. </p> <p>\u201cPe\u00f1a Nieto claims he is just trying to protect Mexicans. How, by welcoming to Mexico the candidate who has portrayed them as the enemy?\u201d said Carlos Bravo Regidor, a journalism professor at the Centre for Research and Teaching in Economics. \u201cThis is more than a diplomatic blunder. This is a mistake of global proportions.\u201d</p> <p>The event was held just hours before Trump\u2019s scheduled speech on immigration in Phoenix, Arizona, and came as the Republican nominee is trying to pivot to appeal to moderate suburban voters that he alienated during his primary campaign. </p> <p>In recent days, Trump has shifted away from <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/27/donald-trump-immigration-policy-deportation\">his calls for \u201ca deportation force\u201d</a> and <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/21/donald-trump-deportation-immigration-plan-meeting-latino-leaders\">deporting all 11 million illegal immigrants</a> in the US within two years of taking office. </p> <p>Instead, he has flip-flopped in the past week about a potential path to legal status for undocumented immigrants and attacked the media for even focusing on the issue. </p> <p>\u201cIn recent days, the media \u2013 as it usually does \u2013 has missed the whole point on immigration. All the media wants to talk about is the 11 million or more people here illegally,\u201d Trump told voters in Iowa on Saturday.</p> <p>The campaign heralded Trump\u2019s trip, where he was accompanied by Alabama senator Jeff Sessions and former New York mayor Rudy Giuliani as a sign of Trump\u2019s statesmanship. </p> <p>In a statement, the Republican vice-presidential nominee, Mike Pence, said: \u201cWhat the American people are seeing today is the kind of decisive president Donald J Trump will be. This meeting begins a relationship where we can talk about the issues we\u2019ve got to resolve between the United States and Mexico, as well as the issues we have in common.\u201d</p> <p>It didn\u2019t publicize this statesmanship as much as it could have. Trump\u2019s campaign intentionally left the traveling press corps in the United States and prevented reporters from coming along, something the campaign treasurer, Jeff DeWit, bragged about at the campaign rally in Phoenix on Wednesday night.</p> <p>John Podesta, the chair of the Clinton campaign, mocked Trump for not pressing for Mexico to pay for the border wall in his meeting with Pe\u00f1a Nieto. </p> <p>\u201cDonald Trump has made his outlandish policy of forcing Mexico to pay for his giant wall the centerpiece of his campaign,\u201d said Podesta. \u201cBut at the first opportunity to make good on his offensive campaign promises, Trump choked. What we saw today from a man who claims to be the ultimate \u2018deal maker\u2019 is that he doesn\u2019t have the courage to advocate for his campaign promises when he\u2019s not in front of a friendly crowd.\u201d</p> <p> After Pe\u00f1a Nieto\u2019s tweet, Podesta revised his statement: \u201cIt turns out Trump didn\u2019t just choke, he got beat in the room and lied about it.\u201d</p>",

Under rules introduced in 2013, there is a binding vote on pay policy every three years, but this has had little or no impact on pay levels. The average FTSE 100 chief executive earns about \u00a36m a year \u2013 150 times the average worker\u2019s income, up from 70 times the average in 2002.</p> <p>There were big votes against some bosses\u2019 pay at AGMs this year, including the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jun/08/sir-martin-sorrell-pay-deal-faces-investor-revolt-at-wpp-agm\">\u00a370m deal for Sir Martin Sorrell</a> at WPP and a majority opposing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/apr/14/bp-pledge-shareholder-anger-ceo-bob-dudleypay-deal\">Bob Dudley\u2019s \u00a314m at BP</a>, but such revolts are still relatively rare and are usually led by the same few fund managers.</p> <p>Philp\u2019s proposals, published by the High Pay Centre campaign group, add to the ongoing debate about pay and governance.

Philp, who backed May for Tory leader, will meet the prime minister\u2019s team next Tuesday to discuss his ideas.</p> <p>Philp said: \u201cShareholders are not engaged and are frankly being a bit lazy. They are not active, energetic custodians of their own capital. A symptom of that is out-of-control executive pay \u2013 not just high amounts but also lack of alignment between pay and performance.\u201d</p> <p>Philp said his proposals were based on rules in countries such as Switzerland, the Netherlands and Denmark, which have binding pay votes, and Sweden, where shareholder committees have increased investor involvement.</p> <p>He said fund managers were paid a lot of money and had the resources to put representatives on the committees. If they chose not to, their decision would be made public and the next biggest shareholder would be asked to attend, he said.</p> <p>Myners, a former chairman of Marks &amp; Spencer, said: \u201cChris Philp\u2019s proposals will not be universally welcomed by either company directors or fund managers because they challenge the existing order that has suited these two communities so well.

  "<p>Victims of crime in England and Wales should be given the right to restorative justice \u2013 where they can confront the criminal who harmed them \u2013 once the criminal justice system develops sufficient capacity, a parliamentary committee is to recommend.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2016/sep/01/have-you-taken-part-in-restorative-justice\">Have you taken part in restorative justice?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But the report by the justice select committee warns that availability of the service is presently subject to a postcode lottery and cautions that it <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/jan/12/restorative-justice-domestic-violence\">may not be appropriate for certain offences</a> \u2013 such as sexual assaults, domestic violence and hate crimes.<br></p> <p>Expanding the role of restorative justice should feature in the <a href=\"http://researchbriefings.parliament.uk/ResearchBriefing/Summary/SN07139\">government\u2019s delayed victims\u2019 law </a> and involve public consultation on the means of enforcing entitlement, the cross-party report proposes. It suggests a \u201ccommencement order\u201d should be brought into effect by a minister \u201conly once he or she has demonstrated to parliament that the system has sufficient capacity\u201d to provide restorative justice services to all victims.</p> <p>\u201cWhile capacity issues mean that it is still too soon to introduce a legislative right to restorative justice for victims, we urge the government to work towards this goal,\u201d Bob Neill, the Conservative chair of the committee, said. \u201cWe heard extensive evidence of the tangible benefits to victims and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/sep/17/restorative-justice-young-offenders-crime\">the role of restorative justice in reducing reoffending</a>, so it clearly benefits wider society as well.\u201d</p> <p>Neill added: \u201cThe priority must be to ensure that victims of crime are properly informed. The Ministry of Justice should focus its resources on ensuring restorative justice is well understood by bodies within the criminal justice system who can then convey this information to victims. A rigorous system should be introduced to improve compliance with the police\u2019s requirement to inform victims \u2013 perhaps something as straightforward as a box at the end of the victim impact statement form.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/may/27/justice-system-failing-witnesses-victims-crime\">Justice system is failing witnesses and victims of crime, say MPs</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Restorative justice usually involves bringing together a victim and the offender in a face-to-face meeting or via video-conferencing. In some cases, trained facilitators pass messages back and forth between them and there is no direct contact. The aim is to make offenders understand the impact of their actions and to help victims repair the emotional damage they have endured. Both victim and perpetrator must be willing participants. </p> <p>Restorative justice is chiefly funded through local police and crime commissioners. In 2013, the coalition government made \u00a329m available over three years but the restorative justice element was not ringfenced. The justice select committee does not support ringfencing finance in future because \u201cit is difficult to predict with certainty how much should be allocated to it\u201d. </p> <p> Public awareness of restorative justice remains relatively low, at 28%. The same poll, however, found that 80% of people questioned thought that victims should have the right to meet their offender.</p> <p>Although restorative justice should, in principle, be available in all cases, the report says, there should be more training for facilitators who are working with sex, domestic violence and hate crimes.<br></p> <p>The committee notes that \u201cthe then home secretary, Rt Hon Theresa May MP, recently criticised the use of restorative justice by police in cases of domestic violence, saying that it does not follow \u2018common sense\u2019 to \u2018sit vulnerable victims\u2019 in the same room as the perpetrator\u201d.</p> <p>It should never be used in what is known as level one restorative justice, the MPs say, where police officers attend a domestic violence incident and attempt to arrange a discussion between the victim and assailant. <br></p> <p>\u201cIt is a matter of great concern to us that level one restorative justice is being used by police forces in cases of domestic abuse,\u201d the report notes. \u201cThis risks bringing restorative justice into disrepute. It is crucial that frontline police officers are fully informed of the risks for vulnerable victims in such cases.\u201d</p> <p>Responding to the report, Jon Collins, chief executive of the <a href=\"https://www.restorativejustice.org.uk/\">Restorative Justice Council</a>, said: \u201cRestorative justice helps victims recover from crime and move on and it should be available to every victim of crime. Embedding a right to restorative justice in legislation would help to achieve this. Urgent steps must also be taken by police and crime commissioners to make sure that restorative justice services are in place in every area in order to make this entitlement a reality.</p> <p>\u201cWhile some types of crime, and particularly domestic abuse, require robust risk management, wherever possible victims themselves should be able to decide whether restorative justice can help them to move on. Restorative justice works \u2013 it cuts crime while helping victims to move on.\u201d</p> <p>In a separate statement Polly Neate, chief executive of Women\u2019s Aid, and Collins said: \u201cWomen\u2019s Aid and the Restorative Justice Council are clear that restorative justice can, in certain circumstances, be useful in domestic abuse cases \u2013 but only if the survivor\u2019s safety remains paramount. <br></p> <p>\u201cThe survivor must feel in control of the process, and it must have no impact on the perpetrator\u2019s criminal sanctions. Restorative justice being used must never be taken as an opportunity to minimise the perpetrator\u2019s crimes or be used as an alternative to a more serious criminal justice sanction. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/jun/10/restorative-justice-heal-relationships-broken-crime\">Restorative justice can help heal relationships broken by crime | Rick Muir</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cSpecialist training on domestic abuse \u2013 and especially coercive control \u2013 must be undertaken by all restorative justice practitioners.

I needed to have that meeting, for me. I didn\u2019t realise the burden I was carrying until it was lifted, until I said out loud how much it had hurt. I felt 10ft tall. I felt a lot lighter in every aspect. </p> <p>\u201cI could always talk to other people about it but they had not been there. He was the person I needed to tell what he had done. It helped me.

It was a truly outstanding performance and enhances Britain\u2019s status as the world\u2019s leading elite cycling nation.</p> <p>You were widely reported in the media as saying that there will be \u201cno limits\u201d on the honours that could be bestowed on our medal winners. But the best way to honour the achievements of our athletes would be a legacy of every-day cycling in this country \u2013 a place where cycling is the choice form of transport for people to get around in their daily lives.</p> <p>Your predecessor called for a \u201ccycling revolution\u201d and your government\u2019s manifesto sets out a target to \u201cdouble\u201d the number of journeys cycled. While some steps have been made, cycling is still a transport mode which does not enjoy the government investment or political leadership given to roads, rail or aviation.</p> <p>The government is now considering feedback on the draft Cycling and Walking Investment Strategy (CWIS). We urge the government to publish this and set out a timeline to address the chronic underfunding and lack of leadership which is keeping cycling for transport in the slow lane. Only networks of segregated cycle lanes in towns and cities across the country can achieve and influence growth.</p> <p>The success of the CWIS will be felt not only across government but in all areas of the nation\u2019s life.</p> <p>The government\u2019s sports strategy seeks to extend the number of people living physically active lives and could be truly transformative. Active travel \u2013 walking and cycling \u2013 is the easiest way for people of all ages to fit physical activity into their lives. Currently, only one in five people achieve the recommended levels of physical activity.</p> <p>Around one in three children is overweight or obese. The government\u2019s childhood obesity strategy recognises the value of physical activity and the importance of walking and cycling to school. I am sure you know that this will seem a fanciful idea for most parents without the convenient walking and cycling routes which would give them the confidence that their children will be safe getting to school. Yet we know it can be achieved \u2013 in the Netherlands, 50% of education-age children cycle to school.</p> <p>As cities like Copenhagen and New York have shown, cycling also creates better places to live and work. More cycling cuts congestion, reduces noise pollution and fuels local economies. Small businesses in New York have seen a 49% increase in business where cycle lanes have been installed.</p> <p>There is huge latent demand for cycling. Two thirds of people would cycle more if they felt safer on the roads. The government\u2019s road safety statement reiterates the manifesto commitment to reduce the number of cyclists killed or injured. The CWIS needs to set targets to improve road maintenance, enhance enforcement of the laws, and update the rules of the road to better consider the needs of cyclists.</p> <p>To make this happen, we need 5% of the government\u2019s transport spend allocated to cycling. This is the only way that cycling will be integrated into transport strategy and given the priority it deserves.</p> <p>Investment in cycling as a form of transport isn\u2019t purely an investment in cycle lanes. It is an investment that will pay off for the nation\u2019s health, wealth, transport infrastructure and the vibrancy of our towns and cities. It has the added benefit of just making it easier for ordinary families to get to work and get to school.</p> <p>Our athletes have inspired the country and now we urge the government to take cycling seriously as a transport option for everyone.</p> <p>British Cycling\u2019s policy adviser Chris Boardman would welcome a meeting to discuss this further.

  "<p>When Erin was 17, she went along to a seminar with her year 11 class where she was told not to photograph herself naked \u2013 and definitely<em> </em>not to send such a picture to someone else.<br></p> <p>An older woman who had experienced first-hand how badly it could go wrong warned that repercussions could come at once, if the image was shared without her consent, or in the future, if it came to the attention of potential employers.</p> <p>Exactly how that might happen, Erin wasn\u2019t sure. But she describes herself as an ambitious and \u201cpretty innocent little teenager\u201d back then \u2013 taking such images hadn\u2019t really crossed her mind.</p> <p>\u201cThe overwhelming message that I personally took away from that was to never ever share naked photos or something terrible would happen.

But one of the challenges is changing the conversation when the curriculum and the law are already well out of step with the technology and the culture.</p> <p> Figures for the prevalence of sexting are hard to come by. A <a href=\"http://www.pewinternet.org/2009/12/15/teens-and-sexting/\">Pew Research Center study from 2009</a> found only 4% of 12- to 17-year-olds who owned cellphones had sent such images (though 15% had received them from others); an Australian study of 11- to 16-year-olds from 2011 found similar rates.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>You\u2019d send them to your boyfriend, if you had a boyfriend, but you wouldn\u2019t send to someone at school</p> <footer> <cite>Sophie, 19, from Sydney</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p> A <a href=\"http://www.cosmopolitan.com/sex-love/advice/a30675/ninety-percent-millennial-women-take-nude-photos-cosmo-survey/\">2014 survey of 850 Cosmopolitan readers</a> \u2013 99% female, with an average age of 21 \u2013 found nearly 90% had taken nude photographs of themselves at some point, and of that figure, only 14% regretted it.</p> <p> Teenagers spoken to by Guardian Australia suggested that it is far from universal, and more common among older teenagers in relationships.</p> <p>\u201cI think, quite generally amongst my peers, nudes aren\u2019t very common and it\u2019s more like when you\u2019re in a relationship,\u201d says 16-year-old Ellie from Canberra. \u201cGirls have been told how terribly it can end.\u201d</p> <p>Some of them have seen that with their own eyes, Ellie says. Friends of hers have had images circulated without their consent; it was an \u201cawful experience\u201d. </p> <p> Sophie, a 19-year-old, says there \u201cwasn\u2019t really a big culture\u201d of sending or sharing them at her co-ed high school in Sydney. \u201cYou\u2019d send them to your boyfriend, if you had a boyfriend, but you wouldn\u2019t send to someone at school. Nobody really asked.\u201d</p> <p> Better documented \u2013 and at the crux of this issue \u2013 are teenagers\u2019 relationships with the internet. <a href=\"http://www.pewinternet.org/2015/04/09/teens-social-media-technology-2015/\">Another Pew Research Center study last year</a> said nearly three-quarters of teenagers had or had access to a smartphone, and 24% were online \u201calmost constantly\u201d. Many also <a href=\"http://www.pewinternet.org/online-romance/\">initiated or enacted romantic relationships</a> on social media.</p> <p> Two in five teenagers \u2013 and particularly older girls \u2013 were using Snapchat, a photo- and video-sharing app where messages disappear after a maximum of 10 seconds. (Images can be captured as screenshots but the sender is notified and doing so is seen as a social faux pas.)</p> <p> Because of its ephemeral nature, it has been depicted as a \u201csexting\u201d app. While it\u2019s true that teenagers (and adults) use it for that purpose, of the <a href=\"https://cewe-photoworld.com/how-big-is-snapchat/\">8,800 images reportedly shared</a> on Snapchat every second, the vast majority would be pedestrian: food, school, work, pets, travel, public transport and (clothed) selfies.</p> <p> If it sounds mundane, it is. Somewhat paradoxically, Snapchat is where you might share images that are too intimate or too banal for other social media platforms. A feature this month about the <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.wired.com/2016/08/how-teens-use-social-media/\">social media lives of teenagers</a> told of them exchanging pictures of their shoes and bedroom ceilings \u201cjust to keep the streak going\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThe point is that everyone\u2019s Snapchats all kind of suck,\u201d the journalist concluded.</p> <p> \u201cI send nudes to my boyfriend,\u201d says Sophie, then corrects herself as though the word seems too laboured. \u201cNot like <em>nudes</em>, I don\u2019t go out of my way \u2026 I don\u2019t know, it\u2019s fun.</p> <p>\u201cOn Snapchat you just send two-second nudes \u2013 the guy\u2019s like, \u2018Oh, damn,\u2019 and you\u2019re like, \u2018ha ha.\u2019 I\u2019ve never sent nudes to anyone who I thought would ever in a million years share them.\u201d</p> <p>The casualness, even levity with which many young people approach nude selfies is at odds with the potential consequences under commonwealth law, which says it is illegal to use mobile phones to create, transmit or possess material defined as \u201cchild pornography material\u201d or \u201cchild abuse material\u201d.</p> <p>Though the intention is to regulate explicit images of children, not consensual behaviour between children, if you are under 18 and photograph or film your naked body, the effect may be the same. In some cases, this is at odds with the age of consent.</p> <p>Some teenagers spoken to by Guardian Australia were aware that this was the law, but not all.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/aug/17/police-investigate-claims-schoolgirls-across-australia-targeted-by-site-hosting-explicit-images\">Police are continuing to investigate a website</a>, believed to be hosted overseas, which encourages Australian students to upload explicit images of their female peers. But while several young people have been convicted under similar laws in the US, the likelihood of an Australian teenager being charged with creating or sharing explicit images is slim.</p> <p>In 2010, in one of the few cases in Australia to emerge publicly, an 18-year-old man from western Sydney was charged over exchanging naked and semi-naked pictures with a 13-year-old girl. The girl\u2019s father found the photos on her phone and complained to police. There was no indication that the man had shared the images, nor that their relationship had been physical. He was eventually released on a good behaviour bond, without an offence recorded.</p> <p>By contrast, taking or sharing intimate images without the consent of the adult pictured, a practice commonly referred to as \u201crevenge porn\u201d, is not illegal \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/feb/25/senate-committee-recommends-the-criminalisation-of-revenge-porn\">despite recommendations of a Senate committee that it be criminalised</a>.<br></p> <p>The discrepancy is illustrative of a law that aims to police the culture of taking intimate images, rather than the crime of sharing them non-consensually. The repercussions of having a selfie shared without consent are far more likely to be social than criminal, and disproportionately borne by women.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>In 2010 an organisation called ThinkUKnow \u2013 a partnership between the Australian federal police, NineMSN, and Microsoft Australia, among others \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DwKgg35YbC4\">produced a two-minute video</a> warning young people about the dangers of sexually charged or explicit photos.</p> <p>In Megan\u2019s Story, a teenage girl sends a selfie \u2013 of her wearing her bra, it\u2019s implied \u2013 to a boy in her class, who forwards it around their classmates. The girls react with disgust; the boys smirk. When it reaches her teacher\u2019s cellphone, he stares into middle distance, disappointed. Megan flees from the classroom in tears.</p> <p>\u201cThink you know what happens to your images?\u201d asks a mature male voiceover. \u201cWho will see them? How they will affect you?

He says that perspective is only reinforced by the absence of repercussion.</p> <p>\u201cOne of the reasons I think this is still going on is we blame the victim almost every single time, whether it\u2019s rape or nudes.\u201d (He, and others spoken to by Guardian Australia, said the trade in nude selfies was especially rife at all-boys\u2019 schools.)</p> <p>This double standard is felt keenly by young women, who are more likely to be told not take intimate images of themselves than their male peers are to be told not to share any they are sent.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Selfies can be a diary, or a dialogue, or a communication like, \u2018Hey, thinking of you, here\u2019s a picture'</p> <footer> <cite>Kath Albury</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/aug/19/explicit-website-that-targeted-australian-schoolgirls-shut-down\">A parent complained that</a> that, in the wake of the news of a website sharing explicit images, female students at Kambrya College in Melbourne\u2019s south-east were told to lower their skirts, refuse their boyfriends\u2019 requests for a \u201csexy selfie\u201d, and otherwise \u201cprotect their integrity\u201d.

Particularly in this case, where the nuances \u2013 yes, nuances \u2013 of nude selfies don\u2019t typically translate across generations.</p> <p>For a generation that communicates visually, photos are limitless in the meanings they can convey.</p> <p>\u201cSelfies can be a diary, or a dialogue, or a communication like, \u2018Hey, thinking of you, here\u2019s a picture,\u2019 or they can be entirely for self-reflection,\u201d Kath Albury says. \u201cIf you are of a culture where taking a picture just to say hi or \u2018I\u2019m thinking of you\u2019 is a valid form of everyday communication, then why would that not also be part of a flirtation or sexual relationship?\u201d</p> <p>For a qualitative study Albury co-authored in April 2013, she spoke to 16- and 17-year-olds, who told her that rates and repercussions of so-called \u201csexting\u201d were overblown in the media. They did not use that term themselves, describing it as inherently negative, even sinister: \u201cpictures\u201d, some interviewees suggested, only became \u201csexting\u201d when someone was offended. </p> <p>Young people saw it as an \u201cordinary or mundane practice\u201d, says Albury, but by no means a universal one.</p> <p>In many cases, teenagers told her that adults construed sexual statements where that was not their intention; she gave the example of teachers or parents accusing a young girl of \u201csexualising yourself\u201d by simply pouting in a selfie, or taking a picture of herself wearing a new bra to show her friends.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s saying, \u2018You may not think you\u2019re sexual, but you are,\u2019\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s a kind of insistence that they must see themselves through adults\u2019 eyes \u2013 they\u2019re quite resentful of that.\u201d</p> <p>As confronting as it is for adults to see teenagers documenting themselves in a state of undress, it is distressing for teenagers to be told they are \u201cpornographic\u201d when, in many cases, that was not their intention, says Albury.</p> <p>But this generation gap is one reason the issue feels so fraught: it perfectly intersects fears of new technology, young women\u2019s sexuality, and celebrity culture that tend to divide old and young.</p> <p>Similarly counter-productive, says Albury, is the \u201cdebate\u201d over whether nude selfies are empowering or demeaning \u2013 \u201cas though there\u2019s this huge continuum and it\u2019s got to be at one end or the other. We say that about Kim Kardashian all the time.\u201d</p> <p>She is in favour of changing the law to better accommodate teenagers\u2019 self-taken photos, as well as to punish non-consensual sharing, pointing to an <a href=\"https://www.legalaid.vic.gov.au/find-legal-answers/sex-and-law/sexting-and-child-pornography\">amendment bill passed in Victoria</a> as evidence to show how exceptions can be made.</p> <p>Since 2 November 2014, no one can be prosecuted in the state for taking explicit images of themselves. It is also not an offence if you are under 18 and no person pictured is more than two years younger than you, and the photo does not depict a serious criminal offence.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>If somebody sends you a picture of their naked body, there\u2019s a certain amount of trust there: don\u2019t breach that trust</p> <footer> <cite>Anne-Frances Watson</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>But Albury is clear that the issue should be principally approached from the perspective not of criminality, not of prohibition, but of harm minimisation. She suggests addressing nude selfies as part of education under way about consent and respectful relationships \u2013 \u201ca kind of etiquette, if you like, in the digital space \u2026 rather than a technological, scary problem\u201d.</p> <p>It\u2019s reasonable to assume that the stigma around intimate images may lessen with time. But for as long as it persists, young women need to be taught how best to assess the risk of taking them.</p> <p>Anne-Frances Watson says young men <em>and </em>women should be given \u201cpractical information\u201d, like keeping their faces and any identifying features out of pictures: \u201cThat\u2019s a start,\u201d she says.</p> <p>\u201cThen it should be more of a focus on the people who are sharing those images \u2013 that\u2019s disgraceful behaviour,\u201d she says. \u201cIf somebody sends you a picture of their naked body, there\u2019s a certain amount of trust there: don\u2019t breach that trust.\u201d</p> <p>The current approach of telling young women not to take such photos is failing on both fronts: practical and ideological.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re always warned that the images we publish are up on the internet forever, but we\u2019re never given proper advice for what to do if we\u2019re being exploited,\u201d says Amy, a 15-year-old in Melbourne.</p> <p>And victims are paying the price, she adds.</p> <p>\u201cTheir personal images were exploited, their trust was betrayed \u2013 ultimately, they\u2019re the ones who are going to lay awake at night, thinking about what they have done.\u201d </p> <p>\u2022 <em>All the names of the young people interviewed for this article have been changed</em></p>",
  "<p>A United Airlines jet flying from Houston, Texas, to London Heathrow has made an emergency landing at Shannon airport in Ireland after \u201csevere and unexpected turbulence\u201d left 16 people injured.</p> <p>Fourteen passengers and two crew members were taken to hospital. One flight attendant had a suspected broken arm and the other was bleeding from a cut head. <br></p> <p>Gregory Giagnocavo, a telecoms investor and entrepreneur from Colorado in the US, was on the United Airlines flight when it suddenly plummeted four times. <br></p> <p>\u201cThese were petrifying, enormous drops. A part of me didn\u2019t know if we were going to make it. It was that bad,\u201d he said. \u201cI gripped the armrest and thought whether the next sound was going to be hitting the water.\u201d <br></p> <p>The pilots contacted Shannon air traffic control airport seeking permission to land due to a \u201cmedical situation on board\u201d, according to the airline.</p> <p>Ambulance crews were dispatched to the runway and picked up the injured passengers when the plane landed at 5.55am on Wednesday. The Boeing 767-300 jet had 207 passengers and 13 crew members on board and had been due to arrive at Heathrow at about 7am.</p> <p>\u201cThe aircraft diverted to Shannon airport in Ireland where it was met by medical personnel,\u201d said an airline spokesman. \u201cUnited Airlines is providing care and support to customers and crew of flight UA880 \u2026 We wish these passengers and crew a quick recovery from their injuries.\u201d</p> <p>The injured were taken to University hospital Limerick. Eleven of the injured patients were discharged within four-and-a-half hours of the flight landing. Another plane was arranged to fly the final stretch of the journey to Heathrow just after midday while the jet remained in Shannon for investigators to assess.</p> <p>Giagnocavo said many passengers were trying to sleep through the overnight flight and were strapped in. \u201cIt fell four times in a row,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was a tremendous pull on the body. And on the third or fourth time babies starting waking up and crying, people were waking up disorientated.</p> <p>\u201cI thought: this is not turbulence. This is what feels like a life-threatening drop. This is not like any feeling I have had. This is immediately like an experience of being fired from a cannon.</p> <p>\u201cIt pulls you down so hard then it stops for a second and then it does that four times in a row. If you didn\u2019t have your seatbelt on you would have smashed your head.\u201d</p> <p>The Irish Aviation Authority (IAA) said the incident would be investigated. <br></p> <p>According to the US Federal Aviation Administration, most injuries from turbulence occur when passengers are not wearing seatbelts. Most turbulence-related accidents happen at about 9,000 metres (30,000ft).</p>",

Now, let\u2019s quash this idea that PSG were deadset against selling David Luiz. Although they did not plan to flog his in this window, the club\u2019s new manager, Unai Emery, made it clear in the summer that he intended to make Thiago Silva and Marquinhos his first choice partnership in central defence. So David Luiz was dispensable, all the more so after giving away a ludicrous penalty against Monaco last Sunday. He can be brilliant player and is a wonderful character but that goofy streak still runs through him. It\u2019s going to be interesting to see how he gets on under Conte.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57c7297be4b04fe839bc5345\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-08-31T19:03:12.007Z\">8.03pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Almost done deal klaxon</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>I\u2019ve just spotted TV footage Jack Wilshere has been pictured posing with Eddie Howe and a Bournemouth shirt.

His availability had sparked interest from over 20 clubs from England and abroad, though Wilshere considered the offers from Bournemouth, Crystal Palace, Roma and Milan at length.</p> <p>While he was willing to move overseas and spoke with the former Tottenham Hotspur director of football, Franco Baldini, who is now working as a transfer consultant for Roma about a move, Arsenal rejected the proposal put forward by the Italian club. Regardless, it was the proposals from the two Premier League clubs which the 24-year-old considered the most appealing after talks with Eddie Howe and Alan Pardew respectively on Tuesday. Arsenal would not countenance his departure to a club they consider a direct rival for a top four finish.</p> <p>Palace had appeared to be in pole position to secure the player, who has been omitted from Sam Allardyce\u2019s first England squad despite being in Roy Hodgson\u2019s party for Euro 2016. Yet, with Wilshere having not completed a full 90 minutes in a Premier League game since September 2014, it is understood the south London club were seeking to pay only a proportion of the player\u2019s \u00a390,000-a-week wages.</p> <p>Bournemouth, in contrast, are to meet the player\u2019s entire salary, making a move to the Vitality stadium more appealing to Arsenal. The player travelled down to the south coast club on Wednesday afternoon. Arsenal have sold Serge Gnabry to Werder Bremen, with the Germany Olympic player suggesting he was moving to the Bundesliga \u201cto get playing time, to develop further and to help the team\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"43bc54791ad7dc80c1a2b17a893b3ded371aeb31\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/43bc54791ad7dc80c1a2b17a893b3ded371aeb31/0_196_2329_1397/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jack Wilshere\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jack Wilshere will sign on loan for Bournemouth, subject to passing a medical.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Adam Davy/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57c70e5de4b0f6cb85628b1a\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-08-31T17:10:31.154Z\">6.10pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Some Celtic news ...</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Celtic defender Emilio Izaguirre has failed in his efforts to find himself a new club and will be staying with the Scottish champions until January.

Whether Valencia is the answer, is another matter. Over to you for the verdict on that one, Mr Steinberg. Leo Ulloa was on Swansea\u2019s list of targets earlier in the summer but I was told yesterday that he\u2019s not being considered now. Understand Ulloa\u2019s representatives held talks with Leicester about his future first thing this morning. Seems certain to go and has options in the Premier League (Sunderland) and in Spain.</p> <p><em>To answer your question, Stu, Enner Valencia had a promising start at West Ham, scoring that stunner at Hull and linking up well with Diafra Sakho. But he looked lost whenever he played without the more muscular Sakho and suffered a bad knee injury last summer.

The England midfielder has offers from virtually half the Premier League to consider - Arsenal will not countenance him moving to a direct rival for a top four place - as well as Roma, Celtic and Valencia from abroad. But, with a young family, he may be more enticed by the prospect of moving to Palace, Bournemouth or Watford.</p> <p>The south London club are privately hopeful a deal will be concluded today and, with Yohan Cabaye having withdrawn from the France squad with a knee injury which is still being assessed, he will be needed in a side desperately lacking in creativity.

Brahimi moved to Porto in 2014 for around \u00a35m, although 80% of that fee was paid by investment group Doyen Sports. </p> <p>Capable of playing on either wing or in the No10 role, Brahimi scored seven league goals in both of his two seasons in Portugal. He is currently on international duty with Algeria ahead of their African Nations Cup qualifier against Lesotho. </p> <p>Despite reports in Italy on Tuesday that Everton\u2019s had ended their interest in Gabbiadini, it is understood that a deal could still be reached for the Italy striker.

On top of that, if she signs over ownership to the city, for resale, she will still have to keep making loan payments for a car she no longer possesses.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>\u201cOh god, it\u2019s been a nightmare,\u201d Harjo, who works in customer service for Southwest Airlines, said. \u201cI\u2019m losing sleep over it, thinking, \u2018Oh god I have to pay this loan\u2019 and I can\u2019t buy another car until I pay this loan off.

That\u2019s why they\u2019re going after innocent people like Arlene, and that\u2019s why they\u2019re not following the reform law.\u201d</p> <p>On Wednesday, city attorney Jessica Hernandez said in an email: \u201cThe City\u2019s DWI forfeiture ordinance is exempt from the New Mexico civil forfeiture act according to the state law\u2019s own terms. The City\u2019s program is a narrowly-tailored nuisance abatement law to protect the public from dangerous, repeat DWI offenders and the vehicles they use to commit DWI offenses, placing innocent citizens\u2019 lives and property at risk. The ordinance provides protections for innocent owners to get their vehicles back at an early stage in the process. Like all cases, we will review and evaluate this case\u2019s individual circumstances.\u201d</p> <p>In April, Harjo\u2019s son borrowed her Nissan to go to the gym, but was then pulled over for drunk driving and the car was impounded.</p> <p>\u201cI went [to court] the first time,\u201d Harjo said, \u201cand they told me they wanted me to sign a disclaimer\u201d to transfer ownership of the car to the city for re-sale. Or she had to pay the city $4,000. \u201cI told them I didn\u2019t have $4,000.\u201d<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>The government continued to pressure Harjo to sign the disclaimer, but she fought back, at first representing herself and then with the help of the Institute for Justice, a group that has campaigned against civil asset forfeiture. \u201cThe judge [was] making me feel like it was my fault, making me feel like I\u2019d done something wrong, making me feel intimidated,\u201d she said.</p> <p>On Wednesday, Johnson and Harjo filed both an <a href=\"http://ij.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Harjo-Amended-Answer-Aug-2016-IJ080892xA6322.pdf\">answer</a> to the government\u2019s civil forfeiture suit, and a counter-claim and separate civil action challenging the legality and constitutionality of Albuquerque\u2019s civil asset forfeiture program.</p> <p>The Institute for Justice has tried to challenge the program in court before, in a <a href=\"https://www.abqjournal.com/678063/state-senators-sue-albuquerque-over-its-seizures.html\">November 2015 lawsuit</a> brought by two state senators against the city. But a judge dismissed the case, saying that the legislators were not the appropriate parties to bring the case.</p> <p>\u201cThis is something we\u2019ve been watching, and want to stop \u2013 because of the size of the program, but also New Mexico\u2019s reforms, which were some of the first and still some of the most protective reforms in the country,\u201d Johnson said. </p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s important to us to see those reforms implemented, so local governments are not able to create what amounts to a loophole,\u201d he added.</p> <p>\u201cThe city\u2019s program is a narrowly-tailored nuisance abatement law to protect the public from dangerous, repeat DWI offenders and the vehicles they use to commit DWI offenses, placing innocent citizens\u2019 lives and property at risk,\u201d city attorney Jessica Hernandez said in a statement. \u201cThe ordinance provides protections for innocent owners to get their vehicles back at an early stage in the process.

  "<p>Johanna Konta collapsed to her knees midway through her match in stifling heat at the US Open before recovering to record an astonishing and controversial win in three sets over the Bulgarian Tsvetana Pironkova. The incident sent a worrying shiver through the tournament as high humidity drained even the fittest players \u2013 and few are better conditioned than the British No1.</p> <p>A set up but fading physically towards the end of the second on an exposed outside court, Konta served on set point against her, fell woozily to the ground and was seriously distressed as she grabbed for her breath. For seven minutes she sat on a towel with ice packs wrapped around her before waving away concerned attendants to sit on her courtside chair. She rose unsteadily and returned to double-fault and surrender the set, then left the court to change her clothes before resuming.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/31/andy-murray-us-open-marcel-granollers-second-round\">Andy Murray ready to face Marcel Granollers in US Open second round</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Although still breathing hard and looking less than great, Konta conjured a magnificent comeback, full of artful drop shots, lobs and passing shots, to win 6-2, 5-7, 6-2 in two hours and 32 minutes. She was so exhausted she could not celebrate. If she is fit, she will play on Friday against the Swiss Belinda Bencic, who beat Andrea Petkovic 6-3, 6-2.</p> <p>Konta, who revealed she had collapsed in similar conditions in the United States four years ago, said, \u201cI was feeling a little bit the conditions, and also my own energy levels [crashed]. Basically my heart rate spiked and I couldn\u2019t really control my breathing. I started hyperventilating. I started shaking. That\u2019s why I went down on the ground, because I was quite violently shaking.</p> <p>\u201cBecause I\u2019d experienced it once before I didn\u2019t start crying. I don\u2019t know if anyone\u2019s had a panic attack but that\u2019s basically what it feels like. I\u2019m doing everything I can to recover well and try to get myself into a state to be ready to compete again on Thursday, Friday. I don\u2019t know what day it is. I feel quite certain that, with some TLC, I\u2019ll be good to go again in a few days\u2019 time.\u201d</p> <p>Konta denied she had manipulated the situation for an extended break between sets. \u201cThe medical timeout was right at the end of that second set. I guess it worked out that way but I needed to get changed out of my clothes. I was soaked through. I did the best I could with the cards that I had. My opponent, she was gracious, and she was also very understanding of the situation that was going on.\u201d</p> <p>Pironkova said Konta deserved her win but she described the conditions as: \u201cNot that bad compared to other days\u201d.</p> <p>She added: \u201cObviously, she wasn\u2019t feeling well. I could see that. When you see the player that you\u2019re playing against look like this, that you couldn\u2019t stand, it\u2019s scary, I think. I was hoping she will get through that and that she will be OK.</p> <p>\u201cWhat was frustrating for me was what happened after that, the toilet break. Because, with that toilet break, I think the match was stopped for just too long. And it was an unfortunate time. I had my momentum going. I was getting back in the match because I had a hard start.\u201d</p> <p>Pironkova did not notice any change in Konta at the end. \u201cI couldn\u2019t say her game was struggling or anything. She played the same way that she played before.\u201d</p> <p>Kyle Edmund had a way more straightforward route into the third round than his compatriot. The forehand he put beyond the reach of the young American underdog Ernesto \u201cNito\u201d Escobedo to win their second-round match was the British player\u2019s 54th clean winner of the match, his 94th of the tournament.</p> <p>If the 21-year-old Yorkshireman is to create an even bigger stir by beating John Isner in the third round on Friday, he will need all the gathering strength in that strong, freckled right arm to reach the second week of the tournament.</p> <p>Edmund\u2019s cannon is his forehand and that is where 49 of his winners have come from in the space of three days, with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/29/kyle-edmund-richard-gasquet-us-open-first-round\" title=\"\">straight-sets wins over the still-dangerous Frenchman Richard Gasquet</a> on Monday and the Californian Escobedo, the wiry 20-year-old son a of Mexican truck driver.</p> <p>\u201cA lot of good things today,\u201d Edmund said courtside after winning 7-5, 6-4, 6-4 \u2013 and before he had heard Isner had beaten the Belgian qualifier Steve Darcis in four sets on Louis Armstrong.</p>",
  "<p>Federal and state officials are investigating the shooting deaths of California sea otters, after the bodies of four male otters were found washed up on beaches near Santa Cruz.</p> <p>On Monday, the US Fish and Wildlife Service announced a <a href=\"https://cdfgnews.wordpress.com/2016/08/29/sea-otter-shootings-in-santa-cruz-county/\">$10,000 reward</a> for information that leads to the arrest and conviction of the person responsible for killing three sea otters that were found between 12-19 August. </p> <p>A fourth otter carcass was discovered on 20 August with a suspected gunshot wound, Ashley Spratt of the Fish and Wildlife Service said on Wednesday. </p> <p>\u201cFinding several gunshot sea otters at the same general location during such a short time frame is very unusual,\u201d said Spratt.</p> <p>\u201cWe don\u2019t know why these otters were shot, but what\u2019s important to note is that killing or harassing federally protected wildlife is a crime.\u201d</p> <p>Sea otters are protected by the Marine Mammal Protection Act, California state law and the Endangered Species Act. Killing a sea otter is punishable by fines up to $100,000 and could result in a jail sentence. </p> <p>Sea otters were once widespread along the Pacific coast, but the mammals were hunted almost to extinction for their pelts during the 18th and 19th centuries. </p> <p>In 1977, California\u2019s remaining sea otters were listed as \u201cthreatened\u201d under the Endangered Species Act. </p> <p>\u201cThey\u2019re a keystone species. They help play a role in the broader ecosystem,\u201d said Spratt. \u201cSo with the loss of these sea otters, we also have the loss of their benefit to the ecosystem.\u201d </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/aug/09/endangered-tortoise-shells-painted-florida-wildlife\">Wildlife officials urge people to stop painting endangered turtle shells</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Today sea otters are primarily threatened by oil spills and coastal tanker traffic, Spratt said, although otter killings by humans are not unheard of.</p> <p>In September 2013, three dead otters were found near Asilomar state beach, an unsolved crime that Spratt said is now considered a \u201ccold case\u201d. </p> <p>The otter carcasses have been transported to the US Fish and Wildlife forensic lab in Oregon, where they are undergoing necropsies.<br></p>",
  "<p>Australia fans still missing Oceania after 10 years in Asia should take a look at New Zealand. While the Socceroos prepare for Iraq on Thursday, the first of 10 intense games in the final round of qualification for the 2018 World Cup, the All Whites have no competitive action until back-to-back games with New Caledonia in November.</p> <p>The past two Asian campaigns under Pim Verbeek and Holger Osieck have been free from stress \u2013 but also excitement. Under Ange Postecoglou, the football should be easier on the eye but whether they will be as easy on the heart remains to be seen.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/aug/28/josh-risdon-called-up-for-socceroos-with-bailey-wright-out-of-iraq-clash\">Josh Risdon called up for Socceroos with Bailey Wright out of Iraq clash</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The format is pretty much the same. The top two teams go through automatically while the third-placed enters the play-offs. Japan and Australia are the favourites but in contrast to the past, this time there are other teams with genuine hopes of going to the World Cup.</p> <p>The United Arab Emirates, where Australia will appear five days after Perth, is one. The Whites showed their talent at the 2015 Asian Cup, finishing third and are desperate to make hay while the so-called \u201cgolden generation\u201d shines. Most of their stars \u2013 Omar Abdulrahman, Ali Mabkhout and Ahmed Khalil \u2013 were not even born in 1990, the last and only time the country featured at the World Cup. They have come through the ranks together, and most recently met up at a month-long training camp in Spain. The UAE are better prepared than anyone.</p> <p>October brings Saudi Arabia. Coach Bert Van Marwijk has introduced a certain level of organisation and pragmatism to the Green Falcons who have lost their way and Asian powerhouse status in recent years. There will be danger in Jeddah. Striker Mohammad Al-Sahlawi scores a goal a game for his country and there will also be a strong desire, in some parts, for revenge on Australia after Al Hilal lost to Western Sydney Wanderers in a bitter final of the 2o14 Asian Champions League.</p> <p>Five days after that is a game in Melbourne and the usual 1-1 draw with Japan. The Samurai Blue are looking to forget disappointing performances at the 2014 World Cup and the 2015 Asian Cup \u2013 and to a lesser extent the Rio Olympics. These games will be the biggest test so far for coach Vahid Halilhodzic after 18 months in the job but the talent is there to reach a sixth successive World Cup.</p> <p>The first half of the final round of qualification is completed in Bangkok in November.&#xa0;Officially&#xa0;the weakest of the six on paper, Thailand are&#xa0;much-improved from the team that pushed Osieck\u2019s side all the way in two qualifiers four years ago.<br></p> <p>Coach Kiatisuk Senamuang is close to his players and has introduced a pass and move groove inevitably labelled \u201cThai tiki-taka\u201d. The whole set-up is more professional, organised and co-ordinated than in the past with players that are better, fitter and familiar with each other. In the past there was perhaps too much respect shown to Australia but that will no longer be the case.</p> <p>But first up is Iraq, that most mercurial of Middle Eastern teams. In terms of raw talent, few in Asia come close but there is also an impressive ability to put bullets in their own twinkle toes.</p> <p>Younis Mahmoud has retired and this time it could be permanent. Despite his ability to get a goal when it is really needed, not all will miss the Desert Fox. A succession of foreign coaches have left Iraq muttering about the oversized influence of the striker. In a recent game against Syria, was it a coincidence that he turned to the bench during the game and held up seven fingers only for number seven to be substituted moments later?</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/picture/2016/jul/14/david-squires-on-the-socceroos-2006-world-cup-playoff-against-uruguay\">David Squires on ... the Socceroos' 2005 World Cup playoff against Uruguay</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Without Younis, the team is more fluid, flexible and free. The football played at the Olympics was, at times, a delight to watch and while the team may have left Brazil unbeaten, there was frustration at missing out on the quarter-finals. The inability to score was the problem and that could well be the same with the senior team too.</p> <p>There are some excellent players. You can have Dhurgham Ismael, the young left-back and stand out at the 2015 Asian Cup and Udinese\u2019s Ali Adnan whose rampaging runs have earned the nickname of \u201cAsia\u2019s Gareth Bale\u201d. Ali Husni is a talented winger who provides craft and&#xa0;creativity&#xa0;and there is England-based Yaser Kasim to offer&#xa0;control in the middle.</p> <p>Fans in Perth could be in for a treat and whatever happens, it is just the beginning. Five days later, the Socceroos will be half a world away in Abu Dhabi. The distances in Asia are also an opponent that provides challenges to all but after 10 years as a member, Australia would surely not have it any other way.</p>",

As tiny Amelia and I watched a happy couple cutting the cake, she said, \u2018Why don\u2019t you and Mum get married?\u2019 It was one of those moments when a question from a child\u2019s mouth meant I heard it in a fresh way, as if for the first time.</p> <p>\u201cHomosexuality is all about family. It is about fear of rejection from your blood family if you tell them the truth. It is about the almost universal trauma of breaking the silence and \u2018coming out\u2019 to your mum and dad and then extended family. Sometimes it is about a lifelong silence with your family of origin because saying the word \u2018homosexuality\u2019 out aloud is simply unimaginable. It is about reconciliation with your blood family, often over decades. Or it is about a lifetime of fracture because it is utterly unacceptable.</p> <p>\u201cMarriage is about family formation. It is a public celebration of the birth of a new family. It is a legal contract and a love contract. It is a new beginning. This is why many of us in the gay community care so much about marriage and why we will keep knocking on the door until it opens, as it has in our sister democracies in the UK, Canada, the US and beyond.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/30/only-one-person-has-something-to-gain-from-a-marriage-equality-plebiscite\">Only one person has something to gain from a marriage equality plebiscite | Peter Lewis</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cOur children, Amelia and Luke are grown up now.

One of its borders runs through the majestic Blue Mountains just west of Sydney and it was one of the country\u2019s earliest regions to be colonised by British invaders.

Language \u201cdoesn\u2019t belong to people, it belongs to the land you live on\u201d. Back then if a person were to \u201cgo to another man\u2019s country and speak his own language, he\u2019s being disrespectful to the land and to the people\u201d. It was an etiquette of travel not observed by the white-skinned newcomers.</p> <p>Grant was a baby when his family lived at Condobolin mission but doesn\u2019t remember much about mission life because, at five, he moved with his family and seven or eight other families to the New South Wales town of Griffith, more than 200km away. \u201cIt took a couple of weeks because we walked and rode pushbikes and rode horses and carts.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"58806e1bd4ec69371fd5e80fa02a6b4addc41bc4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/58806e1bd4ec69371fd5e80fa02a6b4addc41bc4/0_0_384_511/376.jpg\" alt=\"Stan Grant Sr and Stan Grant\" width=\"376\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Stan Grant Sr with his son, Guardian Australia\u2019s Indigenous affairs editor, Stan Grant.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: courtesy of the Grant family</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Every school holidays, Grant would forsake playing footy with his mates to \u201cgo bush\u201d with his father and grandfather.

The terror attack on 9/11, which Sampson refers to as the biggest homicide in US history, was a difficult time for all of the staff at the office. They worked round the clock to identify bodies, and the images they saw still haunt most of them fifteen years later.</p> <p>Identification often had to be done from DNA analysis of fragments of remains and is still ongoing as new DNA techniques are discovered.</p> <p>One particular case sticks out for Sampson: a Belgian man who died during the collapse of the World Trade Center towers. His parents were elderly, and while they knew that he had died, without official scientific confirmation, they could not get closure. His remains had not been identified. They were afraid they would pass away never having his death confirmed.</p> <p>Two years ago, Sampson\u2019s office was able to identify the Belgian man\u2019s remains through DNA analysis. \u201cI had the honor of telling them we had found their son.

It was granted a similar clearance by the European commission in February this year.</p> <p>Both Dell and EMC have a significant presence in Ireland. Dell remained circumspect yesterday in its statement on the commission\u2019s decision. </p> <p>\u201cWhile we are not going to comment on Apple\u2019s situation, I can confirm that Dell has a strong history of paying corporate and other taxes in Ireland and collecting taxes such as employment tax and VAT,\u201d said the company in its statement. \u201cWe understand our responsibility to be compliant with the tax laws of all of the countries in which we operate.

But that doesn\u2019t give Google the right to deny other companies the chance to compete and innovate,\u201d she said in the statement. </p> <p>\u201cToday, we have further strengthened our case that Google has unduly favoured its own comparison shopping service in its general search result pages. It means consumers may not see the most relevant results to their search queries.

  "<p>A broad coalition of civil rights and civil liberty organizations came out in opposition to \u201cpredictive policing\u201d technologies on Wednesday, calling the strategy \u201cprofoundly flawed\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThe data driving predictive enforcement activities \u2013 such as the location and timing of previously reported crimes, or patterns of community- and officer-initiated 911 calls \u2013 is profoundly limited and biased,\u201d the report summarized. The report also included input from the American Civil Liberties Union, Color of Change and the Brennan Center for Justice.</p> <p>Predictive policing has been increasingly used by departments throughout the US with roughly 20 of the largest 50 departments already using it to some degree, and another 11 considering its implementation. Predictive policing describes a set of computer-based forecasting tools that use crime data to inform where future incidents are likely to happen, and where officers should attempt to proactively patrol.</p> <p>The forerunner to predictive policing, \u201cCompStat\u201d-style crime mapping, has been commonplace in law enforcement for more than 20 years, and has long been subject to similar criticisms. Pioneered in New York City, CompStat tried to identify spikes in crime in real time and used \u201ctargeted enforcement\u201d via an increased police presence to mitigate it. Modern predictive policing, which attaches complex computer algorithms to this concept, emerged in the early 2010s. </p> <p>The major concern raised by the coalition is the low reliability of crime data. \u201cIt is well known that crime data is notoriously suspect, incomplete, easily manipulated and plagued by racial bias,\u201d said Ezekiel Edwards, director of the Criminal Law Reform Project at the ACLU. \u201cData on where crime occurs is dependent in part on when and where crime is reported and in part on where the police deploy to find crime.\u201d</p> <p>Malkia Cyril, co-founder and executive director of the Center for Media Justice, said: \u201cBiases are built into the enforcement strategies that generated the data in the first place.\u201d</p> <p>Other predictive policing strategies attempt to calculate the relative risks certain people in the community present and deploy officers to intervene directly with them. A version of this technology employed by the Chicago police department recently came under fire after <a href=\"http://www.chicagomag.com/city-life/August-2016/Chicago-Police-Data/\">a Rand report concluded</a> that individuals on the city\u2019s \u201cheat list\u201d were \u201cnot more or less likely to become a victim of a homicide or shooting than the [control] group\u201d.</p> <p>Virtually all predictive policing tools are proprietary software sold to departments by private law enforcement vendors and marketed as a way to make the job of policing easier and communities safer. For example, Predpol, one of the leading retailers of this kind of software claims its products \u201cdramatically reduce crime in jurisdictions of all types and sizes\u201d, citing outcomes from police departments such as the Los Angeles and Atlanta. </p> <p>In Redding, Pennsylvania, after adopting PredPol, the city credited the program for a 23% reduction in burglaries. Police chief William Heim said the presence of officers in PredPol flagged zones in the city \u201creally helps deter crime\u201d, calling the technology \u201ca real force-multiplier in crime prevention\u201d.</p> <p>The industry is worth less than $25m annually currently, but could be poised for rapid growth similar to how the increased adoption of body cameras over the last two years has rapidly expanded that industry. That technology, virtually nonexistent 10 years ago, is expected to exceed $1bn in annual sales for law enforcement vendors in the next year or two.</p> <p>The joint announcement comes on the heels of <a href=\"https://www.teamupturn.com/reports/2016/stuck-in-a-pattern\">a report by Upturn</a>, a law and technology consulting group, which examined the trend of predictive policing and its implications. The report stated that the \u201cconscientious application of data\u201d could help improve policing nationwide, but added that \u201cwe found little evidence that today\u2019s systems live up to their claims, and significant reason to fear that they may reinforce disproportionate and discriminatory policing practices.\u201d</p> <p>According to Upturn, \u201cRather than changing their tactics, police who use predictive tools have tended to focus on generating more citations and arrests.\u201d Predpol argues its tools have the opposite effect. \u201cWe have seen a decrease in arrests during the pilot testing that we have done,\u201d the company claims.</p> <p>The coalition went on to reject the idea that corporations such as Predpol should even be involved in the way policing decisions get made. </p> <p>\u201cSending corporate power and corporate interest into the criminal justice system will end in bad results,\u201d said Rashad Robinson, executive director of Color of Change. \u201cIt will end in profits over people and profits over safety and justice and none of us can afford that.\u201d </p>",
  "<p>Theresa May freewheeled through the opening weeks of her premiership. She was fortunate to enjoy a combination of a summer recess, post-referendum political fatigue and feelgood Olympic distraction. Decent economic numbers, Labour divisions and the Tory party rallying behind her have helped too. With her own generally sure-footed approach, these have all ensured that she has enjoyed, if not a honeymoon, then certainly a relatively easy start. <a href=\"https://www.icmunlimited.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/2016_guardian_august2_poll.pdf\">A new Guardian-ICM poll</a> showing the Conservatives with a comfortable 41%-27% lead over Labour means Tories will feel they have made the right choice and are on track.</p> <p>Today\u2019s cabinet meeting at Chequers marked the restart of traditional politics after the break. It began with a choreographed reminder that this government has so far offered Potemkin village politics. With her ministers around the table, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/aug/31/no-staying-in-eu-by-back-door-theresa-may-brexit\">Mrs May made a version of her stock summer speech</a> about Brexit meaning Brexit, no second referendum being possible and the importance of this being a country that works for everyone. Ministers made approving noises to show their loyalty and agreement. But it was all for the cameras and all largely meaningless.</p> <p>The reason for that, as the results of the day\u2019s discussion proved, is Brexit. Brexit means big unavoidable bad choices between rival interests. In the end it means, above everything else, having to declare priorities. Today it became clear that the government has begun to harden on its priorities. Until now, the language about soft Brexit and hard Brexit had concealed that, almost as much the circularity of Brexit meaning Brexit. Yet the statement after the cabinet makes clear that there is now a direction of political travel.</p> <p>The cabinet view today was that it wants <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/aug/31/corbyn-labour-leadership-yougov-poll-leadership-with-increased-majority-poll-suggests-politics-live\">to prioritise tighter rules on migration</a>, which is what two-thirds of leave voters think is the big need, rather than to maximise the UK\u2019s access to the European single market, as business, the City and, in particular, the Treasury prefer. This isn\u2019t the end of that argument. In many ways it is only the beginning. Many in the government will still look for the best of both worlds. But that is not on offer. Nothing will matter more in the lifetime of the May government than where it ends up taking its stand on the spectrum between the two poles of migration control and access to the single market. At this early stage, though, Mrs May\u2019s preference is clear.</p> <p>There can, of course, be attempts to strike various kinds of compromise: more access to Europe traded for rather fewer restrictions on migration. Politically, however, this risks being the worst of both worlds, not the best. Limited access to the single market may help richer sectors like financial services and higher education, which wanted to remain in the EU, while further angering the poorer ones whose workforces voted to leave.</p> <p>The brute fact facing ministers is that, if Brexit means <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/aug/31/after-article-50-the-eu-trade-and-movement-deals-the-uk-could-seek\">a European Economic Area deal</a> (a so-called soft Brexit), it will be seen as a betrayal of working-class leave voters in favour of those in a City that wanted to remain. But if Brexit means instead a migration clampdown and little access to the single market (hard Brexit) it will fuel business\u2019s demands for laxer regulation and lower business and personal tax regimes, creating <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/30/the-guardian-view-on-tax-and-ireland-apple-pay-your-way\">an Irish-style regime</a> outside the EU, with profoundly serious consequences for the poor as inequality widens and public spending is cut further.</p> <p>None of these choices is either desirable or likely to be popular in the long run. It is why the Brexit vote was so serious. It is why, in the end, voters will have to pass a democratic verdict on what the government decides this winter. Whether that takes the eventual form of a second referendum or a defining election is not the immediate point. The point is that if Britain is to have a serious chance of being a country that works for everyone, there will have to be a different strategy, as well as a plausible alternative government to make it happen.</p>",

With Chris Jordan, David Willey and Jake Ball all unused in the series to date, there is a chance for them and they will no doubt be straining at the leash to take on a Pakistan side who have failed to come down from the high of a drawn Test series.</p> <p>Batting changes look less likely with Alex Hales, the one player whose form had started to raise eyebrows in some quarters, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/30/england-pakistan-odi-world-record-match-report\" title=\"\">having overcome his recent funk</a>. Chris Woakes, who took four for 41 in Pakistan\u2019s reply at Trent Bridge, is among those delighted with the opener\u2019s turnaround. \u201cHe is a brilliant player who has scored at international level before,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve played against him and he has scored daddy hundreds in no time. He had a hundred before lunch once. You have to be able to play to do that. I suppose he hasn\u2019t scored as many runs as he would have liked this summer but to do that is special for him on his home ground. It was a really nice moment.\u201d</p> <p>Hales was not the only batsman to deliver on Tuesday, with Pakistan\u2019s bowlers also suffering from the frictionless strike-rotation of Joe Root, who scored 85 from 86 balls as he and Hales added 248 for the second wicket. Then Jos Buttler and Eoin Morgan ignited with the two fastest half-centuries by England batsmen, only 22 and 24 balls respectively.</p> <p>When a player such as Ben Stokes, scorer of the fastest Test double hundred by an Englishman, is left waiting in the pavilion, as he was the case in Nottingham, it is only natural to ponder just how far the current side can go. But whether a score of 500-plus is possible is not something Woakes, as a seamer, wants to contemplate too much.</p> <p>\u201cIf the boys keep batting the way they are, you can never say never,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it would be a really freakish day. We\u2019ve seen 400 reached a lot more often but whether 500 can happen, I\u2019m not sure it can, to be honest. I hope not as a bowler.\u201d</p> <p>Off the field, the issue of England\u2019s tour to Bangladesh rumbles on as players continue to digest the briefing from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/25/england-cricket-winter-tour-bangladesh-security-clearance\" title=\"\">the team\u2019s security expert</a>, Reg Dickason, last week. Woakes feels \u201cpeople won\u2019t know they are 100% safe until they get there\u201d but insisted the focus must continue to be on the opposition in front of them.</p> <p>In this respect, a quick turnaround for Thursday\u2019s game is handy, although whether it is good news for the tourists remains to be seen. They have thus far put on an accurate reenactment of England\u2019s plodding one-day cricket that led up to their World Cup exit early last year and now find their captain, Azhar, in the Alastair Cook role as the subject of reports in Pakistanthat he is set to be replaced.</p> <p>Azhar remains a fine Test batsman but in his 50-over guise has struggled to score at the rate the modern-day game dictates. The lamentable fielding display by his players was beyond his control and must improve if face, and the Super Series, is to be saved in the final two matches and the Twenty20 that follows.</p>",
  "<p>Plans by mobile phone operators to block adverts for customers across their networks are in doubt after the EU said they breached net neutrality legislation.</p> <p>Updated guidelines issued by the Body of European Regulators for Electronic Communications (Berec) this week state that advertising should not be blocked by networks, something that mobile operator Three has already trialled in the UK. </p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/net-neutrality\">Net neutrality</a> is the principle that internet service providers should treat all online content equally without blocking or slowing down specific websites on purpose, or allowing companies to pay for preferential treatment.</p> <p>The EU ruling could eliminate a looming threat to publishers who are already struggling with the commercial consequences of growing numbers of people using software to block ads on their PCs or smartphones. </p> <p>Berec\u2019s new guidelines say that providers \u201cshould not block, slow down, alter, restrict, interfere with, degrade or discriminate advertising \u2026 unless the conditions of the exceptions \u2026 are met in a specific case.\u201d</p> <p>It is the responsibility of UK regulator Ofcom to implement and interpret the guidelines.

One official said Kaepernick was as disliked among the league as Rae Carruth, the former Panthers player who was found guilty of conspiring to murder his pregnant girlfriend. Carruth is currently serving a 24-year prison sentence in North Carolina.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t want him anywhere near my team,\u201d one front office executive said of Kaepernick, according to Freeman. \u201cHe\u2019s a traitor.\u201d</p> <p>Freeman said each executive he spoke to wouldn\u2019t sign Kaepernick to play on their team. \u201cHe has no respect for our country,\u201d one said. \u201cFuck that guy.\u201d</p> <p>One general manager told Freeman: \u201cIn my career, I have never seen a guy so hated by front office guys as Kaepernick.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"http://bleacherreport.com/articles/2651681-mike-freemans-10-point-stance-kaepernick-anger-intense-in-nfl-front-offices\">Freeman wrote in his piece</a> that the disdain towards Kaepernick was hypocritical. \u201cPersonally, I think the dislike of Kaepernick is inappropriate and un-American,\u201d he wrote. \u201cI find it ironic that citizens who live in a country whose existence is based on dissent criticize someone who expresses dissent. But in NFL front offices, the feeling is very different.\u201d</p> <p>One owner told Freeman that he would rather resign than sign Kaepernick. Each executive said they thought Kaepernick would be released by the 49ers \u2013 and never play in the NFL again.</p> <p>Freeman pointed out that Kaepernick had not broken any rules, and that several players who had committed actual crimes were still playing in the NFL. \u201cWhen challenged that Kaepernick didn\u2019t break a law, or an NFL rule, and that it\u2019s his right to sit during the anthem, the response, consistently, was that it\u2019s also a team\u2019s right to not sign him. And to also dislike him,\u201d Freeman wrote.</p> <p>Kaepernick, 28, was taken by San Francisco in the second round of the 2011 draft. In 2012, he replaced the injured Alex Smith midway through the regular season, and led the 49ers to their first Super Bowl since 1994, where they lost to the Baltimore Ravens.</p> <p>He announced that he wouldn\u2019t be standing for the national anthem last week.</p> <p>\u201cI am not going to stand up to show pride in a flag for a country that oppresses black people and people of color,\u201d Kaepernick said. \u201cTo me, this is bigger than football and it would be selfish on my part to look the other way. There are bodies in the street and people getting paid leave and getting away with murder.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>I am outraged that Apple is outraged by&#xa0;its tax bill (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/30/apple-pay-back-taxes-eu-ruling-ireland-state-aid\" title=\"\">Apple rages at EU\u2019s \u20ac13bn tax demand</a>, 31 August). Apple has hundreds of stores in Europe to sell its products. The message to Apple is very simple: if any of your stores catch fire, don\u2019t bother to call the fire service. If&#xa0;you are burgled, don\u2019t call the police. If&#xa0;you want to deliver your products using public roads, you can\u2019t. If someone falls off a ladder in one of your stores, don\u2019t call the medical services.</p> <p>If you do not want to pay your taxes, fine. But do not expect to use the infrastructure paid for by our taxes.<br><strong>Neil Holmes</strong><br><em>Bromsgrove, Worcestershire</em></p> <p>\u2022 It is counterintuitive that Ireland should benefit from the \u20ac13bn tax, given that the Irish government knowingly set up the scheme to reduce the taxes paid to the rest of the EU. With the current solution, Ireland gets the historic benefits of employment and the&#xa0;unexpected future benefit of the tax. Sharing the \u20ac13bn across the countries where Apple products were sold and profits made would correct the wrong that is implied by the ruling.<br><strong>Paul Morrison</strong><br><em>London</em></p> <p>\u2022 The Irish government has been told to collect \u20ac13bn from Apple. But it is to appeal against the decision. Can someone please explain why?<br><strong>Ian Reissmann</strong><br><em>Henley-on-Thames, Oxfordshire</em></p> <p>\u2022 Even before the crash it was possible to see weaknesses in the Irish economy. Any economy that grows at the runaway rate that Ireland did for many years usually suffers a major damaging correction in due course. And when you have a freakishly high proportion of GDP being given to property speculation (higher even than the UK\u2019s), you have a recipe for disaster. In addition the OECD points out that Ireland\u2019s GDP (national output) is significantly greater than its GNP (national income) due to the repatriation of profits and royalties by multinational firms \u2013 to say nothing of the nameplate presences in Dublin, there merely for tax purposes and with a&#xa0;skeleton staff.</p> <p>Ireland may well have a skilled, hi-tech workforce, but this is no use if the country goes into boom and bust and you have paid for your workers\u2019 training only to lose them abroad. What&#xa0;a pity that the country didn\u2019t have some skilled economic advisers as&#xa0;well. They could have pointed out that copying the UK\u2019s model merely leads to&#xa0;disaster and a race to the bottom.</p> <p>Forget the Apple tax squabble for the moment. Ireland might be advised to take an economic health check and ask whether the Anglo-Saxon model is the way to go.<br><strong>David Redshaw</strong><br><em>Gravesend, Kent</em></p> <p>\u2022 Had Apple not offshored and arranged a sweetheart deal with Ireland to avoid US and EU taxes, thus amassing a huge cash pile, it would not be in this situation. And had the US tax authorities chased it aggressively, we would all be much better off. Apple is very greedy. It makes 40% gross profit from overpricing its products, exploiting their designer-label status, and all on the backs of underpaid Chinese workers. This is the true face of neoliberal global capitalism.<br><strong>Michael Miller</strong><br><em>Sheffield</em></p> <p>\u2022 The story of Apple\u2019s sweetheart Irish tax deals shows that something is deeply flawed in the way we currently do business. While we should not tar all multinationals with the same brush, we have undoubtedly seen a concentration of power and profit in fewer and fewer hands, allowing companies to set the rules and play the system.</p> <p>How the UK government acts now is crucial is establishing what kind of nation and economy we want to be. In&#xa0;the face of increasing pressure to turn the UK ever more into a tax haven, Theresa May needs to note that there are alternatives. The UK is home to about 70,000 social enterprises. They are growing faster than other businesses, reinvest profits to tackle social and environmental challenges, and contribute over \u00a324bn to the economy. They are keeping money in local communities and creating employment opportunities. There is even a social enterprise alternative to the iPhone, the Fairphone.</p> <p>For every bad Apple there is a social enterprise showing how business can act responsibly.<br><strong>Peter Holbrook</strong><br><em>Chief executive, Social Enterprise UK</em></p> <p>\u2022 Of course Apple is protesting about having to pay proper tax. It is in the nature of large corporations to do so. But thank goodness it looks as though the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/30/france-demands-end-to-ttip-trade-talks-matthias-fekl\" title=\"\">may be ditched</a>, with Germany, France and both US presidential candidates against it. If TTIP were in operation then Apple could take the EU&#xa0;to a court biased in favour of the corporation merely on the grounds that&#xa0;EU policy was reducing its profits.<br><strong>Michael McLoughlin</strong><br><em>Wallington, Surrey </em></p> <p><strong><em>\u2022 Join the debate \u2013 email </em></strong><a href=\"mailto:guardian.letters@theguardian.com\" title=\"\"><strong><em>guardian.letters@theguardian.com</em></strong></a></p>",

We\u2019ll look at how effective these are before considering whether an extra verification system is required.\u201d</p> <p>Previous reports that the BBC would begin snooping on Wi-Fi connections to check whether people are using iPlayer are understood to be wide of the mark. However, neither the BBC nor TV Licensing will reveal details of how they plan to detect lawbreakers.</p> <p>A TV Licensing spokesman said: \u201cWe know the vast majority of people are law-abiding and would anticipate those who need a licence for the first time will buy one. We have a range of enforcement techniques which we use and these have already allowed us to prosecute people who watch on a range of devices, not just TVs.\u201d</p> <p>Monitoring Wi-Fi connections en masse would be expensive and potentially illegal.

  "<p>Rafael Behr is absolutely right that the owners and providers of the global electronic infrastructure believe they can operate without either paying taxes or taking responsibility for the safety of their product (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/30/tech-giants-power-tax-apple-google\" title=\"\">Tech giants know where the power lies</a>, 31 August). The elements of that infrastructure, analogous to aircraft and airlines, leave gaping holes that allow access to hackers, virus-makers, pornographers and other criminals. Their \u201cairports\u201d \u2013 service providers \u2013 have no security scans for illegal material. All of them provide passage to&#xa0;the dark web. No wonder their profits are so enormous, for they take all the benefits of global markets without assuming any of the responsibility for basic safety and security standards. If they spent the resources they should to develop and provide secure systems, and to give users safe products the way other manufacturers have to, they might at the same time prevent some of the vicious invective that does so much harm to private individuals on social media.<br><strong>Anna Hodgetts</strong><br><em>Burgess Hill, West Sussex</em></p> <p>\u2022 Rafael Behr is wrong to claim that giant technological corporations possess power that goes beyond the control of elected governments. What they do have is the power to defy weak government \u2013 a situation common in Europe, where the prevailing neoliberal doctrine states that the best societies have small and weak governments. It was the member governments of the EU that created the legislation that enabled the technological giants to avoid taxes. Only recently George Osborne with his patent box legislation gave additional opportunities for these companies to avoid tax. This contrasts to the situation in China, where all of these companies have had to kow-tow to the strong government if they wish to engage in trade. Google struck a self-censorship deal with Beijing so it could continue operating. Where there is the political will these companies can be brought to heel.</p> <p>In the case Behr cites as an example of the power of Apple, where it &#xa0;refused to accede to the request of the &#xa0;FBI to unlock the operating system of a terrorist\u2019s phone, the FBI was able to employ hackers to break into the phone. The outcome may have been very different if the FBI had failed to break into that phone. It is quite possible that Washington would have introduced a law compelling Apple to give the FBI access to its operating system.</p> <p>These companies don\u2019t seem to realise that what governments give they can take away.

  "<p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/30/key-isis-leader-killed-in-syria-jihadi-group-says\">death of Islamic State\u2019s chief propagandist</a>, Abu Muhammad al-Adnani, has removed the group\u2019s most valuable figure in its war against the west, but his demise does not mean an end to the carnage.</p> <p>Over the past two years, Adnani has set in motion a phase of the terror group\u2019s growth that will continue to give it lead billing among the threats to Europe and the US. The people he empowered and the structures he put in place mean the menace of Isis will continue without him.</p> <p>Since 2014, Adnani had been the voice who galvanised so-called lone wolves to launch attacks. He had also overseen the deployment of some of the group\u2019s most lethally trained operatives, many of whom have been sent to Europe to wait for instructions to launch more co-ordinated missions, like <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/apr/20/brussels-bombings-osama-krayem-suspect-charged-role-paris-attacks\">those that struck Paris and Brussels</a>.</p> <p>Global savagery had become Adnani\u2019s calling card. Operating with more autonomy than most other leaders, he had ensured the group could still make its mark even as the territory <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/11/islamic-state-has-lost-grip-on-12-of-territory-in-six-months-study\">it held shrank rapidly</a>.</p> <p>The foreign operations file was given to him by the Isis leader, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jul/06/mosul-video-purports-abu-bakr-al-baghdadi-islamic-state\">Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi</a>, in as early as 2014. By then he was already the group\u2019s leader in Syria, one of two centres of gravity for Isis, the other being Mosul in Iraq.</p> <p>The heady early months of Isis\u2019s rise kept Adnani focused on consolidating gains in Syria until mid-2015, by which time land it held in both countries was being steadily stripped from its control. Population groups had started to flee en masse, many leaving for Europe on the migrant route, and out of chaos, Isis, led by Adnani and Baghdadi, sensed opportunity.</p> <p>Adnani, as well as another senior Iraqi member of the group, was responsible for smuggling militants disguised as refugees to Europe. Intelligence services in the UK, France, Germany and elsewhere believe the number of operatives to be at least 200. The fraught job of tracking the whereabouts of militants who left their home countries for Iraq and Syria has left European spies fearing the actual number may be substantially higher.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1f7c8375cf7b6dbaca08c7b43db675cf755cb948\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1f7c8375cf7b6dbaca08c7b43db675cf755cb948/48_408_2918_1750/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Iraqi fighter during clashes with Isis\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">An Iraqi Shia fighter fires artillery during clashes with Isis State militants near Falluja, Iraq.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Since late last year, Adnani had spent much of his time plotting attacks abroad. He is believed to have had direct links to the Paris cell and is also thought to have had a hand in Brussels and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jun/29/istanbul-ataturk-airport-attack-turkey-declares-day-of-mourning\">the strike on Istanbul\u2019s Atat\u00fcrk airport</a> in June.</p> <p>By then the group had lost an estimated 35,000-50,000 of its fighters, many of them jihadis who had travelled to join them. A stock take of the group\u2019s fortunes makes for grim reading for those who remain.</p> <p>More than 10 senior members of its two organising bodies, the shura and military councils, have been killed by airstrikes in the past 18 months. The toll on more junior members \u2013 mid-ranking commissioned officers in military terms \u2013 has been substantially higher.</p> <p>What to make of morale within the group is exercising military and intelligence chiefs ahead of what they believe will be a defining push against Mosul mooted for early next year. With Iraq\u2019s national army making surprising ground from the south and the Kurds holding positions to the north, and victories in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jun/26/falluja-iraq-fully-liberated-from-isis\">three other Iraqi cities</a> already up their sleeve, Mosul appears to be a less formidable target than it was a year ago.<br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/ng-interactive/2016/jan/08/us-led-airstrikes-against-islamic-state-syria-iraq-interactive-isis\">US-led airstrikes against Islamic State in Syria and Iraq \u2013 interactive</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Isis\u2019s days as a standalone military force appear numbered. However, the group\u2019s ideological appeal is harder to defeat in a region that continues to offer little political buy-in for disenfranchised Sunni Muslims. A large part of Isis\u2019s appeal, even among communities that do not share its implacable take on Islam, is that it offers support in the absence of any other organised system.</p> <p>Adnani was one of the last last leftovers of the original alumni that had adopted a de facto role as protector of the region\u2019s Sunni Muslims. He was among the few surviving leaders with personal links to the group\u2019s founder, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2006/jun/09/guardianobituaries.alqaida\">Abu Musab al-Zarqawi</a>, who moulded the most ruthless group of modern times from the resentment that steamed from the ousting of Saddam Hussein.</p> <p>Military men who had lost all when the Iraqi dictator fell were central to all subsequent incarnations of Isis. They blended their own strategic calculations with the zealotry of the Zarqawi\u2019ists, laying the ground for Isis\u2019s success and in doing so creating the most capable enemy that the west has seen for decades.</p> <p>Adnani had championed an expansion of Isis at any cost. His legacy will be written far from the northern Syrian town of al-Bab where a suspected US airstrike finally caught up with him.</p>",
  "<p>Most scientific experts agree that data from the initial trial badger culling areas in Gloucestershire, Somerset and Dorset do not justify further extension of culling (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/aug/30/badger-cull-areas-more-than-triple-under-new-government-licences\" title=\"\">Scientists criticise badger cull extension</a>, 31 August). In ignoring this advice, and extending culling to five new areas, the government risks not only wasting much money but also giving farmers false hope that the approach will contribute to reducing TB in cattle. The initial trial areas were set up to test whether free-range shooting could be done humanely and at the same time reduce badger populations by at least 70% \u2013 the figure previously established as the level needed to achieve a significant reduction in TB in cattle.</p> <p>The government was able to announce last year that it had achieved its culling targets, but only because they were based on unrealistically low badger population estimates \u2013 not on the central or best estimate value, but on the lowest bound value of the statistical margin of error around this estimate. This was simply a fudge. In none of these exercises did it achieve a 70% reduction based on the most likely population estimate.</p> <p>As Professor Woodroffe, one of the scientists involved in the original 10-year badger culling trials, <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-34089606\" title=\"\">put it</a>: \u201cSetting the targets in this way gives a small possibility of reducing badger numbers by 70%, but a much smaller reduction is much more likely.\u201d</p> <p>Non-achievement of culling targets not only risks the whole exercise being futile but might actually increase the infection rate in cattle due to the wider ranging of surviving badgers within the culling areas.</p> <p>Bovine TB has been declining since the introduction of stricter pre-movement testing of cattle in 2007-08, so it is difficult to tell what effect the culling is having on disease incidence within and around the culling areas. Nevertheless, contrary to anecdotal evidence from farmers, the only detailed analysis published so far showed no significant effect over the first two years.</p> <p>An honest government would admit that the culling methodology doesn\u2019t work and abandon it altogether. Failing this, an alternative would be to complete the initially planned four years of culling in the existing areas, basing targets on the most realistic population estimates, and then to follow up with a detailed analysis of the results before deciding whether to extend or discontinue culling.<br><strong>Dr Francis Kirkham</strong><br><em>Crediton, Devon</em></p> <p>\u2022 The pointless ineffective badger cull is not only being extended but is no longer to be independently monitored. Is this because previous monitoring found the cull was inhumane and not effective? As the slaughtered badgers are not tested for TB, how can any conclusions be drawn? The farming lobby and its leaders, such as the NFU, are not and never have been interested in scientific findings and instead come out with such ridiculous statements as \u201cwe can\u2019t be seen to be doing nothing\u201d though what they are doing appears to be compounding and worsening the problem.</p> <p>Who are these \u201clicensed shooters\u201d who will be wandering around our countryside at night, and furthermore who actually licenses them? We need to know a lot more about what is actually going on. Why no mention of a cattle vaccine that could be in place quickly and would put an end to all this cruelty and inefficiency which is at the taxpayer\u2019s expense, or is that again a solution that is too scientific?

It\u2019s still disappointing to take cash out of a machine that has \u201cfree withdrawals\u201d emblazoned over the top, to find that they\u2019re not. It is cheering to be notified every time I spend online that I have in fact \u201csaved\u201d some other amount. Or, on eBay, actually \u201cwon\u201d.</p> <p>All of us, whatever our social class, have our own bling. From superyachts to the little place in France, to the extraordinary nails. The less you can change about your life, the more the small rewards matter. In poor areas, the bookies move in, and so do the \u201csalons\u201d. Nails, spray tans and lash extensions are treats \u2013 mini-breaks from reality. Someone else waits on you. Everyone else can see what you have spent.</p> <p>Likewise, the important consumer product is the phone, a status symbol when you may not have a car or a home of your own. The familiar whine \u2013 that people are not actually poor because they possess a smartphone \u2013 is put into perspective by how near the edge many are. People are poor when they have no savings, nothing to fall back on. This has to be spelt out. Both government and opposition rhetoric confuses a conversation about debt and saving by limiting debate to a series of false binaries: austerity/anti-austerity, good debt/bad debt, spending/cutting. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jul/13/philip-hammond-appointed-chancellor-as-george-osborne-exits\">May fired Osborne</a>, fiscal stimulus is being applied: there has to be another way of talking now that is more than being \u201cagainst the cuts\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2016/mar/12/8m-uk-adults-problem-debt-money-advice-service\">More than 8m UK adults have \u2018problem debt\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In reality, saving may be as boring as hell, but we are facing a looming crisis around pensions because many have not saved enough to live on. Or to pay for their own care. Immigrants are stepping in here to provide the care that the state will not. All that was done in the name of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/pfi\">private finance initiative</a>: a short-term saving that is actually a vast overspending. The debts that graduates pile up may not be justified in terms of earning, if this is what we deem education to be for. So what is going on when so many in a rich country cannot save money? Is it simply profligacy?</p> <p>There is a general agreement among those who can afford to do it that saving is a habit that all must learn.</p> <p>\u201cDo banks just make money?\u201d my child asked. \u201cWell, yes and no. I will get you an account.\u201d Children\u2019s accounts still pay a bit of interest, apparently. Maybe she will find out how it all works. The crisis in consumer confidence that the experts are talking of, though, is surely less serious than this crisis in saving. If one must save to have a secure future and that is beyond our means, the future looks poor.</p>",
  "<p>Donald Trump\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/31/donald-trump-mexico-president-nieto\">shock trip to Mexico</a> has the potential to shake up the US presidential election as the Republican candidate continues in an attempt to \u201csoften\u201d what has been one of his most hardline and controversial policy areas \u2013 immigration.</p> <p>Scheduled to take place just hours before Trump will finally spell out a definitive immigration policy after 14 months on the campaign trail, it will mark the first time that Trump has met with a head of state since becoming the Republican nominee and only his second foreign trip as a candidate. The first was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jun/23/donald-trump-faces-wall-of-opposition-as-he-returns-to-scotland\">his trip to Scotland</a> in the aftermath of the Brexit referendum.<br></p> <p>The visit was announced in characteristic fashion by Trump, on Twitter. Just minutes before the Republican candidate was due to take the stage at a campaign rally in the safe Democratic state of Washington on Tuesday night, he tweeted: \u201cI have accepted the invitation of President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto, of Mexico, and look very much forward to meeting him tomorrow.\u201d</p> <p>The meeting marks a shift in tone for Pe\u00f1a Nieto, who compared Trump to Mussolini and Hitler <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/news/mexican-president-pena-nieto-compares-donald-trump-to-hitler-and-mussolini/\">in a March interview</a> with a Mexican newspaper. \u201cI believe in dialogue to promote the interests of Mexico in the world and to protect Mexicans wherever they are,\u201d he tweeted early on Wednesday morning.</p> <p>It comes as the Mexican president is facing <a href=\"http://www.nbcnews.com/news/latino/why-mexican-president-enrique-pe-nieto-so-unpopular-n640611\">historically low approval ratings</a> amid <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/22/mexico-president-enrique-pena-nieto-plagiarized-thesis-law-degree\">a plagiarism controversy</a> and an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/18/mexico-president-apologizes-luxury-home-contractor\">ongoing corruption scandal</a> over a house purchased by his wife from a government contractor. </p> <p>Trump touched down in Mexico City shortly after 1pm local time and is scheduled to meet with Pena Nieto for roughly 90 minutes at Los Pinos, the presidential residence. Afterwards both the Mexican president and the Republican nominee are expected to give statements to the press. It is unclear if either will take questions although Kellyanne Conway, Trump\u2019s campaign manager, insisted Wednesday that \u201cthere\u2019s going to be a press availability\u201d in an interview with Fox News.</p> <p>Trump\u2019s visit <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/31/donald-trump-mexico-visit-greeted-with-hostility-online\">has not been well received south of the border</a>. \u201c@realDonaldTrump you are not welcome in Mexico,\u201d tweeted <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MBarbosaMX/status/770822727510822912\">Miguel Barbosa</a>, of the opposition Party of the Democratic Revolution. \u201cGet out!

The pledge is a staple of his campaign rallies, at which he frequently asks the crowd: \u201cWho is going to pay for the wall?\u201d The response is loudly shouted: \u201cMexico.\u201d<br></p> <p>Within minutes of announcing his presidential campaign in June 2015, Trump claimed that the Mexican government was deliberately sending criminals and rapists across the border to the United States. The Republican nominee has <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/487316463204986880\">tweeted</a> that Mexico is an \u201cenemy\u201d of the United States and that the country is <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/570384640281870337?lang=en\">\u201ccorrupt.\u201d</a> Despite all this, he has long maintained: \u201cI love the Mexican people.\u201d</p> <p>The trip is only Trump\u2019s second visit abroad as a candidate. Although presidential candidates often travel overseas to boost their foreign policy credentials, Trump has kept almost entirely to the United States. The only exception was his June trip to Scotland for the opening of his golf course there. Then, Trump held <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jun/24/donald-trump-hails-eu-referendum-result-as-he-arrives-in-uk\">a self-congratulatory press conference</a> only hours after the UK had voted to leave the EU, at which the Republican nominee praised himself for correctly predicting the result. </p> <p>Unlike his trip to Scotland, Trump\u2019s visit to Mexico is intended to promote his campaign, not his personal business interests. It underscores the messaging in Trump\u2019s immigration speech scheduled for Wednesday night in Phoenix, Arizona. There, the Republican nominee is expected to try to strike a balance between the hardline rhetoric he used throughout the Republican primary and the need to deflect charges of racism in order to win a general election in November. </p> <p>The Republican nominee has struggled in the past two weeks to clarify his position on immigration, specifically whether he is undergoing \u201ca softening\u201d on his past call for the deportation of all 11 million illegal immigrants in the United States. Trump, who previously backed \u201ca deportation force,\u201d seemingly endorsed a path to legal status for undocumented immigrations and then reversed himself in the past week. The resulting lack of clarity forced prominent rightwing talkshow host Rush Limbaugh <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2016/aug/30/donald-trump-hillary-clinton-hacking-threat-election-live?page=with:block-57c5aa4be4b0df5f040dbd69#block-57c5aa4be4b0df5f040dbd69\">to admit to</a> his audience on Monday: \u201cI never took him seriously\u201d on immigration.</p> <p>In a statement, Tana Goertz, a former contestant on Trump\u2019s television show The Apprentice and senior advisor to his campaign, insisted that Trump would stay tough on immigration in his speech on Wednesday. </p> <p>\u201cThroughout his presidential campaign, Donald J Trump has been consistent in his calls to end illegal immigration by building a wall on our southern border. He is the only candidate in this race who will stop illegal immigration, secure our border, end sanctuary cities, enforce our existing laws and stop American employers from hiring illegal workers,\u201d she said. \u201cThese reforms will not only put an end to our illegal immigration epidemic \u2014 they will promote safe communities and good-paying jobs that will make America great again.\u201d</p> <p>The move on immigration follows rhetorical attempts to reach out to African American voters following a shakeup of his campaign team and the hiring of pollster Kellyanne Conway as his campaign manager and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/17/donald-trump-stephen-bannon-breitbart-news-kellyanne-conway\">Steve Bannon, former executive chairman of rightwing website Breitbart</a>, as his campaign CEO. </p> <p>Trump is not the only presidential candidate who has received an invitation from Pe\u00f1a Nieto. In a statement from senior campaign official, the Clinton campaign told the Guardian: \u201cWe have received a letter from President Pe\u00f1a Nieto requesting an opportunity to meet. Secretary Clinton last met with President Pe\u00f1a Nieto in Mexico in 2014 and our campaign is in a regular dialogue with the Mexican government officials. She looks forward to talking with President Pe\u00f1a Nieto again at the appropriate time.\u201d</p> <p>Trump reportedly went to Mexico accompanied by two close advisers, former New York mayor Rudy Giuliani and Senator Jeff Sessions from Alabama. However, the Republican nominee was not accompanied by his traveling press corps, who have been stranded in the United States in an unprecedented step. The Trump campaign has been historically combative towards the press and refused to credential a number of outlets for his events, including <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jun/25/donald-trump-media-ban-guardian-denied-entry-campaign-event\">the Guardian in one instance</a>, on his trip to Scotland. </p> <p><em>Additional reporting by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/samjones\">Sam Jones</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/david-agren\">David Agren</a> in Villahermosa, Mexico</em></p>",

The key thing to know about ADP\u2019s model is that is predominantly a function of last month\u2019s official employment data, which means that ADP\u2019s own up-to-date payrolls data plays only a minor role in generating the estimate. This means that the directional accuracy of ADP as a lead indicator of non-farm payrolls (ie higher or lower growth than last month) is around 50%. We are therefore none-the-wiser ahead of Friday\u2019s number, even if at face value, it supports the consensus call of 180,000.</p> <p>We expect job creation to fall short of expectations (ING forecast 150,000), following two months of remarkably strong non-farm payrolls. But... the FOMC would probably be content with such a figure, even if markets may view it as slightly disappointing. As the pool of available labour evaporates, job creation need only keep pace with increases in the overall size of the labour force. Some FOMC speakers have said that they would be comfortable with sub-150,000 non-farm payroll numbers, most notably Vice Chair Fischer who has indicated that 75-150 thousand would be acceptable.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57c6dff8e4b0df5f040dbfd8\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-08-31T13:52:37.971Z\">2.52pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Wall Street opens lower</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>US markets are down in early trading:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Dow Jones: -0.1% at 18,431</strong></li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>S&amp;P 500: -0.2% at 2,172</strong></li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>Nasdaq: -0.3% at 4,763</strong></li> </ul> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57c6d9f6e4b04fe839bc522f\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-08-31T13:39:43.830Z\">2.39pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Ryanair's O'Leary: Ireland should tell EU to f**k off over Apple</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"e77b46ea0378b96a194bb6fbe90b32e87e54719b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e77b46ea0378b96a194bb6fbe90b32e87e54719b/0_136_4096_2458/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Michael O\u2019Leary\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Michael O\u2019Leary</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Hannah Mckay/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>The Guardian\u2019s Rob Davies has been at a Ryanair press conference, where he found chief executive Michael O\u2019Leary in typically talkative form.</strong></p> <p>O\u2019Leary was announcing the budget airline\u2019s new routes to Strasbourg and Faro, but commented on a number of subjects...</p> <p><strong>1.

rise in inflation is unlikely to put a stop to talk of more stimulus.

We're not buying it | Barrett Holmes Pitner</a> </p> </aside>  <p>White supremacist groups rose in the civil war\u2019s aftermath, organized by southern white people determined to use violence to deny Reconstruction-era promotion of black citizenship. The Ku Klux Klan is the most famous of these groups, whose numbers steadily increased at the end of the 19th century. By the early 20th century the Klan\u2019s worldview helped shape the racial nativism \u2013 marked by anti-immigrant fervor, antisemitism and anti-Catholicism \u2013 that gripped the nation.</p> <p>The Klan practically joined the American mainstream during the 1920s, proudly marching by the tens of thousands in the nation\u2019s capital, their very presence giving weight to the pseudo-science of eugenics being popularized at the time.</p> <p>Fewer white hate groups dotted America\u2019s political landscape after the second world war, the result of both the success of racial segregation and the pushback from anti-racist groups during WWII\u2019s freedom surge. The 1954 Brown v Board of Ed supreme court desegregation decision resurrected these groups with a vengeance, one of the most notable being the White Citizens Councils opposing public school integration that gained traction throughout the south.</p> <p>By the late 1960s, the political energies of hate groups reached their apex in the candidacy of former Alabama governor George Wallace, who received nearly 10m popular votes as a segregationist candidate for president in 1968. And the Republican party\u2019s now infamous \u201csouthern strategy\u201d further cultivated disgruntled white voters, sometimes called \u201cDixiecrats\u201d, with naked appeals to racism.</p> <p>Donald Trump, the inheritor of this complex history, is playing a most dangerous game. His calls to \u201cmake America great again\u201d \u2013 which many view as thinly veiled code for white nationalism \u2013 has inspired millions of disgruntled and economically insecure white people, unleashing barely controlled furies that have roiled and embarrassed the nation. <br></p> <p>White Lives Matter proponents gained national attention when they <a href=\"http://www.chron.com/houston/article/White-Lives-Matter-group-protests-outside-NAACP-9176142.php\">staged a protest</a> outside of NAACP offices in Houston that prominently featured the Confederate flag. An outgrowth of a social media meme that spread among white people in the aftermath of Black Lives Matter protests, the group traffics in the fiction that white Americans are under assault from an onslaught of illegal immigration, reverse racism and political correctness. </p> <p>With ties to the white nationalist Aryan Front Coalition and a self-described mission to preserve the white race, White Lives Matter joins the Southern Poverty law Center\u2019s list of 892 active hate groups in the US. America\u2019s racial Pandora\u2019s box, once thought to have been closed by Obama\u2019s watershed presidential election, has been reopened with a vengeance.</p> <p>As our third consecutive summer of racial discontent comes to an end, white and black Americans remain <a href=\"http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/06/27/key-takeaways-race-and-inequality/\">split</a> over what might be called our collective racial reality. Blacks are more likely than whites to perceive racial discrimination, advocate for substantive policy changes, document unfair treatment by the criminal justice system and other institutions and to support Black Lives Matter.</p> <p>Yet these differences merely scratch the surface of the pernicious effect of groups such as White Lives Matter. Buoyed by Trump\u2019s campaign and the capitulation of mainstream Republicans, groups like White Lives Matter have helped anti-black racism to once again be normalized. And its activists form the latest beachhead in the racial archipelago that contours a nation that twice voted overwhelmingly to elect a black president.</p> <p>The devastating takeaway from allegations of reverse racism, the promotion of the Confederate flag and the demonization of Black Lives Matter is the surreal picture by many aggrieved whites that they are the most discriminated-against group in America. </p> <p>Even as social economic indicators reveal the exact opposite, the racial grievances and resentment emanating from such hate groups have successfully captured the imagination of a sizeable portion of the American electorate. White Lives Matter\u2019s designation as a hate group confirms what we already knew about not just one organization, but the iconic demagogue who has breathed life into racial furies that we recently thought were facing extinction. </p>",

It\u2019s reported that neither the US embassy in Mexico nor the Mexican government were given advance warning about the visit. And though Pe\u00f1a Nieto did extend invitations to both Hillary Clinton and Trump to meet with him in Mexico City, it\u2019s easy to see that both Pe\u00f1a Nieto and Trump have something to gain from this particularly timely visit.</p> <p>Trump stands to bolster his ever-loosening grip on his campaign\u2019s trademark issue, immigration, ahead of his big speech in Arizona on Wednesday.

The president thinks that he will see the bad man, appear stern to the bad man, tell everyone that he was indeed stern to the bad man and then his poll numbers will rise. Easy.

And even if Pe\u00f1a Nieto does a good job in standing tall to Trump\u2019s xenophobic, anti-Nafta, pro-wall rhetoric, the president risks everything should the Republican candidate choose to exploit his numerous political weaknesses. That would not just be damaging to him, but to Mexico\u2019s international reputation at large. </p> <p>That\u2019s why many fear this gamble can only go well for Trump. And if this meeting teaches us anything it\u2019s that Pe\u00f1a Nieto is willing to risk Mexican ire and possible geopolitical consequences if only to save his own political career. </p>",

  "<p>A teenager is in a critical condition after he was shot in the head on his doorstep following a row in north London.</p> <p>The 18-year-old was shot just before 3.30pm on Tuesday on Denmark Road, near Turnpike Lane in Haringey. Paramedics and an air ambulance crew treated him at the scene before he was taken to a central London hospital.</p> <p>A resident living near the scene, who did not want to be named, said she had called police after hearing shots and finding the youth, named locally as Jojo, lying injured in the street.</p> <p>\u201cIt was one of the boys who lives on the estate, 18, shot in the head,\u201d she said. \u201cHis friend was holding a shirt to his head and he took it away at one point and my friend said put that back.</p> <p>\u201cI know the boy so I was just kind of feeling for him, because he kept going in and out of consciousness \u2026 I can\u2019t get the look on his face out of my head, to be honest with you. It was just that kind of shock-horror petrified look in his eyes, so scared.\u201d</p> <p>The teenager was with his brother and a friend when he was shot, the neighbour said. Police and paramedics arrived within minutes and treated him at the scene before taking him away with his mother, in an ambulance, she added.</p> <p>There have been no arrests and the Metropolitan police is appealing for witnesses. The shooter has been described as a man of Mediterranean appearance, with olive skin, aged about 18. He was with another man, who was described as black and also about 18.</p> <p>The two men were thought to have came from the direction of Turnpike Lane tube station. Afterwards, it is thought they escaped on bicycles towards High Street.</p> <p>Detectives from the Trident and area crime command, which deals with gang-related crime and all non-fatal shootings, are investigating whether the incident was linked to an earlier one involving the victim and his brother.</p> <p>Police said that at about 1.30pm on Tuesday the brothers were driving along High Street, near the junction with New River Avenue, when one person in the car noticed a man he knew on a bike. The car stopped and the victim and his brother had a row with the man.</p> <p>DCI Dan Brown, who is leading the investigation for Trident, said: \u201cThe man involved in the altercation has been described as having olive skin. The row happened in the street, and I\u2019m sure will have been witnessed by a number of people.</p> <p>\u201cThis was a bold attack in broad daylight on the victim\u2019s doorstep and I want to hear from anyone that knows who the suspects are or who may have vital information for us.\u201d</p> <p>Paul Tuffery, 61, who lives down the road from the shooting, said he heard \u201ca couple of cracks\u201d and shouting at about 3.30pm.</p> <p>\u201cThere was shouting, it sounded like kids screaming but round here there\u2019s always kids screaming, and next minute helicopters came over, the air ambulance, and police closed off the road and they landed down the bottom,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cThey were there for quite some time because they were treating the one that got shot \u2013 he was on the ground.\u201d</p> <p>Several neighbours spoke of gangs of youths hanging around the area, smoking cannabis and apparently dealing drugs. Two years ago the area had been affected by another shooting.</p> <p>\u201cMost of the people who come to [hang around in] this area don\u2019t even live here,\u201d one neighbour, who preferred not to give her name, said. \u201cI\u2019ve called the police so many times about them. They smoke weed out there and I called the police so many times because the smoke goes up to my flat and I get lightheaded.\u201d</p> <p>A London ambulance service spokesperson said paramedics were called at 3.35pm. \u201cWe sent an ambulance crew, a single responder in a car, an incident response officer and a hazardous area response team to the scene alongside London\u2019s air ambulance,\u201d the spokesperson said.</p> <p>\u201cThe first of our medics arrived at the scene in under five minutes. We treated a man at the scene and took him as a priority to a hospital in central London.\u201d </p>",
  "<p>Hearing loss is normally associated with old age or years of touring in a <a href=\"https://www.audicus.com/musicians-and-hearing-loss/\">rock band</a>. But preventable noise-induced hearing loss is actually pretty common in the general population, affecting <a href=\"https://www.nidcd.nih.gov/health/noise-induced-hearing-loss\">around 15% of Americans</a> according to the National Institute of Deafness and Communication Disorders (NIDCD).</p> <p>When that damage is done to the sensory hair cells in the ear, people can\u2019t regenerate them, so the damage is permanent, explains John Oghalai, professor of otolaryngology at Stanford University and director of the Children\u2019s Hearing Center at Lucile Packard Children\u2019s Hospital Stanford. While there is ongoing research into finding ways to regenerate sensory hair cells and improve cochlear implants, there is no perfect solution to hearing loss right now, which makes the need to lessen our exposure to loud noise that much more important.</p> <p>But when you live in a city, like the <a href=\"https://ask.census.gov/faq.php?id=5000&amp;faqId=5971\">majority</a> of US residents, it can be hard to avoid loud noise, between trains, buses, honking cars and the sound of millions of people living on top of each other. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/jul/28/emotional-support-animal-service-pet-flying-housing\">An emotional support animal is just a mouse click away</a> </p> </aside>  <p>To get a sense of how much volume many of us experience just by going to work or meeting a friend for a meal, I decided to measure the normal din that 8.5 million New Yorkers experience every day.</p> <p>Since New Yorkers love to eat out \u2013 and the eateries in this city are notoriously loud \u2013 I measured the volume in two restaurants: a popular New Orleans style casual eatery in <a href=\"http://www.catfishnyc.com/\">Brooklyn</a> and a <a href=\"http://jacobspickles.com/\">trendy Southern food restaurant</a> in Manhattan during Sunday brunch. </p> <p>During dinner time, the Brooklyn restaurant clocked in at 91 decibels. At the Manhattan brunch spot, the noise level varied between 92 decibels as people strained to be heard above the reggae music, to a low of 72 decibels with UB40\u2019s 1980s hit Red Red Wine, which allowed everyone to shout a little less. </p> <p>For <a href=\"http://www.dot.ca.gov/dist2/projects/sixer/loud.pdf\">comparison</a>, a food blender registers at around 90 decibels. Imagine dining out as a blender is going off at the next table.</p> <p>According to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (<a href=\"https://www.osha.gov/Publications/laboratory/OSHAfactsheet-laboratory-safety-noise.pdf\">Osha</a>), exposure to 90 decibels risks damaging hearing after eight hours, so each time the waitstaff pull a long shift, they may be causing damage to their ears.</p> <p>What constitutes too loud is up for debate. The Osha permissible <a href=\"https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/noisehearingconservation/\">exposure limit is 90 decibels for all workers for an eight-hour day</a>. But there is no way to determine the exact volume at which most people would develop hearing loss without actually exposing people to hearing damaging levels of noise on purpose, which would be unethical. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health has found \u201csignificant noise-induced hearing loss\u201d at the levels permitted by Osha.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"4dcbbc7593802e7a130197fdf9df09998d8dbec2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4dcbbc7593802e7a130197fdf9df09998d8dbec2/0_98_2200_1320/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sometimes, dining out in Brooklyn can be hazardous to your long term hearing.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sometimes, dining out in Brooklyn can be hazardous to your long term hearing.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bloomberg/Bloomberg via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Even if New Yorkers can avoid loud restaurants, <a href=\"http://web.mta.info/nyct/facts/ffsubway.htm\">5.7 million people </a>travel by subway each weekday.

In Times Square, one of the busiest subway stations in the city, the noise level ranges from 80 decibels to 96 decibels when the express trains barrel through the station.</p> <p>Other stations measured, including the 86th street station on Manhattan\u2019s Upper West Side briefly hit an ear-splitting 101.9 decibels. </p> <p>The eastbound trains at Union Square, another popular station, registered in at around 95 decibels, as New Yorkers and tourists alike looked pained and covered their ears with their hands. For perspective, 100 decibels is also the <a href=\"https://www.chem.purdue.edu/chemsafety/Training/PPETrain/dblevels.htm\">volume</a> of a power lawn mower or a jet taking off at 305 meters.</p> <p>Most of us try to spend as little time in subway stations as possible, and MTA employees wear hearing protection, but anyone who commutes in the city easily spends 15-30 minutes, five days a week listening to industrial-level noise while waiting for their train to pull in.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/jun/15/health-aura-reading-gwyneth-paltrow-goop-photography\">What's in an aura?

The spokesperson said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The prime minister chaired political cabinet at Chequers this afternoon.</p> <p>The meeting began with a discussion led by Patrick McLoughlin. He spoke about the strength of the Conservative party, with membership growing by almost 50,000 over the summer. Looking ahead to conference he announced the largest attendance in over a decade and that the theme would be \u201cA country that works for everyone\u201d. The prime minister added this reflected the fact that we are a united party and a united government, getting on with the job of delivering on the issues that British people care about. This was contrasted with the inward looking and divided opposition.</p> <p>It was agreed that the opening day of conference would be about global Britain - showing that we are more outward looking than ever before. In a discussion about Brexit the PM said that there were two related imperatives: getting the best deal for people at home, and getting the right deal for Britain abroad.</p> <p>There was a strong emphasis on pushing ahead to article 50 to lead Britain successfully out of the European Union - with no need for a parliamentary vote.</p> <p>Furthermore, several cabinet members made it clear that we are leaving the EU but not leaving Europe, with a decisive view that the model we are seeking is one unique to the United Kingdom and not an off the shelf solution. This must mean controls on the numbers of people who come to Britain from Europe but also a positive outcome for those who wish to trade goods and services.</p> <p>On the agenda and discussed at length was the commitment to the devolved nations to make sure that Brexit works for all - but cabinet members were clear that it is the United Kingdom\u2019s government\u2019s decision to establish its terms and on when to trigger article 50.</p> </blockquote> <p>And here are the key points.</p> <ul> <li><strong>The cabinet has agreed that getting a Brexit deal that will allow the UK to control immigration will take precedence over getting a deal that gives full access to the single market.</strong> That is the implication of the statement that the deal \u201cmust mean controls on the numbers of people who come to Britain from Europe but also a positive outcome for those who wish to trade goods and services.\u201d The word \u201ccontrols\u201d is specific; the phrase \u201cpositive outcome\u201d is vague, and could mean very little.</li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>MPs will not get a vote on the decision to invoke article 50, triggering the formal two-year EU withdrawal process, the cabinet has confirmed.</strong></li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland will be consulted over Brexit, but will not get a veto, the cabinet has confirmed.</strong></li> </ul>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"01031b4f94d43a585fce05decca7af8c85eeb354\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/01031b4f94d43a585fce05decca7af8c85eeb354/0_63_5184_3110/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Theresa May addressing cabinet at Chequers.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Theresa May addressing cabinet at Chequers.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Stefan Rousseau/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-08-31T16:26:42.111Z\">at 5.26pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57c6f66de4b0f6cb85628ace\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-08-31T15:25:56.972Z\">4.25pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>I\u2019m told there was more said about Brexit at the political cabinet.

The cabinet reiterated the government\u2019s commitment to fiscal discipline and living within our means. Ministers agreed that we should be seizing the opportunity of Brexit to confirm the UK\u2019s place as one of the great trading nations in the world, fostering entrepreneurialism and setting out a long term vision for the country. They also agreed on the vital need to increase productivity and the importance of doing more to foster economic growth and industrial development in regions up and down the country.<br></p> <p>The foreign secretary then provided an update on the campaign to defeat Daesh in Syria, Iraq and Libya and the UK\u2019s role in supporting political progress in all three countries. The foreign secretary highlighted the progress that had been made in squeezing the territory held by Daesh, with 40% reclaimed, as well as a fall in support for Daesh\u2019s ideology around the world. The cabinet agreed that Islamist terrorism continues to be one of the greatest security threats we face and therefore we must continue to work closely with our allies to defeat Daesh and to support strong, stable governance in countries around the world, particularly in countries where terrorists are trying to establish safe havens.<br></p> <p>Conversations continued after lunch during a meeting of the political cabinet.</p> </blockquote> <p>This morning, in her opening remarks, Theresa May said cabinet would discuss \u201cthe next steps\u201d to be taken in relation to Brexit. (See<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/aug/31/corbyn-labour-leadership-yougov-poll-leadership-with-increased-majority-poll-suggests-politics-live?page=with:block-57c6acf5e4b0f6cb8562899d#block-57c6acf5e4b0f6cb8562899d\"> 11.26am.)</a> But this statement says very little about this, beyond saying the government wants Britain to remain \u201cone of the great trading nations in the world\u201d. At this stage (I have not had any further briefing yet) it is not clear whether that is because ministers did not agree anything meaningful on the next stage of Brexit, or whether they did but are just choosing to keep it all secret. May says \u201cBrexit means Brexit\u201d but that\u2019s just circular logic. As for what it really means, that remains as much of a mystery as ever.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-08-31T15:18:57.192Z\">at 4.18pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57c6ee01e4b04fe839bc5292\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-08-31T15:03:52.600Z\">4.03pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Corbyn proposes 'gender audit' of Labour policies</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>At an event at Unison HQ later this afternoon <strong>Jeremy Corbyn</strong> will be announcing proposals to benefit women. His team have just emailed out the details. </p> <p>His plans include having a regular \u201cgender audit\u201d of Labour policies, setting up a new women\u2019s advisory board to advise the leader and toughening the law (in a manner so far unspecified) on online harrassment.</p> <p>Here are the key announcements from the news release.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p> <strong>Increasing women\u2019s representation in our society, democracy and party</strong> by supporting all women shortlists to achieve 50:50 representation in parliament and the same aim for all public offices; supporting a policy-making annual Labour women\u2019s conference; publishing a regular \u2018gender audit\u2019 of Labour policies; and consult on establishing a high level, strategic women\u2019s advisory board linked to the leader\u2019s office to ensure women are at the heart of our policies, and to support the shadow secretary of state for women and equalities, along with advisory boards on other equality strands.</p> <p><strong>Investing in an economy that delivers for women. </strong>Austerity isn\u2019t working and has disproportionately harmed women. Our public investment strategy will provide a foundation for the economy to grow, and from which to properly fund and democratise our public services and end the cuts that women, as the majority of public service users and workforce, have borne the brunt of. Labour will ensure increased recruitment of women into science, technology, engineering and manufacturing occupations and will tackle occupational segregation in our economy. Labour will also give enhanced powers to the Equality and Human Rights Commission to penalise companies that do not publish detailed gender pay data at a company-wide level as part of tackling equal pay issues.</p> <p><strong>Tackling sexual harassment and threats online</strong> through a wide-ranging consultation exercise on how to strengthen the law and its implementation and increase organisations\u2019 responsibility towards promoting safe and respectful \u2018community standards\u2019 online. Within the party we will take forward the recommendations of the Shami Chakrabarti Inquiry to consult on and introduce a wider equal opportunities policy, training and guidance for members and staff, recognising that online abuse is often also racist and homophobic in nature as well as misogynistic.</p> </blockquote> <p>Some of these proposals (for example, on equal pay audits) are similar or identical to what Corbyn proposed in his <a href=\"https://d3n8a8pro7vhmx.cloudfront.net/jeremyforlabour/pages/87/attachments/original/1438076296/WorkingWithWomen.pdf?1438076296\">Working with Women policy paper (pdf)</a> in last year\u2019s leadership contest, but in some respects Corbyn is now going further. For example, last year he spoke of wanting to ensure 50% of Labour MPs were women. Now he is talking of aiming to get 50/50 male/female representation \u201cfor all public offices\u201d.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57c6e450e4b0f6cb85628a89\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-08-31T14:10:48.995Z\">3.10pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>On the World at One <strong>Jacob Rees-Mogg</strong>, the Conservative backbencher, explained why hardline Brexiteers like himself were opposed to Britain remaining in the single market.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I think the expectation or desire to remain in the single market is basically code for rejecting the referendum result.

We want to be a government and a country that works for everyone, and we\u2019ll be talking about some of the steps that we need to take in order to build that society that works for everyone. And I want it to be a society where it\u2019s the talent that you have and how hard you\u2019re prepared to work that determines how you get on, rather than your background.</p> <p>We\u2019ll be having an update on the state of the economy. We\u2019ll be looking at how we can work to increase productivity \u2013 that\u2019s one of the key issues that we want to address. But also how we can get tough on irresponsible behaviour in big business \u2013 again making sure that actually everyone is able to share in the country\u2019s prosperity.</p> <p>We will be looking at the legislative programme that we have coming up in parliament.

So there are challenges ahead but it\u2019s an important and significant moment for us and I think we have real opportunities to develop the United Kingdom and ensure that it does work for everyone in the UK.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57c69c2fe4b0f6cb85628973\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-08-31T10:04:14.395Z\">11.04am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">YouGov's Labour leadership poll - 10 findings from the small print</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>As promised, here is more from the detail of the YouGov poll. I posted the key findings at <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/aug/31/corbyn-labour-leadership-yougov-poll-leadership-with-increased-majority-poll-suggests-politics-live?page=with:block-57c685f6e4b0f6cb85628930#block-57c685f6e4b0f6cb85628930\">9.02am</a>. Here are 10 more findings from the survey.</p> <p><strong>1 - Corbyn\u2019s key strength is that he is seen as \u201cprincipled\u201d.</strong> Some 76% of the Labour selectorate said they saw him this way. He also scored well for honesty (64%) and for \u201cshares my political outlook\u201d 58%. But only 33% of the Labour selectorate as a whole said he was likely to lead the party to victory at the election, and only 35% said he was competent. This is from the New Statesman\u2019s<strong> Stephen Bush.</strong><br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/stephenkb/status/770741279336570880\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Hard to sustain from these numbers that Labour members are &quot;mad&quot; or in denial about Corbyn&#39;s failings. <a href=\"https://t.co/iVBpT8K48g\">pic.twitter.com/iVBpT8K48g</a></p>&mdash; Stephen Bush (@stephenkb) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/stephenkb/status/770741279336570880\">August 30, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>People planning to vote for Corbyn in the contest were more likely to rate his competence and electability, but even amongst this group only 56% said he was likely to lead the party to victory, and only 60% said he was competent.</p> <p><strong>2 - Smith\u2019s key strength is that he is seen as \u201ccompetent\u201d.</strong> But only 30% of the Labour selectorate said they saw him as competent - a remarkably low figure, given that he has put this trait at the centre of his leadership campaign. His biggest weakness is that he is seen as \u201cuntrustworthy\u201d - by 45% of those voting in the contest.</p> <p><strong>3 - Smith is seen as even less likely than Corbyn to lead Labour to victory at the general election by those voting in the contest.</strong> Only 12% of them said they thought Smith was likely to win the general election for the party. And even amongst those planning to vote for Smith the figure was only 33%.</p> <p><strong>4 - Women seem to be more pro-Corbyn than men. </strong>The YouGov crosstabs have 67% of female members of the Labour selectorate backing Corbyn, but only 57% of men. Crosstab findings are less reliable than the headline poll findings (because they involve a smaller sample), but a 10-point gap is quite big, and so some gender gap is probably real. During the campaign <a href=\"http://www.newstatesman.com/2016/07/four-times-owen-smith-has-made-sexist-comments\">Smith has been accused of sexism,</a> and Corbyn\u2019s advantage with women may be a result.</p> <p><strong>5 - Corbyn\u2019s support is broadly consistent amongst all age groups. </strong>It is often assumed that his backing comes from the young. But the crosstabs (in so far as they are reliable - see above) suggest age is not a factor in his support. His ratings are 61% amongst 18 to 24-year-olds, 64% amongst 25 to 39-year-olds, 63% amongst 40 to 59-year-olds and 57% amongst over-60s.</p> <p><strong>6 - A majority of Labour members are in favour of getting rid of the nuclear deterrent. </strong>Some 53% of those voting in the leadership contest, and 52% of those voting because they are full party members, think Britain should get rid of nuclear missiles. Only 23% of party members favour full Trident renewal, while another 14% of members favour replacing the Trident submarines but not equipping them with nuclear missiles. These figures suggest Corbyn, who is in favour of nuclear disarmament, would be able to win a vote on Trident if he put it to a ballot of party members. But this would involve bypassing the normal policy-making procedure, a vote at party conference. Corbyn would find it much harder to win a conference vote on this because unions have 50% of the vote at conference and the big unions are pro-Trident because they want to preserve defence jobs.</p> <p><strong>7 - Corbyn\u2019s supporters are more likely to leave the Labour party if they do not get the leader they want than Smith\u2019s. </strong>Corbyn\u2019s supporters sometimes accuse their opponents of wanting to split the party <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jul/31/owen-smiths-team-says-corbyn-reluctant-to-take-part-in-live-debates\">(John McDonnell has said this explicitly.)</a> But the YouGov poll suggests the Corbynistas would be more likely to walk away. Asked what would happen if Corbyn won, and his opponents formed a rival party, 18% of members said they would leave and join it. But when asked what would happen if Smith won, and his opponents formed a rival party, 32% of members said they would leave and join it.</p> <p><em>UPDATE:</em> On Twitter and perhaps BTL (I have\u2019t read comments yet) readers have challenged this on a couple of grounds.</p> <p>First, Genie Research points out that, given there are almost twice as many Corbyn backers as Smith backers, it is not surprising that Corbyn backers seem more included to split.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/genieresearch/status/770932197041770496\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/AndrewSparrow\">@AndrewSparrow</a> Maths is wrong on 7/10: Corbynite Propensity To Leave = 32/62 = 52%; Smithite PTL = 18/38 = 47%. A very small gap - half each</p>&mdash; Genie Research (@genieresearch) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/genieresearch/status/770932197041770496\">August 31, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>The crosstabs present slightly different figures. Amongst those planning to vote Corbyn, 54% would join a new party if they did not get the leadership result they wanted. Amongst Smith supporters, the figure is 45%. So there is a difference - but it is not a big one.</p> <p>Second, some readers think the first sentence in paragraph 7 is misleading because the YouGov questions were based on the assumption that MPs might split and form a new party, and arguably it is the anti-Corbynites in the PLP who are most likely to do this. It is certainly true that no pro-Corbyn MPs have been talking about forming a new party if Corbyn loses. But anti-Corbyn MPs do not seem to be seriously talking about a new party either. There are reports that some of them are considering setting up a new gropu in parliament. But launching an entirely new party would be hugely problematic, and I am not aware of any MP advocating this.</p> <p>What is true is that some people who used to support other parties (eg, the Greens, TUSC) have joined Labour because they like Corbyn. It is easy to see them leaving if he were replaced - although that is not the same as them defecting to form a new party.</p> <p><strong>8 - More than a third of those voting in the contest (39%) think it is likely the Labour will split when it is over.</strong><br></p> <p><strong>9 - Almost half of those voting in the contest (48%) think Labour MPs should be subjected to mandatory reselection.</strong></p> <p><strong>10 - The traingate controversy damaged Corbyn\u2019s standing in the contest - but not by much. </strong>Some 20% of those voting in the contest said they had a more negative view of him as a result of it, against 10% who said they had a more positive view of him as a result. Almost 70% said it had no effect on their thinking.</p> <p>As I said earlier (see <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/aug/31/corbyn-labour-leadership-yougov-poll-leadership-with-increased-majority-poll-suggests-politics-live?page=with:block-57c685f6e4b0f6cb85628930#block-57c685f6e4b0f6cb85628930\">9.02am)</a> YouGov\u2019s record last year suggests this poll is likely to be a reasonably reliable guide to the eventual outcome.

Our survey sample is composed of 1,236 members of the Labour selectorate, with the representation levels of difference membership types (member/supporter/union affiliate) based on how each group turned out in the 2015 leadership election. Changes in turnout have the potential to affect the results: this is particularly true of trade union affiliates (amongst whom turnout was low in 2015) given that the GMB is under new leadership and has come out for Smith this time round.</p> <p>The make-up of registered supporters is also difficult to judge, whilst the effects and scale of Labour party membership suspensions also has the potential to make a difference. Last, but not least, there are still three weeks left to vote, and unforeseen events could drastically affect the course of the contest. Nevertheless, Team Corbyn will be pleased by the security afforded by the double digit lead they are currently sitting on.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-08-31T11:21:43.559Z\">at 12.21pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57c697c1e4b0df5f040dbec4\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-08-31T08:54:44.820Z\">9.54am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Anna Soubry,</strong> the Conservative former business minister and an opponent of Brexit, was on the Today programme this morning being interviewed ahead of today\u2019s cabinet meeting at Chequers (which she is not attending, obviously.)

The challenge claims that some of the EDF board members who voted in favour of Hinkley Point represent companies that are EDF customers and could benefit from the UK contract. French firms Bouygues and Vallourec have denied that members of their boards who are also on the board of EDF had a conflict of interest in their Hinkley Point vote. </p> <p>Laurent Langlard, spokesman for the national mines and energy branch of the powerful CGT union which is supporting the court action brought by the five board members, said: \u201cWe\u2019re worried. We have never been against the Hinkley Point project in itself. Our concern is the timing. This project can\u2019t be charged into too fast. EDF\u2019s economic situation is serious. More time has to be taken for full feedback and lessons to be learnt. So we want the board decision annulled and we want a full debate at board level.\u201d</p> <p>He said ensuring that EDF could financially stay on its feet was paramount and the company should take two more years to study and prepare the project. </p> <p> The complaint is the latest in several objections to Hinkley Point by workers at EDF. It follows previous legal efforts by several of EDF\u2019s unions to block and then overturn the approval of the project, which they consider a huge financial risk to the heavily indebted company.</p> <p> The unions argue that Levy and representatives of the French state should have informed the board that they knew the British government wanted to take more time to review the contract. </p> <p>Hours after EDF\u2019s board approved the project last month, the UK government <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jul/30/nuclear-power-hinkley-point\">postponed its decision</a> until early autumn. Days later, in an email to top EDF executives, Levy admitted that the night before the board meeting he had been told the new prime minister Theresa May wanted a bit more time. He said he had learned that May \u201cwas asking for a little more time, without reassessing the project, without giving the date when it could be signed\u201d. </p> <p>However, the unions said that at the board meeting \u201cthe British desire to proceed very quickly was again presented as a reason to quickly sign\u201d the deal. Levy has denied lying to board members, saying he was not aware that the British government would in fact announce hours later a review of the project.</p> <p>The nuclear reactors carry huge risks for both France and Britain. EDF will assume the upfront costs, which unions say could jeopardise the firm\u2019s survival, while Britain has committed to pay a price twice current market levels for the power generated by the plant. </p> <p>\u201cSome board members discovered they did not benefit from the same level of information as the CEO and government representative,\u201d the CGT, CFE-CGC and FO unions said. The moderate CFDT union did not sign the statement. </p> <p>The unions added there was no justification to push the board to vote on the project in a hurry. The unions warned earlier this month that this amounted to a \u201cgovernance scandal\u201d.</p> <p>The French government has been keen to get Hinkley Point approved as it sees the project as crucial for the long-term viability of France\u2019s nuclear industry, which employs 220,000 people.<br></p> <p> Previous British governments have also been in favour because the reactors would cover up to 7% of Britain\u2019s electricity needs while helping the government meet its CO2 emissions targets.</p> <p> But British support is not unanimous, and criticism focuses on the growing difference between an electricity price guarantee for EDF, subsidised by the British taxpayer, and current falling energy prices.</p> <p> There have also been national security concerns about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/11/the-guardian-view-on-doing-business-with-china-not-a-question-of-whether-but-when-and-how\">Chinese involvement</a> in the project \u2013 Beijing has a one-third stake in the plan.</p> <p> A date for a Paris court hearing should be set on 5 September.</p> <p> EDF is also being sued by its Works Council, which also wants to annul the vote because it argues it had not received the necessary documents from management to give non-binding preliminary advice to the company.</p>",

Telling off Trump might score him some short-term political points, pundits say \u2013 though the president tends to talk in off-scripted statements and in a stiff prose, heavy on protocol, which doesn\u2019t lend itself to strong comments or verbal jousting. <br></p> <p>\u201c[He\u2019s] become a propaganda tool for the country\u2019s worst enemy,\u201d wrote <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jshm00\">Jes\u00fas Silva Herzog</a>, a political analyst, adding: \u201cNo. This isn\u2019t a calculated risk.

Here there\u2019s nothing to gain. The upside is all for Trump.\u201d</p> <p>Historically, the golden rule of Mexico\u2019s foreign policy has been to avoid being seen as taking sides in US politics; hence the two invitations, even though Mexico favours Clinton\u2019s position on a path to citizenship for migrants.</p> <p>Pe\u00f1a Nieto acknowledged he had invited both candidates, and said he did it because \u201cI believe in dialogue to promote Mexico\u2019s interests and above all to protect Mexicans everywhere.\u201d</p> <p><strong> </strong>Mexicans have already made \u2013 and beaten to a pulp \u2013 pi\u00f1atas of Trump in response to his constant derogatory comments. They created a video game in which players can throw soccer balls, cactus leaves and tequila bottles at a cartoon image of Trump. </p> <p>But his rhetoric especially spooks the political and business classes, which have pursued closer ties with the UUS over the past 25 years and bet heavily on the North America Free Trade Agreement \u2013 an agreement Trump wants to renegotiate or rip up altogether \u2013 only to experience a rise in nativism and an anti-Mexican backlash.</p> <p>Some among Mexico\u2019s working classes, meanwhile, seemed less disturbed by a Trump visit. \u201cHe\u2019s welcome with open arms,\u201d said Efrain Rodr\u00edguez, a hotel employee in the south-eastern city of Villahermosa. \u201cEveryone has their culture, their beliefs. We need to learn more about it.\u201d</p> <p>Trump is expected to meet Pe\u00f1a Nieto at some point in the middle of the day before travelling to Phoenix, Arizona, to deliver an address on immigration.</p>",

  "<p>There is a reason why writing teenage girls is hard. It\u2019s because you\u2019re not just writing one character, you\u2019re writing a flat-share. They\u2019re all living in the one brain, like oestrogen-ed up Young Ones. They have the body of a woman and the brain of a child, or a toddler on Sunny-D, or a world-weary sea captain sucking on a fag and staring into the abyss. They can go from Jessica Rabbit to Josef Mengele within one X Factor ad break. Which is why they\u2019re utterly brilliant, of course, and should be documented for always. </p> <p>This week, Channel 4 shows Ellen, an unflinching closeup of a neglected 14-year-old girl in London. The first work by writer Sarah Quintrell, it\u2019s a sparse study of a vulnerable girl slipping through the cracks. Ellen is what happens when you follow the rowdy, twerking, terrifyingly confident girls off the top deck of the bus, and round the corner into the quiet moments, the creeping silences and bad choices.</p> <p>Ellen, played by Jessica Barden, is a gobby, paint-huffing hellion, friendless and flailing as her gran dies in the box-room and her mother parties with a bleak conga-line of awful men.

You understand immediately how every character has got here. </p> <p>Ellen is torn between her new friend Kayla, who appears to have the life she wants, and Jason, a morally ambiguous \u201cbigger boy\u201d who can offer her free iPhones and cocaine. It\u2019s a brutal 90 minutes, as adulthood is figuratively and literally thrust upon her. I won\u2019t lie \u2013 it\u2019s a rough watch. Ellen is what happens when no one takes the time to hear the \u201chelp me\u201d behind the \u201cfuck off\u201d. But the moments when it grasps you by the heart are the glimpses of teenage normalcy: Ellen and Kayla discussing pubic hair (\u201cI just got \u2019em, I\u2019m not cutting them off again\u201d), doing make-overs and yelling off railway bridges because it feels good to do that.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f9c8c01d07b05019c6c6cf20d1cde87e31547ad1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f9c8c01d07b05019c6c6cf20d1cde87e31547ad1/0_0_2000_1513/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Gobby, paint-huffing hellion Ellen (Jessica Barden) with her friend Kayla (Yasmin Monet Prince).\" width=\"1000\" height=\"756\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Gobby, paint-huffing hellion Ellen (Jessica Barden) with her friend Kayla (Yasmin Monet Prince).</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Huw John/Channel 4</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>As a comedy nerd, I grew up on a diet of Freaks and Geeks, Darlene from Roseanne, Daria, and even the equal-opportunities mankiness of Two Pints of Lager and a Packet of Crisps.

I asked if anyone could recommend recent dramas about young women.

Ellen is about a victim \u2013 and an important watch because of it \u2013 but it also serves to show how rarely we get to see the other side of being a young woman: the brilliant, giggling, un-apologetically weird bits. </p> <p>We need more of this.

  "<p>Nothing in golf is as tribal as the Ryder Cup, which forms part of its very appeal. This week has also been a reminder that nothing polarises views within the sport as much as its captain\u2019s picks. Darren Clarke is the latest to discover that you cannot please all of the people all of the time, as the wave of criticism that will surround wildcard choices will attest. In part this is ludicrous; Clarke has a sole objective, to win the Ryder Cup. It is his reputation at stake, far more so than having a desire to play favourites or politics.</p> <p>In this instance the scenario is not black and white at all. Just as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/30/ryder-cup-darren-clarke-wildcards\" title=\"\">the selection of Thomas Pieters for a European debut</a> at Hazeltine in a month\u2019s time is perfectly valid, Russell Knox is entitled to feel he has suffered serious misfortune by missing out. Even Clarke himself, who clearly didn\u2019t enjoy breaking the bad news to Knox, would admit as much.</p> <p>Clarke\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/30/thomas-pieters-impresses-tiger-woods-darren-clarke-europe-ryder-cup\" title=\"\">faith in Pieters must not be understated</a>. This isn\u2019t a novel position; there has been talk of an emerging, brilliant Belgian in golf circles for years. Pieters was a successful amateur, including in the United States. The trouble was, up until a year ago there looked a real danger of him not fulfilling his promise.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/30/ryder-cup-darren-clarke-rookies-prosper\">Darren Clarke backs his Ryder Cup wild cards and rookies</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The combination of immense driving distance \u2013 perhaps second only to Rory McIlroy in this European side and an average of 20 yards longer than Knox \u2013 and a terrific short game should make Pieters a formidable Ryder Cup player. And should is the word, given it is not possible to analyse properly whether or not Clarke has done the right thing by placing his faith in the 24-year-old until after the event has taken place. All we can say for now is that the Northern Irishman is comfortable and confident with Pieters as part of his contingent. Which, presumably, is the most important thing here.</p> <p>This, however, is neither a slight on Knox nor the scandal some would portray. The omission of the 31-year-old isn\u2019t, for example, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/lawrence-donegan-golf-blog/2010/sep/01/ryder-cup-team-paul-casey\" title=\"\">comparable to Colin Montgomerie\u2019s refusal to pick Paul Casey</a> in 2010 when the Englishman was both the holder of an excellent match-play record and ranked inside the world\u2019s top 10. But Europe won, therefore Montgomerie was vindicated.</p> <p>Clarke\u2019s position here was made complicated by the make-up of Europe\u2019s automatic qualifiers. With five rookies in that group, the picking of more than \u2013 or even \u2013 one more debutant always looked a gamble. Lee Westwood and Martin Kaymer have done enough this year to justify Hazeltine places but their experience is also necessary, meaning the prospect of Pieters and Knox both being picked \u2013 for which there is otherwise a good case \u2013 was never a live one.</p> <p>On Tuesday, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/30/thomas-pieters-impresses-tiger-woods-darren-clarke-europe-ryder-cup\" title=\"\">Knox\u2019s response to non-selection was typically impressive</a>. For starters, he was happy to field media calls on the topic and, while his disappointment was obvious, there was no sniping or whining about what had taken place. Knox was pragmatic, mature and candid. Not for the first time, his outlook was to be admired.</p> <p>Yes, he might have played in the Wyndham Championship this month and qualified for the European team but, by the same token, he could have been an automatic entrant anyway but for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/may/15/russell-knox-made-light-nine-shots-17th-hole-players-championship-sawgrass\" title=\"\">a memorable catastrophe on the 17th tee at Sawgrass </a>earlier in the year. Knox didn\u2019t seem particularly bothered by ifs and buts and projected himself as a young man content with life. For all that Knox is ranked higher in the world than seven of Europe\u2019s team, that owes plenty to the vagaries of the qualifying process rather than something Clarke can control.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"995271eb770ed4d28db04b621d6bd650266ebcdd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/995271eb770ed4d28db04b621d6bd650266ebcdd/0_173_4602_2761/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Russell Knox was overlooked for the final 12 despite the Scotsman\u2019s meteoric rise up the rankings in the past year.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Russell Knox was overlooked for the final 12 despite the Scotsman\u2019s meteoric rise up the rankings in the past year.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Cannon/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Should Knox\u2019s dejection deepen as the Ryder Cup approaches, he might look back on how his career his blossomed. His route is inspirational to golfers who perhaps think they cannot compete with the world\u2019s best. This is a youngster from the Highlands of Scotland who didn\u2019t make huge amateur inroads and wasn\u2019t a high-ranking college player. Yet he progressed through minor tours and enjoyed a rocket-fuelled run that has taken him to world No20 and within three tournaments of the $10m FedEx Cup bounty. Knox\u2019s late entry into a WGC event last year and subsequent victory there was the stuff of fairytale. At that juncture, the Ryder Cup hadn\u2019t even been on his horizon, meaning it would be a shame if his non-appearance there now causes him any disillusionment.</p> <p>We may never truly know how much external factors played a part in the Pieters call. There has long been a sense, for example, that full-time European Tour players would be favoured for picks as a means to retain the Tour\u2019s profile. Knox not playing at Wyndham was significant, of that there is no doubt, and Clarke may have been happy for him to secure automatic qualification there had he played. However, perhaps Knox felt he had already stated his case and was concerned by a congested schedule, which is to be respected.</p> <p>Intriguing, too, was Knox\u2019s selection of a Challenge Tour player and long-time friend, Duncan Stewart, as his partner at golf\u2019s World Cup. This didn\u2019t go down well with, among others, the Ryder Cup vice-captain Paul Lawrie. And yet, it would seem petty if another pick policy was used in direct reply.</p> <p>One of the most telling comments by Clarke on Tuesday related to the wild card process itself. \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/aug/31/oliver.wilson\" title=\"\">In 2008 I did not make the team automatically</a> and I realised, if you do not make the team, you are at the mercy of the captain\u2019s thoughts,\u201d said Clarke. \u201cThat\u2019s the way it is. That\u2019s just the hard facts about the whole thing.\u201d</p> <p>Clarke\u2019s decisions are far less sensational than some perceive. It is also his neck on the line.</p>",

But the real cause of public disgruntlement is the draining away of power to transnational corporations who operate in a limboland beyond national borders, and the politicians who do not have the courage to stand up against the bullying of these corporations.</p> <p>Apple has benefited from both a favourable Irish tax regime and the notorious <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/oct/13/ireland-close-double-irish-tax-loophole\" title=\"\">\u201cdouble Irish\u201d</a> scheme, exploiting the fact that revenues declared as earned by subsidiaries or Irish companies outside its territory are not liable to tax. This, combined with the fact that US corporations can defer paying taxes on foreign income, creates a tax incentive for multinational corporations to effectively be resident nowhere. For Apple, this meant holding $187bn outside the US in 2015, a considerable share of the total $1.2tn that US multinationals have parked offshore. If the company were to repatriate their profits in the US they would face a corporate tax rate of 35%, so they log it in Ireland and leave it offshore.</p> <p>The US Treasury has been swift to attack Brussels\u2019 attempts to ensure that a fair rate of tax is paid, getting its retaliation in first in the form of a report last week accusing the commission of acting like a <a href=\"https://www.cchdaily.co.uk/us-treasury-hits-out-supra-national-eu-probe-apple-tax\" title=\"\">\u201csupranational tax authority\u201d</a>. This is a classic example of an economic rival deliberately undermining cooperation between European partners to benefit its own multinational corporations. We should celebrate the fact that the European commission is acting to protect citizens against excessive corporate power. In the global economy the real division is not between nation states but between citizens and corporations.</p> <p>This is not the first time faceless Brussels bureaucrats have been sticking their noses into others\u2019 business, namely giant corporations and the way they do business in Europe. Shortly before the referendum, the commission launched proposals on public <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/country-by-country-reporting-updated\" title=\"\">country by country reporting</a> (CBCR), ensuring the public disclosure of where companies do business, employ people, declare profits and pay taxes. this was all in the interests of transparency, and the need to hold corporations to account.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/30/apple-tax-avoidance-vindication-protest-ttip\">Apple must now pay its taxes.

I believe leave voters had a justifiable sense that we are all losing control over our work, and our public sphere. Unfortunately, with the EU, they chose the wrong target. As Vestager has proved, many of our most urgent problems can only be solved by cross-border cooperation.</p> <p>No one country alone can resist the power of global corporations; to do this we need to work in cooperation with other countries. Ironically, the Brexit vote reduces our power to ensure corporations pay the taxes we need to build a thriving society and a flourishing economy.

You know, now they want to bring us irrigation systems from Israel. But we have our own systems.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2016/aug/28/reindeer-conservation-threatens-ruination-mongolia-dukha\">'We have nothing but our reindeer': conservation threatens ruination for Mongolia's Dukha</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cWe know how to grow wheat and corn.

Now, conservation and tourists have arrived. They\u2019re all just passing through. Us, we\u2019re staying.\u201d</p> <p>Tourism has had a major impact. In 1990, the Chilean government established the <a href=\"http://www.visitchile.com/en/los-flamencos-national-reserve/\">Los Flamencos national reserve</a>. Rather than resist the move, the Lickan Antay \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.iwgia.org/images/stories/sections/regions/latin-america/documents/IW2016/Chile_IW2016_web_redu.pdf\">who, along with other indigenous peoples of Chile, are among the poorest in the country</a> (pdf)  \u2013 chose to negotiate and adapt. The national reserve is the first example in Chile of the co-management of a protected area by the state and indigenous people.</p> <p>It is now seen as a strategic alliance that allows the government and the people to preserve the environment more effectively, and channel tourism. The co-management agreement also allows the Lickan Antay to attract other opportunities for development.</p> <p>Leticia Gonz\u00e1lez-Silvestre was born in Toconau, one of the desert villages of the Lickan Antay. After studying away from home, she has returned with an agricultural engineering diploma.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c5cd083ed507ad825aa2f2a8a26c40ad73b3b8fa\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c5cd083ed507ad825aa2f2a8a26c40ad73b3b8fa/0_0_2560_1706/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Leticia Gonz\u00e1lez-Silvestre, of the Lickan Antay\" width=\"1000\" height=\"666\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Leticia Gonz\u00e1lez-Silvestre, a respected member of the indigenous council.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Riccardo Pravettoni</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>She says co-management of the reserve has given them employment and training opportunities. The communities have formed a non-profit association to collect and redistribute money earned from the reserve. \u201cIt\u2019s a benefit in terms of economics and development, but it\u2019s also a recognition of our culture. We continue to negotiate an increasingly important part of the management, taking advantage of the fact that the government has neither the capacity nor the means to invest more.\u201d</p> <p>The national forest corporation, <a href=\"http://www.conaf.cl/\">Conaf</a>, which coordinates the management of protected areas for the government, says the collaboration allows it to fill a gap in its teams. Alejandro Santoro, Conaf\u2019s regional director, says: \u201cThis gives us a constant and broader view of the situation. This way, the Lickan Antay are assimilated like personnel.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a positive approach,\u201d adds Ivonne Valenzuela, who is in charge of a Conaf unit<strong> </strong>dedicated to relations with indigenous communities. \u201cThe model we\u2019ve adopted is to engage in contracts with the communities. In this way, they can benefit from tourism while we concentrate on the protection of biodiversity. We work with them on many aspects of the management of the reserve, and on the planning and management of eco-tourism projects.\u201d</p> <p>But not everyone is happy about the surge in the number of tourists spending time in the<strong> </strong>reserve, which is now the second most visited in Chile, with <a href=\"http://www.conaf.cl/wp-content/files_mf/1454955121Tot_a%C3%B1o_2015.pdf\">more than 300,000 visitors a year</a> (pdf). While some welcome the economic advantages, others are concerned about the establishment of tour companies and agencies that ignore the Lickan Antay\u2019s customs and, in some instances, deny their existence.</p> <p>The small town of San Pedro de Atacama is a succession of hotels, restaurants, bars, souvenir shops and tourist agencies. Nights are festive, the restaurants offer international cuisine and the wisest visitors go to bed early to be ready for their treks to discover the geysers and flamingos of the salt flats.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--immersive\" data-media-id=\"6c8795d23ae9746d9b579da9019b974fefa13ca1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6c8795d23ae9746d9b579da9019b974fefa13ca1/0_0_2560_1706/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The landscape around San Pedro de Atacama\" width=\"1000\" height=\"666\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">San Pedro de Atacama lies in a region of volcanoes and salt flats, in an arid high plateau of the Andes mountains.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Riccardo Pravettoni</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cAll that interests them is filling the bus and visiting the sites, not experiencing a different way of life,\u201d says Sandra Flores, one of the Lickan Antay, who runs a small tourism company, <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/caravana.ancestral\">Caravana Ancestral</a>.</p> <p>\u201cFor us it\u2019s very difficult to know that our existence is negated in this way. And we\u2019re unable to get a foothold in the tourism market. The guides say the desert is empty, that there are no more indigenous people. Sure, we\u2019re not in San Pedro, but we\u2019re everywhere in the desert. We dedicate ourselves to our animals, to farming the land.</p> <p>\u201cBefore the creation of the reserve there wasn\u2019t a single tourist, and suddenly they\u2019re everywhere. We haven\u2019t had the time to react and to learn how to set up commercial establishments. But we exist. And our existence is a constant battle.\u201d </p> <p>Flores set up her business four years ago. She and several members of the community receive tourists in their homes, share a moment together to talk about their way of life, let tourists take out the llamas, and show visitors a Lickan Antay archeological site. But none of them speak fluent English and the business is not well established.</p> <p>However, the most serious impact of the tourism explosion has been to put pressure on the precarious water situation. The hundreds of hotels being built in San Pedro guzzle water.</p> <p>\u201cThe hotels wanted to buy land and we sold it to them. Already we didn\u2019t have enough water to farm, and now we have to go to another river to fetch water, one we didn\u2019t go to before,\u201d says L\u00f3pez Ramo.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e2510b709b0a67dce6d802c5dddaed7e3fd4d240\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e2510b709b0a67dce6d802c5dddaed7e3fd4d240/0_0_2560_1706/1000.jpg\" alt=\"San Pedro de Atacama, a town full of bars, restaurants and tourist agencies\" width=\"1000\" height=\"666\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">San Pedro de Atacama, a focus for tourism within the Atacama desert.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Riccardo Pravettoni</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Because of the hotels, some of the Lickan Antay who live close to San Pedro say, their usual water source dried up. The community no longer has easy access to drinking water, and is forced to use supplies that have passed through a salt desert, meaning the water is more salinated.</p> <p>The Lickan Antay have also been forbidden from selling their vegetables and fruit to tourists as they cannot guarantee that their water source is not polluted. </p> <p>Gonz\u00e1lez-Silvestre concludes: \u201cThe problem with tourism is that it\u2019s not regulated. It\u2019s like wine: one wants to say, \u2018It\u2019s a good antioxidant.\u2019 Yes, but if you drink litres every day, you\u2019re not going to feel good.\u201d</p> <p>Felipe Guerra Schleef is a lawyer for the indigenous rights NGO <a href=\"http://observatorio.cl/\">Observatorio Ciudadano</a>. Convinced of the necessity for his country to conserve its cultural and natural heritage, he has defended indigenous people in cases where their land rights have been violated and resources exploited. \u201cThe indigenous people develop their culture according to the land itself.

  "<p>Clashes between opposition supporters and security forces broke out in the capital of Gabon on Wednesday after Ali Bongo, the incumbent president, was controversially declared the winner of Saturday\u2019s election, extending the rule of one of Africa\u2019s longest political dynasties to more than 50 years. </p> <p>Three people were apparently shot dead by security forces and many more wounded after crowds tried to storm the offices of the electoral commission in Libreville shortly after authorities announced Bongo\u2019s re-election by a narrow majority.</p> <p>There were reports that protesters had set fire to part of Gabon\u2019s parliament building. A witness told Reuters that demonstrators entering from the back of the National Assembly started the blaze and firefighters were trying to extinguish it.</p> <p>Bongo won 49.80% of the vote against 48.23% for his rival, Jean Ping, adding another seven years to his family\u2019s half-century rule of the central African country. The announcement of the result was repeatedly delayed, and opposition supporters on Wednesday cried foul over what they claimed were voting irregularities in at least one of the country\u2019s nine provinces.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8739f95b64e91ac7b079461f93a611762850e847\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8739f95b64e91ac7b079461f93a611762850e847/0_230_3600_2160/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Supporters of Jean Ping rally in Libreville in front of a poster of President Ali Bongo Ondimba.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Supporters of Jean Ping rally in Libreville in front of a poster of President Ali Bongo Ondimba.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Marco Longari/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Bongo\u2019s father, Omar Bongo, ruled the country for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/may/05/1\">more than 40 years</a>, squandering much of its vast oil wealth and hiding it overseas rather than using it to lift its people out of poverty. Bongo Junior, as Ali is known, has tried to distance himself from the sins of his father, but the apparent manipulation of the vote in at least one province has attracted much criticism.</p> <p>Many Gabonese ventured out early on Wednesday to stock up on groceries, anticipating the violent clashes between protesters and the armed forces, which were deployed to the streets of Libreville on Tuesday.<br></p> <p>The army fired stun grenades and teargas at a crowd of people outside the headquarters of the electoral commission shouting \u201cAli must go!\u201d According to Ping, they also fired live bullets, which he said killed three and wounded many. Bongo\u2019s aides denied this and accused the opposition of fabricating rumours.<br></p> <p>The first battle was not fought on Libreville\u2019s potholed streets, however, but in an obscure corner of Wikipedia. Overnight, there were more than <a href=\"https://fr.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Haut-Ogoou%C3%A9&amp;dir=prev&amp;offset=20160831010801&amp;limit=560&amp;action=history\">100 modifications</a> to the online encyclopedia\u2019s page on Haut Ogoou\u00e9, a Gabonese province.<br></p> <p>One minute its population was 54,000, the next 250,000. Then it was changed back.<br></p> <p>In Gabon\u2019s election, much rested on how many voters there were in Haut Ogoou\u00e9, the last province to be counted, and which way they voted.<br></p> <p>According to the electoral commission, 99.9% of the province, Bongo\u2019s home region, took part in the vote, and 95% of them voted for him. The question on the lips of many Gabonese citizens was why there was such a high turnout in Haut Ogoou\u00e9, when nationally it was 59%.<br></p> <p>However, Bongo scored lower than his father, who famously won 100% of the national vote in the 1986 election, with a 99.9% turnout, when Gabon was still a one-party state.<br></p> <p>Ping, a half-Chinese diplomat who was previously one of the Bongo family\u2019s most trusted cronies, rejected the result and demanded a recount in Haut Ogoou\u00e9.<br></p> <p>He said: \u201cThe citizens of Gabon peacefully and respectfully exercised their right to freely and fairly choose our country\u2019s next president. The current president, Ali Bongo, did not approve of their choice, so he substituted his will for theirs. <br>  \u201cAli Bongo wants the Gabonese people and the entire world to believe his \u2018results\u2019 that he took three days behind closed doors to concoct. The Gabonese people and the world can clearly see the fraud, lies, and manipulation behind a \u201899.9%\u2019 voter turnout in the areas where he \u2018won\u2019 \u2013 also by a truly unbelievable \u201895%\u2019 \u2013 including thousands of voters who don\u2019t even exist or are currently alive there. <br></p> <p> \u201c\u2018Results\u2019 like Ali Bongo\u2019s are the hallmarks of dictators and tyrants who refuse to give up power \u2013 not the cornerstones of democracies, nations, and peoples who respect fairness and the rule of law.\u201d</p> <p>Ping added: \u201cTo use one province to impose a coup in the country could have serious consequences for national unity.\u201d</p> <p>Opposition parties united behind Ping just a week before the election. His party claimed victory very early on, as did Bongo.<br></p> <p>The national election commission (Cenap) was due to announce the result on Tuesday afternoon at 5pm local time. As the nation held its breath and turned on its televisions to learn its fate, however, Cenap failed to appear, and nervous voters were instead treated to reruns of Hannah Montana, the American TV series that made Miley Cyrus famous. Cenap officials surfaced nearly a full day later.<br></p> <p>Many Gabonese also pointed out that five days to count 600,000 votes \u2013 Gabon is a country with vast rainforests but a tiny population \u2013 was excessive.<br></p> <p>Ping had been expected to win, according to Fran\u00e7ois Conradie, an analyst from NKC African Economics.<br></p> <p>\u201cWe think, based on what the opposition has reported and on what sources have told us about people\u2019s voting preferences in Gabon, that Mr Ping won more votes than Mr Bongo,\u201d Conradie said.<br></p> <p>A smiling Bongo said the election had been \u201chotly contested, strong and democratic\u201d, adding that he \u201cdeplored the excesses of the campaign and the attempts at destabilisation that we have, partly, been able to thwart\u201d.<br></p> <p>Ping painted a less rosy picture for the future of the Bongo dynasty. \u201cTheir ship is sinking \u2013 even the rats are starting to leave it. We are cleaning out Gabon,\u201d he said.</p> <p><br></p> <p><br></p> <p><br></p> <p><br></p> <p><br></p>",

Over the sombre psych-soul of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYIWebkeFMg\">I\u2019ll Stay</a> (and the drums from Melvin Bliss\u2019 1974 track, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDHwtC5iv1U\">Synthetic Substitution</a>), Plugs One and Two relate a haunting, heartbreaking tale of a teenage schoolmate being sexually molested by her father. The MCs\u2019 displaced narration, chronicling Millie\u2019s nightmare but instantly dismissing her claims out of affection for her father, is a masterstroke, making them complicit in a narrative that ends with Millie shooting her father while he works his shift as a department store Santa. From the seemingly seductive spoken-word intro (\u201cIf you will suck my soul, I will lick your funky emotions\u201d) to the father\u2019s abrupt death (\u201cMillie bucked him and with the quickness it was over\u201d), the listener can\u2019t help feeling queasily complicit. De La might not get the heavy rotation of Slade and Wizzard in the Card Factory each yuletide, but this song, for different reasons, lodges just as well in the memory.</p> <h2><strong>5.<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QU9jrGNgX4Y\"> Breakadawn</a></strong></h2> <p>De La exhaled with 1993\u2019s Buhloone Mind State, dispensing with their trademark skits and narrative arcs for a groove-oriented aesthetic that, in keeping with the times, was relaxed and inflected with soul and jazz. Nowhere is this vibe more evident than on the album\u2019s twinkly first single, which finds Pos and Dove \u2013 now, in fact, just plain old Dave \u2013 scattering their humble, gem-studded rhymes (not to mention Star Trek, REM and Phil Collins references) over a blissful backdrop that combines samples of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnhWML43NI8\">Michael Jackson\u2019s I Can\u2019t Help It</a> and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCZ22D2SRD0\">Smokey Robinson\u2019s Quiet Storm</a>. Somewhat lost in the shuffle of one of hip-hop\u2019s greatest years (it\u2019s mind-boggling that De La\u2019s buddies A Tribe Called Quest released Midnight Marauders on the same day the Wu-Tang Clan dropped their debut), Buhloone Mindstate has since gained a reputation as the connoisseur\u2019s choice. Tracks like Breakadawn are the reason why.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLNVnmq9Tpv3qmM-QNczNuIZztuIHk4pIR\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"345\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/videoseries?wmode=opaque&list=PLNVnmq9Tpv3qmM-QNczNuIZztuIHk4pIR\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>De La Soul\u2019s 10 of the Best \u2013 a YouTube playlist</figcaption> </figure>   <h2><strong>6. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYn6u7uNI-g\">I Am I Be</a></strong></h2> <p>Just as Tribe convinced jazz great Ron Carter to lug his bass into the studio for 1991\u2019s The Low End Theory, so De La recruited Maceo Parker, Fred Wesley and Pee Wee Ellis \u2013 all from James Brown\u2019s legendary horn section the JBs \u2013 to let loose their lips and lungs on Buhloone Mindstate. If their live blowing, co-existing with samples from <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tY_LJr3-jl0\">Lou Rawls\u2019 You\u2019ve Made Me So Very Happy</a> and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npHqbfCIklw\">Jimmy Ponder\u2019s While My Guitar Gently Weeps</a>, brings a level of rawness and maturity to I Am I Be, it\u2019s more than matched by Posdnuos as he delivers rhymes more personal than at any time before. Many MCs boast about dropping jewels, but Pos\u2019s brilliance as an MC lies is his tendency to tuck them within the verses, leaving listeners to peel back layers of metaphor and abstraction. It\u2019s a style that makes his foray into naked autobiography here all the more arresting: \u201cProduct of a North Carolina cat / Who scratched the back of a pretty woman named Hattie / Who departed life just a little too soon / And didn\u2019t see me grab the Plug Tune fame / As we go a little somethin\u2019 like this / Look, Ma, no protection / Now I got a daughter called Ayana Monet / Play the cowboy to rustle in the dough / So the scenery is healthy where her eyes lay.\u201d In an era when many a stone-faced MC was mumbling \u201cKeep it real\u201d to champion a grim, steely detachment from their surroundings, De La scored with a different interpretation.</p> <h2><strong>7. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwADnQp-pqg\">Stakes Is High</a></strong></h2> <p>The testy title track from De La\u2019s 1996 fourth album, Stakes Is High remains one of hip-hop\u2019s great State of the Union addresses, a bristling broadside against what the trio saw as the culture\u2019s money-mad artistic unravelling. While the outlook may be jaded, the result is anything but. Plugs One and Two\u2019s sound invigorated over a beat by soon-to-blow producer Jay Dee AKA J Dilla that riles up an already irate horn sample from Ahmad Jamal\u2019s Swahililand and augments it with a vocal sample from Brown\u2019s Mind Power. With gems such as \u201cgun control means using both hands in my land\u201d, Pos reinforces his own case that \u201cevery word of mine should be a hip-hop quotable\u201d, before Dave attacks the industry: \u201cI\u2019m sick of bitches shakin\u2019 asses / I\u2019m sick of talkin\u2019 \u2019bout blunts, sick of Versace glasses / Sick of slang, sick of half-ass awards shows / Sick of name brand clothes / Sick of R&amp;B bitches over bullshit tracks / Cocaine and crack, which brings sickness to blacks.\u201d While the war may have ultimately been lost (Puffy\u2019s pleather-and-Rolex rap exploded shortly after), De La\u2019s ideals would be upheld by the burgeoning indie movement that would take root in rap\u2019s underground for the rest of the decade.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwADnQp-pqg\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"345\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/EwADnQp-pqg?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <h2><strong>8. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BpvhPMsGHc\">The Hustle</a></strong></h2> <p>Masters of double meaning and slow-release wordplay, De La could never be charged with lyrical heavy-handedness. That said, their contribution to America Is Dying Slowly, a 1996 Aids awareness record masterminded by the Red Hot organisation, is arguably a little too subtle in conveying the album\u2019s central message. Pos touches on promiscuity in the crew\u2019s line of work (\u201cThe mission of many to be lickin\u2019 honey vixens\u201d), but it\u2019s not until the song\u2019s dying bars that Dave gets on message and, having finished paying tribute to Caddyshack actor Ted Knight, tosses out the line: \u201cIma strap it when Hon wants to tap it.\u201d Of course, none of this matters in the slightest, as The Hustle is basically 3 minutes and 53 seconds of Pos and Trugoy rocking the mic over production by New York stalwarts the Beatminerz. It\u2019s a tougher sound for the Plugs, and it suits them.</p> <h2><strong>9. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avIqTrX2eac\">Oooh</a></strong></h2> <p>Ably assisted by Redman, the Plugs commandeer the dancefloor with this ebullient lead single from Mosaic Thump (their fifth album and the first in a mooted trilogy that stalled with the following year\u2019s sequel, Bionix). While the gloriously silly, cameo-crammed video riffs on The Wizard of Oz and its black remake The Wiz, the track itself has a back-in-the-fold Prince Paul getting similarly cinematic in his sampling. Giving The Night Before Christmas a hip-hop makeover, Dave laments how burglars \u201ctook all the goodies out from under the tree, except the CDs / of shiny-suit rappers and flossin\u2019 MCs\u201d. </p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avIqTrX2eac\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"345\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/avIqTrX2eac?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <h2><strong>10.<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h5t-bI8ZdoU\"> Rock Co. Kane Flow</a></strong></h2> <p>\u201cThey say the good die young, so I added some badass flavour to prolong my life over the drums,\u201d relates Pos on this single from 2004\u2019s The Grind Date. With Dave and Pos puffing out their chests and going toe to toe with the metal-faced supervillain MF Doom, it\u2019s no idle boast. It\u2019s not hard to see why the De La boys might feel a kinship with their guest: as Zev Love X, Doom had been one third of KMD, whose skit-centric, playful debut, Mr Hood, preceded an altogether darker encore: 1993\u2019s Black Bastards, shelved by Elektra because of Doom\u2019s provocative cover illustration of the group\u2019s ironic \u201csambo\u201d mascot hanging from a noose. Certainly, the chemistry between the Plugs and their guest is impeccable as they careen but never collide over a tempo-changing beat by Seattle\u2019s Jake One, wreaking havoc with a murderously chopped sample of Deliverance by French electro pioneers Space. With the MCs serving up a masterclass in mic technique (check out their breathlessly accelerated flows over the beat\u2019s shuddering, stimulating breakdowns), you can\u2019t blame Pos for giving his crew a glowing career appraisal: \u201cEveryone cools off from being hot / It\u2019s about if you can handle being cold or not / And we was told to hop on no one\u2019s dick by Prince Paul / We stayed original ever since, y\u2019all / First to do a lot in the rap game but the last to say it, no need to put it on the scales to weigh it.\u201d Here\u2019s to their continued longevity.</p>",

This week, people are asking. </p> <p>The Maine Council of Churches, which represents Catholic and mainline Protestant denominations, denounced the governor\u2019s \u201cvitriolic personal attack and disrespect\u201d in a statement. \u201cThe words he chose to use in the message and interview were unspeakable \u2013 and yet, he spoke them, disgracing the office of governor and dishonoring our state in the eyes of the nation.\u201d</p> <p>Fellow Republican Amy Volk, a state senator, expressed \u201cdeep concern\u201d about his behavior, \u201cwhether it is due to substance abuse, mental illness, or just ignorance\u201d.</p> <p> LePage\u2019s political career may run aground, but he has been navigating uncharted waters for six years in this rural New England state of 1.3 million, previously known for its civil political discourse and the election of moderates such as US senators Olympia Snowe, Susan Collins and Bill Cohen (Republicans), George Mitchell and Ed Muskie (Democrats), and Angus King (independent).</p> <p> Within days of taking office in 2011, LePage was generating news headlines for telling the NAACP, on television on the eve of the annual Martin Luther King Jr holiday, to \u201ckiss my butt\u201d.</p> <p>He\u2019s since told the public that a Democratic senator liked to \u201cgive it to the people without Vaseline\u201d, that the Internal Revenue Service is akin to the Gestapo, that the state government he oversees is corrupt, and that he\u2019d like to bomb the state\u2019s largest newspaper, the Portland Press Herald. </p> <p> He\u2019s tangled with legislators of both parties, refusing for months to allow his commissioners to testify before legislative committees and, last year, suddenly issuing hundreds of vetoes of bills to retaliate against them for declining to take up his initiative to eliminate the state income tax. (Lawmakers of both parties overturned most of the vetoes.) </p> <p>There were calls for his impeachment last year over an incident in which LePage threatened to cut off state funding to an educational not-for-profit group unless its board reconsidered a decision to hire the outgoing Democratic house speaker, Mark Eves, to lead the organization. Ultimately, legislators took no action and Eves had to find work elsewhere.</p> <p>In a racially charged preamble to the current controversy, LePage told a crowd in January that \u201cguys with the name D-Money, Smoothie, Shifty \u2013 these types of guys\u201d come to Maine \u201cfrom Connecticut and New York\u201d to try to sell heroin and \u201cimpregnate a young white girl before they leave\u201d. Maine is the whitest state in the country, at 96.9%.</p> <p>The state\u2019s top Republicans \u2013 and many Republican voters \u2013 stuck with him after a turbulent first term. He was re-elected with 48% of the vote in a three-way race with the endorsement of Senator Susan Collins and campaign donations from former governor John McKernan and the Pac of his wife, former senator Olympia Snowe. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a052847fc35a0c83295e2513cbb346d45349fcb5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a052847fc35a0c83295e2513cbb346d45349fcb5/0_133_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"People clap during speeches at a rally to protest at recent remarks by Governor Paul LePage in Capital Park in Augusta, Maine, on Tuesday.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">People clap during speeches at a rally to protest at recent remarks by Governor Paul LePage in Capital Park in Augusta, Maine, on Tuesday.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Joe Phelan/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>LePage has always claimed a personal tie to Snowe, who also grew up in Lewiston-Auburn under difficult circumstances. Snowe was orphaned at a young age. LePage, the eldest of 18 children, ran away from home at 11 after his father broke his jaw in one of his frequent child-beating sessions. </p> <p>Raised through the kindness of several area businesspeople, LePage got into college and had his first year\u2019s tuition paid for by lawmaker and businessman Peter Snowe, who would later marry Olympia and who died in a 1973 car accident.</p> <p>LePage thrived in college and went on to a career in business management, eventually specializing in winding down bankrupt companies. He was mayor of Waterville, a town of 16,000, and was elected governor in a tight three-way race in 2010, promising to crack down on welfare cheats, reduce taxes and regulations, and thereby revive the state\u2019s moribund economy. He has said that welfare dependency undermined some of his younger siblings.</p> <p>In the current presidential election cycle, LePage was one of the first sitting governors to endorse Chris Christie for the Republican nomination, then followed Christie in switching his allegiance to Trump. Trump\u2019s campaign recently hired LePage\u2019s daughter as its coalitions director for the state.</p> <p>In the latest controversy, the governor revealed he collects press clippings of drug dealer arrests and keeps them in a three-ring binder. Over 90% of those pictured, he has claimed, are black and Hispanic. FBI data shows black people account for 14.1% of drug arrests in Maine.</p> <p>On Monday, LePage was sticking to his assertions. At a meeting of New England governors in Boston, he said of heroin dealers arrested in Maine: \u201cThey\u2019re Hispanic and they\u2019re black and they\u2019re from Lowell and Lawrence, Massachusetts; Waterbury, Connecticut; and the Bronx and Brooklyn.\u201d It was not clear why the race of the drug dealers was important.</p> <p>On Wednesday, LePage said Wednesday he would not resign.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not an alcoholic, and I\u2019m not a drug addict, and I don\u2019t have mental issues,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat I have is a backbone.\u201d</p> <p>He said instead he would seek \u201cspiritual guidance\u201d. He also <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2016/08/paul-lepage-vows-never-speak-media-227589\">vowed</a> never to speak to the press again, according to Politico. </p> <p>But legislative Republicans might have an incentive to impeach him before the November election, which would make the current president of the state senate, Michael Thibodeau, governor. If Democrats were to recapture control of the state senate, a future impeachment effort could give them the governor\u2019s mansion as well.</p> <ul> <li>This article was amended on 12 September 2016 to clarify that Peter Snowe was a lawmaker and businessman, not an attorney.</li> </ul>",

But the country\u2019s most prominent politicians have pledged to reinstate it, even if it requires <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-religion-burqa-france-idUSKCN1130TW http://www.reuters.com/article/us-religion-burqa-france-idUSKCN1130TW \">changing the constitution</a>. </p> <p>Beaches, in France or Mississippi, bring people to the edge of human existence.</p> <p>Beyond lies the vast, uninhabitable sea, revealing the species as small and temporary. There is no farther place to run, so on continents around the globe people congregate on shores and gaze into the horizon.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s like a mountaintop in a way,\u201d said Professor James Patterson Smith, who researches the coast at the University of Southern Mississippi. \u201cIt\u2019s a place that provides perspective.\u201d</p> <p>There\u2019s also vulnerability in wearing clothes that would seem out of place at a restaurant, library or church. The history of swimwear shows it\u2019s a fickle thing, depending on where a bather entered the water, and in what era.</p> <p>In fourth-century Sicily, women <a href=\"http://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/how-bathing-suits-went-from-two-pieces-to-long-gowns-and-back-134926264/\">wore bikinis</a> according to ancient mosaics. In the 19th century, western women wore canvas \u201cswimming gowns\u201d that reached their ankles and ballooned full of air when they entered the water, so they moved atop the waves like water-borne zeppelins, all femininity obscured.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/24/the-burkini-ban-what-it-really-means-when-we-criminalise-clothes\">The burkini ban: what it really means when we criminalise clothes</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Swimsuits probably reached maximum skin exposure \u2013 peak peek \u2013 in the 1980s, when Austrian-American designer Rudi Gernreich created the topless \u201cmonokini\u201d and the even less-there \u201cpubikini\u201d. He designed the suits as a reaction against the west\u2019s expectations that women should cover themselves; rather they should feel free to choose.</p> <p>His <a href=\"http://articles.latimes.com/1985-08-02/news/vw-5780_1_rudi-gernreich\">1985 manifesto</a> still subverts the norm in France: \u201cI couldn\u2019t help feel the implicit hypocrisy that made something in one culture immoral and in another perfectly acceptable.\u201d </p> <p>All this dressing and undressing, according to Smith, left beachgoers feeling stimulated and perturbed.</p> <p>\u201cIt sexualized the beach,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd that left us highly sensitive to \u2018the other\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>At the beach, he said, we gaze both outward and inward. </p> <h2>\u2018Which bodies can be held in bondage\u2019</h2> <p>In the southern United States, dark-skinned people on the beach represented racial chaos, wherein black people could dilute a social order built on color.</p> <p>\u201cThe main question of the day was which bodies could be held in bondage,\u201d Smith said. \u201cSo a person of mixed background threatened that entire system.\u201d</p> <p>There are enormous differences between modern France and mid-century Mississippi. But they did have one thing in common: a crisis of identity.</p> <p>And for that, in Mississippi, people would die.</p> <p>Gwendolyn Mason remembers days in Biloxi when her neighbor would take her and her friends to the beach. They were small.<br></p> <p>\u201cHe was a black man, but he looked white,\u201d she said.</p> <p>At the beach he would set up a chair and read a newspaper, watching over the children. As cars passed on the beach road, drivers would lean into their horns, blaring. The neighbor would calmly say, \u201cYou never mind that. Just go ahead and play.\u201d</p> <p>As a teenager Gwendolyn watched a young doctor, Gilbert Mason \u2013 whom she would later marry \u2013 lead a series of \u201cwade-ins\u201d to protest at Biloxi\u2019s segregated beaches. He was an educated man, a visionary and a close friend of soon-to-be martyred <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medgar_Evers\">Medgar Evers</a>. Only years later, Martin Luther King Jr and other civil rights leaders would march in Alabama.</p> <p>The first wade-in drew just a few attendees. Police pushed them down the beach, toward the narrow strip for black people. Officers told them that the other 26 miles were for \u201conly the public\u201d.</p> <p>At the second wade-in, Gilbert came alone. This time police arrested him.</p> <p>Gilbert held great standing as Biloxi\u2019s only black doctor, practicing from his home. He pulled teeth, delivered babies and performed surgery for the black community. So when police arrested him, his friends took action.</p> <p>On 24 April 1960, 125 black people walked down on to the white sand and proceeded to play games, lie in the sun and gaze \u2013 like all other humans \u2013 into the vastness of the sea.</p> <p>Before long, white vigilantes showed up with clubs, chains and tire irons. Police stood aside and watched while the group attacked and beat the protesters, leaving them bloodied and broken. The melee continued throughout the weekend, and two black people died as white mobs moved through black neighborhoods.</p> <p>Eventually, in 1968, black people won the right to visit public beaches.</p> <p>Gilbert Mason also won the right to practice medicine in the local hospital, after 15 years.</p> <p>But it took all those years, his widow said, for people to accept change.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got to keep fighting,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd keep fighting. And keep fighting.\u201d</p> <p>A young black woman named Erin Brewer recently visited the Biloxi beach at the site of the wade-in. </p> <p>She hadn\u2019t heard about it before.</p> <p>She walked past the historical marker, with its brief summary, and read it. Then she read it again, and again. \u201cIt\u2019s a strange feeling,\u201d she said. \u201cI feel grateful.\u201d</p> <p>She had heard about the affair of the French Muslim women and their clothes. She held out her own long skirt, which flapped in the breeze. \u201cI\u2019m a Christian,\u201d she said. \u201cBut people should be allowed to believe what they believe. How can you change a person\u2019s beliefs by forcing them to take off their clothes? It\u2019s impossible.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Almost 1,400 patients with either breast or lung cancer died in England in 2014 within a month of being given chemotherapy, according to a study which suggested they suffered harm rather than benefited from the drug treatment.</p> <p>Those who died within 30 days accounted for a small proportion of the total number given the toxic anti-cancer drugs designed to destroy tumours. Most of the patients were given chemotherapy for palliative care, with the intention of relieving cancer symptoms rather than curing the patient.</p> <p>But, according to the authors of the study commissioned by Public Health England (PHE), \u201cpatients dying within 30 days after beginning treatment [with chemotherapy] are unlikely to have gained the survival or palliative benefits of the treatment, and in view of the side-effects sometimes caused ... are more likely to have suffered harm\u201d.</p> <p>The study, which is <a href=\"http://%20http//www.thelancet.com/journals/lanonc/article/PIIS1470-2045(16)30383-7/abstract\">published in the Lancet Oncology journal</a>, showed the deaths were spread across the country and not clustered in any one area. However, analysis of the data submitted by the hospitals revealed some had higher death rates than would be expected once the age and condition of the patient had been taken into account. All those hospital trusts have been asked to check their data and investigate whether patients were treated appropriately.</p> <p>The study is groundbreaking because it is the first time that national data has been gathered together and analysed for 30-day mortality after chemotherapy. It found that a larger proportion of patients die than in the clinical trials carried out by the drug companies. The death rate in trials of drug treatments for lung cancer was 0.8%, but in the present study it is 3%.</p> <p>\u201cTrials try to exclude high-risk patients,\u201d said Dr Jem Rashbass, cancer lead for PHE and one of the study\u2019s authors. \u201cYou are more likely to get a positive answer [about the benefit of the drug] because of the case mix.\u201d</p> <p>PHE hopes the research will enable hospitals and clinicians to look carefully at who they treat with chemotherapy and, in some cases, make better decisions. There is no suggestion of blame, most people do well on chemotherapy.</p> <p>\u201cThese are judgments,\u201d said Rashbass. \u201cMedicine is greatly informed by hindsight. No doctor tries to give medicine to their patient to kill them but sometimes that balance goes the wrong way. I don\u2019t see this as being bad practice.</p> <p>\u201cThe easiest way not to kill your patients with chemotherapy is not to give it to anyone, and that is clearly wrong.\u201d</p> <p>There were 569 breast and 720 lung cancer deaths within 30 days of those patients being given chemotherapy for palliative care. </p> <p>There were 41 breast cancer patients and 53 lung cancer patients who died after chemotherapy intended to cure them. The breast cancer patients were being treated at seven hospital trusts: Burton, Ipswich, Kettering, South Warwickshire, Dorset, Gloucestershire and Coventry and Warwickshire.</p> <p>The lung cancer patients were being treated at five trusts: Milton Keynes, South Tyneside, Torbay and South Devon, Surrey and Sussex, and the Royal Bournemouth and Christchurch.</p> <p>Most of the trusts said either that they had made mistakes in the data they sent to PHE or that the patient died of something other than their chemotherapy treatment.</p>",

  "<p>What\u2019s happening to Rudy Giuliani?</p> <p>On <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/30/rudy-giuliani-beyonce-black-lives-vmas\">Monday</a>, he slammed Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s VMA performance, calling it a \u201cshame\u201d and boasting: \u201cI saved more black lives than any of those people you saw onstage.\u201d On Tuesday, USA Today <a href=\"http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2016/08/29/hillary-clinton-donald-trump-rudy-giuliani-editorials-debates/89563064/\">published an op-ed</a> by Giuliani where he gave a veneer of mainstream media respectability to the idea that Hillary Clinton is hiding grave medical issues \u2013 despite the fact that there\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/24/hillary-clinton-health-rumors-doctor-column\">no evidence for this</a> beyond wishful thinking on the part of the alt-right. </p> <p>In the days after the 9/11 terrorist attacks on New York, Giuliani was dubbed \u201c<a href=\"http://www.history.com/topics/rudy-giuliani\">America\u2019s Mayor</a>\u201d. Now, from his fiery <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/video/national/watch-rudy-giulianis-full-speech-at-the-rnc/2016/07/18/d11411b8-4d57-11e6-bf27-405106836f96_video.html?tid=a_inl\">convention speech</a> to his specious claim that there were <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/aug/16/rudy-giuliani/aside-from-911-rudy-giuliani-wrong-about-no-terr/\">no terrorist attacks</a> in the eight years before Barack Obama\u2019s election, the former New York City mayor often seems to make pronouncements that are divorced from reality.</p> <p>But that\u2019s not new. That\u2019s Rudy Giuliani. As New Yorkers learned early on during his administration as mayor in 1990s, Giuliani has always had a penchant for bluster, for taking credit from his subordinates, and for an authoritarian single-mindedness. No wonder he\u2019s stumping for Donald Trump.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/30/rudy-giuliani-beyonce-black-lives-vmas\">Rudy Giuliani: I've 'saved more black lives' than Beyonc\u00e9</a> </p> </aside>  <p>I can\u2019t say I envy him as he tries to secure his legacy. Being America\u2019s Mayor is an impossible act to follow, and leading New York City has long been considered the \u201c<a href=\"http://www.barrypopik.com/index.php/new_york_city/entry/second_toughest_job_in_america_nyc_mayor\">second toughest job in America</a>\u201d. By implication, there\u2019s only one step up \u2013 the White House \u2013 and in 2007, Giuliani threw his hat into the presidential ring. Riding on his post-9/11 fame, Giuliani was an early favorite, but after dismal results in the early primaries, he withdrew in January 2008.</p> <p>Was his failure merely due to the fact that <a href=\"http://blogs.abcnews.com/politicalradar/2008/01/koch-on-giulian.html\">no New York City mayor</a> has ever bridged the gap from city hall to the Oval Office? Or was there something more in Giuliani\u2019s brash personality and his law-and-order mentality that couldn\u2019t make the transition to a national audience?</p> <p>Giuliani rose to national prominence when America was reeling from the 9/11 attacks. And as lawyer Ron Kuby points out in the documentary <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Giuliani-Time-Kevin-Keating/dp/B002UXFANC\">Giuliani Time</a>, in a crisis people are looking for a powerful authority figure. But what about the other eight years of his mayoralty? Most people realize that what works in a crisis isn\u2019t necessarily appropriate at other times \u2013 but that never stopped Giuliani. To him, New York had always been under attack.</p> <p>At the beginning of his first term, Giuliani gave a <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/1994/03/20/nyregion/freedom-is-about-authority-excerpts-from-giuliani-speech-on-crime.html\">chilling speech</a> in which he said: \u201cFreedom is not a concept in which people can do anything they want, be anything they can be. Freedom is about authority. Freedom is about the willingness of every single human being to cede to lawful authority a great deal of discretion about what you do.\u201d</p> <p>He proceeded to put his words into action. First, he made good on a campaign promise to clean up squeegee men \u2013 launching the so-called \u201c<a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/criticism-for-giulianis-broken-windows-theory-2014-12\">broken windows\u201d era</a> that would end up disproportionately jailing black people and other minorities. He then embraced the <a href=\"http://nymag.com/nymetro/news/anniversary/35th/n_8551/\">ideas of transit cop Jack Maple</a> and helped launch CompStat, the city\u2019s data-driven crime-fighting system. It can\u2019t be denied that crime fell \u2013 and that\u2019s how Giuliani is today able to claim he saved \u201cmore black lives\u201d than Beyonc\u00e9. <br></p> <p>But despite CompStat\u2019s real successes, it also can\u2019t be denied that crime was already falling when he took office \u2013 and it was happening nationwide. Later, when New York police commissioner William Bratton landed on the cover of Time magazine as New York\u2019s top crime fighter, <a href=\"http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/hamill-bratton-sounds-de-blasio-policing-policies-article-1.1489351\">Giuliani pushed him out</a> for taking too much credit. </p> <p>There were other clear signs of paranoia during the Giuliani years. Long before the World Trade Center attacks, the front steps of city hall \u2013 a place for public gatherings and protest \u2013 were <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2000/04/21/nyregion/giuliani-defends-decision-over-access-to-city-hall.html\">sealed off by police barricades</a> that remain in place today. The administration claimed it was a security measure; the mayor\u2019s detractors felt certain it was done to limit access and stifle free speech. <br></p> <p>Giuliani\u2019s city hall was also the subject of constant lawsuits. Some were filed by <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/1998/12/22/nyregion/court-tells-giuliani-to-release-budget-data.html\">other city agencies</a> to which he wouldn\u2019t release necessary data; others were brought by individuals whose whose constitutional rights were being violated by the city. Many of those lawsuits <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2004/12/24/nyregion/a-legacy-of-giuliani-years-damage-suits-against-city.html\">were still being settled</a> \u2013 for millions of dollars \u2013 years into the administration of Mike Bloomberg, Giuliani\u2019s successor.</p> <p>In short, Rudy Giuliani wasn\u2019t a great mayor, or even a good one. But on one terrible day, he was a strong, decisive one. He could have faded quietly into history, remembered as the man who kept the city together in its hour of need. Instead, by becoming Donald Trump\u2019s attack dog, the former mayor has instead ensured that his larger-than-life ego and his combative abrasiveness \u2013 the qualities New Yorkers remember all too well, and which kept him from the presidency \u2013 will ultimately define his legacy.</p>",
  "<p>\u201cI just say whatever dumb stuff comes into my head, and most of it is disgusting and horrible,\u201d Amy Schumer muses happily, midway through her set. This, of course, is a lie: while Schumer still likes to project an image of herself as a pottymouth who\u2019s just winging it, you don\u2019t become one of the biggest standups in the world by the age of 35 without working your butt off.</p> <p>Schumer keeps her 90-minute show under deceptively tight control, sneaking frequent peeks at her notes while affecting to stroll casually through her mental landscape, which spans all of Americana from the Kardashians to an improbably hilarious section on gun control \u2013 or lack of it \u2013 in the US.<br></p> <p>\u201cSomeone on the suspected terrorist list can buy a gun. So we\u2019re like, \u2018Get the hell out of our country! But before you do, would you like to buy a gun?\u2019\u201d she says, touching on a subject that has become a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/oct/26/amy-schumer-renews-call-stricter-gun-control\">cause for Schumer</a> ever since a gunman attacked an audience at a screening of her film, Trainwreck, last summer, killing two young women.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2016/aug/27/amy-schumer-not-trying-be-likable\">Amy Schumer: \u2018I'm not trying to be likable\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <p>This is Schumer\u2019s first international tour since <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/trainwreck\">Trainwreck</a>, which pushed her out of the category of \u201csuccessful comedian\u201d and into the \u201cbona fide A-list celebrity\u201d golden circle. This shift has not always seemed comfortable for her: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2016/aug/27/amy-schumer-not-trying-be-likable\">in interviews</a> she has become increasingly suspicious and monosyllabic and in her forthcoming book, <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.vogue.com/13467201/amy-schumer-the-girl-with-the-lower-back-tattoo-review/\">The Girl With the Lower Back Tattoo</a>, she appears unsure how to reconcile her celebrity status with her everygirl image. </p> <p>But on stage, which she has always said is where she feels happiest, there are no such troubles. Amid her usual favourite subjects \u2013 sex, women\u2019s neuroses and neuroses about women \u2013 she achieves what few have done before her and makes her tales of newfound fame genuinely funny and interesting. Her riff on what it feels like when near-naked photos of you go viral and you don\u2019t have a celebrity-sized body is done with a light touch, while still making a sharp jab; and her anecdote about her encounter with the American broadcaster Katie Couric made me double over with laughter. While many of the stories she tells are straight out of her book, she is more sure-footed with them on stage and has a better control of the tone.</p> <p>Yet it is hard not to wish Schumer would relax some of her control. Some anecdotes, while amusing, don\u2019t really go anywhere, seemingly said by rote just because they are on her setlist. By contrast, she sparks to life when dealing with a heckler, shooting back whipsmart retorts without pausing for breath. She should trust herself more and not stick quite so rigidly to the plan.</p> <p>It will be interesting to see how long Schumer can pull off this trick: affecting normality while hanging out with Hillary Clinton and earning $8m book advances. Going by those who have tried before her, the safe bet is not that long. She is already outgrowing her persona as the chaotic mess who happily blacks out on sleeping pills and wine, to the disgust of her boyfriend \u2013 and she knows it. That shtick is too small for her huge celebrity presence. But for now, at least on stage, she is still acing it. </p> <ul> <li>At the O2 <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.amyschumer.com/tour\">Apollo Manchester</a> on 3 September.

He may face more vocal criticism from them now their primary battles are over.</p> <p>McCain in particular was seen as vulnerable to a populist challenge by Kelli Ward in Arizona, but was comfortably ahead by 55 to 35 percentage points when the Republican primary result was called shortly before 9pm local time. </p> <p>Rubio launched his political comeback earlier on Tuesday night with a decisive victory in the Florida primary setting up a more winnable battle with Democrats, one that could determine control of the US Senate in November. </p> <p> Despite announcing his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jun/22/marco-rubio-re-election-florida-senate-seat\">decision to seek re-election</a> only two months ago, the freshman senator saw off a challenge from Trump-supporting real estate developer Carlos Beruff to win the Republican nomination by a comfortable 72 percentage points to 18.</p> <p> Previously Rubio had announced his retirement from politics after losing his home state to Trump by some 20 points in the presidential primary election. He was persuaded to change his mind as Republican leaders in Washington sensed that the Senate race in the state could prove pivotal.</p> <p> \u201cThis has been an unusual road back here with you tonight. As you know, after my race ended in March for the presidency I was prepared to become a private citizen,\u201d Rubio told supporters after the result. \u201cBut I just couldn\u2019t be at peace with the idea that we were going to not just potentially lose the Senate seat but lose the balance of power in the Senate at this critical moment in our nation\u2019s history.\u201d </p> <p> The Associated Press also projected that congressman Murphy had won the Democratic primary in the state by a margin of 59 to 18 percentage points.</p> <p> It sets up a tight race with Rubio in November, who is now narrow favorite to hold the state and could prevent Democrats netting the four seats nationwide they may need to swing control of the US Senate.</p> <p> Murphy saw off a lackluster challenge from Grayson, who was badly damaged by <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2016/07/alan-grayson-wife-florida-226090\">domestic abuse allegations</a> and <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2016/07/alan-grayson-politico-reporter-226219\">reacted angrily</a> to inquiries into his background.</p> <p> It was a disappointing night overall for the progressive wing of the Democratic party, which had also hoped to unseat former Democratic National Committee chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz after she was seen to take sides against Bernie Sanders in the presidential race.</p> <p> Sanders endorsed anti-establishment candidate Tim Canova in the 23rd House district around Miami, but he lost to Wasserman Schulz by nearly 14 percentage points. </p> <p> Canova, who <a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/08/canova-revolution-bernie-sanders-debbie-wasserman-schultz/497807/\">did not receive much direct support from Sanders</a>, hinted at a possible concession as soon as the polls closed, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Tim_Canova/status/770759017702580225\">telling supporters</a>: \u201cNo matter what happens we should all be proud of what we\u2019ve accomplished in a short period of time.\u201d </p> <p> In another Florida House primary, the incumbent Democratic congresswoman Corrine Brown lost the party nomination following an indictment on fraud charges.</p> <p>But it is Rubio\u2019s strong comeback against anti-establishment forces within the Republican party that is likely to be the most memorable feature of the Florida primary.</p> <p> Beruff, a real estate developer who self-funded the campaign in a similar vein to Trump, had attacked Rubio for missing votes during his presidential campaign, not being anti-immigration enough and failing to wholeheartedly support Trump as the party\u2019s eventual nominee.</p> <p>Similarly, Ward blasted McCain for being soft on immigration and too old to seek his sixth term as senator of the increasingly diverse state.</p> <p>In Arizona the other big local news was the victory of controversial immigration control champion Sheriff Joe Arpaio in his primary.</p>",

It\u2019s not a life-shatteringly interesting question, but something I felt I needed to know to consider how long I could afford to be at home with my newborn. Instead of clarification I received a sharp email instructing me that maternity leave was intended to be for \u201crecuperating from childbirth and spending time with my baby\u201d. It was not a way of greedily storing up holiday. Chastened and naive, I didn\u2019t ask again. Those bank holidays I was indeed entitled to disappeared into the ether, and I didn\u2019t go back to that job.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2016/aug/21/rise-in-women-facing-discrimination-on-taking-maternity-leave\">Rise in women facing discrimination on taking maternity leave</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Since then, as chief executive of the human rights in childbirth charity <a href=\"http://www.birthrights.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Birthrights</a>, I\u2019ve worked with many women facing a range of violations during or due to pregnancy and childbirth, and I know how lucky I am. In my case the stakes were pretty low. I could just about afford not to battle but could have battled if necessary. And when I realised that my much-loved job wouldn\u2019t accommodate work life and family life I was able to do something else.</p> <p>For others maternity discrimination is more than an inconvenience \u2013 it is a matter of life and death, of basic survival versus thriving. The committee estimates that 53,000 women each year are being discouraged from attending antenatal appointments by their employers, despite permanent employees having the right to time off for these crucial check-ups. I\u2019ve seen the result of this while sitting in hospital waiting rooms \u2013 sometimes for hours \u2013 with women attending vital appointments for their high-risk pregnancies. As the minutes tick past at the overstretched unit, their slots get pushed back later and later. They weigh up upsetting their employer against missing a key check-up. It\u2019s a choice between yours and your baby\u2019s physical safety now, and knowing you\u2019ll have a job to go back to and can put food on the table when that bump is a squawking toddler demanding three meals a day.</p> <p>Banging the drum for the rights of pregnant women is often portrayed as an occupation for the privileged. Defending women\u2019s rights to choose how and where they give birth or insisting that employers make careers possible for working mothers has cleverly been placed in a box marked \u201centitled\u201d. Hiding behind that label is a truth that although these issues affect all women (whether they plan to have children or not), it is those at the vulnerable end of the spectrum who often face the most profound consequences of having a uterus and daring to take it to work.</p> <p>Those with the fewest legal protections are casual, agency and zero-hours contract workers \u2013 an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/mar/09/uk-workers-on-zero-hours-contracts-rises-above-800000\" title=\"\">expanding group in recent years</a> due a scarcity of permanent jobs.

The media continues to report this as simply an economic problem and out come the arguments about the difficulties maternity rights pose for small business or the ideological discussions about whether women could or should \u201chave it all\u201d.</p> <p>Four out of five women experience pregnancy and, whether we intend to use it or not, our capacity to become pregnant sits at the root of every woman\u2019s unequal treatment in society. This is not a discussion that needs to stay in the boardroom. Without progress in pregnancy and childbirth we cannot make enough progress in women\u2019s broader rights. And those made more vulnerable because of their precarious low-paid, low-status jobs will continue to find pregnancy a gateway to the food bank.</p> <p>The report criticises the Equalities and Human Rights Commission for its belief that maternity discrimination is simply an issue of misinformation that can be corrected with a few well-placed facts. The ECHR\u2019s spokesperson asserts this is \u201cnot bigger picture stuff\u201d, but I (like the select committee) strongly disagree. In the broader context of reproductive rights, where the most vulnerable in society are punished at every level with life-altering consequences, maternity discrimination cannot be anything but the very biggest of big pictures.</p> <p><em>\u2022 </em><a href=\"http://www.pinterandmartin.com/why-human-rights-in-childbirth-matter.html\" title=\"\"><em>Why Human Rights in Childbirth Matter</em></a><em> by Rebecca Schiller is published on 15 September</em></p>",

At almost every rally, Trump pledges that he will \u201cbuild a wall and make Mexico pay for it\u201d, but he has rarely gone into more detail. </p> <p>But, facing a general election where he has major deficits in the polls and is reviled by Latino voters, the Republican nominee has begun what he called a rhetorical \u201csoftening\u201d in recent weeks, raising questions about whether he was ever sincere in his hardline stance. </p> <p>In the past week and a half, Trump <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/24/donald-trump-immigration-reform-sean-hannity-fox-news\">seemingly endorsed a path to legal status for</a> undocumented immigrants in an interview with Fox News\u2019s Sean Hannity, only to <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2016/08/25/politics/trump-no-legal-status-for-undocumented-immigrants/\">reverse himself</a> in an interview with CNN\u2019s Anderson Cooper. The back and forth prompted conservative talk radio show host Rush Limbaugh <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2016/aug/30/donald-trump-hillary-clinton-hacking-threat-election-live?page=with:block-57c5aa4be4b0df5f040dbd69#block-57c5aa4be4b0df5f040dbd69\">to admit</a>, \u201cI never took him seriously\u201d on immigration. Further, he announced late on Tuesday night that he would <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/31/donald-trump-mexico-president-nieto\">meet the Mexican president, Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto</a> before the speech on Wednesday to discuss immigration.</p> <p>The ongoing furor has raised the stakes around Trump\u2019s speech and stoked outrage about an apparent flip-flop. In <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/27/donald-trump-immigration-policy-deportation\">a speech in Iowa</a> on Saturday, Trump spoke about details from his August 2015 plan that had gone almost unmentioned since, including the implementation of E-Verify (an online system that allows businesses to screen employees\u2019 work eligibility) nationwide as well as an exit-entry tracking system to prevent visa overstays. However, Trump dismissed the question of what to do with the 11 million illegal immigrants in the country, instead blaming the media: \u201cIn recent days, the media \u2013 as it usually does \u2013 has missed the whole point on immigration,\u201d he said. \u201cAll the media wants to talk about is the 11 million or more people here illegally.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/28/donald-trump-immigration-plan-deportation-mike-pence\">Trump surrogates: Republican's position on immigration has not changed</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Mark Krikorian, a leading immigration hawk and head of the Center for Immigration Studies, bemoaned the fact that Trump has spent a \u201cweek and a half meandering\u201d on immigration. Krikorian, who has met with Trump on the issue, said this \u201cwas especially absurd given that it\u2019s a core, key issue. He\u2019s running as \u2018Mr Immigration Control\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>Krikorian told the Guardian he thought that Trump can only end up in the place where he actually started, \u201cfocusing on enforcement tools like E-Verify and tracking for visa holders\u201d.</p> <p>The vocal immigration hawk thought \u201cthe question of what happens to illegal immigrants is secondary; [the] primary question is how we stop another 12 million people from coming here.\u201d He noted that Trump was on record saying that some form of \u201camnesty\u201d would always happen but that \u201ca politician has no business talking like that and that\u2019s the one most important thing that I am looking to not see, is some kind of guarantee or commitment of amnesty.\u201d But he said that he was far less concerned about the wall, which \u201cas a policy matter is not that important\u201d.</p> <p>In the meantime, those on the right worried about a rhetorical softening did find some comfort from an interview that Trump\u2019s son, Donald Jr, gave to CNN on Tuesday, in which he said that his father\u2019s stance on undocumented immigrants was still the same and that all 11 million had to leave the country. But as longtime Trump adviser Roger Stone once said: \u201cNo one speaks for Donald Trump but Donald Trump.\u201d</p> <p>The Republican nominee is scheduled to give his immigration speech at 6pm local time at the Phoenix Convention Center on Wednesday. </p>",
  "<p>The seasons of a love affair are played out beguilingly in this wonderfully sweet, sad, smart new movie from Damien Chazelle \u2013 the director of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/jan/15/whiplash-review\">Whiplash</a> \u2013 and the Venice film festival could not have wished for a bigger sugar rush to start the proceedings. It\u2019s an unapologetically romantic homage to classic movie musicals, splashing its poster-paint energy and dream-chasing optimism on the screen. With no little audacity, La La Land seeks its own place somewhere on a continuum between <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/singin-in-the-rain\">Singin\u2019 in the Rain</a> and Woody Allen\u2019s Everyone Says I Love You, with a hint of Alan Parker\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2009/sep/27/fame-performing-arts-kelsey-grammer\">Fame</a> for the opening sequence, in which a bunch of young kids with big dreams, symbolically stuck in a traffic jam on the freeway leading to Los Angeles, get out of their cars and stage a big dance number.</p> <p>To be honest, this is where an audience might find its tolerance for this picture\u2019s unironic bounce tested, coming as it does right at the top of the show. It takes a little while to get acclimatised, and for the first five minutes, the showtune feel to the musical score might make you feel you\u2019re watching a Broadway adaptation. But very soon I was utterly absorbed by this movie\u2019s simple storytelling verve and the terrific lead performances from Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone who are both excellent \u2013 particularly Stone, who has never been better, her huge doe eyes radiating wit and intelligence when they\u2019re not filling with tears. Gosling, for his part, has a nice line in sardonic dismissal to conceal how hurt he is or how in love he is.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/video/2017/jan/13/ryan-gosling-emma-stone-la-la-land-video-interview\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/5kqdk\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"3070190\"            data-video-name=\"Ryan Gosling on La La Land: 'The world is quick to shame you for trying' \u2013 video interview\"            data-video-provider=\"Other\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-5878c0dce4b0c0afac920704\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2017/01/13/170113LaLaLandJunket2_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2017/01/13/170113LaLaLandJunket2_WebM.webm\"/><source src=\"https://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=12198430&amp;format=video/m3u8\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/video/2017/jan/13/ryan-gosling-emma-stone-la-la-land-video-interview\">Ryan Gosling on La La Land: \u2018The world is quick to shame you for trying\u2019</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>The two of them get a meet cute in the traffic jam. Stone is Mia, a wannabe movie star like pretty much everyone else, and while waiting, she is distractedly going through her pages for an audition she has later in the day. Chazelle, incidentally, creates a mischievous reveal in which we are later struck by the dull listless way she runs the lines to herself, and the passionate way she sells them later to the producer. I wonder if the director was influenced by Naomi Watts\u2019s actress in that other La-La-Land extravaganza: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/mulholland-drive\">Mulholland Drive</a>, by David Lynch.</p> <p>But she doesn\u2019t notice the cars ahead starting, and holds up the driver behind her: a disagreeable guy in a macho convertible, who pulls belligerently round to overtake, scowling at Mia and receiving the finger in return. This is Seb, played by Gosling, a pianist and jazz evangelist who is living a scuzzy apartment in the city.</p> <p>A little like Mr Fletcher, the terrifying jazz teacher played by JK Simmons in Chazelle\u2019s Whiplash, Seb is a purist and an uncompromiser, a difficult guy to get to know or like. He is lonely and unhappy, claiming to his exasperated sister (Rosemarie DeWitt) that he is just playing rope-a-dope with life and fate, waiting for them to wear themselves out beating him, after which he will come storming back. Seb is fired from a restaurant, where the manager (a cameo for Simmons) is enraged by his tendency to favour brilliant free-jazz improvisations instead of the tinkling background music he gets paid for. But it is here, again, that Seb meets Mia, and then again at a party, where Seb has humiliatingly got a gig playing synth in an 80s-style band. It is fate.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/video/2016/sep/01/la-la-land-trailer-ryan-gosling-emma-stone-star-musical-movie-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/5xy9z\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2692464\"            data-video-name=\"La La Land trailer: Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone star in musical movie \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"Lionsgate Films UK\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-57c7dc97e4b04fe839bc541d\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/09/01/160901lalaland_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/09/01/160901lalaland.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/09/01/160901lalaland_WebM.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/video/2016/sep/01/la-la-land-trailer-ryan-gosling-emma-stone-star-musical-movie-video\">Watch the La La Land trailer</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>Winter turns to spring and then to summer, and their affair begins to take off: Mia encourages Seb to find a way to open the jazz club he dreams of, but to prove to her he\u2019s not a flake, he takes a regular gig playing the piano in a jazz-rock band led by an old frenemy of his. Suppressing his fears that he is selling out, Seb in his turn encourages Mia to write her one-woman show \u2013 that toe curling staple of the needy actress. But there is trouble in store: having been careless in what they wished for, Mia and Seb find that success and careers are to come between them. There is a brilliant scene in which a surprise supper Seb has cooked for Mia descends into a painful row as they quarrel about how their lives are panning out.</p> <p>Chazelle creates musical numbers for the pair of them, and Gosling and Stone carry these off with delicacy and charm, despite or because of the fact that they are not real singers. The director must surely have considered the possibility of casting, say, Anna Kendrick in the role of Mia, who would undoubtedly have given the musical aspect some real punch. But Stone fits the part beautifully: something in the hesitancy and even frailty of her singing voice is just right. Both actors are also very accomplished dancers within a shrewdly limited range. </p> <p>La La Land is such a happy, sweet-natured movie \u2013 something to give you a vitamin-D boost of sunshine.</p>",
  "<p>A precipitous drop in the US <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/teenage-pregnancy\">teenage pregnancy</a> rate to record lows was driven by improved use of contraception, a <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.jahonline.org/article/S1054-139X(16)30172-0/fulltext#sec4\">new analysis</a> from the Guttmacher Institute found.</p> <p>\u201cThere was no significant change in adolescent sexual activity during this time period,\u201d Dr Laura Lindberg, a principal research scientist with the Guttmacher Institute and the paper\u2019s lead author, said in <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.guttmacher.org/news-release/2016/declines-teen-pregnancy-risk-entirely-driven-improved-contraceptive-use\">a statement</a>. \u201cRather, our new data suggest that recent declines in teens\u2019 risk of pregnancy \u2013 and in their pregnancy rates \u2013 are driven by increased contraceptive use.\u201d </p> <p>Linberg and her co-authors found that while teenage girls\u2019 sexual activity remained constant from 2007 to 2012, the percentage of sexually active teens who used at least one type of birth control the last time they had sex increased significantly, rising from 78% to 86%.</p> <p>The researchers found the use of all \u201chighly effective methods\u201d, like the birth control pill or IUD, increased from 2007 to 2009. There was a marginal significant increase in the use of the IUD or implant from 2007 to 2009 and in use of the pill overall. There were non-significant increases in condom use and withdrawal, while use of the ring or patch declined significantly over the 2007 to 2012 period.</p> <p>The changes in contraceptive use resulted in a 28% decline in pregnancy risk index from 2007 to 2012. Not only did improvements in contraceptive use drive that entire decline, but they were also responsible for neutralizing a 6% rise in risk over the same period due to increased sexual activity among teens. The pregnancy risk index is a calculation that \u201csummarizes the risk of pregnancy among all adolescent women, estimating the influence of both changes in the level of recent sexual activity and changes in the level of contraceptive risk\u201d, according to the study.</p> <p>In April, the Guttmacher Institute reported that the national pregnancy rate <a href=\"https://www.guttmacher.org/news-release/2016/us-teen-pregnancy-birth-and-abortion-rates-reach-lowest-levels-almost-four-decades\">declined 23%</a><em> </em>from 2008 to 2011 for women aged 15 to 19, falling from a rate of 68.2 pregnancies per 1,000 women to 52.4. That means about 5% of teens became pregnant in 2011. It was the \u201clowest rate observed in the last four decades\u201d, they said, with declines across all 50 states and racial and ethnic groups, though some disparities remained. In 2011, they found a rate of 31.3 births per 1,000 teen women, down from 40.2 in 2008, and 13.5 abortions per 1,000 teen women, down from 18.1 in 2008.</p> <p>The new study used data from the National Survey of Family Growth, a survey conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, on sexual activity, contraceptive use and contraceptive failures to estimate the pregnancy risk index for the years 2007, 2009 and 2012. </p> <p>The authors noted it was important to ensure teenagers\u2019 \u201caccess to comprehensive sexuality education that provides medically accurate information about contraception\u201d. They wrote that the percentage of adolescents \u201cwho report receiving formal instruction about birth control has declined, while the share receiving only abstinence instruction has increased\u201d. The American Academy of Pediatricians <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/jul/18/aap-report-guidelines-sex-education-abstinence\">recently urged</a> doctors to fill in the gaps of sexual health education with their patients. They noted that abstinence-heavy education is a concern for doctors when it comes to reducing sexually transmitted infections and unintended pregnancies, as those programs can exclude information about contraceptives.</p> <p>The internet, the authors suggested, can offer new opportunities for teenagers looking for information on sexual health, and recommend further research to examine that hypothesis. A <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/jun/23/broadband-falling-teenage-pregnancy-rates-research-internet\">separate study</a> from last year found a correlation between decline in transmission of sexually transmitted infections and access to high-speed internet.</p> <p>\u201cPolicy discussions should focus on supporting teen contraceptive use generally, including ensuring access to a full range of contraceptive education, counseling and methods,\u201d Heather Boonstra, the Guttmacher Institute\u2019s director of public policy, said in the release.</p> <p>The Guttmacher Institute\u2019s study used data up until 2012, however, more recent data from the CDC\u2019s Youth Risk Behavior Survey \u201cshows sharp declines in sexual activity among high school students from 2013 to 2015 \u2013 after a long plateau from 2001 to 2013\u201d, the authors wrote. \u201cAt this point, it is unclear whether these new data represent a new trend or are the result of other factors,\u201d the authors wrote. </p> <p>Another analysis from earlier this month found that millennials are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/aug/02/less-sex-please-were-millennials-study\">having less sex</a> than those in previous generations. </p>",
  "<p>When Margaret Thatcher said there was no such thing as society, she perhaps envisaged Essex Lane Estate, known to its residents as The Devil: \u201cA drop-in centre for criminals, drop-outs and people who were too stoned or too ill to have anywhere else to go.\u201d It isn\u2019t just law and order that have broken down in Dreda Say Mitchell\u2019s fictitious concrete jungle, it\u2019s the bonds of family, faith and ideology that might have held a community together. That this story largely focuses on the lives of its female residents is because there are precious few males to be found.</p> <p>The opening novel of a trilogy, <em>Blood Sister</em> takes place over the decade between 1993 and 2003 that saw the end of 18 years of Tory rule and the triumphant emergence of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/series/looking-back-on-new-labour\">New Labour</a>. It tells the intertwining histories of white working-class sisters Jen and Tiffany Miller, their mother, Babs, and a mixed-race woman who calls herself Mizz Dee, the novel\u2019s central enigma.</p> <p>Teenage Jen and Tiffany are rivals \u2013 the former at pains to work her way out of The Devil via a college course in fashion design; the latter a tearaway who spends her hours smoking dandelions \u2013 a substitute for weed \u2013 in the graveyard. Tiffany has other plans for escaping the boredom of her existence: she has started running errands for the local gangster. She thinks she has all the smarts it will take to survive, starting with blagging a trip up west with her furiously protesting sister.</p> <p>On this fateful evening, Tiffany, \u201cswaggering Liam Gallagher-style\u201d, accompanies the faux-Dior-clad Jen into Soho. The bickering Millers soon part, both taking turns into parallel nocturnal portals that will shape their futures irrevocably: Jen into an upmarket nightclub on the arm of flash geezer Nuts; Tiffany shinning through the gents\u2019 window into a gay bar. Neither realises what these two seemingly antithetical places share \u2013 secrets that bind their past to their futures.</p> <p><em>Blood Sister</em> is similar in scope and tone to the epic criminal family sagas of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/oct/28/martina-cole-queen-of-crime\">Martina Cole</a>, into whose Essex badlands the action moves in the latter half of the tale. But it\u2019s also part of an East Side Story that has been told by second-generation immigrants such as Mitchell, herself the daughter of Jamaicans, throughout the 20th century, as in the fictions of Arthur La Bern, Simon Blumenfeld and Alexander Baron which explored the tenements, pubs and dosshouses of these same streets. They dealt in similar soap opera-style narratives, with multiple perspectives and plotlines, all rendered in the slang that is the furiously inventive speciality of the region. Mitchell adds her own contributions to this tradition \u2013 man-donna (gay man), Class-A extras (cocaine), BS merchant (unreliable witness), looby-loos (not quite the full shilling), ug-mug (unatttractive) and geezer bird (lesbian).</p> <p>Those writers shared the same avowed aim as Mitchell: to tell the story of London through marginalised voices. They also described lives of extreme poverty and shocking violence. Back then, though, there was always an outside force that could unite people \u2013 be it religion, the library or leftwing politics. All three are conspicuously absent from this world, except in tiny, heartbreaking glimmers of flashback. Despite the massive Labour victory midway through <em>Blood Sister</em>\u2019s span, there are no reds in The Devil.</p> <p>The other difference is that these earlier novelists were men. In Mitchell\u2019s female-dominated world, gender roles reverse. Women mete out violence and pimp their daughters. Childhood dreams dissolve into the drudge of shelf-stacking, echoing the sweatshops of an earlier age. Society is atomised and tenderness is a weakness.

  "<p>What are we to make of the news that social care providers have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/aug/30/fears-over-minimum-wage-increase-in-social-care-industry\">seemingly taken the \u201cnational living wage\u201d in their stride</a>? Despite the dire warnings that it would be unaffordable, they appear not only to have absorbed it, but to have gone way beyond its requirements.</p> <p>According to the respected <a href=\"http://www.resolutionfoundation.org/\">Resolution Foundation</a> thinktank, which has analysed pay figures for more than 80,000 workers courtesy of the <a href=\"http://www.skillsforcare.org.uk/NMDS-SC-intelligence/NMDS-SC-and-intelligence.aspx\">national minimum dataset for social care</a>, introduction of the new minimum wage of \u00a37.20 an hour for adults aged 25 or over has had \u201ca large, positive impact on pay in social care \u2026 with no evidence of hours being cut to foot the bill\u201d.<br></p> <p>Not only have more than half the 1.6 million social care workers in England benefited directly from the new minimum, but a remarkable 83% of those under 25 are also being paid \u00a37.20, and the overall pay bill for the sector has risen 6.9% at a stroke \u2013 more than twice the increase that was needed simply to comply with the wage law.<br></p> <p>At first sight, the findings are baffling. Care companies, and charities providing services, continue to complain that they <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/social-care-network/2016/aug/30/company-handing-homecare-contracts-back-to-councils\">cannot make a viable margin</a> on the prices being paid for contracts by many local councils. Yet they have voluntarily incurred significant extra pay costs. <br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/careers/2016/apr/01/what-difference-will-the-national-living-wage-have-on-social-care-workers\">What difference will the national living wage have on social care workers?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>As the Resolution Foundation says: \u201cHow providers have managed to behave in this way in the face of pressures on budgets is an important question for further research.\u201d<br></p> <p>There are some probable answers. First, the <a href=\"http://www.skillsforcare.org.uk/NMDS-SC-intelligence/NMDS-SC/Workforce-data-and-publications/State-of-the-adult-social-care-sector.aspx\">social care workforce</a> is relatively mature: just 11% are under 25, making it not too costly and certainly less trouble administratively to pay the \u00a37.20 to all. By comparison, says the foundation, more than one in three workers in some other low-pay sectors, such as hospitality, is under 25.<br></p> <p>Second, many social care employers will have felt they needed to maintain pay differentials in their workforces. Giving an average 9.2% rise to workers who were previously paid less than \u00a37.20, without also giving a chunky increase to those on grades above them, would have reduced the incentive for staff to progress and take on further responsibilities.<br></p> <p>Third, and most important, many \u2013 but not all \u2013 care providers received an increase in contract prices in April to help them meet the costs of the new minumum wage, often the first such uplift for several years.<br></p> <p>According to the <a href=\"https://www.adass.org.uk/home/\">Association of Directors of Adult Social Services</a>, 82% of English councils raised prices, 46% by more than 3%. One in three councils increased prices for homecare contracts by more than 5%. This came after almost all councils added the government\u2019s optional 2% social care precept to council tax bills.<br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/social-care-network/2016/aug/30/company-handing-homecare-contracts-back-to-councils\">Why my company is handing homecare contracts back to councils</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The picture, then, is encouraging. While social care remains a distressingly low-paid job, it is today almost 7% better paid than it was on 31 March. That can only be good for recruitment and retention of workers.</p> <p>Whether the sector can sustain this upward trajectory is another matter: as the Resolution Foundation warns, paying the \u00a37.20 and meeting further promised increases in the national minimum to about \u00a39 an hour by 2020 will add a total \u00a32.3bn to wage costs in social care.</p> <p>More than ever, the sector needs to get its act together to campaign effectively for a sustainable, long-term funding settlement. A key plank of such a campaign must be transparency and honesty by care providers about costs \u2013 and profits.</p> <p>What has happened with the \u201cnational living wage\u201d will leave some people feeling that providers were crying wolf about the consequences.

The PM added that as we embark on those discussions, we should consider what is going to work best for the UK and what is going to work for the European Union, rather than necessarily pursuing an existing model.\u201d</p> <p>May also promised that as long as the UK remained in the EU it would play a \u201cfull role, live up to our obligations and remain a strong supporter of free trade\u201d.</p>",

However, politics in August was active enough for the three senior Brexit ministers (Boris Johnson, Liam Fox and David Davis) to be seen quarrelling \u2013 not just with remainers, but <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/aug/14/liam-fox-attempt-wrest-control-foreign-office-duties-boris-johnson\" title=\"\">among themselves</a> \u2013 for Brexiteers to argue on the basis of short-term economic figures that the <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3759989/Another-boost-Brexit-latest-figures-EU-vote-no-impact-economic-growth.html\" title=\"\">economic harm from Brexit was exaggerated</a>, and for a host of interest groups to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/aug/30/pro-eu-group-of-mps-challenge-theresa-may-to-protect-employment-rights\" title=\"\">lobby for their particular cause</a> (from the City, via science and technology to academia).

So far all that appears to have been decided is this. The UK will move to leave the European Union; \u201cBrexit means Brexit\u201d, as Theresa May has said. A second referendum on the terms negotiated \u2013 as per <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/aug/24/owen-smith-labour-should-continue-to-fight-brexit\" title=\"\">Labour\u2019s Owen Smith</a> and many others \u2013 will not happen so long as May is prime minister.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Two months on, the choice remains as stark as it was in June</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Other points, however confidently articulated, seem less certain. The prime minister has the authority to invoke article 50 to trigger the leaving process \u2013 but MPs will apparently have a role. There will be no hurry to start the process, but no dallying either. There <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/brexit-eu-second-referendum-theresa-may-rules-out-general-election-a7216406.html\" title=\"\">will be no early election</a> \u2013 oh, won\u2019t there?

Will they have the right to stay? They probably will, but no one wants to say so lest it encourages a wave of new arrivals.</p> <p>This will presumably be broached at today\u2019s meeting, but it is a detail beside the big questions that need urgent answers. One \u2013 even at this relatively early stage \u2013 is of May\u2019s own making. The potentially destructive dispute about demarcation and precedence that broke out between Fox and others is a product of the departmental structure May has devised. The Brexit campaign that dissolved so spectacularly in the shock of victory has to reconnect with its supporters and get back to the basic premise of \u201ctaking back control\u201d.</p> <p>The second \u2013 for all that ministers have been asked to accentuate the positive and suggest how Brexit can benefit their particular department \u2013 is the question that lurked beneath the whole campaign: single market versus curbs on EU migration. All the argument over the summer on this side of the Channel has been about negotiating as much single market as possible, while limiting free movement just enough to satisfy the leave voters. The difficulty here is that the EU insists that the two are indivisible and linguistic nuance is probably not what many leave voters had in mind.</p> <p>Two months on, the choice remains as stark as it was in June. Oh, to be a fly on the Chequers wall.</p>",

Goal allowed, and France went through, although not before Brazil captain Edinho was booked for protesting against it being allowed. </p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYI8AjhYZew\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"345\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/PYI8AjhYZew?start=282&wmode=opaque&feature=oembed&start=282\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>But was he right to protest? Well, at the time \u2026 perhaps, but now, not so much. <a href=\"http://www.thefa.com/football-rules-governance/laws/football-11-11/law-14---the-penalty-kick#Y4JjtZcvIPIc9oZp.99\">The Laws of the game state</a> that a penalty is \u201ccompleted when the ball stops moving, goes out of play or the referee stops play for any infringement of the Laws\u201d. But of course the penalty shootout is an entirely different beast, and back then there was no specific provision in the laws for this sort of scenario.</p> <p>That was rectified in 1987, when a clarification was made basically stating that if the referee believed the motion of the ball was largely caused by the force of the initial kick, then the goal should be awarded. So the ball can hit the post, bar or goalkeeper any number of times and it will be permitted as a goal. Theoretically a case where the goal wouldn\u2019t be allowed is if the keeper made a save, then threw the ball up in the air and it then went over the line, because the force propelling it wasn\u2019t down to the initial kick. Clear? Cool.</p> <h2><strong>THE WHOLE WORLD IN A TEAM (2)</strong></h2> <p><strong>Last week we took nominations for teams that have featured players from all six confederations, and Chris Hinds has a small correction.</strong></p> <p>\u201cI just wanted to add that, for the Blackburn Rovers team of 2007-2008, they actually had a player from each confederation. It seems you left out Brett Emerton of Australia, who has nation had recently joined the Asian Confederation following the 2006 World Cup. As a result, Blackburn had players from all six confederations.\u201d</p> <p>So there. Meanwhile Phil Horton has a related answer and possibly a fresh question all wrapped into one. That, friends, is efficiency.</p> <p>\u201cI know this isn\u2019t really answering your question,\u201d he writes, \u201cbut I remember a cup tie in which Liverpool started with 11 players from 11 countries.</p> <p><strong>Yeovil v Liverpool, 4th Jan 2004:</strong> Dudek, Biscan, Henchoz, Hyypia, Riise, Diouf, Murphy, Hamann, Smicer, Kewell, Sinama Pongolle</p> <p>Or...</p> <p>A Pole, a Croation, a Swiss, a Finn, a Norweigian, a Senegalese, a Scouser, a German, a Czech, an Aussie and a Frenchman.</p> <p>Was this the first instance of its type and or has it ever been repeated? Or bettered? The BBC website records that the two Liverpool subs used were both French, while the Malian, \u2018Bambi\u2019 Traore, stayed on the bench.</p> <h2>BETTER THE DEVIL YOU KNOW</h2> <p><strong>\u201cI was chatting in work to a colleague about Jos\u00e9 Mourinho\u2019s imminent return to Stamford Bridge this season and it got me thinking \u2013 which manager has had the most individual spells at the same club?\u201d</strong> writes Elliot Leaver.</p> <p>Our opening bid is: Martin Allen and his four spells in charge of Barnet.</p> <p>Allen was first appointed in March 2003 before controversially leaving for Brentford a year later. Hatchets were buried in March 2011 when he returned for a second spell but Barnet fans got a familiar feeling when he left for Notts County after only three games in charge.</p> <p>He returned to Underhill in April 2012 to save the club from relegation into the Conference and he went back for his fourth (and current) spell in March 2014.</p> <h2>KNOWLEDGE ARCHIVE</h2> <p><strong>\u201cA friend claims that an All-Ireland XI beat Brazil 3-2 in a friendly in Dublin in the early 70s with Wolves and Northern Ireland\u2019s Derek Dougan scoring the winner,\u201d<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2001/nov/15/theknowledge.sport\"> <br></a></strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2001/nov/15/theknowledge.sport\">asked Brian McKenzie back in 2001</a>. <strong>\u201cI can\u2019t find any record of this game and think he may be telling porkies.

The game was billed as Brazil v Shamrock Rovers Invitational X1 (probably due to the sensitivities of using a phrase like United Ireland at the time). I believe the \u2018Ireland\u2019 team included a couple of Shamrock Rovers players. However, Pat Jennings, Alan Hunter and Derek Dougan played alongside John Giles, Don Givens and Terry Conroy.</p> <p>\u201cI know the Brazil team was :- Leao - Ze Maria, Luis Pereira, Piazza, Marco Antonio - Clodoaldo, Rivellino, Valdormiro, Jairzihno - Paulo Cesar, Dirceu. The goals were scored by Paulo Cesar (2) Jairzinho and Valdomiro with Mick Martin, Derek Dougan and Terry Conroy replying for Ireland.\u201d</p> <p><em>For a lengthier exploration of this game, there was an article in <a href=\"https://www.theblizzard.co.uk/product/issue-twenty/\">issue 20 of the Blizzard </a>that does just that.</em></p> <p><em>\u2022 For thousands more questions and answers take a trip through <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/series/theknowledge\">the Knowledge archive</a>.</em></p> <h2><strong>CAN YOU HELP?</strong></h2> <p>\u201cWhilst procrastinating this morning, I came across Ivorian striker Serge Djiehoua,\u201d writes Christopher Harding . \u201cThis itinerant big man up front appears to be among the front runners for fastest ever sending off, after just seven seconds on the pitch.

  "<p>He may have crossed oceans solo, but it was a storm off the coast of Ireland that swept one-armed yachtsman Keith White overboard. The sailor \u2013 who has since become the first disabled man to cross the Atlantic unassisted \u2013 was circumnavigating the British Isles against the prevailing winds back in 2005, when he was hit by a force-11 gale. </p> <p>His yacht capsized several times in the 10m-high waves, and when the RNLI lifeboat finally reached him <a href=\"http://www.irishtimes.com/news/crew-may-be-honoured-for-sea-rescue-1.464623\">21 hours</a> later, he was thrown overboard, managing to somehow climb back on to his yacht to safety before he was towed back in. Even with three cracked ribs, he refused to halt his challenge. \u201cI discharged myself and got the sails fixed by the end of the week and sailed back home,\u201d he tells me over the phone from his home on the Isle of Wight. \u201cI was frightened to get sailing again, but I had to do it.\u201d</p> <p>Talking to the 68-year-old today, it\u2019s hard not to listen open-mouthed at his refusal to be cowed by anything life throws at him. In 1991 he was at the centre of a 14-vehicle pile-up when a lorry crossed the central reservation and hit the van in which he was a passenger. \u201cThe police thought I was dead,\u201d he tells me. White had stopped breathing. \u201cThey told the ambulance not to rush \u2013 but when they got there [the paramedics realised] I still had a pulse, and revived me.\u201d White survived, but his left arm was crushed beyond repair, and he lost his memory for two years.</p> <p>A former builder, electrician and computer engineer, White previously could speak German and Italian, but lost this facility, as part of his problems recalling words. His pilot licence was removed and he could no longer follow his passion for scuba diving. But he had been sailing since he was 16, and so, in 2004, he decided to buy a boat, fitting it out so he could sail it singlehandedly. \u201cI didn\u2019t know at that point if I could sail with one hand,\u201d he says. \u201cBut at the back of my mind I had always thought I could do anything if I put my mind to it. I think this comes from my mum \u2013 she always said I had the ability to do anything I wanted to.</p> <p>\u201cYou have to try to visualise things in your head before you start. Planning is important; to know what you are about to do and how you will do it. I can do a bow line and tie my laces up with one hand. You just learn a technique.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2d5e31b1b523ab3b684c72596d1ac7bade9edef8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2d5e31b1b523ab3b684c72596d1ac7bade9edef8/0_21_630_378/500.jpg\" alt=\"Keith White: \u2018I never have a negative thought \u2013 you have to have positive mental attitude.\u2019\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Keith White: \u2018I never have a negative thought \u2013 you have to have positive mental attitude.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: HANDOUT</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Within a year, White, a father of seven, had taken on the challenge of being the first one-armed sailor to circumnavigate the British Isles. Then he crossed the Atlantic alone in 2008. Last year he attempted to become the <a href=\"http://www.yachtingmonthly.com/news/disabled-yachtsman-aims-to-sail-solo-around-the-world-32926\">first sailor with a disability to circumnavigate the globe</a>, but had to postpone the challenge after a storm off the coast of Sierra Leone caused mechanical failures.</p> <p>Sailing single-handed for weeks requires mental, as well as physical, strength \u2013 you have to be constantly alert and completely self-reliant. Especially when you are alone in the face of the huge storms White has had to battle. So how does he do it? It\u2019s a question that makes the yachtsman laugh. </p> <p>\u201cWhen you have seven children it\u2019s lovely to have a little time on your own! It\u2019s heaven,\u201d he jokes. \u201cI\u2019m a sociable person: I do like lots of people around. I don\u2019t think about being alone at sea, because I am so busy.</p> <p>\u201cI do a log every hour, and my diary, and I read a few books. I have very little sleep. It took six weeks to sail back across the Atlantic, and I got about 26 hours\u2019 sleep.\u201d</p> <p>Answering emails and chatting over Facebook can help stem any loneliness, he says. Staying optimistic helps for everything else. \u201cDon\u2019t I worry I will die? No, I am a cat! I never have a negative thought: you have to have positive mental attitude.</p> <p> \u201cYou are too busy to think. I don\u2019t panic, I just try and assess the situation and deal with it.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t back down and I don\u2019t like things to control me \u2013 even fear. Fear of failing is the biggest fear for me. I\u2019m not trying to be a hero, I just try to do my best.\u201d</p> <p>After weeks alone at sea, he says, there are physical challenges to walking on dry land. \u201cOn my longest voyage back to Dartmouth, my legs hurt for two weeks because I wasn\u2019t used to walking anymore. I just hadn\u2019t been using those muscles.</p> <p>\u201cIf I turned too quickly, I had the sensation of losing my balance because you aren\u2019t on a boat.\u201d</p> <p>But mentally, he thinks, he adjusts to life on shore quickly now \u2013 the trick, he says, is to stay equally busy on land and sea. \u201cToday I decorated my bedroom. Yesterday I was fitting an alternator on the boat. Before that it was the water pump, and I had to strip the engine back.</p> <p>\u201cMy days fly by and I feel like I am 20 years old. I just try and treat every day as something new and enjoy it.\u201d</p> <p>When he made his first Atlantic crossing he was, he admits, disappointed to have his peace and quiet broken by his arrival on land \u2013 when he was still halfway through reading his novel. But, he says, he threw himself into meeting new people, which soon counteracted his irritation. \u201cI made sure I caught local buses so I could chat to people \u2013 I fill my life with people.\u201d</p> <p>In between adventures, he prepares his boat, and then I ask him how he relaxes. \u201cI go sailing! I like sailing with people who haven\u2019t tried it before. Or I get involved in yacht races with friends.\u201d</p> <p>Perhaps the main reason for his success in adjusting to life after a big adventure, he says, is that he always has an idea for a new one in his back pocket; from raising money for charity to sailing races. \u201cIt keeps me ticking over \u2013 there\u2019s always something new to do. I just like challenges and one leads to another.</p> <p>\u201cMy mum always said the worst part of any job is starting \u2013 the rest comes easy. Unless you make the first step you aren\u2019t going to get anywhere.\u201d</p>",

The rain is coming down in Canberra, there is a coral installation in front of parliament asking pollies to choose the reef over coal and <strong>Malcolm Turnbull</strong> is visiting a building site in a high-vis vest. </p> <p>In the parliament we are preparing for debate and I will give you a full list of legislation in a minute. The reason Turnbull is at a building site is to trumpet that today, children, is all about industrial relations and the Australian Building and Construction Commission. He also wants you to know that he has an economic plan. He says he is willing to compromise on the ABCC bill to get it through. There is your olive branch to the crossbench and specifically <strong>Nick Xenophon</strong> and <strong>Pauline Hanson</strong>.</p> <p>But there are skirmishes and frolics, both within his party and without. <strong>Cory Bernardi</strong> is introducing his private member\u2019s bill in the Senate to remove the words \u201cinsult\u201d and \u201coffend\u201d from the Racial Discrimination Act. This does not mean the bill gets debated yet, it just sits there in the queue. <strong>Eric Abetz</strong> has been out defending the case in a sterling effort on Radio National, which I shall also bring you shortly.</p> <p>Turnbull has just been asked about the marriage equality plebiscite.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We know that a majority of Australians support a plebiscite. We know if there is a plebiscite a majority will vote yes. How long will Bill Shorten keep playing these political games?</p> </blockquote> <p>Late yesterday, the crossbenchers <strong>Adam Bandt, Andrew Wilkie </strong>and<strong> Cathy McGowan </strong>came out with their own bill on marriage equality. Labor has flagged theirs but not revealed the draft yet. Expect this any time today or tomorrow via suspension of standing orders. If not, the first Monday of the next sitting, when private member\u2019s business is due. </p> <p>From the papers, we now know <strong>Malcolm Turnbull</strong> and <strong>Scott Morrison</strong> argued for changes to rein in generous negative gearing tax concessions but lost the battle. There are rumblings that the Coalition is preparing another bank initiative in order to head off Labor\u2019s expected motion for a bank royal commission. Meanwhile Labor bank warrior <strong>Sam Dastyari</strong> is having his own good times, with revelations <a href=\"http://www.smh.com.au/federal-politics/political-news/labor-senator-sam-dastyari-had-chinese-interests-foot-the-bill-for-travel-entitlement-repayment-20160830-gr4mlh.html\">reported by Latika Bourke</a> at Fairfax that he asked a Chinese donor to pay his travel bills after he exceeded the taxpayer-funded allowance.

  "<p>Japan\u2019s defence ministry has requested a record budget to counter growing Chinese military activity around a group of disputed islands in the East China Sea.<br></p> <p>The ministry is seeking 5.17 trillion yen (\u00a338bn) for the year beginning in April 2017. That marks an increase of 2.3% from last year, and is the fifth annual increase since Japan\u2019s prime minister, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/shinzo-abe\">Shinzo Abe</a>, came to power in late 2012 vowing to bolster the military to address a surge in Chinese naval activity and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/north-korea\">North Korea</a>\u2019s nuclear weapons programme.</p> <p>The latest budget request marks a continuation in the shift in focus away from Japan\u2019s northern <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jun/09/russia-build-southern-kuril-islands-seized-moscow-tokyo-abe\">maritime border with Russia</a> \u2013 where cold war Soviet forces once posed a threat \u2013 to an 870-mile chain of southern <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/dec/18/japan-steps-up-military-presence-east-china-sea\">outlying islands</a> stretching from the Japanese mainland towards Taiwan.</p> <p>Much of the hardware on the defence ministry\u2019s shopping list is designed to counter potential threats to Japanese territory in the East China Sea, including the disputed <a href=\"http://senkaku%20islands/\">Senkaku islands</a>, which are also claimed by Beijing.</p> <p>At the heart of the strategy is the development of a mobile amphibious force \u2013 modelled on the US marine corps \u2013 that would be able to respond quickly to an attempt to invade the Senkakus, which China refers to as Diaoyu.</p> <p>In the single biggest outlay, the ministry wants more than 100bn yen to upgrade Japan\u2019s Patriot Advanced Capability (PAC-3) missiles, seen as the last line of defence against a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jan/06/a-grave-threat-why-north-koreas-claimed-nuclear-test-is-a-cause-for-concern\">nuclear</a> or conventional attack by North Korea.</p> <p>The sense of urgency in Tokyo over missile defence is growing amid evidence that North Korea is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/03/north-korea-launches-ballistic-missile-says-south\">making progress</a> in its attempts to build reliable ballistic missiles capable of reaching Japan, including those <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/24/north-korea-tests-submarine-launched-ballistic-missile\">launched from submarines</a>.</p> <p>The improvements will dramatically enhance the PAC-3\u2019s range and its ability to target incoming missiles.</p> <p>The Senkakus are surrounded by rich fishing grounds and potentially huge oil and gas deposits. The uninhabited islets are administered by Japan, but Chinese vessels have stepped up incursions into waters near the territories in recent months.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"94f00abcb853d89834b78a8bc7448022dbc2955e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/94f00abcb853d89834b78a8bc7448022dbc2955e/0_0_4000_2400/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Japanese ground self-defence troops during live-fire training.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Japanese ground self-defence troops during live-fire training.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Aflo/Barcroft</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>To improve Japan\u2019s ability to patrol the islands, ministry officials want to spend 95bn yen on six Lockheed Martin F-35 stealth fighters, as well as more than 90bn yen on four Bell-Boeing V-22 Osprey tilt-rotor aircraft and six Boeing Chinook twin-rotor helicopters.</p> <p>Incursions by Chinese planes into Japanese airspace near the Senkakus were met with a record number of scrambles by Japanese fighter planes between April and June, while Tokyo continued to resist Beijing\u2019s requests for talks on the dispute.</p> <p>This month, the Japanese foreign minister, Fumio Kishida, summoned China\u2019s ambassador in Tokyo, Cheng Yonghua, to protest against Chinese maritime activity in the area, saying it had contributed to a \u201cmarked deterioration\u201d in Sino-Japanese ties.</p> <p>Last week, however, Kishida and his Chinese counterpart, Wang Yi, agreed it was important to establish lines of communication to avoid accidents near the Senkakus that could quickly escalate into a conflict.</p> <p>\u201cWe reached a common recognition that we have to control friction at sea firmly through the efforts of both countries,\u201d Wang told reporters during a trilateral summit in Tokyo that also included South Korea\u2019s foreign minister.</p> <p>As a prominent member of a group of conservative politicians who believe the postwar constraints imposed on Japan\u2019s military are unfair and out of date, Abe wants the country\u2019s self-defence forces to play a bigger international role that includes possible involvement in overseas conflicts.</p> <p>Last summer, his governing coalition pushed through <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/sep/17/japan-to-pass-security-bills-despite-protests\">controversial security legislation</a> that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jun/30/japan-pm-overturn-pacifist-defence-policy-shinzo-abe\">reinterpreted</a> Japan\u2019s war-renouncing constitution to allow the armed forces to exercise its right to collective self-defence \u2013 or coming to the aid of an ally \u2013 for the first time since the end of the second world war.</p> <p>Despite the broader scope afforded Japanese troops by the new laws, speculation is mounting that Abe, whose <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/11/japan-could-change-pacifist-constitution-after-shinzo-abe-victory\">coalition dominates both houses of parliament</a>, will attempt to ditch article 9 of the US-authored constitution, which restricts Japan\u2019s military to a purely defensive role.</p>",

  "<p>It\u2019s been two months since DC\u2019s Rebirth \u2013 an audacious overhaul of the veteran publisher\u2019s entire superhero comics line \u2013 and while the rollout of new comics has been staggered, sales have been supercharged. <a href=\"http://www.previewsworld.com/Article/182670-Top-100-Comics-July-2016\">In July, DC achieved more market share than its bitter rival Marvel for the first time in years</a>.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/aug/03/the-month-in-comics-civil-war-2-faith-and-snotgirl\">The month in comics: Marvel returns to Civil War</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It feels like proof that DC\u2019s course correction is resonating with readers turned off by the publisher\u2019s previous New 52 reboot, which wiped away decades of continuity to focus on younger versions of iconic characters such as Superman and Wonder Woman. But DC hit a roadbump earlier this month with its all new <strong>Superwoman</strong>. This hero was trailed as Lois Lane with Superman\u2019s powers (or at least, one incarnation of Lois \u2013 there are a couple of them knocking about DC\u2019s current multiverse). After showing the street-smart journo getting a handle on her new abilities and cleverly saving Metropolis from a Lex Luthor-derived threat, writer-artist Phil Jimenez wrapped up his densely packed, often beautiful-looking first issue by \u2013 and here is the necessary SPOILER WARNING \u2013 killing her off. Some fans felt cheated, angry or simply confused. Marvel faced a similar backlash earlier this year when Captain America was unexpectedly revealed to be a sleeper agent for the nefarious Hydra organisation in a shocking final-page twist.</p> <p>Yet even in comics, it\u2019s rare for the title character to die in their first issue. So what happens next? Jimenez, who previously worked on an admired run of Wonder Woman in the early 2000s, has hinted at an overarching plan involving his ensemble cast (which includes, in a sneaky bait-and-switch, a second Superwoman) and the social media hoo-ha should at least juice up sales of issue two, due mid-September.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cb63029ea9cd5994e7843ef4b621e0edff519d2d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cb63029ea9cd5994e7843ef4b621e0edff519d2d/0_25_800_951/421.jpg\" alt=\"Kingsway West issue one\" width=\"421\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>There have been countless westerns about grizzled gunslingers seeking the quiet life only to be inexorably pulled back toward violence. In <a href=\"http://gregpak.com/category/comics/kingsway-west\"><strong>Kingsway West</strong></a>, a new four-part miniseries from Dark Horse, the taciturn hero is Kingsway Law, a preternaturally handy-with-the-steel regulator in a 19th-century north California shaped by a very different sort of goldrush. It\u2019s a vivid landscape where valuable-but-volatile \u201cred gold\u201d has caused mutations and magical phenomena, so as well as the standard wild west staples of six-guns and cool leather dusters, there are also bloodhound dragons and enchanted swords.</p> <p>This inventive mix of Game Of Thrones and Unforgiven is notable for featuring a Chinese protagonist in a genre in which Asian characters have long been sidelined as voiceless railroad labour or simply ignored completely. While writer Greg Pak has invested a lot of effort into his alternate-history worldbuilding \u2013 this is the sort of comic that begins with a parchment map \u2013 the story is driven by emotion. Law has something very valuable taken from him, and will do anything to get it back, even in the face of overwhelming odds. With heavily lined art by Mirko Colak and vibrant colour treatments by Wil Quintana, it\u2019s a handsome-looking book that feels as if it could go anywhere.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"39a042e83666b3fed1d2354cac87016115dee674\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/39a042e83666b3fed1d2354cac87016115dee674/0_144_600_675/444.jpg\" alt=\"Torchwood comics cover by Tommy Lee Edwards John Barrowman and Carole E.

To that end, UK-based publisher Titan Comics has been steadily growing its line of <strong>Doctor Who</strong> titles. There are now four separate monthly series, spotlighting Eccleston\u2019s brooding Ninth, Tennant\u2019s ferrety Tenth, Smith\u2019s fez-loving Eleventh and Capaldi\u2019s guitar-shredding Twelfth, respectively. </p> <p>Perhaps looking to complete the post-2005 nu-Who set, Titan has also just launched a new official <strong>Torchwood </strong>series, written by star John Barrowman with his sister Carole. The sci-fi siblings previously collaborated on a Torchwood novel called Exodus Code and the new comic picks up some threads from that story. Captain Jack Harkness is policing time and space in a research boat called the Ice Maiden, complete with a crew of trigger-happy hotties and a wry AI. But when the historical birthplace of Torchwood is attacked, it gives the pansexual rascal an excuse to rescue his old partner Gwen from a Welsh caravanning holiday. With saucy repartee, smart-aleck captions and a bunch of ninjas on flying jet-skis, the Barrowmans seem to be having a whale of a time jump-starting the franchise, and that enthusiasm is infectious</p>",
  "<p>Patrick Abboud came across Tayla Sekhmet\u2019s petition almost by accident. The journalist was scrolling through Change.org while working on another story in Queensland when he saw it: <a href=\"https://www.change.org/p/dysart-state-high-school-school-bullying-is-killing-me-please-help\">\u201cSchool bullying is killing me, PLEASE, PLEASE HELP.\u201d</a></p> <p>\u201cI literally stopped in my tracks,\u201d Abboud tells Guardian Australia. As a child Abboud was savagely bullied in school: dragged through the corridors, spat on and violently abused for years. </p> <p>\u201cThis is a 12-year-old kid, but the way she articulated what was happening to her \u2013 it was like I was reading my own story, word for word. I stopped on the street, I broke down a little bit.\u201d <br></p> <p>Written by Tayla, and signed by her and her mother Kali, the petition describes her school life at Dysart state high school in northern Queensland as \u201ca living hell\u201d. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/aug/30/website-hosting-explicit-images-of-australian-schoolgirls-back-online\">Website hosting explicit images of Australian schoolgirls back online</a> </p> </aside>  <p>She writes about being called \u201cfatso, weirdo, ugly, freak\u201d every day; being pushed to the ground, being told to kill herself. Kids would throw things at her and film it, threatening to share it online; one boy would sexually harass her, she said, and spread sexual rumours about her.</p> <p>\u201cPlease sign my petition to ask Dysart state high school to take a stronger stance against bullying and for the government to stop the school getting away with this,\u201d she wrote. </p> <p>Satisfied that Abboud would be well-placed to tell their story, the Sekhmets eventually agreed to take part in an episode of SBS2\u2019s current affairs program The Feed. But the night before his flight to meet the family with a cameraman, Abboud got a devastating phone call.</p> <p>\u201cIt was her mother, completely hysterical. Tayla had attempted to take her life that day,\u201d Abboud says. He called off the interview. \u201cThere was no way I wanted to put her in a position that could make it even worse.\u201d<br></p> <p>Months later, Abboud was invited to meet with Tayla again, this time in Cairns where she was living with her grandfather. After her petition had gone viral, her bullies had begun to retaliate with such ferocity that child services deemed Tayla be removed not just from her school, but from her town. </p> <p>Tayla\u2019s story, among others with more tragic endings, forms the backbone of a powerful half-hour documentary that aired on Tuesday night, which exposes the fatal epidemic of bullying in Australian schools, and proposes a solution: national criminalisation.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MwBhpTe4D64\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/MwBhpTe4D64?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>\u201cI\u2019ve seen a lot in my years of journalism, but some of the stuff the parents showed me \u2013 I had to leave the room and take a breath,\u201d Abboud says. \u201cIt\u2019s horrifying to think that a 12-year-old could have ideas like that and torture someone else with them.\u201d<br></p> <p>Late last week, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/aug/30/website-hosting-explicit-images-of-australian-schoolgirls-back-online\">a website that hosted sexually explicit images of Australian schoolgirls went back online</a>, with <a href=\"http://www.news.com.au/lifestyle/parenting/school-life/new-schools-added-to-porn-sites-hit-list-after-website-returns/news-story/645a42b4f6391208339db05fa0267106\">News Corp</a> reporting that the list of schools involved had 19 new names added.

Symbolic attacks on places of worship are just one example.</p> <p>One way to appreciate the sharp escalation of conflict in Indonesia is to compare pre-1998 and post-1998 rates of attacks on places of worship. Prior to the democratic transition in 1998, there were reportedly over 450 attacked or closed during Suharto\u2019s regime (1966-1998).</p> <p>Since 1998, civil society organisations have documented a sharp rise in attacks against minority groups. In the first 10 years of democratisation, close to 600 churches were attacked, damaged or forced to close. This trend continues.</p> <p>While tensions between radical Islamists and Christians are well known, in recent years targeted campaigns have been directed against Shia Muslims, Ahmadiyah and Confucians.</p> <p>There has been an increase in attacks on the places of worship of minority communities. There have also been moves by Islamic leaders to ban minority groups by issuing fatwa (an Islamic legal opinion) or by pressuring local government officials to issue regulations that outlaw its activities. It is this combination of tactics \u2013 violence, intimidation campaigns and the use of law \u2013 that is most concerning.</p> <p>The explanation for this is clear. Democratisation has not only created greater freedom of expression, but in the absence of a strong state has amplified the demands of radical Islamic groups.</p> <p>In addition to democratisation, the shift to decentralisation has politicised religion at the local level. This means that in the competitive political environment, local politicians have become increasingly influenced by vocal Islamic leaders and their demands that the state enforce a certain form of Islamic orthodoxy.</p> <p>Of course local governments, with the exception of Aceh, do not actually have the power to use law to regulate religious practice. But in the absence of the national government, they do anyway.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/31/sara-connor-david-taylor-british-australian-couple-reconstruct-murder-bali-policeman-beach\">British and Australian suspects reconstruct death of Bali police officer</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Just last week I spoke at a conference in Jakarta on the rise of religious intolerance.

Jokowi must rise to the challenge of curbing terrorism and addressing religious intolerance.</p> <p>In doing so, Jokowi would be leaving a legacy that affirms that at the heart of democracy is the protection of minorities, rather than simply the rule of the majority.

Starting in 2008 but <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/sep/17/brazil-petrobras-scandal-oil-general-election\">ramping up in 2014</a>, federal police, prosecutors and judges have uncovered a multibillion-dollar kickback and bribery scandal at the state-run oil firm Petrobras, the biggest company in Latin America until the scandal hit.</p> <p>Essentially, contracts were inflated so up to 3% of funds could be channelled to the three parties that previously formed a ruling coalition: the Workers party, the Democratic Movement party of Brazil (PMDB) and the Progressive party. The probe, however, has widened to include other parties and other projects, including the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/apr/08/brazil-rousseff-corruption-belo-monte-dam\">Belo Monte hydroelectric dam</a>. Some predict it will lead to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/oct/15/brazil-impeachment-economy-crisis-corruption\">greatest jailing of lawmakers</a> in world history.</p> <h2>What has been the impact on the country?</h2> <p>The scandal has paralysed the government because bribes were essential for building coalitions. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/16/rio-olympics-crisis-brazil-zika-athletes-woes-uplift\">It has also choked business</a> because prosecutors ordered the suspension of contracts between Petrobras and its major suppliers, which included almost all of the country\u2019s biggest construction and shipping firms. In more than two years, 61% of Petrobras\u2019 276,000 employees <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/mar/20/brazil-petrobras-scandal-layoffs-dilma-rousseff\">have lost their jobs</a>, according to local media. Many smaller firms that depended on its business have been made bankrupt.</p> <p>Many believe this pain will be worthwhile if the investigation leads to punishment of all corrupt politicians and sets the stage for a new era of clean government. But that future is a long way off, if it comes at all.</p> <h2>Why do Brazilian parties need slush funds?</h2> <p>Politicians all over the world need campaign finance, but it is particularly important in Brazil due to the country\u2019s vast size, plethora of parties, three levels of government (with regular elections for municipal, state and national leaders and legislators) and an open-list election system for lawmakers. No single party has ever come close to a commanding majority in Congress, so support is bought with cabinet posts and/or cash.</p> <h2>Who is making the accusations?</h2> <p>The investigation is nationwide, but the charge is being led by judicial figures in the southern city of Curitiba. Most influential among them is Judge Sergio Moro, who has become something of a cult figure for his willingness to take on the country\u2019s most powerful politicians and business people. Other prominent figures include <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/dec/30/brazil-anti-corruption-prosecutor-deltan-dallagnol-lava-jato-investigation\">Curitiba prosecutor Deltan Dallagnol</a> and police chief Igor Romario de Paula.</p> <p>Not everyone thinks they are heroes.

Prosecutors have found no evidence that she was involved and even her enemies acknowledge that she is one of the few politicians in Brazil not to accept bribes.</p> <p>However, it is widely assumed that Rousseff must have known what was going on because she was a former energy minister and chief of staff at the height of the wrongdoing. Many of her confidants have been arrested or are on trial. Whether she was aware of what was going on or not, she benefited from the campaign funds and failed to halt the corruption. Prosecutors allege she also <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/mar/17/brazil-judge-lula-da-silva-appointment-cabinet-wiretap-scandal-rousseff\">tried to obstruct their investigation</a> and protect her ally Lula by appointing him to the cabinet. </p> <h2>Is that why Rousseff was being impeached?</h2> <p>Only partly, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/may/12/the-guardian-view-on-dilma-rousseffs-impeachment-the-political-system-should-be-on-trial-not-one-woman\">for all the wrong reasons</a>. Rousseff has ostensibly been thrown out of office because she window-dressed government accounts ahead of the last presidential election. The charge is that her government filled holes in its accounts by taking loans from state banks without congressional approval.</p> <p>Opponents say this creative accounting \u2013 accounting sleights of hand known as \u201cpedaladas\u201d (pedalling) \u2013 allowed the administration to fund a program for family farmers using money that was not reimbursed until several months later, bypassing Congress, creating a misleading impression of state finances and adding to economic instability.</p> <p>In her defence, Rousseff said the money was not a loan because it was simply being transferred through the state banks from public coffers. Similar practices had also been used by previous administrations, though not at the same scale.</p> <p>But this is a pretext. The real reasons for impeachment are political. Rousseff is enormously unpopular because she is blamed for the multiple crises facing the country and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/09/dilma-rousseff-brazil-impeachment-fight-congress-vote\">has proved an inept leader</a>. But Brazil\u2019s constitution does not allow a no-confidence vote to eject her from office so her enemies are using impeachment to do the job.</p> <p>Some are clearly motivated by a desire to kill the Lava Jato investigation, which Rousseff refused to do. The impeachment process was initiated by Cunha after the Workers party refused to protect him from an ethics committee investigation. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/23/brazil-dilma-rousseff-plot-secret-phone-transcript-impeachment\">Secretly recorded conversations</a> have also revealed that the PMDB leader in the Senate, Romero Juc\u00e1, wanted to remove the president so the Lava Jato investigation could be choked by her successor.</p> <h2>Where does that leave interim president Michel Temer?</h2> <p>Rousseff\u2019s centre-right successor is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/apr/03/brazil-michel-temer-dilma-rousseff-impeachment\">almost as despised</a> as his predecessor after helping lead the campaign to bring down his running mate, then <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/13/brazil-dilma-rousseff-impeachment-michel-temer-cabinet\">naming an all-male, all-white cabinet</a> and losing three ministers to the Lava Jato scandal in his first month in office. At the opening ceremony of the Olympics in Rio, Temer was such an embarrassment that his speech was cut to 10 seconds but still drowned out by boos. He is surrounded by politicians implicated in the corruption scandal and \u2013 as leader of Brazil\u2019s biggest party \u2013 he too has benefited from dubiously acquired campaign financing. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"85d191aae67b0e2961e5af1db0ff4da1038dfe26\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/85d191aae67b0e2961e5af1db0ff4da1038dfe26/0_0_5472_3617/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Michel Temer\u2019s speech at the opening ceremony of the Olympics in Rio was drowned out by booing.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"661\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Michel Temer\u2019s speech at the opening ceremony of the Olympics in Rio was drowned out by booing.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Chris Graythen/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>How has the public reacted?</h2> <p>Polls and street demonstration suggest voters are sick not just of the government, but almost all politicians. In March, an estimated <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/mar/13/brazil-anti-government-protests-dilma-rousseff-rio-de-janeiro\">3 million people joined rallies</a> against Rousseff\u2019s government.

But none of the alternatives are popular. Temer\u2019s administration has ratings in the low teens. Lula\u2019s popularity is higher, but he is also hated by more people. The biggest beneficiary might eventually be former environment minister Marina Silva, a losing candidate in the last two presidential campaigns.</p> <h2>Where does Brazil go from here?</h2> <p>In a best-case scenario, the economy will pick up next year and Lava Jato will purge the nation\u2019s political canker, allowing Latin America\u2019s biggest nation to concentrate more effectively on social equality, sustainable development and regional integration.</p> <p>Alternatively, the old hierarchy will quietly shelve Lava Jato once Lula and Rousseff are out of the way and restore the conservative policies of the past; or even open the way \u2013 as in Italy after the <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-01-30/from-clean-hands-to-carwash-brazil-probe-follows-italian-model\">Clean Hands investigation</a> \u2013 for a Silvio Berlusconi-like right-wing populist.</p>",

  "<p>Conservationists have long known that it\u2019s hard \u2013 and in some cases \u2013 nearly impossible to survive as a tiger in Southeast Asia. Burning forests, high human populations and unflagging demand for tiger blood, tiger skin and crushed tiger bone means the big cats have to tread a daily gauntlet of snares, guns and desperate poachers. Now, conservationists are discovering, belatedly, that the same is largely true for leopards. <br></p> <p>A sobering <a href=\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006320716302658\">new study</a> in Biological Conservation has found that the Indochinese leopard \u2013 a distinct subspecies \u2013 may be down to less than 1,000 individuals. And in the best-case scenario only 2,500 animals survive \u2013 less than the human population of Farmsfield village in Nottinghamshire.</p> <p>\u201cMost people assume that leopards are still common everywhere, whereas everybody probably knows by now that tigers and lions have become very rare in the wild,\u201d said co-author of the study, Jan Kamler with <a href=\"https://www.panthera.org/\">Panthera</a>. </p> <p>This has been in part due to the fact that leopards have been less rigorously studied than tigers and lions, but also the longtime assumption that leopards are more adaptable than many other big cats and therefore able to survive in more degraded habitats, on a wider variety of prey and closer to human dwellings. But even the leopard\u2019s supposed plasticity has not been enough to save them across most of Southeast Asia.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"6ebb36a910b679c380753592bd988ba52ec86e21\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6ebb36a910b679c380753592bd988ba52ec86e21/0_0_1200_720/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A spotted leopard in Cambodia.

They are extinct in Singapore and are potentially extinct in Laos and Vietnam. Meanwhile, the few individuals hanging on in China are not expected to survive. </p> <p>Kamler said the illegal wildlife trade is the biggest factor behind this massive decline. </p> <p>\u201cIn particular, many areas have experienced epidemic levels of snaring, for wild meat and animal parts, which have devastated leopard populations in the region.\u201d </p> <p>Snares are rife across forests in Southeast Asia. Poachers may not be looking to kill a leopard \u2013 they may be after tigers for their body parts or small game for local consumption \u2013 but snares are indiscriminate killers. They will injure or kill any animal that stumbles on them them. Conservationists have warned for years that the forests of Southeast Asia are being <a href=\"https://news.mongabay.com/2012/02/majority-of-protected-tropical-forests-empty-due-to-hunting/\">emptied</a> by overhunting for food, traditional medicine and the pet trade. And the Indochinese leopard is just one of thousands of victims in this local eradication of any living thing bigger than a mouse or a sparrow, a process that has come to be known as <a href=\"https://news.mongabay.com/2014/07/its-not-just-extinction-meet-defaunation/\">defaunation</a>. <br></p> <p>At the same time, Indochinese leopards have been hit hard by deforestation, prey declines and what seems to be an increasing trade in leopard parts, including skins and bones. </p> <p>Although the Indochinese leopard was historically found in habitats across the region, the study found just two remaining strongholds for the subspecies: peninsular Malaysia and the Northern Tenasserim Forest Complex (spanning the border of Thailand and Myamnar). A third site was identified as a priority \u2013 the eastern plains region of Cambodia \u2013 due to the fact that the small population of leopards here have evolved some wild daring behaviors. <br></p> <h2><strong>Cambodia\u2019s banteng-hunting leopards </strong></h2> <p>Leopards are known for tackling an increadly wide variety of prey, but much of that is small and medium-bodied. Not so of Cambodia\u2019s leopards. An upcoming study by Susana Rostro-Garcia, a research student with <a href=\"https://www.wildcru.org/\">Wildlife Research Conservation Unit </a>(WildCRU), found that male leopards in Cambodia\u2019s dry forests routinely tackled one of the biggest animals in the area: <a href=\"https://news.mongabay.com/2012/01/forgotten-species-the-wild-jungle-cattle-called-banteng/\">banteng</a>. These distinctly-coloured wild cattle \u2013 themselves endangered \u2013 can weigh more than ten times the leopard at their heels. </p> <p>Rostro-Garcia, who was also the lead author on the Indochinese leopard study, said that her research in Cambodia\u2019s Eastern Plains is the \u201cfirst study to show that the main prey of leopards was over 500 kg.\u201d <br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f5cc0e6fb261a15a14e72eec06939896419805b7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f5cc0e6fb261a15a14e72eec06939896419805b7/0_0_1260_756/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Banteng move across a camera trap in the dry forests of eastern Cambodia.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Banteng move across a camera trap in the dry forests of eastern Cambodia.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: WWF Cambodia/WildCRU/Forestry Administration</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But Rostro-Garcia found that only big males, not smaller females, were killing banteng. And \u201ceven among the males there were large differences in diets, as some male leopards focused almost exclusively on preying on banteng, whereas other males did not consume banteng at all,\u201d she said. </p> <p>The results were particularly unexpected given the availability of small prey in the ecosystem, such as muntjac (small deer) and various species of monkeys. </p> <p>\u201cThe tiger went extinct in this landscape over 10 years ago, so perhaps its absence allowed the leopard to expand its niche to include larger prey than usual,\u201d Rostro-Garcia said. </p> <p>The leopards of Cambodia are also the last population of Indochinese leopards that are uniformly spotted. Other populations sport a mix of spotted leopards and black, or melanistic, leopards. </p> <p>Indeed, the largest remaining stronghold of Indochinese leopards in Southeast Asia is known for housing almost only melanistic leopards. </p> <h2><strong>Malaysia\u2019s black panthers</strong></h2>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The black coat of melanistic leopards may have made them \u2018perfect stalkers\u2019 in the dimly-lit rainforests</p> <footer> <cite>Reuben Clements</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Not only does Peninsular Malaysia have the biggest population of Indochinese leopards left, but it is home to the largest population of black leopards on the planet. This fact may have helped preserve the population. </p> <p>Their black coats make them \u201cless sought after for their skins compared to spotted leopards,\u201d said Reuben Clements, an Associate Professor with Universiti Malaysia Terengganu, who has studied leopards in the region for several years. </p> <p> He also said the population may have hung on here due to \u201cmore forest\u201d and the fact that the denser canopy of this rainforest could offer \u201cadditional habitat for leopards to utilize and to evade dangers on the ground.\u201d</p> <p> But why are the vast majority of leopards here melanistic? </p> <p>\u201cNo one knows for sure,\u201d said Clements. \u201cSome suspect genetic drift. Others suspect the black coat of melanistic leopards may have made them \u2018perfect stalkers\u2019 in the dimly-lit rainforests, allowing them to compete with tigers for similar sized prey.\u201d</p> <p>As such, black leopards here may have found themselves with an evolutionary advantage. <br></p> <h2> <strong>Leopards in trouble everywhere</strong></h2> <p>The Indochinese leopard survey comes close on the heels of a larger study that found that the world\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/may/04/leopards-have-lost-75-percent-of-historical-habitat\">leopards have lost 75% of their range</a> across their full territory, from South Africa to Java. The survey has resulted in the species being downlisted on the IUCN Red List from near threatened to vulnerable. </p> <p>This means that of all the world\u2019s big cats (those in the genus Panthera) only one, the jaguar, is not considered threatened with extinction \u2013 it remains listed as near threatened. </p> <p>Conservationists, though, believe the situation can be turned around. </p> <p>\u201cIf governments can get poaching and snaring under control, then leopards would have a promising future in the Southeast Asia,\u201d said Kamler, who noted that there was still plenty of empty habitat available with sufficient prey. <br></p> <p>\u201cThe question is whether there will be any leopards left in the region to make a comeback, depending on when the governments finally decide to get serious about reducing the poaching,\u201d he added.<br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/radical-conservation/2016/mar/01/tiger-country-scientists-uncover-wild-surprises-in-tribal-bangladesh\">Tiger country? Scientists uncover wild surprises in tribal Bangladesh</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Combating snaring is particularly tricky, since many forests in the region are already blanketed with snares that would need to be removed \u2013 a difficult, but hardly impossible, task. If achieved, however, de-snaring would aid many other endangered species as well. <br></p> <p>Kamler thinks that leopards may have been largely overlooked in conservation circles because they are smaller and were long-considered to be less threatened than the super-popular tigers.But he hopes these recent surveys serve as a wake-up call. <br></p> <p>\u201cOnce people realize that leopards are becoming just as rare as the other big cats, hopefully there will be more interest in this species, and efforts to save them will increase,\u201d said Kamler, who added that in his opinion the leopard was \u201cthe most beautiful of the large cats.\u201d</p> <p>Okay, so ,tigers might disagree. And so might jaguars and snow leopards. But it\u2019s hard to dispute that leopards are still not getting the attention they deserve \u2013 or require. They may be more flexible than other big cats, but even this can only get them so far against the onslaught of butchery now occurring in Southeast Asia. <br></p> <p>If the region wants to maintain leopards \u2013 or tigers for that matter, or bears, <a href=\"https://news.mongabay.com/2013/02/pity-the-pangolin-little-known-mammal-most-common-victim-of-the-wildlife-trade/\">pangolins</a>, hornbill, banteng, muntjacs, songbirds, monitor lizards, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/radical-conservation/2015/jun/25/dhole-asia-endangered-tiger-ignored\">dholes</a>, pretty much every species of turtle and some species that scientists have probably never even described \u2013 officials will finally have to get tough, really tough, on the wildlife trade. <br></p>",

  "<p>Minority ethnic political candidates face an \u201celectoral penalty\u201d of four points when they stand in areas with large numbers of white voters, according to a study which suggests the trend is being driven primarily by discrimination.</p> <p>Research has found that aspiring politicians who are Muslim face the biggest negative impact, with an eight-point disadvantage at the ballot box.</p> <p>Stephen Fisher, an associate professor at the University of Oxford\u2019s department of sociology, who carried out the research, said that even when all other factors that might depress the vote were taken into account, the race issue still existed.</p> <p>\u201cIf you control for everything you\u2019ve got and you can\u2019t think of anything else that can explain it away then it starts to look like pure prejudice,\u201d he said. <br></p> <p>\u201cThe one thing that I did link it to was anti-immigration sentiment,\u201d he added, warning that measuring prejudice was difficult to do.</p> <p>Fisher\u2019s research is being unveiled in More Sex, Lies and the Ballot Box, a book about elections that has been edited by leading psephologists Philip Cowley and Robert Ford. </p> <p>\u201cSurveys have shown a decline in the numbers of people admitting to racial prejudice \u2013 so if they are telling the truth, we should expect people to vote in a less racist way than in the past,\u201d writes Fisher, in a chapter titled Racism at the Ballot Box: Ethnic Minority Candidates.</p> <p>To address the question he first looked in detail at the 2010 election result because it included large surveys of voters in seats with BME (black and minority ethnic) candidates.</p> <p>\u201cWhen you analyse this data you find that ethnic minority candidates suffered an average electoral penalty of about four points at the hands of white voters. But not all ethnic minority candidates are equally discriminated against \u2013 and not all white voters engage in racial discrimination at the ballot box,\u201d he writes.</p> <p>\u201cMuslim candidates were particularly likely to be discriminated against, by the three-quarters of white voters who expressed negative feelings about immigration. This Islamophobia at the ballot box accounts for just over half of the overall ethnic electoral penalty.\u201d</p> <p>The research, which highlighted a similar trend in 2015, concluded that it was a puzzle why the decline in racism over time had not translated into a drop in the BME electoral penalty.</p> <p>\u201cBut it is clear that racial discrimination remains a problem at the ballot box as in other walks of life,\u201d Fisher adds in the chapter. <br></p> <p>The academic found that BME candidates were not penalised in more diverse areas, but with the exception of Pakistani voters and candidates there was no automatic bonus either. </p> <p>In areas with large numbers of BME voters, the bigger draw was towards Labour, something that the party has tried to take advantage of, Fisher says. </p> <p>\u201cBy contrast, in seeking to modernise and diversify his party, David Cameron\u2019s only choice was to place ethnic minority candidates in overwhelmingly white areas and suffer the electoral penalty because (some) white voters, and not just Conservatives, still prefer their MPs to be white,\u201d he adds. </p> <p>Some BME candidates have said they face difficulties being selected in areas with large white populations because members fear the impact it will have on the election results.</p> <p>However, Fisher argued that it was important for parties to act on the revelations, and to remember that four points was a relatively small margin that would not lose them a seat in the vast majority of cases. He said voters were still much more likely to be swayed by the party they would like to vote for, its leader and policies.</p> <p>He pointed to the way the Conservatives had placed Rishi Sunak in William Hague\u2019s constituency of Richmond, North Yorkshire, which remained an ultra-safe Conservative seat even after a drop in the majority. </p> <p>Amina Lone, co-director of the the Social Action &amp; Research foundation, who stood unsuccessfully for Labour in Morecambe and Lunesdale in 2015, said there was an \u201cunwritten, unspeakable cultural thinking that you must align candidates to the demographics that they represent\u201d.</p> <p>She argued that it made sense at one level, but only affected BME candidates. \u201cHowever, white candidates can represent any constituency. So what happens is you ghettoise the communities, you ghettoise the candidates and it plays into identity politics.\u201d</p> <p>Lone said her experience bucked the trend as she had been chosen in an overwhelmingly white area, and she does not believe race was a deciding factor in the community. However, she said the Conservatives had been better in recent years at avoiding stereotyping candidates.</p> <p>\u201cI would say that its offensive to all communities \u2013 it stigmatises white communities by saying there is an inherent racism, and it stigmatises candidates based on their ethnicity rather than their ability to represent their party.\u201d<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p>",

The most formidable of her critics was another British journalist, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/dec/16/christopher-hitchens-obituary\" title=\"\">Christopher Hitchens</a>, who in 1994 made a film called <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJG-lgmPvYA\" title=\"\">Hell\u2019s Angel</a>. It claimed that Mother Teresa treated the symptoms of poverty while ignoring the causes. She took money from distasteful political figures and rich fraudsters, and didn\u2019t publish any accounts. Her Catholic opposition to abortion and contraception made her a religious fundamentalist. Her Kolkata home for the dying had poor medical standards. It all constituted, Hitchens railed, a \u201ccult of death and suffering\u201d.</p> <p>Should all that disqualify her from being a saint? Hitchens\u2019s critique is polemical \u2013 his <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/missionary-position-2.html\" title=\"\">1995 book on her</a> is framed with attacks on religion in general \u2013 but it airs concerns raised by an Indian doctor, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2003/sep/06/india.religion\" title=\"\">Aroup Chatterjee</a>.

When she told one man \u201cyou are suffering like Christ on the cross, so Jesus must be kissing you,\u201d he replied: \u201cThen please tell him to stop kissing me.\u201d Mother Teresa was unrepentant, insisting that a home for the dying was not a hospital. \u201cWe are not nurses, we are not doctors, we are not teachers, we are not social workers,\u201d she said: \u201cWe are religious.\u201d</p> <p>Certainly, Mother Teresa embraced an \u201costentatious anti-materialism\u201d that bordered on primitivism. In her San Francisco convent, she threw out all the mattresses, carpets, curtains and sofas, arguing that comfort corrupted. In the Bronx she refused to open a home for the poor when the local authorities insisted it had to have an elevator. In Rome she reprimanded her sisters for canning a glut of tomatoes, saying it revealed a lack of trust in God.</p> <p>Yet many found that severity attractive. From the 60s onward she was repeatedly named in polls of the world\u2019s most admired figures. Her compassion for the poor, rejection of consumerism and countercultural lifestyle resonated with the idealism of the times. She became part of the collective imagination as a casual synonym for goodness: \u201cWho do you think you are? Mother Teresa?\u201d</p> <p>But the two sides of the ledger are not incompatible. In war-torn Beirut, ignoring warnings of extreme danger, she crossed the green line <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/1982/08/15/world/hospital-is-visited-by-mother-teresa.html\" title=\"\">to rescue mentally and physically disabled children</a> trapped in a hospital under fire. One Red Cross worker said: \u201cShe saw the problem, fell to her knees and prayed for a few seconds, and then she was rattling off a list of supplies she needed.\u201d She was \u201clike a cross between a military commander and Saint Francis\u201d.

But, when the world\u2019s press were present, she asked about a large building they had passed. It would make a good orphanage she said. It was a government ministry, he replied. But, said the crafty nun, hadn\u2019t the ministry just moved out? Wasn\u2019t it now empty? Well, yes, but \u2026 The minister blustered, but she countered his every response. Every question she asked, she already knew the answer to. She got her orphanage. She used the same techniques everywhere. When she first met the owner of the Daily Mirror, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/greenslade/2011/nov/03/pressandpublishing-daily-mirror\" title=\"\">Robert Maxwell</a>, she asked for a donation. When he offered a measly amount she declined it, and said she would go to the Sun instead. He paid up.</p> <p>Her defenders said she was not cosying up to dodgy rich people, but working in the world as she found it. Bad money could be redeemed by putting it to good use. Her critics called her disingenuous, but she insisted some good was always to be found in every person and any situation. Jesus mixed with disreputable characters. A good act might be a redemptive doorway for a bad person.</p> <p>This combination of personal faith, unremitting dedication, clarity of focus, PR savvy, organisational genius and constant travel made her, in the words of former UN secretary general Javier P\u00e9rez de Cu\u00e9llar, \u201c<a href=\"http://catholic-link.org/2012/09/13/the-most-powerful-woman-in-the-word-mother-teresa-at-the-un/\" title=\"\">the most powerful woman in the world</a>\u201d.A saint is not a perfect person but a holy one.</p> <p>One of the qualities the Catholic church requires to canonise someone is that they have \u201cheroic virtue\u201d. In the past the church allowed decades, even centuries, to pass before declaring someone a saint. With the passing of time a candidate\u2019s foibles and weaknesses faded from common memory, leaving only their towering heroic virtue in the general mind. But, since Pope John Paul II, the fashion has been to accelerate the canonisation process. The Catholic church has made a serious mistake on this. Mother Teresa may merit sainthood, but that is a judgment it would be better to make a century from now.</p> <p>Saints can be signs of contradiction. During the Ethiopian famine of 1985, I visited three refugee camps near Alomata. Grain was being distributed in the first, amid much shouting and pushing. Triage doctors in the second were sorting skeletal people into those in need of treatment, those not yet quite ill enough to warrant it, and those beyond help. The soundtrack to the process was the piercing cries of pleading mothers.</p> <p>The third camp was run by Mother Teresa\u2019s nuns, to care for those deemed too sick for treatment in the second camp. It was an oasis of peace and serenity, where nuns dropped water on to the cracked lips of the dying, or simply sat and held their hands. \u201cDo small things with great love,\u201d Mother Teresa had instructed them. That remains my deepest memory of her.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2015/dec/19/mother-teresa-saint-approval\">As Mother Teresa is made a saint, what does it take to be approved?</a> </p> </aside>",

And earlier this month, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/17/donald-trump-stephen-bannon-breitbart-news-kellyanne-conway\">Trump appointed Steve Bannon</a>, Goldman Sachs banker turned film-maker and former chairman of the self-identified \u201calt-right\u201d Breitbart News website, as his campaign CEO alongside veteran pollster Kellyanne Conway as his campaign manager.</p> <p>The media certainly thinks it\u2019s spotted the upcoming twist. \u201cWhat if Trump and Breitbart could team up, raise some money from outside investors, and bring aboard some of the television executives who built Fox News?\u201d <a href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/what-are-donald-trump-roger-ailes-and-steve-bannon-really-up-to\">asked the New Yorker</a> last week.

As Fox News expert and New York magazine writer Gabriel Sherman <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/aug/21/roger-ailes-gabriel-sherman-fox-news-book-rightwing-media\">told the Guardian</a> recently, the landscape is shifting in rightwing media thanks to Ailes\u2019s fall and Trump\u2019s rise. \u201cFox was this amazing unifier of all the strands of conservatism together \u2026 [Now] it\u2019s kind of a Lord of the Flies situation where everyone\u2019s trying to kill each other.\u201d<br></p> <p>As Trump\u2019s dysfunctional, bare-bones campaign continues to come up short in the polls, a media plan B makes sense. His alt-right base is too small to win an election, but big enough to make him some money afterward.  </p> <p>But this is a plan that has been tried before, and with less than impressive results. </p> <p>The most obvious forerunner was Sarah Palin, seen by many as Trump 1.0. Here was another rightwing \u201coutsider\u201d who, after the 2012 election, attempted to cash in on her stardom with the Sarah Palin Channel, a digital network run with the web-based TV company TAPP.<br></p> <p>Palin charged $10 per month to ride the straight-talk express, with sub-channels <a href=\"http://www.mediaite.com/online/sarah-palin-abandons-subscription-based-online-video-channel/\">including</a> New Life TV \u2013 \u201crecharge your relationships and grow closer to God\u201d \u2013 Live with Joan Lunden \u2013 \u201ca vibrant community for women\u2019s wellness and breast cancer patients and survivors\u201d \u2013 and K-Love TV \u2013 \u201cChristian Rock, Inspiration, and Family Values\u201d.</p> <p>The lineup failed to find an audience and by 2014 the Sarah Palin Channel was <a href=\"http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/11/07/stuck-in-the-lamestream-sarah-palin-tv-has-two-twitter-followers.html\">racking up</a> a mere 36,000 views a month, considerably less than many gardening blogs. The URL now leads to \u201c<a href=\"https://www.sarahpac.com/#modal\">SarahPAC.com</a>,\u201d the home of her political action committee that raises money for conservative candidates.</p> <p>Not far behind Palin\u2019s debacle, and also produced by TAPP, was The Herman Cain Channel \u2013 launched by another Republican presidential wannabe who briefly rose to national prominence. \u201cCainTV\u201d <a href=\"http://www.theblaze.com/blog/2013/08/20/cain-tv-is-no-more/\">died</a> in 2013 but then came back as a low-grade news blog framed by ads plugging Cain\u2019s books and radio shows. \u201cCainTV delivers it all in an Informed, Inspirational, and INtertaining way,\u201d goes its slogan. It too has failed to evolve into the conglomerate the former pizza magnate had likely envisioned. </p> <p>Finally, and perhaps most ominously for Trump, there\u2019s the demise of conservative radio and TV star Glenn Beck\u2019s post-Fox News venture, The Blaze. If anyone was likely to pull off a digital media empire targeting the audience of (relatively) young, pissed-off, conspiratorial conservatives, it should have been Beck.</p> <p>The former Fox host wanted to engineer a fresh news channel from digital beginnings, a scrappy upstart with enough populist appeal to challenge the mighty Fox brand with none of the legacy costs of mainstream media. What he produced was significantly less than that, and it\u2019s been bleeding money and staff for years. The Blaze <a href=\"http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2016/04/28/40-layoffs-as-glenn-beck-s-blaze-empire-continues-its-decline-and-fall.html\">laid off</a> 40 employees in April, as traffic and advertising revenue continued to wither away.</p> <p>The legacy of new media ventures further to the left is equally awful: onetime Democratic presidential candidate and vice-president Al Gore\u2019s CurrentTV failed spectacularly, burning money to attract an audience it could neither find nor hold. It was taken over and rebranded by the deep pocketed Al Jazeera network in 2013, but after three very expensive years Al Jazeera America closed in April.</p> <p>Trump would certainly argue he could do better. But building a media empire isn\u2019t as easy as burning down a political campaign. It requires serious money and a long-term strategy. These are not major turn-ons for the man who <a href=\"http://gawker.com/a-complete-list-of-donald-trump-s-business-disasters-1764151188\">brought</a> you 12-months of Trump Steaks and less than a year of Trump-brand water.</p> <p>\u201cYou gotta remember that Trump doesn\u2019t want to spend a lot of money on this,\u201d said Folkenflik. \u201cIt costs a ton of money. Murdoch had to pay cable providers to put Fox on.\u201d</p> <p>Even if Trump does commit to a more upscale venture, who would have the vision to run it? Ailes seems like an obvious choice until one considers that he\u2019s a 76-year-old in legal trouble and visibly poor health; and he wouldn\u2019t be able to start until his noncompete agreement with Fox News expires at the end of 2018. Still, even pushing 80, it\u2019s hard to imagine him mellowing with age. He has scores to settle with James and Lachlan Murdoch, sons of his former mentor and partner Rupert, who were always looking to <a href=\"https://www.google.com/?ion=1&amp;espv=2#q=lachlan%20murdoch%20ailes\">knock</a> him off his throne.</p> <p>\u201cI think Ailes would love a chance to once more stick it in the eye of the establishment and the Murdoch sons,\u201d Folkenflik said. \u201cBut also, it\u2019s not just that he\u2019s not a young man anymore, it\u2019s that he\u2019s not in good shape. He\u2019s not gonna be the guy in charge.\u201d</p> <p>Meanwhile Bannon, like so many other Trump campaign officials, is in the midst of public and embarrassing scandals, dealing with allegations <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/26/steve-bannon-florida-registered-vote-donald-trump\">that he violated Florida\u2019s voting laws</a> and reports of domestic abuse.</p> <p>Still, those charges may not matter to Trump, who is already happily defending and working with Ailes despite his issues. And they certainly don\u2019t matter to Trump\u2019s base, who tend to dismiss charges against Trump and his campaign as \u201cPC\u201d thuggery and liberal media bias.</p> <p>The final decision lies with Trump; he may jump at the chance to make a TV channel in his image, or he may just license his brand and let someone like Bannon or an Ailes-led brains trust take the reins. Trump loyalists like Fox News star Sean Hannity \u2013 who makes enough money from his radio career to leave his perch at Fox News \u2013 could possibly sign up to join a new splinter cell. Or maybe Trump will simply complete the marriage between his campaign and Breitbart News and put some money into an alt-right shop that\u2019s already <a href=\"http://www.ibtimes.com/trump-loving-breitbart-news-having-great-election-year-despite-massive-meltdown-2345760\">doing well</a>.</p> <p>If the Trumps don\u2019t make it to the White House, the family patriarch may indeed start a new \u201cmedia conglomerate\u201d. But business history, not least Trump\u2019s own business history, suggests a low-risk, low-grade propaganda house rather than a sprawling new cable empire. As his buddy Ailes has no doubt warned him, talk is cheap \u2013 but news is expensive. </p>",

For at least the first 10 years of my life, from 1945 to 1955, my childhood home was under constant MI5 surveillance. My parents knew it, though I did not; and I have spent a lot of the past two years with recently released MI5 records at the National Archives, reading verbatim my parents\u2019 telephone conversations from 60 years ago and the spies\u2019 reports on their movements.</p> <p>I recognise a few of the people described as the adults who peopled my childhood, and I can picture in my mind where the watcher\u2019s car was parked when he reported on my family\u2019s movements. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/1999/dec/11/books.guardianreview\">My father, John Beckett, was a leading fascist</a>. He was in prison for nearly four years during the second world war, then under a sort of house arrest, not allowed to live within 20 miles of London or to travel more than five miles from his home.</p> <p>When these restrictions were lifted, the surveillance continued, masterminded by <a href=\"http://spartacus-educational.com/SSmitchell.htm\">Graham Mitchell</a>, who became deputy director of MI5 in 1956. It is mostly Mitchell\u2019s memoranda I have been reading. They betray a deeply unhealthy pleasure in the secret power his position gave him over the life of another man. At one point Mitchell believes (probably wrongly) that he has caught John out in an extramarital affair. Telephone intercepts have John telling his wife he is having dinner with a male friend, but the man following him says it is a female friend who joins him in the restaurant.</p> <p>Mitchell was also slyly amused to have convinced John that one of his friends was, in fact, an MI5 spy. \u201cMr Mitchell\u201d, reads an internal memorandum. \u201cYou may be amused to know that John Beckett is certain that Major Edmonds gave information to MI5 \u2026 Beckett believed that Edmonds tried to seduce his wife while Beckett was in prison.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>What was true of fascists in the 1940s and 50s is true of suspected Islamic extremists in 2016</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Just after the war my father, against all the odds, managed to get himself a job as assistant administrator at a local hospital. When he was fired, a few months later, he thought it was because he had bought bananas for a desperately sick baby on the black market. But the real reason was that Mitchell seems to have had a quiet word. My mother had always hoped her husband would settle down to a quiet, normal job and give up politics. But when he lost the job, he returned to the only work he could get, running a neo-fascist party called the British People\u2019s party and being paid to do so by its patron, the Duke of Bedford.</p> <p>From all I have read, I draw two conclusions.</p> <p>First, Chakrabarti is right. My father came out of prison far more racist \u2013 and, in particular, antisemitic \u2013 than he went in: a phenomenon familiar to those who have studied wartime detention.</p> <p>After the war, the constant surveillance, which he knew was there but could never pin down, made him just a little mad. He was noisy and entertaining, he could tell a good anecdote, but there was something strange about him. And sometimes he would say something about a race \u2013 about Jews or about black people \u2013 so gross and offensive that, even as a child in the 1950s, it made me start and stare.</p> <p>John was proud of holding himself together in prison when others went to pieces, but this came at the cost of internalising his rage. This, I think, stayed with him during the years after the war, when he knew they were watching him.</p> <p>Second, such a surveillance regime is very bad for the characters of those who govern us. Reading Mitchell\u2019s memoranda, the satisfaction in the covert control he exerted over other people shines through his flat prose.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>If I had been home secretary, I too would have locked up the Oswald Mosleys, the John Becketts and the rest of them</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Yet we must be protected. And in May 1940 we had to be protected against people like my father. That was one of the few moments in history \u2013 with the Germans apparently just a step away from an invasion \u2013 when internment without trial was justified; and if I had been home secretary, I too would have locked up the Oswald Mosleys, the John Becketts and the rest of them.</p> <p>But by 1942 the fifth column had been shown to be a chimera, and an independent panel set up to oversee internment had advised release. Mitchell\u2019s memoranda and those of his political boss, the home secretary Herbert Morrison, show signs of reluctance to give up the arbitrary power over the freedom of others that they had been handed in 1940.</p> <p>After the war, it is very hard to see the justification for the expensive, intrusive and oppressive surveillance that was undertaken. What was true of fascists in the 1940s and 50s is true of suspected Islamic extremists in 2016. There may be moments, like May 1940, when detention without trial in a democracy can be justified, but they are rare and brief. There may be circumstances when spies can be let loose among us, but if it becomes normal, they do far more harm than good. That may well have been the case with my father. The question of who watches the spies should have been important then. It certainly is now.</p> <p>\u2022 Francis Beckett\u2019s Fascist in the Family will be published in September by Routledge</p>",

  "<p>\u201cWe are cleaning the house now\u201d, says Celso Correia. The young, smartly-dressed, minister for land, environment and rural development in Mozambique is talking about the corruption and illegal logging that has dogged the southern African country\u2019s timber sector for more than a decade.<br></p> <p>As recently as 2013, a remarkable 93% of all the logging taking place in the country was happening illegally, according to <a href=\"https://eia-international.org/chinas-illegal-timber-imports-ransack-mozambiques-forests\" rel=\"nofollow\">a report</a> from the nonprofit Environmental Investigation Agency (EIA). </p> <p>As well as leading to unsustainable levels of deforestation, the export of illegally logged timber was also depriving the country of <a href=\" https://eia-international.org/wp-content/uploads/First-Class-Crisis-English-FINAL.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">tens of millions of dollars</a> a year in lost tax revenue.</p> <p>The driving force behind this boom in illegal logging was China, the biggest importer of logs in the world. Chinese traders accounted for more than 90% of Mozambique\u2019s timber exports in 2013, according to the environmental research organisation <a href=\"http://pubs.iied.org/pdfs/G03947.pdf?\" rel=\"nofollow\">IIED</a>. In 2014 Mozambican wood entering China surpassed $400m, up from $90m in 2009, according to <a href=\"http://www.africamonitor-newsletter.com/analysis/southern-africa/mozambique/feb-2016\" rel=\"nofollow\">the Africa Monitor</a> (paywall).</p> <p>Correia, who started in his job in the newly created environment department last year, acknowledges his country is a stark example of what happens when insatiable demand for logs, in this case from China, converges with weak law enforcement and corruption. His ambition is to change that.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b4e9bc56ff3342c8145365bc90b9c7a3ba993ee4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b4e9bc56ff3342c8145365bc90b9c7a3ba993ee4/0_290_5184_3110/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Trucks of woods\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Authorities in Mozambique checking for illegal logs.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Estacios Valoi</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cWe have seized more illegal wood in one year than Mozambique has since independence,\u201d he says. \u201cWe are passing a new forestry law and a new conservation law.\u201d</p> <p>Correia and Mozambique\u2019s long-term ambition is to develop a more sustainable timber market in the country, including developing a larger processing industry in the country rather than just exporting the logs. \u201cWe don\u2019t mind people cutting trees. We need to have a sustainable forest and we need to have a market,\u201d he says.</p> <p>In Gile National Reserve, situated in Zambezia Province, such measures are desperately needed. A total of 35 logging licences created a huge circle of harvested land around the reserve boundary for the 2,980km squared of protected area. After years of logging in the country, the reserve is the last area where Pau Ferro, a highly sought-after wood, still exists in Mozambique.</p> <p>Gile National Reserve attracts few tourists but an alarming number of illegal loggers, according to the warden Jose Dias. Since 2012, his team has captured a total of 58 trucks and 10 tractors packed with Pau Ferro from the reserve. He told me, \u201cthe majority of illegal acts are not detected\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/maps/embed/aug/2016-08-19T12:45:53.html\" data-alt=\"Mozambique\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/maps/embed/aug/2016-08-19T12:45:53.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Mozambique</a> </figure>  <p>Dias said the looting amounted to organised crime and involved a network of government officials, Chinese buyers, communities and even staff from inside the reserve. </p> <p>The government has responded to the issue by banning the cutting of Pau Ferro for five years. But the ban means little to Jorge Bing, a major timber dealer in Zambezia province. \u201cWhen villagers bring you the best wood on the market, \u201d he told me, \u201cwhy would you say no to it?\u201d</p> <p>The other ambition: to create a domestic processing market for timber in Mozambique, is not new. The government issued a partial export ban of so-called first class wood species in high demand from China, including Pau Ferro, in <a href=\"http://faolex.fao.org/docs/pdf/moz61589.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">2002</a> [pdf]. In late 2015, the Mozambique government then decided to <a href=\"http://africageographic.com/blog/mozambique-announces-immediate-ban-timber-exports/\" rel=\"nofollow\">expand the ban</a> to all raw timber logs for two years. </p> <p>The ban was meant to create added value in Mozambique, by encouraging the processing of wood into planks before they are exported to China, but it does not appear <a href=\"http://blog.cifor.org/22055/surge-in-chinese-demand-exposes-cracks-in-mozambique-forest-policy?fnl=en\" rel=\"nofollow\">to be working</a>. \u201cThe domestic processing sector does not have the capacity to absorb the logs,\u201d says Anne Terheggen, a sustainable trade specialist from Centre for International Forestry Research.</p> <p>Correia says he hopes to entice more responsible Chinese companies to Mozambique. \u201cWhen they decide to come, they will be the ones who solve our problems.\u201d<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"360daa5379b52d3fdf1248d03da2739dc7069756\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/360daa5379b52d3fdf1248d03da2739dc7069756/0_295_4672_2804/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Authorities measuring seized illegal logs in the Natural Reserve Gille\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Authorities measuring seized illegal logs in the Natural Reserve Gille</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jean-Baptiste Deffontaines</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>One of these new, potentially more responsible approaches is being proposed by Zheng Fei, a 50-year-old Chinese timber businessman who\u2019s been in Mozambique since 1998, and who has declared his intention to build a \u201cSino-Mozambique forest resource ecological zone\u201d. He\u2019s already received technical advice from WWF on the project.</p> <p>In a 3km square piece of land located in Mocimboa da Praia, a port city in northern Mozambique, the ecological zone for now only has a sawmill and a wood-drying plant. According to Zheng\u2019s plan, within five years, as well as ensuring a responsible attitude to timber resources, the site would host a complete production line for furniture and other wood products as he hopes to encourage other Chinese companies to set up in the zone.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/dec/11/china-illegal-logging-deforestation\">China at the centre of 'illegal timber' trade</a> </p> </aside>  <p>This may be optimistic with China under pressure to source raw wood materials for its own manufacturing sector due to a lack of domestic supply, <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.woodmarkets.com/publication/china-book/outlook-to-2015/\" rel=\"nofollow\">according to </a>consulting firm International Wood Market Group.

An unforced error makes it deuce. A lucky slice by Rosol that just skims the net gives him the advantage but another shot over the line brings it back to a second deuce. Another unforced error gives Murray a break point opportunity, the first in the match, but can\u2019t capitalize as Rosol gives a great volley after a serve return. A double fault gives Murray his second break point...but once again, the serve is too much for the no. 2 and it\u2019s 40-40 again.

The No. 2 ranked player in the world faces Lukas Rosol (81st) from the Czech Republic as he looks to win his fourth Grand Slam title. A week after winning gold in Rio by defeating a resilient Juan Martin del Potro, the Scot lost to Marin Cilic in the Cincinnati Masters final and enters Flushing Meadows with a 50-7 record for the calendar year. After watching Djokovic\u2019s laboring victory over Jerzy Janowicz last night, Murray must feel confident of winning the whole thing. The defending champion did not look 100% as injuries to his left wrist and right arm made for a sub-par performance, so Andy knows that this is a great chance to claim his second US Open title. </p> <p>Both players have an interesting history. Last year at the Munich Open, Rosol shoulder-bumped Murray as they were switching sides, causing the Scot to yell, \u201c<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WxtNxV4yZeE\">No one likes you on the tour, everyone hates you\u201d</a> as he was about to return Rosol\u2019s serve. It was basically the Mean Girls equivalent of ATP tour men\u2019s tennis and despite the fact that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/29/lukas-rosol-plays-down-history-andy-murray-us-open\">both players have admitted</a> that it\u2019s all water under the bridge, you can\u2019t help but think this will be on the back of their minds as they enter Arthur Ashe Stadium. <br></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WxtNxV4yZeE\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/WxtNxV4yZeE?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>From a game-plan perspective, Murray will be wary of how aggressive Rosol is from the start: the last two times they have faced each other, the Czech has won the first set. But I\u2019m sure the quick jump will not bother the Scot as Rosol usually fades once the match enters the hour-mark.<br></p> <p>Stay tuned, this should be a good one. <br></p> </div>   </div>",

It is obvious that the Chinese government has violated human rights and the current situation is very, very worrying,\u201d he added. </p> <p>World leaders will fly into Hangzhou, the capital of Zhejiang province in eastern China, later this week ahead of the two-day summit which kicks off on Sunday. </p> <p>Obama and Xi are scheduled to meet for the first time on Saturday for what the White House this week called \u201can extensive bilateral meeting\u201d. </p> <p>Officials said the pair would then share a \u201csmall dinner\u201d on Saturday night. </p> <p><a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2016/08/29/press-briefing-press-secretary-josh-earnest-deputy-nsa-strategic\">Speaking on Monday</a>, Ben Rhodes, Obama\u2019s deputy national security adviser, said the US president would use his time with Xi to review \u201call of the issues that have been front and centre in the US-China relationship for the last seven and a half years\u201d including flash-points such as the South China Sea, cyber espionage and \u201cour longstanding differences on human rights\u201d. </p> <p>Teng, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/24/academics-china-crackdown-forces-intellectuals-abroad\">who fled China in September 2014</a> and lives in exile in New Jersey with his family, said White House officials had summoned a small group of activists \u201cto talk about the G20 summit and what President Obama should do when he is in Hangzhou\u201d. </p> <p>Also invited to the meeting were <a href=\"http://www.wsj.com/articles/meet-lu-jun-one-of-chinas-most-wanted-social-activists-1441521914\">Lu Jun</a>, a civil society activist who was forced to leave China after security forces targeted his organisation; the Tibetan activist Golog Jigme; the executive director of the Washington-based Uyghur Human Rights Project, Alim Seytoff; and Bob Fu, a prominent Christian activist. </p> <p>Zhang Qing, wife of the democracy activist Guo Feixong, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/23/china-democracy-activist-enters-second-week-of-hunger-strike\">who has been on hunger strike in a prison in southern China</a>, is also understood to have been present. </p> <p>Speaking after the meeting, which lasted about 80 minutes, Teng said he had told Rice he hoped Obama would publicly call for the release of a series of \u201cpolitical prisoners\u201d and activists. They included the jailed Uighur scholar <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/apr/28/salman-rushdie-condemn-china-jailing-ilhan-tohti-paul-auster\">Ilham Tohti</a> and Nobel laureate <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/dec/25/china-jails-liu-xiaobo\">Liu Xiaobo</a> as well as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jun/08/childs-heartbreak-li-heping-human-rights-lawyer-china-superhero\">Li Heping</a> and Wang Quanzhang, two civil rights lawyers caught up in a Communist party crackdown on their trade.</p> <p>Teng also urged Obama to highlight the plight of dissidents being held in prisons in Hangzhou, the G20\u2019s host city, and to draw attention to local political activists who have been placed under house arrest to prevent them speaking out ahead of the summit. </p> <p>Rice had not indicated to her guests how Obama planned to handle human rights issues during his visit to China, Teng added. <br></p> <p>\u201cShe didn\u2019t say anything about what they are going to do but we did give her a clear message. We know it will be President Obama\u2019s last trip to China and Asia as American president and we hope that the American government can really give a message to China and to the world that human rights are part of American policy.\u201d</p> <p>Asked if she was hopeful that the US might publicly denounce Xi\u2019s crackdown, Sophie Richardson, the China director of Human Rights Watch, said: \u201cI don\u2019t see a good reason what they can\u2019t \u2026 It\u2019s a question of whether they really believe that this is an important issue and are wiling to put it out in a very frank and public way while standing in China.\u201d </p> <p>Richardson said Obama \u2013 who received the 2009 Nobel peace prize for his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/oct/09/nobel-peace-prize-barack-obama\">\u201cextraordinary efforts to strengthen international diplomacy and co-operation between peoples\u201d</a> \u2013 had a particular duty to demand the release of Liu Xiaobo, China\u2019s best-known dissident. Liu <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/oct/08/nobel-peace-prize-liu-xiaobo\">was awarded the same prize a year later</a> after being jailed for 11 years for subversion as a result of his calls for political reform. <br></p> <p>\u201cI do think that it would be unconscionable for the 2009 Nobel peace prize winner to fail to publicly call for the release of the 2010 Nobel peace prize winner. Unconscionable,\u201d Richardson said. <br></p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s done it from Washington. He\u2019s done it from New York. They\u2019ve done it in statements. He needs to stand up in public in China and say that. If Obama is really standing with civil society that\u2019s what he must do. If he is genuinely concerned about the fate of independent organisations and lawyers he cannot do less.\u201d</p> <p>Political opponents also urged Obama to confront Xi over human rights abuses, although an anticipated joint announcement that the US and China <a href=\"http://www.scmp.com/news/china/policies-politics/article/2008593/landmark-step-china-and-us-ratify-paris-climate-deal\">will ratify the Paris climate agreement</a> makes it unlikely he will be overly critical of his hosts. </p> <p>In a statement, the Republican senator Marco Rubio said: \u201cI am glad the Obama administration is meeting with men and women who can speak authoritatively about the Chinese government\u2019s gross human rights abuses, but I urge the president to meet with these freedom fighters himself and then press President Xi directly at the G20 summit regarding his government\u2019s failure to uphold the rule of law and its violations of the Chinese people\u2019s basic human rights.\u201d </p> <p>Chris Smith, a Republican congressman who chairs the congressional-executive commission on China, said: \u201c[Obama] should consider doing something radically different on his last trip to China, something that will give hope to China\u2019s dissidents and freedom advocates. Mildly raising human rights issues is important, but not enough anymore.\u201d </p>",

After moving to a new school, Greta (Bethany Whitmore from The Family Law) struggles in her new friendships with quirky kid Elliot (Harrison Feldman from Upper Middle Bogan) and a trio of fiercely intimidating teen girls. </p> <p>When her parents throw her a devastatingly awkward birthday party, with all her new schoolmates invited, Greta\u2019s inner anxieties spring to surreal life.<br></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oQOgdGe7gE\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/6oQOgdGe7gE?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>The film version began with <a href=\"http://adelaidefilmfestival.org/about-aff-investment-fund/hive-lab\">creative workshop</a> in 2011 hosted by the Adelaide film festival, which brought together artists from various disciplines and encouraged them to consider filmmaking. Though Myers had never turned her hand to cinema before, she and Whittet (an experienced screen actor, with credits in The Great Gatsby and Moulin Rouge) were encouraged to pitch a feature.<br></p> <p>That cross-disciplinary background may account for some of its success, as Girl Asleep is one of the most inventive creations to hit local screens in some time. The dense production design by Jonathan Oxlade conjures 1970s Australian suburbia and the symmetrical compositions have drawn comparison to the work of Wes Anderson \u2013 though some will be reminded most of the freewheeling British sitcom The Mighty Boosh. </p> <p>There\u2019s a definite theatricality to the visuals, shot by cinematographer Andrew Commis, but Myers\u2019 keen sense of staging gives it a fully cinematic feel. </p> <p>\u201cRose [Myers] is incredibly good at creating a picture,\u201d Whittet says. \u201cWhen we do it on stage, a lot of it becomes about finding where you sit in the space and how to get the most dynamic tension out of a scene, using bodies.

We have a very aligned aesthetic. It was key to get Andrew and our editor, Karryn de Cinque, to fit within that mix.

Apparently you can blow people\u2019s minds pretty quick if you do something in 4:3. They are all going to start fiddling with their dial and ringing up the station and complaining that something\u2019s wrong with the picture.</p> <p>\u201cWe didn\u2019t know whether film was going to travel. Every step along the way we just wanted to make something that excited us.\u201d</p> <p>That their idiosyncratic vision made it to the screen intact is a credit to the flourishing film culture in South Australia, represented by institutions such as the South Australian Film Corporation, one of the funders behind the film, and the Adelaide film festival, which has its own screen fund and which has supported other innovative Australian productions like 52 Tuesdays \u2013 two stars of which also appear in Girl Asleep. </p> <p>\u201cThere are some really amazing champions in Adelaide,\u201d Whittet says. \u201cI think individual voices get a chance to speak. It\u2019s very hard in a market-driven industry to find ways in which people will take a punt on individual voices. As long as the budget and the cost are not exorbitantly expensive, then it means there\u2019s room for risk. Sometimes that won\u2019t work but sometimes you get things out of it that are really exciting. </p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s the individuality of the voices that come out of Australia that\u2019s actually what sets a film apart when you take it overseas.\u201d </p> <p><em>\u2022 Girl Asleep previews in Perth and Melbourne on 1 September, before an Australian release on 8 September.</em></p>",

Tobacco lobbyists had ready access to legislators to ensure that measures to deal with the health consequences were thwarted.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/aug/19/gas-supplies-to-rise-and-secret-contracts-to-be-scrapped-under-coag-reform-plan\">Gas supplies to rise and secret contracts to be scrapped under Coag reform plan</a> </p> </aside>  <p>While over 20,000 Australians were dying each year because of tobacco smoking, and children were being actively enticed into smoking addiction, their lives were valued less than an increasingly discredited industry. It remains a stain on governments of those days.</p> <p>The tragedy of asbestos mining, transportation and usage in Australia is another cautionary tale <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/08/asbestos-is-far-from-a-legacy-issue-this-is-no-time-to-rest-easy\">still being played out</a>. Mining continued, with active government support, well past the time when there was unequivocal medical evidence of lethal harm being caused by asbestos elsewhere in the world. Political intervention began far too late to prevent the deaths of thousands, with hundreds of distressing deaths still occurring.</p> <p>Another cloud of preventable misery is gathering in our land and beyond our shores with the dangerous push to tolerate and expand coal mining and unconventional gas extraction. The reasons for political short-sightedness are similar to those that prevailed with tobacco and asbestos.</p> <p>The fundamental reason has been the distortion of the political process that has enabled powerful commercial interests to buy political favours to crush health and environmental concerns and work against the wider public interest.</p> <p>There are glaring examples where the mining industry has gained <a href=\"http://www.abc.net.au/news/2013-07-18/when-sand-mining-native-title-and-political/4829584\">political favours</a> through <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/feb/01/australian-political-donations-2014-15-resource-tycoons-and-unions-among-top-donors\">large direct and indirect donations</a> to political parties and favours to individual public servants and legislators.</p> <p>There also continues to be a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/mar/01/larissa-waters-ban-donations-from-mining-companies-and-stop-ministers-working-for-them\">revolving door of appointments</a> from the mining sector to pivotal public service positions and political careers, and the reverse. The industry has had, and continues to have, extraordinary access to policy makers and legislators.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.tai.org.au/content/greasing-wheels\">A report </a>by the Australia Institute and the Australian Conservation Foundation analysing this process in Queensland has laid bare the extent of this distortion of good governance in that state, and exposes the failure of successive Queensland governments to allow sufficient scrutiny.</p> <p>Genuine health and environmental concerns, and their associated financial consequences, are given minimal weight compared to that given to the proponents of exploration, mining, transportation and combustion of coal and of unconventional gas extraction and usage.</p> <p>By comparison, access by organisations and individuals who have real expertise in the health effects of coal mining go unheeded.</p> <p>This is nothing short of outrageous.</p> <p>It is estimated that air pollution in Australia already causes around 3000 deaths annually, more than the motor vehicle accident toll. Most of those deaths are from particulate matter released by mining, transport and combustion of coal.</p> <p>The recognition of black lung disease in coal miners in Queensland is a vivid reminder of the dangers involved. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/jul/13/queenslands-black-lung-safeguards-major-system-failures-exposed\">inadequacy of regulatory standards</a> and enforcement has led to debilitating illness and death.</p> <p>The same could have been said of the asbestos tragedy on a much larger scale, and will eventually be said about coal mining.</p> <p>Climate change resulting from the cumulative effects of global fossil fuel combustion is already causing multiple <a href=\"http://dea.org.au/images/general/DEA_Climate_Change__Health_Fact_Sheet_final.pdf\">health consequences</a>, including deaths, from heat stroke, dehydration, bushfires, floods, typhoons, storm surges, vector borne diseases, cardio-pulmonary diseases and allergies. All of these problems will worsen as climate changes become more pronounced.</p> <p>Australia continues to lead the world in tobacco control and has saved the lives of thousands by doing so. It has protected its children in the process. It has belatedly learned some painful lessons on asbestos.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/jul/13/queenslands-black-lung-safeguards-major-system-failures-exposed\">Queensland's black lung safeguards: 'major system failures' exposed</a> </p> </aside>  <p>By comparison, Australia is ignoring the overwhelming evidence that fossil fuels must be rapidly phased out in the early part of this century. Australia is blessed with abundant solar, wind and wave resources but it has been deceived into becoming a laggard rather than a leader in harnessing them.</p> <p>It appears that the Coag decisions in their subservience to fossil fuel interests asked for information on the additional costs of renewable energy imposed on the national electricity market.

  "<p>Gerard Baden-Clay\u2019s conviction for the murder of his wife, Allison, has been restored by the high court.</p> <p>The ruling on Wednesday upholds the 2014 finding by a supreme court jury that Baden-Clay, 45, a former Brisbane real estate agent, murdered his wife Allison at their Brookfield home in 2012.</p> <p>It follows an appeal by the Queensland director of public prosecutions against the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2015/dec/08/gerard-baden-clays-conviction-downgraded-to-manslaughter\">downgrading of murder to manslaughter by the Queensland court of appeal</a>, a decision that prompted a protest by thousands of people in Brisbane.</p> <p>Baden-Clay has now exhausted all avenues of appeal and will again receive a life sentence in prison.</p> <p>The court of appeal overturned the murder conviction last December, ruling that Baden-Clay may have accidentally killed his wife.</p> <p>The trio of appeal court judges, led by Chief Justice Cate Holmes, had previously found the prosecution\u2019s account of his motives for murder \u2013 including financial difficulties and the strain of their relationship amid an extramarital affair \u2013 was not sufficient.</p> <p>But in a unanimous judgment, the high court found the appeal court was mistaken by finding the jury\u2019s murder verdict unreasonable on the grounds the prosecution had failed to eliminate the theory of Baden-Clay unintentionally killed his wife.</p> <p>The appeal court accepted the argument by Baden-Clay\u2019s lawyers, made for the first time on appeal, that prosecutors had not done enough to rule out the \u201chypothesis\u201d of a physical confrontation with Allison in which he delivered a blow that killed her \u2013 including by a fall leading to a fatal head injury \u2013 without meaning to do so.</p> <p>The high court found \u201cthe hypothesis on which the court of appeal acted was not available on the evidence\u201d, a statement from the court said.</p> <p>It noted that Baden-Clay at trial denied fighting with his wife, killing her and then dumping her body, which was found under a bridge at Kholo creek 11 days after she went missing.</p> <p>\u201cHis evidence, being the evidence of the only person who could give evidence on the issue, was inconsistent with that hypothesis [of manslaughter]. </p> <p>\u201cFurther, the jury were entitled to regard the whole of the evidence as satisfying them beyond reasonable doubt that the respondent acted with intent to kill or cause grievous bodily harm when he killed his wife.\u201d</p> <p>Kerry-Anne Walker, a friend of Allison, told reporters outside the court in Canberra that the ruling brought \u201cboth relief and elation\u201d and \u201cbrings to an end Gerard\u2019s attempts to smear Allison\u2019s name\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cDespite many Queenslanders being labelled as ignorant when they protested the downgrade to manslaughter, the common sense of the original jury has prevailed and justice for Allison has finally been realised,\u201d Walker said.</p> <p>Baden-Clay had \u201cmurdered his amazing wife Allison\u201d then let her family \u201cand the whole community worry and anguish about what had happened\u201d, Walker said.</p> <p>She said Allison loved being a wife and a mother and was an amazing woman whose legacy will be her three girls.</p> <p>Her daughters were thriving in their busy lives and would go on to achieve great things, a tribute to Allison\u2019s parents who now care for them, Walker said.</p> <p>One of the highest profile crimes in recent Australian history, the murder case turned on evidence including scratches on Baden-Clay\u2019s cheek which he claimed were shaving cuts, and the role of his extramarital affair.</p> <p>Baden-Clay testified that he went to bed on 19 April 2012, leaving his wife in the living room of the rented home they shared with their daughters.</p> <p>He claimed he awoke the next morning to find her missing but that she often went for early morning walks.</p> <p>After trying to reach her on her phone and driving around looking for her, he called emergency services to report her missing. </p> <p> That day, Allison was due to attend a property conference where Toni McHugh, a woman her husband had been in a four-year sexual relationship with, would also be present.</p> <p>Allison had believed the affair was over in 2011 but Baden-Clay had told McHugh he would leave Allison by 1 July 2012.</p> <p>Police investigating Allison\u2019s disappearance noticed injuries to Baden-Clay\u2019s right cheek, which he claimed were shaving cuts.<br></p> <p>But three experts at trial gave evidence one set of scratches was likely from clawing fingernails. The trial judge, John Byrne, in sentencing said Allison had \u201cleft her mark\u201d on her killer during a fatal struggle.</p> <p>The high court found the jury was entitled to \u201cregard the lengths to which [Baden-Clay] went to conceal his wife\u2019s body and to conceal his part in her demise as beyond what was likely, as a matter of human experience, to have been engendered by a consciousness of having unintentionally killed his wife\u201d.</p> <p>The hypothesis that the court of appeal said was open to the jury - that Baden-Clay\u2019s dumping of Allison\u2019s body and his subsequent lies about it did not necessarily mean he intended to kill her \u2013 flew in the face of the total \u201ccircumstances established by the evidence\u201d.</p> <p>The court of appeal had thus relied on a theory based on \u201can impermissible \u2018piecemeal\u2019 approach to that evidence\u201d, the high court said.</p> <p>\u201cFinally, the jury could take into account the absence of any signs that a weapon was used to cause the death of the deceased, and make their own judgment about [Baden Clay]\u2019s intention at the time, bearing in mind the difficulty involved in killing a human being without the use of a weapon unless the act of killing is driven by a real determination to cause death or grievous bodily harm.\u201d</p> <p>Bill Potts, the president of the Queensland Law Society, told the Nine Network after the decision: \u201cLess than 5% of cases each year get to be heard by the high court, so for them to look at a decision by the court of appeal and to then overturn that decision so emphatically is quite a red letter day.</p> <p>\u201cHe has no further appeals \u2026 and life imprisonment is the only sentence he can receive in the circumstances.\u201d</p>"
