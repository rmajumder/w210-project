  "<p>There is more than a little yellow peril in the latest political donations debate, which began with Labor senator <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/sep/07/dastyaris-donations-reveal-a-bigger-story-of-links-and-largesse\">Sam Dastyari\u2019s acceptance of payments from companies</a>, some of which had links to the Chinese government.</p> <p>Distractions abound but here is the bottom line. Never mind race. Everyone donates for a reason. Often that reason is access or influence. If we all agree that undue influence over the political system is a bad thing, change needs to happen.</p> <p>But how hard is it really? Three professors of law, Graeme Orr of the University of Queensland, Anne Twomey of the University of Sydney and George Williams of the University of New South Wales provided their opinions.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/sep/07/dastyari-affair-goodbye-second-chance-sam-but-we-really-need-donation-reform\">Dastyari affair: goodbye, second-chance Sam. But we really need donation reform | Katharine Murphy</a> </p> </aside>  <h2>What are the limitations?</h2> <p>The NSW Liberal government tried to ban donations from all but individuals on the electoral roll (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/sep/08/malcolm-turnbull-says-ideally-donations-should-be-limited-to-australian-voters\">an option still favoured by Malcolm Turnbull</a>). This was struck down in the NSW Unions case as constitutionally invalid by the high court in 2013 on the basis it breached the implied freedom of political communication in the constitution.<br></p> <p>Twomey says the judges took the view that there were many in the community who are not electors, but who are governed and affected by the decisions of government.</p> <p>\u201c[The view was] they have a legitimate interest in governmental action and the direction of its policy and may seek to influence the outcome of elections,\u201d Twomey said. </p> <p>\u201cThis includes unions and corporations. Any ban at the commonwealth level would face the same constitutional problems (unless the high court were to change its approach).\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"https://theconversation.com/in-mccloy-case-high-court-finally-embraces-political-equality-ahead-of-political-freedom-48746\">But in a later case</a>, the high court upheld the validity of the NSW ban on political donations by property developers and the imposition of caps upon political donations.</p> <p>\u201cThis tells us that where there is a legitimate reason to do so (for example a serious risk of corruption), the parliament may enact laws to ban donations from particular groups,\u201d Twomey said. </p> <p>\u201cHence, a ban on foreign donations may be permissible, if it is seen as being supported by a legitimate concern about foreign influence over Australian elections.\u201d<br></p> <p>While the Coalition has resisted any donations reform thus far, Labor has called for a ban on foreign donors, so let\u2019s start there.</p> <h2>Foreigner money flows </h2> <p>There is an oft-quoted claim \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/sep/05/sam-dastyari-donation-row-coalition-steps-up-attack-on-bill-shorten\">I have reported it in the past</a> \u2013 that <a href=\"http://www.idea.int/political-finance/bans-and-limits-on-private-income.cfm\">66% of the world</a> bans all foreign donations. But Orr says many countries included in that 66% regulate donations but do not have an outright ban.<br></p> <p>\u201cFor example, France only bans contributions from foreign states or foreign parties,\u201d Orr said. \u201cSweden\u2019s rule just criminalises money from foreign states attempting influence. Canada explicitly permits permanent residents to donate.\u201d</p> <p>So the world is not at one on this.</p> <p>But while we recently discovered UK and American investors are the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/sep/07/uk-and-us-dwarf-china-as-top-foreign-investors-in-australian-agricultural-land\">biggest buyers of our agricultural land</a> \u2013 well ahead of China \u2013 there is no telling who are the top 10 foreign donors to Australian political parties because we do not classify them. Foreign and domestic donations are treated the same. </p> <p>That is, parties and donors have to declare but all we see is a name or company name, an address and a phone number.</p> <p>This creates an extraordinary opaqueness in the financial disclosure list, which is broad but shallow. Transparency would be a start. </p> <p>Orr says while the law reaches outside our borders to limit activity affecting Australia, if a foreigner breaches such a law, enforcement is difficult.</p> <p>He believes banning foreigners is like banning property developers. \u201cIt\u2019s too piecemeal,\u201d Orr says. \u201cComprehensive reform would cap donations and expenditure.\u201d</p> <h2>It\u2019s all about the domestic donation system</h2> <p>While the Coalition has argued the Dastyari case is about payment rather than a donation, a number of Coalition MPs (transport minister Darren Chester, trade minister Steve Ciobo and Craig Kelly) have been open to the Turnbull option to ban all donations from anyone other than on the electoral roll.</p> <p>But after the two court cases, is it constitutionally possible? </p> <p>Williams says no.<br></p> <p>\u201cThis is ruled out by the 2013 high court decision in the Unions NSW case,\u201d he said. </p> <p>Orr says \u201cmaybe\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cI believe the court would uphold a Canadian model where only citizens and permanent residents can donate and then subject to caps,\u201d Orr said.</p> <p>\u201cWithout caps, a [Gina] Rinehart or [Clive] Palmer could wield even more influence.\u201d</p> <h2>Third parties or the GetUp clause</h2> <p>Turnbull also wants to rein in third-party activists like GetUp. In answer, Liberal senator Cory Bernardi has started <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/jul/06/cory-bernardi-establishes-rightwing-movement-australian-conservatives\">Australian Conservatives</a>. <a href=\"http://www.smh.com.au/federal-politics/political-news/cory-bernardis-australian-conservatives-group-signs-up-50000-people-online-20160801-gqin07.html\">He claims more than 50,000 potential foot soldiers have registered online</a> but his effect on the next election remains unclear. Other third-party campaigning examples include the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/jun/27/coalition-hiding-plans-for-industrial-relations-reform-say-unions\">unions\u2019 campaign against WorkChoices</a>, the <a href=\"http://www.abc.net.au/news/2012-04-13/miners-launch-ads-amid-fear-of-losing-tax-concessions/3947588\">mining industry\u2019s against the mining tax</a>, or the <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/paying-the-piper-and-calling-the-tune-following-clubsnsws-political-donations-60639\">clubs\u2019 campaign against poker machine reform.</a></p> <p>Williams says while a ban on third parties would probably not work, limiting their contributions is possible.</p> <p>\u201cThe key here is to bring about a regime that creates a fair and level playing field,\u201d Williams said. \u201cTo ban third parties from participating in this way in the process would likely be invalid, but on the other hand appropriate limits and caps could be imposed.\u201d</p> <p>Twomey also says the high court would be likely to strike down laws banning third parties from campaigning. </p> <p>\u201cHowever, placing caps on their campaign expenditure would probably be valid, as long as the caps were not so low that they could not reasonably participate in political communication,\u201d said Twomey.</p> <p>Orr says regulating \u201cthird parties\u201d is only fair, even though it is complex.</p> <p>\u201cBut it is constitutionally OK provided the caps are reasonable and the regulated \u2018election period\u2019 is not too broad,\u201d Orr said. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/sep/09/abbott-joins-call-for-ban-on-donations-from-unions-and-corporations\">Abbott joins call for ban on political donations from unions and corporations</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cThis \u2018period\u2019 is harder to fix without a fixed election date nationally but the UK manages it.\u201d</p> <h2>Put a lid on it</h2> <p>If there is a clear consensus on political donations, it is around limits on funding rather than outright bans.</p> <p>Twomey says upholding caps on donations is important because \u201cit is hard to acquire influence if your donation is only as valuable as that of hundreds or thousands of others\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cOne effective way of lessening or eliminating undue influence through donations is by capping it at a relatively low level ($5,000 in NSW) so that the donation of a large company or union of $5,000 is worth the same as the donation of any individual or small business of $5,000,\u201d Twomey says.</p> <p>Williams says for this complex area of law, there is a clear way through which will produce an effective and legally viable regime to regulate political donations. </p> <p>\u201cThe answer is not to ban corporate and union donors, but to limit donations from all sources to a reasonable level, say $5,000,\u201d Williams said. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The answer is not to ban corporate and union donors, but to limit donations from all sources to a reasonable level</p> <footer> <cite>George Williams</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cThis would limit the ability of any donor to exercise undue influence. It is possible to ban certain donors, but only where it can be shown that there is a danger that donations from that source may corrupt or otherwise damage the political process.\u201d </p> <p>Facts, says Orr, more facts and basic principles.</p> <p>\u201cMost of all, we need a discussion of principles \u2013 the need to balance equality, integrity and liberty whilst resourcing politics,\u201d says Orr.</p> <p>\u201cAnd then modelling of the effect on different sides of politics, and of the need for extra public funding. The freedom of association of Labor/unions is a big hurdle for bipartisan reform here. And while public funding is \u2018clean\u2019 money, taxpayers have to be convinced the medicine is needed.\u201d</p>",

  "<p>With terrific warmth and idealism \u2013 and irresistible storytelling relish \u2013 director Amma Asante gives us a romantic true story from our dowdy postwar past. And with some style and wit, she even revives the spirit and showmanship of Richard Attenborough, who I think would have really enjoyed this gutsy movie.</p> <p>It\u2019s a tale of star-crossed lovers with the bigoted British government playing a particularly shabby and nasty House Of Capulet: a story of imperialism, bully-ism, and Westminster functionaries passing off their taboo horror of interracial marrying as a matter of realism and political expediency.</p> <p>With screenwriter Guy Hibbert, Asante has recovered a long-forgotten chapter of Britain\u2019s history which deserves an airing. And Rosamund Pike and David Oyelowo give beguiling performances as a white woman and black African man who fall in love. There\u2019s an openness and ingenuous quality to the two leads which is never slushy. And given that we are elsewhere entitled to suspect de facto apartheid in Hollywood, when it comes to the issue of casting romantic leads, Asante, Pike and Oyelowo make it look easy and necessary.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/video/2016/aug/25/a-united-kingdom-trailer-interracial-marriage-causes-outrage-in-true-story-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/5x97b\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2683649\"            data-video-name=\"A United Kingdom trailer: interracial marriage causes outrage in true story \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"guardian.co.uk\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-57bedbcfe4b0fe30498a4a41\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/08/25/160825AUnitedKingdom_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/08/25/160825AUnitedKingdom.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/08/25/160825AUnitedKingdom_WebM.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/video/2016/aug/25/a-united-kingdom-trailer-interracial-marriage-causes-outrage-in-true-story-video\">A United Kingdom trailer: interracial marriage causes outrage in true story</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>Oyelowo plays Seretse Khama, a young man in London in 1947 studying law; he is fact a prince of Bechuanaland (now Botswana), a British protectorate which effectively submits to imperial rule \u2013 via a native tribal council \u2013 in return for security and stability. But while in London, Seretse falls hard for Ruth Williams (played by Pike) a gawky, lonely young woman employed as a typist. They get married and propose returning in uxorious triumph to his homeland \u2013 to the horror of the people of Bechuanaland, who are suspicious of a haughty white queen and Her Majesty\u2019s government, who are terrified that South Africa will take this marriage as a provocative affront and left-ist incitement on its doorstep and could possibly retaliate by leaving the Commonwealth and depriving Britain of its gold and strategic minerals.</p> <p>So the smug bigwigs \u2013 played by Jack Davenport and Tom Felton \u2013 react to this cause-c\u00e9l\u00e8bre by doing everything they can to destroy the marriage, to undermine Khama\u2019s legitimacy and keep the couple apart: an ordeal which requires Khama to be in long exile in London, while Ruth remains behind in Africa as a kind of hostage. Asante shows that Britain, in cringing to Bechuanaland\u2019s overweening neighbour, was effectively attempting to revive two queasy spectres from prewar life: appeasement and abdication.</p> <p>Oyelowo brings to the role something of the same stillness and poise that he showed as Martin Luther King, but in this context it means something slightly different. Opposite a woman with whom he is in love, his reticence is more human, more obviously romantic. As for Pike, the fact that she is tall makes her interestingly of equal height with her lead, a pleasing visual approximation of their equal partnership in this morganatic marriage. She has a great moment in their early days of courtship when her sister Muriel (Laura Carmichael) excitedly reads the note he has just sent, inviting Ruth to a dance and saying he could get an extra ticket if she would like to take her sister too. \u201cBut I wouldn\u2019t like to take you!\u201d sighs Ruth in an ecstasy of romantic certainty.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a675a0c5eab50ddd782e45c8e998a64e3d669bb0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a675a0c5eab50ddd782e45c8e998a64e3d669bb0/0_24_780_468/500.jpg\" alt=\"United Kingdom\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>She is all too obviously ill at ease in her first encounter with her husband\u2019s (and in fact her own) subjects. Asante creates a horrendous moment of black comedy when she figures she should ape the style of young Princess Elizabeth and actually attempts doing an appallingly misjudged gloved wave while going shopping.</p> <p>Meanwhile, on the home front, there is nothing but duplicity and incompetence. Prime Minister Clement Attlee is merely peevish and resentful, apparently unable to stand up to South Africa\u2019s veiled threat. As for Winston Churchill, he is slippery on the subject \u2013 though if I have a quarrel here, it is that Asante and Hibbert decline to show Winston on screen, perhaps out of sentimental superstition that Churchill can only be depicted in a positive context.</p> <p>It is part of the poignancy and anguish of this couple\u2019s story that they are kept apart. But even when apart, or especially when apart, Oyelowo and Pike have chemistry, a rather British chemistry \u2013 their relationship convinces, perhaps just because of how restrained and decorous it mostly is. And Khama\u2019s exile is an echo of the imprisonment that other African leaders would suffer.</p> <p>Maybe any biopic risks na\u00efvet\u00e9 in suggesting the agony of postwar Africa can be soothed by a love story about a handsome prince. But this movie has candour, heartfelt self-belief, and an unfashionable conviction that love conquers all - though not immediately.</p> <p>\u2022 A United Kingdom opens the London film festival on 5 October and is released in the Australia on 10 November and the UK on 25 November</p>",
  "<p>The Rabbits, written by Kate Miller-Heidke and adapted from a picture book by John Marsden and Shaun Tan, was one of the most popular shows to run at this year\u2019s Sydney festival. The production, which debuted at Perth international arts festival in 2015, promised to bring the book to life with spectacular staging and costumes that would bring a third dimension to Tan\u2019s illustrations and characters. Everybody raved about it.

As a musician and writer, I have a particular interest in theatre and have welcomed the increase in audio-described theatre available in Australia. With descriptions, people like me can engage with and sometimes get lost in the work on stage. Sometimes we\u2019re backstage before a show begins, touching the props and costumes. </p> <p>I wouldn\u2019t be able to see The Rabbits, but on 21 January \u2013 late in the season \u2013 I was able to enjoy it. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2d193c398d0211bf67ea7be2cf2d97ae5d977c95\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2d193c398d0211bf67ea7be2cf2d97ae5d977c95/0_0_4832_3216/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Rabbits at Sydney Festival in 2016\" width=\"1000\" height=\"666\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018The marsupials\u2019 costumes were softer ... zippered like a coat and trousers\u2019: The Rabbits at the 2016 Sydney festival.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jon Green</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The Rabbits is an allegorical tale of colonisation told from both sides as a group of marsupials (described as \u201cnumbat-like creatures\u201d) have their world invaded by the arrival of the rabbits. The tactile tour organised by Sydney festival was led by the stage manager, Garry Alcorn, who guided a group of us as we touched and held some of what would be appearing on stage.</p> <p>Garry showed us a long pole with a flag on one end and a gun on the other which the rabbits planted on the ground to mark their territories. We felt the rabbit captain\u2019s costume too: a gargantuan top hat with brass studs, gold medallion and trim. Around the sides were plastic clockwork cogs; the 17th century navy coat was transformed to a stiff boat-shaped contraption around the torso, complete with trimmings and gold buttons. The preshow notes, which are given to vision-impaired people before the show, explained the black coat was full of white indecipherable calligraphy, just like the illustration in the book. </p> <p>The marsupials\u2019 costumes were softer, more comfortable two-pieces which could be zippered like a coat and trousers. Last, Garry passed around a baby \u2013 the show\u2019s most important element. It felt like a soft toy animal and had a long tail that fitted snugly around the neck. The end of the tail had a small hook to attach it to kites as they flew out of the reach of the marsupial mothers. </p> <p>During the performance I listened through an earpiece as an audio describer talked me through what was happening on stage \u2013 the movement of the actors, the changes of scene, any other visual cues that were important to the show. Audio describers are usually volunteers trained by Vision Australia, who I work with sometimes; they prepare the preshow notes, and with meticulous timing, feed in the information during gaps between dialogue.</p> <p>Michael Ward is the national coordinator of audio description at Vision Australia. The service, he says, enables people who are blind or have low vision to access the rich elements on offer onstage, helping them be more in the moment than they are when they have to do the extra work of deciphering as well as listening. It also helps place scenes in context and \u201censures you are not the only one in the room not laughing at the sight gag\u201d, he says. </p> <p>Belvoir St Theatre\u2019s production of Stephen Sewell\u2019s The Blind Giant is Dancing was audio-described on 12 March, but I attended an earlier performance too. I was struck by how different the play was the second time around.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"37223d286fde4e6eb56caf20dd358044ce0cf5d0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/37223d286fde4e6eb56caf20dd358044ce0cf5d0/0_0_6496_3840/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Yael Stone and Dan Spielman in a promo shot from Belvoir\u2019s 2016 production of the Blind Giant Is Dancing\" width=\"1000\" height=\"591\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Yael Stone and Dan Spielman in a promo shot from Belvoir\u2019s 2016 production of The Blind Giant Is Dancing.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Brett Boardman/Belvoir St Theatre</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Without audio description, the core interest was the dialogue between the main characters: an enraged progressive (Alan played by Dan Spielman), a stubborn feminist (his wife Louise played by his real-life partner Yael Stone), sinister journalist Rose and a controlling magnate. One of the first scenes features an argument between Alan and Louise, and at first, I sided with Alan, in the throes of a midlife crisis with Louise just not listening to him. But with audio description, I learned that Louise kept coming to Alan\u2019s side during their fight, trying to hold him before being rebuffed. I sympathised more with her that time.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2016/feb/16/tv-stars-yael-stone-and-dan-spielman-on-bringing-their-marriage-to-belvoirs-stage\">Orange Is The New Black's Yael Stone brings her marriage to Belvoir's stage</a> </p> </aside>  <p>With audio description, movement on stage becomes part of the drama instead of just background noise. In Belvoir\u2019s production of Blind Giant, the sets changed rapidly with little sound; the seeing audience was notified of the move by a flashing screen of text that dominated the stage. Alan could be at home, at his workplace or at a bar having a drink with Rose. Without description, all I got was a jumble of loosely connected chatter with few clues from the script or accompanying sounds. I had to guess where scenes were set \u2013 the local council? The Labour party campaign office? Alan\u2019s office? And where did Alan work? The Institute of Applied Economics in Redfern was stated numerous times on the screen but no one on stage mentioned it. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>With audio description, movement on stage becomes part of the drama instead of just background noise</p> <footer> <cite>Ria Andriani</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Knowing it was in Redfern upon second viewing, I could picture some of the local bars where Alan would meet with Rose. We were told the names of each character as they appeared on stage, too \u2013 helpful when actors are playing more than one character.</p> <p>Jill Gavin, the audio describer for The Blind Giant is Dancing, explained her preparation: \u201cI watch the play three times, once in the audience and twice more in a separate space. At Belvoir the audio describers sit in the green room and watch the show on a video feed.\u201d </p> <p>Gavin uses the scripted stage direction and director\u2019s comments to write preshow notes and fills in the rest with extra information, such as what individual characters look like, what they wear and what they are doing in the spaces between the script. By summarising the scenes one or two pages in advance, Gavin can time her description on cue. This is important: a description must be to the point and not superfluous.</p> <p>As a blind theatregoer, knowing the context and physical detail of the performance makes a great deal of difference to our experience. Tactile tour and audio description services add new layers of information and help us appreciate the complexity of live performance and the richness of our local creative culture.

But this week in Flushing Meadows, he\u2019s making a different kind of history. Injuries to Jiri Vesely\u2019s forearm, Mikhail Youzhny\u2019s hamstring and Jo-Wilfried Tsonga\u2019s knee made Djokovic the first men\u2019s player in the Open Era to reach a grand slam semi-final following three retirements and/or walkovers. Djokovic\u2019s nine sets and 84 games completed are the fewest en route to a semi at any major in the Open era that featured a 128 draw and only best-of-five set matches. Should Djokovic win his third US Open, the numbers to beat belong to John McEnroe, who played 16 sets and 150 games to secure his first major title at the 1979 US Open.</li> </ul> </ul> <ul> <ul> <li>Djokovic\u2019s opponent on Friday, No10 seed Ga\u00ebl Monfils, has enjoyed a smooth road of his own to the semi-finals. Monfils is the 10th player in the last 25 years to reach the US Open semi-finals without dropping a set. However, eight of the previous nine players did not win the title, and no US Open champion during the Open era has ever had a perfect set record. The bad omens only start there for Monfils, who is 0-12 against Djokovic dating back to the 2005 US Open. Both 18 years old at the time, Monfils and Djokovic engaged a five-set, first-round match that lasted four hours and two minutes. Djokovic overcame shoulder pain and cramps to win 7-5, 4-6, 7-6(5), 0-6, 7-5.<br></li> </ul> </ul> <ul> <ul> <li>Monfils\u2019 four-set loss to Roger Federer at 2008 Roland Garros started a string of eight straight defeats suffered by Frenchmen in grand slam semi-finals. Djokovic was responsible for two of those losses, beating Tsonga at 2011 Wimbledon and Richard Gasquet at 2015 Wimbledon as part of his 53-1 run against French opponents. Currently, Djokovic has won 16 straight matches overall against Frenchmen and 22 in a row at grand slam tournaments. </li> </ul> </ul> <p>Plenty more to come from Flushing Meadows. Hopefully we\u2019ll get a full match!</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57d302e5e4b08465d44ff126\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-09T18:45:03.711Z\">7.45pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><em>Bryan will be here shortly.

The outcome cost Williams not only a chance at a history-making 23rd grand slam title to eclipse Steffi Graf\u2019s professional-era mark for major championships but also the No1 ranking that she\u2019s held since February 2013 \u2013 a span of 186 weeks that equaled Graf\u2019s record for consecutive weeks on top.</p> <p>It marks the second straight year Williams has fallen at the penultimate hurdle in a bid for history at the season-ending major.

  "<p>His goal was simple, he told authorities. He was hoping to protect his pregnant fiancee from a violent ex-boyfriend.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>There was just one, rather formidable, obstacle in his way: the Canada-US border.</p> <p>The solution devised by the 25-year-old American \u2013 floating down a river that separates the two countries on an inflatable mattress to illegally enter Canada \u2013 was ingenious, but it led this week to a two-month jail sentence. </p> <p>The American, identified as John Bennett by a crown prosecutor, first tried to legally cross the border between Calais, Maine, and the Canadian province of New Brunswick on Wednesday. He told authorities he wanted to see his girlfriend who lived in Canada, in the small town of St Stephen. He was denied entry after a background check turned up pending mischief charges in the US. </p> <p>Hours later he headed to his local Walmart, a court in Canada heard on Thursday. He bought an air mattress, inflated it, fashioned a wooden board into a paddle and set sail on the St Croix river, a tidal river 500 yards wide that sits between Maine and New Brunswick. </p> <p>As he floated along the river, he was spotted by a local resident who called the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, said Peter Thorn, a lawyer representing the public prosecution service of Canada. The RCMP headed to the area and found him soon after. \u201cHe was wet and carrying his boots and matched the description that the witness had given,\u201d said Thorn. </p> <p>The young man immediately admitted to police that, driven by concerns over his girlfriend\u2019s safety, he had crossed the river after being denied legal entry to Canada. \u201cHe, in his mind, thought he needed to do what needed to be done to get over there to see her and ensure that she was OK,\u201d said Thorn. \u201cBut there has not been any corroboration on the so-called fiancee\u2019s side of the story, meaning we don\u2019t know the accuracy of what he was saying.\u201d </p> <p>He was arrested and held in police custody overnight. During a court appearance on Thursday, he pleaded guilty to failing to appear at a border crossing. Bennett, who has no fixed address but is believed to reside in Calais, Maine, was sentenced to two months in jail in Canada, after which he will be returned to the United States. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/22/canada-us-migrants-float-down-coast-guard\">Canada halts wave of accidental US migrants as water-borne party goes awry</a> </p> </aside>  <p>While this was the first time he had heard of someone making the crossing by air mattress, Thorn had had other cases where people had crossed the border by swimming or crossing the railway bridge. Some were people who refused to recognise land borders, others suffered mental health problems. \u201cAnd there are other people who are overcome with desire to come across even though they have been rebuffed at the border, for whatever reason,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t think this is the only case of a so-called love interest that has caused a person to break the law to go over there.\u201d</p> <p>Still, the reaction to the case has surprised him. Some swooned over the gallantry of the act, with Thorn overhearing one person remark that they wished someone would carry out such an act for them. \u201cI sense that there\u2019s this element of a Romeo-Juliet type of thing. I think that\u2019s part of it.\u201d </p> <p>Others delighted in the idea of floating along the tidal river, said Thorn, such as the judge who told the accused in court, \u201cPardon the pun, but it seems to me you wanted to get there, come hell or high water.\u201d </p> <p> </p>",

However, the team were dissuaded from going through with it because of the potential repercussions, according to Smith.</p> <p>\u201cBefore one of the derbies in the 2015-16 season, the Sunderland players asked an agent to produce a T-shirt depicting a black cat savaging a magpie,\u201d he writes. \u201cThey were going to wear it under their kit during the game and at full-time, presuming they won, all take their tops off and run towards Newcastle supporters showing off these T-shirts.</p> <p>\u201cIn the overall scheme of things, who cares? They aren\u2019t necessarily breaking the law but in football emotion runs so high it could create a disturbance or even a riot. And in that riot, if one child gets hurt, it is appalling. If one child dies, it is a tragedy. That\u2019s what we have to contend&#xa0;with.</p> <p>\u201cIt took that agent six days to talk the Sunderland squad out of it. He told them they would be fined hundreds of thousands of pounds but they didn\u2019t care; there is at least something to be said for players being so impassioned by the cause that a financial punishment did not deter them, especially given the prevailing perception of footballers being driven solely by money. Here was the antithesis \u2013 they wanted to sacrifice money in a public show of hunger to avoid relegation.\u201d</p> <p>Sunderland\u2019s version of events is that there was only one player involved and it was said in jest, but Smith told the Guardian: \u201cThis is one of those circumstances where it was between the players and the agent, rather than the club.\u201d</p>",

The Samoan\u2019s sending-off after 62 minutes, for leading with his elbow, gave the Cherry and Whites a timely lifeline and extended the Warriors\u2019 sequence of Premiership outings without a win to six games.</p> <p>Carl Hogg, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/sep/04/harlequins-bristol-saracens-worcester-mo-farah\" title=\"\">the Worcester coach, </a>had little doubt \u201cthe red card changed the outcome of the game\u201d after the television match official ruled Fa\u2019osiliva had illegally flattened the Argentine lock Mariano Galarza. First-half tries from Ben Te\u2019o and Cooper Vuna and a spectacular effort from 21-year-old replacement Perry Humphreys might still have seen the hosts safely home, only for final-quarter tries from Matt Scott and Henry Purdy, both converted by Greig Laidlaw, to drag Gloucester level at a stadium where they had not won since 2010.</p> <p>Gloucester\u2019s modest record on Worcester turf had little bearing on this occasion. This was the first league game on the Warriors\u2019 new artificial pitch, a stretch of green sufficiently flat and manicured to put the cricket square at New Road to shame. The downside was a stadium so dimly lit it resembled an old-school training night on a remote third-team back pitch. When the electronic scoreboard also gave up the ghost it really did feel as if a nearby meter needed feeding. The digital advertising hoardings were comfortably the most luminous thing in the ground, which might have been the subtle intention all along.</p> <p>What the Warriors badly needed after their sizeable opening weekend defeat to Saracens was a brighter performance on the field. Gloucester looked the sharper initially, Charlie Sharples having a possible try ruled out for not releasing in a tackle just short of the line, but Worcester gradually slowed the game down to a more manageable pace and began to exert some territorial control.</p> <p>It paid dividends when scrum-half Jonny Arr nipped in behind the defensive line to create a chance out wide gratefully taken by the powerful England squad centre, Te\u2019o. With 31 minutes gone and advantage being played an increasingly confident Worcester scored again, Vuna finishing strongly in the corner despite suspicions of a forward pass in the buildup. Gloucester\u2019s night took another turn for the worse when their barnstorming Welsh back-rower Ross Moriarty was knocked cold and had to be replaced. Losing to Leicester having led 31-7 was clearly a bitter disappointment and basic handling errors compounded their frustration in front of the watching England head coach Eddie Jones.</p> <p>When their passing clicks they have a backline with enviable pace and elusiveness but the maddening inconsistency that has dogged them for years shows little sign of disappearing. A good angled penalty from Ryan Lamb, to add to his earlier conversion, extended the Warriors\u2019 half-time advantage to nine points and left the visitors with a Malvern-sized hill to climb.</p> <p>Laidlaw did claw three points back immediately after the break but, despite a concussed Te\u2019o failing to reappear, Worcester did not appear initially flustered. Any sense of complacency, however, disappeared with Fa\u2019osiliva, who will consider himself a touch unfortunate to have been red-carded for simply carrying the ball into contact.</p> <p>Worcester\u2019s tight forwards did their best to take no notice, making a mess of Gloucester\u2019s scrum on a couple of occasions. Lamb will rue a penalty attempt that bounced away off a post but the athletic Humphreys will long remember his try in the left corner, shrugging off three tacklers en route. Gloucester, though, hit back at the start of the final quarter with a smart try from Scott from Mark Atkinson\u2019s inside ball before conceding a stupid penalty for offside. From dim wattage to dim-witted, so to speak, only for Purdy and Laidlaw to flick the switch back to neutral.</p> <p><strong>Worcester</strong> Willison; Hammond, Olivier, Te\u2019o (Humphreys, h-t), Vuna; Lamb (Heathcote, 62), Arr; Ruskin (Leileimalefaga, 62), Annett (Bregvadze, 64) Johnston (Daniels, 71) O\u2019Callaghan, Barry (Scotland-Williamson, 71) Fa\u2019osilivia, Mama, Dowson (capt).</p> <p><strong>Tries</strong> Te\u2019o, Vuna, Humphreys.<strong> Con </strong>Lamb.<strong> Pens</strong> Lamb, Heathcote.</p> <p><strong>Red card</strong> Fa\u2019osilivia 52.</p> <p><strong>Gloucester</strong> Marshall; Sharples, Scott, Twelvetrees (Atkinson, 47), Purdy; B Burns, Laidlaw (capt); Thomas (Orr, 62), Hibbard, Afoa, Savaga, Galarza, Moriarty (Rowan, 32), Kvesic, Morgan.</p> <p><strong>Tries </strong>Scot, Purdy. <strong>Cons</strong> Laidlaw 2. <strong>Pens</strong> Laidlaw 3.</p> <p><strong>Referee</strong> L Pearce</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/behind-the-lines/2016/sep/09/rugby-ian-mckinley-blind-one-eye-treviso-leinster\">A stray boot blinded Ian McKinley in one eye but he's back playing top-level rugby</a> </p> </aside> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2016/sep/09/richmond-london-irish-championship-rugby\">Richmond at London Irish a reminder of Premiership promise and unfairness | Robert Kitson</a> </p> </aside>",

Not only will parliament spend the next four years, at least, making real Farage\u2019s dream of a British exit from the European Union, we now know it will also be consumed with another Farage obsession: the return of the grammar school.

He insisted they stop \u201cbanging on about Europe\u201d and abandon their nostalgic longing for grammar schools. His successor has now decreed her government will devote itself to little else.</p> <p>For a while there was a school of optimistic, remain-voting thought that saw May as a secret ally. It held that she was delaying <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/25/article-50-brexit-debate-britain-eu\" title=\"\">article 50</a> because she privately knows Brexit is bonkers; by appointing her three Brexiteers \u2013 Boris Johnson, David Davis and Liam Fox \u2013 she was setting them up to fail; she would eventually persuade her party and the country to see sense and accept a Brexit that didn\u2019t quite mean Brexit. In this rose-coloured view, the grammar school promise was a lump of pre-emptive red meat, lobbed early to the Tory backbenches to placate them for the European disappointment to come.</p> <p>But now that we\u2019ve heard the speech, her first policy address as PM, we should junk that view. It\u2019s time to accept that May means it, at least when it comes to education. She\u2019s a believer. Note that back in 2000, when she was shadow education secretary, she was <a href=\"https://twitter.com/rosschawkins/status/774150436399886336\" title=\"\">sticking up for grammars</a>, praising them for providing \u201copportunity irrespective of family means or background\u201d. With May, we should probably get used to taking things at face value: there may be no hidden meanings.</p> <p>Which is not to say that May\u2019s move today was without politics. It had plenty and not all of it designed to tickle the tummy of Tory backwoodsmen. There was a renewed play for those Ed Miliband called the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/jan/14/ed-miliband-squeezed-middle-class\" title=\"\">squeezed middle</a>, Britons not poor enough to get all-encompassing state help but \u201cjust managing\u201d to get by, on a household income of between \u00a316,000 and \u00a321,000 a year. Strikingly, May referred nine times to \u201cordinary, working class people\u201d, embracing an explicit language of class always avoided by Tony Blair and Gordon Brown (they preferred \u201chard-working families\u201d.) And though the grammars proposal got all the attention, May announced other steps aimed at boosting meritocracy, including demands that private schools do more for the deprived if they are to keep their advantageous tax status \u2013 an idea <a href=\"http://blogs.spectator.co.uk/2016/09/theresa-may-makes-grammar-schools-pitch/?utm_source=Adestra&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=Lunchtime_Espresso_09092016\" title=\"\">lifted directly from Miliband\u2019s 2015 manifesto</a>.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/video/2016/sep/09/theresa-may-education-shakeup-to-make-uk-a-great-meritocracy-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/52a4p\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2703994\"            data-video-name=\"Theresa May: education shakeup to make UK a 'great meritocracy' \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"ITN\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-57d2b04ee4b013613fffb9da\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/09/09/160909mayprivate_KP-29237717_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/09/09/160909mayprivate_KP-29237717_WebM.webm\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/09/09/160909mayprivate_KP-29237717.m3u8\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/video/2016/sep/09/theresa-may-education-shakeup-to-make-uk-a-great-meritocracy-video\">Theresa May: education shakeup to make UK a \u201cgreat meritocracy\u201d - video</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>Any defence of May would note all this and add that the Tory desire to revive grammar schools is usually well intentioned. It might rest on nostalgia, but it\u2019s nostalgia for an era when social mobility was real, a period from the 1940s to the 1960s when doors were opened to bright working-class children that had previously been closed. True, this <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/08/the-guardian-view-on-grammar-schools-the-wrong-answer-but-the-right-question\" title=\"\">misreads the history somewhat: social mobility</a> was expanding for myriad reasons then, from the explosion in white-collar jobs to the equalising effect of the war. But to hanker for such an expansion in life chances is not, in itself, to be condemned.</p> <p>So let\u2019s assume that those who advocate the return of grammar schools do so in good faith. The argument rests on two questions. Is selection purely on academic merit desirable? And, if it is, is it even possible?</p> <p>On the first, it\u2019s always going to be hard for me to denounce selective education. It\u2019s not the schooling my children are getting \u2013 as it happens, they\u2019ve only ever gone to nonselective state schools \u2013 but it is the education I had, and benefited from, at a fee-paying school. Indeed, I am that rare creature in the London liberal commentariat: I send my kids to state schools but (occasionally) feel guilty about it \u2013 because I worry they might not be getting the opportunities I had. Paul Mason puts it well when, recalling his own experience in Bolton, he describes grammar schools as, at their best, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/08/grammar-schools-arent-fit-for-the-world-of-the-future\" title=\"\">\u201cintellectual hothouses bringing working-class kids to the world of ideas and debate\u201d.</a> I went to a London public school so the composition was different, but the hothouse bit, the ideas and debate, I recognise \u2013 and to pretend that had nothing to do with academic selection is dishonest.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/08/grammar-schools-arent-fit-for-the-world-of-the-future\">Grammar schools aren\u2019t fit for the world of the future | Paul Mason</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But the issue is not whether selection is good for those who get selected. The rawer problem is who gets chosen. If we could be confident that every place in one of May\u2019s new grammars went to a kid whose parents could never afford to go private, or live near a top state school, that would be one thing. But we know it won\u2019t be like that. We know it will be sharp-elbowed, affluent parents armed with cultural and social capital who will get their kids in. Experience tells us there\u2019s no such thing as a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2014/oct/14/fairer-school-admissions-scrap-selection\" title=\"\">\u201ctutor-proof\u201d admission test</a>, that prep schools will coach their pupils to pass, just as they\u2019ve always done and do now. Note that in the grammar schools that exist today, just <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2013/nov/08/grammar-schools-admit-more-privately-educated-children\" title=\"\">3% of pupils are on free school meals</a>, when the national average is 18%. They are enclaves of the successful middle class.</p> <p>And this is not to condemn those parents, incidentally. One of the deformities of our education debate is that we conduct it as if it were a matter of personal morality, judging parents for the ethics of their choice. But most human beings will always seek the very best education for their children, and that\u2019s perfectly natural. Rather than faulting and judging individual behaviour, we need to devise a system that works for the collective good.</p> <p>Which brings us to the second key problem with selection. Even if May somehow did achieve the impossible, and ensured admission went only to the brightest and most needy, that would still leave the matter of all those who do not get in. She insists that there will be no return to the \u201cbinary\u201d choice of old, but there is no way around it. Selection means some are selected and some are not.</p> <p>Sure, she\u2019ll ensure the non-grammars won\u2019t be called secondary moderns. There\u2019ll be some new, \u201cinclusive\u201d name for them. But everyone will know.</p> <p>May says none of this will matter, because these days there\u2019s such a range of schools, many of which are flourishing: faith schools, academies and the like. But those schools have done well, in London especially, partly because there is no stigma attached to them, no question that they are for \u201crejects\u201d. The proof comes in the presence of a good number of bright, committed pupils. But if the clever kids in every town are creamed off, suddenly those other schools won\u2019t look quite so shiny or appealing. There\u2019ll be the grammar school and the rest, just as in the old days.</p> <p>May is right to want a system where even the poorest child can get a world-class education. But no matter how rosy her memories, she\u2019s looking in the wrong place.</p>",
  "<p>With so many passions aroused in Europe by the impact of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/refugees\" title=\"\">refugee crisis</a>, rising populism, fear of terrorism, not to mention confused debates over secularism and burkinis, exploring what European Muslims think has arguably never been more important. One interesting figure is the grand mufti of Slovenia who I met at a recent conference in Austria, held by the International Peace Institute. Slovenia is a predominantly Catholic country of two million people \u2013 among them, an estimated 50,000 Muslims. The country\u2019s first mosque is currently under construction in the capital, Ljubljana. Building it required the overcoming of many political and administrative hurdles \u2013 these were eventually cleared when Slovenia\u2019s constitutional court ruled that denying a minority the right to a place of worship ran counter to religious freedoms. Unsurprisingly, Grand Mufti Nezad Grabus thinks these are difficult times for Muslims in Europe. They constantly have to fend off suspicions of links with radical Islamism or terrorism.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/08/muslim-woman-kicked-off-american-airlines-flight-islamophobia\">I didn't realize how often Muslims get kicked off planes, until it happened to me</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Grabus is a quiet, smiling man in his late 40s. If there is one thing he wants to stress, it is that \u201cIslam is part of European civilisation\u201d. Islam is by no means a new religion in Europe, \u201cbut it has new manifestations\u201d, he says. He was shocked by this summer\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/19/nice-becomes-latest-french-city-to-impose-burkini-ban\" title=\"\">burkini ban</a> in some French seaside resorts, and he\u2019s bluntly opposed to any legislation outlawing the niqab. But he also says the niqab is something European Muslims must work to counter, because it prevents Muslim women from finding a rightful place in society. Grabus was born in the Bosnian town of Travnik (his father later moved the family to Slovenia where he\u2019d found work, when it was part of communist Yugoslavia). He is a Balkan Muslim. Islam certainly isn\u2019t new in the Balkans, a region that was dominated for centuries by the Ottoman empire.</p> <p>Just as Europe is a patchwork of cultures and nations, Europe\u2019s Muslim populations are extremely diverse, as is their history. This may sound obvious, but it\u2019s something that gets easily pushed aside in all the heated debates about Islam, migration and identity politics. Muslims tend to get lumped together as a single entity. \u201cIn Europe, we Muslims have to acknowledge that we have no common narrative,\u201d says the mufti, \u201cthere are many differences.\u201d For example, he points to how ethnic characteristics play a more important role than many observers realise. Muslims can relate as much to their ethnic or national roots (Bosnian, Albanian, Turkish, Kurdish, Algerian, Pakistani etc) as they do to their religious beliefs. Religious revival, as in any faith, doesn\u2019t mean you sweep away other parts of your identity.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>How many people know that the first mosque in France was built by the French secular republic (in Paris, in the 1920s)?</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>But that\u2019s not to say there can\u2019t be a \u201ccommon narrative\u201d, and Grabus is adamant that: \u201cAs Muslims in Europe, our duty is to create one, in which we would expose our understanding of Islam belonging here.\u201d Much of this, he points out, has to do with education and overcoming ignorance, both among Muslims and non-Muslims. How many people, he asks, know that Austro-Hungary, under the Habsburgs, recognised Islam as an official religion as long ago as 1912? How many know that the first mosque in France was built by the secular French republic (in Paris, in the 1920s) as a tribute to the tens of thousands of Muslims who died in the first world war? And how many people are ready to consider that the medieval scholar Averroes, born in C\u00f3rdoba when Andaluc\u00eda was ruled by the Arabs, was a European Muslim?</p> <p>With all the current obsessing over terrorism and radicalisation, it\u2019s easy to forget about Europe\u2019s variety, and the diversity of its Muslim populations. Days after talking with Grabus, I was in Cologne, meeting representatives of the Turkish-Islamic Union for religious affairs (as part of a study group on Germany and the refugee crisis, organised by the Robert Bosch Foundation). The central mosque in Cologne is a beautiful, modern building with concrete and glass walls, and an Ottoman-styled dome. It is still under construction, and it stands as proof of some of the societal changes now under way.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/video/2016/sep/08/francois-hollande-islam-can-co-exist-with-a-french-secular-state-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/526q4\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2701651\"            data-video-name=\"Fran\u00e7ois Hollande: Islam can co-exist with a French secular state \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"AP\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-57d17b30e4b013613fffb500\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/09/08/160908hollande_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/09/08/160908hollande.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/09/08/160908hollande_WebM.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/video/2016/sep/08/francois-hollande-islam-can-co-exist-with-a-french-secular-state-video\">Fran\u00e7ois Hollande: Islam can co-exist with a French secular state</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>A million Muslims live in the German state of North Rhine-Westphalia \u2013 a third of Germany\u2019s three-million-strong Turkish community.

That has been the case in Norway and in Switzerland. That is clear.\u201d The proposal would be rejected outright by British Eurosceptics.</p> <p>He also gave no ground on <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jul/04/uk-could-access-single-market-suggests-french-presidential-favourite-alain-juppe\">free movement of EU workers</a>, saying any concessions that allowed the UK to exclude some EU citizens would lead to the disintegration of Europe.</p> <p>Macron\u2019s remarks are a fresh sign that leading French politicians jockeying for the presidency are in no mood to offer concessions to the UK.</p> <p>Macron,39, <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/30/frances-economy-minister-emmanuel-macron-resigns\">resigned from Hollande\u2019s unpopular government</a> last week, to set up new movement \u201cEn Marche\u201d and assemble his \u201cprogressive diagnosis\u201d of French ills ahead of a decision on a presidential bid in a couple of months.

Describing his position of third in the polls as \u201ca good beginning\u201d, he insists he can be the catalyst to disrupt and break the classical outmoded left-right political blocs.</p> <p>Macron\u2019s remarks on passporting run counter to claims made by both Philip Hammond, the chancellor and Boris Johnson, the foreign secretary, that passporting rights will be preserved. Hammond told MPs this week that any attempt by the EU to split off euro-denominated clearing would not benefit the EU, with business instead drifting to New York.</p> <p>Johnson has insisted the UK\u2019s financial services sector will not be stripped of the passporting rights, which exist within the single market, saying that the City of London will remain a global financial centre.</p> <p>But Macron said: \u201cWe have the eurozone. Could we accept to be cleared, regulated and de facto have inflows and outflows from a country that has decided to leave the EU? For me, definitely not.\u201d</p> <p>He added the EU could not wait months and months for the UK to start Brexit talks. \u201cProcrastination is not the right answer. We have to be extremely strict on the implementation of Brexit so there is a common approach between member states. We must avoid a sector by sector or country by country approach, and ask the UK to be clear.\u201d</p> <p>He also spurned the concessions on free movement as a price for access to the EU single market. \u201cIf you accept such caveats, the more you can damage the EU and it will be an open door for whoever has doubts about Europe, and so reduce the incentive to be pro-European. </p> <p>\u201cI was completely against the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2016/feb/17/four-eu-states-shun-camerons-benefits-plan-politics-live\">agreements signed with the UK in February</a>; it just said \u2018OK if you give me more, then I will stay in the club\u2019. That is the beginning of the dismantlement of Europe. Now just because there is a leave vote, should we rewrite the rules of the club for one country. It\u2019s a very strange defeat for Europe if people accept that.\u201d</p> <p>Macron said he is trying to develop a programme on economic dynamism, married to social protection, equality of opportunity and security: \u201cI am not just a liberal movement. I come from the progressive left.

A national debate on this was the best way to divide the country\u201d.</p> <p>He said that the middle classes were losing their sense of cultural security, but that issue could not be solved by national laws and bans.</p> <p>\u201cThe guy who killed people in Nice was not a Muslim. Daesh [Islamic State] want civil war in our country. They want to divide the country. But they are not in a position to break our country unless we decide to enter into this game and organise a civil war. It is crazy to think the best way to defeat Daesh is to fight Muslims. We have 5.5 million Muslims in France\u201d.</p> <p>But he said there was a deeper issue about unintegrated Muslims in France, especially Salafists who regarded Islamic law as superior to French secular law. He estimated that between 25\u201330% of French Muslims, close to 2 million, thought in this way, and the answer lay in enforcing French secular law.</p> <p>French Muslims had to become less dependent on preachers from Algiers and Morocco, he said. But he added that measures such as the burkini ban, or <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/apr/11/france-bans-burqa-and-niqab\">wearing the veil</a>, risked disenfranchising Muslims and risking their ability to be fully aligned with the Republic.</p>",
  "<p>I first met Louiza Patikas at a party a few years ago. It was too good an opportunity to pass up, so I cornered her to find out what she thought Helen Titchener, <a href=\"http://\">the character she plays in The Archers</a>, looked like. We all have our fixed visual ideas of radio people, at variance with others (\u201cNo way! She\u2019s dark!\u201d) and seldom borne out by the disappointing photographs that occasionally appear in the press. Patikas said then, and reiterates now, \u201cI think she\u2019s tall, rangy; she\u2019d have a long stride, thick blonde hair, very slim, a kind face, but quite pointy features, and tidily dressed, so probably jeans and a Boden top, farming office wear. She\u2019d always wear a watch \u2013 I\u2019ve never worn a watch in my life. She\u2019d look particularly good in blue. And she would use those beauty products you buy in health food shops, Weleda. I don\u2019t think we\u2019d go shopping together, or even to the same shops.\u201d</p> <p>Helen back then was a neurotic, highly strung pain in the neck, an organic cheesemaker with a history of anorexia and failed relationships. We were laughing at her for her humourlessness, her pained journey through life and her overbearing attitude to those who tried to thwart her. Then came the transformation into a tragic heroine. This week, Helen has been standing trial for the attempted murder of her husband Rob Titchener, an abusive practitioner of the new criminal offence of coercive control and \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/apr/05/the-archers-domestic-abuse-gaslighting-sanity-abusive-relationship\">gaslighting</a>\u201d \u2013 a form of psychological abuse in which a victim is manipulated into doubting their own memory, perception and sanity.</p> <p>On Tuesday, we heard Helen\u2019s tightly coiled vocal chords break down into a description of the serial rapes she had endured in her marriage. Patikas\u2019s performance has been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/apr/07/the-archers-review-week-in-radio\">universally praised</a> for its range, power and texture of emotions, which have left many listeners in tears. Why didn\u2019t she leave, fans have asked, and still ask of people in abusive relationships. Her performance on Tuesday made it clear: shame.</p> <p>Despite having played Helen for 16 years, Patikas, now 39 and facing a barrage of publicity, is virtually unknown. She doesn\u2019t have a Wikipedia entry and has never been recognised on the street. It is extremely difficult to find Helen in the shorter, pleasingly rounder, dark-haired woman with the Greek name, wearing a hot-orange, sheep-frightening Vivienne Westwood dress. When Patikas saw the <a href=\"http://\">drawings made of the fictional trial</a> by a real court artist, she said, \u201cShe hasn\u2019t been able to have her highlights done in prison, has she?\u201d And, \u201cSo that\u2019s what I\u2019d look like if I was thinner.\u201d Her lack of public profile is partly a result of her working only a few days a month on the Archers and focusing on bringing up her two sons, aged seven and five. She lives in a large basement flat in west London with her actor husband Jonathan Aris, who has appeared in Sherlock and Wolf Hall.</p> <p>On Sunday night, the trial concludes with a special one-hour episode, including the jury room deliberations, with jurors played by Eileen Atkins, Nigel Havers, Catherine Tate and, in an unusual twist of self-referentiality, Graham Seed, who in his incarnation as Nigel Pargetter <a href=\"http://\">fell from the roof to his death</a> during the 60th anniversary episode in 2011. Sunday\u2019s episode was recorded last Saturday, and when we met on Wednesday Patikas had only known Helen\u2019s fate for a few days, weeks after the trial recordings. Her mother had warned her to \u201cmanage her expectations\u201d and look for other work, in case Helen is found guilty and disappears to become a silent character in the prison system.</p> <p>Having played Helen since she left drama school 16 years ago, Patikas has lived with the abuse story in her head for the past three years: \u201cIt has been much like it has been for the audience, because they\u2019ve been through the same journey as I have with Helen. But it has been extraordinary, because \u2013 as much as we all knew it was a very powerful storyline \u2013 none of us anticipated the impact. I haven\u2019t just walked into a part, like the theatre. There\u2019s a huge backstory to Helen and her family, and to carry all the back knowledge into this has been really devastating.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"11903be1dc39f588622e95e2553c58b3f27c637b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/11903be1dc39f588622e95e2553c58b3f27c637b/0_0_3249_2094/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A BBC sketch of Helen in the dock, by a real courtroom artist\" width=\"1000\" height=\"645\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A BBC sketch of Helen in the dock, by a real courtroom artist.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Illustration: Julia Quenzler/BBC</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cIt\u2019s been very creatively rewarding, but I\u2019ve read scripts and thought, \u2018I don\u2019t want this to happen to her, I can\u2019t bear it.\u2019 One of the things that really struck me when I met a survivor of domestic abuse \u2013 and I met quite a few of them \u2013 was how her whole central nervous system was jangled and messed up, and although her story was very different to Helen\u2019s, this was the most valuable thing I learned. All your senses are incredibly acute \u2013 you hear and smell what you wouldn\u2019t normally, every noise is a potential threat.\u201d</p> <p>Patikas\u2019s father is Greek and her mother English. She lived in Athens until she was six, when her parents separated and she and her mother moved to Reigate. \u201cIt was Surrey all the way until the summers, when we spent every six weeks with my incredible Greek grandmother and my dad. My family come from a village in the Peloponnese which, when I was little, was very basic, and there were many parallels to Ambridge life \u2013 people living on and off the land, livelihoods being dependent on weather, bureaucracy and that fantastic thing of multi-generational living, constantly referencing the three or four generations before that.\u201d</p> <p>At home in Surrey, there was no Radio 4, and Patikas did not hear The Archers until she was in her late teens, while a passenger in a car that a friend was driving. \u201cIt was a regular journey over the summer and at the end of it I thought, \u2018This is completely brilliant,\u2019 and I was an occasional listener on and off after that. I knew who everybody was, but I didn\u2019t follow every story. When I got the part, I remember thinking in my naivety, \u2018This is the best day of my life, this is it, this is my dream job,\u2019 and I still think that today.\u201d</p> <p>Patikas\u2019s younger son started school this week, leaving her free for the first time to pursue other parts. Over the summer she has been filming the second series of the ITV drama Unforgotten, playing a pathologist. The outgoing editor of The Archers, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/may/07/archers-editor-sean-oconnor-helen-is-the-victim-but-she-shouldnt-have-stabbed-him\">Sean O\u2019Connor</a>, has recently taken the job of producer on EastEnders, and I speculate that he might like to take her with him. \u201cOh my goodness,\u201d she says, startled, \u201cI would never leave The Archers, though they might get rid of me. I can\u2019t quite see myself in Walford, but you never know. I would relish the opportunity to work with Sean in any way in the future.\u201d</p> <p>The recording of the night of the stabbing was different from anything Patikas had done before. \u201cIt was very emotional on every level,\u201d she says. \u201cYou can go in, do a fairly controlling scene with Rob and Helen, Tim [Watson, the actor who plays Rob] and I would be chatting beforehand, telling a few jokes, but this was a very different vibe right from the beginning. Tim Stimpson, the lead writer, was in the studio with us the whole time and that really helped with the focus, because it was big stuff to do.</p> <p>\u201cThere was a lot of choreographing of the actual stabbing, that was done separately with no emotions. Then the next scene after that was incredibly powerful also, because the scenes I\u2019d been doing for a year were largely just me and Tim in the studio, reflecting the isolation of Helen, and then suddenly there are many actors in the room with me, the paramedics and the police.\u201d</p> <p>Patikas\u2019s husband grew up with The Archers and remains a fan of the show. \u201cHe really likes Helen,\u201d she says, \u201cbecause she has never been written or performed in a way that\u2019s trying to be likeable. But he doesn\u2019t want to know what\u2019s going to happen, so he tries not to make eye contact in case he thinks he can read me. After the big stuff, I came back and was quite quiet, and said it had been absolutely exhausting and upsetting.\u201d</p> <p>Like the whole country, Patikas wants justice for Helen and damnation for Rob. \u201cI always said to Sean that I really hope it\u2019s a redemptive storyline, because we all need that at some point, but it\u2019s his call.\u201d In the end, though, it\u2019s out of her control.</p> <p><em>The hour-long special of The Archers, with jury deliberations and verdict, is on Radio 4 on 11 September at 7pm.</em><br></p> <h2>The key characters</h2> <p><em>Warning \u2013 contains details of this week\u2019s episodes</em></p> <p><strong>Helen<br></strong>Cheesemaker who began an affair with Rob after years of personal turmoil.

And with good reason. After years of educational reform \u2013 some of it wise, some of it not, most of it well-intentioned \u2013 England\u2019s school system is at last working pretty well. Record numbers of children attend schools rated good or outstanding. Failing schools have been turned round. Cities such as London and Birmingham, once bywords for underachievement, now have schools whose exam results are some of the best.</p> <p>Failings, problems and inequalities of course remain. Complacency would be fatal. Britain\u2019s record for social mobility is poor, for instance, and it has been made worse by post-crash inequalities. But the idea that English secondary schools are in crisis is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/sep/09/mays-grammar-school-plans-put-six-years-of-educational-progress-at-risk\" title=\"\">by any meaningful measure false</a>. To&#xa0;shake the system up yet again and without consultation, let alone for the most radical reform in half a century, and especially if the shake-up is designed to replace a comprehensive system with a selective alternative that was abandoned 50 years ago because it had failed, which the current system has not, is nuts.</p> <p>At which point, it is only right to pause and study what the prime minister actually said today. Her speech was wide-ranging. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/sep/09/theresa-may-grammar-schools-heart-of-conservative-thinking\" title=\"\">It wasn\u2019t even all about education</a>. She framed her proposals in the context of social and economic hardship, and the wish of people to get on in life. There is not only nothing wrong with that \u2013 it is also what everyone wants for themselves and their children. Nor can the focus on increasing social mobility be faulted in principle. Mrs May prefers to use the word meritocracy, but she did not pretend that all on the meritocratic ladder start from the same rung. She said she wants to put working-class people first. And she focused not just on the poorest of the working class but on the \u201chidden disadvantaged\u201d, whom she dubbed those who are \u201cjust about managing\u201d. <a href=\"http://www.suttontrust.com/newsarchive/sir-peter-lampl-responds-to-the-prime-ministers-education-speech/\" title=\"\">So far so good</a> \u2013 and so coherent.</p> <p>The problems start with the practical effects of what she proposed, and continue into the politics of what people on both sides of the political divide think she is saying. Mrs&#xa0;May set out a vision in which universities, fee-paying schools, and chains of academies invest in schools which can introduce academic selection for all or some of their courses. But there are few guarantees that this system will work in the way she believes and plenty of well-based worries that it will have the opposite effect to what she intends.</p> <p>The prime minister is adamant that this would not mean a return to the old binary system of the postwar era in which those who passed the 11-plus went on to good jobs and those who didn\u2019t (80% of the total) were given a second-class deal. But the politics of this speech are already outside Mrs May\u2019s control. A binary system benefiting the middle-class is exactly what many in her party have always wanted, and it is what some of them will expect. Her opponents will draw the same conclusion. Labour has been quick to accuse Mrs May of talking nice talk about social mobility while economic muscle ensures yet again that the middle class will cream off the benefits at the expense of the disadvantaged.</p> <p>It is possible that Mrs May\u2019s plans will work out benignly. But the practical evidence is against her. Areas of England that are underperforming at secondary level are not going to find their provision improved by selection. On the contrary, selection will simply create <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/09/grammar-schools-education-selection-divisive-ineffective\" title=\"\">fresh divisions</a> which will almost inevitably reward the better-off and penalise the less prosperous. That was what was wrong with the old grammar-secondary modern divide. It is the all too predictable outcome of the new grammar-academy divide too. It is reckless stuff.</p> <p>Mrs May\u2019s gamble is political as well as educational. Her underlying wish to get away from the liberal consensus where it has failed, whether in social or economic policy, is understandable. But she is not doing this in ways that bring the public together in the way she says she wants. Voters and interest groups on the right will listen to Mrs May\u2019s speech and conclude that she is bringing back grammar schools to benefit middle-class Tory voters. Those on the left will conclude she is turning her back on working-class voters who have benefited from the comprehensive system and from recent reforms. Mrs May insists she is a different kind of Tory. Plenty of people on both sides of politics will think this shows she is nothing of the sort. If she wants to win this battle, she is going to move quickly. But the divisiveness of the issue may already be beyond her power to control.</p>",

He says: \u201cThere are multiple dimensions to developing the digital opportunities in Formula One. \u201cThere is the marketing potential in telling the Formula One story, and it\u2019s a great story with some of the most attractive stars in the world \u2013 great drivers, great teams, great brands, great technology.\u201d</p> <p>Americans know how to sell things.

Carey will not go along with Ecclestone\u2019s view of the young.

The director, who has become one of the UK\u2019s most unique talents with diverse and daring projects such as Down Terrace, Kill List, Sightseers and A Field in England hit something of a pothole at last year\u2019s festival with the divisive JG Ballard adaptation High-Rise. But even that was an admirable failure, full of style and ambition, albeit caught up in a swirling and pretentious mess. His latest, Free Fire, eschews the strangeness of his previous work and makes a bold bid for a wider audience. But while it\u2019s undoubtedly his most accessible film to date, he\u2019s lost something crucial along the way.</p> <p>The film takes place over just one night and in just one building; a warehouse in 70s Massachusetts. It\u2019s the location of an arms deal and brings together an unlikely group of players (a cast that includes Cillian Murphy, Brie Larson, longtime Wheatley collaborator Michael Smiley, Armie Hammer and Sharlto Copley) all with varying agendas. After a testy start, things go from bad to really bad in an instant and a bloody standoff ensues with shots firing, voices raising and people dying.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/video/2016/sep/09/free-fire-trailer-ben-wheatleys-shootout-starring-brie-larson-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/52ahh\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2704337\"            data-video-name=\"Free Fire trailer: Ben Wheatley's shootout starring Brie Larson \u2013\u00a0video\"            data-video-provider=\"guardian.co.uk\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-57d2d18de4b07ac3d446a925\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/09/09/160909FreeFire_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/09/09/160909FreeFire.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/09/09/160909FreeFire_WebM.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/video/2016/sep/09/free-fire-trailer-ben-wheatleys-shootout-starring-brie-larson-video\">Free Fire trailer: Ben Wheatley\u2019s shootout starring Brie Larson \u2013 video</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>From the start, it\u2019s clear what Free Fire wants to be seen as: a future cult classic, its poster adorning the walls of grubby student bedrooms and regular boisterous special screenings filled with obsessive fans shouting out iconic quotes while dressed in character. For a while, it almost works. Despite being shot in Brighton, the film feels authentically of its time and place, especially given that it\u2019s Wheatley\u2019s first \u201cAmerican\u201d film and some of the lines are admittedly memorable (\u201cVernon was misdiagnosed as a child genius and never got over it\u201d).</p> <p>But once shots are fired, the film descends into a repetitive orgy of bullets and bad jokes. The constant shooting is confusingly choreographed with frenetic camerawork annoying rather than impressing and the sheer noise of the film begins to have a repellent effect. The squabbling between the characters is clearly supposed to be snappy but there\u2019s a sharpness missing, with humour broad when it should be biting. The direction is also rather workmanlike, a shock given Wheatley\u2019s back catalogue, and there\u2019s an overriding sensation that this is his small sacrifice for the mainstream. One has to give him credit though for going down this route, rather than succumbing to the world of the franchise.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0a02400f0bfb078a5b416e68f0d98255970a9b43\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0a02400f0bfb078a5b416e68f0d98255970a9b43/0_43_1280_768/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Free-Fire (1)\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>The cast try their best, with Sam Riley\u2019s odious junkie a standout, but they\u2019re hampered with ciphers that lack the distinctive idiosyncrasies of Tarantino and even Ritchie characters (Sharlto Copley\u2019s one defining characteristic is that he\u2019s South African and has a funny accent). There\u2019s something lacking, a touch of the bizarre or the perverse, with just one particularly nasty death to serve as a reminder that you\u2019re watching a Ben Wheatley film.</p> <p>If Free Fire is Wheatley\u2019s bid for the multiplex, then he could have made a far worse attempt, but when compared with his previous work, it\u2019s disappointingly vanilla, failing to progress his considerable talents and reminding us all to begrudgingly respect the cult of Tarantino.</p>",
  "<p> The first shoes <a href=\"http://justin-tipping.squarespace.com/\">Justin Tipping</a> bought using his own money were white <a href=\"http://store.nike.com/us/en_us/pd/air-presto-ultra-flyknit-mens-shoe/pid-11055339/pgid-11044479\">Nike Air Prestos</a>.

All Tipping had to show afterward was a bruised face. </p> <p> \u201cThe next day while I was walking through school, every other guy, even if I didn\u2019t know him, took five seconds out of his day to walk up to me and say, \u2018Oh you got fucked up, man\u2019 and laugh at me,\u2019\u201d recalls Tipping, who makes his directing debut with Kicks, released on Friday. </p> <p> When Tipping arrived at graduate school at the <a href=\"http://www.afi.com/Conservatory/\">American Film Institute Conservatory</a>, he was \u201ctrying to find my story, my American movie. I knew I wanted to look at issues surrounding masculinity and violence so I thought back to my own experience.</p> <p> \u201cI thought back to getting stomped out and the aftermath and thought that moment was a good way in to explore why boys act the way they do, why there are these weird social hierarchies that exist and that have been there for generations,\u201d he says. </p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWV2hK4HVEk\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/wWV2hK4HVEk?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p> At AFI, he earned a Student Academy Award for the short film <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2073039/\">Nani</a>, which he co-wrote with <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm4454043/\">Joshua Beirne-Golden</a>; then they teamed up to write Kicks<em>,</em> a coming-of-age film that\u2019s much more than a boy-meets-shoe, boy-loses-shoe, boy-gets-shoe-back story. </p> <p> A compelling mixture of the gritty and surreal, Kicks<em> </em>tells the story of Brandon, an undersized Bay Area teen caught between the dreams of childhood and the harsh actuality of adolescence. The film opens with Brandon talking over a slow motion foot chase ... and a floating astronaut only Brandon sees. This symbol of Brandon\u2019s isolation and his desire for escape, is a recurring motif throughout the movie.</p> <p> When Brandon obtains the shoes he covets \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.flightclub.com/air-jordans/air-jordan-1\">Bred Ones</a> (Black and Red Jordan Ones, a renowned shoe among sneakerheads) \u2013 he\u2019s convinced his stature will grow. But like Tipping, he gets beaten up and robbed. (This being 2016, the aggressors also record the incident on their phones and post it online.) Humiliated and desperate to recover his shoes, Brandon and his two best friends undertake a classic hero\u2019s quest. Their journey reveals the consequences of macho posturing and ultimately forces them to confront their values and those of their community. </p> <p> It feel like a quintessential urban American tale but Tipping draws from a wider array of influences. Growing up in the Bay Area, he loved mainstream movies \u2013 Steven Spielberg, John Hughes and Star Wars<em tabindex=\"-1\"> </em>\u2013 while dreaming of becoming a rap star. (\u201cBig mistake,\u201d he acknowledges.) In college, Tipping spent a semester in Rome and became entranced by Italian cinema; returning to the University of California at Santa Barbara, he switched from economics to film and media studies and says that for Kicks<em tabindex=\"-1\"> </em>he drew upon his time in Rome as well as the French classic, <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/great-movie-the-bicycle-thief--bicycle-thieves-1949\">The Bicycle Thief</a>.</p> <p> Still, much of the movie is distinctly personal, such as the use of rap to bolster the narrative and, of course, the astronaut. \u201cIt took a lot to convince people,\u201d he says, because it would be expensive and time-consuming on an indie film. Tipping insisted it was essential to the film \u2013 \u201cI would rather have made a different movie until I was able to make this with the vision I wanted\u201d \u2013 and ultimately prevailed.</p> <p> Tipping also carefully tracked the script\u2019s violence. The shocking first fatality transpires before a gun can be fired. \u201cI did not want to Tarantino anything,\u201d Tipping says. \u201cThese are real issues kids are facing and if you glamorize it then it becomes disrespectful.\u201d The director wanted the audience to feel anxious even when no violence was occurring onscreen, to give a sense of the the toll taken by living in that environment. \u201cI lived in constant anxiety when I was young.\u201d</p> <p> Tipping also strove to make Flaco and Marlon, Brandon\u2019s murderous uncle, more than one-dimensional gangsters. \u201cIf I set them up as \u2018that thug\u2019 then they\u2019re easy to dismiss,\u201d Tipping says. Instead both are depicted as trying, in deeply flawed ways, to be responsible and loving family men. \u201cI think about the kids stomping me out and what happened to them that made them think it was OK to beat the crap out of anyone. It must have been more painful than anything I\u2019d been through.\u201d</p> <p>Despite this thoughtful approach, the movie is rated R because the teenage boys talk like, well, teenage boys. Tipping contrasts it with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/jul/26/jason-bourne-review-matt-damon-back-in-fun-but-forgettable-action-revamp\">Jason Bourne</a>, which \u201chas an execution-style scene every two minutes\u201d, but is rated PG-13, \u201cso they can show that in a high school but they can\u2019t show Kicks there.\u201d</p> <p> Casting was crucial, especially since Tipping used relatively inexperienced actors with little rehearsal time on a low budget. He saw an instant connection between 13-year-old Jahking Guillory (Brandon) and Christopher Meyer (Rico) and CJ Wallace (Albert), both 17. \u201cThere was this natural dynamic where they treated [Guillory] like a younger brother and you could see he\u2019d be bragadocious and wanted to be like them. It was raw and authentic.\u201d</p> <p> They gelled so well at the audition that Wallace, the son of the late rapper Biggie Smalls, took Meyer\u2019s phone number, knowing they\u2019d both get cast. \u201cWhat you see is on the screen \u2013 those guys really became my best friends,\u201d says Meyer.</p> <p> Authenticity came easy for Guillory. \u201cI was always the underdog, the smallest person in my neighborhood and with my long hair people teased me that I looked like a little girl,\u201d he says, although instead of using violence he\u2019d prove teasers wrong as a local football and track star in Long Beach, California. Unlike Brandon, Guillory says he wouldn\u2019t attack a bully to get his sneakers back. \u201cI\u2019d just tell the dude\u2019s mom,\u201d he laughs.</p> <p> Wallace, raised to be polite and well-behaved, reveled in the chance to indulge in Albert\u2019s \u201ctalk to any girl, say anything and believe everything. It was like a little escape for me to break all the rules\u201d.</p> <p> Tipping says the teenagers had a natural feel for what their characters would say. He allowed numerous takes, especially for Wallace. \u201cHe\u2019d have us laughing so hard I\u2019d say, \u2018let\u2019s do 10 more,\u2019\u201d Tipping says. However, some humour was cut \u201cotherwise the audience wouldn\u2019t pay attention to the next scene\u201d. Wallace cites a deleted car chase \u201cwhere I was going off like Chris Tucker\u201d that would have tilted the tone of the movie too much.</p> <p> The rookie director also knew how to draw emotions from his young cast. Before they started filming, Tipping asked Guillory to think about someone he\u2019d lost \u2013 \u201cmy great-grandma was my best friend\u201d \u2013 and then talked to him about it on set when Guillory needed to cry.</p> <p> Tipping had one final casting challenge: the shoes in question. \u201cI spent weeks changing my mind \u2013 from <a href=\"http://sneakernews.com/2016/01/20/first-look-at-the-air-jordan-11-space-jam/\">Space Jams </a>to red <a href=\"http://www.flightclub.com/air-jordan-4-retro-toro-bravo-fire-red-white-black-cmnt-grey-011779\">Toro Bravos,</a>\u201d he says, although they were always Air Jordans, the original status shoe. </p> <p> Needing a timeless style, he finally chose Bred Ones ... but then needed a new pair \u2013 two actually, in case the star got scuffed up. \u201cWe were so strapped for cash, having spent 80% of our wardrobe budget on the astronaut costume so I dug deep into my own pockets,\u201d he says. While it\u2019s \u201ca little embarrassing\u201d to admit, he\u2019s basically the same shoe size Guillory was at 13 so he kept both pairs for himself. \u201cScore for me,\u201d he says. \u201cI have not been jumped for them yet.\u201d</p>",

It is as if history will not bend to her will and she is struggling to cope with the battle.</p> <p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t at 100%,\u201d she said, \u201cbut I also think she played well. She deserved to win.\u201d</p> <p>It was not exactly a brass-band ringing endorsement. For Williams, Kerber and Pliskova are opponents to be respected but kept at a distance. No way, she said, would she talk about the rankings.</p> <p>Her close friend Wozniacki, who has been No1 but has never won a major, was less reluctant to discuss the situation. \u201cIt\u2019s not a lot of people who have been No1. It\u2019s a huge thing. [Kerber] definitely has a target on her back now. Everyone wants to beat the No1 player in the world.\u201d</p> <p>Few more so than the woman whose glorious reign has just been interrupted. For how long? It is hard to tell. Saturday\u2019s final might supply evidence, one way or another, if Kerber is good enough to stay ahead of the hunting pack.</p> <p>While reputation and achievement favour Kerber, the force is decidedly with Pliskova. Wozniacki said of her: \u201cShe\u2019s had a great year. She gets a lot of balls back. She also knows how to change the pace. She gets good angles.\u201d</p> <p>Kerber is the favourite, even though she mysteriously <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/13/monica-puig-puerto-rica-gold-medal-history-rio-2016-womens-singles-monique-kerber-tennis\" title=\"\">lost her way in her last big final, at the Rio Olympics against M\u00f3nica Puig</a>, and lost four matches in a row after beating Williams in Melbourne.</p> <p>It should be noted that Pliskova not only bullied the ailing Williams out of contention in straight sets, but she might also have Kerber\u2019s number. The new world No1 is among the 11 players who have lost to her on a run stretching back to the start of the Cincinnati Open. Pliskova bossed Kerber in that final and will draw on that for inspiration on Arthur Ashe Court.</p> <p>She hinted after this semi-final how she might play against one of the best grinders in the sport: \u201cI didn\u2019t want to get into long rallies with Serena.\u201d</p> <p>This could be a short, brutal match. If so, Pliskova will be the new champion.</p>",

  "<p>Three former senior directors at Tesco have been charged with fraud in relation to a \u00a3263m-plus accounting scandal at the supermarket chain.</p> <p>Carl Rogberg, the former finance director of Tesco UK, Christopher Bush, the former managing director of Tesco UK, and John Scouler, the former commercial director for food, have all been charged with one count of fraud by abuse of position and one count of false accounting.<br></p> <p>A statement from the Serious Fraud Office said the alleged activity occurred between February and September 2014.</p> <p>The three men have been summoned to appear at Westminster magistrates court on 22 September 2016 and could face up to 10 years in jail if found guilty of fraud by abuse and seven years for false accounting.</p> <p>The SFO said its investigation into Tesco remained ongoing and it is still possible that further individuals could face action. However, it is understood that former chief executive Philip Clarke, who was questioned under caution by the SFO, will not be charged.</p> <p>Tesco said in a statement that it continued to co-operate with the SFO\u2019s investigation: \u201cThe last two years have seen an extensive programme of change at Tesco, but given this is an ongoing legal matter, we are unable to provide any further comment at this time.\u201d</p> <p>The SFO launched a criminal investigation into accounting practices at Tesco in October 2014 after the company admitted it had overstated profits by \u00a3263m because it had incorrectly booked payments from suppliers, relating to issues such as marketing costs or reaching sales targets.<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c4893102161e0b06b107ae2d27ecddc75d8bae50\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c4893102161e0b06b107ae2d27ecddc75d8bae50/0_0_2560_1536/1000.jpg\" alt=\"From left: John Scouler, Carl Rogberg, and Christopher Bush\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">From left: John Scouler, Carl Rogberg, and Christopher Bush</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Linkedin/Facebook/Handout</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The scandal came to light after a whistleblower alerted the company\u2019s new chief executive, Dave Lewis, who took over in September 2014. A team of forensic accountants from Deloitte then established that Tesco had artificially inflated an estimate of first-half profits given to the City in August 2014. They also found similar practices had been in place in prior reporting periods. In April 2015, Tesco said it had found a further \u00a360m in mis-statements from previous years, mostly as a result of an audit of its Irish operations.</p> <p>Clarke, who left the company when Lewis arrived, was questioned by the SFO in relation to the scandal, which wiped millions of pounds off the supermarket\u2019s value. However, a source said he had been told he would not face charges.</p> <p>Rogberg and Scouler left Tesco in November 2014. The two men, and Bush, were all members of the so-called \u201cCheshunt Eight\u201d \u2013 named after the location of Tesco\u2019s Hertfordshire head office \u2013 who were suspended when the profits overstatement first came to light. </p> <p>Bush\u2019s legal representative issued a statement saying he was \u201cextremely disappointed\u201d by the SFO\u2019s decision to charge him. \u201cHe is not guilty and from the outset has fully co-operated with both Tesco and the SFO in their investigations. He will vigorously contest these allegations and is confident he will be cleared of any wrongdoing,\u201d said the representative in a statement.</p> <p>Neil O\u2019May, a partner at law firm Norton Rose Fulbright, said: \u201cOur client, Carl Rogberg, has always denied any wrongdoing. He will be vigorously contesting the charges to prove his innocence.\u201d</p> <p>Scouler joined internet provider TalkTalk as commercial director in February last year but is understood to be on sabbatical. The company said it was aware of the SFO\u2019s announcement but could not comment on \u201can ongoing investigation unrelated to TalkTalk\u201d.</p> <p>It emerged last week that the Financial Reporting Council, the accountancy watchdog, had dropped an investigation into Laurie McIlwee, the former Tesco chief financial officer. McIlwee has been interviewed by the SFO, but only as a witness, and it is understood he is not being considered for prosecution. The FRC continues to investigate Tesco\u2019s former auditor, PwC.</p> <p>A third investigation by the grocery market watchdog in January led to Tesco being ordered to make significant changes in the way it deals with suppliers, after finding that the supermarket, Britain\u2019s biggest, had deliberately delayed payments to maximise profits.</p> <p>The SFO has said it wants to wrap up the Tesco case by the end of this year \u2013 although it did originally expect to finalise the investigation in 2015. It was rumoured to be pushing for a new type of deal that would let Tesco avoid a criminal prosecution. A \u201cdeferred prosecution agreement\u201d (DPA), which requires high court approval, would involve fines and other undertakings, if the company co-operates.</p> <p>City analysts have warned that the scandal could cost Tesco a \u00a3500m fine. </p> <p>The charges against Tesco executives come after the SFO asked the government for an extra \u00a321m to help it keep pursuing complex cases, as it struggles with a string of investigations into high-profile cases and complex financial dealings including Libor and Euribor rigging. It is currently investigating allegations concerning Tata Steel, Airbus GlaxoSmithKline, Rolls-Royce and Barclays.</p> <p></p>",

As in the UK, the contracts were especially insidious in the fast-food, cinema, hotel and casino industries. They included big names such as McDonald\u2019s, Pizza Hut and the hamburger chain Wendy\u2019s.</p> <p>From 1 April it became illegal for any new workers employed to be offered zero-hours contracts and any current workers must be offered compliant employment terms by 1 April 2017.</p> <p>Unite members have since been run busy negotiating new employment contracts for their members \u2013 and travelling internationally to share their success story with other unions. </p> <p>The new legislation stipulates that workers must be offered a fixed, minimum number of hours each week, and will not be penalised for refusing any extra work they are offered at short notice. </p> <p>\u201cWe have been pretty in demand, everyone wants the nitty-gritty details of how we pulled it off,\u201d said Joe Carolan, a senior organiser for Unite.</p> <p>\u201cInternationally, activists think the speed of the victory was startling. But we\u2019ve been campaigning since 2005. We\u2019ve had long drawn-out scraps. Endless fights.\u201d </p> <p>This week the union has been celebrating the conclusion of a significant and lengthy negotiation with Restaurant Brands New Zealand (which includes the KFC, Starbucks and Pizza Hut franchises) agreeing to move its 4,000 zero-hours employees on to fixed-hour contracts. The company will now guarantee workers a minimum number of hours each week, and \u201creasonable compensation\u201d for any time they are expected to be available. </p> <p>Intense negotiations are also continuing with Burger King and Wendy\u2019s, said Carolan. But one fast-food chain is continuing to dig its heels in: \u201cMcDonald\u2019s are tough,\u201d said Carolan. </p> <p>Hehir said the zero-hours contracts demanding 24/7 availability from employees were evidence of poor management \u2013 and using modern technology most companies had been able to accurately pinpoint the busiest times, when extra workers may be needed, to a 10-hour window each week. </p> <p>The introduction of minimum fixed hours had also taken away any tools some managers use to discriminate against workers on a personal basis \u2013 and reward or punish them with more or less hours arbitrarily. </p> <p>\u201cIf you forget to smile at your boss on their birthday, that\u2019s no longer something they can punish you for by withholding shifts,\u201d said Hehir. \u201cWorkers have more stability, more confidence they will not be punished for personal slights \u2013 real or imagined.\u201d</p> <p>Shirley Wang, who is employed at Sky City Casino in Auckland on a fixed-hour contract and is an active Unite member, says the next hurdle is to move workers to banded employment contracts \u2013 in which the average hours they work are measured over a year, and the employee is then offered that many hours on a regular basis. Unite is also making moves towards unionising and defending migrant workers in New Zealand.</p> <p>\u201cThe legislation was a massive win,\u201d said Wang. \u201cBut that doesn\u2019t mean there aren\u2019t still huge challenges ahead of us. Before, no-one wanted to talk to us, we were dismissed. Now, businesses are finally realising that a lot of what we\u2019re saying is actually common sense. That a more insecure, higher turnover of staff was actually costing them money. A loyal workforce is something every employer should strive for, because in the end it is always good for business. And that is our strongest argument.\u201d</p> <p>Carolan says what pushed the New Zealand ban on zero-hours contracts over the line was the swift, bipartisan support that became united by a common outrage: that Kiwi workers could not be guaranteed earning a living.</p> <p>\u201cWhat really ignited the campaign was when it became single-issue, and when we called it \u2018zero hours\u2019. The terms before that \u2013 underemployed, flexible hours \u2013 nothing resonated, But zero hours hit home. It\u2019s not just about persuading and mobilising the workers \u2013 you\u2019ve got to get everyone to see common sense. When we did, we were unstoppable.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Bermondsey, Millwall\u2019s south London home patch for the past 106 years, has been called many things in its time. \u201cLondon\u2019s larder\u201d was one hopeful piece of rebranding, tribute to its many tinned food factories. \u201cBiscuit town\u201d came and went, legacy of the Peek Freans boom years, when the world\u2019s combined Garibaldi reserves were supplied by London\u2019s most unloved peninsula. Even snappier, although not often mentioned by local estate agents, was \u201cTarget Area G\u201d, the Luftwaffe\u2019s name for Bermondsey and surrounding areas during the nine-month firestorm of the blitz.</p> <p>Miraculously the Den escaped the bombings untouched right up until April 1943, when it was all but destroyed in a raid. Millwall\u2019s manager, Bill Voisey, sitting up late in his office, survived a direct hit, although his injuries meant he was succeeded by the legendarily debonair Jack Cock, England footballer, war hero, popular singer and star of the &#xa0;films <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0164233/\" title=\"\">The Winning Goal</a> and <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0020936/\" title=\"\">The Great Game</a>.</p> <p>It is a very Millwall, very south-Bermondsey-cum-New-Cross-wilderness kind of story; a place that seems to have spent most of the past 500 years since Henry VIII demolished on a whim its only monastery, being unwanted, unloved and generally shot to bits.</p> <p>These same qualities of resilience may be needed again after the decision this week by Lewisham\u2019s Labour council to approve plans for compulsory purchase of land around the Den as part of a mass \u201cregeneration\u201d project. Millwall currently rent the land under threat, the loss of which could threaten the club\u2019s basic operations. They offered to buy it at a higher price. Lewisham chose to go with the developer Renewal, which is ultimately controlled by offshore companies with mysterious owners and whose plan involves shoehorning in 2,400 homes, the huge majority for private sale, as part of Boris Johnson\u2019s ramped-up \u201cNew Bermondsey\u201d vision.</p> <p>The end result of which is more of the same old, same old. Target Area G is once more in the crosshairs. The Den is again under attack. As indeed, more broadly, is football itself, or at least its fogged and dwindling status as a force for community and collectivism, to be prized and valued beyond the annihilating simplicities of the market.</p> <p>This was probably always coming. From the outside, Bermondsey has always felt like an oddly abandoned place, hard to get to, hard to get out of, a hidden corner of outer-inner London jutting out into the southern bend of the Thames. Wealth and work have tended to dribble away, first the leather industry, then the food factories and finally the docks.</p> <p>Millwall have at least stuck around, a marmalade and jam works team from the Isle of Dogs shifted up river and settled on Cold Blow Lane. It has been a febrile existence, right from the first dockers\u2019 derby with West Ham, during which the East Ham Echo noted \u201call attempts at football were ignored\u201d, culminating in West Ham\u2019s Jarvis inflicting serious injury by smashing the head of Millwall\u2019s Deans against a metal advertising board.</p> <p>A period of success in the late 1960s was followed by the closure of the docks and an increased sense of inner-city alienation. The hand grenade chucked on to the pitch from the away end at Griffin Park may have been a harmless replica, but for two decades the Den attracted some genuinely frightening people. A huge amount of work has gone into tackling racism in the ground. But this was for many years a place where something curdled and scabbed did occasionally erupt into view. Football cannot solve these problems. It does at least try.</p> <p>This is all a part of the current story. New Bermondsey. We get the idea. Time to flush out and rebrand. Revenue streams must be wrung, the light let in. The developers\u2019 plan is, quite literally, to \u201cclad\u201d the Den, to make it look new from the outside, the architectural equivalent of slapping a new hat on grandma\u2019s head and wheeling her off into the corner because the posh in-laws are coming round.</p> <p>And yet, industry loyalties aside, there are some serious problems with what Lewisham and its developer are proposing to do. For a start, the plans to create a \u201cnew community\u201d overlook the fact Bermondsey already has a community, one that has been flourishing, quietly, with help from Millwall themselves.</p> <p>This is not simply a local leisure service provider. Football clubs do not relocate when times are thin (unless they are MK Dons). They stick it out and engage. London\u2019s hunger for space may have finally touched the Den. But the club believes it has the right not to be edged out, but to play a role in the regeneration of the area. Instead it finds itself ushered to one side by a local authority that has little historic interest in sport of any kind, whose boundaries end a tantalising 500 metres west, and whose inhabitants have often been supported by the club\u2019s own community initiatives.</p> <p>Three years ago Millwall sent their players out to join the (successful) campaign to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2013/jan/24/protest-plans-shut-lewisham-hospital\" title=\"\">save Lewisham hospital A&amp;E department</a>, a triumph that offered plenty of political capital to the same officials now selling their land from under their feet. The Millwall Community Trust has also been out there going above and beyond, offering education and opportunities, helping young offenders and kids with learning difficulties. By way of thanks the Trust will now be evicted when the compulsory purchase order goes through. Lewisham council has a motto: <em>Salus Populi Suprema Lex</em>, or \u201cThe welfare of the people is the highest law\u201d. Words, huh.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/aug/31/millwall-west-bromwich-albion-checkatrade-efl-trophy\">Millwall struggle to see the benefits of revamped Checkatrade Trophy | Nick Ames</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Millwall have offered to put forward their own regeneration scheme with the club at its heart. Instead Lewisham chose to partner with a developer whose ultimate parents are offshore companies owned by mysterious entities including a family trust. There is no evidence Renewal has ever carried out a major development project. It has no interests in the area.</p> <p>What the council\u2019s decision seems to say is that there are communities and then there are communities. A rising tide lifts all boats and Bermondsey is on the up. Just two miles from the Den they are still trying to sell the \u00a350m penthouses of the glass and steel sky city, floors 53-65 of the Shard. Canary Wharf is just over the river, clearing house for transient global billions. The Rotherhithe peninsula sits crunched between the two. Welcome, then, New Bermondsey, heir to Biscuit town, Target Area G, and plain old Bermondsey. Let them come.

But there is a downside... | Michelle Nijhuis</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cThis is clearly something in my small way done to honor our president,\u201d Platt, who recently discovered that he was also a distant relative of Obama, told the Associated Press.<br></p> <p>\u201cI have named a number of species after people I admire, from my father-in-law, my PhD adviser, and good friends who are academics and/or amateur naturalists,\u201d Platt said in a press release. \u201c<em tabindex=\"-1\">Baracktrema obamai</em> will endure as long as there are systematists studying these remarkable organisms.\u201d</p> <p>The findings about the parasites, which are found in black marsh turtles native to Malaysia, were presented and discussed in a new paper Platt co-authored in the Journal of Parasitology with Jackson Roberts, Dr Raphael Or\u00e9lis-Ribeiro, and Dr Ash Bullard, of Auburn University in Alabama.</p> <p>Discovering and naming the new parasite, one of the 30 that he has discovered over the course of his career, was one of Dr Platt\u2019s last acts before he retired this year from teaching at Saint Mary\u2019s College in Indiana.</p> <p>\u201cThe new species is so unusual and distinctive that the research team has named a new genus to include the new species,\u201d said Michael Sukhedo, the editor of the Journal of Parasitology. \u201cThis is the first time such an action has been taken for this group of turtle parasites in 21 years.\u201d</p> <p>Despite their bad reputations, Sukhedo said that many people who study parasites \u201csee them as beautiful and resilient\u201d, a crucial understanding to the life in our planet. According to Sukhedo, some 70% of all animals on Earth are parasites.</p> <p>Parasites \u201cface incredible obstacles to complete their journey (life cycle) and must contend with the immune system of the host in order to mature and reproduce\u201d, Platt said.</p> <p>Understanding their evolutionary background and discovering such new parasites can also be essential in better understanding dangerous ailments.</p> <p>The <em>Baracktrema obamai</em> are a distant relative of the parasitic flatworm which causes schistosomiasis, a destructive human ailment which affects millions of people, particularly in the developing world.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the <em>Baracktrema obamai</em> should be welcomed like a steadily growing list of friends. Including more than a dozen schools who have taken his moniker, Obama has also named after him an Antiguan mountain, a species of lichen, a spider, an Amazonian puffbird and an extinct group of polyglyphanodontian lizard from the late Cretaceous epoch dubbed the Obamadon.</p>",
  "<p><br>Donald Trump knows a thing or two about buying politicians. By his own admission, that was his own relationship with the elected official he now calls Crooked Hillary.</p> <p>\u201cAs a businessman and a very substantial donor to very important people, when you give, they do whatever the hell you want them to do,\u201d Trump <a href=\"http://www.wsj.com/articles/donald-trump-says-his-past-politics-were-transactional-1438213199\">told the Wall Street Journal</a> last year. \u201cAs a businessman, I need that.\u201d</p> <p>A few days later, on stage at the first debate of the primaries, Trump defended the practice.</p> <p>There was no promise to reform the system; merely a statement of his transactions. That was simply his answer to the difficult question of why this Republican candidate had donated so much money to so many Democrats.</p> <p>\u201cI will tell you that our system is broken,\u201d he <a href=\"http://time.com/3988276/republican-debate-primetime-transcript-full-text/\">explained</a>. \u201cI gave to many people, before this, before two months ago, I was a businessman. I give to everybody. When they call, I give. And do you know what? When I need something from them two years later, three years later, I call them, they are there for me.\u201d</p> <p>The political world according to Trump is much like hiring a lawyer or accountant. He pays up; they follow his orders. The art of this deal is straightforward: the buyer enjoys considerable leverage over the seller.</p> <p>Trump\u2019s explanations of his donations are helpful context for understanding at least two curious payments to state attorneys-general.</p> <p>Both Pam Bondi of Florida and Greg Abbott of Texas (now the Texas governor) were the lucky recipients of Trump donations. Bondi received a $25,000 contribution from Trump a few days after her office <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2016/06/10/politics/pam-bondi-donald-trump-donation/\">declared</a> it was \u201creviewing the allegations\u201d in a lawsuit filed in New York against Trump University in 2013. Both Abbott and Bondi deny any impropriety.</p> <p>Bondi\u2019s office ended the review without taking any action against the so-called university, that reports suggest was little more than a high-pressure sales opportunity for a worthless investment seminar.</p> <p>Trump also handed over cash <a href=\"http://www.twcnews.com/tx/austin/politics/2016/06/2/ap--greg-abbott-given--35k-gubernatorial-campaign-donation-after-trump-university-probe-in-texas-dropped.html\">to Abbott</a> to support his gubernatorial campaign in Texas. That was three years after Abbott dropped its investigation into the business that the New York attorney general has called \u201cstraight-up fraud\u201d.</p> <p>Proving corruption is notoriously difficult in a court of law, and campaign finance laws are just as notoriously difficult to enforce. So for now, we must be thankful to the Internal Revenue Service \u2013 and the reporting of the Washington Post \u2013 for uncovering the mysterious circumstances of the Bondi payment.</p> <p>Trump paid Bondi\u2019s campaign through his tax-exempt family foundation, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2016/09/01/trump-pays-irs-a-penalty-for-his-foundation-violating-rules-with-gift-to-florida-attorney-general/\">in violation of tax laws</a>. Strangely, the donation was initially listed as going to a Kansas charity with a similar name to Bondi\u2019s political group. \u201cAn honest mistake,\u201d said the Trump Organization.</p> <p>That honest mistake cost Trump a $2,500 penalty to the IRS. It might also cost him his self-proclaimed position as an outsider who can upend the political system; and as a relentless critic of the Clinton Foundation\u2019s approach to donations.</p> <p>Instead, Trump looks more and more like the political insider he professes to disdain.</p> <p>Of course, he doesn\u2019t call Pam Bondi of Florida \u201cCrooked Pam\u201d. That would be a little ungenerous since she spoke so eloquently on his behalf at the Republican convention in Cleveland.</p> <p>\u201cWinning this election means reclaiming something to which I\u2019ve dedicated my entire career: the rule of law. Laws that make our neighborhoods safe. Laws that make our economy strong. Laws that apply equally to everyone,\u201d Bondi explained to the delegates in the hall.</p> <p>Bondi <a href=\"http://www.tampabay.com/news/politics/stateroundup/transcript-of-attorney-general-pam-bondis-speech-to-the-republican/2286207\">accused</a> Clinton of being \u201ca former secretary of state who believes the laws don\u2019t apply to her \u2026 This lawlessness must stop. Right here. Right now. Donald Trump will stop it.\u201d</p> <p>After one passing reference to Clinton\u2019s private email server, the crowd began chanting, and Bondi happily responded in kind.</p> <p>\u201cLock her up,\u201d said the attorney general. \u201cI love that.\u201d</p> <p>This is the rule of law seen through Alice\u2019s looking glass. A wonderland where a state\u2019s chief law enforcement officer loves the notion of locking up an elected official without charge or trial.</p> <p>A topsy-turvy state of affairs where lawlessness will be stopped by a man who is being sued for fraud.</p> <p>It would be too much to say that Trump is a hypocrite. You see, he hasn\u2019t promised to fix the broken system. He only pointed out that he bought other politicians. He only hinted that he has so much money that he can\u2019t be bought by other donors. Reform was never his rallying cry.</p> <p>A real reform candidate could have worked wonders in this presidential cycle. An outsider with unimpeachable credentials and a decent claim to credibility might have ripped through both the primaries and the general election. That was, in part, the appeal of Bernie Sanders.</p> <p>Instead, the Republican party nominated someone who openly admits to buying politicians, and whose relationship with the truth looks like a comb-over.</p> <p>Trump\u2019s pitch to voters isn\u2019t that he\u2019s cleaner than his supposedly crooked opponent. It\u2019s that he\u2019s paid so much for the broken system that he doesn\u2019t need to sell himself.</p> <p>This isn\u2019t your typical pay-to-play scheme. Trump has paid the politicians for years, and now he\u2019s trying to play the voters.</p>",
  "<p>Sir Philip Green has suffered a further blow to his reputation after the BHS scandal crossed the Atlantic thanks to Vanity Fair.<br></p> <p>The renowned US magazine has included a lengthy feature about the billionaire tycoon in its latest issue, describing him as \u201cBritain\u2019s Donald Trump\u201d on its cover.</p> <p>The article is headlined <a href=\"http://www.vanityfair.com/news/2016/09/how-sir-philip-green-outraged-an-entire-nation\">\u201cHow Sir Philip Green made an outrageous fortune and outraged an entire nation\u201d</a>. It describes the furore the collapse of BHS has caused in the UK and examines Green\u2019s background, quoting supporters of the tycoon in the US but also critics such as Labour MP Frank Field.</p> <p>The coverage of the scandal in the US is significant because Green has expanded Topshop into large American cities and the US private equity firm Leonard Green owns 25% of the chain.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/30/boredom-scavenging-stifling-heat-final-days-of-bhs-philip-green\">BHS collapsed into administration in April, with the last of its 164 shops closing last month.</a> The demise of the retailer led to 11,000 job losses and left a \u00a3571m pension deficit.</p> <p>Green sold the department store chain for \u00a31 to serial bankrupt Dominic Chappell 13 months before it collapsed. The tycoon, his family, and other BHS investors collected more than \u00a3580m from the company during the 15 years he ran it.</p> <p>The Vanity Fair article likens Green to Trump because of his \u201cflowing white curly locks, perma-tan, and unshakeable brashness\u201d. William D Cohan, the award-winning journalist who wrote the article, claims that Green called him while he was writing it to say: \u201cYou\u2019re on trial. Let\u2019s see how well behaved you are.\u201d</p> <p>The feature finishes with another quote from Green. The tycoon is quoted as telling Cohan: \u201cYou\u2019re going to find England, unfortunately, is a place where you get a lot of jealous, envious, you know, negative people. That\u2019s how it is.\u201d</p> <p>Green has denied putting pressure on the Pensions Regulator and dragging his feet over reaching a settlement concerning the pensions of 20,000 former BHS workers. He said on Friday he was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/sep/09/sir-philip-green-i-am-working-every-day-on-the-bhs-pension-crisis\">working to resolve the problem every day</a> and that the process took time because it was highly complex.</p> <p>Green said he felt compelled to deny allegations about his conduct during negotiations over a deal. He said Field, chairman of the parliamentary committee that investigated the demise of BHS, was wrong to accuse him of obstructing a settlement.</p> <p>\u201cMr Field suggested in the House of Commons on Wednesday there was a lack of willingness on my part to reach a settlement with regard to the pension fund. This is untrue, totally inaccurate and unhelpful in solving this issue,\u201d Green said.</p> <p>He also denied reports he was <a href=\"http://news.sky.com/story/sir-philip-green-makes-conditional-offer-to-plug-bhs-pension-hole-10554303\">trying to extract concessions from the Pensions Regulator in return for injecting money into the BHS pension scheme</a>. \u201cThere have also been suggestions in the press that I have tried to pressurise the regulator, or, as was stated on the front page of one newspaper, \u2018blackmail\u2019 it. This is wholly untrue. I am not in control of the process. I am following the process which has been set down by the regulator,\u201d he said.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jun/15/mps-sir-philip-greens-reputation-and-knighthood-depend-on-pension-offer\">Green told MPs in June he would \u201csort\u201d the pension deficit</a>, which threatens to severely reduce the pensions of the chain\u2019s former employees. He and his family took more than \u00a3400m out of BHS during 15 years of ownership.</p> <p>The businessman said he and his team had been cooperating with the Pensions Regulator for 17-18 months. He said he had always intended to secure a better outcome for pensioners than the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/apr/25/pension-protection-fund-bhs-retirement-ppf\">Pension Protection Fund</a> could achieve.</p> <p>He said: \u201cI would like to apologise sincerely to all the BHS people involved in this sorry affair. Contrary to all the coverage I have been working on this issue on a daily basis, and will continue to do so with my best efforts to achieve a satisfactory outcome for all involved as soon as possible.\u201d</p> <p>Green and Field have been at war over BHS for months <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jul/30/philip-green-blasts-frank-field-for-turning-inquiry-into-kangaroo-court\">after Field criticised Green before he attended a parliamentary inquiry into the chain\u2019s collapse</a>. Green is battling to hold on to his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jul/22/sir-philip-green-knighthood-under-review-bhs\">knighthood, which is under review after complaints about his ownership of BHS</a>.</p>",

Labour's dead. And it wont take a long time before the tories realise that the same thing is going to happen to them. The party's been captured by the hard right-wing and, at some point, the centrists will become a complete irrelevance.</p> <p>What we may see is a fragmentation, even atomisation, of mainstream political parties. In both the case of Labour and the Tories, the parties are increasingly becoming representative of narrow interest of core members. Tory members have always been very euro-sceptic and held a strong anti-immigration line. The brexit vote has legitimised those views and those euro-sceptic MPs who were once on the fringes and largely dismissed by their peers are now the ones calling the shots. The narrow victory by the Leave campaign has given them the confidence to push forward policies and ideas that are hugely divisive in the mistaken belief that these policies are supporters by a broad church. The way in which the Tory party has framed the Brexit vote as an almost exclusively anti-immigration vote and have pushed for grammar schools (despite the fact it was not in their manifesto) are good examples of this phenomenon. With Labour, you have a so-called social movement which <i>demands</i> that <i>all</i> MPS reflect the views of the majority of the membership, instead of looking to reflect the wide spectrum of interest and views of Labour voters. Just like the Tories they believe that this narrow movement holds great support across the UK. If only the media would give them a fair shot. If only the MPs would support the leader. If, if ...</p> <p>There is of course no need to have parties that act as broad and inclusive churches. There's nothing wrong with having parties that represent very specific and narrow interest. But if the political system is dominated by such parties then you need a system of proportional representation. And we wont get that until the Tories realise its in their interests to have one.</p></div> </div> </div>  </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-comment\" data-canonical-url=\"https://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/82904934\">  <div class=\"d2-comment-embedded\" itemscope itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Comment\"> <div class=\"d2-left-col\"> <a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/1864914\" title=\"View JHarris\u2019s profile\"> <img class=\"d2-avatar\" src=\"https://avatar.guim.co.uk/user/1864914\" height=\"40\" width=\"40\" alt=\"User avatar for JHarris\"> </a>  <span class=\"d2-badge d2-badge-staff d2-hidetext\" title=\"Guardian staff\" itemprop=\"jobTitle\">Guardian staff</span> </div> <div class=\"d2-right-col\"> <div itemscope itemprop=\"author\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\"> <a class=\"d2-username\" href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/1864914\" title=\"View JHarris\u2019s profile\" itemprop=\"url\"> <span itemprop=\"givenName\">JHarris</span> </a> </div> <div class=\"d2-permalink\"> <a class=\"d2-datetime\" href=\"https://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/82904934\" title=\"Link to this comment\" itemprop=\"datePublished\">09 September 2016 1:17pm</a> </div> <div class=\"d2-body\" itemprop=\"text\"><p>It's not quite that Labour's dead, which is why I talk about the end of the Labour Party <b>as we know it</b>.

The Paralympics does to much to educate society about disability and imparts a really positive message, but it also leads people to be more dismissive of real physical and mental conditions that are real and do need to be taken into account. The DLA or PIP is essential for some disabled people who need extra help. Disability already saps one's confidence because you effectively cannot trust your body, or indeed other's reactions. I have been made fun of for having no hair- having no eyelashes and eyebrows makes one look strange but also abused simply for having to stop walking suddenly because I felt my legs give way and someone pushed me aside. The Job Centres need to stop bullying disabled people into work they simply cannot do or can only do on a good day, by alluding to the Olympics and &quot;can do&quot; attitude.</p></div> </div> </div>  </figure>  <p>What do you think? <br></p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-09-09T12:30:58.586Z\">at 1.30pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57d2a7c6e4b013613fffb9a0\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-09T12:19:16.249Z\">1.19pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>More thoughts on the left from below the line:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-comment\" data-canonical-url=\"https://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/82904377\">  <div class=\"d2-comment-embedded\" itemscope itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Comment\"> <div class=\"d2-left-col\"> <a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/4019864\" title=\"View PSmd\u2019s profile\"> <img class=\"d2-avatar\" src=\"https://avatar.guim.co.uk/user/4019864\" height=\"40\" width=\"40\" alt=\"User avatar for PSmd\"> </a> </div> <div class=\"d2-right-col\"> <div itemscope itemprop=\"author\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\"> <a class=\"d2-username\" href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/4019864\" title=\"View PSmd\u2019s profile\" itemprop=\"url\"> <span itemprop=\"givenName\">PSmd</span> </a> </div> <div class=\"d2-permalink\"> <a class=\"d2-datetime\" href=\"https://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/82904377\" title=\"Link to this comment\" itemprop=\"datePublished\">09 September 2016 1:10pm</a> </div> <div class=\"d2-body\" itemprop=\"text\"><p>The left will always have a future. Especially in a country where inequality is becoming less popular.</p> <p>However, what does this mean for Labour party? The Labour party was the party of progress of the 20th century. Great party. But ultimately, undone by the breakdown in 1970's. Wilson's voters. don;t forget, remembered the depression and world war 2. Today's baby boomers have no memory of those things, just the 1970's and 1980's. Left boomers remember 1980's as unemployment, pit closures, factory closures. The right boomers remember the property ownership, share ownership, white collar jobs. And they were in the majority. Neoliberalism, polarised, because it widened wealth gaps, and as a result, many areas became more left wing (merseyside, glasgow etc). But they were minority by geography. Most Brits liked neoliberalism and did well out of it.</p> <p>Right wing baby boomers have such bad memories of the 1970's, that they'll insist on the economics that took us to the 1930's.<br />Where does this leave the labour party? Divided by geography. The party became a monopolist on left politics, and like monopolistic corporations who become bad for capitalism, the Labour party at it's electoral height, 1997-2010 became bad for socialism. The future may lie with Greens, or it may lie with various community action groups. The electoral and economic geography of this country is too difficult to consolidate for labour. In effect, they have pander to and to win the votes of, people who don't give two shits about low wage workers and renters, while holding onto the votes of people who do. Can;t be done anymore, I'm afraid.</p></div> </div> </div>  </figure>  <p>And a response ... <br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-comment\" data-canonical-url=\"https://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/82904646\">  <div class=\"d2-comment-embedded\" itemscope itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Comment\"> <div class=\"d2-left-col\"> <a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/1864914\" title=\"View JHarris\u2019s profile\"> <img class=\"d2-avatar\" src=\"https://avatar.guim.co.uk/user/1864914\" height=\"40\" width=\"40\" alt=\"User avatar for JHarris\"> </a>  <span class=\"d2-badge d2-badge-staff d2-hidetext\" title=\"Guardian staff\" itemprop=\"jobTitle\">Guardian staff</span> </div> <div class=\"d2-right-col\"> <div itemscope itemprop=\"author\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\"> <a class=\"d2-username\" href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/1864914\" title=\"View JHarris\u2019s profile\" itemprop=\"url\"> <span itemprop=\"givenName\">JHarris</span> </a> </div> <div class=\"d2-permalink\"> <a class=\"d2-datetime\" href=\"https://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/82904646\" title=\"Link to this comment\" itemprop=\"datePublished\">09 September 2016 1:14pm</a> </div> <div class=\"d2-body\" itemprop=\"text\"><p>Pretty good, that.</p></div> </div> </div>  </figure>  <p>Some of you have been talking about <a href=\"http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/labour-crushed-sheffield-election-just-8796901\">a council by-election in Sheffield yesterday</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-comment\" data-canonical-url=\"https://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/82903636\">  <div class=\"d2-comment-embedded\" itemscope itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Comment\"> <div class=\"d2-left-col\"> <a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/16499314\" title=\"View Roel1963\u2019s profile\"> <img class=\"d2-avatar\" src=\"https://avatar.guim.co.uk/user/16499314\" height=\"40\" width=\"40\" alt=\"User avatar for Roel1963\"> </a> </div> <div class=\"d2-right-col\"> <div itemscope itemprop=\"author\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\"> <a class=\"d2-username\" href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/16499314\" title=\"View Roel1963\u2019s profile\" itemprop=\"url\"> <span itemprop=\"givenName\">Roel1963</span> </a> </div> <div class=\"d2-permalink\"> <a class=\"d2-datetime\" href=\"https://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/82903636\" title=\"Link to this comment\" itemprop=\"datePublished\">09 September 2016 1:01pm</a> </div> <div class=\"d2-body\" itemprop=\"text\"><p>The Mosborough (Sheffield) Byelection result, where a Labour safe seat was lost, must come as a wake-up call for all who wish Labour to thrive.</p> <p>Losing Labour candidate was Julie Grocutt from Stocksbridge, an anti-Corbyn, pro-Smith groopie, who previously also put her 2 cents in regarding the Brick-through-&quot;Eagle's&quot;-window incident.</p> <p>Clearly, reality has just gobsmacked the claim by the rebel PLP and their right-wing handlers, that they and only they are &quot;electable&quot;, whilst Corbyn is not.<br />Put simply: in the UK there's two simultaneous political bottom-up revolutions going on.

Is Labour dead? What would a new party look like? Here is his response.</em><br></p> <p>The most basic point that arises from what my piece says is that the revival of the political left, here and across the world, is probably going to be a long haul. The break-up between social democracy and the new radical left (e.g Podemos in Spain, elements of Syriza in Greece, many of the forces behind the Bernie Sanders campaign) has only just happened. Debate and thought about how much economies have changed and what the left should do about it is still in the foothills. <br></p> <p>If you want a sense of what a long political haul looks like, start with the historian <a href=\"https://www.penguin.co.uk/books/1045411/the-road-to-1945/\">Paul Addison\u2019s book</a> The Road To 1945. My stock example of what it deals with is that campaigning for universal Child Benefit began in 1917, and it arrived nearly 30 years later. The same will apply to a Universal Basic Income (or UBI), which I think has to be the core of any new left politics \u2013 given that it addresses insecurity rooted in technology, and holds out the prospect of automation being a liberating rather than a destructive force. Ditto the fight for Proportional Representation. This isn\u2019t to say that elections in the meantime aren\u2019t worth fighting, but that the left should be thinking strategically, and understanding what an onerous task it faces.</p> <p>As to which political forces will be involved as this goes on \u2013 who knows? Personally, I have a sense that the Labour party as we know it is probably finished. The current battle over its control will be one chapter in a series of ruptures: over time, you\u2019ll probably see elements now seen to be hostile to each other coming together, and others falling away (for flavour of this, look at some former New Labour insiders and supporters who support UBI and PR, or the people working creditably hard for Jeremy Corbyn whose politics are a bit more forward-looking and radical than his). There will also be lots of people involved from beyond Labour, which is why I think one of the most interesting initiatives right now is the <a href=\"https://www.compassonline.org.uk/the-urgent-need-for-a-progressive-alliance/\">Progressive Alliance idea</a> being pursued by Compass, which involves Labour people, Greens, Lib Dems, people from the SNP etc etc.</p> <p>This is a time when politics is changing in front of our eyes, and uncertainty rules. My own belief is that the values of equality, solidarity and a world beyond the market will endure. But what form they will take is still to become clear.<br></p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-09-09T11:27:57.020Z\">at 12.27pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57d243ebe4b07ac3d446a696\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/johnharris\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-09T11:23:25.718Z\">12.23pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Does the left have a future?</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><em>Below John Harris comments on the biggest questions that came to mind when <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/06/does-the-left-have-a-future\">writing his long-read on whether the left has a future</a>.</em></p> <p>One of the biggest themes in the piece was about the changing nature of work, the roots of that change in technology, and the idea that in a world of temporary employment and the gig economy, work can\u2019t be the main way we give people security and stability.

  "<p>David de Gea is 6ft 4in but even he looks up to Zlatan Ibrahimovic \u2013 quite literally. There is an expression on the Manchester United goalkeeper\u2019s face that says as much as he does. It is one that Jos\u00e9 Mourinho hopes will find its echo in opponents when they line up alongside his side in the tunnel.

That physical presence, allied to what De Gea describes as a \u201cleap in quality\u201d, is one of the reasons why United are optimistic that they can do so.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/sep/09/jose-mourinho-pep-guardiola-rivalry-manchester-united-manchester-city-derby\">Mourinho v Guardiola: their poisonous rivalry finally hits the Premier League | Barney Ronay</a> </p> </aside>  <p>When Manchester City line up in the Old Trafford tunnel on Saturday, they will look across at De Gea, Eric Bailly, Marouane Fellaini, all big, powerful men.

  "<p>At first glance it looks like any normal fixture. London Irish v Richmond in the Greene King Championship, kick-off 3pm. Tickets still very much available if you are free on Saturday afternoon. Beneath the low-key facade, however, lies an occasion awash with irony. For anyone with a passing interest in the strange economics and murky past politics of English club rugby this is not any old game.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2016/may/17/championship-wild-west-professional-rugby-union-dangers\">\u2018The RFU Championship has become the wild west of professional rugby\u2019 | Robert Kitson</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It must be significant because Nigel Melville, the Rugby Football Union\u2019s director of professional rugby, will be among those present. On one level there is the whole acrimonious story of Richmond\u2019s ejection from the leagues in 1999 when they were subsumed, against their wishes, into a holding company bearing Irish\u2019s name. The grand old club have spent 16 years trying to recapture their lost status; small wonder their chairman, Peter Moore, frequently uses the word \u201cresurrection\u201d.</p> <p>Yet beneath Richmond\u2019s understandable pride \u2013 as well as the still-simmering resentment at their abandonment by some supposed Premiership friends \u2013 there is another layer of intrigue. Richmond may be back but not as a professional outfit. Having won promotion they have opted to stay a strictly part-time squad, combining their rugby with jobs in the City and elsewhere and training together for only a handful of hours each week. For better or for worse, it feels like the 1980s reincarnated.</p> <p>That would be fine \u2013 and prudent given Richmond attract 2,500 paying souls for their most attractive matches \u2013 if they were playing against clubs doing the same thing. But London Irish, relegated from the Premiership last season, are a fully professional operation with an All Black, Ben Franks, in their starting front row. Richmond have an old Etonian prop named Timmy Walford. Even setting aside the potential safety concerns, it raises an urgent question: what exactly is the Championship\u2019s raison d\u2019etre?</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2016/may/17/championship-wild-west-professional-rugby-union-dangers\" title=\"\">As highlighted last season in the Guardian</a> there are all sorts of issues for players operating beneath the Premiership: poor salaries, insufficient medical insurance, no union assistance in negotiating fairer contracts.

To have 24 professional clubs in England, to my mind, is not a financially viable option.\u201d</p> <p>Something has to give. While the Premiership salary cap has risen \u2013 the base level is \u00a36.5m per club with an allowance for two extra \u201cmarquee\u201d players on top \u2013 Championship clubs receive \u00a3530,000 in central funding per annum. A fully-professional squad of 35 pro players at a basic \u00a330,000 apiece \u2013 not enough to buy an open-air potting shed in Richmond \u2013 costs double that. \u201cIt was quite clear to me when I researched the other clubs that the Championship is not a business opportunity,\u201d Moore says, dryly. \u201cI think the RFU has got to redefine what the purpose of the league is.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"23bf5608a74e705bfc1477a6ad6b46d4f65ec661\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/23bf5608a74e705bfc1477a6ad6b46d4f65ec661/0_138_4250_2551/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ben Franks\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">London Irish\u2019s Ben Franks featured for the All Blacks in last year\u2019s World Cup final but is set to face Richmond\u2019s team of amateurs on Saturday.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andrew Matthews/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The good news is Melville is grasping that nettle.

Happily, the former England scrum-half and captain, who cut his own teeth in Otley, is alive to the ridiculous fact more Premiership academy players are dual-registered further down the pyramid than with second-tier clubs.</p> <p>\u201cThe Championship is critical to us for the development of young players,\u201d he said this week. \u201cWe need to get these kids into these games and I think we can create a really attractive product.\u201d</p> <p>To that end, Melville has been touring the country discussing options with clubs and sponsors. He accepts \u201csomething\u2019s broken and we have to fix it\u201d and met Sir Ian McGeechan, among others, in Nottingham on Thursday for further talks. Simply throwing money at the problem, he says, is not the answer. \u201cLet\u2019s not fool ourselves that by pumping a ton of money into a level-five club that it\u2019s somehow good for the game. It\u2019s probably not. We have to determine levels of professional rugby and make sure we police those to help people create sustainable rugby. It can\u2019t just be money going out of the game to a washed-up pro from the Premiership.\u201d</p> <p>The Richmond way is one possible avenue but is still problematic. What about clubs outside London where there are fewer well-paid banking jobs? If the whole league goes semi-pro will the gap with the Premiership become too cavernous? Might it lead to a closed shop with no promotion or relegation? What about the head-spinning logistics? Richmond\u2019s Canada international lock Tyler Hotson arrives at his desk at Goldman Sachs at 6.45am. Try doing that on a Monday morning in December having played away in Penzance the previous day. \u201cI\u2019m a lot busier than I used to be,\u201d says Hotson, who has had stints at Doncaster, Plymouth Albion and London Scottish. \u201cWe try to train in a short and sharp way simply because we have to.\u201d</p> <p>Hopefully there will be a happier ending than last time, when the club\u2019s backer Ashley Levett abruptly pulled the plug and Richmond, who finished fifth in their first Premiership season, were treated badly after going into administration. The board of English First Division Rugby had spotted a convenient opportunity to reduce the Premiership from 14 clubs to 12, prompting Richmond\u2019s then-coach John Kingston to accuse those in charge of \u201ccannibalism\u201d.</p> <p>Moore concedes the episode \u201cdoes still rankle\u201d but also has clear memories of the Levett era when Richmond briefly masqueraded as the world\u2019s most ambitious club. \u201cThere was no normality. We went from one employee to about 70 in three months. There was no business plan, there wasn\u2019t time. My background was financial and when I came in I said: \u2018I don\u2019t understand how this can possibly work.\u2019 It still doesn\u2019t work 20 years later.\u201d</p> <p>Good luck, regardless, to the gallant optimists of Richmond as they seek to improve on their opening 16-41 defeat to Jersey and remain a thriving local club for all. \u201cThe most important thing for us is to come out of this season solvent,\u201d Moore says. Even if there is the occasional mismatch, he promises the team will relish the opportunity and raise a communal glass in the bar afterwards. \u201cRugby is to be enjoyed, not endured. Once the players do their warm-downs and get past 7pm we\u2019re back to normal traditional rugby. Otherwise there\u2019s no point in playing.\u201d</p>",
  "<h2>NEARLY THERE</h2> <p>Manchester United first played Manchester City in 1881, and in the intervening 135 years they have battled for promotion, relegation, league titles and mid-table obscurity, sharing thrillers, snoozers, robberies and thrashings.

People have been mildly interested in their progress so far; they have occasionally sacrificed minutes of their time, before regaining their obliviousness and proceeding exactly as before. Accordingly, it makes perfect sense for the first of this season\u2019s super-duper, title-deciding Manchester derbies to be dominated by managers who shared some tediously tame mutual antipathy, several years ago and in another country. Perhaps \u201cPep\u201d will prod \u201cJos\u00e9\u201d on a pressure-point; maybe \u201cJos\u00e9\u201d will pinch \u201cPep\u201d on his inside thigh; oh, the pleasure, the privilege is ours, just as it will be to deconstruct their every movement and moment, each reflex and reflux.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Jos\u00e9 pouted petulantly, so Pep philosophically fondled what I suppose we must call his beard.

  "<h2>Will there be a grammar school in every town in England?</h2> <p>Potentially, yes. Theresa May has announced a \u00a350m fund to allow existing grammar schools to expand. That will encourage places that have been lobbying to follow the example of Sevenoaks, in Kent, where a new grammar school annexe was approved this year. May also suggested new selective schools could be opened, and that existing schools could revise their admissions policies to allow selection. If the government gets legislation in place later this year, the first new selective schools could be admitting pupils as early as autumn 2018.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/sep/09/mays-grammar-school-plans-put-six-years-of-educational-progress-at-risk\">May's grammar school plans 'put six years of educational progress at risk'</a> </p> </aside>  <h2>May said the new breed of grammars would help increase social mobility. The Ofsted head Sir Michael Wilshaw calls that \u201ctosh and nonsense\u201d. Who\u2019s right?</h2> <p>The evidence is with Wilshaw. Grammar schools now and in the past have admitted very few secondary pupils from disadvantaged backgrounds. Moreover, those who fail to get into grammars do worse than in non-selective areas. May claims that \u201cthe new grammars of the future\u201d will avoid these problems.</p> <h2>How does the expansion of religious schools fit in?</h2> <p>May also announced that new faith schools would be able to select their entire intake on the basis of religion, abolishing the current 50% cap on the use of religious tests in admissions. This will be warmly welcomed by Catholic educationalists and Orthodox Jewish groups, who opposed free schools because of the cap. Because Catholic schools have a good academic track record, May must hope more of them will be opened. But new grammar schools are likely to attract the brightest pupils from Catholic families as well.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/sep/08/can-grammar-schools-ever-be-inclusive\">Can grammar schools ever be 'inclusive'?</a> </p> </aside>  <h2>Will English universities be forced to sponsor schools?</h2> <p>Possibly. A surprising element of May\u2019s speech was a new demand that universities open or sponsor schools as part of their efforts to widen participation and justify future tuition fee increases. Some, such as the University of Chester, already sponsor free schools but have had little success in raising standards. But what makes this policy confusing is that the government currently wants to use university teaching excellence measures to grant fee increases. Will May\u2019s announcement on requiring universities to support schools replace or supplement that? And will the costs of support be met from undergraduate tuition fees, as other access schemes are?</p> <h2>Who will open new grammar schools?</h2> <p>A difficult question to answer at this point. The former education secretary Michael Gove took away local authorities\u2019 powers to open new schools. Most obviously, the government would like academy chains to sponsor or build new grammar schools \u2013 and some chains may see it as a way of reviving struggling schools. Whether leading chains such as Ark and Harris follow suit is not clear.</p>",

Tanzania, Uganda, Mozambique and C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire also have heavy burdens of disease. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2cef3e71cb9cb0702fe729b8d8984f58b26bce11\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2cef3e71cb9cb0702fe729b8d8984f58b26bce11/0_318_4842_2905/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A mother holds her baby as she receives a malaria vaccine in Kombewa, Kenya.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A mother holds her baby as she receives a malaria vaccine in Kombewa, Kenya.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Karel Prinsloo/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2016/apr/25/insecticide-resistant-mosquitoes-biting-back-malaria-death-rates\">Malaria menace: when insecticide-resistant mosquitoes bite back | Cl\u00e1r N\u00ed Chonghaile</a> </p> </aside>  <p>With resistance building to the best available drug, artemisinin, and the first-ever vaccine providing only low-level protection, new tools are needed, but most important is the sort of determination shown by Sri Lanka\u2019s government.</p> <p>\u201cEradication is the only sustainable solution to malaria,\u201d Bill Gates said on the release of the report his foundation produced with the UN last September. \u201cThe alternative would be endless investment in the development of new drugs and insecticides just to stay one step ahead of resistance. The world can\u2019t afford that approach.\u201d</p> <p>The reason why Sri Lanka\u2019s success is so symbolic is because we have been here before. In 1955, the UN committed to ending the scourge of malaria. It was optimistic because it thought there were effective tools. The pesticide DDT had been found to kill the mosquitoes that were spreading the disease in US army camps in the Pacific during the second world war. Widespread use of DDT and the drug chloroquine drove malaria out of many countries in the Americas, Europe and parts of Asia.<br></p> <p>But it all fell apart. There was no real attempt to tackle malaria in sub-Saharan Africa because it was thought to be too difficult. Elsewhere, elimination fell foul of the problem that has bedevilled all malaria control efforts: resistance of the malaria parasite to drugs and of the mosquitoes to pesticides. Then in 1962, Rachel Carson\u2019s blockbuster Silent Spring was published, alerting the world to the environmental devastation wreaked by DDT. The UN\u2019s malaria eradication plan was officially scrapped in 1969.</p> <p>Sri Lanka had been so close. Two million cases a year had dropped to just 17 in 1963. But when control efforts ended, the numbers surged back up and malaria was endemic once more. By 1998, there were more than 250,000 cases a year.</p> <p>\u201cIn the world of malaria, Sri Lanka carries a special weight,\u201d Alonso said. \u201cIt is often cited as the example of what happened during the first malaria eradication programme. They didn\u2019t complete the job and malaria came back with a vengeance. We need to learn from the past so we don\u2019t repeat the mistakes.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/2016/feb/10/should-we-wipe-mosquitoes-off-the-face-of-the-earth\">Should we wipe mosquitoes off the face of the Earth?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Elimination means the end of malaria in a country or region. The aspirational talk is of eradication: \u201cmaking the parasite disappear from the face of the planet\u201d, Alonso said.</p> <p>Realistically, he said, the tools, knowledge or physical resources were not available to do that. But as one country after another succeeded in eliminating malaria, it was possible they would obtain all of those things and be on track to end the disease.</p> <p>Eradication has been achieved in only one disease so far: smallpox. The eradication of polio is so close and yet so far, with small numbers of cases in just a few countries but also a constant sliding back, as seen recently in Nigeria, which had been considered polio-free.</p> <p><em>Additional reporting by Dinitha Rathnayake</em><br></p>",
  "<p>Rows over what photographs Facebook will permit on its vast social network are nothing new: its no-nudity picture policy has caused controversy before due its less than subtle approach.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/sep/09/facebook-deletes-norway-pms-post-napalm-girl-post-row\">Facebook deletes Norway PM's post as 'napalm girl' row escalates</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Apart from the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/sep/08/facebook-mark-zuckerberg-napalm-girl-photo-vietnam-war\">deletion of the Pulitzer-prize winning photograph</a> of a napalm attack in southern Vietnam, images of breastfeeding are frequently removed. In 2008, the company banned and removed any such images that showed nipples, causing a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2008/dec/30/facebook-breastfeeding-ban\">backlash and protests from tens of thousands of mothers</a>.</p> <p>The company\u2019s image censorship guidelines <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2012/feb/21/facebook-nudity-violence-censorship-guidelines\">were leaked to the press in 2012</a>. They specifically called for reviewers to remove images of breastfeeding if the nipples were exposed but to allow \u201cgraphic images\u201d of animals if shown in the \u201ccontext of food processing or hunting as it occurs in nature\u201d, resulting in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/feb/22/facebook-no-nipples-rule-breastfeeding\">further outcries</a>. The company <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/mar/16/facebook-policy-nudity-hate-speech-standards\">clarified its guidelines</a> on nudity in 2015, but has not changed its policy.</p> <p>Facebook says its policies are aimed at stopping pornography and abuse. The latter is a serious problem on some social media \u2013 in the UK earlier this week the director of public prosecutions, Alison Saunders, said prosecutions relating to stalking and harassment were at record levels in England and Wales because so much was being conducted online.</p> <p>Facebook says it uses both automated systems and human reviewers before taking action. Users of the social network are encouraged to actively report, via onsite tools, images they think could contravene Facebook\u2019s \u201ccommunity standards\u201d.</p> <p>An automated system collates those reports and flags images to human reviewers who determine if they breach the site\u2019s guidelines, which specifically outlaw nudity.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/communitystandards\">Facebook says</a>: \u201cWe restrict the display of nudity because some audiences within our global community may be sensitive to this type of content \u2013 particularly because of their cultural background or age.</p> <p>\u201cWe remove photographs of people displaying genitals or focusing in on fully exposed buttocks. We also restrict some images of female breasts if they include the nipple, but we always allow photos of women actively engaged in breastfeeding or showing breasts with post-mastectomy scarring.\u201d</p> <p>Should content be found to contravene Facebook\u2019s rules, it is deleted and accounts can be banned or removed. The company says the biggest problem is that for reasons of fairness and speed \u201cit is essential that we have policies in place that our global teams can apply uniformly and easily when reviewing content\u201d. That means one global guideline for all, regardless of local sensibilities.</p> <p>Exceptions should obviously be made in some circumstances, but Facebook\u2019s problem is when and where those one-offs should be considered and how not to allow, in its eyes, undesirable content through.</p> <p>Zuckerberg continues to claim that Facebook is not a media company, just a technology company. But it is one with arguably more power than any other organisation on the planet for influencing the news agenda through promotion or censorship.</p>",

  "<p><strong>My husband and I have been married for nearly a decade. We\u2019ve had some difficult things to deal with over the years. We also had children in rapid succession, which has been wonderful but very hard work. I felt I was increasingly struggling, particularly as his tendency is to be very negative and critical of me. I felt I was looking after the children, working, supporting him and still, for him, I wasn\u2019t working hard enough or paying enough attention to the house or children. </strong></p> <p><strong>He would find fault with everything I did and talk about me \u201cabandoning\u201d the children for work. If I tried to protest about this or other things that upset me, he would point out that I was wrong or didn\u2019t understand or just stop talking to me until I apologised. I did still feel I loved him and was trying to hold it all together until a year ago when I sort of broke down and said I couldn\u2019t do it any more. His reaction was to say I was depressed. We went to Relate, but he stopped going when the counsellor said he was controlling and felt the relationship had characteristics of domestic abuse. </strong></p> <p><strong>I suggested we separate for a while just so I could get some peace and headspace back but that triggered a tirade of criticism of me, how I\u2019ve hurt him and the children, till I\u2019m absolutely in bits. Mediation triggered the same response. We\u2019re now with another therapist that he\u2019s found but I\u2019m struggling with the sessions, feeling panicky and worn down as it seems like however much I say this is hurting me, the emphasis is on finding a way for us to be together again.</strong></p> <p><strong>I don\u2019t know what to do. I don\u2019t even know how to get to a place where doing something seems possible. Sometimes it seems easiest to give in and try to make everyone happy.

Your longer letter was desperate. What I have reproduced above is what you said I could without you being identified, so there is much I cannot refer to.

This is completely understandable but you have to ask yourself what will happen if you do nothing? Imagine five, 10 years from now.</p> <p>You do need to talk to a domestic violence adviser who understands what you are going through, who won\u2019t minimise how you feel or say it\u2019s your fault.

  "<p><sup>\u201c</sup>Twenty-five minutes. Be ambitious.\u201d This was the brief I was given two years ago by Rambert when they asked me to make a work to celebrate the company\u2019s 90th birthday in 2016. I had previously been a dancer with Rambert and left in 2013 to focus on choreography and producing. I have choreographed works inspired by music, sculpture, painting, architecture, literature and even a wallpaper collection. However, I wanted this new work to be more personal and at its core I wanted it to celebrate the richness that comes with freedom of movement.</p> <p>I was born in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/apr/08/upper-silesia-flags-up-independence\">Silesia</a>, a region in Poland that constantly changed hands between Poland and Germany up until the end of the second world war, and am part of a generation that grew up under martial law in the wake of the solidarity movement. I have vivid memories of the consequences of the west/east divide and Poland\u2019s isolation \u2013 the rations, the \u201cquests\u201d to secure basic necessities, the absurdity of these situations and the humour that helped us cope.</p> <p>Some of my closest relatives had left Poland in the decades after the war and for years we did not know when we would see each other again. When the iron curtain came down it was the promise of peace and the freedom of movement between countries that mattered most to me. I wanted to live, learn and work where my abilities and talents would be the best match, where cities and people inspired me to stay. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3e1af996b93698285407279fd7fb72859983dec2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3e1af996b93698285407279fd7fb72859983dec2/252_231_2069_2586/800.jpg\" alt=\"Rambert rehearse Flight.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rambert rehearse Flight.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Foteini Christofilopoulou/Foteini Christofilopoulou 2016</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In dance, I wanted to watch and work with artists I had admired from a distance for so long. Proud of my home country\u2019s heritage, I did not want to be defined by nationality, race or religion. I lived and worked in Germany, Denmark, Singapore, Sweden and, since 2006, the UK.</p> <p>While I was away pursuing my professional ambitions, Poland fulfilled its aspiration to become a member of the EU. They did this without me, though secretly I like to think that some cultural advocacy by those living abroad might have helped to make the case.</p> <p>The inspirations behind the new work, <em>Flight</em>, include the aesthetics of mass movement and the crossover with the natural world \u2013 the swarms and seemingly chaotic, yet inherently synchronised patterns, of navigation.</p> <p>An important source for me was the work of artist, writer and film-maker <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/shaun-tan\">Shaun Tan</a>. His fantastical illustrated worlds convey the sense of arriving at a new place that is both strange and familiar. The work also inspired a choreographic composition, where each scene can tell its own story, the way you might look at a photo album.</p> <p>Early in the creative process I overheard a conversation between foreign construction workers on a London bus. It reminded me of a play by the late Polish dramatist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/aug/21/slawomir-mrozek\">S\u0142awomir Mro\u017cek</a>, <em>The \u00c9migr\u00e9s</em>, in which two characters share a basement room in a house in an unnamed country that\u2019s not their own. This study of contrasting, yet mutually dependent personalities reaffirmed my sense that what brings us together and what divides us goes beyond national traits and stereotypes. The play, and what I heard of the workers\u2019 living conditions, became an important source of inspiration for the last section of <em>Flight</em>.</p> <p>This final scene can be performed by a cast of two women, two men or a mixed cast of female and male dancers. Breaking some of the habits within the choreographic language, and looking at how the gender roles can be balanced, was an important part of my process. I hope to guide the viewer towards an interpretation that goes beyond the immediate, romantic associations we commonly share when watching a couple perform an emotionally charged sequence. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Talent travels \u2013 there are 12 nationalities among Rambert\u2019s 22 dancers, including seven different EU countries</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Other experiences from my travels have influenced and helped to inform <em>Flight</em>. The first was the memory and atmosphere of a holding room or waiting room, a sort of limbo between the home you have left behind and the unknown stretching out before you. Working with composer Kate Whitley, I wanted to translate this feeling by layering the meditative, almost lethargic pace of these spaces with the dynamism of everyday frenetic activity that keeps us alive.</p> <p>I was also conscious of the borders we create through the endless replacement of one set of limitations with another. <em>Flight</em> uses these shifting environments, where one space opens up as another one shuts its doors, with the help of a set made up of moving panels and projections of urban and natural environments designed by Luke Halls.</p> <p>Last are my own reflections on the shifting perspectives within the UK and the rest of Europe. How quickly and unexpectedly the political context in which this work has been made has evolved. I finished choreographing <em>Flight</em> on the day that the outcome of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/eu-referendum\">UK EU referendum</a> was announced.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3d7864ba79427bb1407b6c84be84944b56b271d3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3d7864ba79427bb1407b6c84be84944b56b271d3/0_411_2848_1709/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Malgorzata Dzierzon\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Shifting perspectives \u2026 Malgorzata Dzierzon.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Renaud Wiser</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Dance as a form of expression has a unique ability to cross borders. Of the artists you see on stage, many were born and trained in the UK, others bring their talents and experience from overseas. Rambert itself was founded by a Polish immigrant Marie Rambert in 1926. Today, there are 12 different nationalities among Rambert\u2019s 22 dancers, including seven different EU countries. Their diversity brings a unique perspective, skill, personality and experience.</p> <p><em>Flight</em> is not a political statement. Twenty-five minutes of choreography is not a space vast enough to tell everyone\u2019s story. But my ambition for the piece is to create and hold a place where one is free to imagine and dream beyond physical borders and our own limitations. </p> <p><em>\u2022 Flight</em> is part of a Rambert triple bill at the Lowry, Salford, 28\u201330 September, and at Sadler\u2019s Wells, London EC1R, as part of <em>Contemporaries</em>, 7\u20138 November. <a href=\"http://www.rambert.org.uk/\">rambert.org.uk</a>.</p>",
  "<p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/paralympics-2016\">2016 Paralympics</a> in Rio may feature more disabled athletes than ever before, but it\u2019s not just on the field or in the pool that the Games are making their mark. </p> <p>Channel 4 says its 11-day coverage of the 15th Paralympic Games will be produced by the largest group of disabled people, both on and off screen, ever assembled.

The Paralympics shows what we are willing do to.\u201d</p> <p>The opening ceremony on Wednesday evening was fronted by the BBC security correspondent, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2005/apr/19/saudiarabia.broadcasting\">Frank Gardner</a>, who uses a wheelchair after being shot in Saudi Arabia a decade ago, alongside presenter Krishnan Guru-Murthy.</p> <p> On Thursday morning the first block of programming was hosted by presenter and former wheelchair basketball player <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/aug/18/ade-adepitan-disabled-kids-wild-cool\">Ade Adepitan</a> and the ex-royal marine <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/arthur-williams\">Arthur Williams</a>.</p> <p> Other presenters include JJ Chalmers, another former marine, as well as both current and former Paralympians who will work with able-bodied stars such as Clare Balding, who fronts the evening highlights show.</p> <p> Although viewing figures for the Paralympic opening ceremony were down on 2012, they have held up better than figures for the main games on the BBC. More than 2 million tuned into Wednesday night\u2019s broadcast, about a quarter of 2012\u2019s audience. In contrast, last month\u2019s Olympics opening ceremony could barely manage more than a 10th of its 2012 audience, and at a peak of 3.8 million viewers didn\u2019t hugely outpace Wednesday night\u2019s event.</p> <p>Channel 4\u2019s head of events and sport, Ed Havard, said the broadcaster was determined to build on the success of 2012, where about half of those presenting were disabled.</p> <p>\u201cWe made a really significant breakthrough in 2012 by having prominent disabled talent on screen. We made a decision that in 2016 we needed to take it to the next level. Making that commitment to make sure we had the largest collection of disabled on-screen talent in history was a massive dialling-up.\u201d</p> <p>A big change, said Havard, was that while in 2012 disabled presenters were paired with able-bodied peers, this year large chunks of Channel 4\u2019s coverage is fronted by teams of entirely disabled stars. </p> <p>It\u2019s not just in front of the camera that disabled people are becoming more involved. Sunset and Vine, the independent production company producing the coverage for the channel, has 20 disabled staff on the production team in Rio, about 15% of the total of 131.</p> <p> Of those 20 staff members, 17 came through Channel 4\u2019s Rio production trainee scheme. One of them is Dan Goulding, who has cerebral palsy affecting his lower body movement. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/aug/18/ade-adepitan-disabled-kids-wild-cool\">Ade Adepitan: 'We got up to crazy things \u2013 disabled kids were wild and cool'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cI honestly can\u2019t believe I\u2019m here in Rio working on the Paralympics,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve always wanted to work on massive sporting events so to be actually doing that so early in my career is a little bit surreal.\u201d</p> <p>Goulding has had his contract as broadcasting assistant at BBC sport news extended and is returning there after the Games.</p> <p>Havard said one of the most encouraging things about this year has been the level of support the scheme has received across the industry, with everyone from the BBC to small independents providing on-the-job training for disabled production staff. </p> <p>Able-bodied presenters from Channel 4 and at other broadcasters have also mentored those appearing on screen.</p> <p>Havard insisted the legacy of hosting the Paralympics in London four years ago has permeated the rest of the channel, normalising disability. He pointed to the comedy show <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2012/sep/05/the-last-leg-tasteless-awkward-funny\">The Last Leg</a>, which started during the 2012 Games before going weekly, and returns to broadcast nightly from Rio.</p> <p>Although research by the disability charity <a href=\"http://www.scope.org.uk/press-releases/rj-mitte-calls-more-disabled-people-tv\">Scope</a> published last month found that 77% of disabled people thought the 2012 Paralympics had helped perceptions of people with disabilities, it also found that more than 80% of respondents still did not think they were well represented on TV or in the wider media.</p> <p>However, another of the production trainees, Laurie Lawira, who moved to the UK from Australia last year after working in production in Sydney, was confident this year\u2019s games could continue to help more people with disabilities get into TV.</p> <p>\u201cThe industry already has the structures to be inclusive but it often lacks openly promoting and following through with opportunities. Schemes like the Channel 4 traineeship go a long way to address this and is a great step.</p> <p>\u201cIf a manager who previously would not consider taking on a person with a disability has changed his or her attitude, this has made a long-term impact,\u201d he said. \u201cIf disability moves from back of mind to front in all our daily attitudes \u2013 how we treat our colleagues who may be in a wheelchair, or visually impaired or have cerebral palsy \u2013 then we have made a long-term impact.\u201d</p> <p>Dan Goulding also said it was in the interests of the television industry to learn from and change in response to events like the Paralympics .</p> <p>\u201cThe only way to help create more diverse content for the audience is to have a more diverse workforce,\u201d he said. \u201cSo whether that\u2019s people who are able-bodied or disabled, male or female, people from different backgrounds, it\u2019s important everyone brings their individual ideas or fresh twists to current ideas and so allow us to create content to suit the audience.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>JD Wetherspoon\u2019s Eurosceptic chairman has attacked the political and economic establishment for doom-laden predictions about the impact of leaving the EU that he said have turned out to be false.</p> <p>Tim Martin took aim at David Cameron, FTSE 100 chief executives, the governor of the Bank of England, City economists and Goldman Sachs in a tirade accompanying the pub chain\u2019s annual results. He also disparaged the CBI, the International Monetary Fund and the OECD.</p> <p>\u201cThe overwhelming majority of FTSE 100 companies, the employers\u2019 organisation CBI, the IMF, the OECD, the Treasury, the leaders of all the main political parties and almost all representatives of British universities forecast trouble, often in lurid terms, for the economy in the event of the leave vote,\u201d Martin said.</p> <p>\u201cWhat I call \u2018scare story one\u2019 was that the act of voting leave would cause an immediate and profound downturn in the economy, and that\u2019s been proved to be entirely false.\u201d</p> <p>He said Wetherspoon\u2019s trading had improved since the end of its financial year and suggested that this was caused by sporting success, better weather and the referendum result. Pre-tax profit, excluding one-off items, for the year to 24 July rose by 3.6% to \u00a380.6m, on sales that increased by 5.4%. <br></p> <p>Martin criticised Cameron and the former chancellor George Osborne for predicting that families would <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/apr/18/eu-referendum-reality-check-uk-households-worse-off-brexit\">eventually be \u00a34,300 worse off</a>, mortgage rates would rise and house prices would fall after a vote for Brexit. Mark Carney, the Bank\u2019s governor, supported these claims \u201cin terms\u201d, he said. </p> <p>Martin, a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/mar/26/staying-in-eu-bad-for-small-businesses-says-wetherspoon-chief\">longstanding critic of the EU</a>, attacked Paul Johnson, the director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, for saying it was a given that economists were correct <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/may/25/ifs-brexit-extend-austerity-budget-deficit-eu-referendum\">in predicting malign consequences</a> from a vote to leave.<br></p> <p>\u201cThis is a strange argument to advance, since consensus forecasts from economists, who generally failed to forecast the last recession or the catastrophic flaws of the euro, are almost always delusional,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Economic surveys since the referendum on 23 June have been mixed. A report showing a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/sep/01/uk-factories-bounce-back-brexit-shock-eu-referendum-manufacturing-sector\">recovery in the services industry</a> during August followed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/sep/01/uk-factories-bounce-back-brexit-shock-eu-referendum-manufacturing-sector\">a </a>rebound for manufacturing and high street spending. But economists have said the UK <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/sep/07/slowing-gdp-growth-bolsters-fears-of-uk-recession\">could still slip into recession</a> and have warned that higher prices and slowing investment will eventually take their toll.</p> <p>Martin said: \u201cThey [the experts] didn\u2019t say \u2018in the long run\u2019. The Treasury said interest rates would immediately go up and that it would cause so much uncertainty that unemployment would go up, and there would be an immediate and severe shock. There is only one thing that is definitely true and that is democracy is better for your economy.\u201d</p> <p>Rival pub operator and brewer Greene King was warier about the economy than Martin. In a trading update, the company said consumer confidence and leisure spending were threatened by the referendum result \u201cand we are alert to a potentially tougher trading environment ahead\u201d.</p> <p>Having been proved wrong about the damaging effects of a Brexit vote, Martin said, the establishment was raising unnecessary fears about whether Britain could do a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/aug/08/uk-could-clinch-trade-deal-with-eu-within-two-years-says-expert\">trade deal with the EU</a> and that trade would continue with or without a formal agreement.</p> <p>\u201c\u2018Scare story two\u2019 is that if we don\u2019t join the single market, we are in deep trouble, and that is across mainstream economists. That is also in my view absolute twaddle,\u201d he said.</p>",
  "<p>Douglas Carswell is not just one of Ukip\u2019s most unusual members \u2013 although that is quite a distinction in itself. He is also one of the most unusual MPs I have ever met.</p> <p>The member for Clacton believes political parties are the enemy of democracy, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/aug/28/douglas-carswell-ukip-defects-tory-mp-byelection\">yet has represented not one but two</a> since entering parliament in 2005. Ukip signed up to the Leave.eu camp, but its sole MP campaigned for Vote Leave. \u201cI\u2019ve got huge admiration and respect for Nigel [Farage], and I\u2019m not going to say anything unkind at all,\u201d he tells me, but he says that, had his party leader had been in charge of the official leave campaign, the referendum would have been lost, and he likens him to an irrelevant comedian. The last time Carswell spoke to Farage was before the referendum. The free market, libertarian rightwinger is more interested in offering his counsel to \u201csensible\u201d Labour MPs, if and when they are deselected by Corbynistas. Yet he reconciles all these contradictions with a philosophical clarity that, though highly maverick, is surprisingly coherent.</p> <p>He is in excellent spirits when we meet in parliament this week. The froideur I once observed towards that other defector, George Galloway, is strikingly absent; fellow MPs, among them his former colleagues in the Conservative party, offer warm smiles and greetings as we queue in the Portcullis House coffee shop. On TV, Carswell tends to have a ramrod sergeant majorish air about him, but in person, he is much more relaxed. Even as his party prepares for a leadership election this week that has laid bare its essential amateurism, the 45-year-old says he has never been happier than since 23 June. His cheerful verdict on this week\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/05/david-davis-vows-to-build-national-consensus-on-brexit\">Commons statement from David Davis</a>, the minister for Brexit, is: \u201cSo far, so good.\u201d</p> <p>Were Carswell in charge, I ask, what would his version of Brexit look like? \u201cWell, unless you want to become like North Korea, labour mobility is going to happen.\u201d He neither expects nor wants Brexit to reduce immigration, and thinks that within 40 years, the current level of labour mobility in London will be UK-wide. But in Carswell\u2019s ideal Brexit model, the public would be content, \u201cbecause the people, through the ballot box, would have control\u201d. Parliament would vote each year on how many work visas to issue, just as it currently does on how much tax to levy, and the immigrants we decided we wanted \u2013 doctors, bright students, farmworkers \u2013 could all come. \u201cWe\u2019d have a system of migration that people would accept. By advocating an end to the unrestricted freedom of movement, you\u2019re not advocating closing the borders.\u201d</p> <p>A large number of people who voted to leave the EU, I suggest, did so precisely because they thought it <em>did</em> mean closing the borders. He shakes his head firmly. \u201cThe prime reason why people voted to leave the EU was they wanted to take back control. It was not primarily immigration. The reason why there was such a fundamental strategic difference of opinion between the two campaign groups vying to run the leave side is precisely because one side believed, erroneously, <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-36167329\">that it was all about migration</a>. And, frankly, if that side had been put in charge of running the referendum, we would have lost 60-40.\u201d</p> <p>Many commentators thought it was only when Vote Leave began to scaremonger about immigration towards the latter stages of the campaign that it overtook remain. Carswell looks good humoured, but gives another shake of the head.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/03/ukip-leadership-woolfe-james-labour-weakness\">No matter who becomes Ukip leader, Labour will be the biggest loser | Matthew Goodwin</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cSince the referendum, some on the remain side have been very quick to say it was a nativist reaction against immigration. Not only is that not true, we knew that that couldn\u2019t win a referendum beforehand. Which is precisely why Vote Leave\u2019s campaign was optimistic, not angry, about immigration. It actually talked positively about immigration \u2013 I heard Boris Johnson and Michael Gove again and again and again emphasising the positives of migration. Let\u2019s not rewrite history. It is grossly unfair to Vote Leave to characterise it as somehow anti-immigration. It wasn\u2019t.\u201d</p> <p>I\u2019m not sure that is quite how I remember it, but to characterise the \u201cother side\u201d \u2013 Leave.eu \u2013 as anti-immigration would plainly not be unfair.</p> <p>\u201cBut they weren\u2019t the campaign,\u201d points out Carswell, looking faintly bemused. \u201cThey didn\u2019t run the campaign.\u201d He starts to laugh. \u201cYou know, Eddie Izzard campaigned for the remain side. You\u2019re not suggesting to me that I should take what Eddie Izzard said as a reflection of what remain wanted. Let\u2019s not look at our equivalent of the Eddie Izzards on our side and pretend that\u2019s what Vote Leave was campaigning for. The reason why Vote Leave won was precisely because it was the antithesis of those <a href=\"http://\">anti-Syrian migrant posters we saw Nigel unveiling</a> a few days before the referendum. If that way of campaigning had been allowed to define Euroscepticism, we would have lost catastrophically \u2013 and quite rightly and deservedly. I think we won only narrowly precisely because, during the campaign, posters like that did enormous damage.\u201d</p> <p>This would be a perfectly unremarkable opinion if Carswell were still a Tory MP. But he is talking about his own party\u2019s posters. What is he doing in a party that he thinks actively damaged the great political cause of his lifetime? His answer is simple. \u201cIf I hadn\u2019t triggered a byelection and joined Ukip, I don\u2019t think we\u2019d have got the promise of a referendum.\u201d Then isn\u2019t the job done? \u201cFor me personally, to a very large extent, it is.\u201d So why not now leave? He grins. \u201cI\u2019m having far too much fun. I\u2019m just going to carry on. I feel very cheerful, and I\u2019m going to carry on.\u201d</p> <p>I\u2019m struggling to understand how he can have fun in a party that produced the Breaking Point poster. \u201cOh, I thought it was truly awful. But such was the vitality of Vote Leave that even despite that repellent nativism we still managed to win.\u201d Before defecting to Ukip in 2014, Carswell explicitly said he \u201cwould never join a party that was racist\u201d. Weren\u2019t Ukip\u2019s posters racist? \u201cThe phrase I use is nativist.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e76375efd64858a46853cbfe277d36634ea78b8f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e76375efd64858a46853cbfe277d36634ea78b8f/0_0_3000_2000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Douglas Carswell canvassing in Clacton-on-Sea in 2014.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Douglas Carswell canvassing in Clacton-on-Sea in 2014.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Peter Macdiarmid/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It is a rather cunningly convenient distinction \u2013 and even arguably accurate \u2013 but the next thing he says is uncharacteristically specious. \u201cLook at the Labour party: there are some people who\u2019ve said some vile and antisemitic things. Are you suggesting that every Labour MP should leave their party?\u201d But Jeremy Corbyn hasn\u2019t personally unveiled posters saying we can\u2019t cope with any more Jews.</p> <p>The only other time Carswell starts to sound more like a conventional politician comes when I bring up the dramas surrounding Ukip\u2019s leadership election. The leading candidate, Suzanne Evans, was <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-36892561\">forced out of the race</a> after Farage suspended her for mysterious reasons. The second-favourite, Steven Woolfe, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/aug/03/ukip-leadership-steven-woolfe-excluded-from-ballot\">isn\u2019t on the ballot either</a>, following an equally mysterious failure to apply before the deadline. Woolfe insists he did submit his paperwork on time, prompting speculation that opponents within the party deliberately stalled it on the Ukip computer system. Carswell takes care to confine his comments to bland platitudes \u2013 \u201cI admire all those who are putting their names forward.\u201d</p> <p>When I ask about the party\u2019s future direction, however, he becomes intently animated.</p> <p>\u201cI hope that Ukip, having broken down the consensus on EU membership, now tries to break down other cartels,\u201d by which he means everything from housing associations to monetary policy. \u201cThese cartels all need breaking open. This is rich territory for Ukip. We\u2019re at a key juncture here. Either we become the British equivalent of the Northern League in Italy, we become angry, backward-looking, nativist and we\u2019ll be a rump. Or we say look, there\u2019s this huge opportunity here. The Tory party is weaker than they think they are. The Labour party is in meltdown because of Corbyn. The Lib Dems are on a holiday from history. This is our chance. We offer traditional Labour supporters a very compelling retail proposition.\u201d</p> <p>It is starting to sound more like a manifesto than an answer to a question. \u201cThere\u2019s this assumption among pundits and politicians in Westminster that the only way you appeal to traditional Labour voters is to offer them Fabianism. Thatcher beautifully understood that is not so. She allowed those people to buy their council houses, which meant she created a huge electoral alliance beyond her traditional base.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/15/brexit-how-a-fringe-idea-took-hold-tory-party\">Brexit: how a fringe idea took hold of the Tory party | Matthew d\u2019Ancona</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cThe equivalent of allowing people to buy their council houses is this: most houses have access to Netflix; they can allow their kids to watch whatever their kids want to watch. But they have zero control over their child\u2019s education. What if you gave mums and dads the legal right to request and receive control over their child\u2019s share of local authority funding? What if you allowed people to control their health budgets? This is potentially a vast area which could have huge traction. People have Netflix; they\u2019re used to the idea of self-commissioning.\u201d</p> <p>Is he sure Ukip is fertile soil in which to propagate these ideas? \u201cWell, it would require a boldness and an originality of thought that I hope is there \u2013 but may not be. It\u2019s precisely because we haven\u2019t developed these ideas that we\u2019re only on 11 or 12 points in the polls. If Ukip has a future, it is in embracing this agenda. And, if it does, it could hoover up a huge share of the market. There is a once-in-a-generational opportunity. You\u2019ve got a huge segment of the electorate that is unrepresented by lazy party cartels that treat their views with contempt, don\u2019t understand their aspirations and talk down to them. The single biggest cartel is the political parties.\u201d</p> <p>It sounds as if Carswell would like to see parties disappear altogether. \u201cParties are nine-tenths of the problem in our democracy,\u201d he agrees urgently. \u201cParties are the problem.\u201d</p> <p>Does he consider himself, I ask, more an independent than a Ukip MP? \u201cWell, what\u2019s the difference between the Ukip parliamentary party and just me at the moment? I mean, not a great deal!\u201d he hoots. \u201cSo yes, you could see it that way. But I\u2019ve never really felt bound by any party. I didn\u2019t always agree with the Conservative party.

Farage certainly thinks it is a bit rich to harness the support and machinery and funding of his party while disavowing so much of what it says. If Carswell thinks parties are the problem, why not quit and stand as an independent?</p> <p>\u201cBecause I\u2019m enjoying myself. I\u2019m having much too much fun.\u201d That makes him sound selfish and hypocritical, I point out. \u201cOK then. Because I\u2019m too excited about the party conference on Saturday.\u201d He laughs teasingly. \u201cNo really,\u201d he deadpans. \u201cBecause I\u2019m so looking forward to the party conference.\u201d Come off it, I say.</p> <p>\u201cOK.\u201d He is suddenly serious. \u201cAt some point, a party is going to come along, like the Labour party did in the 1890s, and it\u2019s going to break the cartel. And I would hate to climb off Ukip just before Ukip became the vehicle that did that. Does the political party that breaks the cartel come from the libertarian right \u2013 Ukip? I hope it does. But if we\u2019re not quick \u2013 and the window of opportunity is closing fast \u2013 I suspect it will come actually from a grassroots, non-Corbynista, Tristram Hunt-type left.\u201d</p> <p>And if it does, he says, he will be only too happy to help. Carswell is genuinely happy to help whoever first challenges the current party system orthodoxy. He thinks Labour will split, \u201cwhen the Corbynistas get around to deselecting some of the decent MPs\u201d, and says he would happily share with those MPs his insights from Clacton about winning byelections. \u201cI mean this very seriously. The techniques I learned, I\u2019d be very happy to share those with people on the left who wanted to escape from the tyranny of parties, too.\u201d</p> <p>He wouldn\u2019t join a new leftwing movement, he adds hastily. \u201cAnd they obviously wouldn\u2019t want me front of shop.

The ferocity of the Bulldogs in WA has further complicated what was already the most open postseason in a generation and whetted the appetite for what (on paper at least) should be the tie of the weekend.</p> <p>If you weren\u2019t aware of the recent history between these two storied clubs, you\u2019ve probably stumbled onto this page by accident (I hope you enjoy the VFL archive clips further up the page while you\u2019re knocking around). Whenever the Cats and the Hawks get together something special seems to happen. Let\u2019s hope history repeats tonight.</p> <p>The Cats ended the home and away season in second place, the Hawks third, but both were just percentage away from the ladder leading Swans. It\u2019s been that kind of a season. </p> <p>The perception throughout has been of Hawthorn doing just enough, with ready arguments that the triple-premiers were on their last legs and unable to cope without the loss of so much experience in recent months. Alastair Clarkson\u2019s mob are nothing if not bloody minded though, and they\u2019ve willed themselves across the line often enough to be three games away from an historic four-peat. </p> <p>The Cats are a tipster\u2019s nightmare.

  "<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2014/apr/22/1944-education-act-butler-policy-today\" title=\"\">RA Butler\u2019s 1944 education reforms</a> revolutionised access to post primary education. Every child who demonstrated a capacity to benefit from it would receive a free academic education, previously only available to those whose parents could pay for it. The basis of the policy was that of equality of opportunity based on merit; and hundreds of thousands of working-class children were to take advantage of it over the next 30 years.</p> <p>By the mid 1960s more than 3,000 grammar schools were educating, among others, a legion of working-class pupils. State grammars were offering a free education comparable to that of the independent schools, and their pupils were mounting this new ladder of upward social mobility to claim their rightful places in the professions, the arts and the sciences. The multiplicity of places available guaranteed a wide social mix, and feeder primary schools took pride in the number of their pupils who gained admission.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/sep/07/grammar-schools-expansion-disaster-social-mobility-tsar-alan-milburn\">More grammar schools would be a disaster, says social mobility tsar</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Against this background in 1967 Tony Crosland, Labour\u2019s education minister launched a campaign \u201cto destroy every fucking grammar school in England, Wales and Northern Ireland\u201d. His campaign was both ideological and political, seeking to advance the principle of equality of results, an attack on what he perceived as part of the social infrastructure of his conservative opponents. A purely educational policy of retaining the best and improving the rest would not have served his purpose. Henceforth excellence as the goal of an educational system would be replaced by a system whose value lay in being a tool for social and political engineering; a principle that has since plagued every level of education, from primary school to university.</p> <p>The success of the grammar school population then and now is based on traditional teacher-led instruction within a changing and developing curriculum of discrete subjects. Pupils are encouraged to be competitive, aspirational and independent in thought, while offering respect to the knowledge and experience of their teachers. Post-1967 the political drive towards all-ability comprehensive schools was accompanied by a move to a progressive style of teaching in which the role of the teacher was often reduced to that of a facilitator.</p> <p>Subjects became more generalised and the all-ability intake frequently resulted in a levelling down of pupil attainment. With this came a criticism of any form of pupil competition and a distaste for examinations and testing which might reveal inequality of results or inadequacy of teaching. The reduced status and authority of the teacher was reflected in the increasing levels of pupil indiscipline.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2016/sep/08/justine-greening-new-grammar-schools-not-a-return-to-the-past\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/5269f\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2701203\"            data-video-name=\"Justine Greening: new grammar schools will not be a return to the past \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"Parliament TV\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-57d1487be4b08465d44fe9d0\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/09/08/160907Grammar3_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/09/08/160907Grammar3.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/09/08/160907Grammar3_WebM.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2016/sep/08/justine-greening-new-grammar-schools-not-a-return-to-the-past\">Justine Greening: new grammar schools will not be a return to the past</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>By 1998 only 164 grammar schools remained and the Schools Standards and Framework Act of the same year prohibited the opening of any new ones. By 2006 it was evident to me that the comprehensive system which now accounted for the teaching of some 95% of post primary state pupils was failing. The accelerating decline in levels of outcome could no longer be disguised by the dumbing down of exams, generosity of marking and the introduction of new non-academic subjects to GCSE and A-level courses. Aspirational parents were fleeing the state system.</p> <p>At primary school stage the number of children leaving with low levels of literacy and numeracy, which put a permanent blight on their future education and social mobility, had become a scandal. On receiving the <a href=\"http://dera.ioe.ac.uk/5551/2/report.pdf\" title=\"\">2006 Rose report</a>, Labour education minister Alan Johnson declared that thousands of children had been betrayed. When <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/1175791.stm\" title=\"\">Alistair Campbell described many comprehensive schools as \u201cbog standard\u201d</a> and <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/education/7638091.stm\" title=\"\">Gordon Brown threatened to close schools if they did not achieve the very modest target of 30%</a> of their pupils gaining five GCSE grades A to C including English and maths, it was clear that something had to be done to arrest the rot.</p> <p>Against this background the demand for grammar school places was rocketing with an average of 10 to 12 applicants for each place. Even under Labour between 2002-08 the number of grammar school pupils increased by 30,000, the equivalent of 30 new grammar schools. This increase was within the existing 164 grammar schools.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The prime minister\u2019s policy can be seen as a way of re-enfranchising the disadvantaged</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Tony Blair\u2019s response to the crisis was the academies project, by which comprehensive schools were rebranded as \u201cacademies\u201d \u2013 a description normally applied to places of higher learning \u2013 and given a degree of self-governance. David Cameron merely extended the project while deputing Michael Gove to remedy the worst aspects of the curriculum and progressive teaching, with a programme that invoked the wrath of the educational establishment which continues to underwrite failure.</p> <p>Recent research has shown that, with the possible exception of in the London area, the academy project has brought little improvement to the comprehensive system. The latest government figures indicate that an average of more than two academies per week in England are <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-37297448\" title=\"\">facing formal intervention</a>. A <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/sep/07/academies-gcse-results-research-lse-epi\" title=\"\">report</a> by the LSE and the Education Policy Institute reveals that while sponsored academies show an initial improvement, this dissipates after three years and they return to their pre-academy level.</p> <p>A minority of comprehensives and academies are successful, but these are generally sited in areas of affluence where house prices in the catchment areas put them beyond the reach of aspirational working-class parents and as a result they are often characterised by having low numbers of pupils who receive free school meals. As Lord Adonis, a former Labour education spokesman <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Class-Act-Britains-Classless-Society/dp/0241137209\" title=\"\">put it</a>: \u201cSelection on merit has been replaced by selection on money and postcode.\u201d</p> <p>It is a palpable Aunt Sally to suggest that supporters of new grammar schools seek a return to a universal mandatory selection test; they do however assert that there is no educational basis for denying aspirational parents of whatever class the entirely voluntary choice of a grammar school education if their child would benefit from it.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/07/thatcher-grammars-poison-theresa-may-tories\">Thatcher knew grammars were poison.

The restoration of grammar schools to deprived areas must be accompanied by provisions for close liaisons with revitalised feeder primaries to identify and promote those children with the potential to benefit. Improving the quality of aspirational education in our primary schools is the foundation of all social mobility.</p> <p>The prime minister can take heart from the fact that a series of opinion polls carried out on behalf of the <a href=\"http://www.ngsa.org.uk/polls.php\" title=\"\">National Grammar Schools Association have shown a significant majority</a> in favour of the opening of new grammar schools.

  "<p>In Andrew Dominik\u2019s uncomfortably riveting documentary One More Time With Feeling \u2013 about the making of Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds\u2019 16th album \u2013 the singer describes a terrible event, which has become omnipresent. \u201cTime is elastic. We can go away from the event but at some point the elastic snaps and we always come back to it.\u201d<br></p> <p>That event, of course, was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/jul/15/nick-cave-son-arthur-dies-brighton-chalk-cliff-fall\">the death last July of his 15-year-old son, Arthur</a>, after he fell from a cliff. Cave has attempted to deal with his family\u2019s grief in the only way he knows. Thus, Skeleton Tree is a musical response to the unimaginable horror; while the recording sessions began before Arthur\u2019s death \u2013 much of the writing was completed beforehand \u2013 it\u2019s hard not to hear the album as reflecting Cave\u2019s emotional pile-up of shock, confusion and personal disintegration, especially in the intensity of the performances that postdate the tragedy. It\u2019s a record of unusual rawness, honesty and intensity. Where the pre-trauma, far more private Cave would have honed lyrics, shrouded meanings, tidied things up in mix or postproduction, Skeleton Tree has been largely left as it was born, mistakes and all, as an instinctive howl from the heart and gut.<br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/sep/05/one-more-time-with-feeling-review-film-nick-cave-andrew-dominik-venice\">One More Time With Feeling review \u2013 undeniably moving contemplation of loss</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The documentary sees Cave fretting that he should have strengthened his voice before entering the studio. However, as with, say, the dying <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FywSzjRq0e4\">Johnny Cash\u2019s version of Nine Inch Nails\u2019 Hurt</a>, the frailties, wounds and vulnerabilities in his voice give the record its strength and humanity.</p> <p>There aren\u2019t many, if any, precedents, but Eric Clapton\u2019s 1991 song <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxPj3GAYYZ0\">Tears in Heaven</a> was written in response to the death of his four-year-old son, Conor, also from a fall. But where Clapton found some comfort in ideas of heavenly reunions and eventual peace, Cave finds no such salvation or solution. In fact, one of Skeleton Tree\u2019s most powerful statements is its rejection of God and notions of easy healing, happy endings or even meaning.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9iGxoJnygW8\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/9iGxoJnygW8?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>This is, unsurprisingly, a very dark record, which captures a sort of post-traumatic stress disorder in which the Cave no longer knows what he will think from one moment to the next, vomits in the bathroom sink, sees bags growing under his eyes and for whom everyday mundanities have become a frightening ordeal: \u201cOh, the urge to kill somebody was basically overwhelming. I had such hard blues down there in the supermarket queues.\u201d However, there is also beauty, empathy and love as it veers between bewildered numbness and heartbreaking profundity.</p> <p>Some songs, such as brooding opener Jesus Alone, were written before events changed the album irrevocably, which makes the song\u2019s sledgehammer first line \u2013 \u201cYou fell from the sky, crash-landed in a field near the River Adur\u201d \u2013 shockingly prophetic. Nothing is ducked here; everything is bared or confronted and Cave\u2019s agonised plea \u2013 \u201cWith my voice I am calling you\u201d, over a background of industrial noise and wounded bird cries \u2013 makes for a powerful opener.<br></p> <p>At times, as on Rings of Saturn, Skeleton Key is almost pretty, but with a black undercurrent: that song views the inevitability of death and cruelty through the metaphor of a venomous insect. The plangent, synth-and-piano-led Girl in Amber is deceptively beautiful, but delivers a succession of blows as fleeting memories (\u201cYou kneel, lace up his shoes your little blue-eyed boy\u201d) are swept away by the enormity of loss: \u201cI knew the world would stop spinning now since you\u2019ve been gone / I used to think that when you died you kind of wandered the world / I don\u2019t think that any more.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Nick Cave\">  <iframe src=\"https://embed.spotify.com/?uri=spotify%3Aalbum%3A34xaLN7rDecGEK5UGIVbeJ\" width=\"300\" height=\"380\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>Anthrocene has echoes of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gy9Ipdvj7Ok\">the Doors\u2019 Horse Latitude</a> \u2013 it\u2019s an angry collage of sound whipped into a frenzy by an unforgiving, raging vocal \u2013 but some of the album\u2019s best moments tap into the almost transcendently eerie calm that follows grief. I Need You is astonishingly gorgeous: a song from a numb void where emotion has been drained but love flickers like a faraway spark. In the duet Distant Sky, Else Torp offers a fleeting solace in heightened senses and the new joys of the world around, before Cave shatters the peace with furious devastation: \u201cThey told us our gods would outlive us, but they lied.\u201d Some moments \u2013 the singer\u2019s cry over the sea in the title track, to be met by an empty echo \u2013 are almost too personal to bear, and it\u2019s hard to know who exactly he addresses in the album\u2019s final line, \u201cAnd it\u2019s all right now.\u201d</p> <p>Skeleton Tree will take its place in the racks alongside Justin Bieber or whoever, where it will sit like a gaping open wound. It will prove scant consolation to the singer that the worst kind of trauma has produced a piece of art that will surely prove unforgettable to all who hear it.</p>",
  "<p>The NHS is in danger of losing control of public debate around the sustainability and transformation plans (STPs). Days after the unnecessary secrecy around STP blueprints for change predictably backfired, with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/aug/26/nhs-plans-radical-cuts-to-fight-growing-deficit-in-health-budget\">lurid headlines about closures and cuts</a>, both NHS England and the government have been trying to get a grip on public understanding of what all this frantic management work is trying to achieve.</p> <p>At this week\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.england.nhs.uk/expo/\">Health and Care Innovation Expo</a> in Manchester, NHS England chief executive Simon Stevens said that in the next few days his organisation will be spelling out expectations on how the public will be involved in discussions.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/healthcare-network/views-from-the-nhs-frontline/2016/aug/26/nhs-plans-bring-benefits-barred-telling-public-sustainability-transformation-plans\">NHS plans could bring benefits but we're barred from telling the public</a> </p> </aside>  <p>This is a reversal of its previous position, which was to discourage STPs from publishing their draft plans. Meanwhile, at prime minister\u2019s questions, STPs put the prime minister, Theresa May, on the defensive, forcing her to reiterate the importance of taking into account the concerns of local people.</p> <p>The emerging plans are sensitive because a large number involve substantial changes to hospital services. It is far from clear how many of these will eventually go ahead, because there is a desperate shortage of capital funding with which to implement them. </p> <p>While some of the emerging hospital changes, such as those in south-west London, are trying to resolve disputes about the right shape of hospital services which have dragged on for many years, there is a serious risk in some areas of pursuing highly controversial changes of questionable benefit on dubious evidence. The King\u2019s Fund and others <a href=\"http://www.kingsfund.org.uk/press/press-releases/kings-fund-responds-reports-nhs-sustainability-and-transformation-plans\">warned</a> that major changes to acute services rarely deliver the anticipated substantial savings.</p> <p>It has been repeatedly proved that the quickest way to trigger massive opposition to hospital changes is to make them look like a secret plan that is to be sprung on the public. Yet the NHS keeps on doing it.</p> <p>Local political leaders are key. When councillors \u2013 not just the handful involved in the STP process \u2013 and MPs are involved early on, understand the case for change and feel their concerns are being taken seriously, they can be engaged in productive public debate. </p> <p>And what about patients? One of the guiding mantras of the NHS is supposed to be patient involvement, but at the Expo a small band of community campaigners gave voice to their complaint that service users are being excluded from these crucial discussions. With much of the work supposed to be completed by December, it is stretching credulity to believe that much more than token consultations with patient groups can take place.</p> <p>One of the difficulties around consultations faced by the STP teams is that some of them have made too little progress to present credible, watertight arguments.</p> <p>It is difficult to overstate the huge variation in STPs. A handful involve organisations that have been working together for years, have well-developed plans and are poised to deliver. These areas are likely to have already carried out extensive consultations through their clinical commissioning groups.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/aug/26/nhs-plans-radical-cuts-to-fight-growing-deficit-in-health-budget\">NHS plans closures and radical cuts to combat growing deficit in health budget</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Others are trying to work to unfamiliar boundaries and admit privately to having little more than \u201cplans to have plans\u201d. Public understanding of the issues is minimal, the evidence base is thin and they have little of substance to discuss. It is these ones at the back of the queue that are most nervous about consultations.</p> <p>The crucial error NHS England has made is to allow the process to be seen almost entirely through the lens of cuts, obscuring the vast amount of work underway to reshape services around the needs of patients, particularly in the community.</p> <p>As NHS staff giving talks at the Expo proved, across the country from pharmacy management in Wessex to musculoskeletal services in Wigan, clinicians, managers and commissioners are delivering the vision captured in the <a href=\"https://www.england.nhs.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/5yfv-web.pdf\">Five Year Forward View</a> of a patient centred NHS \u2013 and driving up productivity along the way.</p> <p>But the lethal combination of unnecessary secrecy and impenetrable management jargon has obscured the most important part of the story \u2013 that the health and care system would still need drastic reform even if it was awash with money.</p> <p><strong><a href=\"https://register.theguardian.com/healthcare-professionals/?CMP=dis-166\">Join the Healthcare Professionals Network</a> to read more pieces like this.

For five years, he had been methodically sifting through internal CIA accounts of its infamous torture program, a process that had begun after the committee learned \u2013 thanks to a New York Times article, not the agency \u2013 that a senior official had destroyed videotapes that recorded infamously brutal interrogations. The subsequent committee inquiry had deeply strained a relationship with Langley that both sides badly wanted to maintain. The source of that strain was simple: having read millions of internal emails, cables and accounts of agency torture, Jones had come to believe everything the CIA had told Congress, the Bush and Obama White Houses and the public was a lie. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/09/dan-jones-cia-torture-cover-report-senate\">Senate investigator breaks silence about CIA's 'failed coverup' of torture report</a> </p> </aside>  <p>There was one document in particular that proved it. Jones and his team had found it years before, placed mysteriously onto a shared computer network drive the Senate intelligence committee investigators were using in northern Virginia, not far from CIA headquarters. But they hadn\u2019t appreciated its full significance until the agency, in an attempt at refuting a report that was still far from publication, told Barack Obama\u2019s staff that the committee was pushing a hysterical interpretation of the agency\u2019s fateful post-9/11 embrace of torture. The document, prepared for Leon Panetta when he was CIA director, had reached the same conclusions about the torture program that Jones had. As long as Jones had it, he would be able to show that the agency knew full well how brutal the torture was; how ineffective its torturers considered it to be; and how thoroughly the CIA had covered all of that up. </p> <p>As long as Jones had the document, that is. Lurking in the back of his mind was the event that had led him to devote five years of ceaseless work, through nights and weekends: the CIA had already destroyed evidence of torture. It did that before the Senate had launched an investigation, and long before that investigation had turned acrimonious. </p> <p>Inside the small room in Virginia the CIA had set up for the Senate investigators, Jones reached for his canvas messenger bag. He slipped crucial printed-out passages of what he called the Panetta Review into the bag and secured its lock. Sometime after 1am, Jones walked out, carrying his bag as he always did, and neglecting to tell the agency security personnel what it contained. After years of working together, no one asked him to open the bag. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--immersive\" data-media-id=\"fd6c9ed82f59e3ff35077ad63534ef26283125ac\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fd6c9ed82f59e3ff35077ad63534ef26283125ac/0_0_1300_500/1000.jpg\" alt=\"McClean, Virginia\" width=\"1000\" height=\"385\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <h2>Outside the CIA satellite office in Virginia</h2> <p>Jones walked to the parking lot until he found his black Porsche Boxster. He tossed the bag onto the passenger seat and drove across the Potomac river, not stopping until he reached the Hart Senate office building on Capitol Hill. It was hours before dawn, but Jones walked into the building, sped to the second floor where the committee did its work, and placed the locked bag into a committee safe. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We had crossed a bridge. For the first time we had knowingly violated a CIA agreement</p> <footer> <cite>Daniel Jones</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Jones, by accord, had significant access to classified agency material. He would not be leaking the Panetta Review to the public. He was ensuring its preservation so Congress could exercise its constitutionally mandated oversight on an agency with a vivid recent history of document destruction on precisely this issue. But Jones, in his first-ever interview, acknowledged to the Guardian: \u201cWe had crossed a bridge. For the first time we had knowingly violated a CIA agreement.\u201d </p> <p>It was an unfathomable turn of events, and it would have severe repercussions. Jones had years of training and experience handling classified material: before joining the Senate committee staff, he was an FBI counter-terrorism analyst. The Senate committee was not favorably inclined toward absconding with intelligence documents: its leadership was spending summer 2013 excoriating NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden as a traitor. But, Jones said: \u201cI was afraid [the document] would be destroyed \u2026 I was the one saying, \u2018We have to do this.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Jones takes \u201cfull responsibility\u201d for taking the document, but will not clarify who actually made the decision. Senators on the committee say they learned about it after the fact rather than directing him to take the document, and support the decision to this day.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t disagree with it. I mean, look, Director [John] Brennan tried very hard to cover up the Panetta Review,\u201d said Senator Ron Wyden, an Oregon Democrat and longtime intelligence committee member.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed element--supporting\" data-alt=\"Support the Guardian\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;html&gt; &lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt; &lt;body style=&quot;padding: 0px; margin: 0px; overflow: hidden;&quot;&gt; &lt;style&gt; @font-face { font-family: &quot;Guardian Egyptian Web&quot;; src: url(&quot;https://interactive.guim.co.uk/fonts/guss-webfonts/GuardianEgyptianWeb/GuardianEgyptianWeb-Semibold.eot&quot;); src: url(&quot;https://interactive.guim.co.uk/fonts/guss-webfonts/GuardianEgyptianWeb/GuardianEgyptianWeb-Semibold.eot?#iefix&quot;) format(&quot;embedded-opentype&quot;), url(&quot;https://interactive.guim.co.uk/fonts/guss-webfonts/GuardianEgyptianWeb/GuardianEgyptianWeb-Semibold.woff2&quot;) format(&quot;woff2&quot;), url(&quot;https://interactive.guim.co.uk/fonts/guss-webfonts/GuardianEgyptianWeb/GuardianEgyptianWeb-Semibold.woff&quot;) format(&quot;woff&quot;), url(&quot;https://interactive.guim.co.uk/fonts/guss-webfonts/GuardianEgyptianWeb/GuardianEgyptianWeb-Semibold.ttf&quot;) format(&quot;truetype&quot;), url(&quot;https://interactive.guim.co.uk/fonts/guss-webfonts/GuardianEgyptianWeb/GuardianEgyptianWeb-Semibold.svg#GuardianEgyptianWeb-Semibold&quot;) format(&quot;svg&quot;); font-weight: 700; font-style: normal; font-stretch: normal; }  @font-face { font-family: &quot;Guardian Text Egyptian Web&quot;; src: url(&quot;https://interactive.guim.co.uk/fonts/guss-webfonts/GuardianTextEgyptianWeb/GuardianTextEgyptianWeb-Regular.eot&quot;); src: url(&quot;https://interactive.guim.co.uk/fonts/guss-webfonts/GuardianTextEgyptianWeb/GuardianTextEgyptianWeb-Regular.eot?#iefix&quot;) format(&quot;embedded-opentype&quot;), url(&quot;https://interactive.guim.co.uk/fonts/guss-webfonts/GuardianTextEgyptianWeb/GuardianTextEgyptianWeb-Regular.woff2&quot;) format(&quot;woff2&quot;), url(&quot;https://interactive.guim.co.uk/fonts/guss-webfonts/GuardianTextEgyptianWeb/GuardianTextEgyptianWeb-Regular.woff&quot;) format(&quot;woff&quot;), url(&quot;https://interactive.guim.co.uk/fonts/guss-webfonts/GuardianTextEgyptianWeb/GuardianTextEgyptianWeb-Regular.ttf&quot;) format(&quot;truetype&quot;), url(&quot;https://interactive.guim.co.uk/fonts/guss-webfonts/GuardianTextEgyptianWeb/GuardianTextEgyptianWeb-Regular.svg#GuardianTextEgyptianWeb-Regular&quot;) format(&quot;svg&quot;); font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; font-stretch: normal; }  @font-face { font-family: &quot;Guardian Sans Web&quot;; src: url(&quot;https://interactive.guim.co.uk/fonts/guss-webfonts/GuardianSansWeb/GuardianSansWeb-Regular.eot&quot;); src: url(&quot;https://interactive.guim.co.uk/fonts/guss-webfonts/GuardianSansWeb/GuardianSansWeb-Regular.eot?#iefix&quot;) format(&quot;embedded-opentype&quot;), url(&quot;https://interactive.guim.co.uk/fonts/guss-webfonts/GuardianSansWeb/GuardianSansWeb-Regular.woff2&quot;) format(&quot;woff2&quot;), url(&quot;https://interactive.guim.co.uk/fonts/guss-webfonts/GuardianSansWeb/GuardianSansWeb-Regular.woff&quot;) format(&quot;woff&quot;), url(&quot;https://interactive.guim.co.uk/fonts/guss-webfonts/GuardianSansWeb/GuardianSansWeb-Regular.ttf&quot;) format(&quot;truetype&quot;), url(&quot;https://interactive.guim.co.uk/fonts/guss-webfonts/GuardianSansWeb/GuardianSansWeb-Regular.svg#GuardianSansWeb-Regular&quot;) format(&quot;svg&quot;); font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; font-stretch: normal; }  * { box-sizing: border-box; font-family: 'Guardian Egyptian Web'; color: #333; }  a { text-decoration: none; }  body { max-width: 420px; }  .contribute__wrapper { background-color: #f5f5f5; }  .contribute__header { background-color: #fb0; padding: 4px; border-top: 2px solid #333; }  .contribute__logo { position: relative; margin: 0; margin-bottom: 24px; display: inline-block; color: #333; z-index: 10; font-size: 26px; font-weight: 700; }  .contribute__body { padding: 4px; }  .contribute__paragraph { font-family: 'Guardian Text Egyptian Web'; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.4; margin: 0; margin-bottom: 24px; }  .contribute__button { background-color: #fb0; color: #333; position: relative; padding: 8px 40px 8px 12px; border-radius: 24px; display: inline-block; margin-bottom: 6px; }  .contribute__label { font-family: 'Guardian Sans Web'; }  .contribute__icon { position: absolute; right: 4px; top: 1px; }  &lt;/style&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;contribute__wrapper&quot;&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;contribute__header&quot;&gt; &lt;h1 class=&quot;contribute__logo&quot;&gt;Support the Guardian's fearless journalism&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;contribute__body&quot;&gt; &lt;p class=&quot;contribute__paragraph&quot;&gt;From mass surveillance to brutal interrogations, the Guardian's investigative reporting holds the powerful to account.

The episode would spill out publicly the following March, when top committee Democrat Dianne Feinstein, who had already taken a huge political risk in pushing the torture inquiry, accused the CIA on the Senate floor of triggering what she called a constitutional crisis. Both sides requested the justice department pursue a criminal investigation on the other. The bitterness would nearly overshadow a landmark report, a fraction of which was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2014/dec/09/cia-torture-report-released\">released to the public in December 2014</a>, that documented in chilling detail the depravations CIA inflicted on terrorism suspects after 9/11. </p> <p>The CIA has stopped defending its torture program but not its personnel. While it has reknit its relationship to the committee, thanks to a GOP leadership that has all but disavowed the torture investigation, it continues to maintain that the torture report is inaccurate. Obama, whose trusted aide John Brennan runs the CIA, kept the report at arm\u2019s length, with his administration declining even to read it. </p> <p>But the CIA has gone beyond successfully suppressing the report. In a grim echo of Jones\u2019s fears, the agency\u2019s inspector general, Langley recently revealed, destroyed its copy \u2013 allegedly an accident. Accountability for torture has been the exclusive province of a committee investigation greeted with antipathy by Obama. While Obama prides himself on ending CIA torture, the Republican presidential nominee, Donald Trump, has vowed if elected to \u201cbring back <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/feb/06/donald-trump-waterboarding-republican-debate-torture\">a hell of a lot worse than waterboarding</a>\u201d. Key CIA leaders defending the agency against the committee, including Brennan and former director Michael Morrell, are reportedly seeking to run Langley under Hillary Clinton. </p> <p>This is the inside story of the Senate investigation into torture and the crisis with the CIA it spurred. It is formed from interviews with critical players in the drama, supported by voluminous internal reports and publicly available documents. Jones agreed to provide new details but would not discuss classified information with the Guardian.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>When it came time for Brennan to talk publicly about the Senate inquiry, long after Jones\u2019s predawn drive, he spent five minutes fitting the CIA\u2019s torturers into the context of 9/11. But 9/11 changed Jones\u2019s life as well. </p> <p>A native of central Pennsylvania, Jones, now 41 years old, taught in Baltimore in his early 20s as part of the Teach for America program encouraging service in inner-city schools. After 9/11, he recalled, he wanted to influence public policy over the emerging war on terrorism, and sought work on Capitol Hill. An aide to Tom Daschle, then the Senate Democratic leader, advised Jones to instead spend several years at a counter-terrorism agency, like the CIA or FBI. The aide would eventually cross paths with Jones in a different capacity \u2013 he was Denis McDonough, the Obama confidant who would become White House chief of staff.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video element--showcase\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/sep/09/daniel-jones-senate-staffer-cia-spying-interview-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/527pj\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2702368\"            data-video-name=\"Daniel Jones: the Senate staffer spied on by the CIA \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"the guardian\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-57d1e96be4b07ac3d446a54f\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/09/08/20160907DANJONES_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/09/08/20160907DANJONES.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/09/08/20160907DANJONES_WebM.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/sep/09/daniel-jones-senate-staffer-cia-spying-interview-video\">Daniel Jones: the Senate staffer spied on by the CIA</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>Jones arrived at the FBI in 2003 and spent the next four years there. The bureau was in the midst of a transformation: a generation after Congress had drastically reduced its domestic intelligence-gathering functions, following Nixon-era scandals, 9/11 had compelled its re-entry into the business of pre-empting homegrown terrorists. Jones set up shop in the counter-terrorism division as an analyst, primarily focused on al-Qaida and Sunni extremist groups and occasionally traveling overseas for his work. At one point, he was even detailed to the CIA. </p> <p>But his future in the bureau was always limited, as he wasn\u2019t a special agent, the field operatives who form the heart of the FBI. Sticking to his plan, Jones arrived on the Hill in January 2007, where his intelligence credentials helped find him a place working for Jay Rockefeller, a West Virginia Democrat and the chairman of the Senate intelligence committee. </p> <p>Rockefeller told the Guardian that while Jones\u2019s FBI experience qualified him to work on counter-terrorism issues on the committee, Jones\u2019s time as a Baltimore teacher attracted Rockefeller\u2019s interest.</p> <p>\u201cHis decision to make this contribution before he began his career in national security told me something about his character and it was something to which I could relate. He impressed me then and I have only come to admire him more in the years since,\u201d Rockefeller, who retired from the Senate in 2015, said. </p> <p>The intelligence committee is a culture all to itself. Unlike most congressional panels, the vast majority of its work occurs in secret. The byzantine rules of classification restrict staffers who might bolster legislators\u2019 knowledge from accessing significant relevant information. Membership, particularly on committee leadership, instantly boosts the profile of ambitious legislators, who become de facto surrogates for intelligence officials on cable news. All of this means that a committee tasked as the primary avenue for imposing accountability on secret agencies faces the ever-present risk of becoming captive to the agencies they oversee. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"90e4805e4a21be2f1af37a851c0357ddeb49ce7a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/90e4805e4a21be2f1af37a851c0357ddeb49ce7a/549_255_1435_861/1000.png\" alt=\"Daniel Jones\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Each element of the 16-agency intelligence community responds to the committee differently. As every intelligence service carries an inherent risk of scandal, they all have an abiding interest in keeping the panel on its side. The National Security Agency, the most powerful and technically sophisticated aspect of US intelligence, tends to send briefers to the Hill who wax loquaciously about the complicated details of its digital surveillance \u2013 which lends them an advantage over legislators afraid to admit what they don\u2019t understand. The CIA, however, tends to duck uncomfortable questions by telling senators they\u2019ll send responses later, the better to ensure accurate answers, and secure in the knowledge that busy legislators won\u2019t often follow up. Yet its high-handed style tends not to provoke legislators who would prefer a close relationship with an agency many are inclined to see as performing unsavory tasks for the greater national good. </p> <p>The committee\u2019s internal politics also operate outside the partisan straightjackets that the broader Congress eagerly wears. Aside from the vanishingly few public hearings it holds \u2013 an annual threat briefing, a budget briefing, nominations for senior intelligence appointees \u2013 its work occurs in secret. That secrecy prevents the public from knowing the overwhelming amount of activity about its intelligence services. It also affords committee members the leeway to take positions in tensions with party leadership or to ask questions of intelligence briefers that don\u2019t track conveniently with what their more ideological constituents would prefer. While there is a limit to how bipartisan or cross-ideological the committee will behave \u2013 former staffers are quick to point out that their work still occurs on the hyper-partisan Hill \u2013 both senators and staff describe the closed-door committee work as a venue where unity concerning national security can occur. </p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s absolutely what people hope Congress is,\u201d Jones recalled. </p> <p>The torture report began in such a manner. </p> <p>In November 2005, a senior CIA official named Jose Rodriguez destroyed 92 videotapes depicting the brutal 2002 interrogations of two detainees, Abu Zubaydah and Abdel Rahim Nashiri. Rodriguez\u2019s tapes destruction remained a secret to his congressional overseers for two years, until a 6 December 2007 New York Times article <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/06/washington/06cnd-intel.html\">revealed it</a>; they barely even knew the CIA taped interrogations at all. Outrage was swift and, while tilted toward the Democrats, bipartisan, to include the \u00e9minences grises of the <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/22/washington/22intel.html\">9/11 commission</a>. Even the US justice department began an <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/11/09/AR2010110904106_2.html?sid=ST2010110904198\">ultimately fruitless inquiry</a>. The Senate committee, then controlled by the Democrat Rockefeller, demanded an explanation. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"efe57abe026f4ea565120df1ccf03594f197b56d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/efe57abe026f4ea565120df1ccf03594f197b56d/26_0_587_734/400.jpg\" alt=\"Abu Zubaydah.\" width=\"400\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Abu Zubaydah.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Michael Hayden, the CIA director, provided an assurance. The CIA did not destroy evidence, Hayden told them, because the agency had extensive records of the interrogations, from field cables, memoranda and internal emails. It was the first time the committee had learned about the documentation of one of the agency\u2019s major operations. Jones, a committee lawyer named Alissa Starzak and two Republican staffers were tasked with combing through Langley archives and documenting what would have been on the destroyed tapes. </p> <p>Both Jones and Starzak \u2013 who declined comment to the Guardian \u2013 knew they would be looking through a soda straw. (The GOP staffers stopped coming to Langley after two or three visits, Jones recalls.) The material they reviewed covered only April to December of 2002. It occurred around only one black site, in Thailand, and concerned just two detainees. The heavily redacted material went only one way: cables back to headquarters, containing nothing about what agency leaders instructed their field operatives to do. Yet the material was extensive: the paper documents the agency permitted the staffers to see looked to Jones like an Encyclopedia Britannica.</p> <p>What they found, over a half a year\u2019s work examining just two detainees\u2019 interrogations from the first year of the torture program, shocked them. It was widely known by 2008 that Abu Zubaydah was tortured. But Jones and Starzak did not expect to see internal accounts detailing, by the minute, what the CIA did to him. They didn\u2019t know, for instance, that interrogators had tortured him to the point that he would obey, like a dog, when they would snap their fingers, nor that they left a man suspected of knowing al-Qaida\u2019s secrets alone for 47 days. The cables describe Abu Zubaydah as kept naked, filthy, stinking, shaking with fear, shoved inside a filth-riddled wooden box, defecating on himself. Agency personnel, in the official communications, get emotional and request transfers rather than continue torturing men they come to believe lack relevant information on terrorism. It immediately raised the question of what the CIA was really doing to dozens of other detainees at its black sites. </p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t think the CIA even knew what they were giving us, to be honest,\u201d Jones said. </p> <p>\u201cThese cables were the most graphic of all the cables to exist. Later on, as you go through the program, the cables get less and less detailed. To the credit of the agency personnel who were working on it, they were very detailed. \u2026 Everything that we were told was basically the opposite of what happened.\u201d </p> <p>That detail gave Jones his first recognition of the gulf between what the CIA actually did and what it told everyone outside of Langley that it did. Jones ended up creating a 29-page Microsoft Excel spreadsheet of the early days of CIA torture. </p> <p>Behind closed doors in the Hart building, Jones presented his findings to the committee on 11 February 2009. Both Republicans and Democrats were shocked by \u201cthe incredible brutality of the program at a level beyond which anybody imagined,\u201d Jones said. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--immersive\" data-media-id=\"9b39305333e39d182f916668ed1757f46439ea6b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9b39305333e39d182f916668ed1757f46439ea6b/0_0_1300_500/1000.jpg\" alt=\"senate-building\" width=\"1000\" height=\"385\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">senate-building</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sam Morris/This is a test</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>The Hart Senate office building. 11 February 2009</h2> <p>\u201cAt the back of the report, for what we called the \u2018tapes investigation\u2019, the staff created a chart that depicted the most torturous 17 days of Abu Zubaydah\u2019s interrogation. It was almost a minute-by-minute chronology of what the CIA was doing to Abu Zubaydah, and how Abu Zubaydah reacted,\u201d recalled Rockefeller. </p> <p>\u201cI think everyone on the committee \u2013 Democrat and Republican alike \u2013 was quite taken by this section of the report. It was hard to deny the ineffectiveness of the CIA interrogations, the brutality, or the fact that the committee had been deeply misled by the CIA.\u201d</p> <p>Some senators, particularly Republicans, were taken aback at the idea that the CIA would perform such acts.

Part of Jones\u2019s new mandate was to assess whether the CIA \u201caccurately described\u201d its torture program within the Bush administration and to Congress. Still, some of the Republican members imposed limits on the investigation\u2019s scope: Jones couldn\u2019t look at the Bush White House, just the CIA. </p> <p>The announced inquiry came at an uncomfortable time for the CIA and the White House. Since Obama won the presidency in November, human rights groups had spent four months pressing for a reckoning with torture.</p> <p>While Obama shut down the torture program on his second day in office, he also said that his focus as president would be to \u201c<a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/12/us/politics/12inquire.html\">look forward as opposed to looking backwards</a>\u201d. A senior campaign aide and former senior CIA official, John Brennan, became his chief White House adviser for counter-terrorism, a signal that Obama did not wish to have antagonistic relations with Langley. His choice for CIA director, after Brennan\u2019s equivocations on torture raised red flags for liberals, was Leon Panetta, a longtime Democratic congressman and consummate insider. </p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0K27oIJlAlA\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"345\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/0K27oIJlAlA?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>President-elect Barack Obama in January 2009.</figcaption> </figure>   <p>Obama\u2019s eagerness to turn the page on torture alarmed some of his allies. The Democratic chairmen of the House and Senate judiciary committees, Patrick Leahy and John Conyers, were pushing for broad investigations into both torture and mass surveillance. </p> <p>In February 2009, Antonio Taguba, the army major general who blew the whistle on Abu Ghraib, joined a coalition of 18 human rights groups pressing Obama and the Democratic Congress for an <a href=\"http://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/news/2009/feb/18/detainee-commission-021809/\">independent truth commission</a> on torture. They had support from very <a href=\"http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB124052866000950327\">senior Democratic legislators</a>, including <a href=\"http://www.mcclatchydc.com/news/politics-government/article24535555.html\">House speaker Nancy Pelosi</a>, Senate judiciary chairman Patrick Leahy and House judiciary chairman John Conyers. Activists petitioned attorney general Eric Holder to <a href=\"https://www.aclu.org/news/quarter-million-americans-demand-torture-prosecutions\">appoint a special prosecutor</a> for the agency. </p> <p>If the White House and the CIA didn\u2019t like the intelligence committee looking into the CIA\u2019s recent past, they would like an unpredictable 9/11 Commission-style panel and an independent prosecutor far less. The secretive panel, with its longstanding ties to Langley and its Democratic leadership, seemed like a safer option. An added political benefit was the committee\u2019s new chair: Dianne Feinstein of California, who had a long history of <a href=\"http://www.salon.com/2007/09/23/feinstein/\">disappointing liberals over national security</a>.</p> <p>Still, the CIA had some caveats. </p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>Usually, when the Senate committee investigates the intelligence agencies, it does so on its home territory. The business of the committee, to include investigations, occurs in secure, locked rooms at the Hart building. Members and staff leave their phones outside; staff who lack the appropriate security clearances do not enter. The entire premise of the intelligence committees, established in the 1970s, was their unique fitness within Congress to handle classified material in order to provide accountability on secret agencies.</p> <p>Panetta wanted a different arrangement. The CIA was forecasting the provision of between three and six million pages of relevant documents. Panetta\u2019s aides voiced concern that they could not abide names of operatives, locations of black sites and countries cooperating in the torture program transiting to Capitol Hill. Either the committee would have to wait on the delivery of the documents until after the agency painstakingly redacted its material \u2013 a process with no defined endpoint and likely to last months, if not years \u2013 or it could set up shop in a satellite CIA facility in northern Virginia. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"46fc098d88879eb7f50244ed2d055df3c3c92e59\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/46fc098d88879eb7f50244ed2d055df3c3c92e59/0_279_5160_3096/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Leon Panetta\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">At CIA headquarters in Langley in February 2009.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: J Scott Applewhite/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cEvery other investigation the committee conducted when I was chairman was done from the intelligence committee\u2019s offices \u2013 offices that are fully secured and certified to hold the most sensitive and classified information that exists,\u201d said Rockefeller. </p> <p>\u201cThe CIA\u2019s detention and interrogation program was the exception.\u201d </p> <p>The proposed arrangement discomfited the committee. Both Jones and Louis Tucker, the GOP staff director, agreed that the investigation should unfold in the Hart building, the same as any the panel would conduct. </p> <p>Feinstein was giving their concerns teeth. Her meetings with Panetta, whose \u201c<a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/111/chrg/shrg52741/CHRG-111shrg52741.htm\">intelligence and integrity</a>\u201d she praised in his confirmation hearing that February, showed a hard edge. Behind closed doors, in early June, Feinstein pressed Panetta for access to documents. Panetta, a salty politician, raised his voice, referenced their long history together, and said she was asking for unprecedented access. Feinstein raised hers back, and threatened to send subpoenas to the CIA. Here were two fixtures of decades of California Democratic politics, sizing each other up to determine who would dominate whom.</p> <p>But the committee had to consider the reality of the task it was confronting. It had taken over a year to investigate just two interrogations related to the tapes, and in truth, primarily one, as Nashiri did not come into CIA custody at the Thai black site until December 2002, the tail end of the period Jones and Starzak investigated. The CIA did not produce any documents until the middle of 2008. How much time would they lose if they waited for the agency to redact at least 3m documents concerning more than 100 detainees? </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Everything that we were told was basically the opposite of what happened</p> <footer> <cite>Dan Jones</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The CIA offer came to look acceptable. Jones and his team would drive out to the satellite location. They would have an office, lit bright white and windowless, in its basement. While there, Jones believed, they would receive access to a computer network, known as RDINet \u2013 for \u201cRendition, Detention and Interrogation\u201d \u2013 hived off from the internet, accessible to them alone, onto which the CIA would place the documents. It was unusual, but they found, compared to the alternatives, they could live with it. Jones\u2019s team set to work at the site on 18 May. </p> <p>Days later, Panetta and Feinstein came to a final agreement on access. Several letters document their accord, with a final one from Panetta on 12 June saying \u201can agreement was reached between CIA and SSCI staff personnel regarding operating procedures for the SSCI review of material related to the CIA\u2019s detention and interrogation programs.\u201d The letter said the CIA would establish \u201ca walled-off network share-drive\u201d that only the Senate staff would access for work, and that \u201cCIA access to the walled off network shared drive will be limited to CIA information technology staff, except as authorized by the committee or its staff.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"d33d29227fdae8db471876524973ef8dce177ff4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d33d29227fdae8db471876524973ef8dce177ff4/0_0_1275_1650/773.jpg\" alt=\"CIA\" width=\"773\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Letter dated 12 June 2009 from CIA director Panetta to Dianne Feinstein.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: CIA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>An earlier accord, dated 28 May, also referred to establishing a \u201cshare-drive [that] can be segregated with only SSCI access and walled-off CIA IT administrators, except as otherwise authorized by SSCI.\u201d That document was titled Memorandum of Understanding Senate Select Committee on Intelligence\u2019s Review of CIA\u2019s Detention and Interrogation Program \u2013 something agency reviews would later claim, as controversy over the inquiry reached a crisis point, did not exist.</p> <p>Ironically for an agency whose concerns were premised on security breaches, now it had to hire IT contractors to set up the network for the committee staff. Documents did not actually arrive until 22 June, and then, they were maddeningly difficult to search through, as the agency insisted on using an obscure and not terribly functional search tool. The staff the CIA posted to liaise with the investigators were \u201copenly hostile\u201d, Jones said, and dragged their feet on responding to Jones\u2019s concerns.</p> <p>Then the CIA was hit by what seemed like a bombshell. In August 2009, US attorney general Eric Holder expanded the remit of the prosecutor looking at the tapes destruction, John Durham, to include the torture program, much as the Senate committee had. The justice department\u2019s new mandate was not as broad as the Senate\u2019s. It would only concern itself with torture that exceeded the boundaries set for the CIA by the Bush-era justice department. Still, for all of Obama\u2019s emphasis on looking forward and not backward, now the CIA had to face its greatest fear since launching the torture program: possible prosecution. </p> <p>Holder\u2019s decision, ironically, would ultimately hinder the committee more than the CIA, and lead to a criticism that the agency would later use as a cudgel against the Senate. </p> <p>Typically, when the justice department and congressional inquiries coincide, the two will communicate in order to deconflict their tasks and their access. In the case of the dual torture investigations, it should have been easy: Durham\u2019s team accessed CIA documents in the exact same building that Jones\u2019s team did. </p> <p>But every effort Jones made to talk with Durham failed. \u201cEven later, he refused to meet with us,\u201d Jones said. </p> <p>Through a spokesman, Durham, an assistant US attorney in Connecticut, declined to be interviewed for this story.</p> <p>The lack of communication had serious consequences. Without Durham specifying who at CIA he did and did not need to interview, Jones could interview no one, as the CIA would not make available for congressional interview people potentially subject to criminal penalty. Jones could not even get Durham to confirm which agency officials prosecutors had no interest in interviewing. \u201cRegrettably, that made it difficult for our committee to do interviews. So the judgment was, use the record,\u201d said Wyden, the Oregon Democrat on the panel.<br></p> <p>But when the Senate investigators discovered discrepancies between what the cables they read indicated and what CIA leaders represented internally or publicly, they would be unable to solicit answers from the people in question. </p> <p>Durham\u2019s investigation led to the first partisan break on the committee. The committee\u2019s vice-chairman and top Republican, Kit Bond of Missouri, informed Feinstein that GOP members and staff were withdrawing. The special prosecutor had put the committee \u2013 and CIA officials \u2013 in an untenable position, Bond said publicly on 25 September: \u201cWhat current or former CIA employee would be willing to gamble his freedom by answering the committee\u2019s questions?\u201d</p> <p>By then, the Republican staff had largely withdrawn from the investigation already, with many not bothering to show up to the Virginia facility. Feinstein had already complained about that to Bond in early April. And other strains were evident in the committee\u2019s bipartisanship: a top Republican aide, Kathleen Rice, maintained it would be too onerous to require the CIA to list for the investigators all its black-site detainees.</p> <p>Bond did not stop at withholding Republican support for the investigation.</p> <p>In early April 2010, Feinstein, frustrated with the lack of access to agency personnel, wrote to Panetta requesting interviews. It was a preliminary step: at that point, she sought little more than Panetta\u2019s assurance to begin processing interviews on the committee\u2019s behalf. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2de5bcc88d7f713c2139b633847a00fd7169d78c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2de5bcc88d7f713c2139b633847a00fd7169d78c/0_208_4416_2649/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Dianne Feinstein\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Bond rejected Feinstein\u2019s request \u2013 not only in a letter to her two weeks later, but in a letter to Panetta a few days after that, urging him not to make CIA officials available to the committee. His stated rationale was the same: steering agency employees out of criminal danger. But as Bond also objected to document requests of the sort Panetta had already agreed to provide, Jones suspected other motives.</p> <p>Jones had lost the support of the committee Republicans. \u201cAt this point, they\u2019re working on behalf of CIA,\u201d he said. Bond did not reply to a request for an interview.</p> <p>Panetta, and his successors, never approved any interviews the committee sought with agency personnel. It wasn\u2019t only officials involved in the program who were constrained in speaking with Jones. In October 2009, during a visit to Langley, Jones sought to interview staff from the inspector general\u2019s office, which had investigated interrogations in 2004. Stephen Preston, the CIA\u2019s lead attorney, stood in the hallway outside his office and insisted he be able to attend the meeting, explicitly to monitor what they discussed on behalf of Panetta. Voices were raised, and Jones\u2019s team marched out of Langley rather than hold the meeting on those terms. Preston \u2013 who declined comment to the Guardian \u2013 finally relented, and an unmonitored meeting occurred the following month. </p> <p>\u201cWhen Director Panetta agreed to provide [the committee] with unprecedented access to CIA documents to pursue its review, the Office of General Counsel was established as the sole conduit for requests and responses to the committee,\u201d said CIA spokesman Ryan Trapani.</p> <p>\u201cThere was a meeting with [committee] staff and OIG where the General Counsel participated in that role. It is our understanding that when topics moved to issues unrelated to the review, the General Counsel left and the meeting between [committee] staff and the OIG proceeded.\u201d</p> <p>Jones\u2019s fight with the CIA was just beginning. </p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>It turned out that those contractors the committee thought the CIA hired to aid in collecting responsive documents were also acting as gatekeepers. They would review torture documents three times before disseminating them to the investigators to determine not only relevance, but whether higher-ups ought to make the call to turn them over. In some cases, the chain went up to the White House, to review for executive privilege \u2013 advisory conversations with White House staff, a broad category that typically keeps a record within the hands of an administration.</p> <p>White House counsel Greg Craig, his successor Bob Bauer, and Don Verilli were involved in the review, with their colleague Kate Shaw trekking to the off-site location. The attorneys would describe the documents flagged for them to Jones and Starzak, case by case, and ask if they were interested in them. In several cases, the volume of documents meant the CIA had already unwittingly turned over copies of documents flagged for executive privilege review \u2013 and, once informed of that, the White House attorneys would roll their eyes and move on.</p> <p>The White House involvement helped Feinstein navigate the first outright crisis in CIA-committee relations over the torture inquiry. In March 2010 Jones and his colleagues started noticing that they had difficulty accessing documents they knew they already had. Simple search terms weren\u2019t retrieving certain records anymore. </p> <p>\u201cWe noticed they were gone right away,\u201d Jones said. </p> <p>It would have been easy to disappear documents, even in substantial amounts. The agency had provided millions of pages. The only way it could have happened was for the agency to have removed the information from a computer network the CIA set up for the Senate that Jones did not know the agency could access. </p> <p>Confronted, the CIA pointed to the tech consultants. Then they pointed the finger at the White House, suggesting that Obama\u2019s attorneys ordered them to remove the documents \u2013 a much bigger accusation, with serious implications. Feinstein, alarmed, turned to the White House, and on 12 March, Jones met with White House lawyers, who denied ordering the removal of anything. </p> <p>In a process that remains opaque to Jones, the CIA investigated internally and, months later, determined they had removed <a href=\"https://www.cia.gov/library/reports/Redacted-December-2014-Agency-Accountability-Board-Report.pdf\">over 900 documents</a> from the committee. It happened twice \u2013 with another, smaller wave of removals occurring in May, months after Feinstein first brought the issue to the White House. And it was a violation of the agreements the agency had reached with the committee about the conduct of the inquiry.<br></p> <p>\u201cThis really upset us early on, because it would never have happened if we had conducted this investigation like we conducted every other CIA and intelligence community investigation, which is that it happens at our location, on our computers,\u201d Jones said. </p> <p>Ultimately, new White House counsel Bauer conveyed verbally to the chairwoman that the CIA would not remove any more documents. On 17 May, the CIA apologized to Feinstein as well. The committee never got the removed documents back, but at least had alternate copies of some .</p> <p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t like, we thought, they would enter into our computers and search them, or go through them,\u201d Jones said, with a wry laugh.</p> <p>Around then, the CIA\u2019s contractor staff largely turned over. The new crew were \u201cmore cordial, open, informal\u201d, Jones remembered. (\u201cThose working relationships were professional and I am unaware of any need for bolstering,\u201d the CIA\u2019s Trapani said.) They dragged their feet on document requests less. Some would even complain, in shared frustration with Jones\u2019s team, that their superiors were taking too long to release material. </p> <p>Jones attempted to accommodate his CIA counterparts. Agency officials would occasionally come to him, expressing concern that some documents they provided were marginally related to interrogations, but they contained information about ongoing and unrelated operations. Some of them contained material that was especially sensitive, particularly for contemporary agency activities, but didn\u2019t shed significant light on torture. He let them \u201cpull the documents \u2026 This happened throughout, even up until the very end.\u201d</p> <p>The agency made other changes that eased the committee\u2019s task. Later in 2010, CIA got rid of the clunky old search tool, following longstanding complaints from both Jones and Durham\u2019s investigators, and replaced the network search function with a Google interface. Easier sifting was \u201chugely important\u201d, Jones said, as the agency kept piling material on. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>This would never have happened if we had conducted this investigation \u2026 at our location, our computers</p> <footer> <cite>Daniel Jones</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The year 2010 gave way to 2011 and 2012. Panetta left to run the Pentagon and David Petraeus, the retired general, took his place. Petraeus seemed \u201csupportive\u201d of the inquiry, recalled Jones. Yet as the committee staff worked nights and weekends at the satellite CIA office, some wondered if the deluge of documentation was a tactic to ensure the investigation collapsed under the weight of accumulated material. </p> <p>Even with the glut of documentation, the Senate team did not have sufficient evidence to give an account of a major aspect of the CIA\u2019s post-9/11 apparatus: rendition. </p> <p>Renditions, used before 9/11, were extrajudicial transfers of captured people; after 9/11, a variant, called \u201cextraordinary rendition\u201d, sent captives to the custody of allied intelligence services, neither American nor the country of a detainee\u2019s origin. Some of the CIA\u2019s closest rendition partners worked for the world\u2019s most brutal dictators: Syria\u2019s Bashar al-Assad, Libya\u2019s Muammar Gaddafi, Pakistan\u2019s Pervez Musharraf, Egypt\u2019s Hosni Mubarak. <br></p> <p>The rendition infrastructure was even bigger than that of the black sites, which the CIA itself ran. More detainees ran through it than the at least 119 held at the black sites. But once detainees moved into a different intelligence service\u2019s custody, the records the CIA retained of them were scant, or secondhand, or both. It posed a problem for an investigation that sought rigorous internal documentation for every claim it would make. The more time the Senate spent attempting to run down rendition leads, the more it would delay its investigation of the CIA\u2019s interrogations and detentions. And after all, the mandate for the inquiry set by the committee was to determine what the CIA did to men it detained, not what its partners did. <br></p> <p>\u201cIt was a killer not to cover it, but you\u2019ve got to draw a line,\u201d Jones said. Much CIA documentation the committee had referring to rendition amounted to \u201chearsay\u201d, not enough to responsibly present.<br></p> <p>\u201cThose rendition records don\u2019t involve people who were technically detained by the CIA. These are transients. The records are just not there.\u201d </p> <p>But the consequence of that decision was profound. While ultimately the classified version of Jones\u2019s report would contain information on CIA renditions, the vast majority of the CIA\u2019s renditions operations \u2013 operations that left still-untold numbers of people disappeared, severely wounded, and likely worse \u2013 have been lost to history. </p> <p>Among legislators, the inquiry became background noise. Bond had relinquished the vice-chairmanship to Saxby Chambliss of Georgia, who in 2009 had been the only dissenting vote against launching the investigation. Feinstein, on five different occasions, asked the GOP to rejoin the inquiry, to no avail. </p> <p>It took until August 2012 for the CIA to cease the bulk document production. (The CIA disputes this, and Trapani said it continued to \u201cfacilitate and support\u201d Senate document access until December 2014.) By then, the staff estimated they had the equivalent of two urban libraries. Jones had been writing the classified report incrementally. Starting in October 2011, Feinstein had him send pieces of the report to the committee, Democrats and Republicans, so no one was taken by surprise. </p> <p>In December 2012, Jones finished the report. It was at that point 6,200 pages long and entirely secret. In a sign of the diminished partisan consensus around torture, the vote to adopt the report was 9-6, with Maine moderate<strong> </strong>Olympia Snowe the only Republican to assent. Now would come the next fight: to declassify the report. </p> <p>But since the committee had a more immediate task, Feinstein and the Democrats decided to leverage it. On 7 February 2013, Obama confidant John Brennan had his confirmation hearing with the panel to run his beloved CIA. By now, the CIA had overcome its major fear over torture accountability: Durham\u2019s investigation had concluded in summer 2012 and had prosecuted no one. There would be no criminal accountability for torture, and it was an open question whether the public would ever read Jones\u2019s report. The committee sought Brennan\u2019s attitude toward the inquiry.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2edb1b0d04a3d852bd679fdb2e6cc2e7219a15e4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2edb1b0d04a3d852bd679fdb2e6cc2e7219a15e4/0_100_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"John Brennan\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Brennan is sworn in to testify at his confirmation hearing on 7 February 2013.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jason Reed/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Brennan equivocated on torture throughout the hearing. Although he was the agency\u2019s deputy executive director when the program began, he minimized his knowledge of it. (A former CIA officer who has long known Brennan and who has since criticized torture, Glenn Carle, told the Guardian: \u201cHe has never been a proponent of this stuff.\u201d) Brennan called waterboarding \u201creprehensible\u201d but would not, under repeated questioning, call it torture. He promised outright to provide the committee with his \u201cfull and honest views\u201d after reading the torture report, but when pressed on declassifying it, said: \u201cI would have to take that declassification request under serious consideration, obviously.\u201d</p> <p>No response was forthcoming to the declassification request. But on 27 June 2013, the CIA sent a 100-plus page response to the committee raising a host of objections to the Senate\u2019s conclusions. </p> <p>The agency dissented from the conclusion that torture \u201cdid not produce unique intelligence that led terrorist plots to be disrupted, terrorists to be captured, or lives to be saved.\u201d That \u201cflawed conclusion\u201d led to another, the agency claimed: that the CIA \u201cresisted internal and external oversight and deliberately misrepresented to Congress, the executive branch, the media, and the American people\u201d the truth about its torture. </p> <p>Rejecting an assessment that the agency \u201cmisrepresented\u201d the program \u2013 lied about torture, less euphemistically \u2013 the agency said: \u201cThe factual record maintained by the agency does not support such conclusions.\u201d </p> <p>Jones was stunned, and for a very particular reason. For years, he had been in possession of a specific agency document that not only supported those conclusions, it reached them itself \u2013 what a senator on the committee, Mark Udall of Colorado, would later call a \u201csmoking gun\u201d.</p> <p>The document was the Panetta Review. Much of it remains a mystery to Jones even today: whether he or another staffer found it on the network, whether the agency meant them to receive it, or if an agency whistleblower slipped it onto the Senate drive. Nor does the CIA have an answer to the puzzle: \u201cCIA does not know how [Senate] staff acquired the unauthorized documents,\u201d Trapani said. But Jones recalls discovering it around 2010 and \u201cpretty immediately\u201d understanding its significance. </p> <p>\u201cWhen we saw this document, we weren\u2019t like, \u2018Oh, great, we got the CIA.\u2019 It was: \u2018Oh, Jesus Christ, thank God \u2013 we\u2019re not crazy,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cThis was high stakes. A lot was riding on it. It was a relief.\u201d </p> <p>They called it the Panetta Review because the agency prepared a summary of its renditions, detentions and interrogations work for Director Panetta, who had come to Langley after Obama shut the program down. One version was a Microsoft Word document, clearly a draft, with the function allowing users to see each others\u2019 changes enabled. Another version, apparently more final, was a PDF. Iterations by CIA were clear on view: \u201cYou could see the attorneys looking at it and saying, \u2018Well, let\u2019s make sure we can back this up, can you add more citations?\u2019\u201d</p> <p>The final version of the Panetta Review, Jones said, was more than 1,000 pages long. The CIA has represented it as \u201csummaries of documents being provided to the [committee] \u2026 highlighting the most noteworthy information contained in the millions of pages of documents being made available,\u201d as agency attorney Martha Lutz would tell a court after Vice reporter Jason Leopold sought to acquire the still-classified document. Jones said that description is incorrect.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a narrative, plain and simple. \u2018This is Abu Zubaydah\u2019s interrogation.\u2019 \u2018This is KSM [Khalid Shaikh Mohammed].\u2019 They\u2019re topic oriented: \u2018These are the inaccurate things we told the president.\u2019 It\u2019s a final findings document. It has 13 findings. And one is, basically, they provided inaccurate information to support the use of EITs,\u201d or enhanced interrogation techniques, the agency\u2019s preferred euphemism for torture.<br></p> <p>Lutz would later tell a federal court that \u201ceven the post polished versions remained drafts and were subject to change\u201d. The CIA stopped compiling the Panetta Review in 2010 after Durham told Preston that CIA risked complicating any prosecution if it \u201cmade different judgments than the prosecutors had reached\u201d, Charlie Savage reported in his 2015 book Power Wars.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>What\u2019s so shocking about that is that we thought this problem \u2026 was limited to the Bush administration</p> <footer> <cite>Dan Jones</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Useful as the document was, it took on brand new significance now that the CIA was denying the conclusions that it had endorsed in the Panetta Review. </p> <p>\u201cI did not think they were going to say: \u2018None of this is right, you\u2019re all wrong.\u2019 I expected to receive the Panetta Review,\u201d Jones said.</p> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s so shocking about that is that we thought this problem \u2013 the CIA providing inaccurate information to the president \u2013 was limited to the Bush administration, to [ex-directors] Tenet, Goss and Hayden.

In 2013, the brand opened its first physical store in the hipster Mile End area of Montr\u00e9al \u2013 but this wasn\u2019t a shop in the traditional sense. \u201cIn the age of the internet, when anyone can buy anything, the purpose of a store has changed,\u201d says Song.<br></p> <p>\u201cThe Frank + Oak coffee shop opened as a place for our community to assemble. It\u2019s designed to reflect the unique experience of its location. Having floor space to sell products isn\u2019t the main objective, and we employed an engagement person to get involved in the community and make contact with local heroes to feature in our magazine,\u201d he says. \u201cIt helps to create a deeper link between customers and the brand.\u201d<br></p> <p>Song says he wanted Frank + Oak to bring people together around spaces and interests, rather than trends, creating culture and community, and this vision pervades all levels of the company: pop into Frank + Oak\u2019s workshop at its Mile End headquarters and you\u2019ll find a stylish bike mounted on a wall. \u201cIt\u2019s from a collaboration we did with local Montr\u00e9al company V\u00e9lo iBike,\u201d co-founder Ratnani told youinc. \u201cIt sits on the wall in the studio, and represents the modern man: simple, sophisticated, and always on the move.\u201d<br></p> <p>After Montr\u00e9al, Frank + Oak opened a store in Toronto. \u201cWe now have 13 Frank + Oak stores across North America, all with the same local ethos as our original Mile End coffee shop,\u201d says Song.<br></p> <p>In addition to the shop, plans are afoot to move into beauty and launch women\u2019s products. Song\u2019s ambition may be to \u201cgo more global\u201d, but he still draws inspiration from the creative, up-and-coming neighbourhood the company calls home: \u201cThere has been a real transformation in Mile End. It used to be full of textile companies, but now it\u2019s all startups, highlighting the change from manufacturing to digital. People live, work and socialise in this neighbourhood and the food scene is growing fast. People want that overall package: that\u2019s what we offer at Frank + Oak, so Mile End is the ideal place for our base.\u201d<br></p> <p><strong>Things to do in Montr\u00e9al, as recommended by Ethan Song:</strong></p> <ul> <li>Walk the length of Saint Laurent Boulevard, from the river to Little Italy, for a taste of the whole city.</li> <li>Sample the vibrant foodie scene at <a href=\"http://noragray.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Nora Gray</a>, serving southern Italian cuisine, and <a href=\"http://joebeef.ca/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Joe Beef</a>, with traditional Montr\u00e9al dishes. </li> <li>Hang out at <a href=\"http://atwatercocktailclub.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Atwater Cocktail Club</a>, a trendy back alley bar, and <a href=\"http://cafeolimpico.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Caf\u00e9 Olimpico</a>, with a 40-year history and European vibe.</li> <li>Check out the work of emerging local artists at <a href=\"http://parisianlaundry.com/fr\" rel=\"nofollow\">Parisian Laundry</a>, a gallery in a restored industrial building.</li> <li>Immerse yourself in French language theatre at <a href=\"http://tnm.qc.ca/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Th\u00e9\u00e2tre du Nouveau Monde</a>, which stages traditional and modern classics, including the work of writer and director, Robert Lepage.</li> </ul> <p><em>For more information and inspiration, see </em><em><a href=\"https://uk-keepexploring.canada.travel/?utm_source=guardian&amp;utm_medium=native_advertising&amp;utm_campaign=uk_fall_2017_p&amp;utm_content=pd_advertising_bottom+link\" rel=\"nofollow\">explore-canada.co.uk</a></em></p>",

She recently dismissed an attorney (savings: $38,400 a year), reduced her secretary to part-time ($7,194 a year), canceled the office\u2019s cellphone plan ($1,829.28) and discontinued housekeeping services ($2,400).

She can usually be found with a giant Sonic cup of Diet Coke in the crook of one arm (\u201cI\u2019m addicted,\u201d she says) and a handful of files in the other. </p> <p>Her intern, Jimmy Zahorchak, is helping out for now; by August, he will have gone back to law school at Louisiana State University. \u201cOne summer of help, that\u2019s all I get,\u201d she says. \u201cI can only pay him $10 an hour anyhow, so I\u2019ll probably lose him to the DA\u2019s office.\u201d</p> <p>Zahorchak is making copies of motions for her to sign while the phone is ringing off the hook. </p> <p>\u201cPublic defender\u2019s office,\u201d Covington answers. \u201cHey dear, how are you?

Then she is headed to the jail back in East Feliciana Parish to visit a new client named Mario Adams, who she thinks might be locked up on the wrong burglary warrant. \u201cIt just doesn\u2019t feel right,\u201d she says, pointing out that Adams is from Mississippi and that the police have no evidence he was even in East Feliciana at the time of the burglary. \u201cI have to check it out.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"e2e3093d58dcdb15c3e03e9591694d5acbbed5c8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e2e3093d58dcdb15c3e03e9591694d5acbbed5c8/0_0_1905_1143/1000.jpg\" alt=\"stack of paperwork\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Covington\u2019s district received only $34,086 in assistance from the state last year to run a public defender\u2019s office that covers more than 900 cases across two parishes.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Laurence Mathieu-Leger/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Finally, a few minutes into that drive, while passing an inmate work crew on the left, Covington has a moment to lament how rushed she felt back in the courtroom. \u201cThe clients insist on your full, undivided attention,\u201d she says. \u201cBut without any money, without any help, you just can\u2019t do it \u2026 I shouldn\u2019t complain.

It shouldn\u2019t be cheap to take away someone\u2019s liberty.\u201d</p> <p>The district attorney\u2019s office in Covington\u2019s district, after all, handles a similar caseload but with about $1m more in its budget. She used to be able to afford a translator, but now, whenever she has a Spanish-speaking client, she has to rely on a police officer to translate their private discussions \u2013 which, she says, is a conflict for obvious reasons. She also had a case a few years ago in which a handwriting expert saved her client from going to jail, but she definitely would not be able to afford that now.</p> <p>When Covington gets to the jail, she is greeted by a chorus of \u201cHeya there, Ms Rhonda!\u201d She walks past a long, white board with the names of almost a hundred inmates scribbled on it.

Here in the 16th judicial district, at the St Martinville courthouse, it is \u201cfelony plea day\u201d, with Judge Gregory Aucoin presiding.</p> <p>Many of these defendants have not discussed their cases with their public defender yet, and they will have about 30 seconds to speak with him this morning.</p> <p>Then the judge, with a cigar dangling from his mouth, will ask: \u201cAre you satisfied with the advice your attorney has given you in this matter?\u201d </p> <p>\u201cYes, sir.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes, sir.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes, sir,\u201d they will all say, down the row.</p> <p>\u201cOK, I accept your plea agreement.\u201d</p> <p>And just like that, with no time for arguments to be heard in each of their cases, they will have all pleaded guilty together, and will be headed to prison for years, sometimes decades.</p> <p>Last year, the 16th district\u2019s public defender\u2019s office was forced to cut $311,000 from an already skeletal budget of about $1.5m. As a result, they offered increasingly cursory assistance at these mass hearings, in which up to 50 defendants are collectively marched into a courtroom then convicted and sentenced to major felony charges carrying up to life in prison.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--showcase\"> <blockquote> <p>They\u2019re trying to put people in prison \u2026 A fair trial is considered an interruption</p> <footer> <cite>Christopher Murell, New Orleans attorney</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cMass pleas\u201d of this sort are not unheard of in Louisiana and elsewhere in the country, especially in states with chronic public defender problems, including <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/05/30/pennsylvania-public-defenders_n_1556192.html\">Pennsylvania</a>, <a href=\"http://www.sltrib.com/home/3639321-155/utah-lawmakers-pass-a-bill-to\">Utah</a>, <a href=\"http://www.freep.com/story/opinion/columnists/stephen-henderson/2016/08/14/michigan-public-defender-davontae-sanford/88464698/\">Michigan</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/08/when-the-governor-is-your-lawyer/494453/\">Missouri</a>. Usually, however, it is a process reserved for much smaller groups of defendants, especially in misdemeanor cases, while major felonies involving the possibility of significant prison time receive more individualized attention.</p> <p>As the hearing in St Martinville begins, the only defender in the courtroom, Gary LeGros, glances at the long list of people he is representing. Wearing a small hoop earring and a suit that hangs over his hands, he calls out to the defendants in the pews, who, unlike those in the plea box, were able to pay bail and came to court freely: \u201cEveryone here who\u2019s represented by the public defender\u2019s office, please come up and print your name on this sheet!\u201d</p> <p>LeGros holds up a legal pad, and over a dozen people stream forward. He then gives their names to an assistant, who rummages through several mammoth file boxes, looking for each case.</p> <p>One of the defendants, Brandon Washington, is facing burglary charges. He says he used to have a paid attorney but lost his job at a Halliburton factory and had to turn to the public defender. Several months after making that switch, he has no idea who his lawyer is and has never talked to him.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/08/louisiana-public-defender-crisis\">Louisiana public defenders: a lawyer with a pulse will do</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cI think it may be that guy,\u201d he says, referring to LeGros.</p> <p>LeGros soon makes his way into the jury box with the men in jumpsuits and chains. He asks for their names, calling back to his assistant to see if she has the relevant file. Then he gives each the option of making a deal, and if they say yes, he shouts over to the DA.</p> <p>\u201cThat one\u2019s a theft case, we\u2019ll do a deal,\u201d shouts the DA.</p> <p>\u201cOK,\u201d says LeGros, after checking quickly with the defendant.</p> <p>\u201cMr LeGros, what\u2019s that one pleading?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGuilty, I think.\u201d</p> <p>As more deals are made across the room, there is little discussion of the nature of each case, or of the background and circumstances of each defendant. Every agreement is made in a matter of seconds, weighed and considered by each defendant for only a moment. Ultimately, no defendants will plead \u201cnot guilty\u201d today and go to trial. </p> <p>In fact, of the 4,492 felony cases in this district last year, there were only eight jury trials, and not because only eight people believed they were not guilty. The court schedule sets aside one week for trials every three months, and anyone who wants a trial has to wait, usually in jail, for one of those dates to come around. The public defenders, with no time to be more thorough, advise their clients that pleading is the surest, safest way to go.</p> <p>When everyone has been prepped for their \u201cmass plea\u201d, a bank of white lawyers \u2013 defenders and prosecutors seated close together \u2013 face the panel of black defendants. The judge, Aucoin, starts reading off their pleas. He informs them of their rights, and in an instant, all are felons.</p> <p>LeGros turns to the defendants\u2019 families, who have been watching from the front rows, and says: \u201cWelcome to the criminal justice system.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"45e76ddb1dcf1d5d606d84e6be4a703ef405ab5f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/45e76ddb1dcf1d5d606d84e6be4a703ef405ab5f/147_0_1858_1115/1000.jpg\" alt=\"iberia parish courthouse\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">There were only eight jury trials in the 16th judicial district last year.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Laurence Mathieu-L\u00e9ger/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>If he had more funding, LeGros would spend more time doing \u201creal lawyer work\u201d, as he puts it, instead of just processing his clients en masse. \u201cI can pretty much keep track of all of them, and most cases don\u2019t require much attention,\u201d he says by phone. \u201cBut there\u2019s no way all those boys understand what\u2019s going on when they get their rights all together like that. I don\u2019t like it, but shit, I\u2019m just a country lawyer. What you going to do?\u201d</p> <p>Yet the group pleas are only partly the result of an underfunded public defender\u2019s office, says Christopher Murell, a civil rights attorney in New Orleans and the executive director of the Promise of Justice Initiative, a criminal justice reform organization. It is also about a courtroom culture \u2013 on the part of judges, DAs and public defenders alike \u2013 of trying to get all the cases processed expediently, without friction.</p> <p>The judges and DAs \u201cget angry at you for not giving them a heads up that you\u2019re going to file a motion, because that will mess up their schedule\u201d, says Murell. \u201cA fair trial is considered an interruption.\u201d</p> <p>Cecelia \u201cBeanie\u201d Bonin, is the chief public defender of the district (and Le Gros\u2019s boss). Her office is located adjacent to an above-ground cemetery, in a first-floor space that feels more like a basement. On a whiteboard at the back of one room, someone has listed a set of priorities:</p> <p>#1: How to go about getting the waitlist moving.</p> <p>#2: Review who needs an attorney.</p> <p>And further down the list, in all caps, #10: PROCEDURE FOR SANITY.</p> <p>When she took over the office in March 2015, Bonin thought she would begin by raising expectations. Her plan was to get control over the caseload, promote performance standards, and demand that her attorneys file more motions and have more meaningful conversations with their clients. She never considered that more than a year later, her attorneys would be watching helplessly during mass hearings like the one in St Martinville.</p> <p>But Bonin soon realized that when an office is perpetually on the brink of bankruptcy, little else is possible. She could not afford enough attorneys to actually discuss pleas in advance, let alone develop relationships with defendants. Nor could she find good, experienced lawyers who would work for her in the first place, given how little she was able to pay them. The ones she already employed all needed to work two jobs to supplement their salaries, which begin at $34,000 a year.</p> <p>One of Bonin\u2019s lawyers had 345 active cases but was working only 15 hours a week. The rest of the time, she ran a private practice.</p> <h2>\u2018Commit the same crime next time\u2019</h2> <p>In the 16th judicial district and across Louisiana, things have improved slightly for public defenders since July, when the state legislature\u2019s new budget went into effect. Controversially, it <a href=\"http://www.nola.com/politics/index.ssf/2016/04/lawmakers_look_to_give_more_mo.html\">slashed funding</a> for the lawyers who represent defendants in death penalty cases, and shifted that money to the overwhelmed district-level defenders. Now, defendants facing the death penalty are finding themselves on waitlists for legal counsel. </p> <p>Even with the shift in the budget, Rhonda Covington still labors alone, and the mass pleas have continued. One summer day in New Iberia, just down the road from St Martinville, Judge Thibodeaux turns toward a plea box of a dozen poor defendants. Smiling, he says to them: \u201cY\u2019all just need to all commit the same crime next time, so we can do this faster.\u201d</p> <p>A public defender goes over to them, learns their names, and makes a deal.</p> <p>Then the judge starts in, mass-processing them by reading off their rights.</p> <p>\u201cDo you understand your right to a jury trial?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes, sir.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes, sir.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes, sir,\u201d they all answer.</p> <p>\u201cDo you understand your right to confront your accusers?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes, sir.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes, sir.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI can\u2019t hear you. Say, \u2018Yes, sir,\u2019\u201d the judge says to one defendant.</p> <p>\u201cDo you understand that you have the right to counsel when the state proceeds against you?\u201d</p> <p>The public defender is not paying attention. He is talking to the next batch of defendants, scribbling down their pleas.</p>",
  "<p>If I said I wanted to die, the press, celebrities and the public would support my choice, seeing it as rational and understandable.

But MPs who glanced out the window would have seen more Not Dead Yet (NDY) T-shirts and banners than religious ones. NDY is made up of disabled people opposed to a change in the law. Every major disabled group in the UK, it should be stressed, is opposed to this legislation.</p> <p>Suicide is, of course, an individual choice. Disabled people who are determined to take their lives may even find it easier to do so than abled people, given the often precarious nature of their existences. But that does not mean that when a fellow human being \u2013 disabled or abled \u2013 expresses the wish to die because their life is shit, that we should agree with them. The value of a life is not just in its physicality but in our relationships with those around us.</p> <p>The bill, had it passed, would have licensed doctors to assist in the deaths of terminally-ill people who had less than six months to live, were mentally competent and requested such assistance. But the direction legislation has taken in other countries shows that the sympathy we disabled people evoke can be used to justify support for us to kill ourselves while non-disabled people are told they have \u201ceverything to live for\u201d. How many times has someone come up to me and said how much they admired me just for existing because they could not, in my condition?</p> <p>There is a fine line between those who are terminally ill and those who are disabled in public perception and the emotional power behind the campaign for assisted suicide is based on misplaced pity.

  "<p>The protest overwhelming the start of the NFL season began not with a shout or raised fist but an act so passive it was all but invisible to the thousands who were there. On the night of 26 August, San Francisco 49ers quarterback <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/27/colin-kaepernick-national-anthem-protest\">Colin Kaepernick refused to stand for the national anthem</a> before the team\u2019s pre-season game against the Green Bay Packers. His defiance was nearly impossible to discern as he sat surrounded by Gatorade containers on the team\u2019s bench. It might have been missed altogether had a reporter from the NFL Network not noticed and asked him about it after the game.</p> <p>\u201cI am not going to stand up to show pride in a flag for a country that oppresses black people and people of color,\u201d Kaepernick <a href=\"http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap3000000691077/article/colin-kaepernick-explains-why-he-sat-during-national-anthem\">told the NFL Network that night.</a> \u201cTo me, this is bigger than football and it would be selfish on my part to look the other way. There are bodies in the street and people getting paid leave and getting away with murder.\u201d</p> <p>A firestorm ensued, igniting a national debate about racial inequality, police brutality and the meaning of the American flag. Kaepernick, a fading football star who had never seemed political, instantly became a nationally polarizing figure, much as Muhammad Ali had been when he refused to fight in the Vietnam war. </p> <p>While some fans torched Kaepernick\u2019s jersey, thousands more flocked to buy it \u2013 his shirt is currently the <a href=\"http://www.nflshop.com/Jerseys/pg/1/ps/96/so/top_sellers\">top seller</a> on the NFL\u2019s website. As many labeled him a traitor, others have rushed to his side. This week, Georgetown University sociology professor Michael Eric Dyson, an African American historian, <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://theundefeated.com/features/the-courage-of-colin-kaepernick/\">called his protest</a> \u201ca thoughtful reflection on how best to highlight the plague of injustice, and the need, finally, to hold our nation accountable for black death in the streets\u201d. Three players, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/sep/01/colin-kaepernick-eric-reid-kneel-national-anthem-protest-san-francisco-49ers\">49ers team-mate Eric Reid</a>, Denver Bronco Brandon Marshall and Seattle Seahawk Jeremy Lane, have joined Kaeperkick in refusing to stand for the anthem, along with <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/04/megan-rapinoe-anthem-protest-colin-kaepernick\">women\u2019s soccer player Megan Rapinoe</a>.</p> <p>In many ways, Kaepernick has chosen the perfect forum for drawing attention to America\u2019s problems with racial inequality. No major American professional league drapes itself in overwrought patriotism more than the NFL, and no other league \u2013 the NBA aside \u2013 is as dominated by African American athletes.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2016/sep/08/olin-kaepernick-roger-goodell-national-anthem-protest-military-racial-oppression\">Goodell missed the point: Kaepernick's argument isn't with the military</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The national anthem is a big event before games, with honor guards and salutes to soldiers. Giant American flags often cover the entire field and military jets buzz the stadium, timing their pass to match the anthem\u2019s final words. In some cities, players clutch American flags as they lead their team-mates to the field. Even in supporting Kaepernick\u2019s right to protest, the other day NFL commissioner Roger Goodell was quick to add: \u201cWe believe very strongly in patriotism in the NFL.\u201d </p> <p>Charged rhetoric has been spilling from the presidential campaign, and the flag is becoming a hammer that some white people have used against African Americans in the US. At last month\u2019s Olympics, black gymnast <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/15/gabby-douglas-hounding-american-champion-olympics\">Gabby Douglas was besieged with criticism</a> for not putting her hand on her heart as the anthem played during a gold medal ceremony. But while Douglas was standing at attention to the flag, unaware that her action could be perceived as a slight, Kaepernick is intentionally sitting to challenge the kind of racism that unfairly judged Douglas.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9c0b3ef683743b6033999c6ef08244e7c6f20c9a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9c0b3ef683743b6033999c6ef08244e7c6f20c9a/0_447_2786_1672/1000.jpg\" alt=\"At last month\u2019s Olympics, black gymnast Gabby Douglas was besieged with criticism for not putting her hand on her heart as the anthem played during a gold medal ceremony.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Gymnast Gabby Douglas was besieged with criticism for not putting her hand on her heart as the anthem played during a gold medal ceremony.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mike Blake/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Kaepernick\u2019s actions have not come in a vacuum. The past two years in the US have seen a surge in protests highlighting racial inequality since the shooting of a black teenager, Michael Brown, by a white police officer in Ferguson, Missouri. The protests, most notably by the Black Lives Matter movement, have helped push the conversation about race into the national consciousness. </p> <p>\u201cThis is something that has to be said, it has to be brought to the forefront of everybody\u2019s attention, and when that\u2019s done I think people can realize what the situation [is] and then really effect change,\u201d Kaepernick said.</p> <p>Kaepernick was born to a white mother and black father in Milwaukee, and was later adopted by a white family who raised him in suburban Wisconsin and California.</p> <p>He is no longer the prominent player he was when he shot to stardom in 2012. Back then, he led the 49ers to within five yards of winning Super Bowl XLVII, but his play quickly tumbled as teams adjusted to his running and passing style. Last season he lost the starting quarterback job, further distancing him from team-mates to whom he had never seemed very close.</p> <p>He has, however, found a voice as an activist. In the past few months, he has grown out his hair, filled his Twitter feed with poignant comments on social issues, and wears a Malcolm X baseball cap. He is smiling more than he ever did in the past. When he addressed the media a few days after the Green Bay game, he didn\u2019t mumble a few words as he used to in press conferences but instead spoke thoughtfully for 20 minutes. He said he wanted to start a conversation about race. He said he had already done so with his team-mates and wanted people to do the same nationally.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m going to continue to stand with the people that are being oppressed,\u201d Kaepernick said at the time. \u201cTo me this is something that has to change. When there\u2019s significant change and I feel like that flag represents what it\u2019s supposed to represent: this country is representing people the way it\u2019s supposed to, I\u2019ll stand.\u201d<br></p> <p> In the ensuing days people have tried to determine Kaepernick\u2019s motives. As many players, like the New York Giants\u2019 Justin Pugh, criticize his stand as a slap against the military, some push the story that he has been influenced by his girlfriend Nessa Djab, a radio host who is Muslim, alleging that he too is converting \u2013 a rumor he squashed this week. \u201cI think that comes along with people\u2019s fear of this protest, as well as Islamophobia in this country,\u201d he said before taking a swipe at Donald Trump. \u201cPeople are terrified of them to the point where Trump wants to ban all Muslims from coming here, which is ridiculous.\u201d</p> <p>Now that Kaepernick has gotten the nation\u2019s attention, the next question is how effective will his protest be? \u201cI think that we are talking about (the anthem) but we aren\u2019t talking about the core issue he is raising. he\u2019s raising issues about racism and history,\u201d says Katheryn Russell-Brown, a law professor at the University of Florida. \u201cWe aren\u2019t comfortable talking about these things across racial lines. People are talking about them but they are doing so with people of their own race.\u201d</p> <p>Unlike Ali, who was ostracized from boxing for what would have been his prime years, Kaepernick will be allowed to continue his protest. Neither the 49ers nor the league will punish him. They probably understand that his is not a solitary voice, something Kaepernick alluded to this week when he said other players wanted to join him but are \u201cnervous about the consequences\u201d. The Seahawks, for instance, have discussed <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/sep/08/seattle-seahawks-team-national-anthem-protest-colin-kaepernick-sunday-opener\">joining Kaepernick and their team-mate Lane</a> in sitting for the anthem this weekend. <span tabindex=\"-1\">If they do, their act will be obvious to everyone watching, unlike the initial, silent protest that has started a movement. </span></p>",
  "<p>In February 1997, a regular visitor to the popular online discussion forum Usenet had reached his limit.

JonBen\u00e9t\u2019s wealthy parents insisted that they\u2019d woken up the day after Christmas to find a ransom note left by kidnappers on their kitchen staircase. \u201cYou will withdraw $118,000 from your account,\u201d it instructed. Her father, John, apparently made arrangements to pay the ransom and called the police, but soon after authorities arrived, his daughter\u2019s body was found in the wine cellar. There was a nylon cord around her neck; her wrists were tied above her head, and her mouth was covered by duct tape. No call to collect the ransom ever came, there was no sign of a break-in or a struggle, and JonBen\u00e9t\u2019s parents swore they had nothing to do with it. </p> <p>It was a puzzle whose pieces never fit together. The eerie videotapes of the blonde beauty-pageant-contestant child, the big, dark-windowed mansion, the parents who insisted they were innocent, the lurid but inconclusive physical evidence, the strange false confession of schoolteacher John Mark Karr: all of it was a recipe for conspiracy theories in every direction. In the 1990s, the tabloids ruled, and they blanketed the country with the most lurid and outlandish headlines about the case they could think of.</p> <h2>Continued intrigue </h2> <p>This year marks the 20th anniversary of JonBen\u00e9t\u2019s death and in the wake of the new popularity of true crime stories, America will get no less than five new examinations of the Ramsey case.

The \u201cWorld Wide Web\u201d, as people quaintly called the internet in 1996, was more or less made up of text. There was no YouTube. There was no Facebook. There was, however, Usenet, a loose and difficult-to-navigate assortment of message boards. And after the JonBen\u00e9t Ramsey case became a national obsession, curious minds gathered online to try and solve the case themselves, much in the same way as Serial or Making a Murderer. They uploaded documents and traded theories \u2013 and contacted authorities with their findings. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"38a1f984fcd3af31edd288ca84173d2aa419e240\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/38a1f984fcd3af31edd288ca84173d2aa419e240/0_71_1461_1824/801.jpg\" alt=\"Several new examinations of the case are forthcoming in a year that marks two decade since her death. \" width=\"801\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Several new examinations of the case are forthcoming in a year that marks two decade since her death. <br></span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It was, in a sense, America\u2019s first crowd-sourced murder mystery. </p> <p>Within a month of the Ramsey case going public, journalists and law enforcement in Boulder were already saying they\u2019d been inundated by emails from across the world, people hundreds of miles away who were sure they knew who killed JonBen\u00e9t. By late 1997, USA Today was reporting that there were more than 2,000 webpages dedicated to solving the Ramsey case.</p> <h2>Digital sleuths </h2> <p>Factions formed quickly. Some unequivocally believed in the Ramseys. Others unequivocally believed the Ramseys were guilty. They pored over physical evidence. They constructed elaborate scenarios that fit just about any theory of the crime. Some were convinced that a servant must have been responsible \u2013 \u201cthe gardener did it.\u201d Others made any number of claims about the Ramseys: their hobbies, their finances, their friends.</p> <p>They argued, especially, about the ransom note. At two-and-a-half pages, it is believed by criminal justice experts to be the longest ever recorded. Whoever wrote it \u2013 the lettering is <a href=\"http://www.thesmokinggun.com/documents/crime/jonbenet-ramsey-case-documents-0\">shaky and awkward</a> \u2013 is believed to have been disguising their handwriting. All of the official handwriting experts who have ever opined in the case have excluded John Ramsey as the author of the note; the majority have never been able to link it to Patsy Ramsey, either. This has not stopped anyone from speculating about that on the internet from an armchair handwriting-analysis perspective.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"274043b914ad5712af0c6fdc2bcb3d32c2da6dea\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/274043b914ad5712af0c6fdc2bcb3d32c2da6dea/0_0_976_469/500.jpg\" alt=\"The ransom note sent in the JonBen\u00e9t Ramsey case.

Even after weeks of poring over old internet postings and webpages, I wasn\u2019t able to locate a single piece of useful evidence that could definitively be said to have originated with internet users. Instead, the internet obsessives caused problems for officials working on the case, and became the the source of some of its more bizarre narratives.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>They constructed elaborate scenarios that fit just about any theory of the crime</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Take the case of Susan Bennett who went by the alias \u201cJameson\u201d online. Bennett speculated so prolifically online on the popular Websleuths forum and on pages she herself set up, that she ended up becoming a figure in the case herself. Despite the fact that Bennett was a housewife living in North Carolina with no legal training whatsoever, her prolific online postings established her as an authority in the case. She was quoted in innumerable newspaper articles in the late 1990s and appeared on television. Bennett was the first online amateur sleuth to be given such a prominent platform. (Attempts to reach Bennett, if she is still alive, were unsuccessful. Her website is <a href=\"http://www.jameson245.com/\">still up</a>, but her email address is defunct and her common name makes her difficult to locate.)</p> <p>Three years after the case opened, Bennett appeared on a CBS 48 hours segment about the case to discredit a so-called handwriting expert\u2019s claim that Patsy Ramsey had written the ransom note. It was a curious choice for the television producers to make, given that Bennett herself had no expertise or evidence to counter the findings. She was a civilian, like anyone else who\u2019d followed the Ramsey story \u2013 but there she was on national television, presenting herself as an authority. The only difference between Bennett and any other person who\u2019d been closely following the case was that she\u2019d shared her opinions online.</p> <h2>A modern phenomenon</h2> <p>Since the era of Sherlock Holmes, private detectives had long been able to influence cases on their own. But the online detective, who had no sort of professional training, or even long practice, is a purely modern phenomenon. The internet changed everything by letting anyone become a self-appointed \u201cexpert\u201d on a case. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0a38b211f67e2ed7cec875cfc8b4f229ba8487eb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0a38b211f67e2ed7cec875cfc8b4f229ba8487eb/0_324_4928_2956/1000.jpg\" alt=\"JonBen\u00e9t\u2019s tombstone.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">JonBen\u00e9t\u2019s grave. There were reportedly more than 2,000 websites dedicated to solving the case.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy Stock Photo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Bennett is just one example. Hundreds of JonBen\u00e9t case obsessives scoured documents, then developed theories based on any name they came across. Even though their speculations were often deeply far-fetched, they had the power to affect people\u2019s lives, so much so that at least one person took the matter to a court.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.thesmokinggun.com/documents/crime/man-sues-over-jonbenet-murder-claim\">One of the Ramseys\u2019 friends</a> brought suit against an anonymous internet commenter who had speculated on his guilt for the murder. Some documents in the case are sealed but the suit appears to have been abandoned after a few filings. (The Ramseys and Wood have been involved in a number of lawsuits against tabloids and other media organizations and typically request that the documents in those proceedings be sealed, too.)</p> <p>The new wave of coverage promises to re-awaken these issues. On Reddit, a <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/JonBenet/\">JonBen\u00e9t subreddit</a> is already starting to catalogue the evidence. Speculation is unfolding at a rapid pace. And should the various documentaries turn up any new evidence, online detectives can be relied on to pursue it. After the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2016/aug/12/making-a-murderer-brendan-dassey-retrial-release\">recent reversal</a> of Making a Murderer subject Brendan Dassey\u2019s conviction, online sleuths feel they have more power \u2013 and more cause \u2013 to intervene against injustice than ever.</p> <p>Patsy Ramsey died of cancer in 2006, but John Ramsey is an active participant in several of the projects coming this fall. The speculation promises to be rampant. But at least Ramsey can be said, at this point, to be used to that.</p>",
  "<p>About 20 years ago, a woman named Rose Wong moved to a small town in the heart of Silicon Valley and purchased her first computer. </p> <p>\u201cI had no idea how to use it. I taught myself,\u201d she recalled this week.</p> <p>She was 82 years old. </p> <p>Mrs Wong, who happens to be my grandmother, is now 102. She still lives in a retirement community in northern California, and she is still learning how to use new forms of technology.</p> <p>It\u2019s hard to find much tech reporting that focuses on the centenarian market. Certainly there is a large industry developing assistive technologies for the ageing baby boomer generation, but you\u2019re unlikely to read a review of the new iPhone 7 that queries how 102-year-old women with hearing aids and arthritic fingers will handle the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/sep/07/apple-iphone-no-headphone-jack-second-generation-watch\">slim new design</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/sep/07/apple-airpods-launch-problems-with-wireless-headphones\">wireless AirPods</a>.<br></p> <p>Amid the breathless coverage of the latest marginal improvement to existing technologies, it\u2019s also hard to keep perspective on what\u2019s actually likely to change the world and what\u2019s just self-indulgent marketing. </p> <p>So I decided to interview my grandmother to get a century\u2019s worth of perspective on the latest innovations.</p> <h2>The stuff she already uses </h2> <p>My grandmother might be the most tech-savvy centenarian in the world (please don\u2019t fact-check me on this). She taught herself to use that first computer by reading a book (she did attend a few classes for seniors but found the teaching ineffectual) and she has continued to adapt to new technologies as they emerge.</p> <p>This wasn\u2019t always the case. During the 1950s and 1960s, when she worked as a math teacher and guidance counselor in Los Angeles, she and my grandfather refused to purchase a television. The radio was good enough for news and entertainment, and though her children \u2013 my father and aunt \u2013 pleaded their case, she told me, \u201cThey needed to study more than television.\u201d</p> <p>But today, her attitude toward technology is quite positive. </p> <p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t have it, you\u2019re so backwards,\u201d she said. </p> <p>She credits the internet with making people more liberal and tolerant. \u201cThey\u2019re expanding their minds,\u201d she said. \u201cTheir horizons are enlarged.\u201d </p> <p>When she was growing up on a potato ranch in Lillooet, Canada (about 150 miles east of Vancouver) in the 1910s and 1920s, letters to her parents\u2019 families in China took a month to deliver by boat. </p> <p>Today, our family is also widely dispersed geographically (she has great-grandchildren living in Boston, Massachusetts and Durban, South Africa), but she keeps in touch by email (like any self-respecting techie, she has a Gmail address) and Skype. </p> <p>She does most of her shopping online, preferring to try clothes on at home rather than in a cramped dressing room.</p> <p>If she misses the 3pm airing of the PBS NewsHour with Gwen Ifill (\u201cI get very annoyed if somebody calls me at that hour,\u201d she said), she watches it online. </p> <p>She also bowed to necessity and purchased a cellphone about 10 years ago, though she almost never uses it. </p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s only for emergencies,\u201d she said of her flip-phone. </p> <h2>The stuff she doesn\u2019t use</h2> <p>A few years ago, my sister bought my grandmother an iPad, in the hopes that its intuitive design would make it easier for her to get online. But the problem with the touch screen is that it requires a steady touch. </p> <p>My grandmother\u2019s hands show her age in a way that her face does not. It is difficult for her to straighten her fingers enough to place her finger pad on the screen. Learning to use iOS after years of using Windows also proved challenging. </p> <p>\u201cI bought a book about it, but I wasn\u2019t too diligent about it,\u201d she said. The iPad mostly stays in a drawer. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d88a4a82a2a857f9c9cba1250f314a1c1237b5f3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d88a4a82a2a857f9c9cba1250f314a1c1237b5f3/0_177_4032_2419/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Rose Wong, 102-year-old tech reviewer, shows off her iPad manual.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rose Wong, 102-year-old tech reviewer, shows off her iPad manual.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Julia Carrie Wong/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>She is also wary of social media. In 2008, at the behest of my sister, she joined Facebook, but she\u2019s never taken to it.</p> <p>\u201cPeople come on Facebook and they talk about so many things that are irrelevant,\u201d she said. </p> <p>In the interests of very serious journalism, she agreed to test out Snapchat and Twitter, both of which she had heard about, but never used.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>People come on Facebook and they talk about so many things that are irrelevant</p> <footer> <cite>Rose Wong, 102 years old</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The first time I showed her Snapchat (and its selfie filters), we were eating at a Chinese restaurant with my father.

Do they sell ads? I can\u2019t see the purpose of it.\u201d </p> <p>After we turned the camera around and Snapped my dad with doggie ears, she delivered her verdict: \u201cI think it\u2019s a waste of energy. I don\u2019t have anything positive to say.\u201d </p> <p>A few weeks later, however, we revisited Snapchat and took some more selfies. </p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s fun,\u201d she conceded, \u201cbut to go and <a href=\"http://www.vanityfair.com/news/2016/09/snapchat-could-go-public-early-next-year\">IPO on it</a>? You can only laugh so much. People will get sick of it pretty soon.\u201d </p> <p>I also managed to convince her to try Twitter, using my account.

  "<p>Gospel is not usually the kind of music that attracts tarot-reading, pentagram-tattooed occultists but then Baltimore-born singer Josiah Wise is anything but ordinary. At 28, Wise has shed more musical skins than some artists do in a lifetime: he\u2019s trained as a jazz vocalist, formed a neo-soul group, had a goth phase and was once hellbent on being an opera singer. \u201cBut I didn\u2019t like the idea of having to wear a tux,\u201d he explains, from his Brooklyn apartment.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/sep/02/bjork-digital-vulnicura-vespertine\">Bj\u00f6rk on her inspirations: a drag queen, a videogame, a knitwear prodigy and more</a> </p> </aside>  <p>With his latest project, Serpentwithfeet, Wise has found a niche to call his own, one he dubbed \u201cpagan gospel\u201d. It\u2019s a term that he\u2019s since come to renounce, having lost interest in rituals: \u201cWho needs a crystal ball when you can read a person\u2019s body language,\u201d he reasons. Nevertheless, it\u2019s an apt description for his UK debut EP Blisters, a haunting, R&amp;B-edged take on devotional music.</p> <p>Considering his over-sized septum piercing and generally avant-garde appearance, it\u2019s difficult to picture him as a fresh-faced youth singing for Maryland State Boychoir. But Wise grew up in a fairly strict and religious household; his mum only approved of classical music, and church on Sundays was mandatory. While Wise didn\u2019t care much for the sermons, the atmosphere and congregation of the megachurch he attended stuck with him. \u201cIt was like seeing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/feb/08/beyonce-formation-black-american-narrative-the-margins\">the Beyonc\u00e9 Formation tour</a> but for Jesus,\u201d he recalls.</p> <p>As a teenager still coming to terms with his sexuality, Wise found the asceticism preached there stifling. \u201cIt was impossible to talk about being gay,\u201d he says. Instead, Wise found an outlet through gospel music. \u201cA lot of gospel songs are very erotic. It\u2019s such romantic and decadent music about wanting to be possessed and subsumed by this man. It was only when I started dating that I realised I didn\u2019t know the difference between a guy I was interested in and Jesus.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-audio\" data-canonical-url=\"https://soundcloud.com/tri_angle_records/serpentwithfeet-blisters\"> <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"460\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?visual=true&url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F275611130&show_artwork=true\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>  <p>That ambiguity between the spiritual and the sensual informs the songs on Blisters, which could be as much about faith as a faltering relationship. \u201cI offer myself to you, don\u2019t let me doubt you,\u201d he sings in a pleading vibrato on Flickering, over a backing of piano chords, swelling strings and spine-tingling ambience, produced by Bj\u00f6rk collaborator the Haxan Cloak, now his Tri-Angle labelmate.</p> <p>With Serpentwithfeet, Wise has reconciled his formal musical background with his love for 90s R&amp;B, harmonising like his idols <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/nov/19/faith-evans-posthumous-notorious-big-album\">Faith Evans</a> and Brandy only over minimal classical instrumentation.

  "<p>I was seven years old when my father died. His body was brought home to lie in my gran\u2019s front room. I believed he was my uncle, and could not understand why I had to kiss him every morning and at bedtime. I led the funeral procession, and said goodbye for ever without knowing who he really was. At the time my aunt and uncle were acting as my foster parents after a period of being looked after by my beloved gran and being cared for in a hospital when she could no longer cope. It was 1950 and I was rebellious, described as \u201cimpossible to manage\u201d by my foster parents. I felt unloved and unwanted. </p> <p>It wasn\u2019t until much later in life that I learned my father, who had mental health problems, had been in what was then known as the county asylum for much of the first seven years of my life and when I was just a few months old, my mother had been imprisoned for shoplifting and child neglect. It was decided that I would never be returned to her, or told the truth about my parents. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/social-care-network/social-life-blog/2016/aug/03/social-workers-learn-from-experience-care\">Social workers, please learn from my experience in care</a> </p> </aside>  <p>As I became ever more difficult to control, I was assessed as being in need of prolonged psychiatric and social work help with an urgent recommendation that I should be removed from my foster parents and live where I could experience safety and stability \u2013 the Caldecott Community. Located in a magnificent country mansion in Kent, it had grown from a nursery in London in 1911 to an innovative therapeutic environment headed by its founder, Leila Rendel. It offered a place of safety to distressed children, with the opportunity to grow and take a place in the world.</p> <p>This was well before the recommendations of the <a href=\"http://graham-taylor0.tripod.com/historyoffostercareinenglandandwales19461989/id1.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Curtis Report in 1946</a>, which insisted that children\u2019s homes should serve as \u201cplaces of safety and refuge\u201d for children needing assessment, care and protection. In 1947, with the help of the Nuffield Foundation, Caldecott set up the first assessment centre with the intention of providing evidence and experience for local authorities. Before this, children\u2019s homes were mainly provided by voluntary organisations such as <a href=\"https://www.barnardos.org.uk/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Barnardo\u2019s</a> and the <a href=\"http://www.childrenssociety.org.uk/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Children\u2019s Society</a>, whereas Rendel, along with Barbara Dockar-Drysdale of the Mulberry Bush in Oxford, proposed a much wider and therapeutic response \u2013 the first of the children\u2019s therapeutic communities.</p> <p>Writing at the time, Rendel was clear, she said: \u201cIt is useless to camouflage a children\u2019s home or foster home as a \u2018home from home\u2019. That it could never be. For these children of misfortune, there could be no adequate substitute.\u201d </p> <p>It\u2019s true the Caldecott environment was never \u201chomely\u201d. That was its joy and salvation for children like me who felt out of place in a conventional family. It could cope with our impulse to break out, to run away, to act out feelings of anger and distress. We needed to be able to breathe, and do all these things without fear of sanctions, to be understood and cared for whatever we did. </p> <p>The community met these needs exactly. We had space to express ourselves through education, art, literature, music, sport and work in the garden. We rode horses and bikes, went camping and stayed in youth hostels. We made friends, sometimes for life. The discipline, timekeeping, rituals and continuity created the sense of safety. All of this was a far cry from the suffocation I experienced in the domestic family environment. Although my foster parents were blood relatives, I had nothing in common with them, and reacted against their attempts to control me. </p> <p>During my eight years at Caldecott I thrived on the environment, the opportunities for self-expression, especially through music and drama, and learned how to manage my uncontrollable temper, night fears and dreams, and attempted self-destruction. I responded to the discipline, which was reasonable and fair (not hysterical as at home), and the routine of regular meals, clean clothes, and feeling of being important to my peers and those around me. I was rewarded appropriately for success, and my failures were understood. It did not matter that affection was not overt, this would have frightened me, and many others, who had already learned to distrust adults at an early age. The sense of belonging was most important. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/social-care-network/social-life-blog/2016/apr/20/dont-force-young-people-out-childrens-homes-18\">Don't force young people out of children's homes at 18</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Returning to the family home at the age of 16 was a great challenge for me and within months I was literally thrown out into the snow with nowhere to go. By then, I had learned enough skills to survive and never returned to live with the family again. It would be good to record that I lived \u201chappily ever after\u201d but some of the damage left scars that have never healed. Only in recent years have I fully come to understand the truth about my background and parentage, and this has helped a great deal in resolving some of the questions. The sense of loss and abandonment has never left me. </p> <p>In the 1950s Rendel identified not only the needs of the children at the time but in the future, setting out a strategic plan for the future with children always at the heart. An individual response, assessment, fostering where appropriate, a variety of facilities ranging from small family homes, to larger creative environments for those children who needed more space. Finally, support and aftercare for as long as needed. </p> <p>Rendel, Dockar-Drysdale, and others believed that some children are so hurt, so damaged, so vulnerable, that an escape from family life \u2013 not a return to it \u2013 is what is needed. For those who cannot return to families and for whom fostering is not appropriate, skilful preparation for an independent life in the community is a vital part of any programme. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/sep/20/children-in-care-reunification-failure-nspcc\">Research for the NSPCC</a> has shown that about half of the children who go into care because of abuse or neglect suffer further abuse if they return home and and later have to return to care.</p> <p>It\u2019s hard for me to be objective given my own experience, but I think the organisations that have developed the concept of a more personal approach in smaller living units, while retaining the concept of community, have been and are the most successful.</p> <p><em>This is an edited extract from a piece <a href=\"http://www.thetcj.org/in-residence-articles/child-misfortune-cyril\" rel=\"nofollow\">originally published in the Therapeutic Care Journal</a>. </em></p> <p><strong><a href=\"https://register.theguardian.com/social-care/\">Join the Social Care Network</a> to read more pieces like this.

  "<p>How can we preserve freedom of expression when societies are under attack from terrorism? Following the Isis attacks, heightened security in European capitals has made it more difficult to preserve our hard-won rights and freedoms.</p> <p>While we want to be safe, we also want to retain our rights to personal privacy and to free expression. If we sacrifice those rights within our liberal democracies then the terrorists will have secured a victory of sorts.</p> <p>Indeed, the likelihood is that a more authoritarian society will engender increased recruitment to terrorist groups. So what can be done?<br></p> <p>Dunja Mijatovi\u0107, the energetic representative on freedom of the media for <a href=\"http://www.osce.org/what/media-freedom\">the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe</a> (OSCE), has come up with a practical guide aimed at ensuring the survival of our rights and values.</p> <p>In <a href=\"https://www.indexoncensorship.org/2016/09/dunja-mijatovic-fight-terror-not-fight-basic-human-rights/\">an article published by Index on Censorship</a>, she argues that counter-terrorism measures must comply with international standards, most notably article 19 of the <a href=\"http://www.ohchr.org/en/professionalinterest/pages/ccpr.aspx\">UN covenant on civil and political rights</a>.</p> <p>Her major concern is to ensure that journalists can carry out their role with the greatest possible freedom so that they can continue to inform the public.</p> <p>To that end, she has drawn a set of practical guidelines \u2013 a wish-list, if you like \u2013 that she believes the OSCE\u2019s participating states should take on board when introducing anti-terrorism legislation:</p> <ul> <li>Ensure journalists\u2019 freedom and safety at all times, including while reporting on terrorism.</li> <li>Recognise that free expression and the use of new technologies are also tools to fight terrorism by creating social cohesion and expressing alternative narratives.</li> <li>Define, in line with international human rights law, the notions of violent extremism, terrorism, radicalisation and other terms used in legislation, programmes and initiatives aimed to prevent and counter terrorism.</li> <li>Acknowledge that the media has a right to report on terrorism. Requests for media blackouts of terrorist activities must be avoided and media should be free to consider, based on ethical standards and editorial guidelines, available information to publish in the public interest.</li> <li>Respect the right of journalists to protect sources and provide a legal framework securing adequate judicial scrutiny before law enforcement and intelligence agencies can access journalists\u2019 material in terror investigations.</li> <li>Refrain from indiscriminate mass surveillance because of its chilling effect on free expression and journalism. Targeted surveillance should be used only when strictly necessary, with judicial authorisation and independent control mechanisms in place.</li> <li>Acknowledge that anonymity and encryption technologies may be the only guarantee for safe and secure communications for journalists and, therefore, are a prerequisite for the right to exercise freedom of expression. Blanket prohibitions are disproportionate and therefore unacceptable.</li> <li>Ensure that restrictions on content are applicable only if they can be demonstrated as threats to national security, such as an intention to incite imminent violence.</li> </ul> <p>Mijatovi\u0107 concludes: \u201cAdherence to these simple rules is necessary because limiting the space for free expression and civic space advances the goals of those promoting, threatening and using terrorism and violence.</p> <p>\u201cIf we give up on our fundamental freedoms we will erode the very substance of democracy and the rule of law.\u201d</p>",

Kev and I really had to be at our best because we were up against Marcel Desailly, who had won the World Cup 18 months earlier. I think what we\u2019re most pleased about isn\u2019t that we both scored two or that we won 4-1; it\u2019s that Desailly went off at half-time and played the next match three days later, which told us he wanted to get out of town. That was the biggest compliment he could have paid us.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d9ec48e3190db204b9a225f2e8a68a2b7aba76fc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d9ec48e3190db204b9a225f2e8a68a2b7aba76fc/0_172_3072_1841/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Niall Quinn and Marcel Desailly\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Niall Quinn harasses Marcel Desailly at the Stadium of Light in 1999.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Michael Steele/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>You finished seventh in consecutive seasons, yet it might have been ever better. </strong>Yeah, both seasons we were third on Boxing Day and had tough games out of the way. We had great belief in the team but we always got tired after Christmas. The buzz didn\u2019t last the full season, unlike Leicester last year.</p> <p><strong>Why do you think that was? </strong>I don\u2019t know. It might have helped if we had better rotation. To finish high up the league you need 22 top players, which we didn\u2019t have. We had a team that worked fairly rigidly. We fancied ourselves when we had Summerbee and Johnston on the wings and Kev and I up front, but if one of us got injured it upset the whole thing. Ultimately I was getting old too, and as the season wore on I wasn\u2019t at my best. But there\u2019s no real regrets because we achieved as much as we could.</p> <p>I always think Summerbee and Johnston deserve a mention because we were spoilt rotten with the quality and the ability those guys had. It\u2019s an art that isn\u2019t as prevalent anymore but they were two of the finest crossers of the ball I\u2019ve ever had the pleasure to train and work with.</p> <p><strong>Kevin Phillips is still <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Golden_Shoe\">the only Englishman to win the European Golden Shoe</a> with his 30 league goals in 1999-2000. Is he a great advert for not having too much too soon in football? </strong>Absolutely. When he came in the door none of us knew anything about him. He wasn\u2019t even a makeweight \u2013 Peter Reid has admitted that he wanted to sign David Connolly. All I\u2019d read is that he had stacked shelves but he walked in and brought this indomitable spirit. He just wanted to achieve. He scored on his debut and it was like seeing a greyhound out of the traps. He was great fun to be around, a terrific guy and a terrific friend. I don\u2019t speak to him often but I have nothing but great memories from my time with him and his family. I just hope one day he gets old and stiff and I\u2019ll be able to beat him at golf.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d008c72f4db346be1174c74dec4fc6c6e9fa3159\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d008c72f4db346be1174c74dec4fc6c6e9fa3159/183_131_2847_1707/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Kevin Phillips\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Kevin Phillips scores a brilliant goal in Sunderland\u2019s 4-1 win over Chelsea in 1999.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Michael Steele/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>He scored some great goals, including a screamer when you battered Chelsea... </strong>He scored every kind of goal. He scored volleys from outside the box; he scored a lot of headers; he could delicately pass it into the corner out of the reach of the keeper, then when it was on his left foot he could blast it. His favourite one was to bend it in the top-right corner. He\u2019d put it three or four yards outside the post and bring it back, so the keeper thought it was going wide and suddenly it would end up in the top corner. Once he got the ball out of his feet and on the move his accuracy was frightening really. There wasn\u2019t a goal he couldn\u2019t score. It was a great time for north-east football because as well as Kev you had players like [Alan] Shearer and [Fabrizio] Ravanelli scoring loads of goals.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TmYnGeRPUmY\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/TmYnGeRPUmY?wmode=opaque\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p><strong>Did you work on your partnership with him? </strong>It was all natural. Anyone who trained with Kev would know he didn\u2019t pass the ball so I always made sure I was on the other team in training. But when match day came around he understood his role. His reading of the game \u2013 which was pure instinct \u2013 was brilliant. He had an idea where things would end up and would always lose his man and get into dangerous areas.</p> <p>We only worked on one or two small things \u2013 like if I was going for a ball in the air I would always angle my body to head it inside, rather than flick it on straight or outside, because if he got on the end of it he would be nearer his shooting position. That was all we spoke about. We\u2019d say \u201cinside\u201d quite a lot to each other on the pitch. </p> <p><strong>Did you practise your heading? </strong>I always practised my heading even though I was good at it. It was more about timing and the flight of the ball, which a lot of people don\u2019t read that well. The second the ball left the goalkeeper\u2019s foot I knew where it was going to be at its maximum point that I could head it. Before every game, while everyone else was running around cones and doing fancy little dances with ladders and ropes, I would get the goalkeeper to take half a dozen kick-outs so I knew exactly where it was going.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a91712deed4be5a6aab65b549d8a127938ca29b4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a91712deed4be5a6aab65b549d8a127938ca29b4/63_0_791_988/400.jpg\" alt=\"Ramon Vega and Niall Quinn\" width=\"400\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Niall Quinn holds off Spurs defender Ramon Vega at White Hart Lane in 2000-01.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kirsty Wigglesworth/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>With your height, did you feel unplayable at times? </strong>I think I knew an awful lot more later in my career about how to get an advantage. When I was young, I was naive. I ran around too much, I tried to do things way too early in the buildup, I wasn\u2019t as strong physically and I didn\u2019t have the brain power that I had later in my career. And then obviously my touch developed because I played head-tennis every day \u2026</p> <p><strong>How does head-tennis improve your touch? </strong>We call it head-tennis but foot-tennis is probably a better description. Imagine Wimbledon with the court being half the size but the net being the same. You have two vs two and you get two touches each before the ball has to go to the other side. We played for a fiver or a tenner in those days, that was enough to get people warmed up and wanting to win. I\u2019m not sure it\u2019d be enough these days but I\u2019d implore any young kid who\u2019s got athletic ability, can shoot or score goals but needs to work on his touch, to play head-tennis.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We weren\u2019t heading to the big places in London; we were happy in Seaham playing shove ha\u2019penny at three in the morning</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p><strong>When did you start playing that? </strong>The first time I played was when I joined Manchester City. It was me and Peter Reid against the doctor and the physio \u2013 and they beat us, because I was hopeless. Peter Reid was disgusted. I\u2019d been at the club a day and I was a big signing. You can imagine what the rest of the dressing room said. So I made it my business to improve and I\u2019m still quite proud of that. I played it every day after that and I\u2019d like to think I was one of the best head-tennis players that Sunderland or Man City saw.</p> <p><strong>You scored some superb lobs and chips in your career. Did it help with those? </strong>Absolutely. If somebody\u2019s at the net you have to get it over their head and down, like in real tennis. I would have picked that skill up there for sure.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZF-DgsOf0LA\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"345\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ZF-DgsOf0LA?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p><strong>Did you get enough credit for how good you were on the floor? </strong>I didn\u2019t need people to say I was anything I wasn\u2019t, and that\u2019s not what drove me. It was nice was when people said, \u201cYou\u2019re a bit better than we thought\u201d, and that was as much as I was ever going to get. I always had a good feeling when somebody said that.</p> <p><strong>Those head-tennis games must have been good for team spirit as well? </strong>Brilliant. And also you want pride; you don\u2019t want your touch to look bad in front of your team-mates. It\u2019s a bit like being a peacock; you want to show your colours. It was a great way of improving without coaches shouting at you. We had three fabulous tennis courts outside the dressing room at Sunderland\u2019s training ground. I used to run leagues and all the players would join in, from the first team to the kids. Imagine doing something as enjoyable as that for your living every day. I\u2019m still doing it. I turn 50 next month and I\u2019ve got the lads down the village into it so that\u2019s how it much it meant to me.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/aug/19/golden-goal-david-beckham-manchester-united-wimbledon-1996-halfway-line\">Golden Goal: David Beckham for Manchester United against Wimbledon (1996)</a> </p> </aside>  <p>I knew my time was up in 2002 when Howard Wilkinson walked in, saw us all playing head-tennis and very publicly ordered the groundsman to get rid of the tennis courts immediately. I was gone within a week. Nothing against Howard \u2013 everyone brings their own ideas into the club \u2013 but that was the end of my time at Sunderland.</p> <p><strong>Peter Reid was the manager for most of your time there. What made him so good? </strong>He was a great motivator. We had a fairly simple system. He and his No 2, Bobby Saxton, had a way of playing that was drilled into the players \u2013 we bought into that, and we had someone who scored loads of goals. There are many parts to management but I think getting Kevin Phillips to come from Watford to Sunderland and turning him into somebody who won the European Golden Boot shows what Peter Reid can do in terms of getting the best out of people. A number of players would thank him for what he did for their careers \u2013 Paul Butler, Jody Craddock and many others.</p> <p><strong>He left the club within 18 months of finishing seventh in 2000-01. What went wrong? </strong>I think that in trying to replace that team he bought B-list foreign players, and also maybe not enough of them had the spirit that had been driven into us. The big deals didn\u2019t work out: Lilian Laslandes, Tore Andre Flo, there were quite a few. I\u2019m not being critical of those players because I know what it\u2019s like \u2013 some places work for you and some don\u2019t. But Peter was great for me at Manchester City, where I blossomed as a player, and then at Sunderland for the last six years of my career. I\u2019ll always be more then grateful to him.</p> <p><strong>You had some great moments against Newcastle in that time as well, including your winning goal in 2000-01. </strong>That particular day I felt as good as at any time in my career. The derbies were great fun in those days. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-_NOH2X05w\">It was on the back of a similar win before in the August monsoon rain</a> the previous season, which signalled the end of Ruud Gullit as Newcastle manager. To repeat the dose a year later was very special. Sir Bobby Robson was manager and they were heading for the Champions League. Alan Shearer had come again and it was an important game. I\u2019d have it right up there with the Chelsea game.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lgvunhc-My4\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"345\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Lgvunhc-My4?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p><strong>How would you celebrate wins like the ones against Newcastle or Chelsea? </strong>It was simpler than in today\u2019s world, where the guys have cameraphones on their tail everywhere they go. There was a lad called Big Adie who was a good friend of ours \u2013 he was a big Sunderland fan and had a pub called the Phoenix in Seaham. So we had Phoenix nights, and usually we\u2019d all be in the car park collecting our cars the next day after leaving them there the night before. That was never the plan but especially if we won we\u2019d end up having a good night with the guys and the wives. It was a close-knit thing, we weren\u2019t getting flights to London and heading to the big places; no we were happy enough in Seaham playing shove ha\u2019penny at three o\u2019clock in the morning.</p> <p><strong>Has that side of team bonding been lost? </strong>I\u2019m not sure it would be right to reintroduce anything like that but the tough thing for the modern players is it\u2019s very hard to be part of your community. We were able to breeze in and out of the chip shop, breeze in and out of the pub and it was fine. You weren\u2019t expected to be aloof. I sometimes get annoyed when I see players walk past fans wearing these big headphones. Give me my day any day \u2013 and I mean that. You could offer me 10 years earning all the money in the world, and with big headphones to cocoon myself, and I wouldn\u2019t take it.

  "<p>The San Diego Chargers kick off two campaigns this week.</p> <p>The team kick off their NFL season against division rival Kansas City, and conventional wisdom says campaign season started too, as the franchise tries to win voter approval for a downtown stadium. </p> <p>Expert forecasts suggest the chances of winning that vote are even grimmer than the team\u2019s chances of winning the AFC West. </p> <p>The Chargers are <a href=\"http://www.voiceofsandiego.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Final-SD-Initiative-03_30_16_1230am.pdf\">asking voters</a> to increase hotel taxes by 4% to help underwrite a $1.8bn stadium and convention center next door to the Padres\u2019 Petco Park. The league and team pay <a href=\"https://www.sandiego.gov/sites/default/files/16_20_fiscal_impact_statement_measure_c.pdf\">roughly $650m of the cost</a>, with the tourism tax covering the rest.</p> <p>In California, though, tax increases for specific projects \u2013 like a football stadiums \u2013 need two-thirds voter approval, not a simple majority.</p> <p>That\u2019s why virtually everyone involved in San Diego city politics expects it to fail \u2013 including people in charge of getting it passed.</p> <p>\u201cFor the people who say it isn\u2019t going to pass, they\u2019re not exactly going out on a limb and certifying themselves as political geniuses,\u201d said Mark Fabiani, Chargers special counsel and the man in charge of getting the team a new stadium for the last decade. \u201cI don\u2019t know what credit people should get for saying something so obvious.\u201d</p> <p>And he has a point. Not many votes clear a 66% threshold. For instance, when Arlington, Texas, voters agreed to spend $325m on a Cowboys stadium that would nonetheless be called \u201cThe House that Jerry Built\u201d, <a href=\"http://www.arlington-tx.gov/citysecretary/wp-content/uploads/sites/14/2014/05/November-2-2004-Stadium-Election-Results.pdf\">just 55%</a> of voters agreed. Just 53% of Denver-area voters approved a new Broncos stadium.</p> <p>But it isn\u2019t just the high bar that makes the team\u2019s proposal improbable. </p> <p>The Chargers have less support in San Diego than other teams in their home markets said John Nienstedt, a San Diego-based pollster who has tested the public\u2019s view of various Chargers measures since 2004.</p> <p>\u201cAny conversation of this starts with, we\u2019re not Pittsburgh, and the Chargers are not the Steelers, or the Packers, Cowboys or Seahawks,\u201d Nienstedt said. </p> <p>Right now, he said, just 20% of San Diegans consider themselves big Chargers fans, the lowest he\u2019s ever seen and far below the 40% seen in other cities. Fabiani disputes this. He said TV ratings and other measures of popularity don\u2019t support it.</p> <p>And San Diegans have their reasons to be disillusioned.</p> <p>The Chargers spent all last year trying to relocate to Los Angeles with the Raiders, the team\u2019s most hated rival. They even said farewell in their last home game, potentially making this season one of those awkward second goodbyes when you can\u2019t quite leave a party.</p> <p>The bad times aren\u2019t all recent. In 1997, the city agreed to purchase all unsold tickets to Chargers\u2019 games, guaranteeing the team a sellout every week. It cost the city $36.4m <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/news/story?id=1839120\">until the City Council ended</a> it in 2004. And the city\u2019s still on the hook for nearly $5m a year through 2026 from debt payments on a 1990s renovation of a Qualcomm Stadium that could soon be empty. </p> <p>\u201cIf you look at the history, there\u2019s a healthy skepticism of these big projects, and the Chargers have done nothing substantive over the years to alleviate that skepticism,\u201d Nienstedt said.</p> <p>Between the team\u2019s relationship with the city and a quirk of California tax law, the Chargers are starting from farther back, and have longer to go in the first place.</p> <p>Which might not be such a problem, <a href=\"http://www.voiceofsandiego.org/topics/government/san-diego-politicos-pan-chargers-convadium-plan/\">if they had support</a> from city leaders.</p> <p>The city\u2019s business-friendly mayor has gone out of his way not to take a position. The tourism industry with which he\u2019s closely aligned \u2013 and which, as expected in a city known for beaches, Sea World and the zoo, is politically influential \u2013 strongly <a href=\"http://connect.sandiego.org/2016/09/02/sdta-and-hma-statement-on-stadium-ballot-initiatives/\">opposes</a> it. Residents of a nearby, historically Latino community <a href=\"http://www.voiceofsandiego.org/topics/arts/barrio-logan/\">have warned</a> it will gentrify their neighborhood. <a href=\"http://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/news/2016/sep/04/pressure-grows-on-faulconer-over-stadium/\">Business leaders</a> and elected officials from both parties have <a href=\"http://www.nodowntownstadium.com/\">formed a committee</a> to pay for ads against it.</p> <p>Even <a href=\"http://www.voiceofsandiego.org/topics/land-use/exclusive-padres-chairman-outlines-chargers-stadium-concerns/\">the Padres have big problems</a> with the plan. The team insists it wants the Chargers to stay, but has criticized problems the stadium would cause if it was built next door to their ballpark.</p> <p>It\u2019s enough to make you wonder, why are the Chargers even bothering?</p> <p>At the time the team launched the initiative, Fabiani said, the team thought it had a chance to get key interest groups and elected leaders on board. It\u2019s easy now to say it\u2019s doomed, but the team didn\u2019t calculate that it would receive so little support.</p> <p>Yet the team isn\u2019t without allies. The regional Chamber of Commerce and local construction unions are on board, as is a congressman who\u2019s increasingly vocal in his support.</p> <p>And so, Fabiani said, it\u2019s too early to say the Chargers can\u2019t win. Especially given the team\u2019s unique circumstance: the league has already approved its relocation to Los Angeles and to move into Rams owner Stan Kroenke\u2019s new, state-of-the-art facility. If the Chargers don\u2019t exercise the option this year, they can extend it for one more season, before the Raiders get a chance to move in instead.</p> <p>\u201cThis is a one-of-a-kind measure,\u201d Fabiani said. \u201cYou have a team that has a viable option to play someplace else, trying to put together a plan to stay.\u201d</p> <p>He said it\u2019s still possible the presidential election could drive turnout that helps the team, and no one should write off its chances of winning.</p> <p>Fabiani\u2019s framing is consistent with <a href=\"http://www.mighty1090.com/episode/how-does-attacking-chris-cate-help-the-chargers-stadium-bid/\">a recent social media ad the team paid for</a>, targeting a councilman who had emerged as the most outspoken critic of the team\u2019s proposal.</p> <p>\u201cWhy does Chris Cate want the Chargers to leave San Diego? Please call and ask him,\u201d the ad read, listing his office\u2019s phone number.</p> <p>The message seems clear: a vote against the measure is a vote for the Chargers to leave town.</p> <p>But Fabiani insists neither should be seen as a threat. Sort of.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ve been careful never to say that, and that\u2019s not the case,\u201d Fabiani said. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t want to predict what would happen if we don\u2019t win this election, but I think people understand the obvious fact that if we don\u2019t win we don\u2019t have another clear option.\u201d</p>",

  "<p>Sports Direct shareholders have told founder Mike Ashley and chairman Keith Hellawell they still want a fully independent review of working practices and governance after City investors voted for Hellawell\u2019s removal.</p> <p>At a summit on Wednesday <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/sep/07/sports-direct-board-turned-down-chairman-keith-hellawell-resignation\">after Sports Direct\u2019s fraught annual general meeting</a>, the Investor Forum, which represents the company\u2019s institutional shareholders, told the board a further review being carried out by a law firm linked to the company was not independent enough.</p> <p>Phineas Glover, senior adviser at the Investor Forum, said the meeting was the most constructive shareholders had held with Hellawell and Ashley. He added that Hellawell appeared to understand the gravity of the situation, but he said independent shareholders, who voted on Wednesday against Hellawell\u2019s reappointment, wanted results and that an independent review of the company was needed.</p> <p>Referring to the likelihood that a further vote on Hellawell will be held once a three-month embargo expires, in which Ashley can use his 55% stake to overrule independent investors, he said: \u201cThe next three months are very crucial, not least for the business but for Keith as well. We have committed to work with Keith and he has committed to work with us and we have expectations from that and we will see where we get to. If you have received [more than] 50% opposition from your independent shareholders it\u2019s a very clear message and we expect it to be heeded.\u201d</p> <p>Legal &amp; General, one of the UK\u2019s most powerful investment firms, had called for Hellawell\u2019s immediate resignation after Wednesday\u2019s vote but Ashley asked for 12 months to turn the business around. </p> <p>The Investor Forum was set up in 2014 to represent investors with \u00a3850bn invested in UK shares to push for change at companies.

In an effort to assuage shareholders, Sports Direct said RPC would conduct a further review, taking in corporate governance, that would report in the next year.</p> <p>At the meeting on Wednesday, shareholders told the board RPC was not independent enough to carry out the review alone and that they wanted a report much earlier. A trade union resolution at the AGM calling for an independent review received strong backing from independent shareholders.</p> <p>Glover said options for an independent review included using a different law firm or having RPC\u2019s report overseen by an expert acceptable to shareholders. The Investor Forum did not disclose which shareholders were at the meeting with the board but Standard Life, Legal &amp; General and Aviva Investors, three of the biggest owners of UK shares, were in attendance.</p> <p>Hellawell, the former chief constable of West Yorkshire police, said on the day of the AGM he would prove to his opponents that he had a contribution to make to Sports Direct. He said he would leave in a year if independent shareholders still wanted him to go.</p> <p>Shareholders have been pressing for better corporate governance at Sports Direct for the past few years as suspicions increased that Hellawell and other non-executive directors did not keep a check on Ashley\u2019s dominance. The Investor Forum said shareholders had jointly held eight meetings with Sports Direct since March 2014. </p> <p>Glover said: \u201cOver the last three or four years there has been a sense that we are making progress but \u2026 the changes, we found, were not enough or nowhere near what was expected to improve the overall corporate governance framework of the company.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>At about 7.15 on Monday evening an anxious face appeared at my kitchen window and asked if I was all right.

Hence the neighbourly check.</p> <p>The fictional Helen\u2019s neighbours were conspicuously absent during her years in Blossom Hill Cottage, but they can hardly be blamed. The coercive and controlling abuse she suffered is, for the most part, distinguished by being undistinguished \u2013 the details so ordinary, so mundane that even she couldn\u2019t see what she was worried about, much less explain it.</p> <p>In fact, as Helen became more cut off from family and friends she worried only about herself. Any facts she thought she knew were essentially her husband\u2019s and mother-in-law\u2019s propaganda, manipulated and turned around to make her doubt her own judgment and, eventually, sanity.</p> <p>The introduction of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/dec/29/domestic-abuse-law-controlling-coercive-behaviour\" title=\"\">new laws</a>, and The Archers, have done much to raise the profile of this kind of abuse, but it remains largely misunderstood. Given its chimerical nature, how would you know what to guard against, or whether you\u2019re already in a relationship of this type? It is, after all, very different to the beast we think we know \u2013 the one that comes with bruises and broken bones.

If anyone does ask, you generally lie. This is what Helen did, and no one (except Kirsty) had a clue what she was going through. It\u2019s not that you\u2019re actually told to lie. You do it because it\u2019s easier than telling the truth. And, like Helen, by the time the lies start, you won\u2019t have a firm grasp on what the truth is anyway.</p> <p>Becoming a good liar is a big part of your defence, although by doing so you\u2019re actually colluding with your abuser. It is something he will invariably use against you, although he\u2019s the reason you do it. It\u2019s all part of the pattern. You find yourself doing it all the time.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>\u2018I can\u2019t live without you' is the biggest lie of all.

He will protest that he does this because he worries, he cares, and he can\u2019t live without you. Those are his lies. I say \u201che\u201d, by the way, because that is my experience.</p> <p>\u201cI can\u2019t live without you\u201d is the biggest lie of all. It will probably be used to bait the trap. If you feel yourself being swept off your feet, and it\u2019s all just a little bit too full-on, be careful and listen to your gut. This is especially important if you\u2019ve just come out of a relationship, are bereaved, or are generally having a terrible time and feeling vulnerable.</p> <p>In my case, it was all of the above. My guard was down and I ignored the clues. By the time he had gone through my wardrobe, chucked out what he didn\u2019t like and bought me new clothes, it was too late.

  "<p>It was 26 August 2003, almost two years since 9/11, and the sickening plume of smoke that hung over Ground Zero in lower Manhattan had long since dissipated. But steam was rising from the steps of city hall, three blocks away, where Hillary Clinton was venting her rage at the Bush administration for having lied to the American people.<br></p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t think any of us expected that our government would knowingly deceive us about something as sacred as the air we breathe,\u201d she said, her voice tightening in anger. \u201cThe air that our children breathe in schools, that our valiant first responders were facing on the pile.\u201d</p> <p>Surrounded by firefighters and the doctors who were treating them for respiratory and other illnesses incurred when they worked on the massive mound of Ground Zero rubble \u2013 the \u201cpile\u201d, as it was known \u2013 the junior senator from New York was incandescent. Audiotape recorded at the time by <a href=\"http://wnyc.org/\">WNYC</a>, the city\u2019s public radio affiliate, captures a Clinton quite unlike the controlled public figure who is now a step away from the White House.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Hillary Clinton, City Hall New York, August 2003\">  <iframe frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" height=\"130\" width=\"100%\" src=\"https://www.wnyc.org/widgets/ondemand_player/wnyc/#file=/audio/json/661422/\"></iframe> <figcaption><a href=\"http://www.wnyc.org/people/andrea-bernstein/\">Andrea Bernstein</a>, senior editor politics and policy for WNYC, listens back to Hillary Clinton\u2019s comments in the wake of 9/11. <em>If you are experiencing audio issues in Safari please try an alternative browser.</em></figcaption> </figure>  <p>The Clinton who emerges from the WNYC tapes is passionate, raw and unrestrained. Above all, she is livid. She had just learned that the <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2003/08/27/nyregion/clinton-and-nadler-seek-inquiry-into-epa-response-to-sept-11.html\">Bush administration</a> instructed officials of the federal Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to reassure New Yorkers after 9/11 that the air over Ground Zero was safe. In fact, they had a pretty good idea that it was a toxic pall of asbestos, cement, glass dust, heavy metals, fuels and PCBs.</p> <p>\u201cI am outraged,\u201d Clinton went on. \u201cIn the immediate aftermath, the first couple of days, nobody could know. But a week later? Two weeks later? Two months later? Six months later? Give me a break!\u201d</p> <p>Of all the varied chapters of Clinton\u2019s tumultuous 30 years in public life, the story of her response to the attacks on the twin towers is one of the richest in terms of the clues it provides as to what to expect from a Clinton presidency. It reveals elements of her character, of her domestic policy strengths, as well as her tendency to lean towards the hawkish side in international affairs.</p> <p>As the 15th anniversary of 9/11 approaches, the memories of those days, and her role in them, remain fresh for many who stood by her side. Richard Alles was on the smoldering pile on 12 September, the day after the attacks, when Clinton turned up and proclaimed: \u201cThis attack on New York is an attack on America, it\u2019s an attack on every American.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ed07223da4d56bc87413c73ba204421215789557\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ed07223da4d56bc87413c73ba204421215789557/0_23_1728_1037/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Hillary Clinton greets New York City firefighters at the funeral for department chaplain the Rev Mychal Judge, who died at the World Trade Center.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Hillary Clinton greets New York City firefighters at the funeral for department chaplain the Rev Mychal Judge, who died at the World Trade Center.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dave Hogan/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Then a uniformed firefighter with battalion 58 in Canarsie, Brooklyn, Alles arrived at Ground Zero 20 minutes after the second tower collapsed. He stayed there for two days and nights, seeking survivors amid the ruins. What struck him most about Clinton that day, he said, was what he called her \u201ccompassion\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cShe really went out of her way to speak to the first responders on the site to reassure them,\u201d he said. \u201cI never forgot it.\u201d</p> <p>Alles was also struck by how Clinton quickly grasped the potential health risks of Ground Zero, and how doggedly she pursued treatment for those who suffered. \u201cWe all knew from the get-go that the air was contaminated,\u201d he said, \u201cbut we had a job to do so we kept on working. Senator Clinton was at the forefront over dealing with it, she showed herself to be a fighter.\u201d</p> <p>On 9/11, Peter Gorman was president of the <a href=\"http://www.ufoa.org/\">Uniformed Fire Officers Association of New York City</a>, a union that represents largely white, blue-collar workers of the sort who today might back Donald Trump. The union had pointedly put its weight behind Clinton\u2019s opponent in the 2000 senatorial race, Republican Rick Lazio. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It took Clinton to put a spotlight on the issue and change the frame</p> <footer> <cite>Ben Chevat</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Yet Gorman recalls being pleasantly surprised by Clinton\u2019s commitment, both in terms of her mastery of policy detail and on a personal level. \u201cShe would call me on my cellphone to ask how I was doing, how my members were doing,\u201d he said. \u201cOne time I was pumping gas at a Texaco station, it was Christmas Eve, and she wanted to know how things were going. When a senator calls someone on my level, that\u2019s impressive.\u201d</p> <p>That same personal care made a profound impression on <a href=\"http://laurenmanning.com/\">Lauren Manning</a>, one of very few people who survived severe injuries from the planes crashing into the towers. She was engulfed by a fireball of jet fuel as she was entering the elevators in the north tower to go up to work at Cantor Fitzgerald, on the 105th floor.</p> <p>She was burned on 83% of her body; 658 of her colleagues died.</p> <p>A few months later, Manning was in treatment at the Burke rehabilitation hospital in White Plains, New York, when she had a visitor. Clinton walked into her small hospital room and \u201cembraced me as best she could\u201d, she said. \u201cShe was kind and gentle, and she very specifically said to me that she was here for me and that she would remain at my side.\u201d</p> <p>Manning, who gave a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7M5veiz4RY\">keynote speech</a> on behalf of Clinton at the Democratic national convention in July, said that her most vivid memory was of the senator\u2019s eyes. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d82baa7bdc816d3b2c9724da8fc27f394b10454d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d82baa7bdc816d3b2c9724da8fc27f394b10454d/0_168_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Hillary Clinton attends a memorial event at Ground Zero.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Hillary Clinton attends a memorial event at Ground Zero.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jennifer S. Altman/WireImage</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cI was covered and swathed in bandages,\u201d she said, \u201cdealing with a great deal of pain, but she captured me with her eyes. They were wide open and expressive, and they remained on mine. She didn\u2019t lose sight of what I was saying to her. To me, that was the mark of somebody who is sincere, who you want on your side.\u201d</p> <p>Having declared 9/11 to be an attack on all Americans, Clinton soon discovered that the national response was not entirely united or favorable to struggling New Yorkers. The head of the EPA at the time, Christine Todd Whitman, <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/04/22/AR2008042202807.html\">repeatedly insisted</a> the air at Ground Zero was safe even as early as three days after the towers collapsed, as did Mayor Rudy Giuliani despite <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/14/nyregion/14giuliani.html\">worries within City Hall</a> that they were facing thousands of liability claims. </p> <p>Confronted by this wall of denial, Clinton was one of the most powerful voices warning of an impending health crisis. Ben Chevat, chief of staff to congresswoman Carolyn Maloney of New York on 9/11, recalls the impact. </p> <p>\u201cThe Bush administration was saying, \u2018There\u2019s no problem, move along\u2019,\u201d he said, \u201cand so it was hard work getting any traction in the media. Yet we knew there was a problem because people were getting sick with respiratory diseases and cancers.\u201d</p> <p>Chevat, now executive director of 9/11 Health Watch, said: \u201cIt took Clinton to put a spotlight on the issue and change the frame.\u201d</p> <h2>\u2018She was a sponge for knowledge\u2019</h2> <p>Clinton and her allies started small but over time succeeded in dramatically expanding the health program for those who became ill after<strong> <br></strong>9/11. Within weeks of the attacks she had helped secure $12m for a pilot project at Mount Sinai hospital, screening some 9,000 workers with suspected Ground Zero illnesses.</p> <p>By April 2004 the program had grown to a $90m fund offering three free medical exams a year to 50,000 first responders and residents of lower Manhattan. In 2010, Clinton having passed on the baton to her successor in the US senate, Kirsten Gillibrand, reluctant Republicans in Congress were cajoled into passing the <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/23/nyregion/23health.html\">$4bn Zadroga Act</a>, covering the health costs of those impaired by the toxic fumes. Last year the <a href=\"http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/zadroga-act-reauthorization-finally-passes-congress-article-1.2470110\">program was extended</a> for 75 years, and <a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/wtc/ataglance.html#overall\">now serves</a> 65,000 emergency responders and almost 10,000 9/11 resident survivors.</p> <p>Philip Landrigan, who hosted the first World Trade Center medical program at Mount Sinai, puts this success story in no small part down to Clinton\u2019s relentless pursuit of the subject coupled with her attention to detail. </p> <p>\u201cShe was angry at the Washington political leaders who would come to Ground Zero, have photos taken and then go back to DC and do nothing,\u201d he said.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d111ac54e43f26fd8d6bea618007889fc5a7d3f5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d111ac54e43f26fd8d6bea618007889fc5a7d3f5/0_31_2000_1200/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Hillary Clinton tours the site of the World Trade Center the day after 9/11 with mayor Rudolph Giuliani and governor George Pataki.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Hillary Clinton tours the site of the World Trade Center the day after 9/11 with Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and Governor George Pataki, left.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Robert F Bukaty/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cShe became deeply knowledgable on the subject, not just fiscal and administrative details, but also about medical and mental health problems. She was a sponge for knowledge.\u201d</p> <p>Clinton\u2019s powerful engagement in the 9/11 health cause makes for a strong contrast with how her presidential rival, Donald Trump, spent his time in the wake of the terrorist attacks. He used a loophole in federal funding to help small businesses hurt by the disaster to claim <a href=\"http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/donald-trump-9-11-funds-program-net-150g-payday-article-1.2641951\">$150,000 in subsidies</a> for a Wall Street real estate project.</p> <p>Yet when it comes to this year\u2019s presidential race, several of the people who worked closely with Clinton after 9/11 said they were puzzled by her struggle to win over voters. As a senator operating on the ground, and one to one, she came across as an effective and empathetic leader, they said. Writ large across the nation, her persona struggled to come across.</p> <p>\u201cShe may not be the most natural politician,\u201d said former firefighters union president Peter Gorman. \u201cI regret that sometimes she doesn\u2019t come across well in front of a crowd as people don\u2019t know her as so many of us do.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>While they were growing up all [younger officers] heard was this bad stuff about Clinton \u2013 the damage has been done</p> <footer> <cite>Richard Alles</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Alles, the firefighter, put her troubles with popularity in 2016 \u2013 she has an <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/other/clinton_favorableunfavorable-1131.html\">unfavorable rating</a> of 55%, according to the RealClearPolitics.com average of polls \u2013 down to the criticism she has endured from political opponents and enemies over decades, from Whitewater in the 1990s to Benghazi and the email controversy today.

The controversial decision \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2015/may/19/hillary-clinton-iraq-war-mistake\">the hardest of her political life, she has said</a> \u2013 was predicated on her response to the collapse of the twin towers.</p> <p>As she told WNYC\u2019s Brian Lehrer, the 9/11 attacks \u201cmarked me, and made me feel [fighting terrorism] was my No1 obligation as a senator\u201d.</p> <p>Micah Zenko, senior fellow at the <a href=\"http://www.cfr.org/\">Council on Foreign Relations</a>, who has studied Clinton\u2019s changing approach to Iraq, suggested her views were more nuanced and thoughtful than she has been credited for.

After a few more sets in room three, I was moved to room one. It was the stuff of dreams. Before I had that break, I used to keep the odd Friday off from DJing so I could go to Fabric with my friends \u2013 those nights were magical, some of the greatest I\u2019ve ever experienced. I remember how much I dreamed of playing there, to be in control of that sound system, the atmosphere, the lights, those elements that gave it an edge over other venues. I never in a million years would have expected things to turn out how they did, but every time I played there, I reminded myself of what it was like to be on the other side of the booth, on the floor, waiting for that experience you\u2019d never forget. London has lost a very special place, and 250 people have lost their jobs.

They were playing such forward-thinking, intricate and incredible dance music, as was the way at Fabric. They always allowed new and exciting fresh talent through the doors, which paved the way for new genres of music to spread. It was a real nightclub that will truly be missed by London.

They have a legendary sound system there, which was a major part of everyone wanting to come and play. The people who came really respected the music. You turned the low end off, banged it back in, and the room went mad \u2013 it was like being at a football stadium watching a match. There was a trainspotting aspect, too, with people who know good music when they hear it: they\u2019re like little birds waiting to get fed, and they\u2019re so happy when they are \u2013 it\u2019s amazing.

A third of the room left immediately, but the front 10 rows of kids who stayed probably had their lives changed that night.

I had a residency for 15 years, on the last Friday of every month. There were times when I thought, \u2018Maybe I\u2019m not as good as I should be,\u2019 but Fabric showed faith in me. That club would be very reassuring; it was therapy. I might be having a month of self-doubt, but I\u2019d go there and do a good set, walk out and I\u2019d have cleared my head. If you were into the underground, it represented it in the best way a club could. Fabric gave every great drum\u2019n\u2019bass artist a platform: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/australia-culture-blog/2014/jun/10/australian-anthems-pendulum-tarantula\">Pendulum</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/nov/10/chase-and-status-review\">Chase &amp; Status</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/oct/30/sub-focus-nick-douwma-high-energy\">Sub Focus</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2011/sep/24/andy-c-harangue-the-dj\">Andy C</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/apr/19/frictions-favourite-tracks\">Friction</a>.

I have a signing from Brazil, guys called the Jam Thieves \u2013 they were so excited to play and they\u2019ve had their hearts broken. Ultimately, it was an underground dance club made by, and run by, people who love music \u2013 it wasn\u2019t just a business to make money. There were a lot of things they could have done to make it cheesier and lighter, but they refused. I don\u2019t believe they\u2019re going to lie down and that\u2019s the end of it \u2013 maybe they\u2019ll open a club somewhere else.

Fabric educated everyone. You didn\u2019t have to be rich and you didn\u2019t have to be smart; anyone could go to Fabric, and everyone did. The sound system was so good, that you could mix any type of record into any other type, because it sounded so strong, and so present. Hardly any sound systems are really good, and hardly any club owners understand or care about them. The owner, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/1999/sep/03/fashion\">Keith Reilly</a>, is an extremely brave, interesting, gutsy and mental man. Not many people would have the balls to go this far, to be this dedicated. He really is a fan of music, and not just a fan of clubbing and cool, annoying people. Fabric was full of people who know their craft, and know how to run a music business with the right heart and mind. Obviously there are other clubs and sound systems, but not this combination of all these parameters that came together to make the weapon Fabric is. Was.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"39a1b25760ef24581909f14c00b5557be1f03c61\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/39a1b25760ef24581909f14c00b5557be1f03c61/1021_0_3744_3744/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ben Klock\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ben Klock</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Robbie Golec</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Ben Klock</h2> <p>There\u2019s a big difference between room one and room two: both have their own identity, and I enjoyed playing them for different reasons. Room one is known for its amazing sound, and there\u2019s something ecstatic about it. It\u2019s a unique dancefloor; that\u2019s the institution, there. Room two is more raw, more techno, while room one is more for the groove. When I played back to back with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/aug/09/marcel-dettmans-favourite-tracks\">Marcel Dettmann</a> in 2014, we played 11 hours in room two, but we could have played longer, endlessly. Another time, I was super-sick with fever. Andy Blackett, the programmer, convinced me to play, but I said: \u201cYou have to take care of me.\u201d Usually, I would drink a couple of glasses of champagne to get my energy, but I couldn\u2019t do it. So they brought two litres of fresh hot ginger tea, and all these amazing fresh power-juices. In the end, playing really helped me, and I felt so much better than before. When DJs play <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/guardianwitness-blog/2014/aug/15/berlin-berghain-techno-your-stories\">Berghain</a> in Berlin for the first time, they shiver when they go on stage.

  "<p>Recent events in the Middle East and Europe seem to breathe fresh life into the \u201cclash of civilisations\u201d thesis. Western incursions into the Middle East have triggered an Islamic backlash that has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/refugees\" title=\"\">driven millions of Muslim refugees westwards</a> and inspired terrorist attacks from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/orlando-terror-attack\" title=\"\">Orlando</a> to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2016/jul/14/nice-bastille-day-france-attack-promenade-des-anglais-vehicle\" title=\"\">Nice</a>; now the EU is unravelling as European voters abandon multicultural dreams in favour of xenophobic local identities. Allegedly, this has happened because the west has chosen to ignore the deep logic of history. According to the clash of civilisations thesis, humankind has always been divided into diverse civilisations whose members view the world in different and often irreconcilable ways. These incompatible world views make conflicts between civilisations inevitable, and these conflicts in turn fuel long-term historical processes. Just as in nature different species fight for survival, so throughout history civilisations have repeatedly clashed, and only the fittest have survived. Those who overlook this grim fact do so at their peril.</p> <p>The clash of civilisations thesis has far-reaching political implications. Its supporters contend that any attempt at&#xa0;reconciliation between \u201cthe west\u201d and \u201cthe Muslim world\u201d is doomed to failure. They further maintain that the EU can work only if it renounces the multicultural fallacy in favour of an unabashed \u201cwestern\u201d identity. In the long run, only one culture can survive the unforgiving tests of natural selection, and if the EU refuses to save western civilisation from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/isis\" title=\"\">Islamic State</a> and its ilk, Britain had better <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/eu-referendum\" title=\"\">go&#xa0;it&#xa0;alone</a>.</p> <p>Though widely held, this thesis is misleading. Isis may indeed pose a radical challenge, but the \u201ccivilisation\u201d it challenges is a global civilisation rather than a uniquely western phenomenon. Not for nothing has Isis managed to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jan/16/sanctions-against-iran-to-be-lifted-after-compliance-with-nuclear-deal\" title=\"\">unite Iran with the&#xa0;United States</a>, and to create rare common ground between Israeli PM <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/binyamin-netanyahu\" title=\"\">Binyamin Netanyahu</a> and Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah. And even Isis,&#xa0;for all its medieval rhetoric, is grounded in contemporary global culture far more than in seventh-century Arabia; it caters to the fears and hopes of alienated, postmodern youth rather than to those of medieval shepherds and merchants. In pure organisational terms, Isis has more in&#xa0;common with a large corporation like Google than with <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/topic/Umayyad-dynasty-Islamic-history\" title=\"\">the Umayyad caliphate</a>. The surest sign of a real clash of civilisations is mutual incomprehension. Isis, in contrast, comprehends its enemies only too well&#xa0;\u2013 otherwise, its propaganda would not have been so effective. It is better, therefore, to see Isis as an errant offshoot of the global culture we all share, rather than as a branch of some mysterious alien tree.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Human groups may have distinct social systems, but these seldom endure for more than a few centuries</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Crucially, the analogy between history and biology that underpins the clash of civilisations thesis is false. Human groups \u2013 including human civilisations \u2013 are fundamentally different from animal species, and historical conflicts differ greatly from natural selection processes. Animal species have objective identities that endure for thousands of generations. Whether you are a chimpanzee or a&#xa0;gorilla depends on your genes rather than your beliefs, and different genes dictate diverse social behaviours. Chimpanzees live in mixed groups of&#xa0;males and females. They compete for power by building coalitions of supporters among both sexes. Among gorillas, in contrast, a single dominant male establishes a harem of females, and usually expels any adult male that might challenge his position. As far as we know, the same social systems have characterised chimpanzees and gorillas not only in recent decades, but for hundreds of thousands of years.</p> <p>You find nothing like that among humans. Yes, human groups may have distinct social systems, but these are not genetically determined, and they seldom endure for more than a few centuries. Think of 20th-century Germans, for example. In fewer than 100 years, the Germans organised themselves into six very different systems: <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/topic/Hohenzollern-dynasty\" title=\"\">the Hohenzollern empire</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weimar_Republic\" title=\"\">the&#xa0;Weimar republic</a>, the Third Reich, Communist East Germany, the federal republic of West Germany, and finally democratic reunited Germany. Of course they kept their language and love of beer. But is there some unique German essence that distinguishes their country from all other nations, and that has remained unchanged from <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilhelm_II,_German_Emperor\" title=\"\">Wilhelm II</a> to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/angela-merkel\" title=\"\">Angela Merkel</a>? And if you do come up with something, was it also there back in the&#xa0;days of Goethe, of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/jun/26/martin-luther-renegade-prophet-lyndal-roper-review\" title=\"\">Martin Luther</a> and of <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/biography/Frederick-I-Holy-Roman-emperor\" title=\"\">Frederick Barbarossa</a>?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2eed8128952a999f869a98d9827f968f10d46b85\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2eed8128952a999f869a98d9827f968f10d46b85/27_0_3155_1894/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Alex Proyas\u2019s I, Robot from 2004\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">What will happen when computers replace people in an increasing number of jobs? \u2026 Alex Proyas\u2019s <em>I, Robot</em> from 2004</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/2938272.stm\" title=\"\">Preamble of the European Constitution </a>(2004) begins by stating that it draws inspiration \u201cfrom the cultural, religious and humanist inheritance of Europe, from which have developed the universal values of&#xa0;the inviolable and inalienable rights of the human person, democracy, equality, freedom and the rule of law\u201d. This may easily give one the impression that European civilisation is defined by these values. Countless speeches and documents draw a direct line from ancient Athenian democracy to the present-day EU, celebrating 2,500 years of European freedom and democracy. This is reminiscent of the proverbial blind man taking hold of an&#xa0;elephant\u2019s tail and concluding that an elephant is a kind of brush. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athenian_democracy\" title=\"\">Athenian democracy was a half-hearted experiment</a> that survived for barely 200 years in a small corner of the Balkans. If European civilisation for the last 25 centuries has been defined by democracy and human rights, what are we to make of Sparta and Julius Caesar, the Crusaders and Conquistadores, the Inquisition and the slave trade, Louis XIV and Goebbels, Lenin and Mussolini?</p> <p>European civilisation is anything Europeans make of it, just as Christianity is anything Christians make of it. And they have made remarkably different things of it over the centuries. Human groups are defined more by the&#xa0;changes they undergo than by any continuity, but they nevertheless manage to create for themselves ancient identities thanks to their storytelling skills. No matter what revolutions they&#xa0;survive, they can weave old and new into a single yarn. Even an individual may knit revolutionary personal changes into a coherent life story: \u201cI am that person who was once a socialist, but became a capitalist; I&#xa0;was born in Senegal, and now live in France; I married, then got divorced; I&#xa0;had cancer, and then got well again.\u201d</p> <p>Similarly, a human group such as the Germans may come to define itself by the very changes it has lived through: \u201cOnce we were Nazis, but we have learned our lesson, and now we are peaceful democrats\u201d. You don\u2019t need to look for some unique German essence that manifested itself first in Hitler and then in Merkel: this radical transformation itself makes the Germans who they are.</p> <p>Isis, too, may uphold an allegedly unchanging Muslim identity, but their story of Islam is a brand new tale. Yes,&#xa0;they used some venerable Muslim texts and traditions to concoct it, but if&#xa0;I bake a cake from flour, oil and sugar that have been sitting in my pantry for&#xa0;the past two months, does it mean the cake itself is two months old? Conversely, those who dismiss Isis as \u201cun-Islamic\u201d or even \u201canti-Islamic\u201d are equally mistaken: Islam has no DNA. Just as with Christianity, Islam is whatever Muslims make of it.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f5d2110b0b2cbddd6ba6d6f9c5ab061675aee20f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f5d2110b0b2cbddd6ba6d6f9c5ab061675aee20f/21_0_4113_2468/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Palmyra\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Isis wrecked the ancient site of Palmyra in Syria.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Valery Sharifulin/Tass</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Yet there is an even deeper difference distinguishing human groups from animal species. Species often split, but never merge. About seven million years ago, chimpanzees and gorillas had common ancestors. This single ancestral species split into two populations that eventually went their separate, evolutionary ways. Once this happened, there was no going back. Since individuals belonging to different species cannot produce fertile offspring together, species can never merge. Gorillas can\u2019t merge with chimpanzees, giraffes can\u2019t merge with elephants, and dogs can\u2019t merge with cats.</p> <p>Human tribes, in contrast, tend to coalesce over time into larger and larger groups. Modern Germans were created from the merger of Saxons, Prussians, Swabians and Bavarians, which not so long ago wasted little love on one another.<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/nov/10/on-the-origin-of-species-voted-most-influential-academic-book-charles-darwin\" title=\"\"><em> </em></a>The French were created from&#xa0;the merger of Franks, Normans, Bretons, Gascons and Provencals. Meanwhile across the Channel, English, Scots, Welsh and Irish gradually came together (willingly or not) to form Britons. In the not too distant future, Germans, French and Britons might yet&#xa0;merge into Europeans.</p> <p>Mergers don\u2019t always last, as people in London, Edinburgh and Brussels are well aware these days. Brexit may&#xa0;well initiate the simultaneous unravelling of both the EU and the UK. But in the long run, history\u2019s direction is clear-cut. Ten thousand years ago humankind was divided into countless isolated tribes. With each passing millennium, these merged into larger and larger groups, creating fewer and&#xa0;fewer distinct civilisations. In recent generations the few remaining civilisations have been merging into a&#xa0;single global community. Political and ethnic divisions endure, but they do not undermine the fundamental unity. Indeed, some divisions are made possible only by an over-arching common structure.</p> <p>***</p> <p>The process of human unification has&#xa0;taken two distinct forms: weak heterogeneous unification and strong homogeneous unification. The weaker heterogeneous form involves creating ties between previously unrelated groups. The groups may continue to have different beliefs and practices, but are no longer independent of each other. From this perspective, even war&#xa0;is a bond \u2013 perhaps the strongest bond of all. Ten thousand years ago, no&#xa0;tribe in America had any quarrel with Middle Eastern enemies, and no African clan bore grudges towards any European. In contrast, during the second world war, people born on the shores of the Mississippi went to their deaths on Pacific islands and European meadows, while recruits from the heart of Africa fell fighting among French vineyards and Alpine snows.</p> <p>Historians often argue that globalisation reached a first peak in 1913, then went into a long decline during the era of the world wars and the cold war, and recuperated only after 1989. They fear that new conflicts may again put globalisation into reverse gear. This may be true of economic globalisation, but it ignores the different but equally important dynamics of military globalisation. War spreads ideas, technologies and people far more quickly than commerce. War also makes people far more interested in one another.<strong> </strong>Never had the US been more closely in touch with Russia than during the cold war, when every cough in a Moscow corridor sent&#xa0;people scrambling up and down Washington staircases. People care far more about their enemies than about their trade partners. For every US film about Thailand, there are probably 20 about Vietnam. The global \u201cwar on terror\u201d simply continues the process of&#xa0;military globalisation.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b6166d8782835abdc7f8685fa59fe38acd936bda\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b6166d8782835abdc7f8685fa59fe38acd936bda/0_0_2200_1467/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A Bitcoin (virtual currency) paper wallet with QR codes and a coin are seen at La Maison du Bitcoin in Paris\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Nowadays, the global unity of conflict is perhaps most apparent on the internet, where Isis and the drug cartels are rubbing shoulders with Google and Facebook, and YouTube offers funny cat videos alongside instructions on how to make bombs. Islamic fanatics, murderous drug dealers and geeky hackers don\u2019t exist on unrelated planets; they share the same global cyberspace. All are thrilled&#xa0;by the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/07/blockchain-answer-life-universe-everything-bitcoin-technology\" title=\"\">blockchain technology</a> that gave us the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/bitcoin\" title=\"\">bitcoin</a>; all count on easy accessibility via ubiquitous smartphones, and all are antagonised by national governments attempting to wrest control of the net.</p> <p>Yet the world of the early 21st century has gone way beyond the heterogeneous unity of conflict. People across the globe are not only influenced by one another, they increasingly share identical beliefs and practices. A thousand years ago, planet Earth was home to dozens of different political models. In Europe you could find feudal principalities vying with independent city states and minuscule theocracies. The&#xa0;Muslim world had its caliphate, claiming universal sovereignty, but also experimented with kingdoms, emirates and sultanates. The Chinese empire believed itself to be the sole legitimate political entity, while to its north and west tribal confederacies fought each other with glee. India and south-east Asia contained a kaleidoscope of regimes, whereas polities in America, Africa and Australasia ranged from tiny hunter-gatherer bands to sprawling empires. No wonder even neighbouring human groups had trouble agreeing on diplomatic practices, not to mention international laws. Each society had its own political paradigms, and found it difficult to understand \u2013 let alone respect \u2013 alien political concepts.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Today there are nearly 200 sovereign states, which generally agree on diplomatic protocols and common international laws</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Today, in contrast, a single political paradigm is accepted everywhere. The planet is divided between nearly 200 sovereign states, which generally agree on the same diplomatic protocols and on common international laws. Sweden, Nigeria, Papua New Guinea and Paraguay are all marked on our world maps as the same kind of colourful shapes; they are all members of the UN; and despite myriad differences they are all recognised as sovereign states enjoying similar rights and privileges. Indeed, they share many more political ideas and practices, including at least a token belief in representative bodies, universal suffrage and human rights. When Israelis and Palestinians, Russians and Ukrainians, or Kurds and&#xa0;Turks court global public opinion, they all use the same discourse of human rights, state sovereignty and international law.</p> <p>The world may be peppered with various types of \u201cfailed states\u201d, but it knows only one paradigm for a successful state. Global politics follows \u201cthe Anna Karenina principle\u201d: healthy states are all alike, but every failed state fails in its own way, by missing this or that ingredient of the dominant political package. Isis stands out in its complete rejection of this package, and its attempt to establish an&#xa0;entirely different kind of political entity \u2013 a universal caliphate. But it is unlikely to succeed precisely for this reason. Numerous guerrilla forces and terror organisations have managed to establish new countries or conquer existing ones, but they have always done so by accepting the fundamental principles of the global political order. Even <a href=\"http://www.un.org/press/en/1997/19970415.sc6357.html\" title=\"\">the Taliban sought international recognition as the legitimate government</a> of the sovereign country of Afghanistan. No group rejecting the principles of global politics has so far&#xa0;gained lasting control of a significant territory.</p> <p>***</p> <p>In pre-modern times, humans experimented not only with diverse political blueprints, but with a mind-boggling variety of economic models. Russian <em>boyars</em>, Hindu maharajas, Chinese mandarins and Amerindian tribal chiefs had very different ideas about money and taxation, and none was even aware of the existence of such a&#xa0;thing as \u201cthe economy\u201d. Nowadays, in contrast, almost everybody believes in slightly different variations on the same capitalist theme, and we are all cogs within a single global production line. Whether you live in Mongolia, New Zealand or Bolivia, your daily routines and economic fortunes depend on the same economic theories, the same corporations and banks, and the same currents of capital. When finance ministers or bank managers from China, Russia, Brazil and India meet, they have a common language, and can&#xa0;easily understand and sympathise with their counterparts\u2019 woes.</p> <p>When Isis conquered large parts of Syria and Iraq, it murdered tens of thousands of people, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/aug/21/islamic-state-destroyed-ancient-saint-eliane-monastery-syria-says-priest\" title=\"\">demolished archaeological sites</a>, toppled statues and systematically destroyed the symbols of previous regimes and of western cultural influence. Yet when Isis fighters entered the banks and found stashes of US dollars covered with the faces of American presidents and English slogans praising American political and religious ideals, they did not burn these dollars. For the dollar bill is universally venerated across all political and religious divides. Though it has no intrinsic value \u2013 you cannot eat or drink a dollar bill \u2013 trust in the dollar and in the wisdom of the Federal Reserve is so firm it is shared even by Islamic fundamentalists, Mexican drug lords and North Korean tyrants.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"97eb1359d21a3bf9bfaf6a009db19569faae78b1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/97eb1359d21a3bf9bfaf6a009db19569faae78b1/0_0_5760_3840/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Doctors all over the word will dispense similar medicines made by the same drug companies\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Doctors all over the word will dispense similar medicines made by the same drug companies</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy Stock Photo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Yet the homogeneity of contemporary humanity is most apparent when it comes to our view of the natural world and of the human body. If you fell sick in 1016, it mattered a great deal where you lived. In Europe, the resident priest would probably tell you&#xa0;that you&#xa0;had made God angry, and&#xa0;that in order to regain your health, you should donate something to the church, make a pilgrimage to a sacred site, and pray&#xa0;fervently for God\u2019s forgiveness. Alternatively, the village witch might explain that a demon had possessed you, and that she could cast the demon&#xa0;out using song, dance and the&#xa0;blood of a black cockerel. In the Middle East, doctors brought up on classical traditions might explain that your <a href=\"http://www.sciencemuseum.org.uk/broughttolife/techniques/humours\" title=\"\">four bodily humours</a> were out of&#xa0;balance, and you could harmonise them anew with a proper diet and foul-smelling potions. In India, Ayurvedic experts would offer their own theories concerning the balance between the&#xa0;three bodily elements known as <em>doshas</em>, and recommend a treatment of&#xa0;herbs, massages and exercises. Chinese physicians, Siberian shamans, African witch doctors, Amerindian medicine men \u2013 every empire, kingdom and tribe had its own traditions and experts, each espousing different views about the human body and the nature of sickness, and each offering its own cornucopia of rituals, concoctions and&#xa0;cures. Some of them worked surprisingly well; others were little short of&#xa0;a death sentence. The one thing that&#xa0;united European, Chinese, African and American medical conditions was that everywhere at least a third of people died before adulthood, and nowhere did average life expectancy exceed 40.</p> <p>Today, if you are taken ill, it makes far less difference where you live. In Toronto, Tokyo, Tehran or Tel Aviv, you will be taken to similar-looking hospitals, where you will meet doctors who learned the same scientific theories in not-too-different medical colleges. They will follow identical protocols and use identical tests to reach very similar diagnoses. They will then dispense similar medicines made by the same drug companies. There are still some minor cultural differences, but Canadian, Japanese, Iranian and Israeli physicians hold much the same views about the human body and human diseases. After <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/dec/09/life-under-isis-raqqa-mosul-giant-prison-syria-iraq\" title=\"\">Isis captured Raqqa and Mosul</a>, it did not tear down the hospitals; rather, it launched an appeal to Muslim doctors and nurses throughout the world to volunteer their services there. Presumably, even Isis doctors and nurses believe that the body is made of cells, that diseases are caused by pathogens, and that antibiotics kill bacteria.</p> <p>And what makes up these cells and bacteria? Indeed, what makes up the entire world? Back in 1016, every culture had its own story about the universe, and about the fundamental ingredients of the cosmic soup. Today, learned people throughout the world believe exactly the same things about matter, energy, time and space. Take, for example, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/irans-nuclear-programme\" title=\"\">Iran\u2019s nuclear programme</a>. The whole problem with it is that the Iranians have exactly the same view of physics as the Israelis and Americans. If the Iranians believed that E=mc\u2074, Israel would not care an iota about their nuclear programme.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Churchill wasn\u2019t more western than Hitler; their struggle defined what it meant to be western at that moment in history</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>People still claim to believe in different things. But when it comes to&#xa0;the really important stuff \u2013 how to build a state, an economy, a hospital, or a weapon \u2013 almost all of us belong to&#xa0;the same civilisation. There are disagreements, no doubt, but then all&#xa0;civilisations have their internal disagreements \u2013 indeed, they are defined by these disagreements. When&#xa0;trying to outline their identity, people often make a grocery list of common traits. They would fare much better if they made a list of common conflicts and dilemmas instead. In 1940, Britain and&#xa0;Germany had very different traits, yet they were both part and parcel of \u201cwestern civilisation\u201d. Churchill wasn\u2019t more western than Hitler; rather, the struggle between them defined what it meant to be western at that particular moment in history. In contrast, a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C7%83Kung_people\" title=\"\">!Kung</a> hunter-gatherer in 1940 wasn\u2019t western, because the internal western clash about race and empire would have made little sense to him.</p> <p>The people we fight most often are our own family members. Identity is defined by conflicts and dilemmas more than by agreements. What does it mean to be European in 2016? It doesn\u2019t mean to have white skin, to believe in&#xa0;Jesus Christ, or to uphold liberty. Rather, it means to argue vehemently about immigration, about the EU, and about the limits of capitalism. It also means to obsessively ask yourself \u201cWhat defines my identity?\u201d and to worry about an ageing population, about rampant consumerism and about global warming without really knowing what to do about it. In their conflicts and dilemmas, 21st-century Europeans are very different from their early-modern and medieval ancestors, but are increasingly similar to their Chinese and Indian contemporaries.</p> <p>Whatever changes await us, they are&#xa0;likely to involve a fraternal struggle within a single civilisation rather than a clash between alien civilisations. The&#xa0;big challenges of the 21st century will be global in nature. What will happen when pollution triggers global climate changes? What will happen when computers replace people in an&#xa0;increasing number of jobs? When biotechnology enables us to upgrade humans, extend lifespans, and perhaps split humankind into different biological castes? No doubt, we will have huge arguments and bitter conflicts over these questions. But these arguments and conflicts are unlikely to drive us apart. Just the opposite. They will make us ever more interdependent, as members of a single, rowdy, global civilisation.</p> <p>\u2022 Yuval Noah Harari\u2019s <a href=\"http://bookshop.theguardian.com/homo-deus.html?utm_source=editoriallink&amp;utm_medium=merch&amp;utm_campaign=article\" title=\"\"><em>Homo Deus: A Brief History of Tomorrow</em></a> is published by Harvill Secker. <a href=\"http://www.ynharari.com/\" title=\"\">ynharari.com</a></p>",

  "<p>A few years ago, journalist <a href=\"http://hazlitt.net/longreads/rise-femoir\">Kaitlin Fontana</a> wrote about the rise of a literary genre she dubbed \u201cthe Femoir\u201d. Femoirs, she wrote, are \u201cmemoirs written by female comedians \u2026 propelling their authors from acts to brands\u201d. And not even memoirs, really, but a collection of confessional essays loosely strung together on a self-help string. As this was 2012, Fontana was referring to Tina Fey\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2011/apr/24/bossypants-tina-fey-review-30-rock\"><em>Bossypants</em></a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2006/feb/12/features.woman\">Chelsea Handler</a>\u2019s <em>My Horizontal Life</em>, Sarah Silverman\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2010/aug/22/sarah-silverman-bedwetter-book-review\"><em>The Bedwetter</em></a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2011/nov/08/mindy-kaling-girly-things\">Mindy Kaling</a>\u2019s <em>Is Everyone Hanging Out Without Me?</em>, all of which were smart, funny and deservedly bestsellers.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2016/sep/04/amy-schumer-edinburgh-playhouse-review\">Amy Schumer review \u2013 superstar with sex on the brain</a> </p> </aside>  <p>If Fontana\u2019s term seemed niche then, it feels ubiquitous now. Since 2012, there have been femoirs from pretty much every high-profile American female comedian under 50, and with repetition the format has calcified. Whereas a memoir will underline its subject\u2019s uniqueness, the femoir intimates that the author is just like the reader. It will include anecdotes about how the writer is insecure but also, like, really strong, and there will be a continual emphasis on how the writer is fallible but simultaneously inspirational.</p> <p>The limitations of the femoir reveal how narrow the parameters still are for women in the public eye, who are expected to be exceptional but also an everywoman. These books are invariably pitched as feminist statements; because the bar is still so low, it is apparently a triumph of equality when a woman admits to enjoying sex. But there is a fine line between a woman feeling able to say something and feeling obliged to do so for her brand.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The bar is still so low, it is apparently a triumph of equality when a woman admits to enjoying sex</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p><em>The Girl With the Lower Back Tattoo</em> is the femoir from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/amy-schumer\">Amy Schumer</a>, one of the highest profile comedians in the world right now. Schumer has an interesting story to tell: she was born into a family of privilege, but her parents lost all their money when she was a child; she went from taking private jets to the Bahamas to sharing a bed with her mother in a basement flat. At the same time, her father developed MS and her parents\u2019 marriage collapsed after her mother had an affair with the father of Schumer\u2019s best friend. Schumer started doing standup in her early 20s and, within a decade, had achieved huge success.</p> <p><em>The Girl With the Lower Back Tattoo</em> is not, she writes, a memoir: \u201cI just turned 35, so I have a long way to go until I am memoir-worthy.\u201d But considering she discusses everything from her hatred of watercress to her bowel movements before a show, it\u2019s hard to imagine what else she could include in an autobiography. Presumably she would feel less obliged to include such typically femoir-esque \u201cyou go girl!\u201d sentences as, \u201cI feel beautiful and strong\u201d (which contradict less cliched lines such as, \u201cI sometimes forget a man may have actual feelings for me\u201d). Nor would she need to soften her edges.</p> <p>Schumer is at an awkward point in her career now, transitioning out of the dumb white woman stage persona she created over the last decade \u2013 when she\u2019d say such things as \u201cI used to date Hispanic guys, but now I prefer consensual\u201d \u2013 and trying to become more palatable to the mainstream. This is apparent throughout her book; for example, she will compare an elderly African American woman to \u201ca California raisin\u201d, then to add hastily: \u201cThat is not racist. If she\u2019d been white, she would have looked like a yellow California raisin. Anywhoozle \u2026\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Alongside the vogue for women to reveal their personal lives is another which excoriates them for revealing too much</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Early in the book she jokes, \u201cDamn, it\u2019s hard to write a book and not get yelled at\u201d, and that is certainly true. While the rise of the femoir reflects the current vogue for women to reveal their personal lives in public, alongside this trend is another in which women are excoriated for revealing too much of the wrong stuff. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/sep/30/not-that-kind-of-girl-lena-dunham-review-memoir\">Lena Dunham</a> fell victim to this after the 2014 publication of her femoir, <em>Not That Kind of Girl</em>, when she was accused, absurdly, of being a sexual abuser after writing about the time she realised her baby sister had shoved some pebbles into her own vagina. (Gynecological narcissism is another common element of the femoir: Dunham discusses her vagina at least two dozen times in her book; Schumer kicks off hers with \u201cAn Open Letter to My Vagina\u201d.)</p> <p>In a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2016/aug/27/amy-schumer-not-trying-be-likable\">recent Guardian interview</a>, Schumer insisted: \u201cI\u2019m not trying to be likable.\u201d You would not guess that from her book, in which she claims the only change her new riches have made to her life is she gives bigger tips. I\u2019d have been a lot more interested to read how it felt when she negotiated her book advance from $1m to $8m, but that would perhaps have strayed too far outside the femoir\u2019s approachable everywoman bounds.</p> <p>In trying to be so likable, Schumer seems dishonest. The only essays that ring true are those about her family, in particular the one in which she describes how it felt to watch her increasingly sick father lose control of his bowels in an airport and, later, how furious she still is with her mother for having had an affair 20 years ago. I subscribe to the school of Nora Ephron \u2013 arguably the mother of the femoir \u2013 which says the statute of limitations for being mad at your parents for ruining your childhood is up when you leave home. But you can\u2019t tell a woman to reveal her feelings and then damn her for having the wrong kind.</p> <p>As you\u2019d expect of a comedian of Schumer\u2019s calibre, the writing captures her voice and is often funny. But this book proves the theory that the larger a book\u2019s advance, the less editing it gets. I went to see Schumer\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2016/aug/31/amy-schumer-review-edinburgh-playhouse\">live tour</a> while reading this book and, although she relates many of the same stories on stage, the contrast between the two experiences underlined the reductive nature of the femoir. On stage, she dealt with the subject of inane women\u2019s magazines in a brisk, amusing five minutes. Here, she spends 10 stodgy pages on the subject, making heavy weather of their effect on women\u2019s self-esteem and saying nothing new. It feels like Schumer is fighting the genre, insisting she has \u201cno self-help or advice for you\u201d, only to claim later, \u201cI am all of you\u201d.</p> <p>The femoir was meant to celebrate original female voices, but it has ended up smoothing down their spikiness. Far from showcasing funny women, it grinds them down into feminism lite.</p> <p>\u2022 To order <em>The Girl With the Lower Back Tattoo</em> for \u00a316.40 (HarperCollins, RRP \u00a320), go to <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/girl-with-the-lower-back-tattoo.html?utm_source=editoriallink&amp;utm_medium=merch&amp;utm_campaign=article\">bookshop.theguardian.com</a> or call 0330 333 6846.

  "<h2>Four months and counting</h2> <p>China and the US\u2019s announcement <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/sep/03/breakthrough-us-china-agree-ratify-paris-climate-change-deal\">that they will join the Paris climate accord</a> comes at a time when the UK\u2019s own climate and energy policies appear at best in disarray, and worst at odds.<br></p> <p>Imagine you\u2019re stuck in a burning building. Stay and you perish, but the complexity of the building means that to physically escape you have to work with the others also trapped. If everyone does their own thing, many valiant efforts will be made, but ultimately you\u2019ll all be doomed.</p> <p>Tackling climate change is fundamentally a challenge of first accepting that action sufficient to prevent irreversible warming is non-negotiable \u2013 you need to get out of the burning building \u2013 and then of solidarity and cooperation, you need to make the escape plan happen together.</p> <p>In the UK only the Green party has climate targets roughly in line with what climate science says is needed. Meanwhile, solidarity and cooperation within parties is proving hard enough to achieve after the vote for the UK to leave the EU, let alone presenting the electorate with an undivided progressive choice in elections. </p> <p>Post-Brexit we can expect little of the UK government on sufficient and clear climate action. The great irony of the lobby to leave, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/may/30/brexit-spirit-crushing-green-directives-minister-george-eustice\">which railed against the \u201cred tape\u201d of Brussels</a>, is that it has triggered probably Britain\u2019s biggest ever open-ended, bureaucratic exercise. Forty years\u2019 worth of legislation and cross-border agreements need rewriting in a more complicated, multipolar world. Not only will this distract, decisively, from achieving much else, but international treaty negotiation will be dictated by the old economics of competition and division.</p> <p>Fortunately, new alliances in the UK are being explored to reverse inequality and live within the Earth\u2019s limits.</p> <p>Caroline Lucas has joined with Lisa Nandy, Labour\u2019s former shadow spokesperson on energy and climate change, and Liberal Democrats including the current leader, Tim Farron, to launch an initiative for greater direct political cooperation, called for in a new book, <a href=\"https://www.bitebackpublishing.com/books/the-alternative\">The Alternative: Towards a New Progressive Politics</a>. The title echoes the name of the mould breaking new political party in Denmark of the same name, <a href=\"http://alternativet.dk/english/\">The Alternative</a>, set up in 2013 to be a fresh, collaborative and progressive voice and change the divisive tone of domestic politics. </p> <p>Writing in the book, Uffe Elb\u00e6k, its party leader, compares the emergence of The Alternative to Syriza and Podemos as a reaction to a failure of the political system so serious that it leaves democracy itself under threat. But, far from strident, their response is to advocate for new, shared values that are the inverse of the emergent chest-beating and fearful nationalism threatening international cooperation on everything, including climate change. They speak instead of political mobilisation based on humility, empathy, courage, generosity and even humour.</p> <p>The scope and ambition of contributors to the UK initiative addresses the appetite and mechanics for cooperation.</p> <p>In a chapter on re-imagining Britain\u2019s approach to the environment, I argue in the book that from government to anti-austerity groups in opposition, there is a kind of denial about the full economic implications of preventing irreversible climatic upheaval. The clamour for a return to growth inevitably results in a kind of business as usual consumerism.</p> <p>In terms of alternative economic visions among progressive circles, if any are discernible they tend toward the vague promise of <a href=\"https://libcom.org/blog/fully-automated-luxury-communism-utopian-critique-14062015\">\u201cfully automated luxury communism\u201d </a>- a world in which technology and redistribution deliver lives of leisure and plenty. </p> <p>But not only does this founder on broken planetary, environmental boundaries, it also contains a kind of impoverished digital disengagement with the real, material world. The alternative is a green, circular and genuinely shared economy of \u201cbetter not more\u201d. In this, reskilled and reconnected, rather than passive, disposable consumerism, we take back more control of our lives making, mending, re-using and sharing more of the things we need. </p> <p>Not only does this bring greater independence, wellbeing, cost and resource savings, but it draws on long-standing working class traditions of self and mutual help that let people and communities flourish in tough economic times. The cultivation of new skills and craft also counter the alienation of much modern work. </p> <p>A new more plural, progressive politics, capable of supporting the changes needed to prevent climate disaster, itself needs a new economic model, judged not by how quickly it grows, but by how well it allows us all to thrive within planetary environmental boundaries.</p>",
  "<p>In March 2003 the best part of 10 million people tuned in to watch Adam, Pete, Jenny, David and Karen scatter Rachel\u2019s ashes in Portmeirion before scattering themselves to TV history. After five series of Cold Feet, writer Mike Bullen had decided enough was enough. Having spent the best part of six years living with his characters, he wanted to end on a high rather than risk going a series too far. As if to underline there really was to be no going back, Bullen and his family upped sticks and emigrated to Australia on the day the final series started filming.</p> <p>Over the years, the bosses at ITV would periodically check with Bullen to see if he had changed his mind but the answer was always the same: \u201cnothing doing\u201d. Until last year. So what changed his mind? Was he bullied into submission, offered irresistible sums of money or just fed up at having everything he had written subsequently being always compared to Cold Feet?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"98353dd0d554e5646a9ff83cfbbbf90ed48b4998\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/98353dd0d554e5646a9ff83cfbbbf90ed48b4998/31_0_1382_1728/800.jpg\" alt=\"The cast of Cold Feet in 1999.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The cast of Cold Feet in 1999: Helen Baxendale, Robert Bathurst, Hermione Norris, John Thomson, Fay Ripley and James Nesbitt</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: ITV/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Bullen laughs down the phone from his home just north of Sydney. \u201cNone of the above,\u201d he says. \u201cWhat changed was that I felt I had something new to say. The Cold Feet characters had always been at the same stage in life as me and I was consumed with the bringing up of the kids, and I had nothing to say about that. It was just hard work. What interests me are life\u2019s tipping points.</p> <p>\u201cIn the first five series, the characters were trying to find their place in life. They were building careers, looking for partners and wondering whether to have kids. Once you\u2019ve done all that, you\u2019re basically stuck in the hard grind of making it all work. Then comes the moment that I\u2019ve reached now, when your career is as sorted as it\u2019s ever going to be, your kids are basically grown up and you\u2019re faced with thinking what the hell you are going to do with the rest of your life.

The whole point about grown-up kids is that they have almost no interest in what their parents are doing, so I wanted their presence in the scripts to be mainly texture rather than structure.\u201d</p> <p>In other words, pretty much business as usual. There\u2019s always a danger in revisiting old friends \u2013 there\u2019s often a very good reason why you haven\u2019t seen someone for a while \u2013 and Bullen knows there will be some viewers who would rather their memories of Cold Feet had been left undisturbed and won\u2019t be happy at the show resurfacing. But for most of us, there is a real excitement in hooking up with Adam and co after such a long absence. Partly because the shows were invariably well-written \u2013 the comedy often came with a real edge and even in its soppiest moments never lapsed into sentimental schlock \u2013 but mainly because the characters themselves were always such good company.</p> <p>Adam was everyone\u2019s favourite nightmare \u2013 great in small doses but a disaster to live with; Pete and Jenny were razor sharp, seldom giving an inch; while Karen and David were the forgivable face of mindless aspiration. Everyone of a certain age had friends like them. They were as recognisable to British audiences as the cast of Thirty Something were to Americans. So who could resist seeing the Thirty Somethings turn into every-bit-as-complicated Fifty Somethings? Theirs is the generation that was never going to go gently into late middle-age as their parents had done before them. Theirs was the generation that would go down kicking and screaming to the end, still wondering how to grow up even as they contemplate their own mortality. Bring it on.

The human right to water, says Eliasson, is a \u201chistoric, noble, even sacred, mission and cause\u201d.</p> <p>He reels off the statistics to show how far there is yet to go: \u201c<a href=\"http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs391/en/\">1.8 billion people worldwide</a> drink contaminated water; <a href=\"http://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/water-and-sanitation/\">2.4 billion people lack improved sanitation</a>.

The development and climate agendas are mutually reinforcing and one cannot be be achieved without the other,\u201d he says. <br></p> <p>\u201cAwareness of climate change helped the SDG process. They reinforce each other.\u201d </p> <p>As the first head of humanitarian affairs, Eliasson led UN missions to Somalia, Sudan, Mozambique and Nagorno-Karabakh, and saw for himself how water is used as a weapon of conflict. In Darfur, he saw dead dogs thrown down wells to clear villages. \u201cIn Iraq, I learned how extremist groups exploit access to water to expand control over territory,\u201d Eliasson recalls.</p> <p>He fears that in an age of climate change, population growth and the burgeoning of cities, access to water will become a factor in more disputes. \u201cAll over the world, water scarcity can become a reason for conflict. Droughts are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/sep/21/this-growing-migration-crisis-canary-mine-climate-change-middle-east\">driving people from the countryside to cities</a>, increasing pressures on water, which can lead to instability.

She wasn\u2019t responding to a hot issue in British politics. She wasn\u2019t jumping aboard a populist or media bandwagon. Few in her party cared about these issues at all. In almost every serious respect the issues were as dead as dodos in British politics.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/nils-pratley-on-finance/2016/jul/11/theresa-may-plan-workers-boardroom-reform-extraordinary-tories\">Theresa May's plan to put workers in boardrooms is extraordinary</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Dust had gathered on terms such as industrial strategy and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jul/11/the-guardian-view-on-theresa-may-as-pm-triumph-of-a-known-unknown\">workplace co-determination</a> ever since Margaret Thatcher entered Downing Street in 1979. Britain fought hard throughout the 1980s to thwart attempts to develop European company law. Yet here, suddenly and paradoxically, was a senior Tory politician, in the wake of the EU referendum, talking about the strategic failures of British management, and the case for employees and customers to sit on company boards, in ways that raised distinct European echoes.</p> <p>Corporate governance and industrial democracy have been the neglected Cinderellas of British politics and economic thinking for decades. May has shaken that all up with a <a href=\"http://www.ukpol.co.uk/2016/07/11/theresa-may-2016-speech-to-launch-leadership-campaign/\">single speech</a>. Suddenly, the ideas she floated in her brief leadership campaign are part of the mainstream political agenda. You could almost say they have become fashionable \u2013 if <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/sep/06/sports-direct-to-ditch-zero-hours-contracts\">an endorsement by Mike Ashley of Sports Direct</a> this week for a worker to sit on his board can be dignified in such a way.</p> <p>The larger question is where this might all be heading. The answer, as with other parts of the May project, is that we don\u2019t yet know. This autumn, business secretary Greg Clark is expected to produce a consultative paper, the first real test of government thinking. Lobbyists will already be hard at work trying to dilute the options. But that\u2019s not a reason for not taking the subjects seriously. And with the TUC congress starting in Brighton next week, the labour movement should engage intelligently too.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>British companies have too often been run by people who think management know best and that employees know nothing</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>For decades, after all, British companies have too often been run by people, such as Ashley, who think management always knows best, and that employees know nothing and are essentially expendable. The idea that industrial democracy might have something positive to offer British business has effectively been sidelined since James Callaghan\u2019s Labour government shelved the <a href=\"http://www.historyandpolicy.org/trade-union-forum/meeting/democracy-in-the-workplace-the-bullock-report-revisited\">Bullock report</a> in 1977. Such thinking has been routinely dismissed as out-of-date corporatist nonsense or red tape.</p> <p>The unions haven\u2019t always been much better. Hugh Scanlon of the engineering workers\u2019 union, one of the infamous barons of the 1970s, once said he supported management\u2019s right to manage and the unions\u2019 right to stop them doing it. Jack Jones, the transport workers\u2019 leader, took a different view. Jones was always genuinely interested in what used to be called workers\u2019 control \u2013 that\u2019s another phrase you don\u2019t hear much these days \u2013 and sat on the Bullock committee, which recommended \u201ca real, and not a sham or a token share\u201d for employees in company management.</p> <p>British capitalism has been transformed in other ways since those days, of course. Heavy industries have gone to the wall. Service industries now occupy the lion\u2019s share of economic activity. The unions are far less powerful. The nature of work continues to be transformed by women\u2019s employment, part-time and temporary contracts, changes to retirement, home-working and new technology.</p> <p>But industrial cooperation remains a very meaningful principle nonetheless. Last month I went with the TUC\u2019s Frances O\u2019Grady to BMW\u2019s Cowley car works in Oxfordshire and talked to management and workforce representatives. German co-determination rights don\u2019t apply to those working for German companies in other countries. But German management culture does, and the impact is revelatory, in Cowley at least.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ec3a1fbdf8b681d8554f2f824dd4aa7db7a00c0a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ec3a1fbdf8b681d8554f2f824dd4aa7db7a00c0a/0_0_6144_3686/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Frances O\u2019Grady, centre, visiting the Cowley factory.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Frances O\u2019Grady, centre, visiting the Cowley factory.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jess Hurd</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Chris Bond, a senior Unite shop steward, sits on the global works council with BMW and gets plenty of advance notice of company thinking. Longterm strategy, research and development, and workforce training and education are tangible results, he believes. \u201cOn the basis of experience,\u201d he says, \u201cI would far rather be managed by a German manager than a British manager. The British ignore what you say to them. The Germans take it seriously and act on it. When this plant was run by a bloke called Andy I never met him. But Gunther has an open door.\u201d</p> <p>There are lots of reasons why Cowley hasn\u2019t had an industrial dispute since the British Leyland days in, appropriately, 1984. They include fear that the owners would simply take the jobs overseas, tighter industrial relations laws, economic downturns that mean workers don\u2019t want to take risks and, not least, the fact that BMW has invested in the plant so that Cowley is now producing a successful product, in the shape of the latest iterations of the ever-popular Mini.</p> <p>But you can\u2019t talk to either management or workers at Cowley without seeing that corporate culture is a big part of the reason too.

  "<h2><strong>BBC Proms 2016: Verdi Requiem </strong><br>7.30pm, BBC4</h2> <p>Anyone who doesn\u2019t already know about the screaming heavy metal that is the Dies Irae section of this Proms staple would be well advised to check it out. Scholars who knew about it before hearing it on film trailers can learn more from a chat with conductor Marin Alsop. The Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment perform with the BBC Proms Youth Choir and soloists Tamara Wilson, Alisa Kolosova, Michael Fabiano and Morris Robinson. <em>John Robinson</em></p> <h2>Countrywise: Guide to Britain <br>8pm, ITV</h2> <p>This gentle series is ITV\u2019s answer to Countryfile \u2013 and a decent answer it is, too, featuring bucolic scenes held together by Ben Fogle\u2019s inimitable, plummy charm. As it begins a new spinoff, he\u2019s on the Isles of Scilly, presenting what is effectively a tourism advert for this verdant, virtually crime-free corner of Britain. Elsewhere, Liz Bonnin explores Dorset\u2019s Jurassic coast and Victoria Pendleton gets horsey at Holkham Sands in Norfolk. <em>Hannah J Davies</em></p> <h2><strong>Would I Lie to You? </strong><br>8.30pm, BBC1</h2> <p>The Rob Brydon-helmed panel show is on its 10th series now, and it has endured for a reason: it\u2019s reliably good \u2013 albeit formulaic \u2013 fun, thanks to the counterintuitive chemistry of David Mitchell and Lee Mack, plus the well-chosen guests. Tonight\u2019s episode features the irascible Michael Smiley, the mordant Diane Morgan, the always\u2011inspired Bob Mortimer (look out for a marvellous riff on early 1980s haircuts) and the game, but mildly bewildered, Nadiya Hussain. <em>Phil Harrison</em></p> <h2><strong>We Love Sitcom </strong><br>9pm, BBC1</h2> <p>With the Beeb currently, and in some cases ill\u2011advisedly, reworking classic sitcoms, here\u2019s a tie-in quiz show hosted by Ben Miller in which celebrity funny folk test their knowledge of the genre that made them famous. Jennifer Saunders, Stephen Mangan, Jessica Hynes and Lee Mack are among the contestants. As Pointless fans will attest, however, celebrities are useless at quizzes \u2013 none of the luminaries get the Reg Varney question, an old pub quiz chestnut. <em>David Stubbs</em></p> <h2><strong>Joanna Lumley\u2019s Japan </strong><br>9pm, ITV</h2> <p>Silky of voice and enthusiastic of spirit, Joanna Lumley is the perfect tour guide as she travels 2,000 miles across Japan. This week, she\u2019s in the northern island of Hokkaido before heading to Sapporo, where the annual snow festival is in full swing. She charms the locals, talks to monkeys and hugs an ice sculpture. However, one of the most poignant moments comes when she meets a man who stayed in Fukushima, the site of the devastated nuclear power plant, to look after pets. <em>Hannah Verdier</em></p> <h2>The Strain <br>9pm, W</h2> <p>Series three of the horror drama co-created by Guillermo del Toro. The strigoi, a vampire herd created during an epic underworld disagreement, are rampant in New York and evolving into smarter predators \u2013 another bad day for alcoholic epidemiologist Eph (Corey Stoll) and pest exterminator Fet (Kevin Durand), humanity\u2019s best hopes.

The roasters lining up to launch near-the-knuckle putdowns at the handsome actor who practically invented the sex tape include David Spade, former Karate Kid Ralph Macchio, quarterback Peyton Manning, Bo Derek and \u2013 perhaps weirdest of all \u2013 our own Jimmy Carr. <em>Graeme Virtue</em></p> <h2>Film choice</h2> <p><strong>Steve Jobs </strong>(Danny Boyle, 2015) Friday, 1.45pm, 8pm, Sky Cinema Premiere</p> <p>Following the success of his Mark Zuckerberg biopic, The Social Network, Aaron Sorkin penned this portrait of another hi-tech/commercial genius \u2013 the Apple-designer-cum-cult-hero of the title. It\u2019s arranged into three acts, concerning the fraught launches of the original Apple Mac in 1984, the dodgy NeXT computer in 1988 and the beautiful iMac of 1998. Along with the tour de force of screenwriting, Michael Fassbender is a striking mix of technical wizardry, rage and omniscience in the lead role. <em>Paul Howlett</em></p> <p><strong>Frances Ha</strong> (Noah Baumbach, 2012) 11.05pm, BBC2</p> <p>After working together on Greenberg, director Baumbach and star Greta Gerwig co-wrote this portrait of a 27-year-old dancer. Shifting from the Brooklyn apartment she shares with former college friend Sophie (Mickey Sumner), Frances (Gerwig) goes on a quest for unspecified fulfilment. Shot in black and white, it\u2019s a funny, touching, angsty journey, even if Frances can be infuriatingly self-deceptive. <em>PH</em></p> <p><strong>Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy</strong> (Tomas Alfredson, 2011) 11.10pm, Film4</p> <p>John le Carr\u00e9\u2019s old-school spy George Smiley gets a top-class remake from Alfredson. Cold-war Britain is powerfully evoked in all its down-at-heel detail as Smiley (Gary Oldman) negotiates a mind-bogglingly complex plot of double- and triple-cross.

This has been a better game than I had expected. At least in this first half. The Broncos have put together several really good drives, unfortunately for them, two of them ended in brutal turnovers.

When the Broncos defeated the Panthers, Peyton Manning was an active player, Brock Osweiler was still in Denver and Cam Newton, and not Colin Kaepernick, was the most divisive player in the league. <br></p> <p>It was a different world. The biggest stain on Ryan Lochte\u2019s career was merely being a failed reality TV star, the Cleveland sports curse was still in effect and people still had hopes that the DC superhero movies would at least be vaguely watchable.

The first game of the season symbolizes the long-awaited resumption of actual football action, giving the whole event a ceremonial feel. Even the NFL\u2019s decision to kick off the season with this Super Bowl re-match doesn\u2019t necessarily ensure that we\u2019re about to witness an instant classic, as both teams might be starting the season rather tentatively. The Broncos, after all, are basically just <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2016/sep/05/afc-west-season-preview-denver-broncos-oakland-raiders-chiefs-chargers\">trying to figure out</a> what they have, if anything, at the quarterback position.

NHL coach <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nhl/story/_/id/17487174/us-world-cup-coach-john-tortorella-stands-anthem-comments\">John Tortorella</a> and NWSL Washington Spirit\u2019s owner <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JeffKassouf/status/773669540471443456\">Bill Lynch</a> became the latest sports figures failing miserably to think deeply about this topic.

He is simply requesting that there be proper punishment for unjustified police killings of black and brown people in this nation.</p> <p>All of the bile from those who loathe towards Kaepernick is unhealthy. That hatred will only increase throughout the NFL season, especially if Kaepernick wins back the Niners\u2019 starting quarterback job from the pedestrian Blaine Gabbert. All the public support and encouragement Kaepernick has received from high profile athletes and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ShaunKing/status/772944432945438720\">celebrities</a> will remain juxtaposed with those desperate for him to fail.</p> <p>And most of those disgusted with Kaepernick will continue to confuse or deny the message he is advocating for: that black and brown people don\u2019t deserved to be killed unjustly by those supposed to protect us.

  "<p>The UK will fail to meet its targets on renewable energy generation, with take-up of clean fuels for heating and transport falling badly behind aims, MPs have warned.</p> <p>The findings of the influential energy and climate change committee (ECC) show that ministers have little clear plan for meeting the 2020 target to meet 15% of energy needs from renewable sources. </p> <p>This includes a target to generate 30% of electricity from wind, solar and other low-carbon sources by the end of the decade, and to generate 12% of heating energy and 10% of transport fuels from clean sources by the same date. The UK is not legally bound to meet the heat target, which is advisory.</p> <p>These targets were set under the EU\u2019s renewable energy plan, but ministers are still required to meet them despite the Brexit vote. The UK is faring best on renewable electricity, the target for which may be met if current trends continue, but the proportion of renewable energy used for transport has fallen in the last year, and heating remains a significant problem.</p> <p>Angus MacNeil, the Scottish National party MP who chairs the committee, said: \u201cThe experts we spoke to were clear: the UK will miss its 2020 renewable energy targets without major policy improvements. Failing to meet these would damage the UK\u2019s reputation for climate change leadership. The government must take urgent action on heat and transport to renew its efforts on decarbonisation.\u201d</p> <p>The report findings are the latest warning over the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/may/10/uks-attractiveness-for-renewables-investment-plummets-to-all-time-low\">UK\u2019s waning attractions for renewable energy investors</a>.</p> <p>Heating and transport fuels are particular problems because there are few options available other than fossil fuels.

Unlike LGBTI people, they have nothing to lose and everything to gain.</p> <p>The plebiscite is not about democracy, human rights or constitutional change. It is a concocted last stand against LGBTI rights. If not, why this issue and not any other? It is a classic case of having lost in the parliament, then taking it to the people and having one last shot at defeating it courtesy of a public vote which gives anti-marriage equality groups the chance to run a campaign of lies and fear. It worked with Brexit, why not here?

He announced he had authorised a shocking anti-gay marriage brochure and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/feb/29/former-mp-threatens-to-distribute-millions-of-anti-marriage-equality-pamphlets\">threatened to distribute</a> a million copies.</p> <p>Under the Howard government, he founded the rightwing Lyons Forum and so \u2013surprise, surprise \u2013 when Eric Abetz and Kevin Andrews, who were co-founders of that forum, were dropped from the Turnbull ministry, he coincidentally reappeared. Twenty years later, they couldn\u2019t put out such a brochure but he could.</p> <p>This puts the lie to those Liberals who think dropping the plebiscite would undermine Turnbull. This is wrong. Holding the plebiscite will be the mechanism for the hard right to destroy Turnbull and delay marriage equality, two birds with the one stone. This is the flexing of the muscles of the emergent Tea Party. The Liberals know they can\u2019t do a Rudd, Gillard, Rudd but they can do an Abbott, Turnbull \u2013 fall on his sword \u2013 Abbott. Like Turnbull, David Cameron thought he couldn\u2019t lose but ended up as the fall guy. The referendum in the UK was the weapon of choice.</p> <p>There are so many reasons why the plebiscite is wrong. First on a matter of principle, you don\u2019t hold an opinion poll on human rights. They are inalienable. John Howard discriminated against LGBTI people by making them <a href=\"http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2004/05/27/1085461876842.html\">unequal before the law</a>. Now is the time to reverse his discrimination, not conduct an opinion poll with the \u201cno\u201d case publicly funded and designed to legitimise discrimination and human rights abuse.</p> <p>As to those in the LNP who argue that the plebiscite is the fastest way of securing marriage equality given the prime minister has refused a free parliamentary vote: no, what they mean to say is, it is the fastest way given their loyalty to the PM and their prospects for promotion and preselection in the Liberal party. These things outweigh their conviction on the issue such that they won\u2019t cross the floor.</p> <p>Those outside the LNP who think the same know that the plebiscite is wrong but are genuinely concerned about another three years of delay: to them I would say, firstly, the end does not justify the means, it is a dangerous precedent. I would also ask whether they had considered the \u201cno\u201d vote might win given our history of referenda and the ugly nature of the campaign.</p> <p>Secondly, I would say, consider the realpolitik. Does anyone seriously think it is in the interests of the LNP to keep marriage equality on the agenda, to keep stonewalling in the parliament right up until the next election, to keep putting marriage equality front and centre in an election in which the LNP will be fighting for its life? The rightwingers do, but it\u2019s hard to see the powerbrokers and remaining marginal seat holders sharing that opinion.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The plebiscite is wrong because it deliberately and knowingly hurts people.</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>If I am wrong and bloody mindedness prevails in a Custer\u2019s last stand reenactment, then it\u2019s good news for Australia, there will be a change of government and marriage equality will be secured. While it will be years later than it should have been, it will at least not be at the expense of the lives of many LGBTI people.</p> <p>If the plebiscite enabling legislation is defeated, I think the LNP will have to rethink its strategy. I would argue it is more likely, not less likely, that a free parliamentary vote would take place. As his approval rating falls, to save himself, Turnbull has to stand up to his enemies from within. The defeat of the enabling legislation creates that space.</p> <p>But putting aside the principle of it, the tactics surrounding it, even the ridiculous cost of it, the plebiscite is wrong because it deliberately and knowingly hurts people. I lived through the poisonous debate in Tasmania in the 1990s. I watched as LGBTI people were arrested in Salamanca Market because their very presence was said to offend the family values of the market. I walked into a public meeting in Devonport with Michael Kirby and people spat on his coat.</p> <p>I watched as young LGBTI people left the state because of the rejection they felt and I have heard the stories of suicide in the face of that rejection. I watched the bravery, pain and suffering of those who stayed and through the Tasmanian Gay and Lesbian Group took their case all the way to the United Nations. When I first put my legislation to the Tasmanian Parliament for gay law reform in 1996, Michael Hodgman former Liberal MP for Denison called me the \u201cmother of teenage sodomy\u201d on ABC radio.</p> <p>On the streets, it was worse. I couldn\u2019t count the number of times Bob Brown was abused from passing cars or jeering passersby. In the Senate, innuendo and offensive remarks were made about LGBTI people from elements within both sides of politics but I am proud to say the Australian Greens have never wavered, every vote, every time to end discrimination and for marriage equality.</p> <p>As the mother of a gay son, my sense of justice is deeply offended that some people think it is OK for the whole of Australia to have a say in whether he can marry the person he loves, whereas for their own heterosexual sons and daughters, they consider it is no one else\u2019s business.</p> <p>I ask you, how would you feel if someone told you that they thought your son or daughter should be denied the same rights as their children on the sole basis of their sexuality or their race or their gender?</p> <p>Anyone who thinks that because gay rights are inevitable, that things have moved on and there will be an outpouring of sweetness and light, think again. Last stands engender extreme tactics.

My friend and I were some of the only women in the room.  I was feeling nervous.  I was a senior in college.  I wasn\u2019t sure how well I\u2019d do.  And while we\u2019re waiting for the exam to start, a group of men began to yell things like: \u2018You don\u2019t need to be here.\u2019 And \u2018There\u2019s plenty else you can do.\u2019 It turned into a real \u2018pile on.\u2019 One of them even said: \u2018If you take my spot, I\u2019ll get drafted, and I\u2019ll go to Vietnam, and I&amp;#39;ll die.\u2019 And they weren\u2019t kidding around.  It was intense.  It got very personal.  But I couldn\u2019t respond.  I couldn\u2019t afford to get distracted because I didn\u2019t want to mess up the test.  So I just kept looking down, hoping that the proctor would walk in the room.  I know that I can be perceived as aloof or cold or unemotional.  But I had to learn as a young woman to control my emotions.  And that\u2019s a hard path to walk.  Because you need to protect yourself, you need to keep steady, but at the same time you don\u2019t want to seem \u2018walled off.\u2019 And sometimes I think I come across more in the \u2018walled off\u2019 arena.  And if I create that perception, then I take responsibility.  I don\u2019t view myself as cold or unemotional.  And neither do my friends.  And neither does my family.

In August, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/sep/02/us-jobs-report-august-economy\">US created 151,000 jobs</a> - about 30,000 below expectations. However, on average the US economy added about 230,000 a month over the last three months. August was the 71st consecutive month of overall job creation- longest streak on record. It was also the 77th consecutive month of private sector job growth.</p> <p>The Obama administration insists that the jobs added over the past few months tend to be good, middle class jobs rather than \u201cbad jobs\u201d as Trump described them. According to US labor secretary Tom Perez, education and health sectors have added the most job in the last year, followed by professional and business services.</p> <p>\u201cI use these two examples to highlight what we are seeing in this recovery, which is over the last two to three years, not only do we see a growth in the quantity of jobs but we are seeing a distinct growth in the quality of jobs. More and more middle class and above jobs are being created in the last two to three years,\u201d he told the Guardian on Friday.</p> <p>\u201cAnother sector that is really rebounding - especially in the last few months is government, which during the early stages of the recovery it usually recovers really fast but it didn\u2019t. And now we are seeing some real rebound in government jobs, which tend to be solid middle class jobs. I am heartened not just by the number of jobs we are creating but by the quality of jobs that are being created.\u201d</p> <p>One of the main reasons for the delay in recovery in government sector is the sequester - the automatic budget cuts that were included in the 2011 Budget Control Act. Had it been not for the budget cuts championed by Congress Republicans after the 2008 economic crisis, unemployment rate might have been higher, said Perez.</p> <p>\u201cIf we had the investment rates that we saw during the Reagan administration now, we would have an unemployment rate that would be probably two to three tenths of a percent lower than it currently is,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/sep/05/barack-obama-us-minimum-wage-republicans-tom-perez\">he said</a>. The US unemployment rate is 4.9%. \u201cBut the lingering effect of sequester has a dramatically negative impact on government hiring and it also had on a federal level and on state and local level.\u201d</p> <p>Despite better jobs being created, there are still more than six million Americans who want full time jobs, but are only working part-time at the moment. Additionally, there are 7.5 million Americans who are working more than one jobs to make ends meet.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/11/us-economy-recession-republicans-hillary-clinton-policy\">Republicans have themselves to blame for the slow economy, study says</a> </p> </aside> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57d1c2eee4b013613fffb61f\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-08T20:01:40.739Z\">9.01pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Esquire Magazine has added an editor\u2019s note to <a href=\"http://www.esquire.com/news-politics/a37230/donald-trump-esquire-cover-story-august-2004/\">a profile of Donald Trump</a> that the Republican presidential nominee has repeatedly cited as proof that he never supported the invasion of Iraq, calling the characterization inaccurate:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p> The following story was published in the August 2004 issue of Esquire.

My friend and I were some of the only women in the room.  I was feeling nervous.  I was a senior in college.  I wasn\u2019t sure how well I\u2019d do.  And while we\u2019re waiting for the exam to start, a group of men began to yell things like: \u2018You don\u2019t need to be here.\u2019 And \u2018There\u2019s plenty else you can do.\u2019 It turned into a real \u2018pile on.\u2019 One of them even said: \u2018If you take my spot, I\u2019ll get drafted, and I\u2019ll go to Vietnam, and I&amp;#39;ll die.\u2019 And they weren\u2019t kidding around.  It was intense.  It got very personal.  But I couldn\u2019t respond.  I couldn\u2019t afford to get distracted because I didn\u2019t want to mess up the test.  So I just kept looking down, hoping that the proctor would walk in the room.  I know that I can be perceived as aloof or cold or unemotional.  But I had to learn as a young woman to control my emotions.  And that\u2019s a hard path to walk.

Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump appeared back-to-back on TV Wednesday night to take questions about foreign policy, veterans\u2019 affairs and, in Clinton\u2019s case, her emails. </p> <p>Clinton was criticized for not getting to her points quickly enough for the tight format. Trump was criticized for not having any points to make, instead ordering \u201coff his familiar campaign menu of word salads\u201d, as Guardian national security editor Spencer Ackerman writes: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>He <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeed.com/kyleblaine/donald-trump-lies-that-he-opposed-iraq-war-from-beginning-an?utm_term=.wt2E7Y2rwP\">lied about opposing the Iraq war</a>, criticized Obama\u2019s 2011 withdrawal and repeated his now-boilerplate advocacy of stealing Iraq\u2019s oil \u2013 a measure that he evidently believes would require a minimal force presence, despite the certainty that the well-armed locals might have a problem with their principal source of wealth being plundered by a foreign power.</p> <p>Speaking before an audience of veterans, Trump unexpectedly attacked the current generation of generals and flag officers. The current senior officer corps has been \u201creduced to rubble\u201d, Trump said, and were \u201cembarrassing for our country\u201d. While previously Trump had said he <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/11/13/the-remarkably-unappealling-anger-of-donald-trump/\">knew better than the generals</a> about fighting Isis, this time he intimated that he\u2019d get \u201cdifferent generals\u201d \u2013 a habit more typical of caudillos than American presidents.</p> <p>He followed up by saying his ultimate plan to defeat Isis would be some parts of his still-unspecified plan, and some parts of his unspecified generals\u2019 unspecified plan. He waved away his lack of specifics for a war in which 5,000 US troops are currently serving as not wishing to \u201cbroadcast\u201d his plans to the enemy.</p> </blockquote> <p>Read the full piece here:</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/08/for-clinton-a-skirmish-with-history-from-trump-an-ambush-of-the-facts\">For Clinton, a skirmish with history.

We weren\u2019t prepared to deal with a mentally ill dog, and we can categorically state that people around us aren\u2019t either.</p> <p>With <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/24/greyhound-racing-banned-in-new-south-wales-as-bill-passes-parliament\">greyhound racing now thankfully banned in NSW</a>, there is an influx of rescue dogs coming into people\u2019s homes. Greyhounds seem to be an almost universally perfect rescue dog, and don\u2019t come with a large host of problems, however, a lot of them have been through some fairly serious abuse. </p> <p>Some ex-racers have been trained with live-baiting, starved and even dosed on methamphetamines to make them more \u201ccompetitive\u201d. Their housing situations are often extremely competitive, making some of them territorial around food, and jumpy when it comes to sleeping situations. </p> <p>It\u2019s easy to see that while the majority of them are the perfect dogs, some will come with additional mental health issues, of which owners and the general public don\u2019t seem to have a lot of knowledge. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jul/11/theres-never-been-a-better-time-to-rescue-a-dog\">Falling in love with Pete: there's never been a better time to rescue a dog | Steph Harmon</a> </p> </aside>  <p>At a recent Adopt a Greyhound event, I watched, with my heart in my mouth, as a mother held her toddler up to face level of a greyhound. Luckily, the dog was bemused at most, and had the poise to simply shuffle away from the offending grabbing hands and loud noises. If it had been my nightmare dog, that child would have been bitten. </p> <p> Adopting a rescue dog is both rewarding and the right thing to do but people need to understand that they can be complicated, and to have a little sympathy and consideration.</p> <p>Over the past few years, there\u2019s been a couple of simple things I\u2019ve picked up which are a good way to start being mindful about pets with mental health issues, and ways in which you can help make a difference.</p> <ul> <li>Make sure you check with someone before approaching a leashed dog \u2013 people don\u2019t do this with Ginny, and they get bitten.</li> <li>Don\u2019t let leashed dogs go and interact with other leashed dogs \u2013 it\u2019s a very stressful experience for them, and can easily lead to fights.</li> <li>Really watch out for children \u2013 keep them out of dogs\u2019 faces, and don\u2019t let them touch and annoy dogs. Even the calmest dog can feel confused by a child all up in their zone.</li> <li>If you see someone training or discipling their dog, don\u2019t interrupt. Also, don\u2019t go and give us unsolicited advice, there\u2019s a really good chance they\u2019ve heard it all.</li> <li>If your neighbours\u2019 dogs are barking or causing trouble, try to talk to the owners. There could be a compromise or easily-found solution.</li> <li>If you have a dog you suspect has anxiety or other mental health issues, go see a behaviouralist, they can help you understand what the sources of their bad behaviour are and how to manage them.<br></li> </ul> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p>Ginny has taught us so much about boundaries, about how to respect a dog\u2019s personal space and how to adapt to their needs. Our society expects dogs to adapt entirely to the ways we want them to behave yet it\u2019s us who are abusing and treating dogs badly. </p> <p>Learning how to cater better for mentally ill dogs is actually a responsibility we all share, and it starts by understanding that their space and their behaviour isn\u2019t automatically yours to invade and dictate. It\u2019s about recognising when dogs are uncomfortable, getting out of their faces, and understanding that their behaviour mightn\u2019t be the result of poor training or viciousness. It\u2019s about learning that it\u2019s us, the humans, who might have to modify our behaviour.</p> <ul> <li>This article was amended on 12 September 2016 to amend the imputation that greyhounds are often trained with live-baiting. <br></li> </ul>",
  "<p>A three-week-old baby was among a group of 10 people discovered in the back of a lorry at a motorway service station on Tuesday.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/1751777/20-day-old-tot-rescued-from-back-of-lorry-in-watford-after-being-smuggled-from-calais-jungle/\">The Sun reported</a> that the group, mostly from Iraq, had travelled from Calais and spent 10 hours in the Spanish-registered lorry.</p> <p>The alarm was raised at Watford Gap services on the M1 in Northamptonshire after people could be heard banging from inside the vehicle and shouting \u201cno air\u201d.</p> <p>Police who opened the lorry\u2019s doors found the group struggling to breathe in the stifling heat along with the infant. A toddler was also among the group.</p> <p>Richard Glover from Wellingborough told the Sun: \u201cI could see no food or water in the lorry. It had been a muggy night and it was a warm day, so conditions would have been stifling. They could all have suffocated in there \u2013 including the baby.\u201d</p> <p>A Home Office spokesperson said the incident was concerning and was being investigated: \u201cWould-be migrants need to be aware that they are putting their lives, and those of their loved ones, at risk by attempting to reach the UK illegally.</p> <p> \u201cThat is why we have increased security and boosted technology used at border controls and are working with law enforcement at home and abroad to target the criminal gangs who are often behind such attempts.\u201d</p> <p>The Home Office said Northamptonshire police had alerted immigration enforcement officers. Nine of the migrants said they were from Iraq, with another from Iran. </p> <p>They all had medical checks and the infant was said to be healthy. </p> <p>According to the Sun, the parents of the infant paid a people-smuggler to travel from Turkey to Greece before making their way to France. Their six-year-old son, who was not travelling with them, reportedly drowned when the boat he was in sank, killing a further 21 people.</p> <p>The baby was born last month in \u201cthe Jungle\u201d refugee camp that is home to about 10,000 people. It sparked protests from Calais residents earlier this week who want it to be shut down.</p> <p>Immigration minister Robert Goodwill told MPs on Tuesday that work was about to begin on a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/06/uk-immigration-minister-confirms-work-will-begin-on-big-new-wall-in-calais\">four-metre high wall</a> in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/calais\">Calais</a> in the latest attempt to prevent refugees and migrants getting on to lorries heading for the Channel port. </p> <p>It will be part of a \u00a317m package of joint Anglo-French security measures to tighten precautions at the port. Construction of the 1km-long wall along the ferry port\u2019s main dual carriageway approach road, known as the Rocade, is due to start this month.</p>",

If Storey successfully defends her title, she will be out on her own as the most decorated British female Paralympian of all time.</p> <p>It has been a long time coming, a record 24 years in the making. Having <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/sep/06/paralympics-sarah-storey-road-race\">equalled Tanni Grey-Thompson\u2019s tally of 11 gold medals</a> in London four years ago, a new landmark is in sight for Storey. Appearing in her seventh Paralympics, she could reach it on the first day of competition in Rio.</p> <p>However, there is no room for complacency. \u201cI always think people who assume things are a little bit silly because it\u2019s sport and I\u2019m there to be shot at,\u201d said the 38-year-old from Stockport, who made the switch from swimming to cycling at Beijing in 2008. \u201cI\u2019ve been shot at unsuccessfully by a lot of athletes over the last three Paralympic cycles, since I first started in Beijing. Everyone wants to beat me. If you ask the other athletes who they want to beat, they all want to beat me, which is a massive compliment. If I can successfully defend my individual pursuit title again then I\u2019d be absolutely over the moon.</p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/sep/07/sarah-storey-other-athletes-want-to-beat-me-massive-compliment-cyclist-paralympics-rio\">Read the full interview here</a>.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-09-08T13:54:13.056Z\">at 2.54pm BST</time></p>  </div>"
