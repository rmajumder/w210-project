  "<p> Every police officer is guilty of some sort of bias, according to their professional standards body, and acknowledging as much is necessary to help stamp out discrimination in the use of controversial stop and search powers.</p> <p>The College of Policing on Thursday launches new guidelines for police on stop and search and also warns that an officer should consider if a bias is affecting his or her decision every time before making a stop. If they think prejudice is playing a part, they should not use the power.<br></p> <p>Richard Bennett, of the College of Policing said: \u201cOur assumption is that every single person has biases. But the important thing if you\u2019re someone acting on behalf of the state and exercising your powers is to recognise those biases and to ensure they do not impact on your decision-making around things like stop and search and other operational decision.\u201d</p> <p> </p> <p> Stop and search has been blighted by overuse against black people \u2013 known as disproportionality. Police have been found by their watchdog to be exercising the power unlawfully, and the vast majority of uses end up stopping the innocent. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/27/white-youngsters-make-mistakes-police-justice-committee\">White and rich \u2013 the justice system gives you a pass.

The College of Policing, set up by the government to professionalise the service, says the bias training has already been tried by 1,300 officers.</p> <p>The college released three examples of a stop where there were clear grounds, where the situation was ambiguous and where there was no justification at all. In the example where there were no grounds at all, it describes a situation where an officer sees a convicted burglar in a high crime area at 3am.</p> <p>\u201cThe officer stops and speaks to the subject who refuses to speak with the officer (there is no legal requirement to do so). There is no information or intelligence to say that this person, at this time, is likely to be in possession of a stolen or prohibited article.

He added biases also affected the use of the power against young and east Europeans, for instance, in the Midlands.<br></p> <p> </p> <p> Stinson said: \u201cWhat we want to do is give the officers confidence. If they\u2019ve got reasonable grounds and they\u2019ve got the power that they can search people, they must do it. There\u2019s a massive step between \u2018I\u2019ve got a gut instinct he\u2019s a wrong \u2018un\u2019 through to \u2018that gives me the evidence to get in their pockets\u201d.</p> <p> </p> <p> Stop and search was linked to stoking discontent that fueled the 2011 riots that spread across England. Its use has been cut in recent years but there are still concerns that it may be damaging community relations.</p> <p>Steve Otter, who recently retired as a senior inspector with Her Majesty\u2019s Inspectorate of Constabulary, found <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2016/feb/11/uk-police-forces-still-abusing-stop-and-search-powers\">in a report released in February</a> there were continued abuses by officers and failures by forces. He warned police legitimacy was being drained, one in seven stops may be unlawful and added: \u201cEvery single major report into disorder in this country since 1970 places stop and search as one of, if not the most important contributing factor, and those lessons need to be learned.\u201d</p> <p> </p> <h2> Examples of stop and search scenarios given to officers:</h2> <h2>Clear grounds for a stop</h2> <p>An officer on patrol is told by a shop owner that the person running away has stolen some goods and points to the person in question. The suspect continues to run from officers and refuses to answer questions when stopped clearly concealing an item under their jacket. The CCTV in the shop shows the person concealing something under their jacket before running out when challenged by the shop keeper.<br></p> <h2> Ambiguous grounds for a stop</h2> <p>Officer is directed to the scene of a recent knife-point robbery involving a young male described as being dressed in black and running away. The officer reaches the area within seconds to see a young male dressed in black running towards an approaching bus. There are numerous other people in the area.<br></p> <h2> No grounds for a stop</h2> <p>Officer sees a convicted burglar in a high crime area at 3am in the morning.

There is no information or intelligence to say that this person, at this time, is likely to be in possession of a stolen or prohibited article. The person says they are on their way home and lives nearby. A subsequent PNC check reveals the person is not currently wanted nor have there been any reported crimes in the immediate area that evening. </p>",
  "<p>A Labour demand for the UK government to withdraw support for the Saudi-led coalition in the 18-month Yemen civil war failed on Wednesday when a substantial number of Labour backbenchers either stayed away or abstained.</p> <p>In a Commons debate, the shadow foreign secretary, Emily Thornberry, said the government should withdraw support from the Saudi coalition until an independent UN investigation had examined whether the Saudi bombing campaign, which has seen the deaths of thousands of Yemeni civilians, was in breach of international humanitarian law.</p> <p>The Labour front bench, partly due to resistance from unions with membership in the defence industry, did not explicitly call for a suspension of UK arms sales to Saudi Arabia until the independent inquiry reported. The Labour call for ministers to withdraw support from the Saudi coalition was defeated by 283 to 193, suggesting that scores of Labour MPs did not vote.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/23/yemen-war-resumes-both-sides-ignore-un-call-extend-ceasefire\">Yemen war resumes as both sides ignore UN call to extend ceasefire</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, rejected any suspension of arms sales, saying other western countries would \u201chappily supply arms\u201d to Saudi Arabia without the same protections should Britain suspend its sales. He added that suspending arms sales would \u201cat a stroke\u201d eliminate Britain\u2019s diplomatic influence on the Yemen conflict, in which the Saudi Arabian-led coalition has been accused of war crimes. He also said it was right that Saudi Arabia first conducted its own investigation.</p> <p>In a compromise on 30 September, the UN Human Rights Council in Geneva, with the backing of the UK, did not support an immediate independent UN inquiry, but instead called for UN experts to be given a role in assisting an existing Yemen-led inquiry.</p> <p>Johnson\u2019s foreign office deputy, Tobias Ellwood, accepted that Saudi Arabia\u2019s own internal inquiries into its bombing campaign had been unduly slow. He added that he expected a specific senior Saudi officer to be subject to a court-martial for failing to follow internal procedures when Saudi planes on 8 October bombed a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/08/saudi-led-coalition-airstrike-hit-yemen-funeral-officials-say\">funeral in Yemen\u2019s capital, killing more than 140 people</a> and wounding hundreds of others.</p> <p>Johnson warned the Saudis they \u201cshould be in no doubt that we in this country are monitoring the situation minutely and meticulously, and will continue to apply our established criteria for granting licences with fairness and rigour, and in full accordance with UK law\u201d.</p> <p>But he added that if the UK suspended arms sales, \u201cbe in no doubt that we would be vacating a space that would rapidly be filled by other western countries who would happily supply arms with nothing like the same compunctions or criteria or respect for humanitarian law. And more importantly, we would at a stroke eliminate this country\u2019s positive ability to exercise our moderating, diplomatic and political influence on a crisis where there are massive UK interests at stake.\u201d</p> <p>Johnson also claimed Thornberry had \u201csubstantially retreated\u201d from the opposition\u2019s motion, specifically over whether to suspend weapons sales.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/15/heinous-against-humanity-how-saudi-airstrikes-have-devastated-yemen\">'Heinous crime against humanity': how Saudi airstrikes have devastated Yemen</a> </p> </aside>  <p>He said: \u201cUnder questioning \u2026 as to whether or not she would support the immediate suspension of arms sales to Saudi Arabia and the Saudi Arabian-led coalition forces, as is specified in this motion in her name, she refused to say that she would\u201d.</p> <p>But Thornberry disagreed, saying the Labour motion simply called on ministers to suspend support to the coalition until it has been determined whether they had been responsible for violations of international humanitarian law.</p> <p>John Woodcock, the Labour MP for Barrow, asked Thornberry how UK withdrawal of support for the coalition \u2013 focused on training Saudis in compliance with international humanitarian law \u2013 would create fewer civilian casualties.</p> <p>Thornberry answered that the overwhelming evidence suggested that Saudi Arabia was not listening to UK advice, and that the Saudis had only produced nine reports on its bombing incidents, and could not provide a timetable for the completion of further reports.

The other centre, operating out of southern Saudi Arabia, \u201ccarried out dynamic, reactive operations often on the basis of sketchy evidence, often without thinking through the so-called \u2018collateral damage\u2019, and inevitably often with significant civilian casualties.</p> <p>\u201cOf course, if it is the case that any coalition forces are acting in a reckless or indiscriminate manner when it comes to air strikes in civilian areas, it would itself be a clear violation of international humanitarian law and cause this whole house grave concern.\u201d</p> <p>Thornberry said Ellwood had described the funeral bombing as a \u201cdeliberate error\u201d, raising the prospect of \u201cintentional targeting of civilians by elements of the coalition forces\u201d. She added: \u201cWhen we say one thing about Russia and Aleppo but we say another thing about Riyadh and Yemen, what the rest of the world hears is hypocrisy and double standards.</p> <p>\u201cWhile Saudi Arabia will remain a valued strategic security economic ally, our support for their forces in Yemen must be suspended until alleged violations of international humanitarian law in that conflict have been fully and independently investigated, and until the children of Yemen have received the humanitarian aid they so desperately need.\u201d</p> <p>Chris White, the Conservative chairman of the all-party select committee on arms export controls, also said there had been violations of international humanitarian law in Yemen justifying an independent, UN-led investigation, and the suspension of arms sales pending the inquiry.</p> <p>He questioned whether civilian casualties at such a level could be regarded as a mistake. He said whether the mistakes were intentional or not, they represented a breach of humanitarian law, and the default position of the government should be to pause sales until it was satisfied with the conduct of the campaign.</p>",

  "<p>It always was wishful thinking that the occasion would pass off without any ugly incidents in the stands. They came so close. But just when it seemed that West Ham United were easing towards a largely peaceful 2-0 victory over Chelsea in the League Cup, fighting broke out between home and away fans behind Darren Randolph\u2019s goal, transforming a magnificent night on the pitch for Slaven Bilic\u2019s resurgent side into a PR disaster.</p> <p>Stewards and police were forced to intervene, coins and bottles flew through the East End air and seats were thrown as rival supporters clashed on the concourse at the back of the lower tier of the Sir Trevor Brooking Stand for a couple of minutes. As the nonsense unravelled, Gary Cahill pulled one back for Chelsea at the death, but West Ham still went through to the last eight. Once again, however, there were serious questions to be asked of the level of security inside their new ground, which cracked under the strain of hosting a big match.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/oct/27/fa-west-ham-chelsea-crowd-trouble-investigation\">FA launches investigation into crowd trouble at West Ham v Chelsea tie</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Let\u2019s avoid calling it a throwback to the 80s. That would be overly dramatic, while it should be pointed out that West Ham had worked hard with authorities to control the situation before the match. The actions of an idiotic minority marred the occasion, giving their fellow supporters an unwarranted bad name.</p> <p>However the brawling that marred a rollocking match helped to explain why there were 11,000 empty seats inside a ground with a capacity of 57,000, with the prospect of hooliganism heightening the air of tension at the London Stadium.</p> <p>After a dreadful start to the season, Bilic has revitalised West Ham in recent weeks and the manager was exasperated that the second question he was asked after the match was about crowd violence rather than his team\u2019s excellence. It was a shame that the attention was dragged away from their third consecutive win. Such is life.</p> <p>West Ham will be forced on the back foot again, with the Football Association likely to take a dim view of the scenes that everyone dreaded. Both clubs could face sanctions, while West Ham and the stadium organisers will have to reassess the organisation inside the ground. The ease with which supporters broke through the line of segregation caused deep concern. Stewards were outnumbered as fans converged on each other near one of the exits in the stand\u2019s lower tier, creating a bottleneck. Sirens blared after the game. Families might well wonder if it is worth the hassle next time.</p> <p>Organisational imperfections must be ironed out. With more than 5,000 Chelsea fans in attendance, only eight turnstiles were in operation and the away end was slow to fill up before kick-off, adding to the unease. Things calmed down. Inside the ground, the atmosphere was superb, a proper derby, feisty and thrillingly intense. Tempers flared again later on, though.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a3b6011a224b5c501402e86fe65ce11f560a479d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a3b6011a224b5c501402e86fe65ce11f560a479d/0_0_3500_2115/1000.jpg\" alt=\"West Ham United and Chelsea fans during the game.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"604\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">West Ham United and Chelsea fans during the game.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nick Potts/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Initially it was a relief to focus on the football when Cheikhou Kouyat\u00e9 scored an early header and there was a sense that West Ham felt at home for the first time since leaving Upton Park.

Little has gone smoothly since moving to Stratford, from home fans fighting amongst themselves to issues over segregation inside and outside the ground.</p> <p>The enmity between Chelsea and West Ham fans meant that this was the sternest test yet of policing and stewarding inside and outside the stadium. Supporters were advised to arrive early, many nearby pubs stopped serving alcohol an hour before the game and this was the first time that the streets outside were packed with police vans and officers on horseback, while plans were in place to keep home fans from the away end after the match.</p> <p>When the inquest begins, though, West Ham should ask themselves why their first derby under lights did not take place in front of a sell-out crowd. Quite simply, it was the consequence of the shortcomings in security in previous matches. People will stay away if they do not feel safe. The price of a ticket should not come with the threat of a coin or seat landing on your head.</p>",
  "<p>Manchester United\u2019s week took a much needed turn for the better as a Juan Mata goal propelled them into the last eight of the EFL Cup at the expense of their neighbours. Whether Jos\u00e9 Mourinho wants an extended run in this competition is another matter \u2013 United have drawn West Ham at home in the next round \u2013 but at least he and his team have shifted some of the pressure on to his rival across town.</p> <p>Doubtless Pep Guardiola is not greatly enamoured of the lesser of the domestic trophies either, though he could have done with a victory here. This was City\u2019s sixth game in a row without a win, uncharted territory for their manager. The side he selected did not suggest an intention to win at all costs and, if he did not have an inkling before, the manager must now be fully aware that without David Silva and Kevin De Bruyne City tend to be short of snap and polish.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/oct/26/manchester-united-west-ham-efl-cup\">Manchester United to host West Ham in EFL Cup quarter-finals</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cIt was nice to score but the most important thing was to put the last defeat behind us,\u201d Mata said. \u201cWe had a bad day in London [at Chelsea] and we knew we had to be strong and give 100% in this game.\u201d</p> <p>Both sides made changes from their weekend lineups, though City made the most. Sergio Ag\u00fcero was named on the bench, John Stones left out and young prospects Aleix Garc\u00eda and Pablo Maffeo given rare starts, the latter making his first-team debut. Considering Marcos Rojo came in for the injured Eric Bailly the United team was closer to full strength, with Chris Smalling left out and Michael Carrick preferred to Marouane Fellaini.</p> <p>Mourinho apologised in the match programme <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/oct/23/chelsea-manchester-united-premier-league-match-report\">for the performance at Chelsea</a> and though he has previously said the EFL Cup has to be the lowest of his priorities, with this derby coming so quickly after the Stamford Bridge debacle he was aware of the need to field a side capable of obtaining a more acceptable result.</p> <p>United went behind in the first minute at Chelsea and survived a second-minute scare here. Jes\u00fas Navas crossed from the right and found Kelechi Iheanacho in front of goal, but the striker could not adjust his body position in time and his close-range header flew over.</p> <p>The home side\u2019s three-man midfield allowed Paul Pogba a freer role than has generally been the case this season and the France player\u2019s mobility showed up well in the opening stages, though City moved the ball around better with their short-passing game and Garc\u00eda was involved in several early attacks.</p> <p>For all that it was a fairly low wattage, error-ridden derby in the first half, short on quality and anything resembling goalmouth incident. Vincent Kompany seemed to sum up the paucity of proceedings when he hoofed the ball into touch like a rugby player when under no pressure in his own half, an odd sight quickly followed by the normally reliable Mata doing almost exactly the same thing.</p> <p>For most of the evening the City support, though outnumbered, had been making much more noise than their hosts, though a couple of interventions by Zlatan Ibrahimovic just before the interval finally brought the home crowd into voice. Poised to attempt the game\u2019s first effort on target the Swede was foiled in the act of shooting by a timely block from Nicol\u00e1s Otamendi, then when Ibrahimovic released Marcus Rashford down the left the teenager was only stopped by an even better tackle from Maffeo.</p> <p>Promising as those moments were for the home side, United could still have turned round behind. Five minutes from the break Iheanacho had a clear sight of goal on the left but held on to the ball too long in an attempt to improve his shooting angle and was dispossessed by Rojo coming across to cover from the opposite flank.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/oct/26/jose-mourinho-manchester-united-fans-pep-guardiola-manchester-city\">Jos\u00e9 Mourinho proud his players gave something back after heavy defeat</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Not entirely unexpectedly in front of the watching Belgium manager Kompany failed to appear for the second half, which began with Iheanacho wasting a good position by passing to an offside Nolito instead of spotting a better timed run from Leroy San\u00e9. Actual excitement finally arrived a couple of minutes later, with Ibrahimovic effortlessly giving Otamendi the slip to set up Pogba, who looked certain to score only for the faintest brush of Willy Caballero\u2019s gloves to touch his shot on to a post.</p> <p>United were not to be denied, however, and took the lead on their next attack when the outstanding Ibrahimovic rolled a low cross into the City area towards Ander Herrera. Mike Dean could easily have awarded a penalty as the midfielder was unceremoniously bundled off the ball by Fernando and might have done so but for the ball running free for Mata to find Caballero\u2019s bottom corner.</p> <p>United had upped their tempo noticeably since the interval and deserved to go in front, the City fans contented themselves with a plea for Ag\u00fcero to be sent on. They got Raheem Sterling instead. Making the most of City\u2019s disruption at the back United could have gone further in front when Rashford crossed from the left for Ibrahimovic; uncharacteristically the striker failed to make any sort of contact.</p> <p>Guardiola did send Ag\u00fcero on after that, to little effect.

  "<p>Theresa May is not the first politician to have been caught out saying one thing to an audience of bankers and another to voters. Earlier this month Hillary Clinton, the US presidential candidate, was revealed to have taken $675,000 to speak at Goldman Sachs where she adopted a friendlier, more pro-business persona than that offered to the American public. On this side of the Atlantic the Guardian <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/25/exclusive-leaked-recording-shows-what-theresa-may-really-thinks-about-brexit\" title=\"\">unearthed an audio recording</a> of a previously undisclosed private question-and-answer session the prime minister had with Goldman Sachs bankers this May on the defining issue of Britain\u2019s relationship with Europe. In a wide-ranging discussion the PM went beyond her current gnomic utterance to voters that \u201cBrexit means Brexit\u201d. The then home secretary showed in private that she was more committed to staying in the European Union than the tepid support she gave to the remain campaign. Her most revealing exchange is her stark warning that corporate outlays in the UK would be at risk if the country left Europe. <a href=\"http://www.conservativehome.com/parliament/2016/04/theresa-mays-speech-on-brexit-full-text.html\" title=\"\">Yet a month earlier in her only major speech she blamed \u201cdiscrimatory EU policies\u201d</a> for the threat to investment in a post-Brexit Britain.</p> <p>It is an irony that in the cloistered preserve of Goldman Sachs, a temple of power and privilege, normally guarded politicans lift the veil of caution. We must be thankful for small mercies. In private to bankers Mrs May said if we voted to leave, European business would make rational decisions about the size of the EU trading bloc, and leave Britain. In public she blamed such decisions on Brussels for discriminating against Britain. Jeremy Corbyn, who missed a trick to hammer home this point at prime minister\u2019s questions, later correctly identified Mrs May\u2019s Janus-like pronouncements. The questions raised by the Goldman Sachs tape are clear: Does she believe now what she said then? If not, why not? The evidence is mounting that she was right to point to stormy times for a Brexit economy in the years ahead. A new <a href=\"http://www.resolutionfoundation.org/publications/pressing-the-reset-button-the-public-finance-options-facing-the-new-chancellor-at-the-autumn-statement/\" title=\"\">analysis by the Resolution Foundation</a> finds that the economy is likely to shrink by \u00a360bn, most of this down to leaving Europe.</p> <p>This smaller Brexit nation would be characterised by lower average earnings, higher inflation and 600,000 fewer jobs in 2020. No wonder the chancellor, Philip Hammond, is fighting a rearguard action to maintain access to the single market. The study says he will be staring at an \u00a384bn hole in the public finances. Mr Hammond knows his room for manoeuvre is tight \u2013 and <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-36864099\" title=\"\">that he will have to fudge or break George Osborne\u2019s rules</a> on spending and debt as a proportion of GDP to ensure the motor of the economy does not stall. No doubt leading Brexiters will drop their ideological objections to a looser fiscal position so that extra taxpayers\u2019 cash can be spent to keep the engine ticking over as the gears shift to a post-European economy.</p> <p>The wider macroeconomic picture is criss-crossed by unpromising circumstances. The politics turns <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-37710786\" title=\"\">towards a harder Brexit</a>: outside the single market, with maximum control over immigration. The economics would be costly: raising questions over whether London can maintain its position as a major hub for financial services across the EU. The UK\u2019s position as <a href=\"http://atlas.media.mit.edu/en/profile/country/gbr/\" title=\"\">the ninth-largest exporter in the world</a> is threatened. Curbs on EU migrants, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2014/nov/05/eu-migrants-uk-gains-20bn-ucl-study\" title=\"\">who pay more in tax than they take out in benefits</a>, may strain public finances. How to resolve such contradictions remains a puzzle even to those involved at the highest level of government, as the leaders of the devolved assemblies found on Monday.</p> <p>Unlike other remainers, as home secretary Mrs May failed to vigorously defend Britain\u2019s EU membership. Her one speech was a Eurosceptic explanation of why, after considering the pros and cons, she thought it was best to vote remain. In that speech on the crucial question of the British economy she played up her Euroscepticism. This has helped to set a direction of travel for Britain\u2019s economy that she herself condemned to Goldman\u2019s bankers. Why did Mrs May say one thing in private and another in public?</p>",

If you haven\u2019t figured it out by now, then maybe you didn\u2019t watch last night\u2019s NBA openers. I practically telegraphed this comparison \u2013 the same things we\u2019re saying about the Warriors today are the things we said about the Cavs two years ago. That\u2019s because the question is identical. How do you seamlessly integrate a superstar into an existing team that already has a superstar? After <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/oct/26/spurs-thrash-warriors-in-nba-opener-as-cavaliers-roar-past-knicks\">losing to the San Antonio Spurs in spectacular fashion</a>, 129-100, in their first game of the year, it\u2019s clear the Warriors have not sorted that one out yet.</p> <p>Opinions on why the Warriors struggled vary wildly. Some, like TNT analyst Reggie Miller said it\u2019s because Kevin Durant is used to playing isolation ball and standing around the top of the key until he\u2019s passed to, that the Warriors offense requires constantly off-ball movement. Deadspin\u2019s Tom Ley <a href=\"http://deadspin.com/so-the-warriors-got-their-asses-kicked-1788229221\">said almost the opposite</a>, wondering why the Warriors would \u201cask a player of Durant\u2019s quality to do nothing but stand in the corner and wait for open threes in order to maintain the offense\u2019s shape and spacing.\u201d</p> <p>But the other side of the ball seems like a far more pressing concern. Golden State gave up 129 points to the Spurs, Kawhi Leonard racked up a career-high 35 points on his own, and someone named Jonathan Simmons scored 20 and hit 60% from beyond the arc. Excuse me? I don\u2019t care how efficient the Warriors offense could have been or how well they integrated Durant into their system. Teams that give up 129 points don\u2019t win championships.</p> <p>Also, teams whose highest scoring bench player (Ian Clark!) finishes with five measly points don\u2019t win rings either. Such is life when you sign a top-five player to join your other top-five player and a few top-15 players on your superteam. Their starting lineup might be light years ahead, but their bench is a few hundred parsecs behind. They\u2019re noticeably smaller, too \u2013 lacking many true big men to bang with the superior front court of the Spurs. Zaza Pachulia was a total non-factor and won\u2019t be able to replace the playing time of both Andrew Bogut and Festus Ezeli below the basket. </p> <p>It sounds bad, doesn\u2019t it? It sure looked bad last night, but as every debate show on ESPN and FS1 will tell you the rest of this week, it\u2019s only one game. One game out of 82. You need only look across the country to the Cleveland Cavaliers. Two years ago, they were disappointing the NBA\u2019s salivating chattering class with a stumble out of the gates. One trade reversed their slide, and, if not for injuries to Kevin Love and Kyrie Irving, they might have been hoisting their second championship banner yesterday and not their first.</p> <p>The Cavs took a drastically different Knicks team to the proverbial woodshed last night, then left them in it and locked the door. Oh, and they also burned it down and urinated on the remains. This is a great team, no doubt about it. But this is their third year together. They needed patience to develop into a champion. The same will be required of this Warriors team.</p> <h2>Oh, also, the Spurs are freakin\u2019 awesome</h2> <p>Can we table the Warriors\u2019 premature funeral to discuss that the Spurs are still the Spurs and will always be the Spurs? Early MVP statements were made by LeBron and Damian Lillard, but the most forceful was clearly Kawhi Leonard, who dropped a career-high 35 on Golden State and a true shooting percentage of .634, <a href=\"http://www.basketball-reference.com/boxscores/201610250GSW.html\">per Basketball Reference</a>. The site\u2019s defensive rating for Leonard was 94, which means that he gave up 94 points per 100 possessions on the defensive end. For comparison, the defensive rating for Klay Thompson was 142. And they did all of this with Dewayne Dedmon and David Lee playing over 10 minutes. I foolishly predicted the Spurs would drop to the middle of the pack this year on my NBA podcast, <a href=\"http://roundballrockpod.podbean.com/e/episode-9-lamarcus-aldridge-is-the-becker-of-the-nba/\">Roundball Rock</a>, but any time you doubt the Spurs for even a moment, that just motivates them even more.</p> <p>Why <a href=\"http://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/theres-some-smoke-about-the-spurs-considering-trading-lamarcus-aldridge-but-is-there-fire/\">LaMarcus Aldridge would want to leave this team now</a> is an absolute mystery. If this guy can\u2019t be happy with one of the NBA\u2019s most prestigious, well managed franchises, then maybe this life is not for him. Perhaps he could consider a career in a less stressful profession. Just imagine it: LaMarcus Aldridge, Universal Studios Hollywood tour guide. At least we could finally say we lured LA to LA.</p> <h2>Dame Dolla!</h2> <p>Is Damian Lillard\u2019s rap name the best nickname or the worst nickname in the NBA? Is Damian Lillard a good rapper? Is he better than Shaq? Can we take a rapping basketball player seriously with track names like <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/damianlillard0\">Bill Walton and Growth Spurt</a>? I think I\u2019m convinced. Lillard is a good rapper! As much fun as it would be for Dame Dolla to be as terrible as Metta World Peace\u2019s album My World, it\u2019s not. And, now that the Meet the Hoopers State Farm ad campaign is over and we never have to see Dame in a diaper ever again, I think 2016 is officially the Year of Lillard. He\u2019s my dark horse MVP candidate and I would not be shocked if the Blazers had a better record than the Thunder this season.*</p> <p>(*Let it be known that Damian Lillard is on my fantasy team and I will be irrationally exuberant about him all season, so strap in!)</p> <h2>Tonight\u2019s games remind me of ...</h2> <ul> <li><strong>Miami Heat v Orlando Magic</strong> \u2014 A quiet day on the beach reading a James Patterson novel</li> <li><strong>Dallas Mavericks v Indiana Pacers</strong> \u2014 A throaty, whisky-stained mating call</li> <li><strong>Brooklyn Nets v Boston Celtics</strong> \u2014 White privilege</li> <li><strong>Charlotte Hornets v Milwaukee Bucks</strong> \u2014 Camping.

  "<p>The leading constitutional lawyer George Williams has warned Australia\u2019s campaign finance system is \u201cbroken\u201d \u2013 and he has proposed a major overhaul to ensure the federal system of donations and disclosure is no longer vulnerable to \u201cexploitation\u201d.</p> <p>In a submission to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/sep/15/turnbull-government-launches-sweeping-inquiry-into-donations\">a parliamentary inquiry into the conduct of the last federal election, and the adequacy of Australia\u2019s donations and disclosure regime</a>, Williams proposed a \u201cholistic\u201d overhaul, including imposing caps of $5,000 on political donations, real-time disclosure, banning foreign donations when the source is \u201cexclusively foreign\u201d, caps on campaign expenditure, and a boost to public funding.</p> <p>Williams, the dean of the faculty of law at the University of New South Wales, warned it was \u201cwidely accepted among experts and others that Australia\u2019s system of political finance law is broken and open to exploitation and undue influence\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/sep/23/truth-in-politics-stamping-your-foot-about-cold-blooded-lies-isnt-enough\">Truth in politics: calling out 'cold-blooded lies' isn't nearly enough | Katharine Murphy</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cThis can give rise to a form of soft corruption in which money may be given in return for access and the potential to bring about undue influence on decision-making and policy development,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cSuch a system is clearly not in the interests of the Australian community.\u201d</p> <p>Williams references the two high court cases that are most commonly cited <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/sep/10/australian-political-donations-how-hard-would-it-really-be-to-clean-up\">to make the case that it\u2019s constitutionally difficult to limit donations</a>, and he suggests reform can proceed along the lines he proposes, \u201ctaking into account the legal constraints\u201d.</p> <p>He also used his submission to recommended lowering the voting age to 16, and urged the Turnbull government to resist calls to legislate a truth in political advertising provision.</p> <p>Truth in advertising has been added to the terms of reference for the donations inquiry because that change is being sought by Nick Xenophon. Xenophon was unhappy with some of the advertising directed at his NXT party in South Australia during the 2016 federal election.</p> <p>The Coalition has also complained volubly about Labor\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/jul/07/mediscare-campaign-didnt-worry-my-electorate-says-christopher-pyne\">Medicare anti-privatisation campaign</a> during the campaign.</p> <p>Williams argued there were two main problems with truth in political advertising laws \u2013 the first was the law might prove unworkable in practice and the second was the law could easily infringe the implied freedom of political communication.</p> <p>He acknowledged truth in advertising provisions existed in South Australia, the Northern Territory and in some countries overseas, but he said the regimes were very narrowly based.</p> <p>Williams noted the SA electoral commission wanted the regime repealed on the basis it undermined the independence of the state agency by necessitating decisions about who was right and who was wrong.</p> <p>\u201cWhile it may be possible to frame truth in political advertising laws that are both constitutionally valid and enforceable, any such provisions would have to be cast in very narrow terms with only a small scope for application,\u201d Williams said.</p> <p>\u201cProvisions of this nature would likely serve little more than a symbolic purpose.\u201d</p> <p>He also argued in favour of two changes widening eligibility to vote.</p> <p>The first involved lowering the voting age, which would lower some of the barriers to persuading distracted 18-year-olds to enrol to vote at a time when they are leaving school, and leaving home.</p> <p>\u201cPeople under 18 can leave school, get a job, drive a car and pay taxes. They can also enlist in the Australian defence forces, become a parent, and, in exceptional circumstances, get permission to marry. If the law permits them to undertake these activities, it is hard to see why they cannot also vote.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt is often argued that 16-year-olds lack the knowledge about how government works to enable them to vote ... this can be true, but these problems are not limited to this age group.\u201d</p> <p>Williams said lowering the voting age would not mean imposing a compulsory vote on teenagers. He suggested participation should be voluntary.</p> <p>He also said Australians should be allowed to vote even if they live overseas on a long-term basis. Electoral law prevents people voting if they have resided overseas for six years.</p> <p>\u201cAustralia\u2019s electoral system should recognise the reality that Australia is increasingly integrated into global systems, including by way of movement of its citizens,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cIt is desirable that these people have the opportunity to remain strongly connected to Australia, including by voting.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Striding through the snow-covered fortress, shooting zombies with her bow and arrow, Jordan Belamire felt like a god \u2013 right up until the moment someone named BigBro442 decided to \u201cvirtually rub [her] chest\u201d and make her feel like just another \u201cpowerless woman\u201d. </p> <p>\u201cEven when I turned away from him, he chased me around, making grabbing and pinching motions near my chest,\u201d she wrote in a <a href=\"https://medium.com/athena-talks/my-first-virtual-reality-sexual-assault-2330410b62ee#.8lcy2o2bh\">Medium post</a> of her experience playing QuiVR, a virtual reality game. \u201cEmboldened, he even shoved his hand toward my virtual crotch and began rubbing.\u201d </p> <p>Sexual harassment has been a feature of online and gaming communities from the earliest days of the internet. Until now, the abuse has been largely limited to verbal and visual messages, but as virtual reality technology becomes more immersive, the line between our real bodies and our digital bodies begins to blur.</p> <p>Are we doomed to build virtual worlds that are as hostile to women as the real one?</p> <p>And what will we do when virtual abuse feels as real as a physical assault? </p> <h2>\u2018No bodies touched\u2019</h2> <p>More than two decades ago, Julian Dibbell chronicled the very real emotional fallout from a \u201c<a href=\"http://www.juliandibbell.com/texts/bungle_vv.html\">rape</a>\u201d that took place in a text-based multi-user dimension, known as LambdaMOO. The \u201crape\u201d involved one user hijacking the system to write sentences describing sexual acts involving other users\u2019 avatars. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Emboldened, he even shoved his hand toward my virtual crotch and began rubbing</p> <footer> <cite>Jordan Belamire, QuiVR player</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cNo bodies touched,\u201d Dibbell <a href=\"http://www.juliandibbell.com/texts/bungle_vv.html\">wrote</a> in the Village Voice. And yet, to the victims, the violation was real: \u201cposttraumatic tears were streaming down her face \u2013 a real-life fact that should suffice to prove that the words\u2019 emotional content was no mere playacting.\u201d </p> <p>\u201cIf you highly identify with your avatar and are portraying yourself in an authentic manner, you\u2019re going to feel violated,\u201d said Jesse Fox, an Ohio State University professor who researches the social implications of virtual worlds. \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t be different if someone sent you a harassing email to your work email or harassed you in a chat room.\u201d</p> <p>But Fox warns that virtual reality opens the door to a new level of violation. </p> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s different about virtual environments is an extra layer of immersion. If you are being groped in the real world versus a virtual world, the visual stimuli do not differ,\u201d she said. \u201cYou are seeing it. It is appearing to happen to your own body. Those layers of lifelike experience are going to be more traumatizing in that moment.\u201d </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/oct/02/oculus-rift-palmer-luckey-virtual-reality-donald-trump\">Oculus Rift and the uses and abuses of VR</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In addition, Fox said, virtual reality groping or harassment adds a second level of shock by destroying the user\u2019s sense of immersion in the virtual world. </p> <p>For Belamire, the virtual groping was comparable to being groped in real life \u2013 something that had happened to her twice before.</p> <p>\u201cThe psychological trauma was about equal,\u201d she told the Guardian. \u201cThe shock I felt from real life groping versus that first virtual groping was about the same. You wonder what kind of person thinks it\u2019s OK to do that and are disgusted that it happened to you.\u201d</p> <p>The ability of VR users to harm one another raises all sorts of complex ethical and legal questions. Mark Methenitis, an attorney who has long chronicled issues in video game law, said that society is not yet at the point where virtual assaults should be considered criminal.</p> <p>\u201cMost sexual assault and rape statutes nationwide would require some sort of physical contact. While I admit that VR can give you sensation, to include that within actual assault \u2013 it\u2019s sort of a slippery slope,\u201d he said. </p> <p>\u201cAt the point where people do get actual sensory feedback \u2013 like a Matrix-type plug in \u2026 something where it\u2019s actually plugged into your brain \u2013 that\u2019s where we sort of turn a corner and say that things in virtual reality are much more real than they were before,\u201d he said. \u201cThat line is somewhere out there in the technological ether.\u201d </p> <p>Experiments with haptic technology \u2013 such as a vest that allows a player to feel when their character gets kicked or punched \u2013 might mean that technological ether is closer than we think. </p> <p>\u201cThe willingness for companies to build into haptic spaces makes it more possible for women to be physically assaulted as well as virtually assaulted, which is creepy beyond creepy,\u201d said Fox. </p> <h2>Virtual defenses</h2> <p>While virtual worlds may be vulnerable to the same negative human behaviors that the real world faces, they also include potential solutions that do not exist in real life \u2013 like virtual shields and super powers. </p> <p>When the developers of QuiVR, Aaron Stanton and Jonathan Schenker, learned about Belamire\u2019s experience of harassment, they updated the game\u2019s code to include an expanded \u201cpersonal bubble\u201d that they believe will prevent future gropings.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We ask players to suspend disbelief over their own person \u2026 developers have a responsibility to provide a safe haven</p> <footer> <cite>Aaron Stanton, QuiVR developer</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cI felt irritated and frustrated and helpless on her behalf,\u201d said Stanton. \u201cJust imagining and putting myself in that position \u2013 it lasted with me.\u201d</p> <p>Stanton and Schenker began thinking about ways to address the psychological impacts of being harassed in VR. </p> <p>\u201cVR, unlike other digital experiences, asks the player to give a great deal of control over to the game. We\u2019re asking them to suspend disbelief over their own person,\u201d said Stanton. \u201cI think if you\u2019re going to ask someone to do that, the developers have a great deal of responsibility to provide a safe haven.\u201d</p> <p>The pair came up with the idea of a \u201cpower gesture\u201d \u2013 a physical movement a player can make within the game to activate their personal bubble as if it were a super power.<br></p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s active re-empowerment \u2013 something that they can do to reclaim power for themselves with a strong visual component that clearly transacts power back to them,\u201d Stanton explained. </p> <p>The pair plan to open-source the code for the gesture and are proposing that other developers consider adapting it to their own games. They have written about their proposal for the power gesture as a universal \u201c911\u201d for VR on the industry site <a href=\"http://uploadvr.com/dealing-with-harassment-in-vr/\">UploadVR</a>, and the response so far appears to be positive. </p> <p>\u201cI absolutely love this feature idea \u2026 it is so innovative and powerful,\u201d said Belamire. \u201cGetting too close? Zap, now the harasser has disappeared from my world.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>The US abstained for the first time on Wednesday in a UN vote denouncing the continuing congressional embargo on Cuba. </p> <p>The Obama administration has relaxed some of the half-century-old sanctions on Cuba over the last two years, a process that culminated in a <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2016/mar/22/barack-obama-cuba-cold-war-video\">presidential visit</a> to the Caribbean island state in March and the resumption of commercial flights to Havana. But the Republican-dominated Congress has refused to lift the bulk of the trade restrictions, saying the communist government has not done enough to improve human rights.</p> <p>At a session of the UN general assembly to debate an annual resolution calling for the lifting of the embargo, the US ambassador, Samantha Power, took to the lectern to make the same argument the administration has been making in Congress \u2013 that the embargo has been backfiring for years.</p> <p>\u201cFor more than 50 years, the United States had a policy aimed at isolating the government of Cuba. For roughly half of those years, UN member states have voted overwhelmingly for a general assembly resolution that condemns the US embargo and calls for it to be ended,\u201d <a href=\"https://usun.state.gov/remarks/7510\">Power said</a>.</p> <p>\u201cThe United States has always voted against this resolution. Today the United States will abstain,\u201d the ambassador said, to loud applause in the chamber. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.un.org/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=A/71/L.3\">The resolution</a> was passed by 191 votes, with no votes against and only the US and Israel abstaining, emphasizing congressional isolation on the issue. However, the vote is not legally binding on member states.</p> <p>Explaining the abstention, Power said the administration had called on Congress to lift the embargo but not for the reasons laid out in the UN resolution, which suggests they are in violation of international law. Power said the embargo was legal, but ineffective.</p> <p>\u201c[T]he resolution voted on today is a perfect example of why the US policy of isolation toward Cuba was not working \u2013 or worse, how it was actually undermining the very goals it set out to achieve,\u201d Power said. \u201cInstead of isolating Cuba, as President Obama has repeatedly said, our policy isolated the United States, including right here at the United Nations.\u201d</p> <p>Power stressed that the abstention did not mean that the US \u201cagrees with all of the policies and practices of the Cuban government\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cWe are profoundly concerned by the serious human rights violations that the Cuban government continues to commit with impunity against its own people,\u201d she said. </p> <p>Cuba\u2019s foreign minister, Bruno Rodr\u00edguez, described the abstention as a \u201cpositive step for the future of improving relations between the United States and Cuba\u201d, but noted that most of the sanctions \u201care still in force and are fully implemented today by US government agencies\u201d.</p> <p>Cuba claims that the embargo has caused nearly $5bn in damages to the island over the past year and nearly $126bn since it was first imposed after the 1959 Cuban revolution in what Rodr\u00edguez called \u201ca flagrant violation of international law\u201d.</p>",

  "<p>The statement that follows is highly unfashionable, yet is nonetheless true: one of the things modern Britons can be proudest of is their country\u2019s achievements in international development. Thanks to British aid and development over the last few years, two million more girls are <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/case-studies/helping-girls-get-an-education-in-pakistan\" title=\"\">attending school in Pakistan</a>. With the help of British funding, villagers in the Democratic Republic of Congo will be able to travel to a hospital, using stretches of <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/case-studies/dr-congo-at-50-rebuilding-roads\" title=\"\">1,800km of roads that were previously almost impassable</a>. UK aid has saved the lives of 50,000 women during pregnancy and <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/case-studies/called-to-be-a-midwife-in-northern-nigeria\" title=\"\">250,000 newborn babies</a>.</p> <p>Put simply, British development money has saved, changed and improved millions of lives in the past five years alone. Looking for a&#xa0;field in which the UK is a world-beater? Aid&#xa0;is&#xa0;certainly one. Britain is among a handful of countries to have hit <a href=\"http://www.unmillenniumproject.org/press/07.htm\" title=\"\">the UN\u2019s target</a> of giving 0.7% of its national income <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2015/sep/09/foreign-aid-which-countries-are-the-most-generous\" title=\"\">to overseas development</a>. And the creation in 1997 of the Department for International Development has given Britain a repository of expertise heeded around the world. To find some of his <a href=\"http://www.conservativehome.com/parliament/2016/10/britain-the-soft-power-superpower-of-global-liberalism-boris-johnsons-conservative-conference-speech-full-text.html\" title=\"\">beloved \u201csoft power\u201d</a>, Boris Johnson should trundle a short distance up Whitehall to the DfID offices.</p> <p>It is worth spelling this out, partly because there has been a chorus of protest for months in parts of the media, complaining of \u201c<a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3510811/Stop-foreign-aid-madness-12bn-taxes-splurged-hand-outs-terrorists-killers-care-UK-s-spending-Foreign-Aid-sign-petition-now.html\" title=\"\">foreign aid madness</a>\u201d: a campaign complete with outlandish examples, some \u201csimply incorrect\u201d stories (according to DfID officials) \u2013 and convenient silence on the positive case for spending on aid. Incredibly, the new secretary of state for international development appears to sympathise. Before taking up the job, Priti Patel called for DfID to be shut down. Since moving into the post, she has talked about aid money being squandered. She has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2016/aug/09/priti-patel-new-special-adviser-robert-oxley-critic-uk-foreign-aid-spending-target\" title=\"\">appointed as one of her aides a luminary of the TaxPayers\u2019 Alliance</a>, an organisation that can always be relied on to provide a cheap quote to a Sunday newspaper about some aid \u201cscam\u201d or other. And this week she threatened to cut funding to organisations such as the World Bank. If one of Britain\u2019s proudest recent achievements is its leadership on development, Ms Patel stands on the verge of&#xa0;a massive act of national vandalism.</p> <p>It matters all the more because talks are under way at the OECD in Paris directed at legitimising the diversion of development aid into the private sector. That is not inevitably a bad thing, except that the record of the private sector on schools and healthcare is at the least patchy, and there is not much of a private sector in the very poorest places.</p> <p>Challenged last month by fellow MPs to quantify how much aid money is \u201cstolen or wasted\u201d, Ms Patel could not. She says she wants to spend aid money on the \u201cworld\u2019s poorest people\u201d while also delivering it \u201cin our national interest\u201d, promoting trading relationships. That implies her focus will be on <a href=\"http://www.worldbank.org/en/country/mic\" title=\"\">middle-income countries</a> such as India and China: giant economies with cash to buy British goods and services.</p> <p>It was those countries that her predecessor, Justine Greening, deemed too rich to deserve British aid. In the late 1990s, the UK broke the old corrupt rules which stated that rich countries give poor governments money to buy things (notably arms) from rich countries. That old regime embroiled Britain in scandal and left poor countries with dams and military hardware, no help for ordinary people. Ms&#xa0;Patel appears to hanker for that era.</p> <p>Theresa May is committed to maintain aid spending; Ms Patel is, at the moment, prevented by law from doing trade-for-aid deals. But the positive case for aid is not being made. Unmentioned go the obligations that Britain has to poorer countries, because of the damage it has caused through empire, climate change and pernicious supply chains. Perhaps hamstrung by the lobbying laws or the need to secure their own DfID funding, Oxfam, ActionAid and the like are mutely allowing the new minister and her supporters to trash the case for aid. How best to do development aid is always open to evaluation. That it needs doing should not be. The NGOs must get their act together, fast.</p>",
  "<p>I get it. Sheryl Crow\u2019s call to shorten our presidential cycle will resonate with just about everyone this year. Who isn\u2019t counting down the days until this is over? Even Hillary Clinton has been winding the months in balls.</p> <p>As Crow points out <a href=\"https://www.change.org/p/democratic-national-committee-shorten-the-us-presidential-election-cycle\">in a petition</a> on Change.org, which, as of Wednesday, had more than 40,000 signatures, this extended political circus is a singularly American phenomenon. \u201cThe 2016 election will have lasted nearly 600 days by the time polls close on Nov. 8. By comparison, Canada had its <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/canadas-election-cycle-has-taken-less-than-three-months-and-canadians-are-tired-of-it/2015/10/18/b57ce852-7419-11e5-8d93-0af317ed58c9_story.html\">longest campaign season</a> in recent history last year, and it lasted just 11 weeks,\u201d she writes. \u201cCountries across the globe have limited campaign seasons to as short as 6 weeks. With an organized system, a successful, informative, professional campaign could be run.\u201d</p> <p>Her suggestion for how we reform our electoral process \u2013 that we ask the DNC and RNC to reform the process \u2013 is less compelling. In a segment on Morning Joe on Wednesday, she threw out five days as the optimal amount of time (was she joking?). And she\u2019s previously floated the notion that all 50 states and the District of Columbia should hold their primaries on the same day, a move that would prove hugely advantageous to the richest candidates by short-circuiting grassroots campaigns.</p> <p>The opening clip for <a href=\"http://www.msnbc.com/morning-joe/watch/sheryl-crow-on-why-she-wants-shorter-elections-793881155772\">Crow\u2019s morning segment</a> certainly felt ironic. In it, former British prime minister David Cameron is seen ribbing President Obama about the stupidly long length of American elections. \u201cYou always look on at the American elections in awe of the scale of the process and the length of the process,\u201d <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bPW-wD74Bng\">Cameron says to Obama</a> in a news conference from April of 2016, adding he marvels that anyone is left standing at the end of it. Obama joked back that term limits meant he too would get to sit back and \u201clook in awe\u201d at the process.</p> <p>In retrospect, of course, Cameron might have wanted something different. Two months later he\u2019d be pushed from office over a voter referendum the result of which \u2013 Brexit \u2013 almost nobody saw coming.</p> <p>Crow moved on to how toxic media discourse has become. \u201cThis petition is simply an appeal from a midwestern mom, a single working mom who dives for the remote control before my kids can turn the TV on and see something I\u2019m going to have to explain.\u201d</p> <p>Again the sentiment is relatable but perhaps the problem is less the length of the cycle than the fact our Republican nominee for president actively brags about \u201cgrabbing\u201d women by the \u201cpussy\u201d; a fact which, it\u2019s worth noting, didn\u2019t come out until more than 500 days into the cycle.</p> <p>What Crow deems the \u201cstart\u201d of the election \u2013 Ted Cruz choosing to announce the beginning of his campaign \u2013 is not something the DNC or RNC can actually control. Nor is the fact that campaign reporters often start sourcing up to cover the next campaign the moment the current one ends. Party committees do set the timetable for primaries, but even there they are in a constant tug-of-war with state governments, which battle to move up in the primary calendar so their voters get more attention.</p> <p>As for entreaties to focus more on policy, we may not have gotten as far into the weeds on the tax code or what we need to do to save the environment, but we have furthered the national conversation around racism, xenophobia and, particularly, sexual assault, and those are things that should not be written off as empty identity politics. Since audio leaked of Trump bragging about it on 7 October, a dozen different women have spoken about his alleged sexual misbehavior.</p> <p>That\u2019s not something I want America\u2019s kids watching either. It\u2019s not something I\u2019ve loved covering \u2013 it\u2019s been emotionally and physically exhausting. But it\u2019s more important that voters know who our next president actually is rather than collectively covering their ears.</p> <p>With all due respect, I don\u2019t think Crow understands the value of what journalists have done this cycle. Muting the television won\u2019t protect our kids from our reality. And reducing the amount of time we have to learn about the people running for the most powerful job in the world, particularly when so much of what comes out of their mouths is disinformation, won\u2019t make it harder to fool the American public: it will make it infinitely easier.</p>",

Ghosn has warned that the production of the Nissan Qashqai could move away from Sunderland because of the referendum result.</p> <p>Brexit is not an excuse for multinational companies to use their UK workforce as a bargaining chip. Any goodwill for businesses having to deal with the uncertainty caused by leaving the EU is eroding as they play games with the livelihoods of their staff.<br></p> <p>Despite the referendum result, there are still many reasons for multinational companies to be based in the UK and the City of London. This was proven on Wednesday when Axa Investment Managers announced it would go ahead with construction of the tallest skyscraper in the City, the 62-storey 22 Bishopsgate. The new office building would not be going ahead unless the developers were confident there would be businesses and employees to fill it.</p> <h2>Banks</h2> <p>Brexit \u2013 bank and City regulators want it to be known \u2013 will not lead to any let-up in the rules being imposed on the sector.</p> <p>Andrew Bailey, the newly installed boss of the Financial Conduct Authority, even appeared to suggest on Wednesday that a tough regulatory regime would make London an attractive place to do business. </p> <p>His successor at the Bank of England, where he was deputy governor for prudential regulation, warned bankers at the Mansion House City banquet that financial markets needed robust regulation after the referendum. Sam Woods also told bankers that he wanted them to publish more information about their businesses.</p> <p>Threadneedle Street intends to start publishing information about how much capital banks hold every quarter, and Woods has put them on notice that he is keen for them to publish their regulatory returns. This will stop banks being able to give their own views on their level of bad loans, for instance, and they will be forced to use the standardised definitions set by regulators. </p> <p>As dry as this might sound, it matters.</p> <h2>Panther Securities</h2> <p>The award for business moan of 2016 can be handed to Andrew Perloff, the chairman of property company Panther Securities.</p> <p>Given the fallout from the <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/eu-referendum\">Brexit</a> vote, this was a competitive category this year, but Perloff\u2019s rant about business rates is unbeatable.</p> <p>In a remarkable stock market statement, hecalled the government\u2019s changes to the controversial tax on commercial property as \u201cdisgraceful, sneaky and unfair\u201d. He finished the statement by saying: \u201cIf this is the best they can do on a rates revaluation then I doubt if they could create a profitable hot dog stall outside of Wembley stadium on cup final day, even if they issued themselves the only licence.\u201d</p> <p>Perloff is a Ukip donor and has a history of making colourful public statements, but at least he calls it as he sees it.</p>",
  "<p>The fury subsides. The wounds heal. But as the trumpets and the drums depart, the same Brexit squabbles live on.

Its collapsed heavy industry lies ruined in a hilly landscape. Its politics are equally outdated, socialists battling Marxists. Yet Wallonia\u2019s politicians enjoy astonishing power, since the Belgian federation depends on allowing the province a veto on external treaties. Since the EU holds that a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/21/eu-canada-ceta-trade-deal-meltdown-canadian-minister-walks-out\" title=\"\">trade treaty with Canada</a> requires unanimity of its 28 states, Wallonia\u2019s veto is Belgium\u2019s veto. Wallonia is the mouse that roars.</p> <p>Those wondering what this means for Brexit should read the history of Canada\u2019s dealings with the EU. Ten years ago, a <a href=\"http://business.financialpost.com/news/economy/ceta-the-canary-in-the-coalmine-of-international-free-trade\" title=\"\">previous deal was wrecked by Canada</a>, not by Belgium, when Quebec dairy farmers cast a veto and left the EU\u2019s negotiators fuming. <a href=\"http://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/international-business/european-business/explainer-ceta-wallonia-europe-and-canada/article32489554/\" title=\"\">Now it is the turn of Wallonia\u2019s dairy farmers to call a halt</a>.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/24/eu-trade-deal-with-canada-collapses-as-belgium-refuses-to-sign\">EU trade deal with Canada on brink of collapse after Belgian disarray</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Trade deals are the lowest form of diplomatic life. The currently abortive Canadian treaty is a glutinous mess of beef hormones, investor protection, Romanian visas, patent term regulations and cheese definitions. <a href=\"http://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/rob-commentary/eu-should-have-told-canada-years-ago-it-was-moving-the-ceta-goal-posts/article32463376/\" title=\"\">The EU shot itself in the foot by declaring, late in the day, that the deal was subject to member unanimity, not majority voting</a>. Canadian lawyers find this interpretation strange to the point of suspicion. It did not apply to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/sep/30/eu-gives-green-light-to-activate-paris-climate-deal\" title=\"\">Paris climate change treaty</a>.</p> <p>To leftwing Walloons, the EU may be in hock to monopoly capitalism. To British \u201chard Brexiters\u201d, it is the opposite, a Trojan horse for socialist bureaucracy and external control. To the latter, the Wallonian fiasco proves only how useless the EU has become. If it wants a trade deal with post-Brexit Britain, it should set its house in order and then come cap in hand to London. Otherwise, Britain should shake hands with Canada and others round the world, and let Europe stew in its own juice.</p> <p>So far, so noble. I can see Boris Johnson and Liam Fox stomping the Ardennes, arm-in-arm with Walloon Marxists in defence of plucky little Belgium. Theirs is a coalition of the last stand against the heartless armies of the EU. What a contrast with the leaders of Britain\u2019s Wallonias, Scotland and Wales, who last week <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/24/brexit-strategy-scotland-wales-northern-ireland-direct-line-david-davis-theresa-may\" title=\"\">traipsed to Downing Street</a>, pleading for Brexit mercy from Theresa May. If Wallonia could stop Europe in its tracks, what about the equally oppressed tribes of the Celtic fringe? They got a flea in the ear.</p> <p>The Wallonian saga shows only the power of provincial lobbyists in ruling the terms of trade, both within and outside the EU. No one can seriously applaud the licence granted to the Walloons to shut out the Canadians. Even in Brexit Britain, leavers and remainers alike favoured free trade. Their chief argument was over \u201ctrade in what, and with whom?\u201d</p> <p>That argument at least is starting to clear. On intra-European migration, May will be forced to concede virtually an open door to bankers, doctors, care workers, fruit pickers and other businesses dependent on foreign labour. It is simply not feasible to erect visa barriers round the UK\u2019s borders, whether along the Channel coast or around Fermanagh and Tyrone. Whatever May says, Brexit is unlikely to make much difference to migration statistics. Her leadership should start lowering expectations.</p> <p>On trade in manufactured goods, the&#xa0;totals at stake are small, but not so for the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/2ce78f36-ed2e-11e5-888e-2eadd5fbc4a4\" title=\"\">80% of businesses that are services</a> and particularly affected by <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/249969/TaskForce-report-15-October.pdf#page=17\" title=\"\"> non-tariff barriers</a>. While the EU market in services remains embryonic, to stay must be in Britain\u2019s interest. Everyone wants access to markets. Everyone accepts, and May concedes, that this means give and take. Give involves a surrender of control. There is no such thing as absolute sovereignty.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Political Europe is in the process of decline, if not disintegration</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>In June the British voted narrowly to leave the EU. Barring a revolution, that will plainly happen. But beyond \u201cleaving\u201d, all is pollster conjecture. \u201cHard\u201d Brexit posits some EU relationship along Canadian lines. But even if a deal with Britain may be treated as more urgent, Wallonia shows how pressure groups can damage the public interest. In Britain\u2019s case, transitional \u201cdefault to World Trade Organisation\u201d tariffs would be costly to the economy and, on the Irish border, unenforceable.</p> <p>Any Brexit cloud has a silver lining. Taking the heat out of London\u2019s banking frenzy may be no bad thing. Devaluation can ease the strain of tariffs. Pending a storm of Wallonias \u2013 Germans on banking, the Dutch on pigs, half the EU on car assembly \u2013 ad hoc deals may be reached. But a cloud it would surely be. In the short term, there would be a net loss of business. Hence I cannot see how hard Brexit is in the nation\u2019s interest, political or economic. The virtue of the residual <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/eu-eea\" title=\"\">European economic area</a> (EEA) \u2013 some version of the so-called Norway option \u2013 is that it would take Britain out of the EU politically, but leave in place a common market. Trade in goods and services would remain, but at the price of their regulation, and that would have to be paid for.</p> <p>Political Europe is in the process of decline, if not disintegration. As refugees, bank bailouts, recession and unemployment all testify, the EU and especially the eurozone are not a functioning confederation but a zone of German influence. Britain has decided to distance itself from that zone. It cannot divorce itself from the economy of its entire continent. Caution and common sense advise the EEA, \u201csoft\u201d Brexit.</p> <p>Meanwhile, do not mock the Walloons. Their flexing of political muscle reflects a widespread identity crisis among all the world\u2019s subordinate regions. From Scotland to Spain, from Ukraine to Turkey to Syria to the Gulf, the greatest threat to global stability \u2013 and its ally free trade \u2013 is sub-national separatism. The rebellion of local peoples against centralist power is everywhere.</p> <p>As Brexit stumbles forward, May should read the lessons of Wallonia. She&#xa0;should appease the Scots and others by granting them status in her impending negotiations. She is a remainer at heart. She may welcome a Wallonian card in her hand.</p>",

What they may not do is provide a service that only reflects their own political or religious message in relation to sexual orientation.\u201d</p> <p>To go against this simple summary of the law would put us back to a time when landlords had signs in their windows saying \u201cno blacks, no Irish, no&#xa0;dogs\u201d.</p> <p>I am disappointed that a Guardian leader writer can seek to defend the indefensible with such a convoluted non-argument.<br><strong>Dorothy Smith</strong><br><em>Welwyn Garden City, Hertfordshire</em></p> <p>\u2022 I am disappointed that the Guardian cannot see the difference between \u201cSupport gay marriage\u201d and \u201cSave Ulster from sodomy\u201d. The first is a positive message which, whether you agree with it or not, oppresses no one. The second asserts falsely that the existence of a sexual minority threatens \u201cUlster\u201d, implying that they must be discriminated against or suppressed. It was the slogan of a campaign to keep homosexuality illegal in Ulster and gave legitimacy to all sorts of attacks on gay people.</p> <p>Secondly, the cake bakers were not having their freedom of expression infringed. No one was stopping them baking a cake with the message \u201cDon\u2019t support gay marriage\u201d. Also, no one would have thought that the bakers supported gay marriage, any more than the message \u201cMan U for the cup\u201d would have meant that they supported Manchester United.</p> <p>The gay couple had the right to express their views and the cake bakers offered a forum for this \u2013 until someone came along with a message they disagreed with.

  "<p>Six extremists or terror suspects are now subject to official counter-terror orders that include being relocated from their home towns or cities, the Home Office has revealed.</p> <p>The confirmation that there are six orders covering terror prevention and investigation measures (Tpims) in force marks a revival in their use after three years in which no more than one or two individuals have been subject to the orders.</p> <p>The Tpim regime, which replaced counter-terror control orders, can include a range of measures including enforced curfews of up to 10 hours, tagging, requiring a person to live up to 200 miles from their current address and restrictions on overseas travel. They last for up to two years and are the toughest tool the security services can use against people they believe to be involved in terrorism but who cannot be prosecuted or deported.</p> <p>The Home Office said five of the six current Tpim suspects are British. The orders were thought to have largely fallen into disuse since December 2013 when eight Tpims were in force. Their revival coincides with the return to Britain of jihadi fighters from Syria.</p> <p>A Home Office review of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/nov/21/counter-terrorism-bill-internal-exile-suspect-lib-dems-clegg\">use of Tpims</a> , published on Wednesday, said: \u201cIn the five years since the act received royal assent, Tpim notices have been and remain a crucial component of the government\u2019s national security response. </p> <p>\u201cThe threat the UK continues to face from terrorism is serious, complex and sustained. While prosecution and conviction of those individuals suspected of terrorism-related activity remains the government\u2019s priority, the act continues to provide appropriate, proportionate and effective powers for dealing with the risk posed by a small number of people in this country who are assessed to pose a terrorism-related threat to the public.\u201d </p> <p>The assessment was part of a post-legislative scrutiny of the regime demanded by parliament when Tpims replaced control orders in 2011.</p>",

One of Beryl's most striking pictures - Did You Think I would Leave You Dying When There's Room on my Horse for Two - captures the moment when Beryl's mother-in-law tried to shoot her, a scene that also figures in The Bottle Factory Outing, but the two representations are completely different, have a very different artistic purpose and invoke very different responses in the reader/viewer.</p></div> </div> </div>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-58134ac9e4b0219a00d399ac\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-28T12:56:44.871Z\">1.56pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/4775239\">JudeTheExplicit</a> asks:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I found a sort of iconoclastic glee at work in Harriet Said (&amp; Master Georgie / Young Adolf etc) which I really enjoyed.

You could also argue that An Awfully Big Adventure or A Quiet Life or the Dressmaker, being set in the 1940s and 1950s were more appropriate vehicles for any feelings of nostalgia she might have had, rather than novels set in the far past. She would often say she started writing historical novels becuase she had used up her own past, but if you read my biography it is clear that isn't true and that she didn't write about many experiences which many people would consider important in their lives. From the eighties onwards, she couldn't really write about her present day emotional life, because she had begun an affair with her publisher, Colin Haycraft. Instead she used 'historical' fiction to write about emotional situations and the things close to her, but presented it at one remove, through the veil of historical characters and a historical situation.</p></div> </div> </div>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-581345d4e4b0219a00d39993\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-28T12:35:20.224Z\">1.35pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/669781\">samjordison </a>asks:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I guess I should ask the question about the Booker prize...

And did Bainbridge believe that Anna Haycraft\u2019s editing role was central to Bainbridge\u2019s development as a novelist?</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-comment\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/live/2016/oct/26/brendan-king-beryl-bainbridge-biographer-live-webchat#comment-86352712\">  <div class=\"d2-comment-embedded\" itemscope itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Comment\"> <div class=\"d2-left-col\"> <a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/16840088\" title=\"View Brendan_M_King\u2019s profile\"> <img class=\"d2-avatar\" src=\"https://avatar.guim.co.uk/user/16840088\" height=\"40\" width=\"40\" alt=\"User avatar for Brendan_M_King\"> </a> <span class=\"d2-badge d2-badge-contributor d2-hidetext\" title=\"Guardian contributor\" itemprop=\"jobTitle\">Guardian contributor</span> </div> <div class=\"d2-right-col\"> <div itemscope itemprop=\"author\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\"> <a class=\"d2-username\" href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/16840088\" title=\"View Brendan_M_King\u2019s profile\" itemprop=\"url\"> <span itemprop=\"givenName\">Brendan_M_King</span> </a> </div> <div class=\"d2-permalink\"> <a class=\"d2-datetime\" href=\"https://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/86352712\" title=\"Link to this comment\" itemprop=\"datePublished\">28 October 2016 1:19pm</a> </div> <div class=\"d2-body\" itemprop=\"text\"><p>Your question seems to be suggesting that the friendship between the two women in The Bottle Factory Outing is a depiction of Beryl's friendship with Alice Thomas Ellis (Anna Haycraft), but this is not the case. In the novel Freda was based on a friend Beryl knew during the 1970s called Pauline. As for Beryl's friendship with Anna it was nothing if not complicated, and a brief outline of the way in which the two women's lives intersected at various points over the years explains why (for fuller details see either the biography itself or the Guardian review of it). In the early 1970s Anna was certainly influential in encouraging Beryl in her writing career, though it was her husband Colin who did the hand-on editing of the texts. The relationship between the Haycrafts and Beryl was a symbiotic one - Duckworth benefitted from Beryl's early critical success, and Beryl benefitted as a writer from their joint input and encouragement. When Anna started writing novels herself (it is a moot point whether Anna would have started writing if it hadn't been for Beryl's example) this added another layer of complexity to their relationship, and the fact that around the same time Beryl began an affair with Colin obviously muddies the water still further. By the time I came on the scene Anna's role as editor was a fairly hand-off one - she would read the opening chapter and make comments, but then she wouldn't see the book until it was finished. I don't think Beryl could read Anna's work neutrally as works of fiction - it would have been impossible for her not to see the situation between herself, Anna and Colin reflected in the characters and plots of Anna's books.</p></div> </div> </div>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-58134312e4b08d944ba4b9a3\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-28T12:24:04.109Z\">1.24pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p> <a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/16064333\">machenbach </a>asks:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Two questions:</p> <p>When translating Huysmans, do you use any of the previous English editions at all?

A mixture of both. I produce a version directly from the French so that I get something that I think is correct, and then once I have a rough draft I will go through other translations to see where we differ as to meaning or expression. As for the 1931 edition of Against the Grain its publishing history is a bit too involved to go into here. I treat it in more depth on my Huysmans site - this page should answer your questions://<a href=\"http://www.huysmans.org/fortune.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.huysmans.org/fortune.htm</a>. Later Fortune Press editions of the book are slightly bowdlerised. <br />2 As far as Beryl's choice of novels was concerned sometimes one thing just leads to another. She had worked at the Playhouse and hadn't written about that period/experience so that was a partial impetus for An Awfully Big Adventure, and during the writing of that novel - which centered around a performance of Peter Pan - she found out that one of the last letters Captain Scott had written before his death had been to James Barrie, and this piqued her interest in the Pole, which she had already been interested in having read The Worst Journey in the World. The fact that the Titanic sank in the same year as Scott and his men were found frozen in their tent prompted the idea of writing about the sinking of the ship in Every Man for Himself. The inspiration for Watson's Apology started from an article written by Mervyn Horder, the former owner of Duckworth, Beryl's publisher. Her interest in the story's potential was given further impetus by Colin Haycraft, who took over the running of Duckworth from Horder, as he encouraged her to write a novel about it, and did some preliminary research for it. Ultimately though, the reasons why an author chooses to write one particular novel rather than another is never entirely explainable.</p></div> </div> </div>  </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-10-28T12:25:08.982Z\">at 1.25pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-581341c0e4b08d944ba4b9a0\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-28T12:17:39.330Z\">1.17pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/2955975\">palfreyman </a>asks:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Another question, if I may...</p> <p>I have not read your biography of Bainbridge (forgive me, I can afford about one book a month and we have no public libraries round my way), so I am sure this is answered in that, but...</p> <p>Why did she need an amanuensis?</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-comment\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/live/2016/oct/26/brendan-king-beryl-bainbridge-biographer-live-webchat#comment-86351467\">  <div class=\"d2-comment-embedded\" itemscope itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Comment\"> <div class=\"d2-left-col\"> <a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/16840088\" title=\"View Brendan_M_King\u2019s profile\"> <img class=\"d2-avatar\" src=\"https://avatar.guim.co.uk/user/16840088\" height=\"40\" width=\"40\" alt=\"User avatar for Brendan_M_King\"> </a> <span class=\"d2-badge d2-badge-contributor d2-hidetext\" title=\"Guardian contributor\" itemprop=\"jobTitle\">Guardian contributor</span> </div> <div class=\"d2-right-col\"> <div itemscope itemprop=\"author\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\"> <a class=\"d2-username\" href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/16840088\" title=\"View Brendan_M_King\u2019s profile\" itemprop=\"url\"> <span itemprop=\"givenName\">Brendan_M_King</span> </a> </div> <div class=\"d2-permalink\"> <a class=\"d2-datetime\" href=\"https://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/86351467\" title=\"Link to this comment\" itemprop=\"datePublished\">28 October 2016 1:03pm</a> </div> <div class=\"d2-body\" itemprop=\"text\"><p>One reason was that Beryl was not the most technically minded of people and she needed help with the various practical and techical aspects of being a writer - dealing with a word processor and a computer operating system before the universal ease-of-use philosophy of Macs and Windows. There were floppy disks to be fiddled with, printers to be maintained, articles to be faxed and so on. Another reason was that just before I began working for her she had started writing a column for the London Evening Standard, which brought her an audience that was many orders larger than the one that knew her as a novelist. Consequently she was asked to do more things and received more post and telephone messages. My role, at least initially, was to help her get on top of the accumulation of demands on her time so that she could concentrate on actually writing novels.</p></div> </div> </div>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5813416ee4b01c528432d9a6\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-28T12:16:31.101Z\">1.16pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/2955975\">palfreyman </a>asks:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Dear Brendan</p> <p>Many thanks for coming here to join us.</p> <p>I only read my first Bainbridge (The Bottle Factory Outing) two days ago when my copy arrived.</p> <p>I will confess to finding, as so many others did, both Brenda and Freda to be dislikeable: prejudiced, racist fantasists with little or no real humanity in them.</p> <p>And yet people keep saying they represent aspects of Bainbridge\u2019s own life and personality.</p> <p>Having known her, do you feel that, particularly when she was younger, she may have suffered from self-loathing or shame?

In general I steered clear of trying to use incidents in Beryl's novels as proof of, or illustrations of, events from her real life because while her experiences certainly fed into her fiction I don't think there is a one-to-one relationship between the two. In the novel certain of Brenda's life experiences resemble Beryl's, but what is left out of the novel would have been just as significant to Beryl at the time, if not more so, than what was put in. This has no bearing on the book's quality as a piece of fiction, but it would obviously be misleading to try and read her fiction as a guide to the events of her life or her state of mind. For example, in the early 1970s she had come out of a relationship with the painter Don McKinlay which certainly affected her deeply on an emotional level, but this is barely touched on or gone into in the novel. Also as a single mother at the time, a lot of Beryl's life would have been tangled up in trying to balance her own emotional life and bringing up three children, but again this aspect of her life is completely absent from the book. <br />As for Freda, she was loosely based on a friend of Beryl's called Pauline, but again the parallels cannot be made absolutely explicit - Beryl and Pauline never lived together for example, as Brenda and Freda do in the book, and, like Beryl, Pauline was also a mother, so again a whole area of Pauline/Freda's life is expunged for the sake of the novel's plot line.</p></div> </div> </div>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-581340a4e4b0219a00d39980\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-28T12:13:52.319Z\">1.13pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/15106370\">lljones </a> asks:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Is it <em>really </em>incomplete?

Rivellino swiftly moved the ball further down the wing to Jairzinho, who cut inside to draw in two opponents before sliding the ball across to Pel\u00e9, who was just outside the penalty box.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/oct/25/carlos-alberto-dies-brazil-captain\">Pel\u00e9 and Franz Beckenbauer lead tributes to \u2018brother\u2019 Carlos Alberto</a> </p> </aside>  <p>As the move built up to a thrilling crescendo, Pel\u00e9 sensed Carlos Alberto crashing in on the overlap from his right-back position, and waited for a crucial half-second to deliver a perfectly weighted pass to his skipper. Carlos Alberto hit the ball so hungrily and with such power that both feet came off the ground, yet he lost no control in doing so, and his shot flew with absolute accuracy across the angle and along the ground into the bottom left-hand corner of the goal, giving the goalkeeper no chance. It was a joyous, tear-welling, celebratory finish to a marvellous game, and was testimony to the ability of that Brazilian side to raise football to an art form.</p> <p>\u201cI realise how beautiful and how important that goal was, because everybody is still talking about it,\u201d he<a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/world_cup_2006/teams/brazil/4759831.stm\"> told the BBC many years later</a>. \u201cNobody talks about Pel\u00e9\u2019s goal, the first goal, the second goal. It is always about the fourth goal. I think it was the best goal ever scored in a World Cup.\u201d</p> <p>Carlos Alberto Torres was born in Rio de Janeiro, and joined the city\u2019s Fluminense team at the age of 19, in 1963. Though a defender, he immediately caught the eye with the range of his play \u2013 including his reading of the game, leadership skills, dribbling, ball control and passing. Those all-round abilities won him the first of his 53 Brazil caps within a year, yet to general surprise he was not picked for the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/jul/24/1966-world-cup-final-conspiracy-refereeing-50-years\">1966 World Cup</a> squad. Brazil\u2019s gifted team were knocked out of the 1966 finals in the group stages, after which a new managerial regime not only brought Carlos Alberto back into the fold, but, judging that a collection of strong-willed players needed greater direction and backbone, chose him as captain with a brief to put the team back on track.</p> <p>That he did, in spades, delivering the 1970 World Cup at the age of 25 in a tournament celebrated for some superb football and competed for by a number of excellent sides, including England, West Germany and Italy. Carlos Alberto could not, however, follow up with the 1974 World Cup, which he missed due to a bad knee injury, and though at 32 he was again selected as captain of Brazil in the qualifiers for the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/quiz/2011/jun/14/1\">1978 World Cup</a>, he had to move to centre-half to compensate for a loss of speed, and decided to retire from international football before the finals, having played only five matches for his country since 1970.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/jun/09/-sp-a-century-of-the-selecao-the-remarkable-story-of-brazilian-football\">A century of the Sele\u00e7\u00e3o: the remarkable story of Brazilian football</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Domestically, after three years and almost 100 appearances at Fluminense, he had left his home city to join Pel\u00e9 at Santos in 1966, playing more than 400 games there before 1974, when he returned to Fluminense for a successful three-year stint. After a brief period with the Rio club Flamengo, in 1977 he made a lucrative move to the US to sign for New York Cosmos, where Pel\u00e9 was also playing. Apart from a short fling with the California Surf team, Carlos Alberto remained with the Cosmos from 1977 to 1982, winning three North American Soccer League titles before retiring there.</p> <p>Within a year he was back in Brazil, managing Flamengo. He lasted two years in that job, and over the next two decades there followed head coach posts with 15 other teams, including Fluminense, Miami Sharks in the US, and, on the international scene, Oman and latterly Azerbaijan, where he finished his managerial career in 2005.</p> <p>On his death Carlos Alberto was living in Rio, where he was still working as an entertaining and forthright sports commentator who rarely held back on his assessment of players or the game in general.</p> <p>He is survived by his third wife, Gra\u00e7a Garbaccio, and by two children, Alexandre (a former footballer who made a single appearance for Brazil, in 1992) and Andr\u00e9a, from his first marriage.</p> <p>\u2022 Carlos Alberto Torres, footballer, born 17 July 1944; died 25 October 2016</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 28 October 2016.

The other thing we shouldn\u2019t underestimate is a generation of families who are now going to see this impact with their children. It feels like a tip of an iceberg that we\u2019ve seen in terms of the devastation on those children and their families.\u201d</p> <p>The two philanthropic organisations, together with the Brazilian, US and UK governments, have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/26/mosquitos-infected-wolbachia-bacteria-zika-virus\">announced $18m (\u00a314.7m) funding for an ambitious project</a> to release mosquitoes infected with Wolbachia bacteria in two urban areas of Brazil and Colombia. The bacteria renders the mosquitoes unable to transmit viruses. They breed with local mosquitoes, producing offspring with Wolbachia, a bacteria carried by 60% of insects that is harmless to humans.<br></p> <p>If it works, it will help limit not just Zika but also other flaviviruses, including dengue and yellow fever.</p> <p>There is a lot that is still not understood, including the human response to infection and what may happen in Africa, where Zika has been detected in the past, which means there may be a background level of immunity, explained Farrar. In the long run, he said, to end the threat will require not just Wolbachia \u2013 if it really does work at scale, about which he said he is \u201cin equipoise\u201d \u2013 but a vaccine as well.</p> <p>Zika, and <a href=\"http://www.who.int/csr/disease/ebola/en/\">before it Ebola</a>, have driven home to the scientific community that technology is not the whole answer to pandemics. The Gates Foundation, in London hosting its <a href=\"http://grandchallenges.org/\">Grand Challenges</a> meeting, where scientists are invited to bid for funding for innovative solutions to global problems, has moved from what was once perceived as a very hi-tech and scientific focus to a much broader outlook.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"72ca8cbe96b0e10cfee0fa2d6e5f5db48ebdf4e0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/72ca8cbe96b0e10cfee0fa2d6e5f5db48ebdf4e0/0_248_5145_3087/1000.jpg\" alt=\"An adult female mosquito is seen under a microscope in a laboratory in Guangzhou, China\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">An adult female mosquito is seen under a microscope in a laboratory in Guangzhou, China.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kevin Frayer/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cWe definitely like to get our geek on, as people talk about it,\u201d said Desmond-Hellmann. \u201cWe love data, we love science, we love technology. But increasingly one of the exciting things in science and technology is what people call implementation science and social science. It is at anyone\u2019s peril if they think they\u2019re going to make a difference in the world and not deeply understand that aspect of the work.\u201d</p> <p>With Ebola, it was vital to understand the cultural traditions surrounding death and burial. With Zika, the Gates Foundation is very concerned about access to family planning, an issue it has made a global priority.</p> <p>Both Gates and Wellcome believe the world is moving in the right direction on pandemic preparedness. They point to good collaboration and the sharing of ideas between many organisations. The much criticised World Health Organisation (WHO) has, they say, an invaluable role in standard-setting, while philanthropic organisations, government, NGOs and industry are all talking and influencing each other. </p> <p>\u201cI believe we are going in the right direction. There is almost universal consensus,\u201d said Farrar. </p> <p>Increasing urbanisation, trade and travel will mean pandemics continue to happen. There needs to be sustained investment in public health \u2013 \u201cthe first line of defence for the world\u201d, said Farrar \u2013 and there needs to be commitment to research and development, both in technologies and the social sciences. Desmond-Hellmann added surveillance to that list \u2013 an area in which her <a href=\"http://www.gatesfoundation.org/Media-Center/Press-Releases/2015/05/Child-Health-and-Mortality-Prevention-Surveillance-Network\">foundation is investing heavily</a>, so that \u201cthe world has what it needs for an early read-out\u201d when disease outbreaks occur. All agree that strengthening health systems is vital.</p> <p>At the London meeting, Priti Patel, the UK\u2019s international development secretary, announced her department would continue to invest 3% of its budget on research, amounting to \u00a3390m a year for the next four years.

  "<p>Last winter First Unitarian Congregational Society in Brooklyn, where I serve as senior minister, voted to hang a Black Lives Matter banner outside our building. Shortly after we hung the banner it mysteriously disappeared. We replaced it and the replacement disappeared as well. This kept happening. For months the thief was silent; there was no inkling of motive. Every Monday we would post a banner or sign, and every Sunday night, it would be removed. Then, last week, we found something new: next to the Black Lives Matter sign appeared a sign that read: \u201cBlue Lives Matter.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>In the history of oppressed groups demanding equality, an equivalent of the 'Blue Lives Matter' sign goes up every time</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>As a pastor, I first need to acknowledge the pain behind this protest of our protest. Someone who loves a police officer (or who <em>is</em> a police officer) feels under attack. Indeed, police are killed in the line of duty \u2013 most recently the tragedy in Palm Springs that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/08/three-police-officers-shot-palm-springs-california\">killed two officers</a>, one about to retire and the other a new mother just back from maternity leave. Police have dangerous jobs \u2013 willingly undertaken \u2013 and deserve great honor and gratitude for their service. We would all agree with the sign, that the lives of police matter. </p> <p>Except that it\u2019s not that simple. To post a \u201cBlue Lives Matter\u201d sign next to \u2013 and in response to \u2013 a Black Lives Matter sign is not only to equate importance of police and black lives, it is to equate the <em>need</em> for the two signs. It is to say that the value of police officers\u2019 lives needs proclamation just as urgently as that of black lives at this moment in history. It is to suggest that police as a class are targets of discrimination, humiliation, and violence on a par with people of color. To suggest this is to muddy the waters. There is no comparison. One third of all policemen are not incarcerated at some point in their lifetime; police do not earn wages 26% lower than their non-police counterparts; police do not need to sit their sons down for \u201cthe talk\u201d, praying desperately that they be safe from police violence \u2026 unless, of course, their sons are black.</p> <p>It is a central function of a democracy to protect the rights of the oppressed and the disenfranchised. But our ability to do that hinges on our ability to know \u2013 who exactly <em>are</em> the oppressed and disenfranchised? And who are the powerful? In this political season, when a straight, white, male billionaire can claim with a straight face that the system is rigged against him, it can be hard to know. And so the Black Lives Matter movement is shining a spotlight on the particular horror of racism today \u2013 especially the disproportionate violence inflicted on black men by the law enforcement and criminal justice systems. </p> <p>Look at the history of oppressed groups demanding equality, and you find that an equivalent of the \u201cBlue Lives Matter\u201d sign goes up every time. No sooner was gay marriage affirmed by the supreme court than \u201creligious freedom\u201d bills sprung up nationwide protecting anti-gay discrimination. No sooner were Jim Crow laws were abolished than New York State passed mandatory minimum sentencing for the possession of <em>certain</em> drugs. No sooner did we nominate the first woman candidate for president than we nominated the most flaming misogynist ever to run. These are not coincidences. They are classic backlash, sometimes violent, but often couched in genteel rhetoric that positions the dominant group as the <em>actual</em> victim. It is this false appropriation of victimhood that is most insidious. It gaslights the entire nation. It re-silences people just as they come out of silence. </p> <p>We took down the \u201cBlue Lives Matter\u201d sign. And it was not because police lives don\u2019t matter. It was because this movement is not about police lives or any other worthy lives that also matter. It is specifically about the lives of black people \u2013 black mothers and fathers and children, teachers and attorneys, prisoners and the homeless, and yes, black police officers. To proclaim that these lives matter is to try to still the shifting sands for just a moment; to utter one simple, unassailable truth on behalf of those whose truths have been pulled out from under their feet time and again.</p>",
  "<p>My father, Dimitri Petrohilos, who has died aged 81, was an architect and furniture designer.</p> <p>The son of an architect, George Petrohilos, and his wife, Elli (nee Georgiadis), Dimitri was born in Athens. His family lived in their cellar when the German army occupied their home during the second world war. After the war, they settled in Tanzania, where Dimitri rode camels, rallied cars, hunted in the bush and crash-landed a Tiger Moth, in a tree. He created his first building, a church, with his father.</p> <p>After taking a sculpture course in Florence, Dimitri applied widely to study architecture and in 1953 went to the University of Cincinnati. He revelled in all that 1950s America had to offer a handsome Greek in a pink zoot suit. He travelled through Mexico to Cuba, where he recalled meeting Fidel Castro; he also ran into Elvis Presley at Radio City in New York, he told us. An outspoken and avid reader of communist material, he came to the attention of the House Un-American Activities Committee and in 1955 left the US, initially for Canada.</p> <p>In 1956 he returned to his family in Dar es Salaam and joined his father\u2019s firm. Four years later, he moved to London to study at the Architectural Association and work for Booty Edwards &amp; Partners. Using his expertise honed in the tropics, he was the project architect on the new Standard Chartered Bank headquarters in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, an elegant concrete building that towered above the developing city but is now dwarfed by its neighbours.</p> <p>Returning to Tanzania in the late 60s he worked for the architecture consultancy firm Norman and Dawbarn, where, among many other buildings, he designed Nkrumah Hall for the University of Dar es Salaam.

In the mid-60s he founded Adeptus, initially with a studio and shop in Primrose Hill, north London, then on Tottenham Court Road and elsewhere in London, and also sold in the US.

  "<p>Thanks to the Affordable Care Act, more Americans have health insurance today than ever before \u2013 <a href=\"https://aspe.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/pdf/187551/ACA2010-2016.pdf\">20 million</a> more than in 2010. The news this week that Obamacare insurance premiums are going up an average 25% may seem worrisome, but many insurers had initially underestimated costs and set rates <a href=\"http://kff.org/health-reform/perspective/how-aca-marketplace-premiums-measure-up-to-expectations/\">lower</a> than the Congressional Budget Office had projected. We\u2019re now seeing a correction. </p> <p>That said, the ACA hasn\u2019t been an unqualified success. Many poor and middle-class Americans still don\u2019t have access to affordable health insurance. The Obamacare experiment may finally prove that there\u2019s only so much market-based solutions can do.<br></p> <p>One of the most popular measures under the ACA was to bar insurance companies from denying someone coverage due to a pre-existing health condition, such as pregnancy, asthma, diabetes, heart disease, cancer or depression. <a href=\"http://kff.org/health-reform/perspective/september-kaiser-health-tracking-poll-pre-existing-conditions/\">More than half of Americans</a> say that they or someone in their household has a pre-existing condition. Some of these folks get insurance coverage through their job. Others are poor or disabled or old enough to qualify for Medicaid or Medicare. But before the ACA, the rest faced sky-high premiums if they could get insurance at all. </p> <p>Because insurers could deny coverage to people with pre-existing conditions, they could sell insurance to the rest of us relatively cheaply. That\u2019s because they were selling insurance to healthy people who wouldn\u2019t use a lot of health services. Insurers underestimated just how sick those signing up for the Obamacare plans would be, and that\u2019s a key reason costs and premiums are going up now. And even though premiums on Obamacare plans are going up, it\u2019s not as much as you\u2019d think. Employer-sponsored health insurance is still <a href=\"http://www.urban.org/sites/default/files/2000931-are-nongroup-marketplace-premiums-really-high-not-in-comparison-with-employer-insurance.pdf\">more expensive</a>.</p> <p>But just because Obamacare insurance premiums are going up doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019ll pay more. <a href=\"https://aspe.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/pdf/212721/2017MarketplaceLandscapeBrief25.pdf\">Eight out of 10</a> Americans buying insurance on <a href=\"http://www.healthcare.gov\">Healthcare.gov</a> will still be able to get coverage for under $100 per month. That\u2019s because Americans who make between 100% and 400% of the <a href=\"https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2016/01/25/2016-01450/annual-update-of-the-hhs-poverty-guidelines\">Federal Poverty Level</a> (between $24,300 and $97,200 for a family of four in 2016) \u2013 <a href=\"https://aspe.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/pdf/212721/2017MarketplaceLandscapeBrief25.pdf\">85%</a> of those buying an Obamacare plan \u2013 are eligible for a tax credit. These tax credits go up if insurance premiums go up, so your out-of-pocket costs stay about the same.</p> <p>But there are some clear losers under Obamacare. You will face a big premium hike if you buy your own insurance and make too much to be eligible for a tax credit (mostly small business owners and their employees) or if you\u2019re eligible for a tax credit but choose to shop for insurance outside the Obamacare marketplace (an estimated 2.5 million people). And if you\u2019re one of the 4 million poor Americans living in the 19 states opting against Medicaid expansion, you\u2019re out of luck.</p> <p>Most concede Hillary Clinton will probably win the election next month. She\u2019ll have a narrow window to make changes to the ACA before gridlock returns. While Democrats may take control of the <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/even-if-democrats-win-the-senate-in-2016-their-majority-is-unlikely-to-endure/2016/10/23/443b9bec-9930-11e6-b4c9-391055ea9259_story.html\">Senate</a>, the scales will probably tip back the other way in the 2018 midterm elections. Democratic control of the <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.npr.org/2016/10/24/499082622/house-top-40-flipping-control-still-a-tough-task-for-democrats\">House</a> remains a long shot. This is the time to think and act big.</p> <p>Clinton has come out in favor of a public option: a Medicare-like plan that would compete with private plans on the health insurance marketplace. With lower <a href=\"https://www.cbo.gov/publication/41746\">administrative costs</a> and greater <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27140993\">bargaining power</a> to negotiate more favorable rates with healthcare providers, a public option would have a competitive advantage over private Obamacare plans and would probably prove cheaper. Meanwhile, premiums for private plans will probably keep going up as big insurance companies get bigger by acquiring smaller ones and there\u2019s less competition and fewer choices.</p> <p>If Clinton wants to close the gap and help the Obamacare losers, she\u2019ll have to think more boldly. She might consider expanding tax credits up the economic ladder and offering vouchers to the poor living in states that didn\u2019t expand Medicaid so they too can buy Obamacare plans. Obamacare showed us that we can insure more Americans. How we treat our sick and our poor is a choice we make as a nation. Done right, Clintoncare could eventually pave the way for health insurance for all.</p>",

I work long hours in a tough job with hideous commute yet am petrified of the consequences of being jobless. The film only touched on losing your home, too. I volunteered at a food bank and am amazed people think it's free food- when I volunteered you needed a referral to get some cereal, dried and canned goods. People are disgusting if they sneer or make derogatory comments about those who are forced to resort to them.

Water ran down the walls, we had a cupboard in which a loo, mini basin and a mouldy shower were all we had for personal hygiene. A communal kitchen stank of shitty nappies and urine; and the occasional waft of cannabis from the landing opposite where another row of rooms housed other hostel residents.</p> <p>I've kept the whole set of photos.

Need to phone the DWP for help as you have no money and your benefits are delayed? That will be several 40 minute phonecalls, at full rate please. We might help you then - but if we request evidence, at least 50% of the time we will lose it, and then you will have to give us another 40 minute call to find out what happens....before sending it again and waiting. And there's alot more....one guy, for instance, very confused, with a serious mental health problem, walked 6 miles to my office as he could not afford the bus fare! He had lived for a week off one tin of beans. At first I told him I couldn't help. He collapsed crying. I contacted a colleague in another organisation who was, fortunately, able to secure the vouchers you need to get food at a food bank. You can get those from the job centre by the way.

I also have health problems of my own. I was on ESA, my daughter received DLA and we had tax credits. We got by together, she got what she needed, and so did I.

My daughter left college in July, meaning she is entitled to benefits in her own right now in the form of ESA. I no longer get tax credits or child benefit, or the meagre amount from her absent father in child support. I was so ill that I decided to ask social services to deal with my daughter's finances. She was entitled to her benefits from the beginning of September, yet we are still waiting for the DWP to make a decision. Then we have to wait for social services to assess her because she has to contribute to her care costs. She has had no money in almost 2 months. </p> <p>I am currently scraping by on income support. I do claim carer's allowance, but because she spends some time in residential care and some with me, I have to claim for the time she's with me.

I have to drive 120 miles a week to get my daughter from her residential placement to home and back, then she has a schedule of activities over the weekend which can't be changed as it would upset and confuse her too much. So for the last 7 weeks I have had to pay for fuel, her activities, food for us both and the usual bills out of the basic amount of income support that is meant to be just enough for one person to survive on. </p> <p>I was referred to the food bank 3 weeks ago when I broke down and admitted how hard it was getting. I had to miss one of my daughter's weekend visits because I simply couldn't afford it. Because of this, I miss out on a week's worth of carer's allowance, and she misses out on her DLA, which is also only payable for the time she spends at home with me. </p> <p>I was so grateful to the food bank, I was embarrassed but humbled, and I have worked hard on making the most of the donated food so not a scrap is wasted. I would like to thank them for all their hard work, they are doing such amazing work. But when the Welfare State was set up, it was supposed to be there to prevent this. It was designed to help those in most need, to stop them from starving, to give them a basic standard of life so that they didn't live in a tent on the streets. It was meant to help avoid poverty, malnutrition and unnecessary suffering. But this government has decided to open up that hole at the bottom of the ladder so that those people on the bottom rung can now be knocked off into the poverty that the Welfare State was designed to avoid. </p> <p>This is not about immigrants, it's not about junkies, it's not about lazy layabouts pretending to be sick and disabled, it's about ordinary people who worked in the steel works, or BHS, or any other business which has failed or been sold off by the government and their super rich cronies. People who have gone from highly trained and skilled jobs into having nothing. And it's about the government deliberately sabotaging the Welfare State, making it go slower and slower, cutting people off from the support they desperately need or making them wait for weeks with nothing so they end up in debt and struggling to feed their children. It's what they said they would do, offload as much as possible onto charities, no matter what suffering they inflict. </p> <p>If it wasn't for me having to make sure my daughter got what she needs, I wouldn't be here now. I've contemplated suicide, I've thought about stealing, I've even thought about prostitution because of this situation. In the end I sold clothes and other belongings to get a few quid to keep me going and make sure I don't end up in court as a criminal. I'm just an ordinary person, I'm not scum, I'm not a thief or a junkie, but when you are desperate you end up resorting to desperate means.</p></div> </div> </div>  </figure>  <h2>It\u2019s almost impossible without help from friends and family<br></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-comment\" data-canonical-url=\"https://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/86032618\">  <div class=\"d2-comment-embedded\" itemscope itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Comment\"> <div class=\"d2-left-col\"> <a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/12161274\" title=\"View Steven Dixon\u2019s profile\"> <img class=\"d2-avatar\" src=\"https://avatar.guim.co.uk/user/12161274\" height=\"40\" width=\"40\" alt=\"User avatar for Steven Dixon\"> </a> </div> <div class=\"d2-right-col\"> <div itemscope itemprop=\"author\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\"> <a class=\"d2-username\" href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/12161274\" title=\"View Steven Dixon\u2019s profile\" itemprop=\"url\"> <span itemprop=\"givenName\">Steven Dixon</span> </a> </div> <div class=\"d2-permalink\"> <a class=\"d2-datetime\" href=\"https://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/86032618\" title=\"Link to this comment\" itemprop=\"datePublished\">23 October 2016 6:52pm</a> </div> <div class=\"d2-body\" itemprop=\"text\"><p>I am representing a client who was on ESA for a while and has her final court appeal in a few weeks time.Whilst awaiting this appeal date she,like Daniel Blake in Ken Loach's movie,was not entitled to ESA.She was told she had to apply for Jobseeker's Allowance(JSA).<br />As she could not adhere to the claimant commitment.It was impossible for her to <br />jobsearch for 35 hrs a week,she was too ill to attend courses and she cannot use a computer due to severe disability in one hand.She had to withdraw her claim and went without money for nearly 4 months.<br />Luckily she had support from friends and family whilst her ESA was reinstated in the run-up to the appeal, but many people like the character Daniel Blake do not.<br />The appeal comes soon but it is unlikely my client will score the necessary 15 points to stay on ESA,so she will have no choice but to sign on JSA and will probably be sanctioned on week one.

  "<p>It sounds more like a day spa than an office: a mile of walking trails, a cafeteria serving locally grown food, views of nature from almost every room in the building \u2013 including the stairwells \u2013 and a wood-paneled lobby designed to absorb excess sound.</p> <p>Welcome to French manufacturing giant Saint-Gobain\u2019s North American headquarters. Since moving into the Malvern, Pennsylvania building in October last year, Saint-Gobain has kept notes on the effect of these features on its employees, and compared it to its previous office seven miles down the road.</p> <p>The company says it has seen a 97% increase in the average weekly number of potential customers between January 2015 and August 2016, compared to the same period the previous year. Saint-Gobain says its employees have also reported feeling more energetic since moving into the new building. Some 38% are now members of the onsite fitness center.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2016/feb/10/office-beautiful-pretty-views-employees-productive\">Does a pretty office make a productive workforce?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Even the implication that a greener, smarter work environment could impact the company\u2019s performance is proof enough that the changes are worthwhile, said Carmen Ferrigno, vice president of communications at Saint-Gobain. The Saint-Gobain office is featured in a new report from the World Green Building Council, a global network of national green building councils, which looks at how sustainably designed buildings can boost productivity and health in the workplace.</p> <p>The report, released Tuesday, examines how the green features of 15 buildings around the world are helping businesses save money and improve staff morale. Take Swedish construction and development company Skanska, which was able to cut sick days by two-thirds after it rebuilt its office in Doncaster, UK, improving indoor air quality, cutting down on noise levels and installing a central light well that increased the natural daylight in the building. The company was able to save \u00a328,000 ($34,209) in staff costs in 2015, and employee satisfaction grew from 58% to 78%.</p> <p>\u201cThe results are clear \u2013 putting both health and wellbeing, and the environment, at the heart of buildings is a no brainer for businesses\u2019 employees and their bottom line,\u201d said Terri Wills, CEO of the World Green Building Council.</p> <p>The report lays out a number of factors that the authors say create a healthier office environment and can help boost a company\u2019s earnings: good ventilation, natural sunlight, low noise levels, windows with views outside and a flexible work area that allows employees to be more mobile within the office.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5c214e08d0890a6c53cf4b16237d7f831405bc8e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5c214e08d0890a6c53cf4b16237d7f831405bc8e/0_476_7135_4281/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The office campus includes over a mile of walking trails for employees.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The office campus includes over a mile of walking trails for employees.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jeffrey Totaro</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>According to the report, when combined, these factors have an impact on the way people work. For instance, distracting sounds in the office, such as a computer or printer beeping, and loud conversations, can <a href=\"http://www.human.cornell.edu/dea/outreach/upload/FPM-Notes_Vol1_Number11.pdf\">negatively affect a person\u2019s mood and make it difficult for them to concentrate</a>, causing stress. Meanwhile, too much carbon dioxide in an office has been shown to <a href=\"http://newscenter.lbl.gov/2012/10/17/elevated-indoor-carbon-dioxide-impairs-decision-making-performance/\">impair decision making and make employees feel tired</a>. Exposure to sunlight also makes a difference: a <a href=\"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2013/06/130603114000.htm\">2013 study</a> from Northwestern University found that employees that worked in offices with windows slept an average of 46 more minutes a night compared to workers in windowless offices. That\u2019s because sunlight helps to regulate the body\u2019s circadian rhythms, which tells our bodies when to sleep, eat and wake up.</p> <p>Saint-Gobain\u2019s 277,000 square-foot office took nearly two years to complete, and cost $80m. There were a few reasons for the move, said Ferrigno. For one, the firm wanted a space that showcased the building technologies from its family of companies and allowed its research teams to measure the impact of these products on a real workplace. The building currently uses eight of the company\u2019s products on its exterior and 32 in its interior, including SageGlass on the windows, which helps control how much sunlight enters the building.</p> <p>The company has also committed to reducing energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions by 75% at its buildings, excluding warehouse and production facilities, by 2040, so that goal added further impetus to refurbish.</p> <p>\u201cWe knew we needed to reinvent space to foster a greater sense of collaboration and connect people from different disciplines,\u201d Ferrigno said. \u201cDo we just move into a nice place, or as a leader in building materials, do you try to invent the best space possible so the medium becomes the message?\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e64e702cdac00d0f8521118d73088f9bc7ba06ea\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e64e702cdac00d0f8521118d73088f9bc7ba06ea/0_1292_8825_5295/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Saint-Gobain\u2019s employees even got to road test office chairs: before the move, the company asked people to vote on which designs they liked best.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Saint-Gobain\u2019s employees even got to road test office chairs: before the move, the company asked people to vote on which designs they liked best.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jeffrey Totaro</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The company also surveyed its employees about what they would like to see in the new office space. Employees even got to road test office chairs: before the move, Saint-Gobain set up various chairs and pods and asked employees to vote on which designs they liked best. Employees also said they were nervous about an open-plan office, so Saint-Gobain asked the architects to triple the number of conference rooms and other private, casual work areas.</p> <p>\u201cAt first, they didn\u2019t know what to do with them,\u201d Ferrigno said. \u201cThey\u2019re just now loosening up and realizing that a lot of their work doesn\u2019t have to happen staring at a screen.\u201d</p> <p>This kind of employee engagement is known to boost productivity: a <a href=\"http://www.gallup.com/businessjournal/163130/employee-engagement-drives-growth.aspx\">2012 Gallup meta-analysis</a> of 1.4 million employees found that companies with a high level of engagement reported 21% higher productivity.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/healthy-buildings-sustainable-offices-employees\">Healthy buildings: why workers are demanding sustainable offices</a> </p> </aside>  <p>According to Ferrigno, the open-plan office works because the acoustics are kept under control. For example, a person can have a conversation at their desk without worrying their neighbor might be eavesdropping. The building\u2019s classrooms and training centers are also designed to allow sound to roll across the room, so people in the back can hear just as well as those in front. Small holes in the ceiling reflect sound throughout, while wall panels absorb sound to minimize any echo. The building also has sensors that pull out carbon dioxide when levels get high.</p> <p>That said, not everything has gone to plan. The building\u2019s air conditioning system turned out to be too efficient, making it too hot or cold inside the office too quickly. According to the new report, employee productivity drops by 4% when an office is too cold, and by 6% when it\u2019s too hot. And some Saint-Gobain are still getting used to the open-plan layout. \u201cSome of them are thrown by it and feel too exposed,\u201d said Ferrigno.</p> <p>On the whole, however, the new office has made employees at Saint-Gobain\u2019s other locations a little jealous.</p> <p>According to Ferrigno, the company is now looking to borrow features from the Pennsylvania office to upgrade some of its other buildings, including a new tower at its Paris headquarters.</p>",
  "<p>This is a fit and dedicated England team, forever gym-bound, with barely a centimetre of spare flesh to be found. They are driven but maybe not completely mad. It is hot in Dhaka, hotter than Chittagong and more humid; thunderstorms are forecast and when the players turned up to the Sher-e-Bangla stadium to prepare for the second Test, which starts on Friday, sanity seemed to be prevailing. The routine game of football was shelved.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/oct/25/england-bangladesh-the-spin\">It\u2019s a shame Bangladesh didn\u2019t win because England are so good at losing | Andy Bull</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Instead the preparation began with a rigorous fielding session, an area of the game that Trevor Bayliss will never downgrade. He has some outstanding fielders in his squad (like Ben Stokes, inevitably) and some ordinary ones (like Adil Rashid). But they all have to get better.</p> <p>In a sense this is the least of Bayliss\u2019s worries as England seek to maintain <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/oct/24/bangladesh-fall-short-as-england-secure-victory-on-final-day-of-first-test\" title=\"\">their 100% record against Bangladesh</a>. The fielding was more than adequate in Chittagong. However, Bayliss needs runs from the top four; he needs greater control from his three spinners and he would probably like to know what is his best team.</p> <p>Off they all trooped to the nets behind the concrete stands of the stadium and England\u2019s latest opening pair, Alastair Cook and Ben Duckett, were first in. Both were confronted by spin bowlers rather than pacemen from the start, which makes perfect sense since this is what may well greet them on Friday \u2013 if Cook is lucky enough to win another toss.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/oct/25/england-bangladesh-the-spin\" title=\"\">The balance of England\u2019s side will remain the same</a>. The pitch in Dhaka was soon covered up under a hessian carpet, but not before we could glimpse a dry, cracked surface lacking a single blade of live grass. The assumption is the ball will turn but no one is quite sure when. In the past, the ball has seldom spun from the first morning here as it did in Chittagong. But Bangladesh are more ambitious now.</p> <p>So England will continue with three spinners in their team. One of them will be Moeen Ali, who is also the No5 batsman. Another is almost certain to be Zafar Ansari, who is expected to come into the side for his maiden Test match at the expense of Gareth Batty or Rashid. The cod psychologists can conclude that the omission of Batty will have a negligible effect on the old boy who looks so thrilled to be here, but it might provide a significant dent to the confidence of Rashid. But this cannot be a good criterion for selecting any side.</p> <p>Being dropped should be regarded as no more than an occupational hazard by an international cricketer, which triggers greater resolve rather than misery and self-doubt. The cricketing argument points to retaining Batty if the ball is going to spin excessively from the start, but to stick with Rashid if the pitch is flatter. However the expectation is that Batty will be left out come what may.</p> <p>Taking the long-term view, the case for Ansari is strong. My suspicion is neither Bayliss nor Cook has ever seen him bowl in a match with a red ball. They desperately need some information before arriving in India.</p> <p>When the team gets there they will be confronted by a very strong Indian batting lineup, which is likely to contain nine right-handers and two left-handers. On turning pitches it is generally far more difficult to play the ball spinning away from the bat. Hence England need a functioning left-armer. Last time they had Monty Panesar; this time it could be Ansari, which might prompt a sharp intake of breath. But a man who has just completed a 40,000-word thesis on post-1960s American history, while fulfilling his duties as a professional cricketer, probably likes a challenge.</p> <p>England\u2019s off-spinners were less effective against right-handed batsmen in Chittagong. Moeen, in particular, was twice the threat against left-handed batsmen, who accounted for all of his five wickets in the first Test. By contrast he was the most vulnerable of the English bowlers against the right-handers, which was demonstrated most vividly by Sabbir Rahman. If the ball keeps spinning so much Moeen needs to improve his ability to bowl around the wicket to right-handers since it is so important out here to keep the lbw option open and the outside edge a possibility.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2016/oct/23/england-bangladesh-first-test-chittagong-talking-points\" title=\"\">So there will be an element of experimentation</a> in England\u2019s bowling lineup. There has been no hullaballoo about the prospect of Stuart Broad\u2019s 100th Test because we expect him to be rotated. Steven Finn, who made his England debut in Bangladesh six years ago, will probably replace Broad rather than Jake Ball.</p> <p>One or two of the batsmen, most notably Gary Ballance, will be fortunate to keep their place. There is surely a case for giving both Haseeb Hameed and Jos Buttler an outing before India since later in the tour it will be even harder for a batsman to be tossed into a Test at short notice and without any time in the middle. A canny bowler has the chance to ease himself into a Test when rusty but one mistake is all it takes for a batsman.</p> <p>However, such a reshuffle has been resisted. At the nets Hameed and Buttler were the last batsmen to have a knock, which is never a good sign. And then what did they all do? They took to the outfield for a game of football. To paraphrase dear old Fred Trueman: \u201cWho\u2019d have thought it?\u201d</p>",

But several attempts to challenge safe storage laws in court after the Heller decision have failed, most recently in California in 2015,according to Adam Skaggs, the litigation director at the Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence. </p> <p>That San Francisco safe storage law was very similar to DC\u2019s previous storage requirements, but it included an explicit exemption for self-defense, Skaggs said.</p> <p>Clinton\u2019s other stated gun control priorities \u2013 including expanded background checks on gun sales, a federal ban on assault weapons, and tightening restrictions on gun ownership by domestic abusers \u2013 are not currently threatened by the Heller decision. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/16/nra-hillary-clinton-donald-trump-gun-control\">NRA to spend $15m on ads to defeat Hillary Clinton in key states</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Clinton\u2019s campaign has not responded to repeated requests over the past six months to clarify whether or not she believes that cities and states should be allowed to ban handguns.</p> <p>Her campaign has accused her rival, Donald Trump, of \u201c<a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2016-05-20/hillary-clinton-believes-pivotal-gun-rights-ruling-was-wrong-adviser-says\">conspiracy theories</a>\u201d and \u201cpeddling falsehoods\u201d when he claimed that she wanted \u201cabolish\u201d the second amendment and \u201ctake your guns away\u201d.</p> <p>Since 2008, the country\u2019s largest gun control groups have moved on from the fight over the controversial Heller decision, arguing that the \u201ccommonsense\u201d gun laws they support are fully consistent with the supreme court\u2019s ruling that Americans have the right to have guns in the home for self-defense.</p> <p>Two of the largest national gun control groups, the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence and the Michael Bloomberg-backed Everytown for Gun Safety, both said in July that the Heller decision was completely compatible with the gun legislation they support. </p> <p>\u201cEverytown supports the right of law-abiding gun owners to have a gun in the home for self-defense, as articulated in Heller,\u201d Everytown\u2019s legal director, Elizabeth Avore, said in a statement in July. \u201cNothing in the decision is inconsistent with commonsense laws to prevent gun violence.\u201d</p> <p>While Heller was a crucial symbolic victory for gun rights advocates in terms of constitutional interpretation, it has had little impact on the country\u2019s broader landscape of gun laws. Lower courts have upheld the vast majority of gun control laws challenged under Heller. </p> <p>It\u2019s not clear why Clinton has taken a more aggressive line in questioning Heller than mainstream gun control groups have done. </p> <p>In May, one of Clinton\u2019s senior policy advisers <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2016-05-20/hillary-clinton-believes-pivotal-gun-rights-ruling-was-wrong-adviser-says\">told Bloomberg Politics</a>: \u201cIn overturning Washington DC\u2019s safe storage law, Clinton worries that Heller may open the door to overturning thoughtful, common sense safety measures in the future,\u201d Maya Harris said in an emailed statement to Bloomberg Politics.</p> <p>Eugene Volokh, a UCLA law professor and prominent gun rights supporter, said Clinton may be \u201cboxed in\u201d by her previous statements about Heller. </p> <p>\u201cI think the arguments she\u2019s making sound like ways to try to minimize the damage to her from past statements,\u201d he said. </p> <p>Volokh and Alan Gura, the attorney who successfully argued the Heller case in front of the supreme court, both said they doubted Clinton\u2019s claim that she truly supports an individual right to gun ownership. </p> <p>\u201cIf you were to say, \u2018I support abortion rights, but I\u2019m for overturning Roe v Wade and Planned Parenthood v Casey, then what kind of abortion rights are you supporting?\u201d Volokh said. </p> <p>Gura called Clinton\u2019s endorsement of an individual right \u201cmeaningless\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cYou can regulate things out of existence and can still pretend that you support the underlying right.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e046135a20b69696f185fc6f172e1afc843083ce\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e046135a20b69696f185fc6f172e1afc843083ce/0_180_3578_2148/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Remington gun\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The constitutional right of Americans to bear arms has become a flashpoint in the presidential contest between Clinton and Trump.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bloomberg/Bloomberg via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Saul Cornell, a legal historian and second amendment expert at Fordham University, said it was fair for gun rights advocates to question if Clinton wanted to ban handguns, but doubted that she would actually take such an extreme position. <br></p> <p>\u201cIf that was, in fact, what she wanted, she is way out of line with the mainstream thinking on this question, both jurisprudentially and public policy-wise, which would be very odd for her,\u201d Cornell said. Clinton tended to hew to mainstream liberal policy positions, not stake out bold stances, he said. </p> <p>\u201cThe more likely explanation is there\u2019s some confusion here.\u201d </p> <p>But Clinton\u2019s debate-night description of the Heller case as being about trying \u201cto protect toddlers from guns\u201d<strong> </strong>did not help her, Cornell said.</p> <p>The candidate could have made plenty of valid critiques of Heller. </p> <p>Instead, Cornell said, \u201cshe went for what was the most focus-grouped, simplistic analysis, and that played right into the hands of people who were saying she was being disingenuous.\u201d</p> <p>Fact-checkers have largely given Clinton the <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/may/11/donald-trump/donald-trump-falsely-claims-hillary-clinton-wants-/\">benefit</a> <a href=\"http://www.factcheck.org/2016/05/trump-distorts-clintons-gun-stance/\">of the doubt</a> on her <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2016/06/05/hillary-clinton-wavers-on-second-amendment-right-to-bear-arms/\">sometimes dodgy</a> statements about the second amendment \u2013 a choice that may have helped fuel conservative perceptions that the media has been biased against Trump and for Clinton. </p> <p>At the same time, the NRA has given the candidate no benefit of the doubt. </p> <p>\u201cThe gun rights community always needs somebody to vilify, and Hillary Clinton is the obvious candidate. In that respect, it doesn\u2019t really matter what she says on the issue,\u201d said Robert Spitzer, a political scientist who has written extensively on America\u2019s gun debate.</p> <p>The NRA has agued that the second amendment is on the ballot in 2016, since the next president will get to nominate a supreme court justice to replace Antonin Scalia, a gun rights champion and the author of the Heller decision, who died in February.  </p> <p>Asked about Clinton\u2019s assertion that she believes in an individual right to own guns, an NRA spokeswoman said that \u201cthose words ring hollow\u201d and that Clinton \u201ccan\u2019t have it both ways\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cShe believes that the supreme court got it wrong on Heller, which means she does not believe you have an individual right to own a firearm in your home for self-protection,\u201d Jennifer Baker said after last week\u2019s debate. </p> <p>Clinton\u2019s opinion on the second amendment may ultimately be less consequential than gun rights advocates fear, or than liberals might hope. Among second amendment scholars, the most common opinion is that even a supreme court with several Clinton appointees is unlikely to overturn the Heller decision completely, though it might try to water down the full implications of the ruling. </p> <p>Adam Winkler, a UCLA law professor who wrote a book on the Heller case, said earlier this year that it was lack of political support in Congress and in statehouses, not the supreme court\u2019s Heller decision, that was standing in the way of progress on new gun laws. </p> <p>\u201cOverturning Heller would be a huge mistake. There\u2019s a real possibility of a backlash,\u201d he said. \u201cThe gun rights movement is very well organized in all 50 states. If the court were to overturn Heller there would a very rapid response by the National Rifle Association for a constitutional amendment strengthening gun rights.\u201d</p>",

We are furthering the case for large scale, democratically run social housing models, such as renters cooperatives, and the rolling out of ownership models that offer long term security but with less debt, such as community land trust homes and mutual home ownership schemes.</p> <p> With levels of home ownership at an all-time low, the promise of right to buy to give more people a share in the nation\u2019s property wealth has failed dramatically. In fact, in the midst of today\u2019s housing crisis, people in all tenures are losing what control they had over their homes and the areas in which they live.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/housing-network/2015/nov/30/lambeth-council-demolish-homes-illegal-cressingham-gardens-high-court\">Lambeth wanted to demolish our homes. We said that was illegal - and we were right</a> </p> </aside>  <p> The loss of social housing puts those who cannot afford to buy at the mercy of private landlords, with weak protections against eviction or rent hikes. Even those who own a home are not really in control. Home ownership does not mean safety, security or control if you find yourself unable to pay the mortgage, or in negative equity.</p> <p> Not just individually, but as a society we\u2019ve lost control of our housing system. With the house price gap between regions growing bigger since the Brexit vote, and a London-driven housing bubble looming over the wider economy, this is the time to ask: what would real control look like over how we do housing?</p> <p> Some communities affected by the housing crisis are managing to change how it affects people in their area. We could learn from their achievements in seizing back some control.</p> <p>Groups such as like Focus E15, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/housing-network/2015/jul/17/london-residents-pay-thousands-homes-town-down-cressingham-gardens\">Cressingham Gardens People\u2019s Plan</a> and the Butterfields Estate residents, who have proposed alternative plans for preserving and improving their homes, demonstrate the resilience and ingenuity of London tenants threatened with eviction. </p> <p>Another example is St Ives\u2019 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/may/06/st-ives-cornwall-backs-residents-only-home-ownership-plan-referendum\">prohibition on building second homes</a>, which shows a commitment by the community to prioritise local need over wealth from holiday makers. And the building of affordable homes through urban community land trusts \u2013 such as developments going up in Liverpool, Bournemouth, Bristol and Leeds this year \u2013 shows demand for models of ownership that allow people long term security in a home, without the expectation of rising prices. It is this price expectation that has been turning homes into assets for 40 years.</p> <p> But endeavours like these are up against it. The soaring value of land, particularly in cities, skews the wider market and encourages developers to hoard sites while prices climb. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/housing-network/2016/jul/29/good-housing-plan-local-needs-nhs\">Finally some good news: a housing plan that meets local needs</a> </p> </aside>  <p> </p> <p> At the New Economics Foundation we are pursuing routes to enable communities, in partnership with local institutions and civic powers, to take back some control over housing locally. The aim is to empower more people to demand and create housing projects that really meet real local need. What could this look like?</p> <p> In Wales the government is working in partnership with the Welsh Cooperative Centre and Confederation of Cooperative Housing to build homes led by local communities that are cooperatively managed. </p> <p> Across the rest of the UK, community-led projects have not yet gained similar levels of political championship, but are nonetheless catching the attention of many local authorities struggling to provide affordable homes and protect them from being lost to private landlords through right to buy. </p> <p> One way non-profit and low cost housing can work for all types of locations and people is to keep as much land as possible in public or community ownership. As public land is sold off, we\u2019re working to improve local knowledge and interest in sites we already own, and devising ways to level the playing field of who gets access. Without action, private developers backed by big finance will continue to win.</p> <p> The housing crisis will not be solved by communities going it alone, but bolstering and rolling out their achievements and building partnerships with powers locally, are important steps to be taken now. </p> <p><em><a href=\"http://neweconomics.org/search/?_sft_people=alice-martin\">Alice Martin</a> is Housing and work lead at the New Economics Foundation</em></p> <p><strong><a href=\"https://register.theguardian.com/housing/\">Sign up</a> for your free Guardian Housing network newsletter with news and analysis sent direct to you on the last Friday of the month.

With six different musicians involved on these discs there are unevennesses, but none of the playing is less than very good, and some is breathtaking.</p> <p>Most of the recordings were made during the past five years. Some have been released by Piano Classics as single discs, while some, such as <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.elisatomellini.com/\">Elisa Tomellini</a>\u2019s busy roundup of Rachmaninov\u2019s early piano pieces, are new. There are exceptions: <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.alexanderghindin.com/\">Alexander Ghindin</a>\u2019s collection of the early Morceaux de Fantaisie and Rachmaninov\u2019s assorted transcriptions dates back to the mid 1990s, while <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.harrisonparrott.com/artist/profile/nikolai-lugansky\">Nikolai Lugansky</a>\u2019s performances of the Second Piano Sonata (in the revised 1931 version) and the Corelli Variations, come from a Channel Classics disc made before Lugansky won the silver medal at the 1994 Tchaikovsky competition. While it\u2019s odd that none of the label\u2019s regular stable of pianists have made recent recordings of the sonata and the variations, which are two of Rachmaninov\u2019s greatest works, the young Lugansky\u2019s torrential playing doesn\u2019t seem out of place among the precocious brilliance here.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"eb4601f406857e424322ce1753a2ab1a86ac8670\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/eb4601f406857e424322ce1753a2ab1a86ac8670/0_13_1029_617/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Lukas Geniu\u0161as.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lucidity and poise \u2026 Lukas Geniu\u0161as.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Wieslawa Dalecka</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The discs that really stand out are from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/jan/14/lukas-geniusas-review-brilliance-and-maturity\">Lukas Geniu\u0161as</a> and <a href=\"http://zlatachochieva.com/\">Zlata Chochieva</a>. Geniu\u0161as, who came second in the 2010 Chopin and 2015 Tchaikovsky piano competitions, plays the complete preludes with such wonderful control, lucidity and poise it\u2019s hard to believe the recording was taken live from a recital at the Moscow Conservatory in 2013. Chochieva, though, is the real discovery; her account of the two sets of \u00c9tudes-Tableaux, performances of huge emotional scope and intense drama, are as fine as any on disc, while she revels in the dark textures of the First Sonata and makes the Chopin Variations seem a much more convincing work than it can often seem. It\u2019s worth buying this set just for Chochieva and Geniu\u0161as\u2019s performances, though the rest of it isn\u2019t exactly shabby.</p>",

The band \u201cspoke to me and a small group of friends\u201d, Jarmusch said, and it wasn\u2019t \u201cCalifornia hippie music\u201d or British rock.</p> <p>\u201cIt was working class, ass-kicking incredible rock\u2019n\u2019roll,\u201d Jarmusch said. \u201cSo It had a big effect.

But he said he was indebted to numerous locals for their assistance in locating fresh material, including Ben Blackwell, drummer of the Detroit rock band <a href=\"http://www.dirtbombs.net/\">the Dirtbombs</a> and co-founder of <a href=\"https://thirdmanrecords.com/\">Third Man records</a>.</p> <p>The process was laborious, he added. One crew member spent over a year trying to receive clearance on the use of the amassed footage.</p> <p>\u201cIt was a lot of really digging for stuff,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Iggy said the film offered a whiplash of emotions, but he has mostly reflected on what\u2019s presented in the 108-minute film during private moments.</p> <p>\u201cMy main emotion was delight and intrigue at: OK, what footage are they going to use next?\u201d he said. But any instance where he or the Stooges are exposed in a public way prompts an introspective moment, he added.</p> <p>\u201cI go through some cathartic emotion because we did have a rough time getting our point across,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Jarmusch seemed to echo that point when asked about starting the film with a focus on the early demise of the Stooges.</p> <p>\u201cI was realizing, \u2018Wow, you know, the Stooges \u2013 Funhouse, Raw Power \u2013 are some of the most incredible gifts to rock\u2019n\u2019roll ever, right?\u201d he said. \u201cAnd yet they made these gifts, and then they\u2019re 23 or 24 years old, and the world has basically pissed on them and then they\u2019re going home to their moms. And that really struck me.\u201d</p> <p>Throughout the film, Iggy emphasized his intention to avoid adopting a political bent in the Stooges, and later to never be labeled and lumped in with other artists.</p> <p>So when an audience member shouted out from the balcony \u201cWho should I vote for?\u201d Iggy was expectedly \u2013 and politely \u2013 mum.</p> <p>After a brief pause, he offered a pick.</p> <p>\u201cVote for me,\u201d he said with a smile, and the crowd broke into cheers. </p>",
  "<p>Television is often accused by faith leaders of marginalising religion. But, if this sin of omission exists, the charitable explanation would be that the subject imposes a double penance on schedulers. In a largely secular society, not only is the potential audience for shows on religious subjects small, but those few who might tune in tend to be hypersensitive about coverage of their beliefs or those of rival worldviews.<br></p> <p>But, though theology may be a minority interest, the politics and psychology of the Vatican have long proved a fascination, and TV fiction has often genuflected towards Rome. Graham Greene (a convert who made the church his central subject as a novelist) once said that Catholicism was naturally dramatic because of the moral jeopardy within a system in which believers were forbidden contraceptives or abortion, and clergy were forbidden sex at all. This week, The Young Pope \u2013 starring Jude Law as Lenny Belardo, an American cardinal who becomes Pope Pius XIII \u2013 takes its place in a congregation of memorable TV shows involving Catholicism.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"3dc4c4a74fc8d14db65ff38c7c4b37c48a056c29\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3dc4c4a74fc8d14db65ff38c7c4b37c48a056c29/0_65_3504_2102/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Most of the characters had been baptised in the Roman faith \u2026 The Sopranos.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Baptised in the Roman faith \u2026 The Sopranos.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/HBO/Sportsphoto Ltd.</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>President Josiah Bartlet in The West Wing, Dana Scully in The X-Files and Peggy Olsen in Mad Men were all Catholics whose faith was significant. And as a result of their Italian-American background, most of the characters in The Sopranos had been baptised in the Roman faith, and the sacrament of confession (and its secular descendant, therapy) underlay the moral agonies of Tony Soprano and his relatives. Another high-profile US series \u2013 Lost \u2013 and a British one \u2013 Life on Mars/Ashes to Ashes \u2013 both proved at their conclusions to have been occurring in versions of purgatory, the place of purification that, in Catholic doctrine, stands between death and heaven for troubled souls.</p> <p>The Young Pope, though, stands out as a startlingly original treatment of the topic. Created by big-screen film director Paolo Sorrentino, whose films include <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/sep/05/le-grande-bellezza-great-beauty-review\">The Great Beauty</a> and Youth, no other recruit from the movies has transferred their cinematic sensibility to the new medium so successfully.</p> <p>The most obvious story to have told would be a sort of House of Cardinals, exploiting the parallels (elections, cabinet positions, assassination threats) between the Vatican and Washington. The Young Pope has a small strand of such narrative \u2013 disloyal Cardinals plot to \u201csave the church\u201d from the unpredictable American \u2013 but Sorrentino starts after the papal election, avoiding the tantalisingly melodramatic plotlines of the death of an old pope and the choice of a new one.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"655d6bbf069c2ae2a9c4c899b414572d57720bc6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/655d6bbf069c2ae2a9c4c899b414572d57720bc6/0_98_1500_900/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Young Pope.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Facing the faithful \u2026 The Young Pope.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gianni Fiorito/Sky TV</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This is no ecclesiastical procedural: Law\u2019s character wakes up as pope, preparing to face the faithful in St Peter\u2019s Square. As it happens, this is logistically improbable (popes tend to be elected in early evening and address the waiting crowds immediately) but Sorrentino needs Pope Pius XIII to start in bed so he can unleash a lavish dream sequence, seamlessly merging pontifical news footage with fantasy material, that sets the tone for the whole show.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/oct/25/the-young-pope-jude-law-paolo-sorrentino\">Puffing pontiff: The Young Pope's Oscar-winning director on Jude Law, sex and cigarettes</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In terms of televisual heritage, The Young Pope most bends the knee to Mad Men: Lenny Belardo, like Don Draper, has a central blankness that is both attractive and dangerous. Abandoned by hippy parents, he was raised at an orphanage where he came under the tutelage of Sister Mary (Diane Keaton), a nun who became his surrogate mother. As happened with the enigmatic advertising executive, the truths and rumours about Lenny\u2019s past seem set to become central.</p> <p>Otherwise, Sorrentino cuts his own cloth, consistently resisting the templates of Vatican drama. The standard storyline of a liberal reformist pope who battles reactionaries is reversed. Law\u2019s character is theologically severe, confirming homosexuality as a sin and urging the faithful to make God their priority. And, while the current occupant of the throne of St Peter is Pope Francis, a natural theatric happy to pose for selfies with the crowds, Pius XIII refuses to be photographed and delivers his public homilies in silhouette.</p> <p>What\u2019s most striking, though, is that its attitude to the papacy is simultaneously cheeky and serious. Pius XIII is a chain-smoker whose diet consists largely of Cherry Coke Zero, while Keaton\u2019s Sister Mary sleeps in a T-shirt with the slogan: \u201cI\u2019m a virgin (but this is an old shirt).\u201d Sorrentino also delights in surreal background details, including a kangaroo gifted to the pope by the Australian government, Cardinals playing pool on a table occupied by a dog, and footballing nuns taking part in a penalty shootout while Ave Maria soars on the soundtrack.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7bc2f5d6269186ea6b6fc61d4c11d4ead9b24d15\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7bc2f5d6269186ea6b6fc61d4c11d4ead9b24d15/0_0_1500_1067/1000.jpg\" alt=\"This is no ecclesiastical procedural \u2026 The Young Pope.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"711\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">This is no ecclesiastical procedural \u2026 Jude Law plays the Pope with a marvellous mix of humanity and unearthliness.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sky TV</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Amid these moments of irreverence, Law\u2019s pope is a reverent man, whose faith and vows are taken seriously. Even before the virgin T-shirt, it\u2019s clear that Keaton\u2019s character is a sort of Mother Mary. And, while it is common in the work of Dan Brown for the pope to be secretly the antichrist, there are strong early hints that Lenny may have dropped the anti. He seems to possess miraculous powers and, like Jesus, to have known of his mission since childhood. </p> <p>This is a show that trusts its audience enough for a key plot point to be established through words written in unsubtitled Latin in the condensation on a coach window. Handed parts that must be among the most unusual but rewarding of their careers, Law and Keaton will have other actors praying not to be up against them for an Emmy. Their portrayals feature subtle touches of lightness and darkness that leave viewers alternately faithful and agnostic about them.</p> <p>Law creates a hybrid of humanity and unearthliness that recalls David Bowie as Thomas Newton. What might have been House of Cardinals becomes, in Sorrentino\u2019s hands, something more like The Pope Who Fell to Earth \u2013 magnificently strange and strangely magnificent.</p> <ul> <li><em>The Young Pope starts in the UK on Thursday at 9pm on Sky Atlantic. </em><br></li> </ul>",
  "<p>During the debates on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/jun/11/obama-administration-universal-healthcare-reform\">Obamacare</a> in 2009, Republicans picked up on a part of the bill that suggested the terminally ill should have access to voluntary end-of-life counselling sessions, paid for by Medicare. Sarah Palin, or a rhetorical genius in her employ, then decided to call such a session an obligatory \u201cdeath panel\u201d, a phrase that quickly went viral, and the proposal was eventually dropped. \u201cDeath panel\u201d was simply a lie, but it was also a fine example of <a href=\"http://unspeak.submarinechannel.com/\">Unspeak</a>: a cleverly engineered phrase that smuggles in a dubious argument. And for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/markthompson\">Mark Thompson</a>, former director general of the BBC and now CEO of the New York Times company, it is emblematic of what has gone wrong with modern political debate.</p> <p>We are living, his superb book argues, through \u201ca crisis of political language\u201d, characterised by lies, spin and demagoguery. Of course, as he acknowledges, people have been decrying the corruption of political language since politics began. But, he says, our circumstances are still \u201cexceptional\u201d, stemming from both changes in modern media and in the way politicians speak. So how did it happen?</p> <p>Thompson\u2019s historical account begins with Margaret Thatcher\u2019s 1979 election victory. Before then, \u201ctechnocratic competence remained the gold standard, and politicians on all sides generally continued to appeal to reason and the facts as they strove to win policy arguments\u201d. Thatcher\u2019s own rhetoric sounded new: \u201chard-edged, insistent, utterly sure of itself\u201d, which prompted increased bitterness and heat in public debates. Ronald Reagan, meanwhile, displayed an \u201cunrivalled command of every register of modern oratory\u201d. In the 1990s came the New Labour spin machine: as a BBC news editor at the time, Thompson recalls that \u201cthe weird combination of professionalism and paranoia with which the Blair government sought to guard its narrative felt new and decidedly alien\u201d.</p> <p>On the other hand, he notes: \u201cBlair\u2019s people believed \u2026 that the new tactics were the only credible response to an unremittingly hostile media environment. That claim was hard to dismiss.\u201d Thompson\u2019s own experience in the media is brilliantly deployed throughout for insight. Few other commentators on the subject can call on such depth of personally informed analysis. Working in New York in the 1980s, he noticed a new style of TV news editing that boiled everything down to \u201csoundbites\u201d. \u201cUrgent to the point of brutality, it was a style of editing which could deliver TV news of panache and immediacy \u2026 but it came at a price: everything had to be shortened and simplified.\u201d This style has since, of course, become the norm everywhere. And if such are the cramped containers in which politicians have to place their speech, you can hardly blame them alone for loading it with all the dubious tricks at their disposal. The glamour that attaches to \u201cforensic\u201d or adversarial instead of \u201canalytical\u201d journalism hardly helps either. (David Cameron once told Thompson that he didn\u2019t understand why anyone agreed to go on <em>Newsnight</em> any more: it was just a \u201csnuff movie for politicians\u201d.)</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Cameron told Thompson he didn\u2019t understand why anyone agreed to go on Newsnight: it was a \u201csnuff movie for politicians\u201d</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Thompson is a sharp and entertaining analyst of political language itself, drawing on terms from classical rhetoric. (\u201cDeath panel\u201d, he notes, is an enthymeme: an incomplete argument where listeners are invited to fill in the gaps.) He offers sardonic close readings of speeches by Thatcher and Reagan, Blair and Trump. Arguing for the Iraq war, Blair said that \u201cweakness in the face of a threat from a tyrant is the surest way not to peace but \u2013 unfortunately \u2013 to conflict\u201d. To this, Thompson responds: \u201cIt\u2019s absurd to suggest that the \u2018surest way\u2019 to war is not to fight one. The surest way to war is simply to go to war, which is exactly what Tony Blair is now proposing.\u201d Occasionally Thompson does fall prey to political jargon himself, praising the \u201cdelicacy and grip\u201d with which Blair handled the death of Diana. (Grip?) And while he approves of the way \u201cgay marriage\u201d became \u201csame-sex marriage\u201d in public debate, he does not note that the real rhetorical clincher, in the US, was \u201cmarriage equality\u201d \u2013 itself just as much a brilliant enthymeme, or piece of Unspeak, as \u201cdeath panel\u201d.</p> <p>Discussions of political language often assume that George Orwell already had the last word on the subject with his 1946 essay \u201c<a href=\"http://www.orwell.ru/library/essays/politics/english/e_polit/\">Politics and the English Language</a>\u201d. Thompson devotes an interesting critical chapter to it. Orwell\u2019s argument, he argues, is in thrall both to a discredited positivism (here, the idea that language could ever be a perfectly precise and neutral instrument), and to what Thompson calls \u201cauthenticism\u201d: the idea that the authenticity of the speaker is what matters most. Orwell thinks that the best way to fight back against the \u201ccloudy vagueness\u201d of the euphemisers is simply to use \u201cplain speaking\u201d. But, as Thompson notes: \u201cThis is unexpectedly close to the authenticist agenda of Donald Trump and the other anti-politicians.\u201d It is their apparent plain speaking, he suggests, that explains the success of Putin, Farage, Berlusconi, Trump et al.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/mar/04/genius-donald-trumpspeak-steven-poole-words\">'Winning, winning, winning': the genius of The Donald\u2019s Trumpspeak</a> </p> </aside>  <p>So what can we do about it? Thompson calls for a new kind of political speech that he calls \u201ccritical persuasion\u201d: \u201c\u2018critical\u2019 in that it would consciously address, and submit itself to, its audience\u2019s prudential scrutiny.\u201d He advises politicians: \u201cTreat the public like grownups. Share some of your <em>actual</em> thinking about policy, including the painful and finely balanced trade-offs you face.\u201d</p> <p>The problem may be that, like full communism, critical persuasion will only work if everyone adopts it at the same time. The most charitable possible interpretation of Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s awarding a score of seven (or seven-and-a-half) out of 10 to the EU during the referendum campaign, for example, was that this was a case of \u201ccritical persuasion\u201d, sharing his thinking about the painful and finely balanced trade-offs of EU membership. But it stood no chance against the \u201cTake back control\u201d enthymeme of the Vote Leave campaign.

Blessed with children whose internal clocks obey no commands, even that one puny benefit is denied me.

I am currently crowdfunding to create a reinvention of the rural almanac, a book that will detail all the movements of the sun and the moon, the tides, and the sky, and tie them in to the seasonal food, celebrations and gardening.

No need for even binoculars for the Orionids, which have already peaked but are still visible until November 7 as the earth passes through the trail of debris left by <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halley%27s_Comet\">Halley\u2019s comet</a>. Wrap up warm, lie on your back on a blanket and locate Orion, which is where the shooting stars will appear to emerge from, hence the name.</p> <h2>Fire</h2> <p>A dark cold night is an excuse for a bonfire, or just a gathering around a little fire pit, if you\u2019re concerned about ruining your lawn. Toast marshmallows and drink buttered rum toddies: cream110g butter with 150g sugar, a teaspoon of cinnamon, half a teaspoon of nutmeg and a pinch of cloves, then put a spoonful of mixture into each glass, along with a shot of rum. Top with boiling water, stir well, and drink.</p> <h2>Wildlife</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c9ae4104eaa7cb9a23dee4fcb902af2186069c35\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c9ae4104eaa7cb9a23dee4fcb902af2186069c35/0_537_4960_2977/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Common pipistrelle bat in a UK garden at dusk.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Keep an eye out for bats, like this common pipistrelle, in the garden at dusk.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Not everything is hibernating, and winter nights can be a wonderful time to spot wildlife in your garden, as long as you have wrapped up warm enough to sit still for a while. Regularly putting out food such as meat, and dog food and cat food can lure in larger mammals such as hedgehogs, foxes, badgers and even roe deer. I have a fox that regularly visits my garden, and the moments when he stands stock still and we lock eyes are electrifying. A small mammal feeding table stocked with peanuts and wild bird food may bring in wood mice, shrews and voles. Look out for bats, particularly at dusk, and although moth numbers have fallen since the end of summer there are still enough to make putting out a moth trap well worth while.</p> <ul> <li><strong>Lia Leendertz\u2019s crowdfunding for The New Almanac is under way at <a href=\"https://unbound.com/books/the-new-almanac\">https://unbound.com/books/the-new-almanac</a>.

Working on the survival horror adventure <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2010/feb/14/silent-hill-shattered-memories-review\">Silent Hill: Shattered Memories</a>, Barlow introduced a character named Dr Kaufmann, a psychotherapist whose role, ostensibly, was to evaluate the mental wellbeing of protagonist Harry Mason. </p> <p>But that\u2019s not really why he was there. Dr Kaufmann\u2019s actual role was to psychologically assess the player. </p> <p>At key points throughout the terrifying narrative, the game provided a questionnaire inspired by <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Five_personality_traits\">the \u201cBig Five\u201d personality test</a>, a method used by academic psychologists for personality research. Players would be asked things like: Are you a private person? Do you always listen to other people\u2019s feelings? In this way it was building a psychological profile of the player. At the same time, the system was also drawing data from how players interacted with the game world: how long they spent exploring each area before moving on; whether they strayed from clearly marked paths; whether they faced non-player characters while they talked. Every action had an effect on the narrative.</p> <p>\u201cMost scenes in the game had layers of variation \u2013 in the textures and colour, the lighting and the props,\u201d explains Barlow. \u201cCharacters also had multiple appearances and personality differences. All phone calls, voicemails and readable materials had multiple variations according to different profile slices. As you approached a door to a new room, the game was spooling in the assets, testing your profile and loading up the custom asset packages to assemble your own version.\u201d </p> <p>The idea was to draw in and then unsettle the player as much as possible based on their psychological traits. Characters, monsters and environments would all be subtly changed to reflect their own fears of aggression, enclosure or darkness. </p> <p>It was a personalised nightmare.</p> <p>Game designers have been attempting to learn, assess and react to player types since the days of Dungeons and Dragons. Richard Bartle, co-creator of the original MUD roleplaying game, formed <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bartle_taxonomy_of_player_types\">a taxonomy of players</a> in 1996, and his types \u2013 Achievers, Explorers, Socialisers, and Killers \u2013 have often been often used by designers to try to pre-empt and entice different player types. <br></p> <p>Over the last decade, however, the concept of truly reactive \u201cplayer modelling\u201d, in which the game learns in real time from each individual player, has become an important part of academic research into artificial intelligence and machine learning. In 2004, AI researchers Georgios Yannakakis and John Hallam published<a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.60.6629&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf\"> a seminal paper</a> detailing their work on Pac-Man. They created a modified version of the popular arcade game with the ghosts controlled by an evolutionary neural network that adjusted their behaviour based on each player\u2019s individual strategies. In the same year, PhD student Christian Thurau presented <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.551.2301&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf\">his own player modelling system</a> that used pattern recognition and machine learning techniques to teach AI characters how to move in a game world, based on watching humans play Quake II.</p> <p>In short: games were beginning to watch and learn from players.</p> <p>Many other other studies followed. In 2007, researchers at the University of Alberta\u2019s Intelligent Reasoning Critiquing and Learning group (under Vadim Bulitko) developed <a href=\"http://www.aaai.org/Papers/AIIDE/2007/AIIDE07-008.pdf\">PaSSAGE (Player-Specific Stories via Automatically Generated Events)</a>, an AI-based interactive storytelling system that could observe and learn from player activities in a role-playing adventure. As the game progressed, the program sorted players into five different types (based on the <a href=\"http://www.sjgames.com/robinslaws/\">Robin\u2019s Laws of Dungeons &amp; Dragons</a>) and then served them game events from a library of pre-written mini-missions. If they seemed to like looking for items in the game world, they were given a quest to find an object; if they liked fighting, they were given events that involved combat.</p> <h2>Super Mario gets personal</h2> <p>That system was interesting (and is still being evolved in the department), but it relied on hand-designed set-piece events, and only had a limited grasp on who the player was. Matthew Guzdial, a PhD student at the Georgia Institute of Technology\u2019s School of Interactive Computing, is currently working on a more adaptable evolution of this concept \u2013 a version of Nintendo\u2019s Super Mario Bros platformer that features a neural network capable of <a href=\"http://www.cc.gatech.edu/news/418041/georgia-tech-researchers-train-computer-create-games-watching-youtube\">observing player actions and builds novel new level designs</a>, based on this data.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ve successfully been able to demonstrate that the generator creates levels that match a learned play style\u201d, says Guzdial who collaborated with Adam Summerville from the University of California, Santa Cruz. \u201cPut simply, if a player likes exploring, it creates levels that must be explored; if a player speed-runs, it makes levels that are suited to speed-runing.\u201d</p> <p>Super Mario, it turns out, is a popular test-bed for AI researchers. It\u2019s familiar, it allows lots of different player actions in a constrained environment, and its source code is easily available. At the University of Copenhagen, AI researchers Noor Shaker, Julian Togelius and the aforementioned Yannakakis developed a slightly different experiment based on the game. This time players were asked to provide emotional feedback on each play-through, giving scores for fun, challenge and frustration; this input was combined with data drawn from watching them play (how often the player jumped, ran or died, how many enemies they killed, etc), and the AI program constructed new levels as a result.</p> <p>Over the last decade, Yannakakis and colleagues over at the University of Malta\u2019s Institute of Digital Games, where he currently works as an associate professor, have explored various forms of machine learning to estimate a player\u2019s behavioural, cognitive and emotional patterns during play. They have combined deep-learning algorithms, which build general models of player experience from massive datasets, with sequence-mining algorithms, which learn from sequences of player actions (like continually choosing health pick-ups over ammo). They have also explored preference learning, which allow an AI system to learn from player choices between particular content types (for example, preferring levels with lots of jumping challenges over those with lots of enemies). </p> <p>Not only have they used behavioural data gathered during play, they\u2019ve also used age, gender and other player details to inform their systems. Their aim isn\u2019t just to make interesting games, however \u2013 the AI techniques they\u2019re exploring may well be used in educational software or as diagnostic or treatment tools in mental health care.</p> <p>\u201cGiven a good estimate of a player\u2019s experience, AI algorithms can automatically \u2013 or semi-automatically \u2013 procedurally generate aspects of a game such as levels, maps, audio, visuals, stories, or even game rules,\u201d says Yannakakis. \u201cThe estimate can be used to help designers shape a better experience for the player. By tracking their preferences, goals and styles during the design process, AI can assist and inspire designers to create better, more novel, more surprising game content.\u201d</p> <p>For Julian Togelius, one of the foremost experts on AI games research now based at NYU, the next step is active player modelling \u2013 he envisages an AI level designer that doesn\u2019t just react to inputs, but is actually curious about the player and their preferences, and wants to find out more. </p> <p>\u201cThere is this machine learning technique called active learning, where the learning algorithm choses which training examples to work on itself,\u201d he explains. \u201cUsing this technique, you could actually have a game that chooses in what way to explore you, the player: the game is curious about you and wants to find out more, therefore serving you situations where it does not know what you will do. That\u2019s something that will be interesting for the player too, because the game has a reasonably good model of what you\u2019re capable of and will create something that\u2019s novel and interesting to you.\u201d</p> <h2>The games that feels your emotions</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2e2e5d7001d3d4b1dcf27685e2e550c3c13c8f0c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2e2e5d7001d3d4b1dcf27685e2e550c3c13c8f0c/0_48_1920_1152/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Left 4 Dead games feature an AI Director that alters enemy types and threat levels depending on player actions\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Left 4 Dead games feature an AI Director that alters enemy types and threat levels depending on player actions.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Valve Software</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Of course, in many ways we\u2019re already seeing this kind of player modelling happening in the conventional games industry. Valve\u2019s critically acclaimed zombie shooter <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2008/dec/02/left4dead-review-xbox-pc\">Left 4 Dead </a>features an AI director that varies the type and threat level of undead enemies based on player activities in the game so far. With the arrival of free-to-play digital games on social media platforms and mobile phones, we also saw the emergence of a whole new game design ethos based on studying player data and iterating games accordingly. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2011/dec/02/facebook-games-zynga-ipo\">In its prime</a>, Zynga was famed for its huge data science department that watched how players interacted with titles such as Farmville and Mafia Wars, worked out where they were getting bored or frustrated, and tweaked the gameplay to iron out those kinks. The analysis of player metrics quickly became a business in itself with companies such as Quantic Foundry and GameAnalytics set up to help smartphone developers garner information from the activities of players.</p> <p>But these systems are commercially motivated and based around making game design bets on the activities of thousands of players \u2013 they\u2019re not about actually understanding players on an individual emotional level. </p> <p>That concept is definitely coming. Some AI researchers are shifting away from machine learning projects that watch what players do and toward systems that work out what they feel. It\u2019s possible to get an idea about a player\u2019s excitement, engagement or frustration from analysing certain in-game actions \u2013 is the player hammering the jump button, are they avoiding or engaging enemies, are they moving slowly or quickly? Simple actions can give away a lot about the player\u2019s state of mind. In 2014, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/gamesblog/2009/jan/21/artificial-intelligence-ai-game\">Julian Togelius</a> found he was able to make informed assumptions about key character traits of test subjects by watching how they played Minecraft. \u201cWe asked them questions about their life motives then analysed the logs from the game,\u201d he says. \u201cTraits like independence and curiosity very strongly correlated with lots of things that happened in the game.\u201d</p> <p>So could an AI program study that data and change a game to tweak those feelings? \u201cThe major challenge is to relate content and [player] behaviour to emotion,\u201d says Noor Shaker, a researcher at the University of Copenhagen who completed a PhD in player-driven procedural content generation. \u201cUltimately, we want to be able to identify the aspects of games that have an impact on how players experience them.\u201d</p> <p>Shaker is using a variety of methods for this purpose: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/jun/09/the-ancient-origins-of-conciousness-todd-feinberg-and-john-mallet-review\">neuroevolution</a>, random decision forests, multivariate adaptive spline models are all complex machine learning toolsets that enable neural networks to gradually learn from and adapt to different player behaviours. </p> <p>\u201cMy work recently revolves around building more accurate models of experience, implementing interactive tools that allow us to visualise the expressive space of players\u2019 emotions,\u201d says Shaker. \u201cMost of the work I have seen so far, such as adaptation in Left 4 Dead, focuses on game difficulty and adjusting the behaviour of the NPCs according to relatively simple metrics of player\u2019s behaviour. I believe there are many other aspects to experience than difficulty and there are many more elements that can be considered to manipulate player experience than the behaviour of the NPCs. Recent research has shown that emotions such as frustration, engagement and surprise can be detected and modelled by machine learning methods.</p> <p>Shaker then, is interested in developing a video game AI system that understands not just how the player plays, but how the player is feeling as they play. Imagine a game that learns a player\u2019s emotional state and generates non-player characters and story fragments that it knows will hit them right in the heart. \u201cI believe data-driven automatic content personalisation is doable,\u201d says Shaker.<br></p> <h2>The game that stalks you</h2> <p>So far, much of this research has concentrated on how the player behaves within the game world.

The data is all out there, and there\u2019s no reason why games makers couldn\u2019t use it too.<br></p> <p>In fact, AI researchers are already creating games that mine information from popular websites and bring it back for use in the narrative. Gabriella Barros is working on the concept of \u201cdata adventures\u201d with Julian Togelius, in which the AI gathers information from sites like Wikipedia and OpenStreetMaps to create globe-trotting point-and-click adventures in the style of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Where_in_the_World_Is_Carmen_Sandiego%3F_(1985)\">Where in the World is Carmen Sandiego</a><strong> </strong>\u2013 except they\u2019re based in real locations and populated by real people. These data games are just the beginning, argues Michael Cook an AI researcher at Falmouth University.</p> <p>\u201cRight now they\u2019re interested in huge, open data platforms like Wikipedia or government statistics,\u201d he says. \u201cBut you can imagine in the future a game which takes your Facebook feed instead of a Wikipedia database, and populates the game world with people you know, the things they like doing, the places they visit and the relationships people have with one another. Whether or not that sounds like a scary idea is another question, but I can definitely see it as a natural extension of [the data game concept]. We already open our lives up to so many companies every day, we might as well get a bespoke, commissioned video game out of the deal.\u201d</p> <p>Copenhagen\u2019s Noor Shaker points out that privacy issues are a bottleneck with social media data \u2013 but then it\u2019s a bottleneck that Google and co have deftly circumnavigated. \u201cOnce we have the data, and depending on the source and type, natural language processing methods such as sentiment analysis could be used to profile and cluster players according to their opinion about different social, cultural or political matters,\u201d she says. \u201cStatistics could also be collected about games, books, or songs they already purchased, liked or expressed opinion about. All this information could feed powerful machine learning methods such as neural networks or standard classification techniques that learn profiles, discover similarity or predict personality traits.\u201d<br></p> <p>So now we\u2019re getting closer to the Black Mirror concept. Imagine something like The Sims, where the pictures on your apartment walls are photos from your Facebook wall, where neighbours are your real-life friends. Or, on a darker tangent, imagine a horror adventure that knows about your relationships, your Twitter arguments, your political views; imagine a horror game that knows what you watch on YouTube. \u201cIt is only natural to expect that game data can be fused with social media activity to better profile players and provide a better gaming experience,\u201d says Yannakakis. </p> <h2>The game that reads your mind \u2013 and body</h2> <p>Researchers can envisage a game that builds a detailed psychological and social profile of a player, from both their in-game actions and online footprint \u2013 but there\u2019s still a gap between this, and the horror game posited in Black Mirror, which performs an invasive neurological hack on the player. </p> <p>Brain-computer interfacing of this sort is still the stuff of bleeding edge medical research and science fiction. However, we\u2019re already seeing the use of devices \u2013 both in research and in consumer production \u2013 that can measure physiological states such as skin conductance and heart-rate variability to assess a player\u2019s emotional reaction to game content. </p> <p>Konami\u2019s 1997 arcade dating game Oshiete Your Heart, for example, featured a sensor that measured the player\u2019s heart rate and skin conductance to influence the outcome of each romantic liaison. <a href=\"http://www.flyingmollusk.com/nevermind/\">Nevermind</a>, released by by Flying Mollusk last year, is a biofeedback-enhanced horror adventure that increases the level of challenge based on the player\u2019s stress readings. Yannakakis and other researchers are also using off-the-shelf smart camera technologies like <a href=\"http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/architecture-and-technology/realsense-overview.html\">Intel RealSense</a> and the emotion recognition software <a href=\"http://www.affectiva.com/\">Affectiva</a> to track a player\u2019s facial expressions and monitor their heartbeat \u2013 both indicators of a variety of emotions. Noor Shaker has studied how tracking a player\u2019s head pose while they take part in a game can tell us about the experience they\u2019re having. </p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://vimeo.com/187755518\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/187755518\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>Right now, these physiological inputs are mostly confined to research departments, but that may change. Valve, the company behind games like Portal and Half-Life and the HTC Vive VR headset has been experimenting with biometric inputs for years. Founder <a href=\"http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/digitalfoundry-valve-biometrics-blog-entry\">Gabe Newell predicted in 2011</a> that we would one day see game controllers with built in heart-rate and skin response detectors. A game supported by these sensors could easily present each player with different items, concepts or options to gauge a heart or skin response, adapting content on the fly depending on the reaction. Imagine a VR headset with sensors that measure skin heat response and heart rate. People are already <a href=\"https://diyhacking.com/digitising-human-emotions-virtual-reality/\">hacking this sort of thing together</a>.</p> <h2>The game that loves you</h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_edkWos2BY\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/A_edkWos2BY?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>This all sounds terrifying, but it needn\u2019t be used in the way the Black Mirror episode does. There are benevolent, perhaps even beautiful, possibilities in the idea of games learning from players. One company looking into this potential is Mobius AI, a New York and UK-based starup developing a cognitive AI engine for developers. Co-founder Dr Mitu Khandaker-Kokoris is more interested in the potential relationships that could occur between players and AI characters who have the ability to identify and learn from individual players. </p> <p>\u201cWhat games really lack is that serendipitous kind of connection we feel when we meet someone in the real world that we get along with,\u201d she says. \u201cOne of the ways this will happen is through games featuring AI-driven characters who truly understand us, and what we as individual players are expressing through the things we are actually saying and doing in the game.</p> <p>\u201cImagine, for instance, that you were the only one in the world who an AI-driven character could trust fully because the game could infer that you have similar personalities. This character could then take you down a unique experience, which only you have access to. It\u2019s a fascinating problem space, and a great challenge to think about how games could truly work you out \u2013 or rather, who you are pretending to be \u2013 by paying attention to not only what you\u2019re saying, but how you\u2019re saying it.\u201d</p> <p>Interestingly, Khandaker-Kokoris, who is also working on procedural storytelling game <a href=\"http://www.littleinvasiontales.com/\">Little Invasion Tales</a>, is more skeptical about the role of personal data mining in the future of game design. \u201cWe play games, often, to be someone who would have a different online history than our own,\u201d she says. \u201cBut then, we are partly always ourselves, too. We have to work out what it would mean in terms of role-play and the idea of a permeable magic circle.\u201d</p> <p>What\u2019s certain though, is that game creators and AI researchers are moving in the same direction: toward systems that provide content based on individual player preferences and activities. Games now cost many millions to produce \u2013 the assumption that enough players will react favourably to a single narrative, and a single experience, is becoming prohibitively risky.<strong> </strong>We live in an age of behavioural modelling and data science, an age in which Amazon is capable of <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-36773409\">building personalised video adverts in real-time</a> based on viewer preferences mined from the web. In this context, games that know you \u2013 that learn from you, that are curious about you \u2013 are almost inevitable.</p>",

When powerful organisations seek control, they always say it\u2019s to \u201cprotect the public\u201d and \u201ckeep them safe\u201d.

A <a href=\"http://aje.oxfordjournals.org/content/182/4/281.abstract\" title=\"\">meta-analysis of studies on yoga by Dr Holger Cramer of the University of Duisburg-Essen</a> confirms that it is as safe as <a href=\"http://time.com/3992506/yoga-safety/\" title=\"\">other physical movement disciplines</a>.</p> <p>In the days of the British Raj, when Britain\u2019s economy depended on commodities such as cotton, Indian cotton growers were forced on pain of imprisonment to sell their cotton yields to Britain at prices determined by the buyer. The raw cotton was sent back here, to our <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2012/sep/12/william-blakes-dark-satanic-mills\" title=\"\">\u201csatanic mills\u201d</a>, and Indians \u2013 who had been weaving cotton for centuries \u2013 were then prohibited from weaving their own and forced to buy woven cotton back at prices determined by Britain. That wouldn\u2019t happen today \u2013 would it?</p> <p>The art and science of yoga, which began in India, has become big business all over the world. <a href=\"http://www.ibisworld.co.uk/market-research/pilates-yoga-studios.html\" title=\"\">According to Ibisworld</a>, in the UK alone Yoga is worth about \u00a3790m a year. Nonetheless, yoga continues to be the ancient path of Hindu mysticism, and its first how-to manual, called the <a href=\"http://www.hinduwebsite.com/sacredscripts/hinduism/parama/katha.asp\" title=\"\">Katha Upanishad</a>, dates back between 2,000 and 3,000 years, and forms part of sacred Hindu texts. In it a young man encounters Death and a dialogue between them ensues. Death is asked about the meaning of life and offers yoga as a way of understanding it all. A <a href=\"http://nos.ukces.org.uk/Pages/index.aspx\" title=\"\">National Occupational Standard</a> dismisses this spiritual connection and replays the cotton trick: giving the British stamp of approval to a particular brand of yoga and then \u2013 under the guise of health and safety \u2013 selling it back to the teachers who are already teaching it.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The financial penalty for not complying is a tax that will hit self-employed teachers, most of whom are women</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Of course, yoga teachers, like all teachers, always need to improve on their training, but this proposal is just a way of paying a bureaucracy to ensure a two-tier system: some teachers get the stamp and others don\u2019t. It won\u2019t improve the training, but it will make it much more expensive and limit who can afford it. The financial penalty for not complying is a tax that will hit self-employed teachers, most of whom are women. A better use of resources might have been to finance research into exactly what areas of further training are needed.</p> <p>A number of years ago yoga teachers formed the <a href=\"http://www.independentyoganetwork.org/\" title=\"\">Independent Yoga Network </a>to ensure that teachers applying to get on to the <a href=\"http://www.exerciseregister.org/\" title=\"\">Register of Exercise Professionals</a> had an acceptable level of training. The IYN undertook this without any financial compensation and in support of the diversity of yoga schools.</p> <p>While yoga is part of their religion for over a billion people, it is not so for all those practising it in the UK. Many people do yoga for a sense of wellbeing \u2013 for aching backs, or muscle tension from a pressured week, or just a break from a 24/7 agenda. None of us has to change our religion \u2013 or even have one \u2013 to enjoy the benefits it offers. But nor should anyone try to misappropriate and redefine another\u2019s religion in order to enjoy a bigger slice of yoga\u2019s financial pie.</p> <p>Is yoga dangerous? Absolutely! Here\u2019s what it did for me: I was a young mum suffering from crippling <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/postnatal-depression\" title=\"\">postnatal depression</a> that disengaged me from life when I encountered yoga.

When my workmates and I went out to a nearby eaterie for at least an hour, scoffed a proper meal and probably a glass of wine. These days, like most worker bees, I stay at my desk with my fork and Tupperware pot, nose glued to the screen. And I\u2018ve become so mesmerised by the modern working culture that I\u2019d be quite shocked to find a colleague dining out at lunchtime. No booze, no siestas, no playtime.</p> <p>It seems a bit odd when we hear so much about <a href=\"https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2016/01/what-happens-when-robots-take-our-jobs/\" title=\"\">automation</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/19/world-without-work-utopia-hell-human-labour-obsolete\" title=\"\">\u201cthe end of work\u201d</a>. If the robots are coming, why are we rushed off our feet? In fact, it\u2019s all part of the same picture.</p> <p>All the main UK political parties insist that the only successful economy is one that grows, preferably faster than other economies. Growth calls for greater productivity: getting more output per unit of input. The system is greedy for more resources, but workers and machines have to do more for less. More efficient processes (including more robots) reduce the amount of human input required. So those who have jobs must work harder \u2013 and longer hours \u2013 to hang on to what they\u2019ve got and to keep the economy growing.</p> <p>Meanwhile, since robots can\u2019t do everything yet, there are new flurries of low-end jobs with zero-hours contracts, insulting pay and no security. This class has been called the \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/jun/01/voice-for-emerging-precariat\" title=\"\">precariat</a>\u201d and much of it thrives on the over-busyness of other workers.

Many precarious workers have to do two or three jobs just to make ends meet. So they are under heavy pressures too, often torn between poverty and an intolerable work-life balance.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/19/world-without-work-utopia-hell-human-labour-obsolete\">A world without work is coming \u2013 it could be utopia or it could be hell | Ryan Avent</a> </p> </aside>  <p>What can we do about it? First, take back control of the workplace. This means workers in all settings finding ways to organise and build up bargaining rights. For the casualised precariat, it could mean building new digital platforms to rival the technological giants that have cornered the market so far.</p> <p>Second, let us never forget that this is a challenge for men as well as women. Much of the stress and unhappiness that women experience at work is because they take on <a href=\"http://www.oxfam.org.uk/media-centre/press-releases/2016/03/women-spend-two-days-a-month-more-than-men-on-housework-and-childcare\" title=\"\">most of the unpaid work at home</a>. Until men really share the housework and childcare, they are unlikely to be powerful advocates for a more humane regime in the workplace.</p> <p>And third, let\u2019s move to shorter hours of paid work for everyone, not just women. This has long been argued by <a href=\"http://neweconomics.org/10-reasons-for-a-shorter-working-week/?sf_action=get_results&amp;_sf_s=new+digital+platforms&amp;_sft_people=anna-coote\" title=\"\">the New Economics Foundation</a> and there is growing <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/six-hour-working-day-sweden-boosts-productivity-and-makes-people-happier-a7023741.html\" title=\"\">evidence of its many benefits</a>. Nobody should have to work more than four days or 30 hours a week, even in today\u2019s 24-7 economy. As some jobs are automated out of existence, others could be created to cover the hours left unworked by the newly unstressed.</p> <p>It should be a gradual shift, with minimal impact on pay. For example, suppose all workers over 50 take a one-hour cut in their working week each year. If they start with a 40-hour week, they can be doing 30 hours at 60 and 20 hours at 70. And suppose all young people entering the labour market for the first time start on a 30-hour week \u2013 and stay that way, with each new cohort adding to the numbers, until it becomes the new \u201cnormal\u201d. What if all workers in organisations where there is an annual round of pay negotiations were to trade a bit more time each year for a smaller pay rise?</p> <p>All this should go hand in hand with a higher minimum wage, more generous child benefit and a more secure \u201csocial income\u201d in terms of high-quality services that are collectively funded and provided (education, health and social care, childcare, housing and so forth). If lousy wages force people to work around the clock, the problem is pay: it\u2019s not a sensible argument against shorter hours.</p> <p>If 30 hours became the new standard working week, for women and for men, across all kinds of jobs, from doctors to delivery drivers, from teachers to task-rabbits, there would be a lot less stress and anxiety at work and at home. We\u2019d have more control over our lives, more time to look after one another. We could slow down and relax more \u2013 and rely less on carbon-intensive fast food and travel. We\u2019d have more time to be active in our communities and in politics. We\u2019d have more time to campaign for a new working culture that respects love, family and friendship instead of fetishising \u201chard work\u201d. And most importantly of all we could build an economy that enables people to flourish, instead of one that is entirely fixated on growth.</p>",
  "<p>The time would come, Marx and Engels thought, when there would be only two classes, the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, and all people would align their interests with them. The economist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/guy-standing\">Guy Standing</a> is known for his descriptions of a different kind of class \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/jun/01/voice-for-emerging-precariat\">the \u201cprecariat\u201d</a>, defined by the insecurity and instability of the work it performs.

The capaciousness of the idea has been criticised, but that\u2019s also part of its appeal. The precariat is, potentially, the democratic majority. In his new book, Standing says such workers are increasingly conscious of themselves as a class, in part because they see clearly what they\u2019re not: rentiers.</p> <p>Rentiers get their income not from labour but from rent on assets that they own or control. The global elite profits not just from desirable property or money moved offshore, but also from \u201cintangible assets\u201d: financial instruments such as stocks, derivatives and securities, or intellectual property, including brands and patents. While economists such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/thomas-piketty\">Thomas Piketty</a> see capitalism necessarily tending towards rising inequality because of its own \u201cfundamental laws\u201d, Standing blames inequality on the \u201crentier capitalism\u201d that has flourished since the 1970s. This, he argues, has corrupted the dream of the free market. If capitalism is to work for the many not the few, what\u2019s needed is what Keynes called the \u201ceuthanasia of the rentier\u201d.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Power today lies not with those who control the means of production, but the 'technological apparatus'</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Standing shows in relentless detail how the institutional architecture of modern capitalism is geared to benefit rentiers. When cancer drugs are overpriced, it\u2019s because monopolies in the form of patents are granted to private \u201cowners\u201d of inventions, who get rent from their manufacture. When governments break trade agreements, they can be sued, generating income for the litigating company. When you use Airbnb, you\u2019re not part of the sharing economy but of \u201cplatform capitalism\u201d, a term Standing uses to describe how digital platforms act as labour brokers, extracting rent from every transaction (often 20%, sometimes more). These and other new technologies have enabled the outsourcing and offshoring of production, ever greater capital mobility, and make corporations more fluid and flexible. Unlike in the past, power today lies not with corporations that control the means of production, but with those that control the \u201ctechnological apparatus\u201d. </p> <p>And governments are helping them. British corporation and wealth taxes are lower than income taxes, which favours rentiers. The privatisation of \u201cthe commons\u201d \u2013 from the water supply to parks to bus services \u2013 not only hurts those who lose subsidised access to them, but increases inequality by adding to the wealth of their new owners. The replacement of student maintenance grants with loans doesn\u2019t simply deny poorer students access to education and leave them with up to \u00a353,000 of debt; the Student Loans Company also wins.</p> <p>Even policies that appear to help the precariat end up favouring rentiers. When incomes are topped up through tax credits, employers lower wages \u2013 and pocket more themselves. In an age of mounting private debt and stagnating wages \u2013 where <a href=\"http://www.thisismoney.co.uk/money/saving/article-3813659/16-million-people-working-age-100-savings-study-shows.html\">17 million Britons have less than \u00a3100 savings</a>, and house prices in England and Wales are on average nine times local annual incomes \u2013 tax breaks on savings, charitable donations and firms\u2019 debt repayments act as subsidies for the rentier class. The policies of the great recession, like the bank bailouts and quantitative easing, are likewise subsidies for the asset-rich.</p> <p>What is to be done? <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/paul-mason\">Paul Mason</a> and others who use the idea of the precariat say that the same technologies now accelerating the new rentierism will free us from work in a postcapitalist future. Standing is less optimistic. Networks of information and ideas, he argues, are already lucrative sources of rental income. And work isn\u2019t disappearing, but simply changing \u2013 in contradictory ways that neither the \u201cpostwork\u201d theorists nor the \u201clabourism\u201d of the old left have grasped. The former ignore that the technologies that change work will increase inequality. Trade unionists and social democrats, Standing argues, have not yet dealt with the fact that today, as the nine-to\u2011five career declines, we do more unpaid work in proportion to our paid labour: we work out of hours, at home and when we look for jobs \u2013 work that may not be economically productive. Hourly wage rates have therefore fallen even more than statistics show. At the same time, the kind of work that was previously done for free in private \u2013 housework, or taking care of elderly relatives \u2013 has become low-paid labour for others. Low-paid work now is not in factories but care work in nursing homes.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Work is no longer the road to riches, or even the way out of poverty. There may be more work, but it pays less</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>For Standing, what matters is that technologies are destroying the way our income and earnings have been distributed. A new \u201crental wedge\u201d has been created \u2013 between profits, which are growing, and ever more concentrated, and wages, which are falling and ever more uncertain. Work is no longer the road to riches, or even the way out of poverty. There may be more work, but it pays less. So the workplace should not be the site of struggle; the euthanasia of the rentier, Standing claims, requires more than powerful unions and higher minimum wages. That is why the \u201cenfeebled\u201d proletariat, too wedded to exhausted forms of social democracy, cannot lead a revolt. It falls to the precariat, the other group that doesn\u2019t benefit from rentier capitalism, to challenge it.</p> <p>Standing provides a compelling list of demands it should make \u2013 the regulation of labour brokers, the end of the \u201crent-seeking apparatus\u201d that is a flaw of the intellectual property regime and, crucially, a new income distribution system based around two pillars: first, an unconditional universal basic income \u2013 a policy advocated by both libertarian right and left; second, the institution of democratic sovereign wealth funds to pool and redistribute rental income. Together these would pave the way for a society in which waged work does not determine income, and rents are widely distributed.</p> <p>This is a fascinating book that builds on a lifetime of empirical research, but its politics are hard to pin down. Standing is not advocating the redistribution of work or common ownership of assets, or union politics (even though today\u2019s unions increasingly organise beyond the shopfloor). He wants policies that can mobilise defenders of free markets, too. Yet he sees rentiers as parasites producing nothing of value, and sometimes suggests only income earned through \u201chard work\u201d can be deserved. This is an idea long out of fashion: it slips easily into a quasi-Victorian moralising distinction between deserving and undeserving poor, and a glorification of work that produces real material goods. Standing doesn\u2019t go there, but implicitly inverts the categories to apply to a deserving and undeserving rich. It\u2019s not capitalist profits that bother him, nor does he differentiate between the divergent interests of small and large businesses. The problem is the idle speculator who gives nothing back.</p> <p>This is an idea with broad appeal. While the factory owner of yesteryear was involved in productive activities, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/goldmansachs\">Goldman Sachs</a> \u2013 sometimes described as a \u201cvampire squid\u201d \u2013 is not. But the contrast shows Standing\u2019s real concern: to purify and socialise capitalism, returning to a morality of rewarding hard work even as he rejects labourism. Capitalism, on this view, can be saved from the excesses of the vampire squid. For those who want its overthrow, Marx and Engels are still a better guide.</p> <p><em>\u2022 The Corruption of Capitalism: Why Rentiers Thrive and Work Does Not Pay</em> is published by Biteback.

Why on earth am I discussing Donald Trump\u2019s presidential ambitions with the former Scotland and Liverpool striker Ian St John? Because he met him, 25 years ago, in New York, and for the fifth-round draw of the Rumbelows Cup.</p> <p>You may well have seen the clip by now given it\u2019s been doing the rounds for some time, spreading across social media and feeling like an almighty trick of the mind.

Running from 1985 to 1992, it consisted of interviews, previews, goals, gaffes and, at seemingly regular intervals, St John chuckling at his television partner\u2019s attempts at what would now be referred to as \u201cbanter\u201d.</p> <p>It was a winning combination and in December 1991 led to the most unlikely of meetings.</p> <p>\u201cWe were in New York to film the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yKVt1pAiqSM\">qualifying draw for the 1994 World Cup</a>, which was to be held in America,\u201d St John, now aged 78, remembers. \u201cIt was the idea of our producer, Bob Patience, who is sadly no longer with us, and I was really excited by going over. \u2018That\u2019ll do me!\u2019 I said to Bob.</p> <p>\u201cThere was a problem, though \u2013 Jimmy hated flying.

His secretary at the time was English and upon spotting St John and Greaves in the lobby of Trump Tower as Patience sought permission to film there, she wandered over for a chat.

I think the appeal for Donald was being on a TV show that had a large audience in Britain.

He respected the fact Jimmy and I were former pros and asked about that as the crew set up to film the draw. We also had a good chat about golf as he was really into that and we played a bit. But, as I say, he had no idea about football and certainly no idea what Rumbelows was. We didn\u2019t bother explaining it to him.\u201d</p> <p>The draw took place in Trump\u2019s boardroom, or perhaps <em>one </em>of his boardrooms given we\u2019re talking about a <a href=\"http://www.trump.com/real-estate-portfolio/new-york-ny/trump-tower/\">68-storey building here</a>. It\u2019s not made clear in the clip but, either way, Greaves was certainly impressed with his surroundings. \u201cI haven\u2019t seen a boardroom like this since I was in Doug Ellis\u2019s at Aston Villa!\u201d he\u2019s seen saying in the now widely watched clip of the draw, which leads to collective laughter, with no one laughing harder than Trump despite the fact he clearly has no idea what the Englishman across the glistening oak table was talking about.</p> <p>Trump is dressed in a light blue shirt and a dark blue tie and first grabs our attention with a smug look to camera. He looks really young, despite the fact he was 45 at the time.

Ridiculous now, ridiculous then.</p> <p>Dent doesn\u2019t waste any time getting proceedings under way. After a quick introduction to camera he states Greaves, who is sitting to his left, will draw the home teams while Trump, who is to his right, will draw the away teams.

A solid if unspectacular start.</p> <p>Back to Greaves: No3 \u2013 Swindon Town or Crystal Palace.</p> <p>Back to Trump: No8 \u2013 Nottingham Forest or Southampton.</p> <p>A horribly indecisive tie and no doubt very confusing for Trump given the involvement of four teams, one of which sounds like a glass castle.</p> <p>Tie three and finally some excitement as Greaves pulls out No2 \u2013 Peterborough United. \u201cWell done Jim, that\u2019s a good one for them,\u201d says St John out of shot.</p> <p>Peterborough were in the Third Division at the time and had reached the quarter-finals courtesy of a shock 1-0 victory over Liverpool in the previous round.

Take my advice, you can open one in Leeds but don\u2019t go to Manchester!\u201d</p> <p>By now Greaves is on a roll and takes it upon himself to ask Trump if he\u2019s ever played football before. \u201cI used to play,\u201d the tycoon replies. \u201cIt\u2019s a great game, I love soccer, I played actually in high school.\u201d He sounds convincing but given the things we\u2019ve heard from the 70-year-old\u2019s mouth during the presidential campaign it\u2019s probably best to take the idea of a teenage Trump shouting: \u201cGet it in the mixer, lads!\u201d with a pinch of salt.</p> <p>There\u2019s also some talk about the upcoming World Cup \u2013 \u201cIt\u2019ll be interesting to see how it catches on in the United States,\u201d Trump muses \u2013 before Greaves draws proceedings to an end by presenting the host with a Saints and Greavsie mug. \u201cThis is the most prestigious award in footballing history,\u201d the former goal-scorer says before informing Trump that if he pours hot coffee into the vessel, \u201cFunny Old Game\u201d will appear on one side.</p> <p>\u201cPresident Bush or Frank Sinatra haven\u2019t got one of those,\u201d Greaves adds as Trumps accepts his new gift and, remembering the moment, St John lets out one of his trademark chuckles. \u201cJimmy\u2019s the biggest piss taker I\u2019ve ever met and Donald wouldn\u2019t know a piss taker if he tripped over one!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut he took it all in good spirits and afterwards shook our hands and thanked us for coming.

  "<p>Chekhov\u2019s The Cherry Orchard casts a long shadow. I\u2019ve seen countless plays about bereft British aristos pining over their lost property. Bonnie Greer, however, goes a step further by transposing the action to a Michigan resort hotel, owned by a once-rich, upper-class black family, on the eve of the presidential election. The result is ingenious but seems torn between distilling the Chekhovian poetry and charting the panic prompted by a possible Trump victory.</p> <p>Greer preserves the structure of Chekhov\u2019s play and finds contemporary equivalents for its characters. Anita is a stylish grandee who cherishes her old house as much for the fact that Bessie Smith and Ella Fitzgerald stayed there as for its cherry orchard. Her brother, Augustus, is a thrice-divorced playboy and round-the-world yachtsman, while her two daughters, Lorraine and Chirlane, seek to break free from their dominant mother. But, as in the original, the crumbling estate is up for grabs: the difference is that this time the entrepreneurial Karim has plans for it to be bought by a consortium who want to exploit the Cerise brand.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c0654f504c563eaba31c858506da9a8981f0c56f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c0654f504c563eaba31c858506da9a8981f0c56f/0_240_3600_2160/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Hotel Cerise by Bonnie Greer Inspired by Chekhov.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2016/oct/19/bonnie-greer-black-lives-matter-hotel-cerise-interview\">Bonnie Greer: 'Black Lives Matter is a big fail for my generation'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Greer successfully charts the internal dynamics of a divided family: the elders, conscious of their status, cling to a romanticised past, while the young are fiercely radical. In one of the best scenes, Anita also hints at the strain on a black elite of preserving a facade of superiority when she says \u201cwe scream every second and they think it\u2019s singing\u201d.</p> <p>But what is latent in Chekhov \u2013 the sense of a society on the threshold of momentous change \u2013 becomes blatant in Greer. The most obvious example is the way the original\u2019s symbolic use of the sound of a breaking string here becomes an earth-tremor that throws everyone flat on the ground. </p> <p>Greer has, in fact, grafted a modern political play on to a classic source. Toussaint, the equivalent of Chekhov\u2019s wandering student, is a potential revolutionary, working on a book about Obama called Alas, Poor Barack. A local businessman is fine-tuning his assault rifle, in case Trump gets elected.

  "<p>History began for me with my mother\u2019s tales of Alfred burning the cakes and Robert the Bruce and the spider. Next came Henrietta Elizabeth Marshall\u2019s <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/ourislandstoryhi00marsuoft\">Our Island Story</a> \u2013 more kings, a few queens, some religious martyrs and the Empire. I gazed at the illustrations and wondered about lives long ago.</p> <p> One rainy day on a seaside holiday in 1957 aged 14, I bought <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosalie_Glynn_Grylls\">Rosalie Glynn Grylls</a>\u2019s<em> </em>William Godwin and his World. A good bargain at 5s, it introduced me to Mary Wollstonecraft and the English Jacobins. It proved to be the opening through which I stumbled towards the historical perspectives of those who had opposed the status quo. </p> <p> While at university in the early 1960s, the iconoclastic historian of the French revolutionary army, <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/obituary-richard-cobb-1324236.html\">Richard Cobb</a>, plunged me into studies of the crowd. I read Eric Hobsbawm, EP Thompson and Christopher Hill, whose writings were turning history upside down.</p> <p> Gradually, I realised that since the 19th century, the labour movement had awakened interest in what earlier generations of workers had done and thought, and campaigns for women\u2019s suffrage had resulted in both chronicles of emancipation and research into the lives of poor women. </p> <p> It became evident that participation in rebellion fostered new ways of seeing the past. As early as 1909, the anarchist <a href=\"https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/petr-kropotkin-the-great-french-revolution-1789-1793\">Peter Kropotkin produced a history of the French revolution</a> that focused on popular action rather than on leaders.</p> <p> When the women\u2019s liberation movement started in the late 1960s, I began looking for the women, as well as men, who had been hidden from history. Fifty years on, I am still at it. The following books are drawn from a great host of books I admire.</p> <p> <strong>1. <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/black-jacobins.html\">The Black Jacobins by CLR James</a> (1938)<br></strong>James, an exploratory Trotskyist who loathed imperialism, racism and class power in equal measure, writes graphically about the 1791 slave rebellion in the French colony of San Domingo (later Haiti) led by Toussaint L\u2019Ouverture. With calls for the French revolutionaries\u2019 liberty and equality to apply to the colonised, they overcame the whites who enslaved them, a Spanish and a British invasion and then the army sent by Napoleon Bonaparte. The memory of this revolt and of its historian have proved resilient. When I mentioned L\u2019Ouverture and James to a Haitian cab driver in New York I was given a free ride!</p> <p> <strong>2. <a href=\"http://territorialmasquerades.net/primitive-rebels/\">Primitive Rebels by Eric Hobsbawm</a> (1959)<br></strong>Packed with bandits, mobs, anarchic millenarians and wandering journeymen, this delighted me as a student. Hobsbawm, being a sage member of the Communist Party, warned against their utopianism, but I took to them like a fish to water.</p> <p> <strong>3. <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/making-of-the-english-working-class.html\">The Making of the English Working Class by EP Thompson</a> (1963)<br></strong>A wonderful treasure trove of stories about working class people rescued from the condescension of posterity, this book also presents a dynamic perspective of class and class consciousness which has influenced left history in many countries. I loved it in 1963 and love it still \u2013 though I do think he was a bit mean to the Methodists!</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/mar/23/alexei-sayle-top-10-books-by-revolutionaries\">Alexei Sayle's top 10 books about revolutionaries</a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong>4. <a href=\"http://www.katesharpleylibrary.net/n5tc3h\">The Women Incendiaries by Edith Thomas</a> (1963)<br></strong>Richard Cobb had told me about Thomas\u2019s participation in <a href=\"https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Qfq4_2xF8uUC&amp;pg=PA600&amp;lpg=PA600&amp;dq=the+Union+des+Femmes+Fran%C3%A7aises+during+the+Resistance&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=jhBxwaRIas&amp;sig=C72OeiTUYHWbOrH4xqhxEB2oP4A&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjGgtHKjvjPAhXoBsAKHXptDZUQ6AEIHjAA#v=onepage&amp;q=the%20Union%20des%20Femmes%20Fran%C3%A7aises%20during%20the%20Resistance&amp;f=false\">the Union des Femmes Fran\u00e7aises during the Resistance</a> which left her familiar with barricades.

Reproduction was being politicised. Gordon\u2019s pioneering approach to birth control made the connection to the political, social, economic and cultural self\u2013determination that feminists were demanding.

It tells of the role of women in a peasant uprising against the autocratic power of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nizam_of_Hyderabad#List_of_Nizams_of_Hyderabad_.281724.E2.80.931948.29\">the last Nizam of Hyderabad in 1947</a>. The accounts are particularly moving because the women\u2019s lives were so circumscribed and they risked everything. Most interesting for me, it probes how people live on after failure. In 1951, the communists who had supported them changed tack, leaving the rebels stranded. One woman observes: \u201cThe dreams were smashed.

Faderman extends the initial focus on romantic friendships and bohemian experimenting by looking at the military in the second world war and the growth of bars and clubs in the repressive McCarthy era. She also explores the complex emergence of a movement from a series of subcultures. This is a great tribute to the ingenuity of women forced to express their desires through subterfuge.</p> <p> <strong>9. <a href=\"http://www.katesharpleylibrary.net/3bk3zs\">Emma Goldman: A Documentary History of the American Years, Volume One (2003) and Volume Two (2005)</a><br tabindex=\"-1\"></strong>The anarchist Emma Goldman was a woman of many causes \u2013 free speech, women\u2019s emancipation, birth control and workers\u2019 rights.

  "<p>For the most part, the mythology around Neutral Milk Hotel has existed beyond their control. Their singer and leader, Jeff Mangum, is <a href=\"http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/music_box/2008/02/the_salinger_of_indie_rock.html\">certainly a part-recluse</a>, but beyond anything he\u2019s simply a man who called it quits at the very moment his band saw their name in lights. By shunning interviews, he\u2019s subsequently been billed as either a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/jdsalinger\">JD Salinger</a>-like enigma or a modern-day <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/jan/06/nick-kent-pink-floyd-syd-barrett-classic-profile-creem-1973\">Syd Barrett</a>. These are two exaggerated interpretations, coined largely because the band, who split in 1999, have barely said a word since then.</p> <p>The trouble is, they departed with a record that remains hard to explain. Unintentionally, they timed their disbandment with the rise of music-forum discussions, <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5758-in-the-aeroplane-over-the-sea/\">Pitchfork\u2019s holy grail perfect-score verdicts</a> and the internet\u2019s tendency to give hearsay a bigger platform than concrete facts: Neutral Milk Hotel ended just when mythology became a crucial factor in propelling a band\u2019s reputation, and in the absence of anything to diminish them, their reputation simply grew and grew and grew.<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"bbccea675113605a8c96a1c40184ac9bfb4c67b4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bbccea675113605a8c96a1c40184ac9bfb4c67b4/48_70_2026_2672/758.jpg\" alt=\"Neutral Milk Hotel\" width=\"758\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Hard to explain \u2026 Neutral Milk Hotel.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Merge Records</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>That\u2019s not to say the 1998 album that made their name, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2006/nov/03/urban.popandrock\">In the Aeroplane Over the Sea</a>, isn\u2019t a phenomenal record. Born from Mangum\u2019s bizarre, brutally heartfelt interpretation of The Diary of Anne Frank, it shuns reality and historical interpretations for surrealist imagery, Bulgarian street music, drone sections and a lifetime\u2019s supply of fuzz pedals.<br></p> <p>In the Aeroplane Over the Sea went on to inform the following decade\u2019s biggest alternative breakthroughs, from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/arcadefire\">Arcade Fire</a>\u2019s rousing collective cries to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/beirut\">Beirut</a>\u2019s well-travelled spirit. You can even hear the splintering emotion mirrored on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/2016/sep/24/bon-iver-justin-vernon-22-million-interview\">Bon Iver</a>\u2019s cabin-feverish debut, For Emma, Forever Ago. And the record is so crammed full of the frontman\u2019s subtle, autobiographical references, it\u2019s still being decoded 18 years on. By disappearing, they allowed word of mouth to set the agenda and In the Aeroplane attained the status of being the one indie record you had to hear. Mangum\u2019s unique lyricism, combined with his reclusion, only enhanced fever around the band. Perhaps Frank Ocean took a leaf out of his book when realising that the less you talk, the more people want to hear what you have to say.<br></p> <p>By the time the wheels came off, Neutral Milk Hotel were already enjoying cult status. One of the reasons they split is that Mangum found it hard to deal with the attention he started to get. \u201cJeff\u2019s a very private person,\u201d Bill Doss, co-founder of <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6hkVXpQYYg\">the Olivia Tremor Control</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2011/mar/10/elephant-6-jeff-mangum-deerhunter\">told the Guardian</a>, \u201cand kids were freaking out over him.

The band\u2019s early converts were on board for life, and shows soon had the status of being emotionally overwhelming, must-see experiences. But the group still enjoyed the freedom to write and record with little-to-no expectation, sharing communal spaces in Athens, Georgia; making music with zero regard for time of day or final product.</p> <p>That goes some way to explaining Mangum\u2019s sudden reluctance to pursue the project as soon as it took off. Involved in cassette culture and DIY collectives from an early age, music was a free-spirited outlet for him. Once he realised it was not what he had imagined it to be, he decided enough was enough. As he told Pitchfork, in a <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/features/interview/5847-neutral-milk-hotel/\">rare interview in 2002</a>: \u201cI went through a period, after Aeroplane, when a lot of the basic assumptions I held about reality started crumbling. I guess I had this idea that if we all created our dream we could live happily ever after. So when so many of our dreams had come true and yet I still saw that so many of my friends were in a lot of pain \u2026 I realised I can\u2019t just sing my way out of all this suffering.\u201d Given how many bands today tend to press on before fading out with a whimper, his decision to go out with a bang seems admirable. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"139fde92d306c4b0e31ec2bb46d30564da91644c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/139fde92d306c4b0e31ec2bb46d30564da91644c/0_130_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"NMH perform a reunion show at Fun Fun Fun festival, in Austin, Texas, 2014.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">NMH perform a reunion show at Fun Fun Fun festival, in Austin, Texas, 2014.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Merrick Ales/FilmMagic</span> </figcaption> </figure> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/may/23/neutral-milk-hotel-jeff-mangum-roundhouse-review\">Neutral Milk Hotel review \u2013 it's thrilling to have Jeff Mangum back from the brink</a> </p> </aside>  <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/may/23/neutral-milk-hotel-jeff-mangum-roundhouse-review\">A reunion tour</a> in 2013 did little to tarnish the Neutral Milk Hotel legacy. Proceeds went to a charity aimed at improving the lives of Mongolian children, and they weren\u2019t billed beyond the hype in nostalgic festival headline slots. And by not caving in and releasing another record in conjunction with a tour, they helped keep things on their terms. Everyone\u2019s accounts of the reunion shows are wildly different. Depending on who you ask, these comeback gigs were either religious experiences or bitter disappointments. But most crucially, Neutral Milk Hotel remained a source of personal investment. Every one of the band\u2019s fans has their own epiphany, an individual account of the first time they were struck down by what they heard. By opening up these moments to a new generation, or simply those who missed the boat last time round, Mangum finally managed to hold the ropes of his band\u2019s mythology. </p>",

But May deliberately included a strong attack on the European convention on human rights, knowing it would be widely, but inaccurately, portrayed as evidence of being a secret Brexiter at heart regardless of the fact the ECHR has nothing to do with the EU.</p> <p>Since becoming prime minister May has had to accept the result of the Brexit vote. In the process she has recalibrated her public rhetoric on Brexit by qualifying the need for British companies to have \u201cthe maximum freedom to trade and operate in the single market\u201d by saying it must not be at the expense of \u201cgiving up control of immigration again\u201d. She has also promised Britain will not accept rulings from the EU\u2019s European court of justice.</p> <p>These carefully calculated shifts in language have led some to conclude she is now set on the path to hard Brexit.

  "<p>The road on which Theresa May currently finds herself is well travelled. Most successful politicians rely on a kind of necessary deception, projecting authenticity and credibility while conducting business in the only way that political business can be conducted: by negotiation.

But at neither event did she suggest, as she did in her <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/05/theresa-may-speech-tory-conference-panel-verdict\">conference speech earlier this month</a>, that curtailing free movement must take priority over membership of the single market, nor advocate, as her home secretary did, that employers <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/oct/04/rudd-announces-crackdown-on-overseas-students-and-new-work-visas\">count their foreign workers</a>, or that the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/13/zero-chance-eu-citizens-keep-same-rights-post-brexit-expert\">fate of EU citizens in Britain </a>might be a matter for negotiation. Quite the opposite in fact: in her on-the-record speech in April, she actually said that while free movement rules make it harder to control European immigration <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/home-secretarys-speech-on-the-uk-eu-and-our-place-in-the-world\">\u201cthey do not mean we cannot control the border\u201d</a>.</p> <p>Since 23 June, Mrs May has said scarcely a kind word about the EU. This is not necessarily dishonourable: her rhetoric has been aimed at persuading the 52% who voted leave that she feels what they feel. She is marching to their tune. A consequence of the binary choice of a referendum as opposed to the choice between programmes offered by a general election is that it appears to deliver a single message that politicians are obliged to honour. We are all learning how to manage the consequences.</p> <p>That is more or less the official line from No 10 this morning, in the wake of the Guardian\u2019s story about her private speech: \u201cWe are working to make a success of this new opportunity.\u201d</p> <p>But this is no way to rebuild the confidence of voters in the good intentions of politicians. May is overinterpreting the result, using it to construct headlines and justify policies that are not borne out by the subsequent analysis of the no vote \u2013 which shows that it was neither exclusively among poorer people, nor mainly motivated by anti-migration sentiment \u2013 and then using it to promote division. This is not leading, it is following.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>May is establishing herself as one of the most evasive of modern prime ministers. This is a lethal electoral strategy</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Healing the divisions that the referendum exposed does not mean acting as if all the right was on one side. That is democracy as the tyranny of the majority. Often, it is clear that May does really understand that. On the steps of Downing Street as the new prime minister in July, she began by acknowledging the kind of institutional injustice that makes people feel powerless, and she talked persuasively of an economy that works for all. That is the tone of voice that the post-referendum country needs.</p> <p>May is already establishing herself as one of the most evasive of modern prime ministers. The psychologist Peter Bull <a href=\"http://theconversation.com/theresa-may-has-a-very-special-technique-for-avoiding-questions-67424\">describes her as a sphinx-like equivocator</a>, author of a new technique of never giving a specific answer to a direct question. This is a lethal electoral strategy.</p> <p>The Theresa May who talked to the smart kids at Goldman Sachs a couple of months earlier might have allowed her audience to influence her tone of voice. She might have thought that her words would remain unreported. But I think that was the authentic Theresa May. She should remember that authenticity is the quality voters most value. And she should reframe her message about Brexit to reflect her real concerns before she leads a car-crash departure with all the miserable consequences that she foresaw when she was talking the truth to the city slickers.</p>",
  "<p>The European commission has dropped plans to legally limit a pervasive but naturally occurring chemical found in food, that is linked to cancer, just days after lobbying by industry, the Guardian has learned.</p> <p>Campaigners say that leaked documents revealing the legislative retreat show \u201cundue influence\u201d by the food industry over EU law-making and a \u201cpermanent scandal\u201d, although the issue is complex.</p> <p>Acrylamide is a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2002/aug/15/food.foodanddrink\">hazardous substance found in the browned and burned parts of common starchy foods</a> that have been fried, roasted or oven-cooked at temperatures higher than 248C (478F).</p> <p>Crisps, potato chips, breakfast cereals and instant coffee all contain high levels of the substance, as do baby foods, biscuits and rusks.</p> <p>Scientists are still trying to quantify the health risks posed, but acrylamide has been judged <a href=\"https://www.bnl.gov/esh/env/compliance/docs/SaraTitleList.pdf\">an \u201cextremely hazardous substance\u201d</a> by the US Environmental Protection Agency.</p> <p>Last year, the European Food Safety Authority (Efsa) <a href=\"https://www.efsa.europa.eu/en/press/news/150604\">found that</a> acrylamide \u201cpotentially increases the risk of developing cancer in consumers of all ages\u201d and recommended that exposure be kept as low as possible, as a safe limit has not yet been determined.</p> <p>\u201cSince any level of exposure to a genotoxic substance could potentially damage DNA and lead to cancer, Efsa\u2019s scientists conclude that they cannot set a tolerable daily intake (TDI) of acrylamide in food,\u201d the authority <a href=\"https://www.efsa.europa.eu/sites/default/files/corporate_publications/files/acrylamide150604.pdf\">said</a>. </p> <p>Acrylamide levels can be reduced by using different ingredients and additives, or by changing storage methods and the temperature at which food is cooked.</p> <p>But this could affect food industry practice, costs and product tastes, and EU legislation in the area has so far been confined to voluntary codes of practice.</p> <p>An EU regulation this year had been expected to firm these codes up into more robust public health protections and a draft version produced in late June seen by the Guardian took steps in that direction.</p> <p>It called on the food industry to \u201cprovide evidence of regular testing of their products to ensure that the application of the code of practice is effective in keeping acrylamide levels as low as reasonably achievable and at least below the indicative levels referred to in Annex 3.\u201d</p> <p>This annex set benchmarks for acrylamide levels in a range of foods, including: crisps, crackers, soft bread, breakfast cereals, biscuits, wafers, gingerbread, coffees, biscuits and baby foods.</p> <p>But the paper was shared with an industry association, Food Drink Europe, which immediately complained to the commission in a letter seen by the Guardian, saying that \u201cthe terminology \u2018at least below the indicative value\u2019 could be interpreted as meaning that the indicative values are maximum limits\u201d.</p> <p>Within days, the offending reference had been removed from a second draft of the law, which was then sent out for broader public consultation.</p> <p>Martin Pigeon, a spokesman for Corporate Europe Observatory said that the documents showed the European commission\u2019s original good intentions had been \u201cannihilated\u201d by industry pressure.</p> <p>\u201cThis is yet another case of the meaningless regulations obtained when giving industry too much say about its own regulation,\u201d he told the Guardian. \u201cThe European commission\u2019s endemic practice of secretly sharing draft regulatory texts with relevant industry lobby groups months before they are publicly known is a permanent scandal which needs to stop.\u201d<br> </p> <p>Nusa Urbancic, campaign director for ChangingMarkets.org said: \u201cThese leaked documents show that the industry is having an undue influence over the process and contents of this proposal. Their call for indicative values for different food groups clearly hasn\u2019t worked so far, as acrylamide levels are as high as ever, according to Efsa data. Ambitious maximum limits are needed to protect consumers.\u201d</p> <p>The European commission has updated the proposed acrylamide law in recent weeks, to at least include a triannual review of the voluntary framework.</p> <p>Some commission sources say that bolder, more binding measures will be threatened in a final draft, if the food industry does not take the acrylamide issue more seriously.</p> <p>But Camille Perrin, the senior food policy officer for the European consumer organisation, BEUC, said that an impact assessment would be needed for that to happen, because of the Jean-Claude Juncker commission\u2019s <a href=\"http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-15-4988_en.htm\">\u201cbetter regulation\u201d agenda</a>. She suggested that the original proposal had been misinterpreted.</p> <p>\u201cFrom a legal perspective the wording might not have made a big difference as these values are not meant to be legal limits,\u201d Perrin said. \u201cWhile we would like to see binding limits, I\u2019m not sure that what was being proposed would have been enough to make these values legal values.\u201d</p> <p>More than 150,000 people have so far signed <a href=\"https://actions.sumofus.org/a/eu-protect-our-food-safety\">a petition</a> calling for the EU to set legally binding acrylamide limits, and a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvIEUTin2XA\">social media campaign</a> is also underway. </p>",

J\u00f3nsd\u00f3ttir says she has no ambition to be prime minister, pointing to the Pirate party\u2019s horizontal structure. Rather, she wants to sweep away what she sees as Iceland\u2019s dysfunctional system. </p> \n<p>\u201cPeople in Iceland are sick of corruption and nepotism,\u201d <a href=\"http://birgitta.is/92-2/\">she has said</a>. She likens Iceland to <a href=\"https://newint.org/features/2015/01/01/democracy-digital-era-keynote/\">a chilly North Atlantic version of Sicily</a>, ruled by a few \u201cmafia-style families\u201d plus their friends, whom she nicknames \u201cthe Octopus\u201d. </p> \n<p>Of her political movement, she says: \u201cWe do not define ourselves as left or right but rather as a party that focuses on the systems. In other words, we consider ourselves hackers \u2013 so to speak \u2013 of our current outdated systems of government.\u201d<br></p> \n<p>This anti-establishment message has resonated with large swaths of Iceland\u2019s 320,000-strong population, especially the young. On Monday J\u00f3nsd\u00f3ttir and two party colleagues <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/58zq55/we_are_the_icelandic_pirate_party_leading_the/\">took part in an AMA</a>, or \u201cask me anything\u201d, on Reddit. Their wide-ranging discussion covered the EU (the Pirates would put Iceland\u2019s membership application to a referendum), fishing quotas, whaling, climate change and the party\u2019s name.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re called the Pirate party in reference to a global movement of Pirate parties that popped up over the last decade,\u201d parliamentary candidate Sm\u00e1ri McCarthy explained. \u201cDespite our name, we\u2019re taken fairly seriously in Iceland, in particular because of our very aggressive anti-corruption stance, [and] our pro-transparency work.\u201d</p> \n<p>A <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Icelandic_parliamentary_election,_2016#Opinion_polls\">poll last week</a> put the Pirates, who hang a black pirate flag in their parliamentary office, on nearly 21% of the vote. This is far short of the 40%-plus it was polling at the height of mass anti-government protests this spring, but enough to leave a combination of it and the Left-Green party, on 19%, just 10 points short of a majority.<br></p> \n<p>The Pirate party has <a href=\"http://icelandmonitor.mbl.is/news/politics_and_society/2016/10/17/iceland_s_pirates_gun_for_anti_government_grand_all/\">ruled out</a> any possibility of forming a coalition with either of the current two ruling parties, the centre-right Independence party and centrist Progressive party. It says it hopes to form a pre-election alliance with supportive parties so voters can \u201cknow what their vote will mean\u201d. </p> \n<p>All too often in Icelandic politics, the party says, electoral pledges are reneged on after elections, with \u201cthe parties forming a government \u2026 hiding behind compromises in coalition \u2013 enabling them to cheat voters again and again\u201d.</p> \n<p> Saturday\u2019s election was prompted by the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/apr/05/iceland-prime-minister-resigns-over-panama-papers-revelations\">resignation of Iceland\u2019s prime minister</a> Sigmundur Davi\u00f0 Gunnlaugsson. He became the first major casualty of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/series/panama-papers\">Panama Papers</a> in April after the leaked legal documents revealed he and his wife had millions of pounds of family money offshore. Gunnlaugsson hadn\u2019t declared the British Virgin Islands company. </p> \n<p>This was not illegal, but the news sparked outrage and some of the largest protests that Iceland has ever seen. The ruling coalition <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2016/apr/06/icelandic-mps-call-for-fresh-elections-after-pm-resigns\">replaced Gunnlaugsson with the agriculture and fisheries minister Sigur\u00f0ur Ingi J\u00f3hannsson</a> and promised elections before the end of this year.</p> \n<p>Gunnlaugsson\u2019s Progressive party is now languishing at about 8% in the polls, barely a third of its score in the 2013 elections. Support for the Independence party, the Pirates\u2019 rival for the position of largest party, seems to be holding.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"947b13170e6ddcee9ec87fb62cbacdefb8a92d05\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/947b13170e6ddcee9ec87fb62cbacdefb8a92d05/624_93_2736_1642/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Birgitta J\u00f3nsd\u00f3ttir\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Birgitta J\u00f3nsd\u00f3ttir.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tim Knox/Tim Knox (commissioned)</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>J\u00f3nsd\u00f3ttir, the Pirates\u2019 parliamentary leader, has said her party is willing to form a government with any party that subscribes to its agenda of \u201cfundamental system change\u201d, including the introduction of a new, crowdsourced national constitution. </p> \n<p>It strongly advocates greater protection for whistleblowers. Its first ever bill proposed back in 2013 was on granting Snowden asylum. J\u00f3nsd\u00f3ttir attracted international attention in 2010 when she worked with Julian Assange on a leaked video which revealed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/apr/05/wikileaks-us-army-iraq-attack\">US helicopter pilots killing two Reuters journalists on the streets of Baghdad. </a></p> \n<p>Built on the belief that new technologies can help <a href=\"http://piratar.is/en/core-policy/\">promote civic engagement and government transparency and accountability</a>, the Pirates also advocate an \u201cunlimited right\u201d for citizens to be involved in political decision-making. It wants voters to be able to propose new legislation and decide on it in national referendums.<br></p> \n<p>The Pirate party is part of a global anti-establishment trend typified by parties on the left such as Syriza in Greece and Podemos in Spain, and on the right such as Germany\u2019s AfD and Britain\u2019s Ukip. As well as promising to accept Bitcoin as legal tender, Iceland\u2019s Pirates have pledged to maintain the country\u2019s economic stability. </p> \n<p>Iceland has recovered economically since the 2008 crash, when Iceland\u2019s three biggest banks collapsed; owing 11 times the country\u2019s GDP. Reykjav\u00edk\u2019s stock market fell 97% and the value of the krona halved. Helped by a tourism boom \u2013 2.4 million visitors, nearly seven times the country\u2019s population, are expected in 2017 \u2013 economic growth is forecast to reach 4.3% this year, and unemployment has fallen to just over 3%.</p> \n<p>Unlike some other anti-establishment parties, the Pirates have made clear they have no intention of doing anything likely to upset the economy.

  "<p>I recently watched a powerful discussion of the importance of role models, after the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/14/the-guardian-view-on-women-in-theatre-a-leading-role-please-not-just-a-bit-part\" title=\"\">all-female production of The Tempest</a> that\u2019s currently showing in London.

Whether that\u2019s because other people will be more amenable, or because of the psychological boost that comes from not being the odd one out, it remains true that not being the first is of infinite benefit.</p> <p>But what happens when you have to be the first? I\u2019ve occupied this position for much of my life. Not only was I the first visibly disabled person to go to any of the schools I attended, I am often the first disabled person many people I encounter seem to have met or spoken to. This status can announce itself subtly, but surely. I\u2019ll notice a sidelong look at my personal assistant, a pause in conversation, while the person tries to work out if everything is \u201cOK\u201d \u2013 by which they mean: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/sep/24/disability-and-the-new-normal-why-australia-needs-to-ramp-up-access-to-stage-and-screen\" title=\"\">normal</a>. While this is my normal, it is, I realised as I listened to the after-show discussion, quite an odd situation to be in \u2013 and one that can sometimes leave me drained. I feel compelled to be bubbly and, crucially, to crack a few jokes, because that\u2019s the easiest way to break through \u2013 to go from \u201cwheelchair user\u201d to \u201cperson\u201d.</p> <p>Being the first disabled person in a setting can lead to some strange situations. A particular incident springs to mind. I was 11 years old and my new school had taken my year on a \u201cteam building\u201d day to an adventure park. The aim of the day was to climb things and build things and somehow make friends along the way. As I could neither climb nor build, I was left to make suggestions from afar, feeling incredibly awkward as the teachers encouraged the others to remember I was there. It is safe to say I did not make any friends.</p> <p>The issue was not that I was left out, far from it. Instead, by trying to include me in things I could not do, the day served only to highlight that I was different. I knew, and everyone else knew, that I stuck out like a sore thumb \u2013 a feeling that followed me for the next seven years of education. Every time I watched sports day from the sidelines or had to be carried upstairs to my music lessons by the school caretaker (it is unclear why no one thought to move the class), they made the mistake of including to the point of exclusion. And I was very aware that this all came down to the fact that no one really knew what to do, because I was the first.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Society shouldn\u2019t need you to follow a set path in order to be able to accept what you\u2019re doing</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>I am reminded of those feelings every time someone briefly panics when I start a conversation or is surprised that I am a writer (\u201cOh, good for you,\u201d they say, \u201cwell done\u201d). I am reminded that I am still one of the few when I manage to secure some work experience, only to be told that the office isn\u2019t accessible, sorry. And I am reminded of it when, sometimes \u2013 with every phone call in advance to check access, every explanation that, no, I can\u2019t use the tube \u2013 going about daily life feels like wading through treacle.</p> <p>It needn\u2019t be so. Society shouldn\u2019t need you to follow a set path in order to be able to accept what you\u2019re doing without question or confusion. We need to, collectively, make fewer assumptions, from the seemingly innocuous (that I can only write about disability, that a woman can\u2019t be Prospero) to the more serious (that I can\u2019t possibly have a job, that a young person from an ethnic minority isn\u2019t drama school material). It is possible to respect someone\u2019s choices and bravery without being patronising, and it is possible to recognise difference without surprise, and yet many fail at these basic tasks of acceptance. Simple changes to these behaviours would make life a little easier for those who take the risk of being their own role model. If someone had thought about it, they might have realised that the adventure day was going to result in some pretty awkward situations and sent us to a museum instead.</p> <p>In 2016, being the first to try should not mean expecting a rough ride or being treated like a statistical anomaly. Up and down the country, disabled people are spending their days convincing people that they belong in a school, university or workplace, when really they should just be making choices and getting on with them. Society has work to do for that to be the reality.</p>",
  "<h2>I\u2019m excited by \u2026</h2> <p>The possibility of one more Hudson River Derby. The Red Bulls and NYC FC could face each other once again, in the playoffs and this game could be the best one yet. NYC FC, who are a totally different team <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/may/21/new-york-city-fc-red-bulls-mls-hudson-river-derby\">since the 7-0 debacle earlier this season</a>, would salivate at the prospect of facing their local rivals in the playoffs. As for Jesse Marsch\u2019s men? Another opportunity to show why they still rule New York is too good to turn down. <strong tabindex=\"-1\">LME</strong></p> <p>The fact that both of last year\u2019s finalists, the Portland Timbers and the Columbus Crew, failed to qualify for this year\u2019s playoffs bodes well for the league\u2019s famous parity. Seeing if this young squad can carry FC Dallas all the way to an unprecedented treble. The midseason turnarounds staged by DC United and Seattle. The serious possibility of an NY derby in the Eastern conference finals. And, most of all, for the cold, bitter November games at altitude in Denver, and watching how much the Rapids will make the road team suffer. <strong>GN</strong></p> <p>DC United. There\u2019s always a wildcard heading into the play-offs and DC United appear to be that side this season. Pressing questions were being asked of Ben Olsen not so long ago, but five straight wins sent them into the postseason, scoring 12 times in the process. They found their groove, a deep one. Are they 2016\u2019s Portland Timbers? <strong>GR</strong></p> <p>Some excellent teams going deep: Dallas, the Red Bulls and NYC FC have serious quality, and I fully expect them to be there at the end of it all. Even though the prospect of an unheralded team doing well is fun, I love the idea of the best teams being there in the conference finals. <strong>TH</strong></p> <h2>I\u2019m turned off by \u2026</h2> <p>The prospect of sub-par officiating. MLS refereeing is often criticized, and the fact that the stakes are now higher worries me. Being an official is extremely difficult, so my hope for 2017 is that Don Garber does everything he can to make referees\u2019 jobs easier. <strong tabindex=\"-1\">LME</strong></p> <p>The knockout games on short rest. The phrase \u201cAudi MLS Cup playoffs.\u201d Mauro Diaz\u2019s season-ending injury in the penultimate game, meaning we\u2019re robbed of the chance to see one of the league\u2019s best playmakers orchestrate the league\u2019s most scintillating attack. The way Real Salt Lake and the Montreal Impact limped into the playoffs. And, most of all, for how the goals seem to dry up once teams reach the conference finals. <strong>GN</strong></p> <p>Sporting KC. Consistency has become the calling card of Peter Vermes. KC have now made the play-offs for six successive seasons, but with defensive stability and physicality their greatest strengths they aren\u2019t exactly the most compelling side to watch. Such traits might serve them well in a knockout format, though. <strong>GR</strong></p> <p>The dreadful format. The MLS Cup final isn\u2019t until 10 December! Why we need six weeks to determine a winner is beyond me, and six teams from each conference is at least two too many. I know we live in a prizes-for-all world, but allowing the 11th- and 12th-best placed teams to compete in the postseason is a farce. <strong>TH</strong></p> <h2>The dream MLS Cup final will be \u2026</h2> <p>FC Dallas v NYC FC. Dallas are the best team in this league, and they deserve nothing less than a hat-trick of trophies this season (US Open Cup, Supporters\u2019 Shield.) In only their second year as a club, Patrick Vieira\u2019s men managed to climb enormous steps thanks to attractive, mature soccer with one of the most interesting squads in the league \u2013 and all this after losing 7-0 against the Red Bulls. Talk about comeback kings. <strong>LME</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d20486e66283e948f4f164042dfc35237c1bb35f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d20486e66283e948f4f164042dfc35237c1bb35f/0_0_3181_2130/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Boys in blue: David Villa and Andrea Pirlo.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"670\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Boys in blue: David Villa and Andrea Pirlo.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: L Argueta/ISI/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>NYCFC v LA Galaxy. Frank Lampard, David Villa and Andrea Pirlo v Steven Gerrard, Gio Dos Santos, Robbie Keane and Landon Donovan at Yankee Stadium. The league\u2019s most famous stars and the two largest media markets taking each other on for the grand prize. Never mind the tactical headache that would occur if all those players were on the pitch at once, or the nauseating amount of advertising that would accompany it, it would be a fitting swansong for the aging European DP era of MLS, right before it starts to give way to more youthful and mobile teams. <strong>GN</strong></p> <p>NYC FC v Seattle. NYC\u2019s turnaround under Patrick Vieira this season has been remarkable. He has found a shape and formation to get the best out of his big names, making Yankee Stadium a go-to-destination for goals. An MLS Cup final appearance would be symbolic of their progress. The Seattle Sounders have also completed their own turnaround, but in a much shorter timeframe. Just a few months ago they were on the brink of an existential crisis, firing Sigi Schmid after the club slipped to second bottom of the Western Conference. Since then they have won eight from 13 games, largely without Clint Dempsey, and now have real momentum behind them. You could say I fancy a common narrative of redemption. <strong>GR</strong></p> <p>Galaxy v NYC FC. It might not thrill the purists, who scorn the emphasis on highly paid veterans, but a clash between these two heavyweights would be undeniably alluring. MLS struggles to find space in the competitive US sports market, but final between the two glitziest clubs in America\u2019s two biggest cities, boasting a roster of stars and enough charisma to sink the Titanic, would help the league to gain traction. I\u2019m excited already. <strong>TH</strong></p> <h2>The actual MLS Cup final will be \u2026</h2> <p>Colorado Rapids v New York Red Bulls. The Red Bulls \u2013 thanks to their do-or-die attitude and Bradley Wright-Phillips, the league\u2019s MVP favorite \u2013 look unstoppable right now. In the West, Mauro Diaz\u2019s injury is a big deal to Dallas, and although they\u2019ll make it to the conference final, I think that might be where their season ends \u2013 yes, Diaz is that important. Enter the Rapids, who have not lost a single game at home this season and if they can hold on when they are away from Dick\u2019s Sporting Goods Park, they should make it all the way. <strong tabindex=\"-1\">LME</strong></p> <p>Speaking of young and athletic teams, the New York Red Bulls v FC Dallas. Yes, it\u2019s the easy pick because they are the respective No1 seeds, but the Red Bulls have the one-two punch of the league\u2019s golden boot winner in Bradley Wright-Phillips and assists leader in Sacha Kljestan, and FC Dallas have been the best team throughout the course of the season. To bet against either seems foolish. <strong tabindex=\"-1\">GN</strong></p> <p>Red Bulls v Rapids. Surely one of these days the New York Red Bulls will actually translate their regular season form into a play-off run? They\u2019ve been here enough times before, and their propensity for the big occasion sure to set them up well for the play-offs. The Colorado Rapids let their grasp on the Supporters\u2019 Shield slip, but Pablo Mastroeni has forged a side that doesn\u2019t lose often. They were guilty of drawing too many games in the regular season, but being able to not lose games can be more important than being able to win them in play-off soccer. <strong tabindex=\"-1\">GR</strong></p> <p>Dallas v Red Bulls. They\u2019re the two best teams in the league, and they should reach the final with relatively little problem. Colorado don\u2019t score enough goals, LA and NYC FC are too flighty, and the likes of Philly and RSL just don\u2019t have enough quality. Seattle are probably the one dark horse, but expect a Dallas-Red Bulls final. <strong>TH</strong> </p> <h2>The MLS playoff format: good or bad?</h2> <p>Somewhere in between. I enjoy the two-legged format in the conference semis and final matches, but the final needs a make-over. I love <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/oct/24/breaking-the-law-soccer-playoffs\">Beau Dure\u2019s idea</a> of a mixed two-legged final match: it balances the playing field as well as rewarding the team with the best record. Here\u2019s another one for you, not completely unrelated: too many teams qualify for the playoffs \u2013 let\u2019s make it eight instead of 12 so we can all go home sooner. It would also improve the quality of the league as a whole: fewer spots mean tougher competition. <strong>LME</strong></p> <p>Good enough. The actual format is straightforward and fair, but the scheduling makes it unnecessarily awkward. Why have midweek knockout games on two days\u2019 rest between Decision Day and the start of the conference semifinals? It makes for tired players, which makes for worse games. And then the two-week international break comes between the conference semi-finals and the conference finals, followed by a 10-day break before the MLS Cup itself. The schedule is both too truncated and too spread out; there must be a better way to distribute the dates. <strong>GN</strong></p> <p>Good \u2026 I think. MLS needs all the spectacle it can muster to draw mainstream attention, and the play-offs certainly help it do that. Pitching the best teams against each other in a knockout format is what many wish the Champions League still was. The knockout round makes it a little clunky, but other than that it works. <strong tabindex=\"-1\">GR</strong><br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Bad. It\u2019s neither one thing nor the other. Why play 34 matches per season only to have another six weeks to decide everything? Forget trying to ape the other big US sports\u2019 play-off formats: there\u2019s really no need for this protracted postseason jamboree. How about the top two from each conference play each other over two legs, and the winners face each other in a grand final on neutral territory? Easy. <strong>TH</strong></p> <h2>Team you wish had made it</h2> <p>Honestly, no one. The 12 heading to the playoffs are the most deserving, and if you\u2019re not one of them then you need to make some serious changes. Chicago once again ended up dead last in the East and Portland, last year\u2019s champions, failed to win a single game away from home. That\u2019s just not good enough. If anything I would like to make that group smaller, but I\u2019ve already beaten that drum. <strong tabindex=\"-1\">LME</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"636b2c8312caee5523cbd7138394f77f985e8370\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/636b2c8312caee5523cbd7138394f77f985e8370/0_0_5760_3840/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Kaka and Orlando City won\u2019t be participating.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Kaka and Orlando City won\u2019t be participating.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ricardo Ramirez Buxeda/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Orlando City. They only finished one point (and many tiebreakers) out of the playoff spots, but it would have been nice to see Jason Kreis get some measure of redemption after failing to get in last year with NYC FC. Although their defense wouldn\u2019t be organized enough for a deep run, their offense can be thrilling, and this might have been our last and only chance to see Cyle Larin in the playoffs before he makes the rumored switch to Europe. <strong>GN</strong></p> <p>Portland. It\u2019s not much fun when the defending champions don\u2019t get the chance to defend their title. The Portland Timbers were denied that on Sunday, simply giving themselves too much ground to make up over the final few weeks of the regular season. At their best Caleb Porter\u2019s side are among the most captivating in the league, not to mention the atmosphere and fervour big games at Providence Park boast. The play-offs are worse off without them. <strong>GR</strong><br></p> <p>The 12 play-off teams are pretty strong, and there\u2019s no huge name missing from the party, although it\u2019s perhaps disappointing that Portland won\u2019t be there to defend their title. It\u2019s a shame that Kaka hasn\u2019t made it, ditto the excellent Cyle Larin, but this group of 12 is fine. <strong>TH</strong></p> <h2>Player you wish had made it</h2> <p>Diego Fagundez. On Decision Day, the first homegrown player in New England history scored a ridiculous free-kick, as the Revs ended the season with an impressive 3-0 win against Montreal. Fagundez \u2013 who scored six goals this season \u2013 is a tricky winger who looks set have a fantastic 2017 season. Also, losing Mauro Diaz to injury is a travesty for MLS, and not just Dallas. <strong>LME</strong></p> <p>In tight play-off games, a strong finisher who can also make his own chances is worth his weight in gold. I think David Accam, with nine goals and five assists \u2013 and a better goals per 90 ratio than top tier MLS strikers like Chris Wondolowski, Yura Movsisyan, and Kei Kamara \u2013 would thrive in the play-offs. Whether he\u2019ll ever get there with Chicago is a different question altogether. <strong>GN</strong></p> <p>One of the greatest players of the past two decades has played in MLS for the past two seasons, and we have yet to see him in the play-offs. Kaka might not be the force he once was, but he remains one of the best things about North American soccer right now. It\u2019s a shame that once again he has been denied one final platform. <strong>GR</strong></p> <p>Kaka. His Orlando team are still a work in progress, but the Brazilian remains a shining star, even at 34 years old. His grace and \u00e9lan will be missed. <strong>TH</strong></p> <h2>One bold prediction</h2> <p>NYC FC will win it all. Once the play-offs start, nothing is off the table and Patrick Vieira\u2019s men, though still inconsistent at the back, are extremely dangerous going forward. No other team in the league scored more goals than NYC FC (62) this year and if they are able maintain a strong defensive shape when they are away from home, who knows what could happen. <strong>LME</strong></p> <p>For the Philadelphia Union to cause an upset on the road against Toronto. TFC have Giovinco back, but have looked far from convincing with only one win in their last six. Philly is on an even worse run of form, with seven straight games without a win. Both of these teams have backed into the play-offs, and it is hard to see TFC winning it on star power alone. This might be one where home field is more of a curse than a blessing, as the nervousness in the stands at BMO Field sometimes translates to the players on the pitch. It\u2019s a tall order for the Union, but not an impossible one. <strong>GN</strong></p> <p>Toronto FC to crash and burn. Much is expected of TFC this year, with Greg Vanney leading the maligned club to their highest ever regular season finish. But while some sides are well-equipped to deal with play-off soccer TFC appear to be the opposite. They have conceded five times in their last two outings. If they are to finally make a post-season impression they must tighten things at the back. Otherwise their attacking prowess and Sebastian Giovinco\u2019s brilliance will count for little. <strong>GR</strong></p> <p>LA Galaxy to lose at home to Real Salt Lake. LA\u2019s home form has been excellent all season, and RSL are generally rubbish on the road, but let\u2019s go big and bold: Jeff Cassar\u2019s team to win this one.<strong> TH</strong></p> <h2>The Eastern Conference final will be</h2> <p>The Hudson River Derby. I\u2019m going to be a romantic here and hope this happens. I haven\u2019t seen anything from the Red Bulls that forces me to believe they shouldn\u2019t be there and as for NYC FC, yes I know, I\u2019ve been heavy on them today but guess what? The table doesn\u2019t lie. Quite simply, these are the best two teams in the East. <strong>LME</strong></p> <p>NYCFC v New York Red Bulls. The match-up that everyone wants, and the most probable one too, with only a surging DC United looking like serious challengers to the New York teams. Gauging how good NYC FC actually is can be very hard, but their road form has been impeccable in 2016, which is always a good tool for a play-off team to have. However, when the Red Bulls get their pressing game right, there is not a team in the league that can match them. We all know who holds the lead in this series, but look for NYCFC to fight to the final whistle in an attempt to overturn their immensely painful record in this matchup. <strong>GN</strong></p> <p>Red Bulls v NYC FC. The conference final MLS head office has been waiting for. New York\u2019s two teams are the strongest in the East right and so there\u2019s no reason to believe this match-up won\u2019t come to pass on November 22 and November 30. MLS always wanted a second NY franchise to capitalise on the city\u2019s simmering soccer culture. This is the dream fixture to help that happen. <strong>GR</strong></p> <p>Everyone will pick this match-up, but it\u2019s difficult to bet against a NYC FC-Red Bulls derby in the conference final: the pair from either side of the Hudson river have more going for them than anybody in the East. If Giovinco has a huge postseason Toronto could be in the mix, but it\u2019s hard to make a case for anyone else. Philly haven\u2019t won in two months, Montreal are erratic, and DC lack quality. <strong>TH</strong></p> <h2>The Western Conference final will be</h2> <p>Colorado Rapids v FC Dallas. Once again, I\u2019m pulling my predictable card, but the top two-seeded clubs in the west will also meet in the conference final. Even without Diaz, Dallas have just about enough to make it here and the Rapids have home-field advantage until they meet \u00d3scar Pareja\u2019s men. This one is a no-brainer. <strong>LME</strong></p> <p>FC Dallas v LA Galaxy. The Galaxy have blown hot and cold all year, and have been allowed to claim the No3 seed in the West more by default than by skill. Their path to the Conference final will have to go through Colorado on short rest \u2013 which is never easy \u2013 but they have the canniest of coaches in Bruce Arena who knows how to grind it out. I expect FC Dallas to gallop through to the Conference final, and then blow past LA\u2019s tired legs, but this would be a fascinating matchup of the new and the old in the West. <strong>GN</strong></p> <p>Colorado v LA Galaxy. Knockout soccer should suit the Colorado Rapids perfectly, losing the joint-fewest games in the regular season. The LA Galaxy, on the other hand, are harder to call. They will have to make it from the knockout round all the way to the conference final, but with this likely to be a swan song for both Steven Gerrard and Landon Donovan (again) momentum and all that comes with it could be a factor. <strong>GR</strong></p> <p>Dallas v Seattle. Dallas are the strongest team in the West and they should reach the final with relative ease. I can\u2019t see Sporting or RSL getting there, and I just have a feeling that Seattle could do something, particularly if Nicolas Lodeiro and Jordan Morris continue their good form. <strong>TH</strong></p> <h2>One player to make the difference</h2> <p>Giovinco. I haven\u2019t mentioned Toronto FC just because I think the team\u2019s play-off chances heavily rely on his genius and the state of his fitness. Based on his 90-minute performance this past Sunday, it seems that the Atomic Ant has finally shaken off his injury woes and is ready to help Toronto reach the MLS Cup Final for the first time in their history. The only issue for me is the workload, and whether the Italian star can withstand three matches in seven days. <strong>LME</strong><br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"822031dafb835db068c888c636bb88f6a802c953\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/822031dafb835db068c888c636bb88f6a802c953/0_0_3580_2593/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sebastian Giovinco should be fit to lead Toronto FC.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"724\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sebastian Giovinco should be fit to lead Toronto FC.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: John E. Sokolowski/USA Today Sports</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Nicol\u00e1s Lodeiro. He has been nothing short of phenomenal since he arrived in MLS, and will have to keep it up if Seattle are going to progress throughout the play-offs. He has vast tournament experience with Boca Juniors and Uruguay and will need to put the team on his back in the absence of Clint Dempsey. If his partnership with Jordan Morris starts to blossom in the knockout rounds, look for teams to man mark him in the later rounds in an attempt to neutralize him. Good luck. <strong>GN</strong></p> <p>Long considered the great white hope of homegrown American soccer Jordan Morris remains a raw and unpolished talent, but he has made quite the impression in his maiden MLS season. No rookie has scored as many game-winning goals in one year. He has become the Seattle Sounders\u2019 difference maker in Dempsey\u2019s absence. <strong>GR</strong></p> <p>Sacha Kljestan. An excellent all-round midfielder who\u2019s had a really good season with the Red Bulls. He could lead Jesse Marsch\u2019s team to the title. <strong>TH</strong></p> <h2>Your 2016 MLS Cup winners</h2> <p>Colorado Rapids. In Leicester-esque fashion, Colorado will write the comeback story of the year. In 2015, Pablo Mastroeni\u2019s men finished dead last in the West, with only nine wins to their name. His job was in jeopardy and the future seemed bleak. Fast forward to this year, and the 40-year-old Argentinian American completely changed the team\u2019s mentality and turned them into one of the best teams in the league. I just wish he grew his mustache back. <strong>LME</strong><br></p> <p>FC Dallas. The sentimental choice, but the correct one too, based on form throughout the season and the fact that this young team got a taste of the joy of winning a tournament with the US Open Cup. Mauro Diaz\u2019s injury will present problems, but Dallas has learned to play without him through the years. An organization with great chemistry and furious momentum, they will be hard to stop if they start getting into a groove. The allure of the treble will keep them motivated through the more brutal stretches, when teams will resort to cynical play to slow them down. Winning the treble would be a fantastic achievement, and one that this special team deserves. <strong>GN</strong></p> <p>Everything is in place for the New York Red Bulls to finally claim the MLS Cup that has evaded them for so, so long. Jesse Marsch\u2019s side have so far stayed clear of any season-derailing injuries and with Bradley Wright-Phillips and Sacha Kljestan sparkling brighter than most this year the Red Bulls have the individual talent and the tactical basis to prove themselves as genuine challengers this time around. <strong>GR</strong></p> <p>Red Bulls. They just look the best team, and I\u2019m backing them to lift a first MLS Cup in their history. I often think goal difference is a good indication of a team\u2019s strength, and NYRB\u2019s total of +17 was the best in the league. They\u2019re strong and experienced, have the league\u2019s best striker in Bradley Wright-Phillips, and I think Kljestan could make the difference. Dallas should make the final, but the Red Bulls will have too much. <strong>TH</strong></p>",
  "<p>The perceived crises at the two Manchester clubs should give the EFL Cup tie at Old Trafford on Wednesday considerable edge. Even so, the game is unlikely to match the drama, intensity and noise of the previous League Cup meetings between the sides. All four, from 1969 to 2010, have gone into Manchester derby folklore.</p> <p>The first, a semi-final played in December 1969, was a meeting of the holy trinities: Colin Bell, Francis Lee and Mike Summerbee for City, George Best, Bobby Charlton and Denis Law for United. Five of the six scored in the two-leg tie and the other, Best, was heavily involved throughout. Both teams were 18 months past their triumphant peak, when City won the league and United the European Cup, but delved into the muscle memory bank to produce a pair of end-to-end epics.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2010/jan/27/manchester-united-manchester-city-carling-cup\">Manchester United 3-1 Manchester City (4-3 on agg) | Carling Cup semi</a> </p> </aside>  <p>City won the first leg 2-1 at Maine Road, with Lee earning and scoring a late penalty. Even members of the clergy were captivated. \u201cOne esteemed member of the cloth, who usually does not express his feelings in such worldly fashion, observed that it was \u2018a helluva game\u2019,\u201d wrote Eric Todd in his Guardian report. \u201cNobody would argue with the revered gentleman\u2019s assessment.\u201d</p> <p>A few, all wearing red shirts, argued with the penalty decision. Best, who was also aggrieved at being booked, knocked the ball out of the referee Jack Taylor\u2019s hands after the final whistle. The gesture was either playful or petulant, depending on whose story you believe. Taylor included it in his report and Best was banned for four weeks. He was so affronted by the punishment that, when he returned against Northampton in the FA Cup, he scored six in an 8-2 win.</p> <p>Best was not banned until a couple of weeks after the second leg at Old Trafford. United\u2019s 2-1 lead meant it was 3-3 on aggregate when, with eight minutes to go, City were awarded an indirect free-kick just outside the area. Lee took a shot at goal anyway, possibly hoping for a deflection, and the goalkeeper Alex Stepney palmed it out for Summerbee to score the decisive goal. It was only when he later saw the highlights of the match on TV that Stepney realised it was an indirect free-kick, and he should have let Lee\u2019s shot go straight into the net. City beat West Bromwich Albion 2-1 in the final.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"70104b707739086b8ce474d11fb0a29caa532b75\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/70104b707739086b8ce474d11fb0a29caa532b75/0_0_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Manchester City\u2019s Mike Summerbee scores the winner on aggregate past Alex Stepney in the 1969 semi-final second leg at Old Trafford.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Manchester City\u2019s Mike Summerbee scores the winner on aggregate past Alex Stepney in the 1969 semi-final second leg at Old Trafford.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PA Archive</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The derbies around that time were dominated by City \u2013 particularly at Old Trafford, where they won six out of seven league matches between 1968 and 1974. The last of those was the famous match in which they symbolically \u2013 if not actually \u2013 relegated United, the Lawman beating up the wrong guys and all that. Almost six months later, City returned to Old Trafford in the League Cup as huge favourites. United were going well in the Second Division, which they would win comfortably, and Old Trafford bristled with the unique defiance that is evident when a superpower are underdogs on their own ground.</p> <p>Arthur Albiston, 17, made a famous debut at left-back and United won 1-0 through a disputed penalty from Gerry Daly, the underweight midfielder whose spot-kick record at United is better than those of Eric Cantona and Ruud van Nistelrooy. In The Red Army Years, Richard Kurt\u2019s majestic book about United in the 1970s, one United supporter says the noise compared with famous wins over Ajax in 1976 and Barcelona in 1984 \u201cas the greatest, most unbelievably exciting atmosphere I\u2019ve ever seen Old Trafford generate\u201d.</p> <p>City fans get just as misty-eyed about the rematch a year later, for more than one reason. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2010/jan/19/manchester-city-united-1975-league-cup\">They trounced Tommy Docherty\u2019s young side 4-0</a>, with Dennis Tueart scoring the first goal after 35 seconds and Asa Hartford at the centre of some coruscating football. This paper said it was their \u201cbest performance for years\u201d. Yet the match is most remembered for the injury that effectively ended the career of the elegant Bell, one of the best and most popular players City have ever had, when his studs got stuck in the turf as he was tackled by Martin Buchan.</p> <p>\u201cIt felt like my leg had been screwed into the ground,\u201d said Bell in his autobiography, Reluctant Hero. \u201cMy knee bent backwards, bursting blood vessels in the bottom of my thigh and in the top of my calf. All the ligaments in my knee were torn. Within seconds the knee was just a bag of blood.\u201d</p> <p>Buchan has been demonised by City fans ever since but most neutrals felt he did little wrong. \u201cI don\u2019t blame Martin Buchan for the injury,\u201d Bell said. \u201cThere were players in the game who set out to kick and injure you but I don\u2019t think Martin was that type.\u201d</p> <p>As in 1969-70, City went on to win the League Cup after beating United. It was their last trophy until the Abu Dhabi United Group takeover in 2008. A year later, after a deranged 4-3 win at Old Trafford, a triumphant Sir Alex Ferguson said City were \u201cnoisy neighbours\u201d. United wanted to keep them quiet for as long as possible, and they just about did so in an immense semi-final later that season. City won the home leg 2-1, with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2010/jan/19/carling-cup-manchester-city-manchester-united\">Carlos Tevez scoring two goals</a> against his old club and introducing a new word to the football lexicon: after a touchline dispute with the substitute Gary Neville, he called Neville a \u201csocksucker\u201d in a radio interview.</p> <p>Tevez scored again at Old Trafford with a brilliant flick, and the score was 3-3 on aggregate when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2010/jan/27/manchester-united-manchester-city-carling-cup\">Wayne Rooney headed the winner</a> in the second minute of stoppage time. Rooney was in the form of his life, at the start of a spell of 18 goals in 13 games before injury at Bayern Munich set his career on a different path. His goal was one of three injury-time winners for United against City that season, a spectacular way to delay the inevitable change in Manchester\u2019s balance of power.</p> <p>City beat United a year later in the FA Cup semi-final, en route to their first trophy since 1976. That was one of the most significant matches in Manchester football history; but when it comes to knockout competitions, it is the League Cup that has provided most of the classics.</p>",
  "<p>Isn\u2019t it the law in Bake Off that only Mel and Sue do double entendres? If so, Candice Brown didn\u2019t get the memo. \u201cDo you need a hand?\u2019 asked Andrew in biscuit week. \u201cYeah, can you come and grab my jugs please?\u201d she replied, pouting at the blushing engineer as he retreated in giggles.</p> <p>At first, thanks to such saucy moments, I had Candice pegged simply as a cheeky minx of a baker with intriguing lips. Which is how I like my women, and indeed men. These qualities would have been enough to cheer up Wednesday evenings. But there proved much, much more to the secondary school teacher who lives in Bedfordshire with boyfriend Liam and pug Dennis (or maybe it\u2019s the other way round).</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/oct/26/great-british-bake-off-candice-brown-jane-beedle-andrew-smyth-bbc-finale-channel-4\">Great British Bake Off stars to cook up a storm in tense BBC finale</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In the same week she made Andrew blush, she did something that, baking-wise, floated my fougasse. She produced a gingerbread replica of her parents\u2019 old north London pub for her showstopper, piping the name, King Billy IV, in icing. In a show in which mimsy contestants bake oversized breads evoking Norse legends or witter smugly about using eggs from their own plot, how refreshing that Candice created England\u2019s answer to Proust\u2019s madeleine \u2013 an edible boozer evoking her youthful memories of pulling pints.</p> <p>But it was a detail in the gingerbread pub that really got me. The carpet. It was made from ginger, and slightly sticky. Is there anything more British than a pub carpet, soaked with who knows what kinds of toxic material, holding for all eternity the odour of fags and disappointment? No, there isn\u2019t. Then what genius it was for Candice to alchemically transmute this abject icon of British culture into something beautiful and filled with bittersweet childhood memories. </p> <p>Of course, even though she\u2019s the bookies\u2019 favourite to win, some people don\u2019t like Candice. They don\u2019t like that she changes the shade of her lipstick for each show. They don\u2019t like that she sometimes bakes in heels.

Fortunately, Candice has a skin thicker than Henry VIII\u2019s game pies: rather than getting hurt by the hate, she superbly retweeted this toxic blah. <br></p> <p>And when someone else tweeted unpleasant stuff about her lips (She pouts!

Allow me to retort. First, Nadiya\u2019s peacock was made out of Rice Krispies, marshmallows and a pinch of desperation and, what\u2019s more, unacceptably, contained no cake, while Candice\u2019s peacock was a shimmering work of art fashioned from Tudor marzipan and \u2013 finally! \u2013 cake. And second, why was Twitter bleating about Candice\u2019s bird when it should have directed its attention to the historically ludicrous Mexican fillings in the otherwise delightful Benjamina\u2019s purportedly 16th-century Tudor pie? </p> <p>I don\u2019t want to go on about this, but Candice\u2019s peacock tail demonstrated the marvellous truth about her approach to Bake Off: she always fulfils the brief and then keeps going. Her peacock had a marzipan tail made of yellow lemon flavoured feathers and green feathers that tasted of mint. Plus inside there was a surprise of fresh blueberries. \u201cYou\u2019ve ticked all the boxes and then some,\u201d said Paul Hollywood.

She made two kinds of fondant fancy for the showstopper, one involving chocolate praline, the other a cherry Bakewell. Neither was as showy as the pub or the peacock, but rather something the TV audience couldn\u2019t appreciate \u2013 they were delicious. \u201cYou\u2019ve made,\u201d said Mary Berry, between mouthfuls, \u201ctwo cracking fondant fancies.\u201d Personally I could die happy if I knew that was going to be my epitaph. But such praise wouldn\u2019t do justice to Candice\u2019s talents. Only the Bake Off crown can do that. <br></p>",

Our typical user is someone in their 70s, living alone in rented accommodation on low income, with a long-term health condition and English as a second language. The main reason for joining us is acute loneliness and the need to make new friends.

  "<p>A winter coat, a pair of jeans, a shirt for work, boots and a pair of socks \u2013 that\u2019s the clothes shopping done for at least the next 30 years, maybe even for life.</p> <p>Buying clothes that last a lifetime is a concept that is fast gaining popularity. As brands launch \u201clifetime guarantees\u201d, there are now shirts on sale that will apparently last until 2046, and ever-lasting pairs of pants.</p> <p>Buy any of these garments and if a zip sticks or a waist band snaps, the company will repair or replace the item for free, even if you have owned it for years \u2013 though some of the brands claim their goods are so durable that you probably won\u2019t need to.</p> <p>According to the <a href=\"http://www.wrap.org.uk/sites/files/wrap/VoC%20FINAL%20online%202012%2007%2011.pdf\">Valuing our Clothes report by Wrap</a>, the waste reduction charity, extending the average life of items by<strong> </strong>three months would lead to a 5%10% reduction in each of the UK\u2019s carbon, water and waste footprints that can be attributed to clothing. </p> <p>So these new products represent a tick for anyone wanting sustainable fashion. However, the concept is also likely to appeal to anyone who is sick of spending money on knitwear that bobbles or shoes that fall apart. And that will be many of you, says Tara Button, founder of <a href=\"http://www.buymeonce.com/\">Buy me Once</a>, a website which promotes durable products. \u201cConsumers are understandably frustrated. Manufacturing methods are being downgraded while prices are staying high and many items simply don\u2019t last anymore,\u201d she says. </p> <h2>Feet first</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"9fb11de4b5e5317b54e0e3d929cead8965f29a14\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9fb11de4b5e5317b54e0e3d929cead8965f29a14/0_0_480_400/480.jpg\" alt=\"Dr. Martens for Life Collection\" width=\"480\" height=\"400\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A boot from the Dr Martens For Life collection</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Button\u2019s team is currently researching the quality of shoes and finding that many popular brands fall apart very quickly. She points to Dr Marten\u2019s as a good example of better practice. It offers a <a href=\"http://drmartensforlife.com/\">warranty for life on its Dr Marten\u2019s For Life</a> range \u2013 as long as your shoes or boots haven\u2019t been broken on purpose (Dr Martens says it will be able to tell) it will repair them, and if it can\u2019t you will get a replacement pair. To activate the guarantee you must register your footwear within 60 days of purchase.<br></p> <p>\u201cThe price as well as the warranty compares well to other boots, which can easily cost as much and not offer a guarantee,\u201d says Button. The range includes boots priced at \u00a3165 and shoes at \u00a3145 \u2013 not cheap, but less than twice the price of many of the firm\u2019s standard range.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"177c5ba4d957734d1924167ee71c765555fb2a30\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/177c5ba4d957734d1924167ee71c765555fb2a30/0_0_500_500/500.jpg\" alt=\"Darn Tough women\u2019s trekking sock promoted on the Buy for Life website.\" width=\"500\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Darn Tough women\u2019s trekking sock</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR image</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Similarly, with Darn Tough you pay more than for a standard pair of socks, but you get <a href=\"https://darntough.com/about-us/our-guarantee\">a guarantee for life</a>. If you manage to wear out a pair you can send them back (they\u2019re made in the US but you only need post them to an address in the UK) and get them replaced.

It trains in-store staff to carry out small repairs and pops up at festivals to run repair clinics.</p> <h2>The rest of your outfit</h2> <p>Swedish brand Nudie Jeans, meanwhile, has two dedicated repair shops in London where you can get your denims mended for free until they wear out. <a href=\"https://www.nudiejeans.com/page/this-is-nudie-jeans\">If you are not nearby, you can get hold of a repair kit</a>.

Dr Rebecca Collins, lecturer in human geography at Chester University, who researches consumption, says: \u201cI\u2019ve come to the conclusion that the quest for novel really drives consumers. If we want longer-lasting fashion we need an element of novelty within the garment. It has to be easily changeable and capable of being worn in different ways.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Alternatives</strong></h2> <p><strong>Buy well </strong>A price tag used to be a sign of quality, but that\u2019s no longer the case. However, there are some ways to check for the quality of the materials. For example, are the buttons tightly sewn on and do the button holes have tight stitching? When you gently pull the seams of a garment you can see if it\u2019s been closely sewn (lots of stitches are a sign that it\u2019s well made) or if there are gaps in the stitching (cheaply made). And always check the washing care instructions on the label. Natural fibres such as cotton and silk are likely to stand up better to repeat washes, as long as you follow the care advice.</p> <p><strong>Fix them </strong>There are sewing workshops and repair cafes (where skilled people will help you fix items) in many places, from <a href=\"http://www.stitchedup.coop/186-2/\">Manchester\u2019s Stitched Up </a>to <a href=\"https://repaircafe.org/en/locations/repair-cafe-bristol/\">Bristol\u2019s Repair Caf\u00e9</a>, and there tons of videos online which can help you carry out your own alterations and re-shaping.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--immersive\" data-media-id=\"313380aa0c854a398339960de7d27e24bb44b3c5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/313380aa0c854a398339960de7d27e24bb44b3c5/6_0_1509_1509/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Stitched Up in Chorlton, Manchester.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Stitched Up in Chorlton, Manchester.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Stitched up</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Borrowing clothes </strong>Some clothes are only ever worn occasionally. How many times do you wear a cocktail dress, for example? Or a morning suit for a wedding? So it may not be cost-effective to ever own these items. There are plenty of dress exchange and suit hire options on the high streets, while online sites such as <a href=\"https://chic-by-choice.com/en\">Chic-by-choice</a> and <a href=\"http://www.girlmeetsdress.com/hire\">Girlmeetsdress</a> offer women\u2019s items for hire, and men\u2019s suits can be found at places like <a href=\"https://www.slaters.co.uk/\">Slaters</a>.</p> <p>On Instagram, the hashtag #ShareWear allows you to search for shareable items. If you\u2019re first to post a comment on an item <a href=\"http://sharewear.se/borrow\">you can wear the clothes for a week</a> before passing them on to the next person. It\u2019s an initiative by VisitSweden and the Swedish Institute, a Swedish tourism agency. There are occasionally <a href=\"http://sharewear.se/howto\">items by Swedish designers</a> on the hashtag, which you wear for free for a week.</p> <p> Another way to extend your wardrobe is to borrow clothes from a Library of Things. There\u2019s one in <a href=\"http://www.libraryofthings.co.uk/\">London</a>, one in <a href=\"https://sharefrome.org/\">Frome</a>, and another is being started in Cardiff.

To use it you\u2019ll need a PlayStation 4 (\u00a3299) and a PS Eye Camera (\u00a344.99), which \u2013 while not exactly cheap \u2013 is less exorbitant than buying a PC-based set-up. The technology itself uses a camera at the front of the room to track head movements, presenting its alternative view of the world via a very small screen mounted in front of each eye. Despite PSVR\u2019s slightly fuzzier visuals, the feeling of being somewhere you\u2019re not is extraordinarily convincing, if sometimes disorientating.</p> <p>It\u2019s also been a challenge for games designers, who have had to find new ways of guiding players around spaces that don\u2019t literally exist. In Ocean Descent, one of the mini-games included in <strong>PlayStation VR Worlds</strong>, you don\u2019t even have a controller: your sole movement in the game is to look around and experience your slow winching into the ocean depths in a thankfully sturdy shark cage. Initially a relaxing experience, watching manta rays, turtles and a flotilla of glowing jellyfish drift by, you of course eventually bump into a shark, your feeling of exposure enhanced by the fact that you\u2019re stuck in a place with nothing to do but anticipate your future as a chew toy. It\u2019s a scary concept in spite of the not-particularly-terrifying CGI shark; even with no control, you feel part of the action to a vastly greater degree than in a conventional first-person game.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e43016d6f26f25797583e424cd199ba0306e4c88\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e43016d6f26f25797583e424cd199ba0306e4c88/122_97_1634_981/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Batman: Arkham VR.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Batman: Arkham VR.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>That immersion is a sense that <strong>Arkham VR</strong> (PSVR) exploits to excellent effect to make you feel like Batman.

One glance in an in-game mirror shows the folly of attempting to draw in arms and legs, your character\u2019s gangly, inhumanly-elongated form proving to be the stuff of nightmares. As you make your way through its mellow 22nd-century adventure you\u2019ll also experience frequent moments of intense clumsiness brought on by the vagaries of the PlayStation Eye camera\u2019s motion-sensing. The plot excuses your maladroit attempts to move or pick things up by casting your character as a practising alcoholic, his continual fumbling and walking into things supposedly the result of booze rather than the technology not quite working.

  "<p>British banker Rurik Jutting had become a chronic user of cocaine and alcohol in the weeks leading up to his alleged murder of two young Indonesian women, Hong Kong\u2019s high court has heard.</p> <p>On Wednesday, day three of Jutting\u2019s trial for the 2014 murders of 23-year-old Sumarti Ningsih and 26-year-old Seneng Mujiasih, jurors were told how the Cambridge-educated defendant became dependent on a daily cocktail of cocaine, alcohol and energy drinks.</p> <p>Toxicologist Lau Fei-lung, who was called as an expert witness by the prosecution, <a href=\"http://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/component/k2/1292947-20161026.htm\">told the court</a> that at the time of the deaths, in the autumn of 2014, the 31-year-old had been \u201cdeeply addicted\u201d to cocaine, consuming the equivalent of three uncut grams of the drug each day.</p> <p>Jutting had also been consuming up to four bottles of wine a day as well as large quantities of the energy drink Red Bull, Lau said.</p> <p>However, Lau told the court that despite his heavy intake of drugs and alcohol \u2013 amounts he said would put most people in a coma \u2013 Jutting was not intoxicated and remained in largely control of his actions at the time of the killings. </p> <p>The claims were made one day after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/25/british-banker-rurik-jutting-describes-torture-and-killing-in-video-shown-to-jury\">jurors were shown graphic video footage</a>, filmed by Jutting on his smartphone, in which he admitted to raping, torturing and killing Sumarti Ningsih after luring her to his luxury apartment on Hong Kong island on 25 October 2014. </p> <p>\u201cObviously I\u2019m clearly loopy\u2026 that\u2019s paranoia from cocaine,\u201d the semi-clothed banker can be heard saying in one of more than 40 videos that was shown to the court on Tuesday. In another excerpt viewed by the jury, Jutting says: \u201cMy destiny is to push the boundaries of complete and utter inhumanity.\u201d</p> <p>As well being accused of murdering Ningsih on the night of 27 October, Jutting, a trader for Bank of America Merrill Lynch, is also alleged to have murdered Seneng Mujiasih after convincing her to return to the same apartment on 31 October. </p> <p>Shortly after cutting Mujiasih\u2019s throat, Jutting is alleged to have called police to his 31st-floor home, where he was arrested in the early hours of 1 November. </p> <p>On Wednesday afternoon, the court was shown excerpts from a police interview with Jutting, conducted one day after his arrest, in which he admitted to both killings. </p> <p>\u201cYes, I did kill her. I cut her throat,\u201d Jutting told police according to a reporter from Channel News Asia who was at the hearing. \u201cI can honestly say these are the only two individuals who have been killed by me,\u201d Jutting reportedly added.</p> <p>The gruesome killings have shocked Hong Kong, where murders are rare, and cast a spotlight on the hardships often suffered by more than 300,000 domestic helpers who migrate to Hong Kong from places such as Indonesia and the Philippines in search of work. <br></p> <p>Friends have said that Mujiasih and Ningsih, who had a five-year-old son, both came to Hong Kong hoping to improve their lives and fell into part-time prostitution in the neighbourhood near Jutting\u2019s home as a way of helping support their families. <br></p> <p>On Monday, day one of his trial, Jutting pleaded guilty to the women\u2019s manslaughter but not guilty to murder on the grounds of diminished responsibility. The trial continues.</p>",
  "<p>A Hong Kong-born former Northern Ireland assembly member has said the Brexit vote will deter other ethnic minority people from entering politics as racism and xenophobia intensifies.</p> <p>Anna Lo, who retired from the assembly partly due to racial abuse she says she has received, also predicted that anti-foreigner violence and intimidation would increase in Northern Ireland as the UK\u2019s withdrawal from the EU approached.</p> <p>Speaking before the launch of her memoir, The Place I Call Home, the president of the cross-community Alliance party said the EU referendum result had built \u201cdangerous expectations\u201d among pro-Brexit voters that immigrants would leave Northern Ireland and other parts of the UK.</p> <p>\u201cShortly after the referendum the Northern Ireland Council for Ethnic Minorities organised a conference about Brexit\u2019s impact on this place. Even only a few weeks after the vote I heard dozens of immigrants stating that they were starting to hear their fellow workmates asking them: \u2018Well then, when are you all going home?\u2019 Brexit has raised dangerous expectations as well as putting out lies about immigrants taking up benefits, houses, jobs,\u201d Lo said.</p> <p>\u201cI have been the victim of racist abuse and threats in the recent past but I fear more than ever for immigrant communities living in Northern Ireland following the Brexit vote. It has stirred up so much negativity towards people from ethnic minorities. I am worried like never before about racism and anti-immigrant feeling after Brexit.\u201d</p> <p>Lo said she doubted anyone from her ethnic background would be prepared to enter British or Northern Irish politics in the post-Brexit era. \u201cIt was hard enough being in the devolved assembly before the referendum, but given the atmosphere since the Brexit vote I would be very doubtful that anyone from a background like mine would stand up and enter politics now. It is going to get even harder to persuade people from ethnic minorities to come forward and stand for election, but especially in Northern Ireland.\u201d</p> <p>In her book, Lo says she was on the receiving end of racist abuse and intimidation because she was the public face of the immigrant community in Northern Ireland.</p> <p>She writes: \u201cOne Thursday, on my way from Stormont to my constituency office after a committee meeting, I stopped in Connswater shopping centre to get a picture taken for a new passport. On my way out of the centre to the front car park, I heard people shouting my name. As they did not sound particularly friendly, I quickened my pace and got to where my car was parked.</p> <p>\u201cThen a car passed me. A young woman was practically hanging out of the back passenger window, screaming abuse at me. I was extremely glad that they did not catch up with me and that there was a barrier between the road where the vehicle was travelling and my car. I was quite sure that, if they had got closer to me, there would have been an ugly scene.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/jun/03/racism-northern-ireland-muslims-peter-robinson-resign\">Tackling racism in Northern Ireland must start with the first minister | Anna Lo</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Lo says she was appalled by alleged anti-Islam remarks made by the former first minister Peter Robinson two years ago.

In her speech, she said British companies needed the \u201cmaximum freedom to trade and operate in the single market\u201d but not at the expense of \u201cgiving up control of immigration again\u201d or accepting the jurisdiction of judges in Luxembourg.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/26/why-theresa-mays-secret-speech-really-does-matter\">Why Theresa May's secret speech really does matter</a> </p> </aside>  <p>At Goldman Sachs, May also said she was convinced Britain\u2019s security was best served by remaining in Europe because of tools such as the European arrest warrant and information-sharing between the police and intelligence agencies.</p> <p>\u201cThere are definitely things we can do as members of the <a href=\"https://viewer.gutools.co.uk/world/eu\">European Union</a> that I think keep us more safe,\u201d she said.</p> <p>The disclosures could prove embarrassing for the prime minister, who faced <a href=\"https://viewer.gutools.co.uk/politics/2016/sep/25/brexit-books-david-cameron-theresa-may-party-split\">criticism for lying low during the referendum campaign</a> and offering only lukewarm support for the remain side.</p> <p>In April, May gave a speech in which she set out some of the reasons for staying in the EU, <a href=\"http://www.conservativehome.com/parliament/2016/04/theresa-mays-speech-on-brexit-full-text.html\">warning that it could have an impact on the development of the single market for the rest of the EU</a> if the UK left. But her comments at the Goldman Sachs event a month later go further in warning about the dangers to the British economy from businesses relocating to continental Europe.</p> <p>During the referendum campaign, May infuriated senior Conservative colleagues on the remain side by largely staying out of the day-to-day arguments in favour of staying in the EU. One of her major pro-remain interventions was overshadowed by an announcement that she would like to take the <a href=\"https://viewer.gutools.co.uk/politics/2016/apr/25/uk-must-leave-european-convention-on-human-rights-theresa-may-eu-referendum\">UK out of the European convention on human rights</a>, which she quickly ditched when running for the party leadership.</p> <p>Her refusal to participate much in the campaign led Craig Oliver, David Cameron\u2019s former chief of communications, to wonder if she was secretly an \u201cenemy agent\u201d for the other side. However, others have suggested she believed in the arguments for staying in but was keeping her powder dry in case of a pro-Brexit vote.</p> <p>Goldman Sachs confirmed May had spoken to staff but was not paid. She accepted an invitation as part of the bank\u2019s Talks@GS programme, in which high achievers from all walks of life are given a chance to reflect on their experiences and answer questions.</p> <p>Chuka Umunna, the Labour MP and former shadow business secretary, said May was \u201cright then \u2013 and it underlines why single market membership should be her ambition now\u201d.<br></p> <p>A No 10 spokesman said: \u201cBritain made a clear choice to vote to leave the EU and this government is determined to make a success of the fresh opportunities it presents.</p> <p>\u201cDavid Davis made very clear in the House of Commons last week the importance the government places on financial services across the UK in the negotiation to come, as has the chancellor in recent weeks.</p> <p>\u201cWe want a smooth and orderly exit from the European Union, which would be in the interests of both Britain and the EU.\u201d</p>",

  "<p>To say that Birmingham city council leader John Clancy is bullish about Brexit would be an understatement. Looking back on June\u2019s referendum, Clancy \u2013 who voted Remain and whose city <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-36616108\" title=\"\">voted Leave by a whisker of less than 1%</a> \u2013 claims to feel no regrets at all.</p> <p>When I suggest grief as one natural-enough response to this severing of ties, he laughs. \u201cHa ha, it\u2019s happened \u2013 you\u2019ve just got to deal with it. Look, it was one of the great political moments of all our lives but I don\u2019t think grief is the word. I think opportunity is, especially for big cities like Birmingham. We have to position ourselves as a world city, not just a European city.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>One of the things socialists should do is to subvert capital and make sure it works</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Clancy, 54, who took over the crisis-hit council last December when <a href=\"http://www.birminghampost.co.uk/news/regional-affairs/john-clancy-wins-race-lead-10491776\" title=\"\">he won a leadership election by one vote</a>, was in China last month to negotiate \u00a32bn worth of investment in housing from Hong Kong-listed property giant <a href=\"http://www.countrygarden.com.cn/enn/index.aspx\" title=\"\">Country Garden</a>. On the long list of problems facing the city, including its failed children\u2019s services, deeply ingrained poverty, large numbers of unskilled workers and further massive cuts, he puts housing at the top. As the council owns 60% of development sites, he sees himself not as a broker but as a maker of deals: \u201cOne of the reasons I went to China was to see if there was shovel-ready capital ready to come to this city. Country Garden is a company with social objectives and I think it\u2019s one of the things socialists should do \u2013 subvert capital and make sure it works.\u201d</p> <p>This year he was in Chicago as the guest of mayor Rahm Emanuel, and could not be more on board with fashionable ideas about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities\" title=\"\">cities as hubs of innovation, diversity and progress</a>. Someone there asked why Birmingham didn\u2019t have its own foreign office. He thinks it should, and plans to work on this with the <a href=\"http://www.centreforcities.org/west-midlands-3/\" title=\"\">West Midlands metro mayor</a> , <a href=\"http://www.birminghammail.co.uk/news/midlands-news/labours-west-midlands-mayor-candidate-11724462\" title=\"\">likely to be Labour\u2019s Sion Simon, </a>after next May\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/public-leaders-network/2016/jun/20/britain-mayors-real-power-sadiq-khan\" title=\"\">mayoral election</a>.</p> <p>I can\u2019t hide my incredulity at this, not least because the UK is the most centralised country in Europe, and the idea of the Birmingham, Manchester or London mayors appointing foreign secretaries hadn\u2019t crossed my mind. But Clancy seems not only to be serious but also to think that Brexit may even help.</p> <p>\u201cI think we\u2019ve [Birmingham] got 19 people in Brussels now,\u201d he says. \u201cObviously post-Brexit one has to reface the world, but I think if you\u2019re engaging in a proactive economic policy in relation to building inclusive growth in your city, that involves engaging with world capital. That\u2019s how diplomacy started in the very earliest days. We believe that city regions, city states indeed, are going to be far more powerful post-Brexit in terms of developing international trade.\u201d</p> <p>Clancy grew up in Stockport, the son of a nursery school headteacher and an electrician, and went from a Catholic grammar school to Keele University, where he studied English and law. He worked as a teacher and a solicitor, joined the Labour party when his daughter was born in 1989, and moved to Birmingham a year later to be near his wife\u2019s family.</p> <p>In 1997 he chaired Gisela Stuart\u2019s campaign when she won Edgbaston from the Conservatives, and he challenged Sir Albert Bore four times as Labour group leader before finally being elected last year. Bore stood down following a highly critical <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/kerslake-report-birmingham-council-must-radically-improve\" title=\"\">report by Sir Bob Kerslake</a>, commissioned in the aftermath of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/may/24/birmingham-childrens-services-run-trust-following-failures\" title=\"\">children\u2019s services failures </a>and the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2014/jul/17/birmingham-schools-inquiry-hardline-sunni-islam-trojan-horse\" title=\"\">\u201cTrojan horse\u201d scandal,</a> when an investigation criticised Muslim-majority schools for promoting \u201csegregationist attitudes\u201d and a politicised version of Islam. The report called for a complete overhaul of the council, or \u201cprogramme of culture change\u201d, and, among other reforms, its children\u2019s services department is in the process of being spun off into a voluntary trust.</p> <p>A supporter of electoral reform on the left of his party, Clancy wrote a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/economics-blog/2014/may/27/local-authority-pension-fund-reforms-john-clancy-secret-wealth-garden\" title=\"\">book </a>arguing that local authority pension funds should be pooled and forced to buy local investment bonds. Whether he voted for Jeremy Corbyn as Labour leader, he won\u2019t say: \u201cI think at the moment it\u2019s probably best to \u2026\u201d He stops and restarts. \u201cThat\u2019s something that happened over the summer\u2026 It needn\u2019t have happened, it shouldn\u2019t have happened and I think most people who were involved in the challenge now accept it was a grave error of judgment.\u201d Now he wants Corbyn and shadow chancellor John McDonnell to start paying attention to Labour\u2019s strength in local government, calling London plus the 10 Labour councils of the <a href=\"http://corecities.com/\" title=\"\">Core Cities group</a> the party\u2019s \u201cfirst 11\u201d. While the \u201cnorthern powerhouse\u201d has had a near monopoly on devolution-related news, and Manchester mayoral hopeful <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/aug/09/andy-burnham-not-afraid-of-challenging-labour-policy\" title=\"\">Andy Burnham has by far the highest profile of Labour\u2019s mayoral candidates</a>, Clancy thinks the change of Conservative leader and the sacking of George Osborne were good news for the \u201cMidlands engine\u201d. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/13/theresa-may-must-explain-her-vision\" title=\"\">Theresa May\u2019s admiration for Joseph Chamberlain, mayor of Birmingham in the 1870s</a>, shared by her adviser Nick Timothy, was noted in the first days of her premiership. Communities secretary Sajid Javid\u2019s constituency is a mile and a half from Clancy\u2019s ward, business secretary Greg Clark is another supporter, and Clancy knows he will need such allies if he is to protect the region\u2019s automotive industry from potentially ruinous tariffs. About the trio of Fox, Johnson and Davis leading the Brexit negotiations, he has less to say, except (dropping his voice) that they make \u201can interesting band\u201d.</p> <p>He claims he didn\u2019t consider running for mayor of the West Midlands, \u201cgenuinely not for a moment\u201d. Since Labour\u2019s metro mayor candidates are all either current or former MPs, one wonders if he calculated that, as a local politician, he wouldn\u2019t win. But Clancy insists he wants to run Birmingham, the biggest local authority in Europe. The metro mayor will have a strategic role overseeing regeneration across the region. In budget terms, Clancy points out that his is the bigger job: Birmingham council\u2019s budget (including schools and social care across an area covering 10 parliamentary constituencies and 1.1 million people) is \u00a33.5bn, whereas the metro mayor\u2019s is \u00a336.5m. As Birmingham\u2019s leader, he will, in any case, be a big player on the mayor\u2019s team.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>He calls London plus the 10 Labour councils of the Core Cities group the Labour party\u2019s 'first 11'</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Aside from an acute shortage of homes, the pain inflicted by cuts, and the disconnection from politics among working-class voters that Clancy believes was one of lessons of the EU vote, he says the council\u2019s biggest problem is that it \u201cthought it was the city\u201d. He suggests Chamberlain was a metro mayor before his time in understanding the city as a public-private partnership. He calls the West Midlands authority\u2019s plan to invest in mental health \u201cChamberlainesque\u201d, and says the new combined authorities are filling gaps left by the <a href=\"http://nationalarchives.gov.uk/webarchive/regional-development-agencies.htm\" title=\"\">regional development agencies</a> abolished by the Coalition in 2010.</p> <p>Clancy is relishing headlines about people relocating to his city, along with the buzz of HS2, and says Birmingham is ahead of anywhere else in the way it runs its schools. He even has a positive spin on the \u201cTrojan horse\u201d debacle, and says the end-result was a sharpening of \u201cBirmingham values\u201d, but the council itself remains on shaky ground. Further recommendations from the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/birmingham-improvement-panel-named\" title=\"\">panel appointed in 2015 by the then communities secretary, Eric Pickles</a>, to keep an eye on it, and ensure that Kerslake\u2019s recommendations are followed through, are expected shortly.</p> <p>Would he try to resurrect the idea of a mayor of the city of Birmingham?</p> <p>\u201cJoe Chamberlain wasn\u2019t a directly elected mayor: he was elected by city councillors. I don\u2019t think it particularly held him back, not that I\u2019m suggesting I\u2019m necessarily anywhere near that kind of level,\u201d he laughs.As for Clancy\u2019s global vision, he says: \u201cGlobal growth, capital and enterprise were offered to ordinary folk as a way to achieve their dreams, and turned out to be quite the opposite. You ended up with hollowed-out economies in big cities around the world. So the response has to be from big cities, in terms of industrial strategy, and in the UK that has to start from places like Birmingham.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Curriculum vitae</strong></h2> <p><br><strong>Age</strong> 54</p> <p><strong>Lives</strong> Birmingham</p> <p><strong>Family</strong> Married, one daughter</p> <p><strong>Education</strong> St Bede\u2019s Roman Catholic College, Manchester; Keele University, English and law joint honours degree; Manchester Law School.</p> <p><strong>Career</strong> December 2015-present: leader, Birmingham city council; 1985-2015 teacher, various comprehensive schools</p> <p><strong>Public life</strong> February 2002-present: elected Birmingham council member; served on several key committees, including education scrutiny, regeneration scrutiny, public protection and planning.</p> <p><strong>Books</strong> Co-author (with with industry professor David Bailey), Blogs from the Blackstuff (2010); The Secret Wealth Garden: Re-wiring Local Government Pension Funds back into Regional Economies (2014); regular business columnist for the Birmingham Post.</p> <p><strong>Interests</strong> Stockport County FC and Aston Villa FC supporter, playing darts and campaigned to keep the pastime alive in Birmingham pubs</p>",

But here\u2019s what we know so far. </p> <h2><strong>When did the accident occur?</strong></h2> <p>At 2.20pm on Tuesday park operators were alerted to an incident on the Thunder River Rapids ride. It\u2019s one of Dreamworld\u2019s biggest attractions, where tourists are sent on a circular vessel down a series of rapids while being pushed along by a current. Towards the end of the ride, a fatal accident occurred that led to the death of four adults. </p> <p>Queensland police and emergency services said two of the adults were \u201cejected\u201d from the ride and another two were caught within it. Their injuries were severe. Emergency services described their injuries as \u201cinconsistent with living\u201d.</p> <p>Two children who were also on the raft survived.

The coroner\u2019s office has sweeping powers to gather information and compel witnesses to give evidence. </p> <h2><strong>How does the Thunder River Rapids ride work?</strong></h2> <p>The ride is one of the most popular attractions at the theme park. It carries groups of passengers in a raft along a canal, buoyed by fast-moving water. Metal tubes guide the raft and there\u2019s a lot of movement. </p> <p>At the end of the ride a conveyor belt lifts the raft on to a small incline and places it back near the beginning of the ride. It is understood this is where the incident occurred.</p> <p>Guardian Australia understands there is an alarm system for the rapids ride that is tested each morning. When an alarm goes off engineers must check to see if there are any safety concerns.</p> <h2><strong>Who\u2019s responsible for overseeing the safety of rides?</strong></h2> <p>Dreamworld and the company that owns the theme park, Ardent Leisure Limited, bear a substantial responsibility for what happens at the park. They\u2019re required to maintain the rides and ensure they are functioning appropriately. </p> <p>Queensland\u2019s workplace health and safety regulator also plays a role in overseeing safety. It has inspected and investigated rides in the past, but it is unclear how regularly this happens. </p> <p>The regulator has released a series of inspection forms and complaints that have been raised with it over the past four years. These reports were released in response to a freedom of information request from the Australian Workers Union. The union, which represents workers at the theme park, has been critical of Dreamworld\u2019s management and maintenance. It said there have been a number of concerns raised with them over the past 18 months.</p> <h2><strong>Has anything like this ever happened before?</strong></h2> <p>In 1999 a woman died at the Six Flags theme park in Texas on a similar type of rapids ride. In that case a raft had deflated during the ride which caused it to flip over. Ten others were injured, and <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20040715112129/http://www.texnews.com/1998/2002/texas/six0223.html\">the dead woman\u2019s family</a> received a $4m settlement from the theme park operator.</p>",
  "<p>Young offenders up to the age of 25 should be kept out of adult prisons because of \u201cirrefutable evidence\u201d that the typical adult male brain is not fully formed until at least the mid-20s, MPs have said.</p> <p>The House of Commons justice select committee says young adults, who make up 10% of the adult prison population but account for 30-40% of police time, should be treated differently by the criminal justice system and be held in young offender institutions with 18- to 20-year-olds.</p> <p>The MPs say that the most recent evidence shows that young people are reaching adult maturity five to seven years later than they did a few decades ago, which is affecting the age at which most typically grow out of crime.</p> <p>The justice select committee report on young adult offenders cites behaviourial neuro-scientific evidence that this is reflected in the late development of those parts of their brain that determine how individuals weigh long-term gains against short-term reward efforts.</p> <p>\u201cAs the brain is a plastic organ it can heal to an extent up to the age of 25 if taken out of \u2018aversive circumstances\u2019 which can cause brain changes, for example, separation from family and friends and exposure to punitive conditions,\u201d the MPs argue.</p> <p>\u201cWhile the brain is continuing to develop there is a risk that problems will be compounded by involvement in the criminal justice system itself and that opportunities will be missed to repair the developmental harm caused by brain injury or other forms of trauma.\u201d </p> <p> The committee\u2019s inquiry found those still offending into adulthood were more likely to have learning difficulties or communication disorders, or to have suffered head injuries and said flawed interventions by the prison and probation services did not recognise young adults\u2019 needs and prevented them getting out of a cycle of crime. Young adults have the highest reconviction rates with 75% reconvicted within two years of release.</p> <p> The report says that rates of learning disability, communication impairment and autistic spectrum disorder are 10 times higher among young offenders than among young people in the general population, and there is a high level of acquired brain injury \u2013 which, according to estimates by the Centre for Mental Health, can increase the likelihood of crime by 50%.</p> <p> \u201cThese factors impact on criminal behaviour and have implications for the appropriate treatment of young adults by the criminal justice system as they are more challenging to manage, harder to engage, and tend to have poorer outcomes.\u201d</p> <p> Much of this recent research stems from a substantial research programme by the Transition to Adulthood Alliance, a coalition of 12 criminal justice, health and youth organisations.</p> <p>The chair of the justice committee, Bob Neill, said: \u201cResearch findings in criminology, psychology and neurology indicate the need for a distinctive approach. There is overwhelming enthusiasm for change within the sector. And yet the government has been hesitant to act. We do not understand why it has not been more courageous, and has hidden behind outdated legislation. So we have used the evidence we received to develop a blueprint for change, which we expect the government to adopt as part of their forthcoming reform plan.\u201d</p> <p> A Ministry of Justice spokeswoman responded, saying: \u201cSignificant efforts have been made to divert young people from custody and this has resulted in a welcome reduction in the prison population \u2013 down 40% since 2010. But those in custody are in for longer and for more serious offences. We recognise the specific challenges associated with this age group and are committed to addressing these.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Stroll along Copenhagen\u2019s waterfront and the horizon is punctuated by the smokestacks from the power station at the tip of Amager island. Construction has just begun on a replacement that will run on fossil-fuel free biomass when it opens in 2020. Beside the power plant, the final touches are being put on the striking aluminium facade of Amager Bakke, an incinerator that will double as a recreational space for the city when it opens next year \u2013 complete with an artificial ski slope running down its wedge-shaped roof.</p> <p>Both plants will be green totems for Copenhagen\u2019s ambitions to be the first city in the world to go zero-carbon by 2025, with the incineration plant claiming to be the cleanest burning building of its kind in the world.</p> <p>But they are also emblematic of something bigger: how industry is trying to transform into something cleaner and greener.<br></p> <p>The tagline for the <a href=\"https://www.a-r-c.dk/amager-bakke\">Amager Bakke</a> incineration plant, designed by the renowned Danish architecture firm Bjarke Ingels Group (BIG), is that it will be \u201cpart of the city\u201d, providing social as well as physical infrastructure. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Tate Modern was a power plant that turned into a museum. We are trying to make a functioning power plant \u2026</p> <footer> <cite>Bjarke Ingels</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Alongside the all-weather ski slope, there will be a climbing wall to scale the 80m high structure, and a grass area on the roof for visitors to picnic on and enjoy the view over Copenhagen. It is a stark juxtaposition to the building\u2019s main purpose: where streams of trucks will deliver waste from across the city to be converted into electricity for the city\u2019s district heating system.</p> <p>BIG\u2019s founder, Bjarke Ingels, says Amager Bakke will marry art and science and \u201cchange public perceptions of what a public utility should be\u201d. Unlike London\u2019s former Bankside power station \u2013 reincarnated as the Tate Modern 20 years after it ceased to produce electricity \u2013 Amager Bakke will replace an existing power plant, adding public amenity without losing its original function, Ingels says. \u201cThe Tate Modern was a power plant that turned into a museum. What we are trying to do here is make a functioning power plant that also has these other elements.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f67d07d74abdbe56e5e1321b1afbf42fc3dd6dd2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f67d07d74abdbe56e5e1321b1afbf42fc3dd6dd2/0_0_10267_6845/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Amager Bakke incinerator and ski slope nears completion.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The incinerator and ski slope near completion.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rasmus Hjortsh\u00f8j/Coast</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>A similar transformation will take place a few hundred metres away, at the 45-year-old power plant, which currently runs on coal and biomass. The plant will be converted to run entirely on biomass and be reborn as \u201cBIO4\u201d in 2020. If Amager Bakke will serve as the city\u2019s ski resort, BIO4 will be a forestry attraction under architect Gottlieb Paludan\u2019s plans to cover the facade of the 46m high building with hanging tree trunks. The design won the Leading European Architecture Forum (Leaf) award this month.</p> <p>Frank Jensen, Copenhagen\u2019s lord mayor, says that the two plants were not situated away from the city because they need to feed into Copenhagen\u2019s highly energy-efficient district heating system \u2013 the most extensive in the world, covering <a href=\"http://www.c40.org/case_studies/98-of-copenhagen-city-heating-supplied-by-waste-heat\">98% of the capital\u2019s heat demand</a>. \u201cThe central location of our combined heat and power plants is important because it minimises the length of transportation of district heating and thus the heat loss,\u201d he says.</p> <p>J\u00f8rgen Abildgaard, the man in city hall in charge of realising Copenhagen\u2019s climate plan, explains that wind power and geothermal energy will secure Copenhagen\u2019s energy future in the long term. In the medium term, however, the power plant will use wood pellets so it can eradicate the use of coal, which currently powers more than half the district heating system. Coal is both a dirty fossil fuel and more energy intensive than wood.</p> <p>By converting completely to sustainably sourced wood pellets, the new Copenhagen system will not only be CO2-neutral but extremely low in the environmental pollutants sulphur dioxide (SO\u2082) and nitrogen oxide (NOx) \u2013 an important consideration given that the plant will be sited less than a kilometre away from homes.</p> <p>The wood pellets are sourced from waste wood that would otherwise rot and emit methane \u2013 and not from chopped down trees. </p> <p>Jesper Gottlieb, creative director of the architects behind the BIO4 power plant, says the educational function of the building was part of the brief from the city\u2019s publicly owned utility, Hofor. The public will be able to follow a nature trail up through the tree trunks to a viewing platform where they can see the workings of the plant and learn about clean and green energy.<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"7f9001b65046caf07de0d5d0669f3208dd18964c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7f9001b65046caf07de0d5d0669f3208dd18964c/143_0_2257_1354/1000.jpg\" alt=\"China\u2019s Shenzhen East Waste-to-Energy Power Plant\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">China\u2019s Shenzhen waste to energy plant is set to become the world\u2019s largest when it opens in 2020.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Schmidt Hammer Lassen Architects</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Public education will also play a big role in the design of a state-of-the art <a href=\"http://www.dezeen.com/2016/02/04/worlds-largest-waste-to-energy-plant-shenzhen-china-schmidt-hammer-lassen-gottlieb-paludan/\">incineration plant in Shenzhen in China</a>, which was recently awarded to Gottlieb Paludan and fellow Danish firm Schmidt Hammer Lassen.

It is a pressing issue for the city of Shenzhen, where late last year an illegal <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/dec/21/china-landslide-dozens-missing-shenzhen-construction-waste-collapses\">20-storey landfill site collapsed</a>, killing 58 people. </p> <p> \u201cWe are in a position where utility companies want to engage with people and show them that there are no dangerous substances coming out of their smokestacks,\u201d says Gottlieb.</p> <h2>Back to the future</h2> <p>According to BIG, sulphur dioxide emissions in Copenhagen\u2019s new waste treatment plant will be reduced by 99.5% and nitrous oxide by 90% compared with the plant it will replace.</p> <p>But Philipp Rode, executive director of the London School of Economics\u2019s cities programme, worries about having waste-to-energy plants so near a city, regardless of how advanced the technology to clean their emissions. \u201cIn the end these chimneys are still emitting something. We can\u2019t really square the circle.\u201d </p> <p>Copenhagen is an extreme example, he says, of the paradigm shift in the way many cities around the world relate to industry. In the 20th century cities began positioning industry \u2013 and the associated pollution, noise and heavy goods traffic \u2013 well away from urban centres.</p> <p>Now, Rode says, with cleaner technology and the rise of 3D printing, \u201cthere\u2019s no longer the enormous pressure to push these facilities out of the city. Instead there\u2019s excitement about maintaining diversity and keeping those [industrial] sites, and their legacy with it.\u201d </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>In the end these chimneys are still emitting something. We can\u2019t really square the circle</p> <footer> <cite>Philipp Rode</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Martin Powell, global head of urban development at Siemens, agrees. \u201cWe call them urban factories, the idea that you can have new industries being put back into the centre of the city. Cities historically have been very, very wasteful. They export a lot of waste; they use and consume a lot of energy. Now they are looking at \u2026 correcting that historical inefficiency\u201d by importing those functions again.</p> <p>He says the BIG-designed waste treatment plant in Copenhagen shows how even an industry as notoriously smelly, loud and disruptive as a waste treatment plant can be situated in a densely populated urban setting. \u201cThey are quieter; you can control the odours, and you can create recreational space around it. I always hold this [Amager Bakke] up as an example of how you should think of waste-to-energy plants going forward.\u201d</p> <p>Nina Rappaport, author of <a href=\"http://www.verticalurbanfactory.org/\">Vertical Urban Factory</a>, which charts the history of factories in cities, says the first contemporary example was Volkswagen\u2019s Glaserne Manufaktur [Transparent Factory] in Dresden in 2001. </p> <p> VW was persuaded to site the 81,600 sq m factory in the middle of the city by the municipal government in a bid to create jobs in impoverished east Germany after reunification.</p> <p>The factory, and a similar one built by BMW in Munich, have become tourist attractions, allowing people passing on the street outside to see what is happening inside.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2016/sep/23/copenhagen-christiania-drugs-commune-future\">Paradise lost: does Copenhagen\u2019s Christiania commune still have a future?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Rode says German carmakers have only been able to site factories in city centres because they have outsourced the most polluting elements of manufacturing to countries like China. \u201cWhat you have are high-end components being put together with robotic machinery.\u201d</p> <p>But the fact that the BMW plant in Munich is sited next door to the company\u2019s headquarters is also significant, he says. \u201cIt tells you a lot about Germany, that sense of bringing management and workers closer and creating a nexus of exchange between researchers and the production line. That is part of the selling proposition of the cars \u2026 It\u2019s an extended version of a flagship store.\u201d</p> <p>Rappaport says innovations such as 3D printing have allowed high-end products to be made with smaller machines \u2013 and that many companies currently manufacturing in city centres are reusing sites that housed factories early last century, but broken into small units. </p> <p>She cites examples in London\u2019s Shoreditch and Kings Cross, and the former naval works in Brooklyn, but says it could make the most difference in former industrial cities like Detroit and Manchester which have been in decline. \u201cIt\u2019s a great model, but maybe not for the most expensive cities like London, New York and Paris, where the high cost of land may make it less viable.

  "<p>The comforting tap of knitting needles, clink of teaspoons in mugs and excitable chatter fills Blakenall library in Walsall, where a group of 17 has gathered for the weekly Knit and Natter session. </p> <p>Knitting patterns and sewing books are passed around the group, whose members range from giggling octogenarians to nine-year-olds with their brows furrowed in concentration over their cross-stitching.</p> <p>Yet a sword of Damocles hangs over the gathering. On Monday, Walsall council <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/oct/24/walsall-council-seeks-residents-views-library-closures-new-art-gallery\">put forward proposals to close 15 of the 16 libraries</a> in the area in a bid to save \u00a32.9m per year. Should it go ahead, <a href=\"http://lovelibrarieswalsall.co.uk/locations/blakenall-library/\">Blakenall library</a> \u2013 and its Knit and Natter group \u2013 would be no more. </p> <p>The news of the potential mass closures came as a devastating blow to residents, who have come to rely on the library for more than borrowing books. Janet Hodson, 71, who sat with Chloe, six, Lilly, nine, and Kylie, 11, at her feet as she corrected some missed stitches in a yellow blanket they had been working on, described the proposal as diabolical.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s absolutely devastating,\u201d she said. \u201cFor an area the size of Walsall to just have one library, which for older people like me is hard to get to, is absolutely ludicrous. </p> <p>\u201cThis library means everything to me. We\u2019re here once a week at our Knit and Natter, we\u2019re here for our over-50s clubs and we have people come in for talks. It gets you out of the house for a couple of hours. Especially for my sister, who is also here; if she didn\u2019t have this group she\u2019d be sitting in the flat all day on her own.\u201d</p> <p>She added: \u201cWhere do we go if they close the libraries? And just look, it\u2019s half-term and I\u2019ve got three youngsters here learning to knit. These spaces disappear and they\u2019ve got nowhere to go.\u201d</p> <p>Indeed, figures show that the 16 libraries are not underused. Over the past two years, the libraries have had about 1 million visits, with approximately 775,000 books borrowed each year.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"57398b89789f0046b53cd8975fdc6436f2d91f02\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/57398b89789f0046b53cd8975fdc6436f2d91f02/0_92_4400_2640/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The New Art Gallery, Walsall.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Walsall\u2019s New Art Gallery also faces proposed cuts.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andrew Fox</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The news of the potential closures came as a particular blow to Kylie, 11, who promptly sat down to write the council a letter. </p> <p>\u201cThey can\u2019t close it down,\u201d she said. \u201cWe come here every day, it\u2019s just up the road so our mum lets us walk. It would be so sad if we couldn\u2019t come, we spend all our time here with the books. I love it here.\u201d</p> <p>The drastic proposal to cut all but one of the libraries is an embarrassing back pedal for the Labour-Liberal Democrat coalition council that, while in opposition, had made an explicit proposal not to cut any library services. In February, five Walsall libraries were saved from planned closures by Labour and Lib Dem councillors, who then <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-birmingham-36313770\">gained control of the council in May as a coalition</a>. </p> <p>However, this week the council was forced to admit that budget restrictions were \u201cmore severe\u201d than anticipated and <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.birminghampost.co.uk/news/regional-affairs/walsall-council-facing-86m-more-7969794\">\u00a386m needs to be found to balance the books by 2020</a>. Cuts are also being proposed to <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://thenewartgallerywalsall.org.uk/\">Walsall\u2019s New Art Gallery</a> and other services. </p> <p>\u201cThe council fully appreciates that the art gallery and libraries are much-loved by those that use them,\u201d the council said in a statement. \u201cHowever, like many councils across the country, this authority can\u2019t ignore the fact that savings have to be made.\u201d</p> <p>Another suggestion being put forward is that five Walsall libraries will be kept open, but all run on a budget of \u00a31m. Both proposals will be opened up to local residents for discussion over the next few weeks. A petition to save the libraries and art gallery had more than 2,500 signatures on Tuesday.</p> <p>For mother-of-five Louise Taylor, who home-schools her children, it would \u201cdevastate\u201d her family if Blakenall library was to shut.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>\u201cWe don\u2019t have the internet at home so we use the internet here and the children have done computer courses here and they always take out books,\u201d she said, with son Ruben, 11, sitting diligently knitting beside her. </p> <p>\u201cFor us it\u2019s really important and in this area, where there\u2019s not much in the way of money, having a resource where you can get on the internet, where you can borrow books and where you can meet other people, it\u2019s just essential.

To be able to come here, just up the road, is ideal. </p> <p>\u201cThere are quite a few people who come here who have disabilities and to close the local library means they are the ones who will suffer the most.\u201d</p> <p>At nearby Bloxwich library, Beverley Horton, 27, looked crestfallen at the news it was on the brink of closure. She indicated to her four children who rushed ahead excitedly through the library doors.</p> <p>\u201cAll my children would be gutted if it shut,\u201d she said. \u201cThey love coming here, religiously every week and getting books and bringing them all back home. Even when I was pregnant, I\u2019d read library books to the eldest when he was just a bump.\u201d</p> <p>Horton sighed deeply. \u201cWe never miss coming, it such a big part of their life.

  "<p>What is the worst thing about Donald Trump? <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/series/lyin-trump-a-weekly-fact-check\">The lies?</a> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jun/16/donald-trump-mexico-presidential-speech-latino-hispanic\">The racist stereotypes?</a> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/08/trumps-misogyny-problem-how-donald-has-repeatedly-targeted-women\">The misogyny?</a> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/12/donald-trump-women-new-sexual-harassment-stories\">The alleged gropings?</a> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/16/donald-trump-rigged-election-poll-giuliani-gingrich-pence\">The apparent refusal to accept democratic outcomes?</a> All these are bad enough. But they\u2019re not the worst. The worst thing about Donald Trump is that he\u2019s the man in the mirror.</p> <p>We love to horrify ourselves with his excesses, and to see him as a monstrous outlier, the polar opposite of everything a modern, civilised society represents. But he is nothing of the kind. He is the distillation of all that we have been induced to desire and admire. Trump is so repulsive not because he offends our civilisation\u2019s most basic values, but because he embodies them.</p> <p>Trump personifies the traits promoted by the media and corporate worlds he affects to revile; the worlds that created him. He is the fetishisation of wealth, power and image in a nation where <a href=\"http://valuesandframes.org/\">extrinsic values</a> are championed throughout public discourse. His conspicuous consumption, self-amplification and towering (if fragile) ego are in tune with the dominant narratives of our age.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The entire electoral process is stolen from the American people before they even cast their vote</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>As the recipient of vast inherited wealth who markets himself as solely responsible for his good fortune, he is the man of our times. The US Apprentice TV show which he hosted tells the story of everything he is not: the little guy dragging himself up from the bottom through enterprise and skill. None of this distinguishes him from the majority of the very rich, whose entrepreneurial image, loyally projected by the media, clashes with their histories of huge bequests, government assistance, monopolies and rent-seeking.</p> <p>If his politics differ from those of the rest of the modern Republican party, it is because he is, in some respects, more liberal. Every vice, for the Republican trailblazers such as Ted Cruz and Scott Walker, is now a virtue; every virtue a vice. Encouraged by the corporate media, the Republicans have been waging a full-spectrum assault on empathy, altruism and the decencies we owe to other people. Their gleeful stoving in of faces, their cackling destruction of political safeguards and democratic norms, their stomping on all that is generous and caring and cooperative in human nature, have turned the party into a game of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/apr/23/mortal-kombat-x-review-violent-but-charmingly-hammy\">Mortal Kombat</a> scripted by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/aug/19/reading-breitbart-news-steve-bannon-donald-trump\">Breitbart News</a>.</p> <p>Did Trump invent the xenophobia and racism that infuse his campaign? Did he invent his conspiracy theories about stolen elections and the criminality of his opponents? No. <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/elizabeth-warren-trump-didnt-invent-the-rigged-election-myth-republicans-did/2016/10/18/921ac368-953b-11e6-9b7c-57290af48a49_story.html?utm_term=.c179cfb12635\">They were there all along</a>. What is new and different about him is that he has streamlined these narratives into a virulent demagoguery. But the opportunity has been building for years; all that was required was someone blunt and unscrupulous enough to take it.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"aa6bcad86b5927c0b2bb50d979fc7a2f91b0e588\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/aa6bcad86b5927c0b2bb50d979fc7a2f91b0e588/0_15_306_317/306.jpg\" alt=\"The fourth US president, James Madison.\" width=\"306\" height=\"317\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The fourth US president, James Madison.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: White House/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Nor can you single out Trump for ignoring, denying and deriding the key issues of our time, such as climate change. Almost all prominent Republicans have been at it. In fact, across the four presidential debates, <a href=\"http://www.vox.com/2016/10/19/13342250/presidential-debates-climate-change\">not one question about climate change was asked</a>. Even when politicians and journalists accept the science, it makes little difference if they avoid the subject like the plague.</p> <p>America\u2019s fourth president, James Madison, envisaged the United States constitution as representation tempered by competition between factions. In the <a href=\"http://avalon.law.yale.edu/18th_century/fed10.asp\">10th federalist paper</a>, written in 1787, he argued that large republics were better insulated from corruption than small, or \u201cpure\u201d democracies, as the greater number of citizens would make it \u201cmore difficult for unworthy candidates to practise with success the vicious arts by which elections are too often carried\u201d. A large electorate would protect the system against oppressive interest groups. Politics practised on a grand scale would be more likely to select people of \u201cenlightened views and virtuous sentiments\u201d.</p> <p>Instead, the US \u2013 in common with many other nations \u2013 now suffers the worst of both worlds: a large electorate dominated by a tiny faction. Instead of republics being governed, as Madison feared, by \u201cthe secret wishes of an unjust and interested majority\u201d, they are beholden to the not-so-secret wishes of an unjust and interested minority. What Madison could not have foreseen was the extent to which unconstrained campaign finance and a sophisticated lobbying industry would come to dominate an entire nation, regardless of its size.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/25/elizabeth-warren-us-president-workers-rights-wall-street\">Elizabeth Warren is the US president we need, but can\u2019t have \u2013 this time | Owen Jones</a> </p> </aside>  <p>For every representative, Republican or Democrat, who retains a trace element of independence, there are three sitting in the breast pocket of corporate capital. Since the supreme court decided that there should be no effective limits on campaign finance, and, to a lesser extent, long before, candidates have been reduced to tongue-tied automata, incapable of responding to those in need of help, incapable of regulating those in need of restraint, for fear of upsetting their funders.</p> <p>Democracy in the US is so corrupted by money that it is no longer recognisable as democracy. You can kick individual politicians out of office, but what do you do when the entire structure of politics is corrupt? Turn to the demagogue who rages into this political vacuum, denouncing the forces he exemplifies. The problem is not, as Trump claims, that the election will be stolen by ballot rigging. It is that the entire electoral process is stolen from the American people before they get anywhere near casting their votes. When Trump claims that the little guy is being screwed by the system, he\u2019s right. The only problem is that he is the system.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video element--supporting\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/oct/18/donald-trump-sexual-allegations-nine-women-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/583qb\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2817569\"            data-video-name=\"Eleven women who have accused Trump of sexual misconduct \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"Guardian, Access Hollywood, AP, CNN, Getty Images, NBC, Reuters, Palm Beach Post\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-58066cf1e4b0cd26ff71e6cc\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/10/24/161024women_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/10/24/161024women.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/10/24/161024women_KP-2166838.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/oct/18/donald-trump-sexual-allegations-nine-women-video\">Eleven women who have accused Trump of sexual misconduct</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>The political constitution of the United States is not, as Madison envisaged, representation tempered by competition between factions. The true constitution is plutocracy tempered by scandal. In other words, all that impedes the absolute power of money is the occasional exposure of the excesses of the wealthy. What distinguishes Trump\u2019s political career is that, until recently, his scandals have done him no harm.</p> <p>Trump disgusts us because, where others use a dog whistle, he uses a klaxon. We hate to hear his themes so clearly articulated. But we know in our hearts that they suffuse the way the world is run.</p> <p>Because this story did not begin with Trump, it will not end with Trump, however badly he may lose the election. Yes, he is a shallow, mendacious, boorish and extremely dangerous man. But those traits ensure that he is not an outsider but the perfect representation of his caste, the caste that runs the global economy and governs our politics. He is our system, stripped of its pretences.</p>",

From that first cocktail party, it was like this instant calibration between souls, as if we had known each other once before. Friendship ripened into something bolder, trust in a very strange situation was formed, and now every adventure we have rivals the other- and continues to make plans for itself. Yesterday I flew this beautiful woman to The Abrolhos islands for her 30th birthday!  I have to admit that I felt so so proud to be with her, my favourite person, celebrating such a momentous occasion on the water- a mutual love of ours. She is so confident in the ocean and in every adventure, as if every new experience is a winning of the lottery somehow; a chance to grow and learn and develop. To Tiffany, experience wins over the worldly acquisition of &amp;#39;things&amp;#39; every time- and I think this is why she is so open-minded, so accepting of others, so fun and so at ease with letting winds blow her towards a variety of opportunities. She&amp;#39;s helped me to disintegrate many of the ideals I&amp;#39;ve had that were harmful (about relationships, about career and &amp;#39;stability&amp;#39;) and for that I feel set free. Thank you for always asking questions (detective Tiff), for being curious about people, ideologies and the universe; for loving people with such a wholesome love that I don&amp;#39;t know if I would ever be able to emulate. It inspires me. Happy Birthday Tiffany.

  "<p>Taken today the photograph would barely cause a blink. Two elated baseball players \u2013 one white, one black \u2013 are hugging in the clubhouse after a big World Series game victory. They have wide smiles. Their eyes are closed. Their cheeks are pressed together. One of them will later laugh that it appears like he is about to kiss the other. It looks like any picture you might see of two happy teammates a win a way from the world championship.<br></p> <p>Until you realize the photo was taken in 1948. And then it becomes something a whole lot more.</p> <p>\u201cThe chief message \u2026 is acceptance,\u201d a columnist for the African-American Pittsburgh Courier <a href=\"http://www.thedeadballera.com/Obits/Obits_G/Gromek.Steve.Obit.html\">wrote at the time.</a></p> <p>\u201cMy dad got all kinds of resentment about that picture,\u201d the white man\u2019s son says.</p> <p>\u201cI always cherish that photograph,\u201d the black man <a href=\"http://www.thedeadballera.com/Obits/Obits_G/Gromek.Steve.Obit.html\">later said</a>.</p> <p>On 9 October 1948 the Cleveland Indians beat the Boston Braves 3-1 in Game 4 of the World Series to come within a victory of what would become the team\u2019s last World Championship. The winning pitcher was the white man in the photo, Steve Gromek, who grew up in a blue collar suburb of Detroit. The game-winning home run was hit by the black man, Larry Doby, who the year before had become the second black player in the major leagues, debuting just weeks after Jackie Robinson. By all accounts the men were friends and so it didn\u2019t strike Gromek as odd when as he was being interviewed after the game, someone called Doby over and the team\u2019s center fielder <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2002/03/23/sports/steve-gromek-82-a-pitcher-who-is-best-known-for-a-picture.html\">threw his arm over the pitcher\u2019s shoulder</a>. Gromek just hugged him back.</p> <p>A photographer from the Cleveland Plain Dealer lifted his camera.</p> <p>Flash.</p> <p>Click.</p> <p>The photo <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2002/03/23/sports/steve-gromek-82-a-pitcher-who-is-best-known-for-a-picture.html\">was disseminated around the country</a> and ran in papers all over the United States. The players hardly seemed to care. \u201cMy father didn\u2019t see color,\u201d Gromek\u2019s son Greg says. They were too happy to be so close to a world championship, which Cleveland clinched two games later. But plenty of people did mind. The idea of whites and blacks playing, traveling and changing together in the same clubhouse was still new. The Civil Rights and Voting Rights Acts were more than a decade and a half away. The image of white and African-American team-mates embracing so naturally, with cheeks touching, angered plenty.</p> <p>After the Series, when Gromek returned home to Hamtramck, Michigan, he was anything but a World Series hero to many around town. Letters poured in from infuriated racists irate that a white player would ever pose for such a picture. While the mail was unsettling, Gromek seemed to ignore the contents, Greg Gromek recalls. What really bothered Steve Gromek were the things said by local residents, people he grew up with, people he thought he knew.</p> <p>\u201cSome of his friends really reacted negatively,\u201d Greg Gromek says. \u201cThey said things that were sort of shocking to him. What bothered him was that these were his friends. He kept thinking: \u2018What kind of friend are you to say these things?\u2019\u201d</p> <p>On the phone from his Michigan office where he is a lawyer, Greg Gromek pauses.</p> <p>\u201cHe even got death threats,\u201d Greg Gromek says. \u201cThat\u2019s what was really shocking.\u201d</p> <p>Steve Gromek never showed Greg the hate mail. The son says he doesn\u2019t know if his father kept it. But the fact people could be so vicious over a photograph following the biggest moment of his baseball life bothered Steve Gromek until his death in 2002. Growing up outside Detroit, Greg Gromek says, Steve never learned the same racism that was taught in other homes. All Steve cared about as a child was playing baseball and chased games wherever they were, even into neighborhoods that were predominately African-American. Doby\u2019s arrival in July 1947 never bothered him, Greg says, he was glad to have another talented teammate.</p> <p>Not every player was like Steve Gromek, however. And while Doby never gets the same acclaim as Robinson, nor the credit as a player, the two men had similarly successful careers on the field and equally as difficult a time off it. University of Pittsburgh law professor Douglas Branson, the author of April\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.nebraskapress.unl.edu/product/Greatness-in-the-Shadows,677150.aspx\">Greatness In The Shadows</a>, a Doby biography, says Doby was constantly harassed by fans and opponents. Once, a heckler who had berated Robinson when the Dodgers played in Philadelphia against the Phillies showed up for three straight days when the Indians played Philadelphia\u2019s American League team, the Athletics, then followed Cleveland to New York where he spent another game screaming at him from the stands.</p> <p>Cleveland\u2019s owner, Bill Veeck, legendary as a baseball pioneer, moved the team\u2019s spring training camp from Florida to Arizona hoping to spare Doby (and other black players) the racism of the deep south, only to learn the team hotel in Arizona wouldn\u2019t accommodate African-American guests. Many times, Branson says, Doby and Robinson talked on the phone, sharing stories of their loneliness and passing on tips of hotels and restaurants that accepted black customers.</p> <p>\u201cI think he suffered even more hardship than Jackie Robinson did,\u201d Branson says, pointing out that Robinson and other African Americans on the Brooklyn Dodgers and New York Giants like Roy Campanella, Don Newcombe, Willie Mays and Monte Irvin were more celebrated because they played in New York instead of Cleveland like Doby.</p> <p>Still, Doby did have friends on the Indians including the team\u2019s star third baseman Al Rosen. Branson also says that there were many in baseball, including the majority of the sports writers, who supported Robinson and Doby, pulling for them to succeed. He believes the photograph of Doby and Gromek reflect that emotion.</p> <p>\u201cIt corroborates a lot of people\u2019s positive feelings,\u201d he says.</p> <p>Doby, who died in 2003, remained moved by the photo of he and Gromek, <a href=\"http://www.thedeadballera.com/Obits/Obits_G/Gromek.Steve.Obit.html\">once saying</a>: \u201cIt proved that emotions can be put into a form not based on skin color.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat was a feeling from within, the human side of two people, one black and one white,\u201d Doby said <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Gromek#cite_note-34\">after his election to the Baseball Hall of Fame</a> in 1998. \u201cThat made up for everything I went through. I would always relate back to that whenever I was insulted or rejected from hotels. I\u2019d always think about that picture. It would take away all the negatives.\u201d</p> <p>Gromek and Doby would play together in Cleveland until 1953 when Gromek was traded to his hometown Detroit Tigers, before retiring in 1957 with 124 regular and post-season victories, none more important than the one that put the Indians within a win of their last title.</p> <p>In his home outside Detroit, Greg Gromek has a copy of the photo of his father and Doby signed by both players. For years he he looked at it, cropped close around the men\u2019s heads, and assumed it was part of a bigger team celebration. It was only recently, when an associate\u2019s wife had been doing some research and found an un-cropped version of the picture that he could see the lockers behind them and realized it was just the two of them. Suddenly the photo had more power for him, showing that the two men had sought each other out for an embrace rather than merely joining in a group party.</p> <p>Before he hangs up he has one more story, one told many times by his father about those days after the World Series when many in the town were angry with him. Someone complained about the photograph to their local priest who contemplated the picture of the men embracing before replying:</p> <p>\u201cIf a black man hit a home run to win a World Series game for me, I\u2019d do even more than that!\u201d</p>",
  "<p>It happened in a classroom, on the desks of the village school. It was dark, so the doctor operated on the women by torchlight. The procedure only took two minutes; many women did not even know that they had been permanently sterilised.</p> <p>That Saturday night, in January 2012, 53 women from the village of Kaparfora in the northern Indian state of Bihar <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/apr/15/uk-aid-forced-sterilisation-india\">had tubectomies over a period of two hours</a>, under the supervision of a local NGO. The school desks where the operations took place were never disinfected; the doctor never changed his gloves, and the medicines were past their use-by dates, violating a number of government guidelines. After the operations, the doctor left the school, ignoring the wails of the bleeding women in the classroom.</p> <p>Devika Biswas, a health activist from the region, who visited Kaparfora a month after the event on a fact-finding mission, says she was \u201caghast\u201d at the conditions she saw. \u201cI was feeling so bad. I thought, is this my country? Not a single woman was screened to see if there would be any complications. One of the women who was sterilised was actually three months pregnant, and she ended up miscarrying her baby.

That\u2019s seriously how the MLB determines this.

By an <a href=\"http://www.oddsshark.com/mlb/chicago-cubs-cleveland-indians-betting-october-25-2016-749662\">overwhelming degree</a>, World Series Game 1 winners tend to go to win the whole thing.<br></p> <p>There\u2019s obviously a lot of storylines going on tonight. There\u2019s the Cubs\u2019 108 year championship drought (you might have heard those of us in the media mention it every once and a while.) This has somewhat overshadowed the fact that the Indians haven\u2019t won since the more comparatively recent year of 1948. Considering that the Indians have made the World Series, for the first time since 1997, just months after LeBron James and the Cavaliers won the city\u2019s first NBA title, it feels like there wouldn\u2019t be a better time to break that title-less streak than the present.</p> <p>There\u2019s also slightly less \u201cfun fact\u201d-y subject matter to go, whether it be about Cleveland\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/17/ontario-alcs-blue-jays-indians-chief-wahoo-offensive\">culturally insensitive logo</a> being plastered everywhere or the prominent role Chicago\u2019s closer Aroldis Chapman, mere months removed from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/17/ontario-alcs-blue-jays-indians-chief-wahoo-offensive\">a MLB-imposed suspension</a> for domestic violence, has played in this postseason. <br></p> <p>Because of all this, it\u2019s easy to forget that this isn\u2019t going to be a referendum on which team is easier to root for or on which franchise has the worst \u201ccurse.\u201d It\u2019s going to come down to, well, baseball. <br></p> <p>That starts with the starters. Indians manager Terry Francona is putting Corey Kluber (18-9, 3.14) on the mound against the Cubs\u2019 Jon Lester (18-9, 3.14), who he used to manage back when they were with the Boston Red Sox. (The Boston GM during that era? None other than current Cubs President of Baseball Operation Theo Epstein. I told you, there\u2019s a lot of subplots for the taking tonight.)</p> <p>If you want to join in, we welcome your contributions here at the Guardian.

I could talk about how Cleveland\u2019s Terry Francona is a far superior in-game tactician than Chicago\u2019s Joe Maddon or that the Cubs starters should more than nullify the fact that Andrew Miller is the greatest postseason relief pitcher since Mariano Rivera. No, instead, my prediction will be based solely on a classic <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDGsh-Hrxho\">Mountain Goats song</a>.

In this scenario, senate candidate Patrick Murphy upsets Marco Rubio in Florida and the Democrats end up with a 54-seat senate majority.

  "<p>Pokies are deliberately designed to deceive people about their prospects of winning, a lawsuit filed against casino giant Crown Melbourne and pokies manufacturer Aristocrat Technologies alleges.</p> <p>The landmark action was filed to the federal court by law firm Maurice Blackburn on Wednesday morning.</p> <p> Maurice Blackburn principal Jacob Varghese said the firm had previously written to Aristocrat and Crown inviting them to talk about possible solutions to the alleged deceptive design of the machines.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/oct/29/to-beat-the-pokies-we-must-change-our-idea-of-personal-responsibility\">To beat the pokies, we must change our idea of 'personal responsibility' | Jacob Varghese</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Varghese alleged the machines breach consumer law because of \u201ctricks players aren\u2019t aware of that mislead the player into believing they are winning\u201d. He said he was confident in the action taking on Crown.</p> <p>\u201cWe are a country governed by laws, not by money,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is no amount of money you can throw at an issue to cover up the fact that the design of the game is in breach of Australian consumer law.</p> <p>\u201cI think there is a growing understanding in Australia that pokies are a particularly Australian problem with devastating consequences for individuals, families and communities.\u201d</p> <p>A Crown spokeswoman only said that \u201cCrown will vigorously defend any claim<em>\u201d. </em></p> <p>In a statement, Aristocrat said the company had not received any formal communication about the law suit being filed.</p> <p>\u201cAristocrat emphatically rejects any suggestion that its games are designed to encourage problem gambling, or in any way fail to comply with all relevant regulations and laws,\u201d the statement said.<br><br>\u201cAristocrat has long supported balanced and fact-based harm minimisation initiatives,recognising that these issues are complex and multi-faceted, and require ongoing collaborative effort on the part of industry, regulators and the broader community.\u201d</p> <p>The case is the first of its kind, and will focus in particular on the design of the \u201cDolphin Treasure\u201d machine.</p> <p>A gambling researcher from Monash University\u2019s department of health social science, Charles Livingstone, said the Dolphin machine had been chosen because it represented a typical poker machine and included a number of allegedly deceptive qualities in its design.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>\u201cAll poker machines currently on the market include three key features that are a function of their programming that are [allegedly] deceptive,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cOne is a loss disguised as a win, when the machine provides bells and whistles a reinforcement effect even when the amount won is less than the amount wagered. This \u2018win\u2019 is completely illusory and is a key element for the establishment of what we call addiction.\u201d</p> <p>He said the multiple-line poker wheel machines, where players win if they match up a certain number of symbols in a row, were also deceptive because there was a different number of winning symbols on each electronic wheel.</p> <p>Some of the wheels were \u201cstarved of winning symbols,\u201d he said, making it unlikely the player could ever win.</p> <p>The third deceptive mechanism mentioned in the legal claim focuses on the return to player ratio. Most poker machines say they have a return to player ratio of around 85%, meaning that in a $1 spend, the player can expect to walk away with at least 85 cents.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/oct/17/packers-crown-casino-company-unable-to-contact-18-employees-detained-in-china\">Packer's Crown casino company unable to contact 18 employees detained in China</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cBut the 15% is taken at each transaction,\u201d Livingstone said. \u201cIt means if you put $100 in and hit spin every three seconds, you can go through that cash in just 45 seconds. Most people don\u2019t comprehend that. It\u2019s not well promoted or understood and it\u2019s rarely understood by regulators either.\u201d</p> <p>Maurice Blackburn is hoping Crown and Aristocrat will be forced to remove the machines or change their design. The lead applicant in the case, Shonica Guy, played poker machines for 14 years, suffering significant losses. She first started playing at the age of 17.</p> <p>She claims she would never have become addicted without the allegedly deceptive mechanisms built into the machines.</p>",
