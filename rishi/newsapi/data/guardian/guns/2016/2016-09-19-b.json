  "<p>When Annabel Crabb was collecting stories for her book The Wife Drought: Why women need wives and men need lives, I told her about a moment in my career when I had returned to work after parental leave.</p> <p>It was six o\u2019clock in the morning and an international teleconference that I was chairing was interrupted by my three children. They were devastated that their pet guinea pig had given birth during the night and that daddy guinea pig had proceeded to eat the babies, and chaos ensued. Throughout this episode, I continued to mute and unmute my line, trying to give the impression that nothing unusual was happening. </p> <p> If this were to take place today, I would no longer pretend that all was well in the background.</p> <p>Life is messy. If we want our best and brightest in the workforce, we need to accept that they have complex lives. We need to be flexible when it comes to the realities of balancing career and family. </p> <p>Being flexible at work doesn\u2019t just benefit people trying to balance their outside lives with work. An extensive body of research demonstrates the business benefits of flexible working. Yet despite this overwhelming evidence, access to flexible work and careers is not widespread. Flexible work is still regarded as an add-on, something we do for mothers for a few months when they are back from parental leave.</p> <p>But in the face of rapid changes to the way we work, organisations need to move beyond just having policies for flexible working or making ad-hoc adjustments for certain individuals. Companies need to fundamentally rethink the way they design work and jobs.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2016/sep/14/millennials-work-purpose-linkedin-survey\">Millennials want purpose over paychecks. So why can't we find it at work?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The World Economic Forum predicts that we are on the cusp of a <a href=\"https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2016/01/the-fourth-industrial-revolution-what-it-means-and-how-to-respond\" rel=\"nofollow\">fourth industrial revolution</a>. Technological, socioeconomic and demographic shifts are transforming the way we work, demanding flexibility in the way individuals, teams and organisations work. </p> <p>At Diversity Council Australia, we all work flexibly. As a leader, thinking flexibly wasn\u2019t something that came naturally to me (at first). Yet by looking at our organisation as a whole from a flexible mindset, I could see the benefits.</p> <p>We all have different things happening in our lives at different times. Not just caring for young kids, but other family members, community roles, study and volunteering. And all of these parts of our identities bring with them different skill sets.</p> <p>These days we have DCA staff who work remotely, staff who work compressed weeks, staff who are part-time. And it works. Because we designed it that way. And because we want it to. </p> <p>In today\u2019s workforce, fewer people identify with the stereotype of the ideal worker \u2013 a full-time, fully committed employee without personal or family commitments that impact on availability. <br></p> <p>For 63% of two-parent families with dependent children in Australia, both parents are employed full time. Then there are those increasingly facing elder care commitments. And more people are interested in working for themselves. All these employee segments seek flexible work and this demand is likely to increase in the future.</p> <p>There are a few factors driving the demand for increased flexibility. Globalisation is one. The development of a 24/7 marketplace, and the rapid expansion of the services economy are also having a transformational effect on the workplace, requiring organisations to think creatively about how they can best organise jobs and work to respond to an increasingly diverse and demanding customer base. </p> <p>Similarly technology is driving \u2013 and enabling \u2013 greater flexibility. It is dramatically reshaping our workplaces, blurring the boundaries between work and home and diversifying where, when and how employees work. Advances in mobile, internet and cloud technologies, the rapid development of computing power, and the digital connection between multiple objects have all driven workplace innovations such as remote working, telecommuting, coworking spaces, video/teleconferencing, and virtual teams and collaboration. </p> <p>So the future of work demands new approaches to work design \u2013 but have workplaces risen to the challenge? The evidence suggests we have yet to grasp this opportunity to be more innovative.</p> <p>While some employers are making flexible work more available, there is still a high prevalence of bolted-on temporary arrangements. These arrangements are seen as the exception to the rule, with the full-time, \u201cface-time\u201d, long hours \u201cideal worker\u201d still the model to which everyone is expected to adhere.</p> <p>So what does it take to redesign work? DCA\u2019s new research project, <a href=\"https://www.dca.org.au/files/file/Research/DCA%20Future%20Flex%20Synopsis%20Online%20Accessible.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">Future-Flex</a>, recommends workplace flexibility based on a work design mindset.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2016/aug/11/time-for-men-to-sign-up-to-female-dominated-caring-and-sharing-jobs\">Time for men to sign up to female-dominated caring and sharing jobs</a> </p> </aside>  <p>More than just accommodating one person\u2019s needs, it\u2019s about redesigning work at a team or whole organisation level, where employees are key partners in developing team-based flexibility solutions.</p> <p>It\u2019s about flexibility being seen as a business tool that can improve the performance and wellbeing of organisations, teams and individuals, while meeting business goals.</p> <p>It\u2019s about getting the culture right so it is supportive of flexibility. So employees can access flexibility for all roles and for any reason \u2013 and throughout their careers.</p> <p>And it\u2019s about being aware of our own biases \u2013 conscious and unconscious. Many people make assumptions about flexible workers, including that they\u2019re not interested in training and development, aren\u2019t committed to the organisation, or don\u2019t have any career aspirations. We need to explore and challenge these biases.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>There are good international examples of successful work redesign that have involved the input of a team of employees. For example, a <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.aperio.cz/zdrava-firma-2014/doc/02_flexbetterworkingguide.pdf)\" rel=\"nofollow\">UK bakery sat down</a> with their bakers and came up with a flexible system of two to three baking shifts a day to maintain a steady supply of fresh bread. The team agreed to rotate their hours each week so no team member permanently worked a shift that did not suit. After the change was made, bakery sales increased by more than 65% in the first year and employee satisfaction in the bakery has risen 10% since the change to 93%. </p> <p>At an international hotel chain, long work hours and 24/7 operations were taking their toll on managers. A team-based process was implemented to improve work-life fit for managers while maintaining customer service. The criteria for success were that it reduced work hours, stress and job burnout, had no adverse financial impact on business, and sustained high-quality customer service. The results were very positive. Managers\u2019 work hours were reduced by five hours a week. Low-value work decreased by 50%. There was no negative cost or organisational impact and stress and work-life conflicts reduced significantly.</p> <p>So work redesign is not only doable, it can deliver business benefits, although it does require a completely new approach.</p> <p>With the support of the Retail Council, National Australia Bank, Allens, IBM, BAE Systems Australia and IAG, DCA has developed <a href=\"https://www.dca.org.au/files/file/Research/DCA%20Future%20Flex%20Synopsis%20Online%20Accessible.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">new tools</a> to help Australian organisations in the retail sector to increase flexibility.</p> <p>By changing our thinking and focusing on the team and the organisation as a whole, rather than the individual, we have the opportunity to create more adaptable and sustainable workplaces \u2013 with or without guinea pigs.</p>",
  "<p>The number of smokers in England has fallen to its lowest level, with just one in six adults now lighting up, according to new official figures, which also show a recent collapse in sales of cigarettes.</p> <p>Just 16.9% of adults in England now smoke, according to the latest data from Public Health England. Its health experts also revealed that widespread use of e-cigarettes, nicotine patches and gum helped 500,000 smokers last year kick the habit \u2013 the highest number on record. <br></p> <p>The statistics show that, bar two small blips, smoking prevalence has declined continuously and dramatically over the past 50 years by about two-thirds. In 1974, over 50% of men in Britain were smokers; that had fallen to just 19.1% in England in 2015. Similarly, just over 40% of women smoked back then; last year it was only 14.9%. </p> <p>There are now just 7.2 million adults in England who smoke. They are far outnumbered by 14.6 million ex-smokers. It is the first time that under 17% of the population are smokers and is down from the 19.3% seen as recently as 2012. </p> <p>Health campaigners said that smoking\u2019s continuing fall in popularity is due to a combination of tough measures, such as price rises and the introduction of plain packaging, and mass media campaigns urging people to quit. </p> <p>Doctors welcomed the news but pointed out that about 200 people still die prematurely every day in England as a result of heart attacks, strokes and breathing problems caused by smoking. </p> <p>Prof Kevin Fenton, PHE\u2019s national director of health and wellbeing, hailed the diminishing appeal of smoking as \u201camazing\u201d. But he warned that, at 7.2 million, the number of people still lighting up regularly remained worryingly high. </p> <p>\u201cAlongside unhealthy diet, smoking is the biggest cause of preventable early death in England, accounting for over 78,000 deaths a year,\u201d said Fenton. \u201cQuitters will soon see they have reduced blood pressure, easier breathing and better circulation.\u201d <br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/sep/2016-09-20T09:05:30/embed.html\" data-alt=\"Graphic of percentage of smokers in England over time\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/sep/2016-09-20T09:05:30/embed.html\">Graphic of percentage of smokers in England over time</a> </figure>  <p>PHE hopes that the figures will encourage even more people to stop using cigarettes. They have emerged just before the start of the annual Stoptober, the agency\u2019s \u201cmass quitting challenge\u201d, which kicks off for the fifth time on 1 October. </p> <p>Dr Mike Knapton, associate medical director at the British Heart Foundation, said: \u201cQuitting smoking is the single best thing you can do for your heart health. By giving up smoking you\u2019ll be dramatically reducing your chances of having a potentially deadly heart attack or stroke.\u201d </p> <p>The breakdown of smoking rates in England\u2019s nine regions shows a north-south divide. The north-east has the highest proportion of smokers at 18.7%, closely followed by the north-west and Yorkshire and the Humber, in each of which it is 18.6%. </p> <p>The south-west has the lowest percentage. Just 15.5% of adults there light up. It is 15.7% in the West Midlands, 15.9% in the south-east and 16.3% in London.</p> <p>Poorer people are also much more likely to smoke than the better-off. While one in five (20.4%) of the most deprived people in England light up, just 14.3% of the least deprived in society do so. </p> <p>People of Asian backgrounds are the least likely to smoke \u2013 just 10% do so. Smoking is commonest among those of mixed race, of whom 22.4% light up. </p> <p>Smoking\u2019s decline is also underscored by data from consumer analysts Nielsen showing that the number of cigarettes sold in England and Wales has plunged by 20% in the past two years. </p> <p>PHE said that about 2.5 million people tried to give up smoking last year. Just over a million of them used e-cigarettes to boost their efforts, while about 700,000 were helped by nicotine replacement therapy products, such as gum and patches. </p> <p>Of those 2.5 million would-be quitters, one in five succeeded \u2013 the best-ever rate. That was up from the 13.6% success rate seen as recently as 2010. </p> <p>Deborah Arnott, chief executive of the campaign group Action on Smoking and Health (Ash), said: \u201cThe continuing decline in smoking prevalence is a tribute to many years when successive governments have implemented comprehensive and progressive tobacco control strategies, including tax rises, mass media campaigns, anti-smuggling measures, smoke-free laws, advertising bans, and last but not least getting rid of tobacco displays and glitzy tobacco packaging.\u201d</p> <p>However, Ash is \u201cvery concerned\u201d that government funding for mass media campaigns \u2013 which are proven to be effective at prompting people to try to quit \u2013 has fallen sharply from almost \u00a325m in 2009-10 to just \u00a34m in 2016-17. Arnott called on ministers to reverse that trend, increase investment in such initiatives and publish a new tobacco control strategy, as the last one expired at the end of 2015. </p> <p>Rosanna O\u2019Connor, PHE\u2019s director of drugs, alcohol and tobacco, said: \u201cMarketing campaigns and price increases are especially useful in triggering quit attempts.</p> <p>\u201cBut we are also influenced by the people around us. The more ex-smokers there are among your friends and family, the more likely you are to quit for good and the less likely your children are to start.\u201d</p>",

Before the last election she announced the new Northern Beaches hospital would also be privately run.</p> <p>Hospitals are in a bind. There is only one source that can reliably commit to funding growing hospital healthcare costs: the federal government. And both Labor and Liberal parties have made it clear they are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jul/03/but-what-does-it-mean-key-election-policy-issues-analysed-by-our-expert-panel\">unwilling to commit the necessary funds</a>.</p> <p>Add to that an ideological commitment that \u201cprivate\u201d always equals \u201cmore efficient\u201d and you have a recipe for mass privatisation of our healthcare system.</p> <p>But NSW should think very carefully before it rushes down this path.</p> <p>So far, the state government hasn\u2019t met much resistance. </p> <p>The optics are clever: private operation is announced along with bright, shiny, new buildings. Existing staff get to get to stay on their government contracts for two years (only to likely be forced to accept new conditions or lose their positions after this). And most importantly, public patients are promised they will still be covered as-normal in the private system. Basically, the government minimises any complaints at the time of its announcement.</p> <p>But history tells us the reality of this privatisation-light isn\u2019t always so rosy. And by the time people start getting upset it can be too late, with the government locked into a 10-, 20- or even 50-year contract with a private operator.</p> <p>Just look at some examples. At Royal North Shore hospital, where the cleaning and portering (moving patients around) was outsourced, it didn\u2019t take long for the profit-motive and quality care to come into conflict.</p> <p>Doctors complained of being unable to control patient care because of resource constraints. There were <a href=\"http://www.smh.com.au/national/health/patients-at-risk-in-hospital-dispute-20120502-1xzgi.html\">reports</a> of infectious patients being left for hours in hospital corridors, because no clean rooms were available.

Outsourcing or privatising public hospitals may be an easy political sell, but adding a profit motive to the operation of hospitals that are already expected to provide more than they can afford is a risky way of doing business. </p>",
  "<p>With the launch of Oliver Stone\u2019s Snowden film this past weekend came a renewed push for a <a href=\"https://pardonsnowden.org/\">pardon</a> for Edward Snowden from the world\u2019s leading human rights organizations.<br></p> <p>But predictably, not everyone agreed that he should be pardoned. On Saturday, the Washington Post editorial board deplorably <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/edward-snowden-doesnt-deserve-a-pardon/2016/09/17/ec04d448-7c2e-11e6-ac8e-cf8e0dd91dc7_story.html?utm_term=.84847715b7f9\">editorialized against it</a> despite its own paper winning the Pulitzer Prize for reporting on his leaked documents.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/14/edward-snowden-pardon-bernie-sanders-daniel-ellsberg\">'Edward Snowden did this country a great service. Let him come home'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>They joined many of his other detractors in making old and factually incorrect arguments about what Snowden actually did. As the movement demanding his exoneration grows nonetheless, here are five common misconceptions about the whistleblower \u2013 and why they are wrong. </p> <h2><strong>Snowden did not take 1.5m documents and dump them en masse on the internet </strong></h2> <p>Snowden critics love to pretend that everything the public learned from his disclosures was solely because he chose to release the information. In reality, the number of documents that Snowden published himself is zero. Instead of dumping a mass of documents on the internet, he gave them to experienced national security reporters who worked at some of the most respected news outlets in the country. He relied on their judgments about what was in the public interest. And those reporters allowed the government to make objections (some of which they listened to) tied to national security concerns. </p> <p>The Washington Post claimed, as others have in the past, that Snowden copied and kept 1.5m classified documents. Snowden\u2019s lawyer, Ben Wizner, has called that number \u201c<a href=\"https://twitter.com/benwizner/status/777885903024975873\">absurd</a>\u201d and \u201c<a href=\"https://twitter.com/benwizner/status/777899804076670976\">made up</a>\u201d. Even the former NSA director himself admitted that the 1.5m number only represented the documents that Snowden \u201ctouched\u201d, and officials didn\u2019t know how many he actually took.</p> <p>The real number is likely at least an order of magnitude lower, according to public comments by the journalists involved, which the Post editorial board could have found out if they had bothered to ask their own colleagues.</p> <h2><strong>There\u2019s no evidence Snowden \u2018harmed national security\u2019</strong></h2> <p>The House intelligence committee published an error-riddled report on Snowden last week, making vague claims about \u201cdamage\u201d to national security in a naked attempt to counter the narrative in Oliver Stone\u2019s movie. Three-time Pulitzer prize winner Barton Gellman <a href=\"https://tcf.org/content/commentary/house-intelligence-committees-terrible-horrible-bad-snowden-report/\">dismantled the whole report point-by-point</a> on his blog.</p> <p>We know the US government makes all sorts of dire predictions when information is leaked to the press (the Pentagon Papers, the Chelsea Manning disclosures and the release of the torture report, to name a few cases), and it is always caught exaggerating. The Snowden disclosures are no exception. As the Washington Post <a href=\"https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20131224/01373925683/james-clapper-admits-private-that-hes-really-not-too-concerned-about-terrorists-changing-communications-after-snowden.shtml\">reported two years ago</a>:</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/help/2016/sep/19/how-to-contact-the-guardian-securely\">How to contact the Guardian securely</a> </p> </aside>  <blockquote> <p>[Director of national intelligence James] Clapper has said repeatedly in public that the leaks did great damage, but in private he has taken a more nuanced stance. A review of early damage assessments in previous espionage cases, he said in one closed-door briefing this fall, found that dire forecasts of harm were seldom borne out. </p> </blockquote> <p>The House intelligence committee did not point to a single concrete example of how national security was harmed solely by the Snowden disclosures. </p> <h2><strong>Snowden could not go through \u2018proper channels\u2019 to blow the whistle </strong></h2> <p>The idea that Snowden is not a \u201cwhistleblower\u201d because he didn\u2019t <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/may/29/nsa-email-snowden-surveillance-internal-whistleblowing\">go through</a> internal government channels to make his claims is absurd on two fronts. First, at the time Snowden gave his material to the Guardian and Washington Post, he was a government contractor, and contractors were exempt from most whistleblower protections given to national security employees. (Politifact <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/oct/14/hillary-clinton/clinton-says-nsa-leaker-snowden-failed-use-whistle/\">called Hillary Clinton\u2019s statement</a> that he had access to whistleblower protections \u201cmostly false\u201d.)</p> <p>But this argument is a red herring anyway. Snowden was not blowing the whistle on some rogue NSA agent or a program that only a handful of people knew about. These mass surveillance programs (later ruled illegal) were approved at the highest levels of the executive branch and by the Fisa court. Snowden would have essentially been telling his superiors, who already knew about them and were tasked with carrying them out, that they themselves were breaking the law. </p> <h2><strong>Snowden did not \u2018flee\u2019 to Russia and has regularly criticized Russia\u2019s human rights record</strong></h2> <p>There is a persistent yet false accusation that since Snowden is in exile in Russia, he \u201cfled\u201d there and has cooperated with the Russian government (in the words of the Post\u2019s editorial, \u201cMr Snowden hurt his own credibility as an avatar of freedom by accepting <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/snowden-leaves-moscow-airport-to-live-in-russia/2013/08/01/2f2d1aba-faa9-11e2-a369-d1954abcb7e3_story.html\">asylum</a> from Russia\u2019s Vladi\u00admir Putin\u201d). </p> <p>This is false. The only reason he is in Russia is because the US government canceled his passport as he was transiting through the Russian airport to Latin America. He was marooned there against his will. Everyone, including Snowden himself, wishes he wasn\u2019t in Russia, but the alternative is being thrown in a maximum security prison in the United States. At least right now he is <a href=\"http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2016/06/edward-snowden-life-as-a-robot.html\">free to participate in the international debate virtually</a>. </p> <p>Snowden has harshly criticized Russia\u2019s human rights and civil liberties record so many times at this point that it is hard to count (including, in 2014, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/apr/18/vladimir-putin-surveillance-us-leaders-snowden\">in an op-ed for the Guardian</a>). Snowden\u2019s condemnation has been so strong that the former US ambassador to Russia (and Snowden critic) Michael McFaul recently <a href=\"https://twitter.com/McFaul/status/751752731769999360\">tweeted</a>: \u201c@<a href=\"https://twitter.com/Snowden\">Snowden</a> makes a stronger statement about human rights regression in Russia than anything I ever said as [Ambassador]. Wow.\u201d </p> <h2><strong>He cannot make his case to a jury in what the Post called the \u2018best tradition of civil disobedience\u2019</strong></h2> <p>In a perfect world, Snowden could come home and tell his story to a jury, as many of his critics say he should. However, this belies a fundamental misunderstanding of the law Snowden is charged under. The Espionage Act \u2013 a first world war-era statute meant for spies, not whistleblowers who give information to the press \u2013 does not allow for a \u201cpublic interest\u201d defense. Snowden would literally not be allowed to tell the jury his motive for leaking the information, describe the benefits of the disclosures, or discuss their lack of harm to national security. <br></p> <p>The most famous whistleblower in American history, Daniel Ellsberg, has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/may/30/daniel-ellsberg-snowden-fair-trial-kerry-espionage-act\">made this point</a> repeatedly and is on the record as saying that Snowden was right to leave the country so he could continue to participate in the public debate around his disclosures. </p> <p><em>Edward Snowden sits on the board of directors at Freedom of the Press Foundation, where the author is executive director </em></p>",

  "<p>A couple of weeks ago, Taylor Mac spent the evening rehearsing a number from <a href=\"http://stannswarehouse.org/show/taylor-mac-24-decade-history-popular-music-1776-2016/\">A 24-Decade History of Popular Music </a>at St Ann\u2019s Warehouse in Brooklyn. An ecstatic and skeptical exploration of American song, Mac\u2019s project is divided into eight three-hour concerts that will eventually be scrunched together into one 24-hour cathexis. </p> <p>The number at hand was <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcSlcNfThUA\">Tiptoe Through the Tulips</a> and Mac was rehearsing an epic dance-off between 12 ukulele-strumming Charles Dickenses and 12 tapping <a href=\"http://www.biography.com/people/tiny-tim-251027\">Tiny Tims</a>. As none of the strummers or hoofers had been called to rehearsal, Mac was alone onstage. </p> <p>It didn\u2019t seem that way. Mac made the tinsel\u2013swagged platform feel crowded, hectic, delirious. A sometimes solo artist with titanic presence, outsized glamour, and coruscatingly queer sensibilities, Mac can fill a room as awesomely as the gods of the Homeric hymns, who would cast off their human disguise and suddenly soar to the ceiling. (He can display a god\u2019s cruelty, too. Especially if you\u2019re a patron with a bourgeois air and an aisle seat.)</p> <p>But offstage, bereft of eyeliner and trash-drag couture, Mac looks almost poignantly human with a bald head, sad eyes and a demure smile. Mac prefers the ambiguous gender pronoun judy,\u201d which is, Mac says, \u201cit\u2019s own performance art piece and it\u2019s own fun\u201d, but when dressed down he presents as male. There\u2019s something almost childlike about Mac and you can glimpse that queer kid from the California suburbs, who first found refuge in community theater and then in the wild club scene.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uwcbE2VAeeY\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/uwcbE2VAeeY?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>Mac\u2019s oeuvre includes pieces in which Mac has imagined the apocalypse, played a sentient flower, portrayed Mac\u2019s dead father\u2019s former pen pals. Mainstream culture is not exactly judy\u2019s thing, but for the past five years, Mac has <a href=\"https://www.poets.org/poetsorg/poem/i-hear-america-singing\">heard America singing</a>, then selected 246 songs that define the country from 1776 to the present, finally working with the pianist and arranger Matt Ray to adapt them for Mac\u2019s voice (a warm and unexpectedly hardy tenor) and for an orchestra that begins with 24 musicians and shrinks to just one. The producer Mark Russell, an early champion of Mac\u2019s, calls the result \u201ca magic act and a music act and a complete surprise at all times\u201d.</p> <p>Mac describes the show, performed by more than 200 people, as \u201ca radical fairy realness ritual\u201d. Like Mac\u2019s last piece, the more or less realistic <a href=\"http://www.taylormac.org/portfolio_page/hir/\">Hir</a>, A 24-Decade History isn\u2019t an outwardly political work. But the popular songs and the stories Mac swirls around them are designed to make American audiences face up to the nation\u2019s past, especially the parts of the past that we\u2019ve rejected, stifled, evaded. A 24-Decade History offers a return of the repressed. This time the repressed is wearing sequins and a hot-pink merkin.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s about we\u2019re all in this room together and we happen to have this history on our back,\u201d Mac says. \u201cHow do we deal with it?\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1ea41bb6366d8a1640222dea819fe951bbe141a7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1ea41bb6366d8a1640222dea819fe951bbe141a7/0_243_3600_2160/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Taylor Mac: finding the queerness in mainstream songs\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Taylor Mac: finding the queerness in mainstream songs.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nathan Keays</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Mac isn\u2019t sure. Each decade renews the question, offering standards such as <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZZJuqt2PGM\">Take Me Out to the Ballgame</a> and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLoYFvbR0XY\">Don\u2019t Fence Me In </a>as answers of a sort. Mac conjures a theme and a narrative spin for each decade and few songs are given straightforward performance. \u201cEvery single song has some kind of queer thing in it and every song doesn\u2019t,\u201d he says. </p> <p>Mac has a talent for finding the queerness inherent in mainstream songs, pointing out the innuendo in<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=StDpLge_ITM\"> Yankee Doodle Dandy</a>, for example. When the songs resist, Mac just goes ahead and queers them, as when he stages <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XZnpdomkKAg\">Ted Nugent\u2019s Snakeskin Cowboy</a> as a slow dance number at \u201ca junior high queer prom\u201d.</p> <p>Early inspiration for the piece lay in memories of an Aids walk that Mac attended in the pre-retroviral era. Mac, a suburban teen, watched men come together to celebrate themselves, their lovers, their family, their friends, even as so many were dying. That experience led Mac to explore, \u201chow communities build themselves because they\u2019re being torn apart\u201d, something that America has so often faced.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8e43f8d7a4bfc0f7a870d6d64d0e440781b91adf\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8e43f8d7a4bfc0f7a870d6d64d0e440781b91adf/0_0_2472_3708/667.jpg\" alt=\"The marathon is uproarious, upsetting, and at least a little kinky\" width=\"667\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The marathon is uproarious, upsetting, and at least a little kinky.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nooshig Varjabedian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Mac refuses to explore it alone.

I want people to be a little lost. I don\u2019t want them to feel like they\u2019re satisfied with their purchase.\u201d Unless your idea of a date is uproarious, upsetting, and at least a little kinky, \u201cIt shouldn\u2019t feel like date night.\u201d</p> <p>Mac enjoys making people uncomfortable and at a recent performance, Mac made joke after joke at the expense of the donors in the audience.

The songs are pure delight, the costumes extravagant bliss. Various concerts include puppets, burlesque dancers, a marching band, free root beer. As Lear deBessonet, a director who has often worked with Mac explained in an email, Mac uses fizzy drinks, a staggering stage presence and outsized glamour to disarm audiences, \u201cand in that state of being loosened up with pleasure, that\u2019s when he can pierce your heart\u201d, she wrote.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"85d1af3610674dd6757bdb1357cd20352f6141d7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/85d1af3610674dd6757bdb1357cd20352f6141d7/0_0_3823_5455/701.jpg\" alt=\"Outsized glamor and a staggering stage presence enable Mac to pierce the audience\u2019s hearts.\" width=\"701\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Outsized glamour and a staggering stage presence enable Mac to pierce the audience\u2019s hearts.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ves Pitts</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This injury is designed to provoke the audience into rebelling \u2013 against judy, against mainstream ideology, against American politics, but most of all against themselves. \u201cI just want people to rebel against the sense of who they are a little bit,\u201d Mac says.</p> <p>A lot of that rebellion will probably take place during the 24-hour marathon, an act of endurance, for performer and for audience, that Mac has never rehearsed and will never perform again. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t want to put myself or anyone else through that on a regular basis,\u201d he says. \u201cA 24-hour show, it\u2019s cruel.\u201d</p> <p>Mac doesn\u2019t know if his voice or his body will sustain him. \u201cI\u2019m supposed to fall apart, the audience is supposed to fall apart, the musicians fall apart as we go forward,\u201d Mac says.

Initially Mac planned to surreptitiously scarf almonds and sip smoothies during trumpet solos, but what happens, Mac learned, is that \u201cwhen I check out the audience checks out, so I can\u2019t ever check out.\u201d</p> <p>Mac also has learned that judy can\u2019t check out of America either. The show hasn\u2019t made Mac feel more patriotic (he has a costume riffing on the American flag, that costume is assless) or less angry. If he\u2019s pleased that the country has finally had the decency to acknowledge the basic human rights of queers, women, minorities, etc, he\u2019s appalled at how long it has taken. Still it\u2019s helped Mac to claw back some sense of pride in the country\u2019s pluralism. </p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s not a default of America that is bland and conservative and straight and white,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m saying this is what America is too.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Scotland Yard is urging the home secretary, Amber Rudd, to intervene in the case of woman from Sierra Leone who carries out female genital mutilation and is said to be seeking entry into the UK.</p> <p>The Metropolitan police applied to the high court for a female genital mutilation protection order and a further order to prevent the woman from entering the UK.</p> <p>Mr Justice Holman, however, sitting in London, said the question of whether the woman could enter the country was a matter for the secretary of state, not the court.</p> <p>The woman, who was not named in court, is understood to be Kharday Zorokong, who was part of a Sierra Leonean delegation that included the minister for gender, Dr Sylvia Blyden, to the 73rd session of the UN committee on the rights of the child in Geneva last week. Zorokong performs FGM, but is opposed to operations on children under 18. Campaigners feared that she would come to the UK as part of Blyden\u2019s delegation after the meeting in Geneva.</p> <p>Zimran Samuel, appearing for the police, said a campaigner in her 40s who was also an FGM survivorhad asked officers to take action to ban the practitioner.</p> <p>Samuel did not name the cutter but said she had a \u201chigh-profile status\u201d as the head of a council of practitioners in her community. Because of her status, people in the UK would want to use her services, even although it is illegal here, he said.</p> <p>Samuel later said that he was concerned that there was a loophole in the law set up to protect women and girls against FGM, which allows for the protection of named individuals, but did not provide protection in a case such as this. He told the judge that a request to the home secretary to be stop Zorokong from entering the UK was in motion.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>The judge said he found FGM \u201cabhorrent and a terrible scourge on women\u201d, but \u201cthe right thing is to try to get the secretary of state not to let this woman in\u201d.</p> <p>After the judge declined to make any orders, the Met said in a statement: \u201cThe MPS is now considering what other options are available to prevent the entry into the UK of a person who may wish to carry out FGM.\u201d</p> <p>DS Wendy Morgan, from the Met\u2019s sexual offences, exploitation and child abuse command, said: \u201cFGM is illegal and constitutes child abuse. A lot of work has been done to raise awareness over the last few years of this horrific practice, highlighting the short- and long-term health risks and the absence of any religious teaching that supports it. However, we are not complacent and more still needs to be done.</p> <p>\u201cThe Met spends time highlighting the support available to those who may be at risk. When victims come to us with concerns over the risks they face, no matter what stage they are at in their life, the Met takes take these concerns very seriously.</p> <p>\u201cPolice have a responsibility to act to protect vulnerable people and prevent people, especially the vulnerable, from becoming victims of crime. The Met will always to seek to follow the law to carry out this responsibility.\u201d</p> <p>A Home Office spokesperson said: \u201cAn individual can be excluded on the grounds that their presence is \u2018not conducive to the public good\u2019 if it is reasonable, consistent and proportionate based on the evidence available.\u201d</p> <p>Before the Ebola outbreak forced a temporary ban on the practice, it was estimated that 88% of Sierra Leonean girls were cut, the seventh highest rate of the 28 countries in which FGM is practised.</p> <p>FGM is not illegal in Sierra Leone, but ministers have proposed outlawing the practice among under-18s. <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/aug/24/sierra-leone-female-genital-mutilation-soweis-secret-societies-fear\">Many anti-FGM campaigners in the country say the move would have little impact</a>, because it is traditionally the parents who make the decision for a daughter, irrespective of age. </p> <p>Nimko Ali, an anti-FGM campaigner and founder of Daughters of Eve, said she welcomed the judge\u2019s comment and was hopeful that Rudd would take action. She said that practitioners in Sierra Leone had a powerful role and political influence in the country.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Ali said: \u201cI\u2019m hopeful that this will be successful.

The sense of impunity with which this woman can sit on the UN and say that FGM is an act of consent. If she were to visit the UK it would be a propaganda mission.\u201d</p> <p>Anti-FGM campaigners from Sierra Leone have condemned Zorokong\u2019s appearance before the UN. At the meeting, Blyden spoke about protecting under-18s from FGM, but insisted that adult women should be allowed to \u201cdo what she wants to her body\u201d, ignoring the pressure on women to undergo mutilation.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Yasmin Jusu-Sheriff, part of the Not In My Name coalition with Equality Now, said it was inappropriate that Zorokong was present at the UN last week.</p> <p>The first ever recorded figures for FGM, <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/newsbeat/article/36838870/the-first-ever-fgm-figures-show-nearly-6000-new-cases-in-england\">reported in July</a>, showed that between April 2015 and March 2016 there were 5,702 new cases among women in England.

It isn\u2019t a response to actuarial reality,\u201d said Matthew Miller, a Northeastern University and Harvard School of Public Health professor and one of the authors of the study. </p> <p>The data suggests that American gun ownership is driven by an \u201cincreasing fearfulness\u201d, said Dr Deborah Azrael, a Harvard School of Public Health firearms researcher and the lead author of the study. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/16/guns-what-made-you-change-your-mind-america\">What made you change your mind about guns?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cIf we hope to reduce firearm suicide, if we hope to reduce the other potential dangers of guns, my gut is, we have to speak to that fear,\u201d she said.</p> <p>The new survey also found a much higher estimate of annual gun thefts: 400,000 guns stolen per year, compared with 230,000 a year in a recent estimate from the National Crime Victimization Survey.</p> <p>Phil Cook, a Duke University firearms researcher and one of the authors of a prominent 1994 study of American gun ownership, praised the new research as \u201ca very high-quality survey\u201d.</p> <p>Unlike the more frequent gun ownership polls from Pew or the General Social Survey, \u201cit goes beyond asking whether there\u2019s a firearm in their household and asks how many firearms are in the household\u201d, he said. \u201cWithout knowing the answer to the second question, it\u2019s not possible to get a estimate of the total stock of firearms in the US.\u201d</p> <p>He noted, however, that \u201ctheir estimate of the national total is lower than some would expect.

Bryce Towsley, a Vermont-based gun writer and the author of Prepper Guns, a firearms guide for survivalists, said he worried about how the survey would be used politically.</p> <p>\u201cThey\u2019re going to say, \u2018Okay, there\u2019s a small minority of people who have all the guns \u2013 we\u2019re going to go after them.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>But Azrael\u2019s immediate reaction to the survey results, she said, was not to focus on the gun owners with dozens of weapons, but on the nearly 50% of gun owners who had just one or two. \u201cTo change their behavior with respect to guns, and the ways in which they store them, or their decision-making \u2013 we could have a really big impact on suicide,\u201d she said. </p> <p>Roughly 20,000 of America\u2019s more than 30,000 annual gun deaths are suicides. </p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know anybody who thinks or talks seriously about confiscating guns,\u201d she said. \u201cFrom a public health perspective \u2013 you don\u2019t seize cigarettes.\u201d But, she said, \u201cyou do try to make good science available.

Since a previous in-depth national phone survey in 1994, the percentage of Americans who say they own guns has fallen slightly, from 25% to 22%. The drop was driven by a dramatic decrease among men. The 1994 survey found that 42% of American men described themselves as gun owners, compared with only 32% of American men in the new study.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--supporting\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2016/08/gun-owners-male-female/\" data-alt=\"Decrease in gun ownership driven by males\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2016/08/gun-owners-male-female/\">Decrease in gun ownership driven by males</a> <figcaption>Decrease in gun ownership driven by males</figcaption> </figure>  <p>The percentage of women who say they own guns has increased slightly from 9% in a 1994 survey to 12% today, but researchers said the increase was not meaningful. Since the 1980s, female gun ownership has fluctuated between 9% and 14% in annual surveys. </p> <p>Women tend to be more supportive of gun control laws than men, and gun control advocates have focused on women, particularly <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/26/black-lives-matter-mothers-democratic-convention-hillary-clinton\">mothers</a>, as a key voting bloc to push forward what they call a \u201cgun sense\u201d agenda. Earlier this year, Everytown for Gun Safety, the country\u2019s largest gun control group, launched a new campaign focused on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/feb/18/gun-control-young-women-us-college-university-gunsplainers\">educating single women </a>about the need for new gun laws.<br></p> <p>But the new survey provides support for the National Rifle Association\u2019s assertion that the total number of female gun owners has grown in recent years, even if the percentage of women owning guns has not increased substantially. The findings also show that the gender gap in gun ownership is closing, with American women making up a larger proportion of gun owners as male gun ownership declines.</p> <p>The number of women who enroll each year in the NRA\u2019s basic pistol course almost doubled from 2011 to 2014, from about 25,000 a year to nearly 46,000 a year, according to NRA spokeswoman Catherine Mortensen.</p> <p></p> <p> </p> <h2>Demographics</h2> <p>Overall, the survey found, gun owners tended to be white, male, conservative, and live in rural areas. Thirty per cent of conservatives said they were gun owners, compared with 19% of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jan/05/hillary-clinton-nra-gun-control\">moderates</a> and only 14% of liberals. The strongest predictor of gun ownership was military service. 44% of veterans said they owned a firearm. </p> <p>Clear racial disparities in overall gun ownership remained, with 25% of white and multi-racial Americans saying they personally owned a gun, compared with 16% of Hispanics and 14% of African Americans.</p> <p>But there was essentially no disparity in gun ownership based on income level for Americans who make between $25,000 and more than $100,000 a year. Americans who made less than $25,000 a year were less likely to own guns.</p> <p>The survey found that Americans who only owned handguns were much more diverse than gun owners who owned a mix of handguns and long guns, or those who only owned rifles and shotguns. Those in the \u201chandguns only\u201d group were more likely to be female, non-white, and live in a urban area, and less likely to have grown up in a house with a gun.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2016/08/gun-owner-heatmap/\" data-alt=\"Demographic characteristics of gun owners\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2016/08/gun-owner-heatmap/\">Demographic characteristics of gun owners</a> <figcaption>Demographic characteristics of gun owners</figcaption> </figure>  <p>Roughly 44% of black gun owners and 37% of Hispanic gun owners said they only owned handguns, compared with 21% of non-Hispanic whites.</p> <p>Cook, the Duke firearms researcher, said the demographic data on handgun-only owners was one of the most interesting findings of the study. But he said it was \u201ckind of worrying\u201d that women who had no previous experience with guns were buying handguns for self-defense, and that he was concerned \u201cthat puts them at greater risk\u201d for gun accidents or thefts.</p> <p>The demographics of America\u2019s 7.7 million gun super-owners were less diverse than gun owners overall, with super-owners more likely to be male, less likely to be black or Hispanic, and more likely to own a gun for protection, researchers said. This subset of gun enthusiasts \u2013 only 14% of all gun owners \u2013 has amassed a collective 133m firearms.</p> <p>Interviews with Americans who own at least 17 firearms revealed a wide range of reasons for accumulating so many guns. </p> <p>Some super-owners are dedicated collectors with special rooms to display their assortment of historic firearms. Others are firearms instructors, gunsmiths, or competitive shooters, who need a variety of firearms in the course of work or competition. Some gun owners have a survivalist streak, and believe in storing up weapons, as well as food and water, in case of a disaster scenario. Others simply picked up a handgun here, a shotgun or hunting rifle there, and somehow ended up with dozens. </p> <p>\u201cWhy do you need more than one pair of shoes?\u201d said Philip van Cleave, the president of the Virginia Citizens Defense League, a gun rights group that views itself as being to the political right of the NRA. \u201cThe truth is, you don\u2019t, but do you want more than one pair of shoes? If you going hiking, you don\u2019t want to use that one pair of high heels.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWalking around the beach with shirt off and shorts \u2026 I\u2019m probably going to use a different gun than putting on a sport coat and going out to dinner,\u201d he said. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed element--supporting\" data-alt=\"Membership ask\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;html&gt;

Many gun rights advocates are fiercely private about gun ownership. </p> <p>After Sandy Hook, when a local newspaper in New York state published an interactive map with the names and addresses of gun permit owners \u2013 a matter of public record \u2013 gun owners reacted with outrage, reporters and editors received threats, and the paper reportedly hired armed security guards in response. New York state swiftly passed a law protecting the privacy of gun permit holders. Two other local papers in North Carolina and Maine were later inundated with threats after merely requesting public records of gun ownership, though they said they were not planning to publish the names of individual owners. Both papers dropped their requests, and the editor of one of the papers resigned.</p> <p>The Harvard/Northeastern study is based on a survey of nearly 4,000 Americans conducted online in 2015 by a market research company, GfK, with a nationally representative <a href=\"http://join.knpanel.com/\">panel of opt-in participants</a> who are compensated to complete surveys on a variety of issues.</p> <p>Van Cleave, the president of the Virginia Citizen\u2019s Defense League, said he was very skeptical of the accuracy of phone surveys of gun ownership, since he believes many gun owners might not feel comfortable telling a stranger on the phone whether they are a gun owner or how many guns they own. He said his \u201cgut feeling\u201d was that gun owners might be a little more comfortable answering questions honestly in an anonymous online survey.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"5ae2224fcd50b32c0cc14916fbab86024a67cacc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5ae2224fcd50b32c0cc14916fbab86024a67cacc/0_20_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Gun enthusiasts look over Smith &amp; Wesson pistols at the NRA Annual Meetings &amp; Exhibits in May.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Gun enthusiasts look over Smith &amp; Wesson pistols at the NRA Annual Meetings &amp; Exhibits in May.

It felt that we were talking about a regular consumer product.\u201d</p> <p>The new survey results mirror the trends of the annual General Social Survey, which found that household gun ownership has fallen from 50% to close to 31% since the late 1970s, and that individual gun ownership fell from 28% in 1980 to 22% in 2014. </p> <p>But as with most aspects of American gun politics, the basic data on American gun ownership is hotly debated, with some gun rights supporters arguing that American gun ownership is not on the decline, and that Americans may be under-reporting their gun ownership in some surveys.</p> <p>A <a href=\"http://www.gallup.com/poll/1645/guns.aspx\">Gallup poll</a> last year estimated personal gun ownership at 28%, while a <a href=\"http://www.people-press.org/2016/08/26/opinions-on-gun-policy-and-the-2016-campaign/\">Pew Research Center</a> survey put it at 31%, which would make the estimated total of American gun owners more than 75 million, compared with 55 million in the Harvard/Northeastern study.</p> <p></p> <p>The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms tracks the numbers of firearms manufactured in or imported into the United States, as well as how many background checks on gun sales licensed firearm dealers process. </p> <p>Manufacturing and import records suggest that more than 360m firearms entered the US market between 1899 and 2013, the new study\u2019s authors noted. With gun sales spiking since 2013, some estimates would put the total number of American firearms today around 400m. </p> <p>However, it\u2019s not clear how many American guns have been broken, confiscated and destroyed by the police, smuggled out of the country, or otherwise left the gun stock over the decades. </p> <p>The full results of the Harvard/Northeastern gun ownership study are undergoing peer review and are slated to be published in the autumn of 2017 by the Russell Sage Foundation. While the full peer review is not complete, Azrael said, the current results have gone through an initial round of comments and revisions from a group of leading firearms researchers. </p> <p>The National Rifle Association did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the initial findings of the survey. </p> <p>Mike Bazinet, a spokesman for the National Shooting Sports Foundation, the firearm industry\u2019s trade association, said he would have to defer full comment until he could read the entire survey and its methodology. </p> <p>But he questioned why some results of the survey were being released before the full paper was published, and said some of the results sounded implausible. </p> <p>\u201cReally? Three per cent of American gun owners own half the guns? That seems wildly off the mark. On the surface, this survey sounds like part of the ongoing effort to minimize gun ownership to make more gun control seem politically achievable,\u201d he wrote in an e-mail. </p> <p>But Gary Kleck, a Florida State University criminologist and firearms researcher, said the concentration of most guns in the hands of a relatively small proportion of gun owners was \u201cold news\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s probably true for just about any consumer good,\u201d he said. </p> <ul> <li>Support the Guardian\u2019s independent journalism by <a href=\"https://contribute.theguardian.com/home?INTCMP=co_us_article_lois_footer\">making a contribution</a> or <a href=\"https://membership.theguardian.com/us/supporter?INTCMP=co_us_article_lois_footer\">becoming a member</a></li> </ul>",

Yet what we do know is that we now inhabit an age in which it\u2019s logistically straightforward to commit attacks designed to kill and create mayhem, and there are clear ideological rationales for doing so. This toxic combination, along with an occasional willingness to die while carrying out the \u201coperation\u201d, makes this new foe \u2013 call him a terrorist or a disturbed individual \u2013 particularly difficult to thwart. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/19/new-york-and-new-jersey-explosive-devices-what-we-know\">New York and New Jersey explosive devices: what we know</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It used to take some degree of preparation to carry off a successful attack, especially in the west. The fact that some bombs in New Jersey and one in Manhattan failed to explode is a reminder that building explosives takes some degree of skill if you\u2019re to be successful. Also, convincing your radical comrades to engage in a conspiracy opens you up to penetration by the cops or intelligence services. That is an additional challenge.</p> <p>But stabbing people in a mall or shooting people in a club requires little preparation. You don\u2019t need any particular specialized training anymore except to pull a trigger, drive a car, be willing to kill and desire to be killed. </p> <p>We\u2019ve seen this DIY violence elsewhere. For example, the atrocity in Nice, France, killed <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-france-crash-minister-idUSKCN0ZV0BK?il=0\">over 80</a> people, and while multiple suspects were arrested following the attack only one person carried out the operation. In this instance the assailant, Mohamed Lahouaiej-Bouhlel, drove a large truck into a crowd, crushing scores of people. The carnage only stopped after police shot him dead. </p> <p>Soft, crowded targets are plentiful in our free, open societies. There is little the authorities can do to keep a determined attacker from striking pedestrians enjoying a balmy Saturday night in New York City. Guns, gates and guards can only provide so much protection against a wily, creative adversary who is willing to risk oblivion. </p> <p>What makes confronting these DIY terrorists even more difficult is that there\u2019s an organization actively and successfully disseminating a death-cult message: the Islamic State. Through its slick social media messaging and global network of personal connections, this organization has been convincing the misguided \u2013 some of whom are lone wolves \u2013 to cause havoc in their home countries. This is no accident, but a long-held plan; terror operations outside Iraq and Syria have and will always be <a href=\"http://thecipherbrief.com/article/middle-east/dna-isis\">part and parcel</a> of the Islamic State\u2019s DNA.</p> <p>For those who wanted to kill people more generally for their own reasons, Islamic State provides them a rationale by which to do so. For example, the San Bernardino killer Syed Rizwan Farook bought his weapons <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2015/10/03/us/how-mass-shooters-got-their-guns.html?_r=0\">years before</a> he killed 14 people at a holiday party. Why didn\u2019t he commit his crime earlier? We won\u2019t ever know, since he (along with his wife, Tashfeen Malik) is dead, but perhaps Islamic State appears to have given him a reason and a mission to finally take the plunge and destroy himself.</p> <p>As long as Islamic State steadfastly pursues its \u201cvictory\u201d narrative, so long as it survives in one physical form or another, people will use its existence as a warped rationale for murderous behavior. Destroying Islamic State and draining the swamp will go a long way to denting the ideological allure of attacking civilians. </p> <p>At the time of writing, we still don\u2019t quite know the motivations of the NYC bomber or the Minnesota stabber. But we do know that if they were motivated by a jihadist ideology, crushing Islamic State will go a long way to reducing the rationale for this kind of behavior, making our streets safer.</p> <p>This will require sacrifice and great political capital to see it through to the end. Islamic State is fully committed to this conflict, will give no quarter, and will continue to use its power to cause havoc on our streets. </p> <p>Western nations must be committed to defeating Isis. In the meantime, our societies must be resilient enough to absorb \u201cinspired\u201d or \u201cdirected\u201d attacks from the Islamic state and its DIY acolytes for the foreseeable future. <br></p>",

Helena Smith reports from Athens:</p> <blockquote> <p>With its popularity plummeting in the polls, Greece\u2019s leftist-led government is keen to use the resumption of talks with lenders to good effect. Long and short, that means debt relief and putting discussion of it on the table. To get there Athens needs to complete the current round of prior actions, or milestone reforms, it failed to deal with over the summer. Upon them not only rests the next installment of bailout aid \u2013 at \u20ac2.8bn critical for the debt-wracked economy - but the onset of official debate over what to do about Greece\u2019s unsustainable debt load, at 180% of national output by far the highest in the eurozone. \u201cThe idea is to push the multi-bill with all these measures through parliament this week,\u201d said one well-placed source.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a1822cf2e6697073542e66e07f00d9f40fcc2e5f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a1822cf2e6697073542e66e07f00d9f40fcc2e5f/0_133_3979_2388/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Greece\u2019s prime minister Alexis Tsipras at last wek\u2019s informal EU summit in Bratislava.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Greece\u2019s prime minister Alexis Tsipras at last wek\u2019s informal EU summit in Bratislava.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: STRINGER/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <blockquote> <p>Among the measures will be the appointment of a supervisory board for the country\u2019s new privatisation fund - an issue Athens has rowed about vociferously with creditors \u2013 and the formal inclusion of several loss-making public entities in the body. </p> <p>With Greece\u2019s debt-repayment timetable far from pressing, creditors - though peaved with the slow pace of reforms - are not piling on the pressure. Instead it is the government, that feeling the pinch of public hostility, is now keen to move on to the next step of passing the reforms so the Euro Working Group can agree to disburse the aid when it next meets on September 29. If that goal is achieved, the hope is the next bailout review will begin on October 17 \u2013 and with it the much anticipated issue of debt forgiveness. </p> <p>Addressing his Syriza party\u2019s central committee over the weekend, prime minister Alexis Tsipras insisted \u201cthere will be developments on the debt issue soon.\u201d</p> </blockquote> <p><em>On that note, it\u2019s time to close for the evening.

The mistake, the chancellor said, was that she and her government had not been quicker to prepare for the mass movement of people triggered by conflicts in the Middle East. </p> <p>\u201cIf I was able to, I would turn back time by many, many years, so that I could have prepared the whole government and the authorities for the situation which hit us out of the blue in the late summer of 2015,\u201d she said.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/18/angela-merkels-party-suffers-slump-in-berlin-election\"> Sunday\u2019s election</a> ushered in a new era of multi-party politics for the German capital, with the two governing establishment parties, the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) and the Social Democratic party (SPD) plummeting to the worst Berlin result in their parties\u2019 histories, while the leftwing Die Linke and anti-immigrant Alternative f\u00fcr Deutschland (AfD) enjoyed impressive gains.</p> <p>On Monday, Merkel admitted she had failed to sufficiently explain her refugee policy, and that her phrase \u201c<em tabindex=\"-1\">Wir schaffen das\u201d </em>(\u201cWe will manage\u201d) had provoked some of those who did not agree with her political course. Her words will be interpreted as an olive branch to the leader of her CDU\u2019s sister party, the Bavarian Christian Social Union (CSU), who has repeatedly called on her to distance herself from the much-cited slogan.</p> <p>For too long, Merkel said, she had relied on procedure according to the Dublin resolution, \u201cwhich, to put it simply, had taken the problem off Germany\u2019s hands\u201d, adding: \u201cAnd that was not good.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b56b8d2837d6cfe2161c9570cd7c597e32a23a18\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b56b8d2837d6cfe2161c9570cd7c597e32a23a18/0_4_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Georg Pazderski, the Berlin leader of Alternative f\u00fcr Deutschland\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Georg Pazderski, the Berlin leader of Alternative f\u00fcr Deutschland.

Banning people from entering the country on the basis of their religion, she said, would be incompatible with Germany\u2019s constitution and her own party\u2019s \u201cethical foundations\u201d.</p> <p>She lamented that the European Union as a whole was failing to recognise the refugee crisis as \u201ca global and a moral challenge\u201d. \u201cWhat we are seeing in Europe is a realisation that we are no longer leading the field when it comes to globalisation, we are not setting the pace.</p> <p>\u201cIn 1990, when the wall fell, the cold war came to an end and freedom blossomed everywhere; it looked like we were on an irreversible road to victory, and that it was just up to the rest of the world to join our model. Freedom had won. It now turns out things aren\u2019t that simple\u201d.</p> <p>Sunday\u2019s result served to illustrate the extent to which party political landscapes across Europe are becoming ever more fractured.

  "<p>The day before Pako Ayestar\u00e1n flew to Singapore to meet the Valencia owner Peter Lim and discuss becoming the manager at Mestalla, he phoned Gary Neville to ask for his blessing. Neville was the one who had taken him there in the first place, after all, the man who had publicly insisted \u201cwhen I go, Pako goes\u201d, and now Ayesteran was about to take his job. It was an \u201cawkward\u201d phone call but, if the Englishman wasn\u2019t entirely pleased, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/may/07/pako-ayestaran-gary-neville-valencia-best-man-job\">he told Ayestar\u00e1n to go for it</a>. He also told Lim that his former assistant was the best man for the job. At the time, the new manager was grateful. He might not be so sure now. They might not be, either.</p> <p>Six months on, Valencia are bottom of the table, the only side without a single point. On the eve of their opening game of the new season Ayestar\u00e1n promised \u201cwe\u2019re going to enjoy it\u201d \u2013 but no one is enjoying this. Four games later, they\u2019re the worst team in Spain, and he\u2019s the worst manager in their history. That\u2019s what the statistics say, anyway. Mario Kempes, meanwhile, says this: \u201cWhat\u2019s happening to Valencia is very worrying; there\u2019s no project, no ideas, just pure footballing impotence.\u201d Which would be bad enough anyway but Kempes isn\u2019t just arguably Valencia\u2019s best player ever; he\u2019s also their ambassador.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/18/la-liga-real-madrid-espanyol-james-rodriguez\">La Liga round-up: Real Madrid break club record with win over Espanyol</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Kempes represents the club, or is supposed to. If what he said was telling, the fact that he said it was even more so: a portrait of the way things sometimes are at a club where Neville admits feeling people greeting him with looks that said \u201cyou won\u2019t be here for long\u201d; where, if they did, they were right. On Sunday night Kempes backed the coach \u2026 and then made a pitch for his job. It is one he thinks might become available again soon, and he is not alone.</p> <p>Ayestar\u00e1n is under pressure for sure. Over the last seven seasons, Valencia\u2019s position after four games reads: sixth, third, third, first, sixth, second, second. This time, they\u2019re 20th, bottom of the pile. Played four, lost four, conceded 10. It is the joint-worst start in their history. The last three teams to start like this \u2013 Osasuna, Sporting and X\u00e9rez \u2013 all went down. Away at Athletic Bilbao is never easy but this time it was set up as the game they had to win; a \u201cfinal\u201d already, with 34 games still to go. As one paper put it, they were obliged to wipe out that zero by their name. They didn\u2019t: two goals from Aritz Aduriz saw them defeated 2-1 at San Mam\u00e9s.</p> <p>This is Valencia\u2019s joint-worst start ever yet, oddly, despite the results it hasn\u2019t all been bad. Not <em>that</em> bad, anyway.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s hard to know what\u2019s missing,\u201d goalkeeper Diego Alves said on Sunday. \u201cIn every game we have shown that we have the qualities to win, but we have no points,\u201d Mario Su\u00e1rez noted. Luck always feels like a desperately weak explanation for anything but it plays its part. Las Palmas coach Quique Seti\u00e9n admitted that Valencia deserved more when his side beat them 4-2 on the opening night; the week after they should have been four or five up by half-time against Eibar, but lost 1-0 to a Pedro Len penalty; and the week after that they came from 2-0 down to equalise against Betis, and could have won it before conceding a late goal. On Sunday, they went a goal ahead inside three minutes.</p> <p>Yet again, though, Valencia were fragile; defensively they have been appalling, mentally they appear weak, belief slipping away. Mistakes are damaging them; more of them individual than systemic. Opponents find space too easily. It doesn\u2019t take much to create chances against them. They do not compete: \u201cEven their milk teeth haven\u2019t come through yet,\u201d as Cayetano Ros put it. Centre-backs Ezequiel Garay and Eliaquim Mangala arrived on the final day of the transfer window but they have not yet remedied their ills \u2013 Garay was injured on Sunday, while Aduriz destroyed Mangala. There is little real control in the middle, and up front they miss chances. Against Athletic it was just the one, but it was a clear one.</p> <p>And so here they are; here the manager is, under pressure. It is not just this season, either. Valencia lost the last three games of last season too. Seven consecutive defeats is their worst ever run. Over the last eight games, Valencia\u2019s record reads: lost seven, drawn one \u2013 their last win was back in April. It is not just the results that matter but the reaction they provoke; the instability is inescapable. That filters into the dressing room; Mestalla is treated as transient by many of them. There is something about the culture, the structure, that Neville believed was not conducive to sustainable success. Not yet, at least. The manager, certainly, is at risk of becoming a passing presence \u2013 and accepted as such, a short-term solution that is increasingly not a solution at all.</p> <p>Kempes said that the manager should be supported, but then <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ESPNMarioKempes/status/777586954024148992?lang=en\">he tweeted</a>: \u201cTo all those asking: I\u2019d do it with all my desire if they asked me to.\u201d Soon, Ossie Ardiles <a href=\"https://twitter.com/osvaldooardiles/status/777607107394887681\">was offering himself as assistant</a>: \u201cI\u2019ll go with you,\u201d he wrote. The former striker Fernando Morientes called Kempes\u2019s words \u201cunethical\u201d. Meanwhile, over at Super Deporte, they were running a poll. Was it necessary to sack Ayestar\u00e1n? Not desirable, <em>necessary;</em> 90% said yes. \u201cPaKO,\u201d they called him. Valencia are looking at alternatives, reports say. Whether it\u2019s actually an alternative is another matter. \u201cIt\u2019s not about the manager,\u201d the former goalkeeper Santiago Ca\u00f1izares insists. \u201cThe situation disgusts me,\u201d says the former captain David Albelda.</p> <p>Valencia have had eight managers since Unai Emery departed in the summer of 2012 season. Since Lim took over in October 2014, they have had Pizzi, Nuno and Voro (as caretaker), then Neville \u2013 whose arrival was presented, damagingly, more as a favour to a friend than the arrival of the ideal coach \u2013 and then Ayestar\u00e1n. Under him, Valencia have picked up 10 points from a possible 36; under Neville, the man he replaced, and the man who replaced Nuno, they picked up 14 from 48. That\u2019s 0.29 points a game under Neville, 0.27 under Ayestar\u00e1n. So much for his sacking solving things; so much for any sacking doing so. With each of the last three managers things have got worse, Valencia are becoming the old lady who swallowed a fly.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7e5daae1d83b70c57b1a844971483ec6eccbd506\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7e5daae1d83b70c57b1a844971483ec6eccbd506/0_0_4096_2393/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Athletic players celebrate going 2-1 up against Valencia at San Mames.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"584\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Athletic players celebrate going 2-1 up against Valencia at San Mames.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Luis Tejido/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Like his predecessors, Ayestar\u00e1n works with what he has been given and within an environment not entirely of his own making. \u201cI didn\u2019t say I was happy with the squad,\u201d he pointed out last week. This summer Valencia\u2019s best player departed early. Their captain and top-scorer left a few days after the president said he wouldn\u2019t. The centre-back who was not for sale got sold. The centre-backs who were for sale didn\u2019t. They tried to get rid of their goalkeeper but couldn\u2019t \u2013 now he\u2019s first choice again. Their former captain said he wanted to go too, but they wouldn\u2019t let him. He was isolated until he apologised. Garay and Mangala arrived \u2013 two more Mendes men to replace the last two, who failed. And the starting centre-backs in the B team couldn\u2019t be temporarily called up to the first team because they are over 23.</p> <p>And yet, take a step back and the summer business actually does not look bad. Financial regulations forced them to sell and they sold pretty well; over \u20ac100m was raised and they managed to get rid of some players they saw as problematic. On the face of it, the squad is reasonably strong; there are good players there. The football has not always been bad, even if the defending has. It doesn\u2019t look good, no \u2013 this is a team that should aspire to a Champions League place and it\u2019s bottom of La Liga instead, one whose results have been poor going back five months now, and where the explanations don\u2019t always convince \u2013 but then the last time they began with four defeats they finished third and reached the Champions League final.</p> <p>After Sunday\u2019s defeat the first question was direct: \u201cAre you capable of turning this around?\u201d Ayestar\u00e1n\u2019s lips moved but no words came out until the man sitting next to him flicked the switch. The microphone was on now, so Ayestar\u00e1n repeated himself. \u201cTotally,\u201d he said. \u201cBoth me and the players.\u201d</p> <h2>Talking points</h2> <p>\u2022 Legan\u00e9s\u2019s posters advertising the visit of Barcelona on Saturday ran with the slogan: \u201cLet God decide\u201d. Below was a picture of Leo Messi. God \u2013 <em>Dios</em> - was spelt with a 10 in it: <em>d10s</em>. And \u201cGod\u201d did decide too. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/17/leganes-barcelona-la-liga-match-report\">Well, him and Luis Su\u00e1rez and Neymar anyway</a>. \u201cWe weren\u2019t that interested in possession,\u201d Luis Enrique admitted as Legan\u00e9s pressed high, making life difficult for a team with Ivan Rakitic in deep midfield and a three-and-four-man defence (three in attack, four when attacked) in which Javier Mascherano was uncomfortable on the right; what they were interested in was releasing the front three \u2026 and they did the rest. Rafinha scored too: and it was a beauty.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3496e7575035de1fd453702491d767c671a8acca\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3496e7575035de1fd453702491d767c671a8acca/0_0_2008_1339/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Lionel Messi leading Legan\u00e9s a merry dance.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lionel Messi leading Legan\u00e9s a merry dance.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Pedro Armestre/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u2022 Not as much of a beauty as Nicola Sansone for Villarreal, mind you: from 52 metres away.

This is credit negative but manageable. And other critical factors such as capital and liquidity, which are largely determined by global standards, are unlikely to face material changes due to Brexit per se.\u201d</p> <p>Moody\u2019s said it thought it unlikely that all permissions granted to financial firms would be lost. Even without a formal arrangement, EU law already provides for limited recognition of non-EU regulatory regimes for the purpose of undertaking investment and banking business, it said.</p> <p>Simon Ainsworth, the senior vice-president at Moody\u2019s, said a scheme to harmonise regulations across the EU could provide an alternative way to access the single market.</p> <p>\u201cThe complexity of (quickly) unwinding the status quo and a desire to minimise the initial impact on European domiciled banks will likely lead to the preservation of most cross-border rights to undertake business,\u201d said Ainsworth.</p> <p>Moody\u2019s added that there would be less certainty for firms as access would depend on a judgment by the European commission, which might take time to make and could be withdrawn later.</p> <p>Ainsworth said: \u201cWhile banks that use the UK as an entry point for most EU operations should not suffer materially altered credit fundamentals if they lost their EU passports, the uncertainty around the outcome of any new arrangements mean that it is likely that some banks may choose to move some UK-based activities to the EU before the UK\u2019s withdrawal negotiations are complete.\u201d<br></p> <p>Mark Boleat, the policy chairman at the City of London Corporation, said: \u201cPassporting is still a crucial issue for financial services firms and the uncertainty is causing real problems for some businesses. What exactly its loss would be depends on both the sector and business model of any company.</p> <p>\u201cIn the City many firms are still analysing what impact the loss of passporting will have on them. For some retail banks it is of almost no real importance. But for the whole of international investment banking and an institution such as Lloyds of London it is an absolute necessity. We are making this point clear to policymakers in our ongoing discussions.\u201d</p> <p>Weidmann said the \u201chard Brexit\u201d option would lead to banks being automatically stripped of their ability to conduct business across the EU and open the door for Frankfurt to take business away from London.</p> <p>He emphasised that banking \u201cpassporting rights are tied to the single market and would automatically cease to apply if Great Britain is no longer at least part of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/oct/28/the-norway-option-what-is-it-and-what-does-it-mean-for-britain\">the EEA</a>\u201d .<br></p>",
  "<p>In my last week of using drugs in the summer of 2005, I had a moment of clarity during a binge that combined codeine cough syrup, Ativan pills and ground-up Oxycontin that I was snorting. I was stumbling around the room \u2013 I was always a mess of bruises from head to foot in those days \u2013 trying to decide whether or not to take all the rest of the Ativan in the bottle when it occurred to me to ask myself, \u201cWhy is it that I can never get high enough?

The tangled mess of fears, doubts and regrets, stinging failures and squandered possibilities I was always trying to stay one step ahead of was actually me \u2013 and the oblivion I was after was essentially a dress rehearsal for death.</p> <p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s deep,\u201d I thought, then inhaled another line of powdered \u201chillbilly heroin\u201d. I got drunk and high with the urgency of someone trying to put out a kitchen grease fire. </p> <p>I tried, and failed, again and again at trying to moderate my intake of intoxicating substances on my own. I would say I was just going to have a couple of drinks, swallow two Valium, what could that hurt? And then, within a matter of days or weeks, it was on again. I was careening numbly and dumbly through life, breaking everything I collided with.</p> <p>I tried exercise and therapy and veganism and acupuncture and yoga and meditation, but ultimately the hunger for total numbness and oblivion always came back, even after months of clean time. Finally, I opted for total sobriety. Though there are increasingly people who say that \u201cnormal substance use\u201d is the goal we should be working towards, I think that\u2019s just not an option. </p> <p>And it appears the science bears me out. <a href=\"http://psychcentral.com/news/2016/09/15/quitting-alcohol-may-be-easier-than-cutting-back/109896.html\">Recent research out of Sweden</a> has shown that people trying to recover and rebuild after the life-hurricane that is alcohol addiction who try to manage and control their drinking don\u2019t fare as well in the long run as those who swear off entirely.</p> <p>When I was 10 years old, my mother went to AA to kick her addiction to alcohol and benzodiazepines. She, too, survived overdoses and suicide attempts, then got clean and sober and stayed that way for 36 years until <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/mar/03/we-dont-lose-our-mothers-reality-more-violent-that-that\">she died of cancer</a>.<br></p> <p>In her last days, hundreds of people streamed through her hospice room \u2013 people she\u2019d sponsored in AA, their kids and grandkids. More than one person shook my hand and said without my mother, they\u2019d have been long dead.</p> <p>After a week, the hospice administrators essentially asked us to leave because we were too loud. We were laughing too much, singing old Roberta Flack songs together, handing out cake and cookies and other snacks, holding each other up through the pain.</p> <p>My mother died at home, borne away on morphine and constant pain, but she died surrounded by people who loved her and whose lives she had enriched.</p> <p>An ex-boyfriend whom I\u2019ll call Alex, wasn\u2019t so lucky. He quit drinking and joined AA for a couple of years, then relapsed. On a crack, alcohol and crystal meth binge, he contracted HIV during a blackout.</p> <p>He struggled back into the program, took antiviral meds, and was pulling his life together when he suddenly fell off the radar again. He had decided he was going to do some controlled drinking, but stay off drugs.</p> <p>Weeks later, I read on Facebook that he was dead. They found his body face down on the basement floor of a crack house in New Orleans.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://psychcentral.com/news/2016/09/15/quitting-alcohol-may-be-easier-than-cutting-back/109896.html\">Gothenberg University study</a>\u2019s lead author, Dr Kristina Berglund, found that \u201cpatients whose goal was total abstinence were more successful than those who had chosen to control their drinking \u2026 Our study shows that, regardless of agreement on goals and methods, in the end it is more difficult to stick to controlled drinking than to give it up entirely.\u201d This has been my experience and the experience I see twice a week (or more) at meetings. AA may not be for everyone, but it has worked for me. </p> <p>Living with addiction is like having a monster in your house that breathes fire and has chainsaws for hands. Like the creature in <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2321549/reference\">The Babadook</a>, it\u2019s going to live with you forever and it will kill you if it gets out of control.<br></p> <p>Having a recovery program has enabled me to build a cage for that monster. Every now and then my addiction howls and rattles the bars or whispers seductively that if I just let it out for a little air, it won\u2019t hurt anyone, promise. Bitter experience has shown me, however, that everyone in my life is safer if I keep that cage locked.</p> <p>If you are struggling to manage your relationship with drugs and alcohol, I urge you to seek help beyond yourself, whether it\u2019s in a recovery program or with an addiction counselor. It\u2019s like those old Charter Hospital commercials from the 1990s said, \u201cIf you don\u2019t seek help with us, please, seek help somewhere.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Is coming into work when you\u2019re so sick that you\u2019re on the verge of collapse really something we should be praising, or encouraging?

I suspect at one time or another we\u2019ve all uttered the words \u201cdon\u2019t worry, it\u2019s nothing serious\u201d, or struggled in only to be greeted by a concerned colleague who politely asked us to go home and stop sneezing on them.</p> <p>Whether it\u2019s guilt about letting down the team, concern your tasks won\u2019t get covered or more likely some fear that it might be counted against you, the trend for employees to come into work or to work longer hours when they should be taking time off has been growing.</p> <p>Research by Simplyhealth and the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development (CIPD), where I work as chief executive, shows \u201cpresenteeism\u201d is on the rise. Our <a href=\"https://www.cipd.co.uk/research/absence-management-survey.aspx\" title=\"\">2015 survey</a> showed that in the preceding 12 months, a third of firms reported a rise in employees working when they\u2019re sick, and this has some pretty clear negative effects on employee wellbeing. Organisations that have noticed an increase in presenteeism are nearly twice as likely to report an increase in stress-related absence and more than twice as likely to report an increase in mental health problems among their staff too.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/sep/15/hillary-clinton-returns-campaign-pneumonia-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/537dd\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2721721\"            data-video-name=\"Hillary Clinton, back on the campaign trail: \u2018I'm doing great\u2019 \u2013\u00a0video\"            data-video-provider=\"Reuters\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-57daf05de4b067ad300881c3\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/09/15/160915Clinton_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/09/15/160915Clinton.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/09/15/160915Clinton_WebM.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/sep/15/hillary-clinton-returns-campaign-pneumonia-video\">Hillary Clinton, back on the campaign trail: \u2018I\u2019m doing great\u2019 \u2013 video</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>Greater uncertainty in the economy and regarding jobs in recent years, together with an increasingly \u201calways on\u201d working environment and the pressure to perform are all factors driving this trend. Many of the companies and employees we talk to cite job insecurity as a reason for increased presenteeism, with employees fearing that a competitive job market, and the growth of automation, will make them more replaceable.</p> <p>But leaders and managers set the tone, and have a responsibility not just to their organisation but also to the wellbeing of their employees. As our research shows, increasing presenteeism leads to increased prevalence of stress, and there is a wealth of evidence, such as the Towers Watson <a href=\"file:///Volumes/Downloads/Internet%20Downloads/Towers-Watson-Insider-Workers-Still-Uneasy-About-Financial.pdf\" title=\"\">2014 Global Benefits Attitudes survey</a>, which clearly shows that workplace stress leads to less productive employees.</p> <p>So why, then, do more than half of all organisations admit that they aren\u2019t doing anything to combat this growing problem? It may well be that they believe that promoting long-term employee wellbeing might come at the expense of the short-term success of an organisation, but it can also be a lack of awareness of the growth of a corporate culture that accepts or even encourages presenteeism.</p> <p>To perform at our best, people need to be well both physically and mentally. If businesses want employees who are engaged and motivated, then employees need to feel that their organisation, their managers and bosses are supporting them, and not pressuring them to work when they are not properly fit.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/sep/08/zero-hours-contracts-used-far-beyond-short-term-work-research-says\">Zero-hours contracts used far beyond short-term work, research says</a> </p> </aside>  <p>How do we change this culture? It has to come from the top down. Employees won\u2019t feel empowered to take time off when they\u2019re sick if their manager\u2019s behaviour runs counter to that. The second action businesses can take is to build a culture that emphasises healthy living.</p> <p>Health should be promoted in the workplace, with people given the opportunity to learn more about their own health, to exercise and eat well within the workplace and beyond. At the CIPD, we host discounted zumba and yoga classes each week. TransferWise takes all its staff on annual company holidays, while the law firm Allen &amp; Overy has GPs and dentists on site. Those are at the more expensive end of the scale, but even simple things like free fruit for staff, a perk offered by just 15% of employers, can help instil a healthier work culture.</p> <p>Mental health and particularly the understanding of stress is equally important and is perhaps even more challenging. Much more needs to be done to educate managers in how to show understanding and ask the right questions, and how and where to find the right support. Leaders in this field, such as Google, have built good mental health into their culture by offering <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/google-meditation-mindfulness-technology\" title=\"\">mindfulness classes</a> to staff, while many large employers in the City, such as KPMG and Deloitte, have launched the <a href=\"http://citymha.org.uk/\" title=\"\">City Mental Health Alliance</a>, working with charities to end the stigma attached to mental health problems.</p> <p>The message to business is clear; a workforce that is well, works well. Clinton may have wanted to preserve her image of strength, but she wasn\u2019t being honest with herself. We need our leaders \u2013 in the workplace and beyond \u2013 to take responsibility for their own health and wellbeing first, to set the right example.</p> <p>Only then does this damaging culture of presenteeism have any chance of changing.</p>",

  "<p>By now, we all know the greatest priority of Justin Trudeau\u2019s Liberal government is its relationship with Indigenous peoples. How could we miss the weekly reminders? <br></p> <p>Trudeau graciously wrapping himself in ceremonial blankets. Hauling jugs of drinking water door-to-door on a northern reserve lacking potable water. Paddling the Ottawa river in his dad\u2019s buckskin jacket and moccasins with Indigenous youth, after a sunrise ritual at dawn.</p> <p>Welcome to the era of reconciliation, ushered in by a Prime Minister so different in appearance from his predecessors. Free of prejudices. Moved to tears by the country\u2019s dark history. Committed to the need for deep, fundamental change. </p> <p>Except this carefully scripted story, <a href=\"http://news.nationalpost.com/news/canada/canadian-politics/shoal-lake-trip-was-key-element-in-trudeau-government-post-budget-messaging-blitz\">managed even more tightly</a> than ex-Prime Minister Stephen Harper\u2019s, has long been unravelling. </p> <p>It began with the fraying of Trudeau\u2019s official platform. A legal order issued to the Liberals to end racial discrimination against Indigenous children? <a href=\"http://aptn.ca/news/2016/09/15/tribunal-orders-canada-again-to-comply-with-its-ruling-on-first-nation-child-welfare/\">Repeatedly ignored</a>. Compensation for 16,000 individuals snatched from their homes and adopted by non-Indigenous families in the Sixties Scoop? <a href=\"https://www.thestar.com/opinion/editorials/2016/08/22/ottawa-must-apologize-for-sixties-scoop-and-compensate-survivors-editorial.html\">Opposed in court</a>. And that historic budget for First Nations? Turned out most of the funds <a href=\"http://aptn.ca/news/2016/03/22/federal-liberal-budget-failed-first-nation-children-families-blackstock/\">would flow</a> only in 2020\u2014after the next election. Not exactly the \u201cnew relationship\u201d that Trudeau announced to rapturous international applause.</p> <p>And then there\u2019s what hasn\u2019t made the headlines. In British Columbia, Quebec, the Atlantic provinces and elsewhere through Canada, there are scores of First Nations who have never signed away their Aboriginal title through treaties. For years they\u2019ve racked up debt while in negotiations with the government over lands sought after by mineral, forestry, hydro and oil companies. But as a pre-condition for any compensation, they\u2019re <a href=\"https://ricochet.media/en/1154/trudeau-cloaks-continued-attack-on-first-nations-sovereignty-with-charm\">forced to extinguish</a> their rights to 9 out of every 10 parcels of their territory\u2014rivers, forests, mountains, farmland, and everything underneath.</p> <p>Fair to have expected a change under Trudeau? Instead the Liberals have given negotiators marching orders from a Harper-commissioned report that <a href=\"https://ricochet.media/en/125/harper-first-nations-assimilation-agenda\">advises</a> how to force through energy infrastructure. That\u2019s because Indigenous rights stand in the way of pipelines, mega-dams like Site C, giant fracked gas terminals\u2014and $650bn in resource projects over the next ten years that the Liberals are trumpeting as much as the Conservatives did.</p> <p>Never mind that recent Supreme Court decisions, and the Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples before them, call for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/true-north/2014/oct/21/the-indigenous-land-rights-ruling-that-could-transform-canada\">shared sovereignty or management</a> over these lands. Or that many more Canadians are realizing that Indigenous stewardship of large swathes of territory\u2014instead of its mismanagement by multi-national corporations\u2014would be to the benefit of everyone. </p> <p>Trudeau may indeed want to do right by Indigenous peoples, but the government is locked into a logic of its own: quietly maintaining exclusive control over Indigenous peoples\u2019 lands and resources. Is this what Trudeau meant when he said his government would \u201cthink seven generations out\u201d?</p> <p>Turning the language of liberation into a contraption of conquest is nothing new: it\u2019s part of Liberal heritage. In the early 1990s, as calls for Indigenous self-determination gained steam on the heels of widespread protest and the Oka crisis, the Liberals appeared to embrace the movement\u2019s demand. They named their policy \u201cthe Inherent Right to Self-Government.\u201d </p> <p>Yet this policy\u2014still on the books\u2014only grants First Nations rights such as policing, education, and the licensing of marriages; the government keeps all powers of trade, diplomacy and serious economic development and decision-making to themselves. No wonder Indigenous critics have said it turns First Nations into \u201cethnic municipalities\u201d: it is nothing like a genuine third-order of government. </p> <p>The Liberals latest utterances appear just as soothingly promising: \u201creconciliation,\u201d \u201cnation-to-nation,\u201d even \u201cdecolonization.\u201d The most slippery of all has been their use of \u201cconsent.\u201d Though the Liberals have proclaimed their support for the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples\u2014at whose heart lies the right of \u201cfree, prior and informed consent\u201d\u2014they\u2019ve been loath to recognize it in practice on the ground. </p> <p>It\u2019s obvious why: the right of consent sends shudders through corporate boardrooms whose goodwill the Liberals covet. As an alternative, the government has <a href=\"http://aptn.ca/news/2016/05/09/trudeau-government-eyeing-nwts-collaborate-consent-model-as-part-of-undrip-implementation/\">wheeled</a> out a hazy concept of \u201ccollaborative consent.\u201d All that\u2019s clear is it studiously avoids recognizing the actual right to say no to destructive resource projects. Indigenous feminists have <a href=\"http://landbodydefense.org/\">underlined</a> the hollowness of this half-measure: whether it\u2019s territories or bodies, if you don\u2019t have the power to say no, then \u201cconsent\u201d is meaningless.</p> <p>The extractivist worldview\u2014bent on treating everything as a commodity\u2014that lay behind Stephen Harper\u2019s resource agenda just as powerfully shapes Trudeau\u2019s. In fact, the Liberals\u2019 attempt to wrap themselves in the UN Declaration without embracing its central right may constitute a new, more subtle form of extraction: the extraction from Indigenous territory of consent itself.</p> <p>Liberal moves to extract and manufacture consent and support for outdated policies are evident elsewhere: restoring funding to the Assembly of First Nations, a government-dependent organization that has since plumped frequently for them; appointing an Indigenous Justice Minister, even though Indigenous critics argue she has sided with the government agenda throughout her political career; and agreeing to call an inquiry into missing and murdered Indigenous women, but with a <a href=\"http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/missing-women-marion-buller-reaction-mmiw-inquiry-1.3705804\">mandate</a> far short of what impacted families wanted. As the weight of reality presses against Trudeau\u2019s rhetoric, the ability to generate consent is crumbling.</p> <p>Reconciliation is a powerful hope, an uplifting prospect, a deeply desired new relationship that Trudeau has compellingly invoked. But if reconciliation does not include the restitution of land, the recognition of real self-government, the reigning in of abusive police, the remediation of rivers and forests, it will remain a vacant notion, a cynical ploy to preserve a status quo in need not of tinkering but transformation.

  "<p>Some of the most important stories published by the Guardian have come from whistleblowers. Their disclosures have been vital in exposing stories of huge public interest, sometimes with global ramifications. Our pledge is to protect our sources \u2010 and not to disclose their identities, or our communications with them, unless their approval has been given. If you want to get in touch with us in a way that protects your security and anonymity, there are a number of technical options that may help \u2013 although, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/data-computer-security\">of course</a>, none of them can be 100% guaranteed.</p> <h2>Messaging apps</h2> <p>Phone apps do little to hide who and where you are, but if your priority is confidentiality rather than anonymity, there are a number of apps that offer <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/End-to-end_encryption\">\u201cend to end\u201d encryption</a>. They include Signal (from the <a href=\"https://whispersystems.org/\">Open Whisper Systems</a> not-for-profit organisation) and <a href=\"https://threema.ch/en\">Threema</a>. (These are examples. We don\u2019t endorse any particular security app.) The Guardian investigation teams can all be contacted using Signal:</p> <ul> <li><p>London: <a href=\"tel:+447584640566\">+44 7584 640566</a><br></p></li> <li><p>New York: <a href=\"tel:+16469260436\">+1 646 926 0436</a></p></li> <li><p>Sydney: <a href=\"tel:+61457262172\">+61 457 262172</a></p></li> </ul> <p>End to end encryption means \u2010 theoretically \u2010 nobody else will be able to see the content of any message you send. To get started, you need to share mobile phone numbers with a reporter. That\u2019s not difficult to do; you can ring the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/help/contact-us\">Guardian head office</a> from a landline (preferably not from work or home, which could be easy to trace) to get put through to the reporter concerned, and then share details. Or you can do so using one of the following methods.</p> <h2>Email</h2> <p>If you plan to write an email to a Guardian journalist about a sensitive matter, look into <a href=\"https://ssd.eff.org/en/module/introduction-public-key-cryptography-and-pgp\">PGP encryption</a>. It\u2019s more complicated than using apps, but is probably more secure in practice, and email is much easier for sending longer messages and attachments. Used properly, PGP should make a message or document unreadable to anyone except the person who sent it and the person for whom it was encrypted.</p> <p>How does it work? With PGP, you will use a \u201cpublic key\u201d that belongs to the person you are writing to, but is freely available on the internet. This key turns your message into an unreadable jumble. Your recipient \u2013 and no one else \u2013 has a corresponding \u201cprivate key\u201d which can unlock messages that were encrypted by their public key.</p> <p>Public keys for Guardian journalists can be found on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/pgp\">https://www.theguardian.com/pgp</a> and on many writers\u2019 profile pages.</p> <p>Two popular PGP encryption software packages are <a href=\"https://www.gpg4win.org/\">Gpg4win</a> for Windows and <a href=\"https://gpgtools.org/gpgsuite.html\">GPG Suite</a> for Macs. If you use a browser to access a webmail service, such as Gmail or Yahoo! Mail, you may want to look at <a href=\"https://www.mailvelope.com/\">Mailvelope</a>.</p> <p>PGP can be a bit fiddly. It\u2019s best to play around with it first by sending an email containing relatively innocuous content.</p> <p>Although there\u2019s no easy way to break PGP codes, it does have shortcomings. An encrypted email message can still reveal the identity of the sender. One way to reduce that risk could be to create an independent email address solely for contacting the Guardian. You may want to use computers that aren\u2019t associated with you when setting up and when using such an account. Going to an internet cafe is one option \u2010 just be careful about who can see your screen and whether there are CCTV cameras nearby. And think about the information you provide while signing up to a new account. Does any of it link the new address back to you?</p> <p>If you\u2019re using a shared computer, remember that email and browser software normally retains a history of what you\u2019ve been doing, unless you clear it or use a private browsing or incognito option. And consider the times at which you send messages. Could that information help prove that you sent them?</p> <h2>Tor</h2> <p>Even an anonymous email address doesn\u2019t conceal the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_address\">IP address</a> from which a message has been sent, and an IP address could be traced back to you. To help avoid this you could use the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tor_(anonymity_network)\">Tor network</a>, which bounces your message through a series of relays to hide the source location. To access the Tor network you will need to install <a href=\"https://www.torproject.org/\">Tor software</a>. Tor browsers can be configured to discard your browsing history and to minimise the amount of information you share.</p> <p>As with email, if your computer is being monitored at source, Tor does not protect you from that.</p> <h2>Tails</h2> <p><a href=\"https://tails.boum.org/\">Tails</a>, which is short for \u201cThe Amnesiac and Incognito Live System\u201d, is a computer operating system designed to preserve security. It connects to the internet using the Tor network; it helps guard against local monitoring; and when you log out, it wipes any unencrypted content. It is far more secure than using a normal computer or phone.</p> <h2>SecureDrop</h2> <p>The best way to contact the Guardian securely is through our <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/securedrop\">SecureDrop</a> document portal.</p> <p>The SecureDrop site is only accessible over the Tor network. All submitted messages and documents are automatically encrypted. We download those encrypted files on to Tails computers and then decode them in a secure environment on a computer that is <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_gap_(networking)\">completely offline</a>. SecureDrop does not record where things came from: all we can see is what has been sent to us, the time it arrived, and a randomly generated code name for whoever submitted it.</p> <p>For maximum security and anonymity, contact us via SecureDrop from a computer that you are confident is not being monitored.</p> <p>You don\u2019t have to provide us with a means of contacting you but it can sometimes be useful for us to be able to do so. It can also help us if you are able to provide some background about what is in the documents and why you think they might be of interest to us.</p> <p><em>We previously mentioned WhatsApp in the Messaging Apps section of this page. In view of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/jan/13/whatsapp-backdoor-allows-snooping-on-encrypted-messages\">concerns over its implementation of encryption</a>, we have removed it.</em></p>",

In others, it sends \u201cAmber alert\u201d notifications to aid the location of a crime victim, often a kidnapped child, or to tell recipients to avoid the area where a violent crime is being committed or from which a suspect is fleeing. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2016/sep/19/us-authorities-investigating-new-jersey-explosive-devices-live-updates\">New York bombings: Clinton criticizes Trump rhetoric \u2013 live</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But as far as the Guardian could determine, the WEA had never been used to ask citizens to help law enforcement hunt for the suspect of a crime committed days before.</p> <p>Elizabeth Joh, a law professor at the University of California, Davis, said that while desperate times call for desperate measures, it\u2019s important to weigh those measures carefully. \u201cThe gravity of the situation is obvious,\u201d she told the Guardian. \u201cBut that everyone with a camera and immediate access to social media should be enlisted by means of the cellphone [WEA] is a different question.

Corbyn said:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Thank you to Apulina and Raestory for your questions. I have voiced my support for decriminalisation in the past, motivated by not wanting those engaged in prostitution to become criminals, but I recognise there are a range of passionately-held views by those currently in sex work, and those such as Raestory, who identify themselves as survivors, by campaigners, and women\u2019s rights activists. All these people have women\u2019s interests and equality at heart. Where we can agree is that women in prostitution and sex work should not be criminalised or stigmatised, and have their human and citizen rights protected, and have access to the support of social, health, public services and justice.

I have many political influences, from my mother and father and also as a late teenager living and working in Jamaica and travelling throughout Latin America, I could see the dreadful levels of inequality there.

In<a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/opinion/2016/09/17/the-royal-yacht-should-sail-again/\"> an editorial</a> the paper said:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Brexit, and the need to negotiate new trade deals, is calling the royal yacht back to service.

It has demonstrated its potential before: Britannia brought in an estimated \u00a33 billion in commercial deals between 1991 and 1995. Now that the UK is taking back control of its national trade arrangements from Brussels, engagement with countries such as Australia and Canada is primed to begin. Britain is rediscovering its ancient role as a seafaring, mercantile power. In that context, the symbolism of the royal yacht is striking.</p> </blockquote> <p>But, when the spokesman was asked if the prime minister supported this campaign, he said the government was looking at \u201ca number of ways\u201d in which the government could achieve its ambition of turning the UK into a \u201cglobal leader for free trade\u201d.

When it was put to him that Johnson had called him \u201cincompetent\u201d, \u201cuseless\u201d and \u201cincapable\u201d, Corbyn replied:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Very kind of Alan. How generous of him ... Alan hasn\u2019t fully understood what my concerns were in the past. My concerns were when a Labour government led by Tony Blair took us into war in Iraq, I opposed that. When he tried to bring in, and indeed did bring in, tuition fees, I opposed him on that. I think he should understand my opposition to those issues was on the politics of it. I didn\u2019t indulge in that language that many have used against me, and I never will. </p> </blockquote> <p>Here is a flavour of what Johnson said in the interview.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>[Corbyn] is totally incompetent and incapable of being the leader of a political party and he knows it,\u201d he says. \u201cHe hasn\u2019t got a huge ego but it\u2019s got bigger and he\u2019s self-righteous. There\u2019s this adulation out there, it goes to your head. No compromise with the electorate was the left\u2019s theme in the early Eighties and God forbid we go back to that.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>Corbyn rejected suggestions that he was avoiding giving interviews to mainstream media outlets. </strong>Nick Robinson, who was interviewing Corbyn, said this was the first interview with Today Corbyn had agreed to do since the leadership contest started. Citing <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/17/jeremy-corbyn-should-be-tougher-not-my-style\">what Corbyn said in his Guardian interview on Saturday about how \u201ccommunication is everything\u201d </a>, Robinson put it to him that if he avoided interviews with the mainstream media, he could not win an election. Corbyn did not accept this. He insisted that he had done plenty of media:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>With the deepest and greatest respect to the Today programme - I know it\u2019s the most important radio programme on the whole planet - it is not the only radio programme on the whole planet.

Coyle, who was one of the Labour MPs named <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/14/corbyns-team-mistakenly-issues-list-of-mps-who-undermined-leader\">on a list of supposed abusive rebels released by the Corbyn camp last week,</a>said that if Corbyn was re-elected, he and his supporters would \u201cjust continue to cause abuse\u201d. Referring to the list Coyle said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>If this is their attempt at reaching out or an attempt at engagement, then they are failing abysmally. He [Mr Corbyn] knew about it and did nothing to stop it being drawn up, did nothing to stop it being published, and has done nothing to demonstrate that he is interested in a unified party, which is why I say to any Labour members still listening who haven\u2019t voted yet, they still have until Wednesday to make sure we end this nonsense. </p> <p>They are not interested in party unity. If they are re-elected, they will just continue to cause abuse. A year ago, the kind of abuse we are seeing in British politics, certainly on the left, was not there. Either by incompetence of design, it has happened under Jeremy\u2019s watch and he should take some responsibility for it.</p> </blockquote> <p>Coyle said that some members of Momentum, the pro-Corbyn group, were \u201cpragmatic and want to win and want to engage with voters\u201d. But he said some Momentum activists were on the hard left and that Corbyn and John McDonnell were encouraging them.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>There is a section who aren\u2019t interested in Labour winning the election, and are interested in only having a particular ideology and -ism at the top of the party. That\u2019s unfortunate, and sadly Jeremy and John McDonnell in particular, they are encouraging that to continue - they are not trying to tackle it.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cedaad3aae7fff1b756b57dceb3327ceed0b3730\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cedaad3aae7fff1b756b57dceb3327ceed0b3730/20_25_1922_1152/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Neil Coyle.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Neil Coyle.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tolga Akmen/LNP/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57df97cfe4b0c762d480ddf7\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-19T07:47:33.496Z\">8.47am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Corbyn says there's a 'thirst for greater democracy' in Labour</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here\u2019s our story about Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s comments on Today.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/19/jeremy-corbyn-calls-on-labour-mps-to-recognise-thirst-for-greater-democracy\">Corbyn calls on Labour MPs to recognise 'thirst for greater democracy'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>And here\u2019s how it starts.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>There is \u201ca thirst for greater democracy\u201d within Labour, Jeremy Corbyn has said on the eve of a party meeting where he is expected to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/17/jeremy-corbyn-labour-leadership-members-choose-shadow-team\">propose letting members help choose the shadow cabinet</a>, a move that could cement his position as leader.</p> <p>However, less than a week before he is expected to be re-elected as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour\">Labour</a> leader, Corbyn also said he was reaching out to dissatisfied party MPs, and stressed that they did not have to agree with everything he did.</p> <p>He told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme that Labour MPs needed to appreciate that they had \u201cto try and deliver for the people\u201d.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57df9071e4b0c762d480dddb\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-19T07:36:38.601Z\">8.36am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The \u201cgood cop/bad cop\u201d routine is a familiar one in any negotiation and it is a strategy the Labour leadership seems to have been adopting as <strong>Jeremy Corbyn</strong> ponders what to do about the majority of MPs who do not support his leadership.

He was asked why he thought being able to get hundreds of people to attend a rally could lead to him gaining power. Corbyn said that tens of thousands of people had attended his rallies over the summer. That showed there was a real \u201cinterest in politics\u201d, he said. The crowds were \u201cpretty diverse\u201d, he went on, and quite different from the sort of people who used to turn up to hear him speak before he became Labour leader.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>That then becomes, surely, a very strong campaigning basis for the Labour movement, becomes a campaigning factor in towns and cities where there\u2019s never been very much activity before.

Asked by the Guardian whether she would consider calls for Britain to resettle more refugees, she said: \u201cWe have always taken the view that we can help more Syrian refugees by putting aid into the region.\u201d </p> <p>She added that some Syrians were also coming to the UK through the normal asylum-seeking routes, as well as 3,000 children from the region.</p> <p>Her answer appears to confirm that May will take the same approach as David <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/04/david-cameron-concessions-syrian-child-refugees\">Cameron, who only agreed to the programme for vulnerable refugees from Syria under pressure</a>.

She said: \u201cWe are working with local authorities and NGOs in relation to delivering on the Dubs amendment and we have for example speeded up our processes for ensuring family reunification can take place.\u201d</p> <p>May\u2019s main intervention at the UN summit will be to awarn of the dangers that mass uncontrolled migration poses. She will call for a better global system to manage the movement of people and propose better differentiation between refugees and economic migrants. It is understood that she is unlikely to announce any increase in the quota of refugees to be accepted, but the UK is expected to commit more money and humanitarian aid at the summit.</p> <p>Obama and the outgoing UN secretary general Ban Ki-moon hope to make progress in getting world leaders to pledge more help for refugees before the end of their tenures. Amnesty and other groups, however, have criticised the declaration due to be adopted at the UN summit for lacking teeth and merely reiterating humanitarian principles.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/sep/12/rowan-williams-200-faith-leaders-open-letter-revise-refugee-policy\">Rowan Williams, the former archbishop of Canterbury, was one of 200 religious leaders who called last week for more action from the UK</a>, criticising the government\u2019s response to the refugee crisis as \u201ctoo slow, too low and too narrow\u201d.</p> <p>David Miliband, the head of the International Rescue Committee in New York, said this weekend that May should use the summit to promise that the UK would resettle more refugees. \u201cFrankly, the UK should be saying \u2018we\u2019ll take 20,000 or 25,000 a year\u2019, so four times the current level to match the commitment of countries like Canada.\u201d</p> <p>Maurice Wren, the chief executive of the Refugee Council, said: \u201cThese proposals indicate that the prime minister is intent on attempting to reinforce the untenable status quo, blocking off people\u2019s escape routes and leaving poor countries looking after nearly nine out of 10 of the world\u2019s refugees. </p> <p>\u201cWhat we really need to see instead is the UK leading by example, adopting sustainable solutions aimed at saving refugees\u2019 lives and implementing a more equitable system for sharing responsibility for protecting them.\u201d</p> <p>Yvette Cooper, the chair of Labour\u2019s refugee taskforce, called on May to meet the government\u2019s pledge to resettle 20,000 Syrians two years early and offer more help to those fleeing the war. \u201cThis will be a terrible missed opportunity if we don\u2019t get strong international action, and if Britain doesn\u2019t show the leadership needed,\u201d she said. </p> <p>\u201cThe prime minister is not doing enough. She is right to say there is a distinction between refugees and economic migrants, that is exactly why Britain should be doing more to help those fleeing persecution and war. Alongside border controls, we also need safe, legal routes to sanctuary including speeding up family reunion which is far too slow and mired in bureaucracy.</p> <p>\u201cAfter a 14-year-old boy died in Calais trying to reach his brother in the UK, children\u2019s safety should be the top of the agenda. There are 900 children alone in Calais at serious risk of harm and exploitation. It is a complete disgrace that still not a single child has been helped under the Dubs legislation parliament voted for, and that Home Office delays are blocking hundreds of unaccompanied children from reaching their family and safety.\u201d</p> <p>As well as making an intervention on migration, May will host a \u201cround table\u201d on stopping modern slavery and trafficking - one of her personal priorities as home secretary.</p> <p>The prime minister will point to the UK\u2019s new taskforce and announce that the heads of Mi5, Mi6, GCHQ and Interpol will join it when required. \u201cJust as it was Britain that took an historic stand to ban slavery two centuries ago, I am determined that the United Kingdom will once again lead the way in defeating modern slavery,\u201d she said ahead of the session for world leaders.</p> <p>In her maiden speech to the UN on Tuesday, May will call on the UN to deal better with problems that need a global response such as terrorism, mass migration and modern slavery. </p> <p>At the summit, May will also defend the vote for Brexit in her speech to the UN, saying the British people \u201cdid not vote to turn inwards or walk away from any of our partners in the world\u201d but they did want \u201ca politics that is more in touch with their concerns and bold action to address them\u201d.</p> <p>She will echo her claim made at the G20 in China that too many people are feeling left behind by globalisation.</p> <p>May is expected to have bilateral meetings with Ban Ki-moon, and the prime ministers of Pakistan, New Zealand, Egypt, and Turkey.

In response to the delay, the attorneys said, Tyre\u2019s family decided to hire an independent forensic pathologist from Michigan to evaluate the number, characteristics and location of the gunshot wounds on Tyre.</p> <p>\u201cBased on the location and the direction of the wound paths it is more likely than not that Tyre King was in the process of running away from the shooter or shooters when he suffered all three gunshot wounds,\u201d the examiner, Dr Francisco Diaz, said, <a href=\"https://www.waltonbrownlaw.com/news/30\">according to a statement from the family</a>. Co-attorney Sean Walton told the Guardian in an email that Diaz conducted his examination of Tyre\u2019s body on Sunday. The attorneys didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for a copy of Diaz\u2019s report.</p> <p>Tyre was killed last Wednesday at 7.42pm, when authorities responded to a report of an armed robbery of $10 by a group of teenagers. When officers arrived, Tyre was spotted with two other males who matched a description of the suspects and soon fled on foot. As officer Bryan Mason approached King, police said the child removed a BB gun from his waistband, before he was shot \u201cmultiple\u201d times. Tyre was transferred to a hospital and pronounced dead at 8.22pm.</p> <p>Mason, a nine-year veteran of the Columbus police division, has since been placed on administrative leave and will receive psychological counseling.

The wounds were found on his temple, collarbone and the left flank, the statement said.</p> <p>Diaz is an assistant professor of pathology at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/francisco-diaz-md-fcap-2309a491\">according to his LinkedIn page</a>, and since 2001 he has worked as a medical examiner in Wayne County, Michigan. Diaz didn\u2019t didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment.

Last week, he told the Columbus Dispatch that Tyre wanted to rob someone for money, and that he was with him at the time of the shooting.</p> <p>\u201cThe cops said to get down,\u201d Braxton told the newspaper. \u201cWe got down, but my friend got up and ran \u2026 [and] when he ran, the cop shot him.\u201d Police claimed in court documents that Braxton was armed with \u201cwhat appeared to be a black semi-automatic handgun\u201d, <a href=\"http://abc6onyourside.com/news/local/suspect-in-robbery-related-to-tyre-king-shooting-set-to-face-a-judge\">according to the ABC affiliate in Columbus</a>, and that he was involved in the robbery of a man for $10. Braxton was expected to be arraigned on Monday.</p> <p>Attorneys for Tyre\u2019s family declined a request by the Guardian on Sunday for an interview. In the statement, the family asked the public to \u201ccontinue to withhold final judgment until all the facts are known and vetted\u201d.

  "<p>Forty-eight years ago, your correspondent was at the non-striker\u2019s end when Surrey\u2019s Arnold Long edged a ball from the seamer Tony Nicholson to Long\u2019s opposite number, Jimmy Binks, standing up to the stumps, to complete a hat-trick of County Championship titles for Yorkshire. Since then, seven other counties have tried to emulate the feat and fallen short (Middlesex, who won in 1976 and tied in 1977; Essex, champions in 1983 and 1984 and again in 1991 and 92; Worcestershire, 1988 and 89; Warwickshire, 1994 and 95; Surrey, 2002 and 03; Sussex, 2006 and 07; and Durham 2008 and 09).</p> <p>Now, though, in the final round of County Championship matches of a long season, the chance is there for Yorkshire to follow their illustrious predecessors, although the task is not a straightforward one. This is the tightest title race for years and may yet be decided on bonus points and with it the realisation that a point squandered early in the season is no less valuable than one scrapped for in the later stages.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/sep/19/adil-rashid-yorkshire-absent-personal-reasons\">Yorkshire\u2019s Adil Rashid cites \u2018personal reasons\u2019 for absence at Middlesex</a> </p> </aside>  <p>As it stands, Middlesex, 12 times winners including two shared titles, are nine points clear of Yorkshire, 32 plus one shared, and 10 ahead of Somerset, three times runners-up this millennium but who have never won.</p> <p>Middlesex will slug it out with Yorkshire at Lord\u2019s while Somerset are playing Nottinghamshire, already relegated, at Taunton. The possibilities are several. Clearly, if Middlesex win, they will be champions. Likewise if their match is drawn and Somerset fail to win.</p> <p>Should Yorkshire win and Somerset fail to do so, then it is the White Rose that triumphs. Beyond that the complications occur but, essentially, if Yorkshire and Somerset win then Somerset need to beat Yorkshire\u2019s points total by one because of a tie\u2011break regarding fewest defeats would give them the edge. While there is a certain <em>joie de vivre </em>about the manner Somerset have manoeuvred themselves into contention with the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/sep/14/yorkshire-somerset-county-championship-division-one-day-three-match-report\" title=\"\">demolition of Yorkshire in the last round</a> of matches, there has been a rancourous leadup to the Lord\u2019s confrontation involving both counties the England and Wales Cricket Board, and even accompanied by a conspiracy theory that alludes to former county affiliation among senior administrators.</p> <p>Yorkshire have become inured to losing players to international cricket \u2013 it was ever thus for successful sides who then must demonstrate their depth of talent \u2013 and have been prepared to concede that Joe Root is a special case. England\u2019s centrally contracted players are no longer employed by the counties, but for different reasons Yorkshire will go into the match without Jonny Bairstow and Adil Rashid, while the Australian batsman Jake Lehmann, who scored a century against Somerset, has been recalled by South Australia.</p> <p>Yorkshire are compensated when Bairstow and Rashid are on England duty although still effectively retain control. But Andrew Strauss and the England head coach, Trevor Bayliss, are insisting Bairstow, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/sep/18/yorkshire-angry-jonny-bairstow-refused-permission-title-finale\" title=\"\">who is desperate to play</a>, must rest instead before the winter tours, angering the county, particularly when they will see Steve Finn, similarly selected for the tour to Bangladesh, in the opposition.</p> <p>Rashid is a different case in that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/sep/19/adil-rashid-yorkshire-absent-personal-reasons\" title=\"\">he was available but has opted out</a>. He has cited plausible underlying reasons \u2013 the illness of his grandmother and his own exhaustion after a long season \u2013 and says that he was available but, mentally, would not be able to perform at his best.</p> <p>The Yorkshire take on it appears to be different and Rashid\u2019s absence has made his county captain, Andrew Gale, who is not one to hide his light under a bushel and who would surely have been privy to all the circumstances, incandescent. The Yorkshire attitude is that if a player is as reluctant as that then his performance must suffer consequently, while the resolve of the XI who do play will be suitably stiffened. Rashid, though, is sailing close to the wind with his club and career: there are sceptics about, some with a greater depth of knowledge than most, and his card has been marked. The idea, by the way, that Finn\u2019s presence will be down to the influence of Strauss and Angus Fraser, the latter Middlesex\u2019s director of cricket as well as an England selector, because of county affiliation, is just absurd.</p> <p>It may be that Somerset have the best chance of winning their match. Their pitches have been such that only Warwickshire\u2019s Jeetan Patel has more wickets than the 58 of their left-arm spinner Jack Leach. But a result pitch, particularly one that spins from the start, could hinder their drive for batting points.</p> <p>They need all the points they can get for a Middlesex draw with full bonus points would be sufficient to take the title on the tie-break should Somerset drop even a single point in a win.</p> <p>It is harder to squeeze a result out of Lord\u2019s pitches these days. Middlesex do seem to have something of a hold over Yorkshire, though, winning matches against the run of play. That will count for something. Yorkshire will be throwing everything they have at Middlesex while the home captain, James Franklin, is insistent that they have no intention of trying to sneak the title with a draw. It should provide the very best of cut-and-thrust cricket.</p>",

  "<p>The world is witnessing an unprecedented surge in wildlife trafficking that is stealing the irreplaceable natural wealth of countries, greatly hindering development, paralysing efforts to eradicate poverty, and undermining conservation efforts.

It highlights that certain forms of illegal wildlife trade, such as the international illicit trade in rhino horn, would not be possible without corruption. </p> <p>It is well established that corruption harms people, undermining the rule of law, institutions and sustainable development. By enabling wildlife trafficking, it is also helping to drive species of wild animals and plants to extinction. </p> <p>Animals like elephants and rhinos are being slaughtered for their ivory and horn. Corruption often enables the passage of goods from source, through transit, to illicit markets and the unscrupulous dealers who may be many thousands of kilometres away from where the specimens were stolen. </p> <p>It\u2019s not just iconic species being affected. Pangolins are being wiped out for their meat and scales. Rosewood is being plundered from forests for timber. Smuggling of rare iguanas for the pet trade is decimating wild populations, an illicit trade that spans three continents, with the animals being poached in the Bahamas, trafficked into Europe and south-east Asia, and involving nationals from at least five countries. Illicit trade affects every country across the globe.</p> <p>The vast majority of officials are honest and committed. We salute them. Yet we also see customs and police officials bribed, logging and hunting licences forged, and poachers and wildlife traffickers set free due to obstructed prosecutions. We must root out the \u201cbad apples\u201d and deepen efforts to build and maintain properly paid, trained and equipped civil services, in every country, including Cites and enforcement authorities and park rangers. </p> <p>We cannot afford to turn a blind eye to this serious challenge. We have no option but to confront corruption head-on by fully deploying the international agreements created to combat corruption and to regulate wildlife trade in a coherent manner. </p> <p>That is why, in December 2015, corruption and wildlife and forest crime was the focus of a dedicated side event that we co-hosted at the sixth session of the Meeting of the Parties to the UN Convention Against Corruption.</p> <p>Cooperation between the UN Convention against Corruption and Cites is strong and we look forward to achieving universal membership for both conventions in the near future. UNODC and Cites are working together to integrate the tools to prevent corruption, and to facilitate the prosecution and punishment of offenders, with the international rules set for trade in wildlife. </p> <p>We are determined to help countries shatter the international criminal networks that supply this illicit trade and we are united in the belief that by aggressively addressing corruption, we can deal a lethal blow to all those involved in these highly destructive transnational organised crimes.</p> <p>Since Cites parties last <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/mar/03/thailand-outlaw-ivory-trade\">met in Bangkok in 2013</a>, discussions of the scourge of corruption has shifted from the corridors into open plenary and at this month\u2019s meeting parties will have before them, for the first time, a dedicated resolution on prohibiting, preventing and countering corruption.</p> <p></p> <p><strong><br></strong><br></p>",

Having triumphed, the four petitioners now face ending up skint for their trouble.</p> <p>John Biggs, the Labour politician who <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/jun/12/labour-tower-hamlets-lutfur-rahman-john-biggs\">won a re-run</a> of the voided 2014 election to succeed Rahman as mayor last June, has summed up the situation for the <a href=\"http://www.eastlondonadvertiser.co.uk/news/politics/law_must_protect_from_bankruptcy_those_who_ousted_lutfur_rahman_urges_tower_hamlets_mayor_1_4685214\">East London Advertiser</a>: \u201cIt\u2019s entirely wrong that they are facing this scale of legal bill despite their sacrifice being proved right. The legal system should be applauding them for challenging corruption, not burdening them to the point of bankruptcy.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s worth recalling what election commissioner Richard Mawrey QC did and did not write in his <a href=\"https://trialbyjeory.files.wordpress.com/2015/04/judgment.pdf\">measured and very readable judgement</a> on the petition. He concluded that Rahman had secured his win with the help of \u201ccorrupt and illegal practices\u201d involving the payment of canvassers, the false portrayal of Biggs as racist, allocating community grants in a manner that amounted to bribery, the casting of invalid votes and by bringing \u201cundue spiritual influence\u201d to bear on fellow Muslim voters. He annulled the election and banned Rahman from holding office for five years.</p> <p>He was also quite clear that the court could draw no conclusion about whether enough invalid votes had been cast to have affected the overall result of the election. And, relating to a persistent theme of some of the media coverage of Rahman, he noted that the court had \u201cnot heard a shred of credible evidence linking Mr Rahman with any extreme or fundamentalist Islamist movement\u201d. </p> <p>Some subsequent events are also worth mentioning here. The election court was not a criminal court and in March the police decided there was <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-35823318\">insufficient evidence</a> that any criminal offences had been committed in relation to the 2014 contest for them to investigate Rahman further. More recently another strand of media coverage of Rahman unravelled, with the Telegraph <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/05/07/mujibul-islam--an-apology/\">apologising</a> for a series of articles, most of them written by Boris Johnson\u2019s now former cycling commissioner Andrew Gilligan, which had, in the apology\u2019s own words, suggested that a local businessman was \u201ca willing beneficiary of Mr Rahman\u2019s corruption\u201d. The Telegraph accepts that this was \u201cuntrue\u201d and has paid the businessman concerned <a href=\"http://www.carter-ruck.com/news/read/telegraph-apologises-and-pays-damages-to-businessman-mujibul-islam\">damages and legal costs</a>. </p> <p>None of this is to downplay the wrong-doing documented in the election court judgement or to insinuate (as some still do) that Rahman is the blameless victim of racist Muslim-haters. On the contrary, it is to stress that an affair so damaging to the East End and so often clouded by misunderstandings and misrepresentations was always crying out for a thorough and dispassionate investigation by an authority with the right powers to do so.</p> <p>The election court, nothwithstanding the curiosities of the relevant legislation, provided this. But to secure it the petitioners had to go to risky financial lengths and are still paying the price, despite the bulk of their complaints being borne out.

At the start of her installation there was a mattress on a plinth and two tables of carefully bagged objects. By the time she\u2019d finished, My Bed was something special \u2013 it was art. But can you turn ordinary objects into art simply by saying so?</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2016/sep/16/tracey-emin-artist-1998-installation-my-bed-tate-liverpool-merseyside\">Tracey Emin makes her own crumpled bed and lies in it, on Merseyside</a> </p> </aside>  <p><a href=\"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2016/09/160918180006.htm\">An experiment</a> by neurologists at Erasmus University, Rotterdam, suggests people really do respond differently to an image or object when told it is \u201cart\u201d. Shown a variety of pictures, the student volunteers showed different neural reactions according to whether they were told they were looking at reality or art. \u201cThis work suggests that when we expect to be dealing with an artwork, our brain responds differently than when we expect to be dealing with reality,\u201d concludes Noah van Dongen, leader of the research team.</p> <p>Art, in other words, is in the mind of the beholder. Yet the research goes further: it reveals that the difference in the test subjects\u2019 responses to \u201cart\u201d and \u201creality\u201d was one of intensity. Told an image was art, people responded to it more calmly than if they thought it showed a real event. The Dutch researchers find evidence here to support the 18th-century philosopher <a href=\"http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/kant/\">Immanuel Kant</a>\u2019s claim that the proper response to art is a \u201cdisinterested\u201d attitude of contemplation.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"b398e1cf0fa7f9b216f752aff7a574adff2306e7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b398e1cf0fa7f9b216f752aff7a574adff2306e7/0_0_5000_3380/1000.jpg\" alt=\"My Bed by Tracey Emin, on show at Tate Liverpool.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"676\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">My Bed by Tracey Emin, on show at Tate Liverpool.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Richard Stonehouse/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There\u2019s something very interesting being suggested here about art, feeling, and reality. It seems only human, and very sane, to be less upset by art than we are by reality. Andy Warhol\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.moma.org/collection/works/79223\">car crash paintings</a>, which use silkscreened photographs of real car crashes, are powerful. But we would obviously be much more upset by an actual crash happening before our eyes. Picasso\u2019s <a href=\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guernica_(Picasso)#/media/File%3APicassoGuernica.jpg\">Guernica</a> is harrowing, but the horror of the actual bombing of Guernica in 1937 would have made it seem decorative. Any work of art is an interpretation of the world and not the world itself: a mirror, not the original thing.</p> <p>The readymade \u2013 that totally original modern art form in which an artist simply designates an object from the world as art \u2013 often appears an especially \u201ccool\u201d phenomenon, the triumph of reason over emotion. <a href=\"http://old.theartnewspaper.com/articles/An-interview-with-Marcel-Duchamp/29278\">Marcel Duchamp</a>, the first artist who simply \u201cchose\u201d readymade things as art, insisted that art should appeal to the brain instead of the heart. His art is a sustained exercise in irony and wit, a deliberate cooling of art\u2019s romantic heat. His <a href=\"http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/duchamp-the-bride-stripped-bare-by-her-bachelors-even-the-large-glass-t02011/text-catalogue-entry\">Large Glass</a> mocks sex as a sterile process; <a href=\"http://www.moma.org/learn/moma_learning/marcel-duchamp-bicycle-wheel-new-york-1951-third-version-after-lost-original-of-1913\">his readymades</a> mock the idea that art is a soulful act of agonised creation. </p> <p>So does this research prove the readymade is the ultimate triumph of art\u2019s emotional withdrawal from the world? It seems to provide a neurological basis for art that simply asserts it is art \u2013 and also for Duchamp\u2019s coolness. If art is the cooling of emotion, perhaps <a href=\"http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/duchamp-fountain-t07573\">Duchamp\u2019s 1917 urinal</a> really is the perfect embodiment of that Kantian disinterest, that disengagement?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"d5261cebfd8c9a88c207db1fc627fd1403db06e9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d5261cebfd8c9a88c207db1fc627fd1403db06e9/0_0_4256_2807/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jonathan Jones pictured with Duchamp\u2019s Fountain.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"660\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jonathan Jones pictured with Duchamp\u2019s Fountain.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nils Jorgensen/REX</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But I\u2019ve just been looking at a readymade that is all about feelings. Despair, loneliness, fear and melancholy stain Tracey Emin\u2019s bed. It is not removed in some cool way from reality: on the contrary, it rubs your face in reality. The Dutch scientists have touched a nerve but their definition of art is too narrow, too simplistic. As I say, it is human and healthy to see art as less intense than reality itself. Yet that does not mean art is cold or cannot move us. Rather, that removal from the world is the frame that allows art to make us see reality more clearly and with fresh emotion. </p> <p>Let\u2019s return to Warhol\u2019s car crashes. Warhol is an artist who apparently uses the readymade to distance himself from emotion. Taking readymade photographs from newspapers and magazines, he silkscreened them onto canvases drenched in monochrome colour. Thus a horrific car crash becomes a picture on the wall. This looks, at face value, like a chilly art of studied neutrality. And yet Warhol has a way of shocking you into a reaction: a detail, a shadow stirs your feelings and his paintings turn into acts of mourning. His art is insidiously tragic.</p> <p>The power of art is, precisely, to control emotion in order to focus it more intensely. A painting removes us from the mess of real life only in order to show us a more selective slice of it. That can make our feelings more organised, more aware \u2013 and deeper. This doesn\u2019t just go for paintings but the readymade as well. No good work of art stops at saying \u201cthis is art\u201d. The Dutch researchers have hit on something but it\u2019s only the start of our complex aesthetic responses. Art frees us from the chaos of life in order to return us to it with our senses awakened. Art \u2013 readymade or otherwise \u2013 is not a theorem. It is a dirty bed. <br></p>",

  "<p>Grime gigs draw an oddly eclectic crowd in 2016. The standing area of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/nov/15/wiley-30-minutes-interview\">Wiley\u2019s</a> show at Koko tonight is so full of rowdy pubescents that it looks like an episode of Sun, Sex and Suspicious Parents. Before the east London MC has even set foot on stage, they are \u2013 to the sounds of some quiet background music \u2013 clambering on their mates\u2019 shoulders and furiously crowd surfing. Standing above them, however, are upper tiers packed with head-nodding thirtysomethings. One of them even appears to have brought a child.</p> <p>This was always going to be a slightly unusual gig. The Godfather, Wiley\u2019s forthcoming album and first since grime\u2019s<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/mar/27/second-coming-of-grime-dizzee-rascal-wiley\"> recent renaissance</a>, was supposed to provide common cause between his new and old-school fans.

When Wiley\u2019s verse sees him declaring \u201cThey know I\u2019ve got Skeppy in my team\u201d, it doesn\u2019t come across as braggadocio, just pure, impressive fact.</p> <p>Guest spots come thick and fast until it\u2019s less like watching a concert, more like thumbing through a Rolodex of the finest MCs of a generation. As Chipmunk and JME take to the stage to pay homage to Wiley with cries of, \u201cHold tight, Wiley, the godfather of life, yeah?\u201d, you wonder whether he\u2019s pulled the wool over the crowd\u2019s eyes. Was this event intended less as a celebration of an album called The Godfather than a celebration of his status as grime\u2019s Don Corleone?</p> <p>The night draws to a close with JME leaping into the crowd to perform Man Don\u2019t Care, while a terrified-looking Wiley fights through a crush of furious moshers to sling protective arms around him. It\u2019s a special moment after which the gig kicks into the stratosphere. Circle pits open while the mic is passed back and forth between MCs and it becomes an old-school beats-and-bars freestyle session. </p> <p>For the last 15 minutes it\u2019s noticeable that Wiley doesn\u2019t even have a mic in his hand. It doesn\u2019t matter. He\u2019s made a statement louder than any sound system could deliver: when he puts out the call, grime\u2019s great and good still come running.</p>",

And I\u2019ve got all these babies, the house is full of babies. So all in all, I find it quite fatiguing.\u201d But it\u2019s the best job ever, right?

Harkin was working as an accountant in Salford, \u201cfinishing my work very quickly each month, and they wouldn\u2019t give me any more, so I spent a lot of time on the internet\u201d. He won a lot of QI competitions and was then offered a job. He didn\u2019t want to take it because he didn\u2019t like the sound of TV, so Lloyd offered him some accountancy on the side.

In the episode I saw being filmed, as in most I\u2019ve seen, Davies makes the show.

Like many on the bus, he was heading to his home village to claim compensation from the government, for those who lost their homes in <a href=\"https://viewer.gutools.co.uk/world/nepal-earthquake-2015\">last year\u2019s earthquake</a>. Inside sat his wife, Sano Bomjan, and nine-year-old daughter, Alisha.</p> <p> Alongside Lalik was his uncle, Juwralal Lama, himself a bus driver for 16 years. Juwralal was uneasy about the way the driver was handling the bus, which was massively overcrowded \u2013 about 80 people were on board the 35-seater vehicle. It was registered with a syndicate called the Araniko Transport Service Committee; the route, to a remote area called Madan Kudari, has been controlled by the ATSC for 22 years.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2016/aug/01/halve-traffic-accident-deaths-injuries-2020\">Halve traffic accident deaths and injuries by 2020: can it be done?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cI warned the others on the roof that the driver [was] not driving well,\u201d he Juwralal said. \u201cI told them to be careful and to be ready to jump if something happens.\u201d<br></p> <p>The bus stalled and began to slip back down the track. Juwralal leapt off the bus and pulled Lalik with him. \u201cPeople were crying for help, and then it slowly tipped over again and rolled down hill,\u201d said Juwralal. \u201cThere was a big blast, and then silence.\u201d He raced down the hill to help, but the bus had fallen so far it took him 15 minutes to reach the wreckage.<br></p> <p>\u201cThere were bus parts scattered everywhere,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople were shouting for help. There were lots of bodies. Some were headless. Some had lost their limbs. It was like a nightmare.\u201d Among the debris, he found the bodies of Lalik\u2019s wife and daughter.<br></p> <p>Twenty seven people were killed that day, in an accident all too familiar in Nepal, where hundreds have died or been severely injured in a summer of carnage on the country\u2019s roads. At least 334 people were killed between mid-June and mid-August, 58 more than in the same period last year, according to the police. The recent spike in accidents follows the bloodiest year yet on Nepal\u2019s roads \u2013 2,006 people died and more than 4,000 were severely injured in the 12 months from July 2015.</p> <p>More people have been killed on the roads in the last 10 years than in the country\u2019s decade-long civil war, in which an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/31/britain-accused-conniving-torture-maoists-nepal-civil-war\">estimated 16,000 people died</a>.</p> <p>In a speech to parliament last week, Nepal\u2019s prime minister, Pushpa Kamal Dahal, promised urgent measures to improve road safety. He said: \u201cI am very worried about the rising number of accidents. I have directed the Ministry of Transport to immediately launch reform programmes so that such cases will not occur again.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2016/feb/11/nepal-water-crisis-earthquake-rebuilding-cold-survivors\">Water crisis spells cold comfort for Nepal earthquake survivors | Pete Pattisson</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Careless driving, fake licences, overcrowded vehicles and poor roads are often cited as the causes of the road accidents, but recent attention has also focused on how the dangerous conditions can be exacerbated by bus syndicates: transport companies that control bus routes and bar other carriers from plying the same roads. </p> <p>Critics say the effective monopoly of the syndicates allows them to run limited services on old vehicles, leading to dangerous overcrowding. Dahal acknowledged the problem in his speech, saying: \u201cThis government is committed to breaking the net of syndicates.\u201d</p> <p>Leela Mani Poudyal, the government\u2019s former chief secretary who was recently appointed ambassador to China, said politicians were complicit in the syndicate system. \u201cThe members of the bus committees [syndicates] have strong connections with all political parties. They all join hands to protect the syndicate system,\u201d said Poudyal, who has been campaigning against the syndicates. \u201cThere are many reasons for the accidents, but the fundamental reason is the syndicates.\u201d</p> <p></p> <p> </p> <p>Juwralal also blamed the bus companies: \u201c[They] are profit-orientated, so they put as many people in the bus as possible. Because of the syndicate there is only one bus company [on this route], so people are forced to take that bus or they can\u2019t go \u2026 If another company tries to use those routes, they would do anything to stop them, even destroy their bus. If the government wanted to ban syndicates they could, but politicians and other leaders get money out of syndicates.\u201d</p> <p>It is a charge Jeet Bahadur Bharati, the recently retired president of the ATSC, denied. He argued that bus service monopolies are a good thing because they reduce the risk of accidents. \u201cWe have run a bus on this route for 22 years and this is the first major accident,\u201d said Bharati. \u201cThat bus was only five years old. The accident happened because of a fault in the bus. It happens sometimes.\u201d </p> <p>Syndicates can also guarantee that accident victims receive compensation, according to Bharati. \u201cIn Nepal, there are lots of accidents and the government has declared that 500,000 rupees [\u00a33,500] must be paid in compensation when someone dies,\u201d he said. \u201cSo if there are many deaths, a single owner cannot bear that cost.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/oct/25/nepal-earthquake-six-month-anniversary-children-orphans-people-traffickers\">Nepal earthquakes leave bitter legacy as children become quarry for traffickers | Sam Jones</a> </p> </aside>  <p>However, Poudyal said that in some cases other syndicates have used their power to bargain down the amount of compensation to be paid. \u201c[In the case of an accident] the bus committees will arrange compensation for the victims, but they influence the administration to weaken the compensation. The bus committees also try to minimise the legal action against their drivers, so the drivers become emboldened.\u201d <br></p> <p>Juwralal agreed: \u201cIf an accident happens, the bus owner doesn\u2019t have to worry about anything. The syndicate will cover everything. If the police take the driver\u2019s licence, the driver \u2026 just gives the traffic ticket to the syndicate [to sort out].\u201d</p> <p>The real price is paid by people like Lalik and his family. After the accident, he crawled down the mountainside and sat with the bodies of his wife and daughter for hours. \u201cMy daughter was really clever from a young age. She was talented \u2026 We had plans for the future,\u201d he said. \u201cLife doesn\u2019t turn out the way you imagine.\u201d</p> <p></p> <blockquote> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> </blockquote> <p><em>Additional reporting by Ishwar Rauniyar</em></p>",

Philip O\u2019Sullivan\u2019s new adaptation respects the play\u2019s central arguments between church and state, while deftly condensing it for a cast of seven.

Inspired by saints\u2019 voices, she aims to lead the French army to liberate Orl\u00e9ans and ultimately drive the English forces out of France. Her youth, peasant background and gender make her such an anomaly that the French leaders think she must indeed have been sent by God, otherwise she is inexplicable. Initially her unshakeable belief is galvanising. \u201cI never speak unless I know I\u2019m right,\u201d she says, fists raised, as Hogg successfully conveys both the irritation and admiration she arouses in others. <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>What becomes unpalatable to them, and later to the Inquisition who put her on trial, is her lack of deference to anyone. Her immodest adoption of men\u2019s clothing seals her fate. In a riveting performance by Philip O\u2019Sullivan, the urbane Inquisitor argues against heresy and fanaticism, defending the \u201cpainful duty\u201d of the Inquisition, and advising his colleagues to be on guard against their natural compassion towards a young, imprisoned woman.

It was a handsome, monolithic building that should have been turned into an art gallery, instead it was flattened to make way for a bland boutique hotel.</p> <h2>Best Instagram account</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Steve Cobby Instagram\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;instagram-media&quot; data-instgrm-version=&quot;7&quot; style=&quot; background:#FFF; border:0; border-radius:3px; box-shadow:0 0 1px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.5),0 1px 10px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.15); margin: 1px; max-width:658px; padding:0; width:99.375%; width:-webkit-calc(100% - 2px); width:calc(100% - 2px);&quot;&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;padding:8px;&quot;&gt; &lt;div style=&quot; background:#F8F8F8; line-height:0; margin-top:40px; padding:39.3055555556% 0; text-align:center; width:100%;&quot;&gt; &lt;div style=&quot; background:url(data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAACwAAAAsCAMAAAApWqozAAAABGdBTUEAALGPC/xhBQAAAAFzUkdCAK7OHOkAAAAMUExURczMzPf399fX1+bm5mzY9AMAAADiSURBVDjLvZXbEsMgCES5/P8/t9FuRVCRmU73JWlzosgSIIZURCjo/ad+EQJJB4Hv8BFt+IDpQoCx1wjOSBFhh2XssxEIYn3ulI/6MNReE07UIWJEv8UEOWDS88LY97kqyTliJKKtuYBbruAyVh5wOHiXmpi5we58Ek028czwyuQdLKPG1Bkb4NnM+VeAnfHqn1k4+GPT6uGQcvu2h2OVuIf/gWUFyy8OWEpdyZSa3aVCqpVoVvzZZ2VTnn2wU8qzVjDDetO90GSy9mVLqtgYSy231MxrY6I2gGqjrTY0L8fxCxfCBbhWrsYYAAAAAElFTkSuQmCC); display:block; height:44px; margin:0 auto -44px; position:relative; top:-22px; width:44px;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p style=&quot; color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px; margin-bottom:0; margin-top:8px; overflow:hidden; padding:8px 0 7px; text-align:center; text-overflow:ellipsis; white-space:nowrap;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.instagram.com/p/BIx09qTAomp/&quot; style=&quot; color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; line-height:17px; text-decoration:none;&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;A photo posted by Steve Cobby (@stevecobby)&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;time style=&quot; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px;&quot; datetime=&quot;2016-08-06T19:12:59+00:00&quot;&gt;Aug 6, 2016 at 12:12pm PDT&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;script async defer src=&quot;//platform.instagram.com/en_US/embeds.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>Steve Cobby is a musician and DJ who works all over the world, but when he\u2019s home he takes marvellous iPhone pictures of the city.

A group of influential citizens decided to refuse to let Charles I enter the city in 1642, sparking the <a href=\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siege_of_Hull_(1642)\">Siege of Hull</a>, which is seen as the first major action of the war.

  "<p>It was another sun-kissed afternoon in Huntington Beach this week, the seafront a playground. Surfers skimmed the waves. Volleyballers leaped and shrieked. Sunbathers splayed on the sand. Families paraded the boardwalk.</p> <p>Almost everyone had brown skin, though really they were white, just with tans. Those with permanent brown skin, Latinos, were mostly miles inland, on the other side of the 405 freeway. </p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s called life. In this world, no one gets along, so you hang out with your own kind,\u201d said Ruben Montanez, 54, in shorts and shades, perched on a bench. </p> <p>His heritage was Puerto Rican, but Montanez did not identify with, nor yearn to see, the absent Latinos. Huntington Beach was fine just as it was. \u201cWhen a neighborhood goes downhill, people leave.\u201d</p> <p>There is little chance the social services worker will feel forced to flee his home, at least not on account of Latinos.</p> <p>Orange County, a cluster of cities and freeways tucked between <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/los-angeles\">Los Angeles</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/san-diego\">San Diego</a>, is known for being white and politically conservative. California\u2019s Republican bastion, it helped launch Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan, who called it the place \u201cwhere all the good Republicans go to die\u201d. </p> <p>It led the state\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/politics/la-na-pol-latino-republicans-20160530-snap-story.html\">crackdown on illegal immigration</a> in the 1990s. A sub-group of <a href=\"http://www.vice.com/read/ed-templetons-huntington-beach\">neo-Nazi surfers</a> acquired notoriety for daubing swastikas on boards. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2014/feb/16/real-housewives-interview-scott-dunlop\">Real Housewives of Orange County</a>, a reality TV show, has bolstered the impression of a white enclave. </p> <p>In fact, over the past two decades, the county has become diverse to the point that whites are no longer a majority. They make up 44% of the population of 3 million, with Latinos comprising 34% and Asians 18%.</p> <p>But melting pot it is not. Most whites live in tracts that are at least 60% white, many of them coastal cities such as Newport Beach, Huntington Beach, Laguna Beach and San Clemente. The inland city of Santa Ana, in contrast, once predominantly white, is now 78% Latino.</p> <p>Economics explains much of this. Whites are wealthier and can afford pricey coastal real estate. Most Latinos cannot. Many observers have long suspected racism, too, but the evidence has been anecdotal. </p> <p>Now there is an academic study bolstering the case that racism does indeed fuel the segregation. Celia Lacayo, a postdoctoral scholar at UCLA\u2019s Institute of American Cultures, has published a report titled<a href=\"http://www.mdpi.com/2075-4698/6/3/25\"> Latinos Need to Stay in Their Place: Differential Segregation in a Multi-Ethnic Suburb</a>. </p> <p>It is based on in-depth interviews with 40 white residents in 2010, conducted by two white researchers Lacaya contracted to encourage candour. The random sample was aged 25 to 61 and mostly middle to upper class professionals involved in law, real estate, sales and marketing.</p> <p>A small sample, but with striking findings. The respondents \u201coverwhelmingly characterized Latinos and African Americans as culturally deficient, problematic and inferior\u201d, according to Lacayo. They used words like \u201ctrash\u201d, \u201cthird world\u201d and \u201cgangy\u201d. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"60291b5aff6f233b515401a9d64604a8fb60d60f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/60291b5aff6f233b515401a9d64604a8fb60d60f/0_48_640_384/500.jpg\" alt=\"Laurie Anaya, a Latina with a white husband, laughed off the fact that neighbors used to assumed she was the maid. \u2018The maids thought it too.\u2019 Her friend Marilyn Johnson, 48, said her children were half-Mexican and had never encountered racism in Huntington Beach.\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Laurie Anaya, a Latina with a white husband, laughed off the fact that neighbors used to assumed she was the maid. \u2018The maids thought it, too.\u2019 Her friend Marilyn Johnson, 48, said her children were half-Mexican and had never encountered racism in Huntington Beach.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rory Carroll/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Asians, in contrast, were deemed assimilated to white American norms and values. \u201cThe Asians come in and they\u2019re freaking motivated.

  "<p>JB Friday hacked at a rain-sodden tree with a small axe, splitting open a part of the trunk. The wood was riven with dark stripes, signs of a mysterious disease that has ravaged the US\u2019s only rainforests \u2013 and just one of the plagues that are devastating American forests across the west.<br></p> <p>Friday, a forest ecologist at the University of Hawaii, started getting calls from concerned landowners in Puna, which is on the eastern tip of Hawaii\u2019s big island, in 2010. Their seemingly ubiquitous ohi\u2019a trees were dying at an astonishing rate. The leaves would turn yellow, then brown, over just a few weeks \u2013 a startling change for an evergreen tree.</p> <p>\u201cIt was like popcorn \u2013 pop, pop, pop, pop, one tree after another,\u201d Friday said. \u201cAt first people were shocked, now they are resigned.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s heartbreaking. This is the biggest threat to our native forests that any of us have seen. If this spreads across the whole island, it could collapse the whole native ecosystem.\u201d</p> <p>Almost six years later and nearly 50,000 acres of native forest on the big island are infected with rapid ohi\u2019a death disease. Rumors abound as to its origin: did it emerge from Hawaii\u2019s steaming volcanoes? A strange new insect? Scientists still aren\u2019t sure of where it came from or how to treat it.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/sep/06/hawaii-marine-ocean-conservation-papahanaumokuakea\">Obama's Hawaii marine conservation area is just a drop in the ocean</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Lisa Keith, researcher in plant pathology at the US Department of Agriculture, said that when she analyzed the disease \u201cright away Dutch elm disease popped into my head\u201d.

Drought, disease, insects and wildfire are chewing up tens of millions of trees at an incredible pace, much of it driven by climate change. </p> <h2>\u2018Mountainsides dying\u2019</h2> <p>Forestry officials and scientists are increasingly alarmed, and say the essential role of trees \u2013 providing clean water, locking up carbon and sheltering whole ecosystems \u2013 is being undermined on a grand scale. </p> <p>California and mountain states have suffered particularly big die-offs in recent years, with 66m trees killed in the Sierra Nevada alone since 2010, according to the Forestry Service. </p> <p>In northern California, an invasive pathogen called Sudden Oak Death is infecting hundreds of different plants, from redwoods and ferns to backyard oaks and bay laurels. The disease is distantly related to the cause of the 19th-century Irish potato famine, and appears to have arrived with two \u201cTyphoid Marys\u201d, rhododendrons and bay laurels, said Dr David Rizzo, of the University of California, Davis.<br></p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re talking millions of trees killed, whole mountain sides dying,\u201d Rizzo said. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"86674e095888352cbfe1f5095bedf60037e1400b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/86674e095888352cbfe1f5095bedf60037e1400b/0_165_5137_3083/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Oozing from the bark of a live oak (Quercus) suffering from Sudden Oak Death.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Oozing from the bark of a live oak (Quercus) suffering from Sudden Oak Death.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Inga Spence/Getty Images/Visuals Unlimited</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Despite its name, the pathogen slowly saps the life from oaks over the course of two to five years, turning them sickly brown.

Garbelotto said researchers have found three distinct \u201csubspecies\u201d of the pathogen in the US \u2013 only one of which has escaped into the wild.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s a bit of concern here that maybe we\u2019re not doing enough to prevent introduction of other two lineages,\u201d he said. Authorities have quarantined 15 counties to keep infected plants from leaving, but Garbelotto fears that authorities lack the resources to do more.</p> <p>Native American tribes are helping Rizzo\u2019s research near Oregon, and Garbelotto\u2019s team developed <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://nature.berkeley.edu/garbelottowp/?p=2880\">a mobile app</a> that users can direct at a given tree to determine its risk for disease, and what they can do to protect it.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a little bit like talking about mosquito abatement and malaria,\u201d Garbelotto said of efforts to protect some trees by isolating them. \u201cYou try to reduce the number of vectors, eliminate immediate neighbors, a bit like putting a mosquito net around the tree.\u201d</p> <h2>\u2018Insect eruptions\u2019</h2> <p>Five <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/aug/13/california-el-nino-drought-rain-snowpack\">years of drought</a> in the west have not only starved trees of water but weakened their defenses and created conditions for \u201cinsect eruptions\u201d across the US, said Diana Six, an entomologist at the University of Montana. Bark beetles and mountain pine beetles, usually held in check by wet winters, now have more time to breed and roam. The latter have already expanded their range from British Columbia across the Rockies, to the Yukon border and eastward, into jack pine forests that have never seen the bug. </p> <p>The outbreak is \u201csomething like 10 times bigger than normal, I would argue a lot more than that,\u201d Six said. \u201cBasically a native insect is acting outside of the norm, because of climate change, and become an exotic in forests it\u2019s never been before.

They appear unstoppable: spraying each tree with insecticide would be time-consuming and made futile by rain, and pheromone-laced traps also appear ineffective. The university\u2019s arboretum has started collecting ohi\u2019a seeds in the face of a doomsday scenario that was recently unimaginable for such a common tree.</p> <h2>\u2018An ecological emergency\u2019</h2> <p>Scientists in Keith\u2019s lab have made some progress, finding that the fungal disease was part of the common ceratocystis family.

  "<p><strong>Debt</strong>: $75,000</p> <p><strong>Source</strong>: Student loans, medical bills, credit cards</p> <p><strong>Estimated years until debt-free</strong>: Free<br></p> <p>Even before I was fully conscious, before I\u2019d been loaded onto the stretcher in the middle of the road, I was thinking about money. \u201cI don\u2019t have health insurance,\u201d I protested as paramedics wrapped a neck brace around me, and shone a flashlight in my eyes. They asked me my name; I couldn\u2019t remember. \u201cTrauma November\u201d, my hospital wristband ended up reading. </p> <p>It had been a bad year. A nasty breakup snowballed into an unshakeable depression and the subsequent loss of my job. My bank account was empty, my credit cards maxed out. I did in fact have health insurance, albeit a poor plan \u2013 whatever I could afford to pay for while I skimped by on TaskRabbit gigs cleaning houses.</p> <p>And just when I thought things couldn\u2019t <em>possibly </em>get worse, they did, of course. I was hit on my bicycle by an SUV making a right-hand turn from a middle lane, while I cruised through a green light. I hit the vehicle and somersaulted two lanes of traffic, landing on my face next to a median.</p> <p>After that confusing ambulance ride, I woke up in a dingy ER hallway, my best friend holding my hair back as I tried to throw up. My busted face was sewn up, my lacerated liver monitored. Eight metal screws and a large metal plate were surgically implanted into my shattered elbow. The following few weeks coasted by in a haze of Dilaudid, and yet I somehow still interviewed for a job I wanted, my face a mess of stitches and bruises, my bandaged elbow hidden slightly by a theatrically-placed scarf, and my brain a jumble from Percocet. I didn\u2019t get it. </p> <p>The letters began filling up my mailbox before I\u2019d even got my elbow to bend past 90 degrees in physical therapy. Despite my measly insurance plan, my share of the medical bills from the wreck would end up totaling over $50,000. They came in small, teasing chunks \u2013 $250 here, $60 there. One itemized bill showed that a generic birth control test I\u2019d been required to take before surgery came to a whopping $267. </p> <p>After a while I couldn\u2019t read the letters anymore, and they teetered unopened in piles on the edges of my desk. Sometimes I couldn\u2019t even bring myself to open the mailbox, and my mailwoman would have to ring my doorbell to hand me armfuls of second and third notices from the three hospitals I\u2019d been to. </p> <p>The PTSD that accompanies such financial trauma still follows me around. It took two years for me to get a settlement from the driver\u2019s insurance company, during which I missed credit card payments, student loan bills and my rent checks bounced \u2013 three times. The day I picked up the settlement check from my lawyer\u2019s office my whole body shook as I walked the four blocks to the bank. The check was so large, it took four tellers to figure out how to process it. On the bus ride home I pulled up my bank account on my phone and looked at my balance. It didn\u2019t feel real, just a list of numbers lined up next to each other. </p> <p>That abstractness of numbers continued a couple days later when the full check cleared. I clicked around on my computer, paying off four credit cards, student loans, and writing checks to friends who\u2019d helped me buy groceries. The $50,000 in medical debts was negotiated and settled. And I was free.</p> <p>I\u2019d still be in debt today, with government-issued student loans and steep credit card interest that made it just impossible enough to every completely pay off a full account balance. So in some ways, getting hit by that SUV was one of the best things that\u2019s ever happened to me. My right arm will never function in the same way, but I\u2019ve moved on. Mostly.</p> <p>What hasn\u2019t changed, three years later, is the terror I get in the pit of my stomach when I run a credit card. My groceries are bagged and ready to go, and I know my bank account is okay. But still, that moment after I scan my card, before the cheerful \u201cAPPROVED\u201d pops up on the screen still makes my legs weak. If it takes long enough, I break out in a sweat and often completely stop breathing. It\u2019s the kind of trauma someone only knows if they\u2019ve seen \u201cDECLINED\u201d over and over and over again. <br></p>",

Robert Lowell and Paul Muldoon are among the tutelary presences: hints of <a href=\"https://www.poets.org/poetsorg/text/brief-guide-new-york-school\">the New York School</a> are mixed with the thrum of popular song, country and the Beatles included. The Learn\u2019d Astronomer, like other Robbins poems, makes the present participate in a \u201clearn\u2019d\u201d but direct conversation across cultures and periods through humour, intellectual range and the compression of its form.<br></p> <p> The poem\u2019s opening rhetorical question may implicate everyone, not only poets, in the romantic fallacy (\u201cHow long must we hymn the twinkling stars\u201d). In a comic-relativist proposition that the stars \u201care no more distant/than the glow-in-the-dark stickers adorning/the ceiling of my first girlfriend\u2019s boudoir\u201d, the vagueness is a studied impudence against both the measurer of distance and the meditator on vastness. Distance, after all, can refer to time as well as space. Try turning the idea the other way round: imagine Robbins\u2019s speaker had said that the glowing stickers of a girlfriend\u2019s \u201cboudoir\u201d were no more distant than the stars. It would become a conventional, if hopefully understated, romantic plaint about lost love or youth. </p> <p> Robbins is positioning \u201cthe twinkling stars\u201d of the popular poetic imagination as no more than verbal cliche \u2013 but the original \u201c<a href=\"https://www.poets.org/poetsorg/poem/when-i-heard-learned-astronomer\">learn\u2019d astronomer</a>\u201d who, with his charts and maths, drove Walt Whitman out of the lecture room to commune directly with the starry, starry night, is clearly not this poem\u2019s hero, either. The sceptical intelligence seems to see science as a contributor to the transcendental fallacy.</p> <p> From the irony of \u201cboudoir\u201d, the poem skips over the stanza break to give us what might seem more heartfelt, the sighting of the \u201cteenage planet\u201d. This is the cue for the second subject of the sonata-like structure. Engagingly, Robbins complicates the critique by presenting his speaker as a crazily precocious teenager. The anaphora is insistent across the stanza break: </p> <p> Even then, I was so skillful a lover<br>that when I said \u2018Life is wasted on the living,\u2019<br>the rivers ran for days with suicides.<br></p> <p>Even then, I knew the stars to be empty cans.<br></p> <p>An extended non-sequitur, apparently connecting an outbreak of mass suicide to the teenager\u2019s brilliance as a lover and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Restaurant_at_the_End_of_the_Universe\">his quotation from Douglas Adams</a>, may give the game away. The speaker is quarrelling with an earlier self.</p> <p> Teenage self-aggrandisement is seen off in the third stanza: there\u2019s no appetite for a reincarnation of the 16-year-old Red Bull-addicted gamer: \u201cI\u2019d loose adders on the man who claimed such power.\u201d (Adders are snakes, of course, but perhaps the word alludes here to the arithmetical addition mentioned by Whitman.) A nihilist who exaggerates his nihilism risks losing credibility, risks the nihilism itself. But the poem pushes on with the project: after the demolition of the constellations there\u2019s another cosmic shock in store for us regarding \u201cthe art of love\u201d. Robbins is a precise writer: he means \u201cplastic\u201d in its several adjectival meanings in \u201cplastic toy\u201d (not only \u201cmade of plastic\u201d, but malleable, and fake) and, in \u201ccaramel corn\u201d, combines two meanings of \u201ccorn\u201d. But note the oddity: it\u2019s not love that\u2019s buried in the sticky conglomeration, but \u201cthe art of love\u201d. We might need to think about Ovid (<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ch2qVvZ1Ug\">and/or Neil Diamond?</a>) as well as bad, fumbling sex before we move on. Rhyme, a subtle, flickering presence in parts of the poem, indicts intellectual clumsiness here in the judicious pairing of \u201cignorance\u201d and \u201cromance\u201d.</p> <p> The address to \u201cyou virgins\u201d echoes the old <em>carpe diem</em> motif but strongly implies that there is no day worth plucking. The last stanza is played at first for comedy: it\u2019s great fun to imagine love poets who \u201ccouldn\u2019t write their way out of a bag of kitty litter\u201d (an image that might relate distantly to that of the plastic toy in the tub of popcorn). The verse grows unruly and acquires an extra line, as if to accommodate all the \u201cjunk\u201d. That bodies and stars are one substance provides the reverse of consolation. The final lines perhaps equate the Safeway trolley with the poem, and the creation of the poem with acts of wheeling and recycling. In this case, \u201cI\u2019m pushing\u201d becomes a performative statement. It reminds us that we humans manipulate our material, whether it\u2019s poems and stars. They can, at least temporarily, become what the writer wants them to be, his comfort, his joke, his terror.</p> <ul> <li>Michael Robbins is the author of two collections, Alien vs Predator and The Second Sex.

  "<p>Since the mid-2000s, Pro Evolution Soccer (now formally abbreviated to PES) has resembled one of those once-great footballing names now reduced to scraping an existence in the lower divisions \u2013 a Leeds United or Sheffield Wednesday, say. In the early 2000s, though, PES\u2019s annual tussle with EA Sports\u2019 Fifa was one of the games industry\u2019s great rivalries. PES was the option for the purists, its stimulating fast-paced and highly tactical gameplay providing a thrilling simulation of the beautiful game. But Fifa had the flashy presentation and its expensive official licence, and from 2008 onwards a much-improved on-pitch experience, allowing it build a seemingly unassailable lead. As a result, Fifa became one of the UK\u2019s best-selling games, PES stagnated.</p> <p>However, last year\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/aug/07/pro-evolution-soccer-2016-football-game\">PES 2016 represented an impressive comeback</a>, thanks mainly to vastly improved graphics and physics brought by a switch to the Fox game engine, which also powered Metal Gear Solid V. Happily, PES 2017 builds considerably on that sudden improvement, addressing many (though not all) of the criticisms that still dogged its predecessor. Compared to the commercial might of Fifa 2017, it\u2019s still an underdog of Leicester City proportions, but in some fundamental areas it outshines its brash, flashy rival.</p> <p>PES 2017\u2019s standout attribute \u2013 which harks right back to the glory days of the series \u2013 is the sheer football feel it offers. Passes go exactly where you aim them, at the speed you specify. Loose balls ping around convincingly: you must work hard to get them under control, and your adrenalin levels are just as likely to be spiked by a scrappy period of penalty-box pinball as by an immaculate volley from a perfectly executed cross. </p> <p>The game\u2019s AI is exemplary. Forward players, for example, are wont to point when they embark on runs, rendering the through-ball pass much more useful than in Fifa, and central defenders steadfastly refuse to charge upfield like headless chickens when opposition attackers encroach on your penalty area. There\u2019s an incredible amount of fine-control over tactics, which can easily be switched according to match situations \u2013 you can even instruct your players to ape Barcelona\u2019s tiki-taka style or Jurgen Klopps\u2019 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2015/oct/16/jurgen-klopp-liverpool-gegenpressing-borussia-dortmund\">gegenpressing</a>, with potentially hilarious results if their close-control skills fall short of those possessed by Messi et al.</p> <p>The most notable area which drew criticism in PES 2016 but has been comprehensively fixed in this year\u2019s offering is the game\u2019s menu system. Previously, it was a scrappy mess, with key screens buried in odd places, but in PES 2017, it is sufficiently logical that it doesn\u2019t stick out as a weakness. You still find some rather odd terminology when trawling the menus (as is often the case with titles translated from Japanese), but at least the key elements are easily accessible now.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f2143f7888ffdaf67b1e4876e8518962d9616a6a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f2143f7888ffdaf67b1e4876e8518962d9616a6a/69_81_1664_999/1000.jpg\" alt=\"PES 2017 has Barcelona among its official team licenses but a lot of sides are present with fictitious names and kits\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">PES 2017 has Barcelona among its official team licenses but a lot of sides are present with fictitious names and kits.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Konami</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>However, its surface sheen still can\u2019t match that of FIFA 2017. Players, at least, have recognisable faces, running styles and body shapes, but they don\u2019t look as convincing as Fifa\u2019s. And the licensing problem persists: PES 2017 does have a Barcelona licence this time around, but the only officially licensed Premier League teams are Arsenal and Liverpool \u2013 which means other sides get weird vaguely indicative new monickers (Tottenham Hotspur, for example, become North East London in the game), and the kits and club crests are mere approximations of their real-life counterparts. You can, however, edit them to your heart\u2019s content, or even download impressively accurate kits created by the PES community if you\u2019re savvy enough. But this remains a barrier to entry for consumers who just want to play as their favourite teams straight out of the box.</p> <p>The main mode, Master League, offers an impressive approximation of real football, with some additions for 2017 that crank up the realism, such as a transfer window that develops hour by hour on the last day and a decent short-term loan system. But its scouting system is a bit hit-and-miss and fiddly. The management side of Master League naturally, pales in comparison to the likes of <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/dec/05/how-football-manager-changed-the-game\">Football Manager</a>, but it doesn\u2019t noticeably lag behind Fifa 2017\u2019s equivalent. There\u2019s a feature called Live Updates which brings squads into line with the summer\u2019s transfer activity, but if you leave that untouched before creating a Master League, you can start the transfer window with the squad that ended last year\u2019s season, which is great if you\u2019re not happy with the players your club bought.</p> <p>Online, PES 2017 impresses, too \u2013 it\u2019s fuss-free, and lets you play in leagues and cups against your mates or random opponents without any evidence of matching problems or lag. But the online side of the game is more or less identical to last year\u2019s, as is the Become a Legend mode, which lets you pursue a career as a single player and is handy for novices wanting to learn the full intricacies of the control system. However it feels a bit me-tooish \u2013 you suspect it\u2019s there because Fifa has a similar option.</p> <p>And there are still a few areas in which Fifa has the upper hand. PES 2017\u2019s stadia feel generic and lacking in atmosphere, as does the build-up to any given match \u2013 Fifa\u2019s bombast in those regards is absent. And the commentary soon grates: Peter Drury and Jim Beglin are hardly a dream team, but you end up feeling a bit sorry for them since PES 2017 has far too small a database of commentary phrases, so repetition soon sets in.</p> <p>However, in the areas that really matter \u2013 on the pitch \u2013 this year\u2019s model is by far the best version of PES yet, and easily matches its rival. Explore PES 2017\u2019s outer limits, and it\u2019s easy to detect some raggedness around the edges. But in a way, that isn\u2019t a bad thing \u2013 it\u2019s always been part of the charm of the series. Picking PES 2017 over Fifa 17 feels like backing the plucky underdog, and that narrative is very much in the psyche of the football supporter.

Rosberg is still playing it cool</h2> <p>Despite having seen his early-season championship lead of 43 points turned to a 19-point deficit before Spa, then two points after Monza and now an eight-point lead again <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/sep/18/nico-rosberg-singapore-grand-prix-formula-one\" title=\"\">with his third win on the trot</a>, Nico Rosberg remains absolutely steadfast in his refusal to be drawn into considering whether the title finally has his name on it this year. His weekend, bar biffing the barriers after locking up on ageing tyres in first practice, could not have gone better, his 200th grand prix yielding a first win in Singapore but more importantly a real blow to Lewis Hamilton, who could not match him in qualifying or the race.</p> <p>His public pronouncements, however, while winning at the start of the season, being hauled back by Hamilton and now back on top, have been firmly of the only-taking-it-one-race-at-a-time variety. When informed that in seven out of the past eight seasons the driver who won in Singapore has gone on to take the title, the mask did not slip. \u201cA statistic like that, it\u2019s not something that I focus on, at all. It doesn\u2019t have any importance to me,\u201d he deadpanned.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/sep/18/nico-rosberg-singapore-grand-prix-formula-one\">Nico Rosberg wins Singapore Grand Prix to lead F1 world championship</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Prodded further, he was asked whether the three wins in a row and taking the lead again excited him or whether he should be given the nickname \u2018Mr Cool\u2019. \u201cNo,\u201d flatlined Mr Cool. \u201cI\u2019m just excited about winning the race today. I\u2019m not excited about any of those other points. Sorry.\u201d</p> <p>Sports psychologists everywhere will be applauding this dedication to their science, even if it means we are denied a bit more verbal sparring between he and Hamilton but, to be fair, it is working for him. Six races remain in what promises to be a fantastically tight run-in, can he keep a lid on it, or might there be a Keegan-esque boiling-point? Don\u2019t hold your breath.</p> <h2>2. Safety must still come first</h2> <p>The sight of a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/19/marshal-runs-safety-singapore-grand-prix-restart-on-track\" title=\"\">marshall on track</a> during the restart after Nico H\u00fclkenberg had crashed out following a clash with Carlos Sainz off the grid, was terrifying to behold. They do a sterling job at circuits around the world at all levels of motorsport and must venture on to the track but seeing anyone in proximity to cars hitting full whack is unacceptable. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/jul/17/f1-driver-jules-bianchi-dies-from-injuries-sustained-in-crash-at-japanese-grand-prix\" title=\"\">Since Jules Bianchi\u2019s accident and subsequent death</a>, safety has dominated the agenda in F1 \u2013 Lewis Hamilton was testing the Halo cockpit safety device under the lights of Marina Bay this weekend \u2013 but there should be no let up in ensuring that concern extends to everyone who works at circuits worldwide, whether paid staff or, as is the case with the vast majority of dedicated marshals, entirely voluntary. When the circuit was called as clear for racing the marshall was still running across the track.</p> <p>The FIA has stated that the man in question had been told to go out by a circuit representative after the official FIA procedure of race control giving the track clear notification three times before restarting the race. It added that its procedures were not properly executed by the clerk of the course. \u201cWe take this very seriously,\u201d the FIA stated. \u201cEverything will be done to ensure this does not happen again.\u201d</p> <p>Rosberg, leading the restart, had come closest to the marshal. \u201cIt was not a nice experience to see someone running across the track when I\u2019m arriving at 300kmh,\u201d he said. \u201cSo I just made sure I drove through safely, but it was a bit of a hairy moment because I don\u2019t think he saw us coming.\u201d Some aspects of racing simply cannot have danger entirely removed but injury or death through poor procedure, lax discipline or insufficient communication would be unforgivable. Singapore was a wake-up call that must reverberate up and down the sport for the good of everyone involved \u2013 on track and off.</p> <h2>3. Ferrari make-ups and downs</h2> <p>Sebastian Vettel could not have hoped for more at Marina Bay once it became clear he was going to have to start from the back of the grid due to a broken right suspension in qualifying. Ferrari took advantage of the failure, fitting new power unit components and a new gearbox with the usual pointless penalties and he made the most of it. On a two-stop strategy and using the new ultra-soft tyres he had not worn in qualifying he charged through the field on a track where passing is difficult and slotted into a very respectable fifth place \u2013 behind his team-mate Kimi Raikkonen, who had started in fifth. \u201cWe sure had a good strategy today,\u201d he said. And indeed, for him, they had.</p> <p>For Raikkonen however, the Scuderia\u2019s calls, in a season peppered with poor decisions, were once again in question. The Finn had taken third on track from Hamilton, slipping up the inside after the British driver locked up and had six seconds on him when Hamilton pitted for the final time. Raikkonen was on the soft rubber with 16 laps to go at that point and the team could have left him out \u2013 leaving Hamilton with around 28 seconds to make up but also then having to overtake.</p> <p>As Daniel Ricciardo\u2019s ultimately fruitless tilt at Rosberg proved, it would have been a tall order and Ferrari were already second-guessing themselves afterwards. When the team principal, Maurizio Arrivabene, was asked if had been the right choice, he said: \u201cTo be 100% sure, you have to look at the data.\u201d The inquest will continue. \u201cWe took a decision based on our data, and now the exercise to do is verify if our data was right,\u201d added Arrivabene. The title is long gone but they are only 15 points behind Red Bull\u2019s second place and cannot afford to drop the ball again.</p> <h2>4. Hamilton must fight from the front</h2> <p>Mercedes leave Singapore with a first and third, not quite the one-two they would have wanted but nonetheless a result with which they are hugely pleased. Their car was very poor at Marina Bay last year \u2013 a second a lap off the pace \u2013 and they went away and worked at the problem.</p> <p>\u201cPerhaps the severity of our lack of performance last year opened up a new way of thinking,\u201d said the executive director, Toto Wolff. It was certainly the fillip they needed. Rosberg was sixth-tenths clear in qualifying and until Red Bull\u2019s tyre gamble during the race had the pace well within his control. They had pushed the car to the edge, the brakes were on their limit from the off, but proved they could make the car work on a track to which it was not previously suited. Hamilton\u2019s problem, however, was in finding the right set-up. Lost time with a mechanical problem in practice cost him and third in qualifying was the result. It left him following Ricciardo and showed again that the F1 W07 does not work to the optimum in dirty air \u2013 a problem considerably exacerbated when trying to manage brake wear.</p> <p>\u201cOnce you get into turn one in third the likelihood of winning is very, very low,\u201d he said. \u201cI was thinking of trying to improve my position but immediately I was having these brake problems. Soon after the safety car I could see them pulling away and there was nothing I could do about it.\u201d Out front his team-mate, in clean air, had the same issues but to a much lesser extent. Hamilton was disappointed with his weekend, but knows that from the same position he is usually unassailable. Qualifying on the front, then, is his first task for the next round in Malaysia and then backing it up with a clean getaway. He has dropped places four times this season with slow starts from pole \u2013 from first to sixth at Monza. Mercedes have no fix for how the car performs in dirty air so Hamilton must dictate from the front.</p> <h2>5. New boss goes home smiling</h2> <p>The new chairman of the Formula One Group, but let\u2019s call him what he is \u2013 the sport\u2019s new boss, was in Singapore to see his first F1 race since he was appointed by Liberty Media <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/sep/07/f1-liberty-media-8bn-takeover-deal-agreed-bernie-ecclestone\" title=\"\">after their \u00a36bn takeover</a>. The mustachioed 62-year-old was smiling happily in the paddock and treated to a race that evolved over almost two hours to present a thrilling finale with what is always in Singapore, a visually glorious spectacle. Wolff, believed the sport had done itself proud. \u201cI saw Donald [Mackenzie, chairman of former F1 owners CVC] on the podium and I said: \u2018You sold too early\u2019,\u201d said Wolff. \u201cThere is a great show going on. You saw Formula One at its best today. You have good football games and bad football games and today was a good football game.\u201d</p> <p>But Chase Carey was here to do business as well. Having already met with leading teams in the UK, he was seeing others in the paddock in Singapore and then promptly announced that the days of the Bernie Ecclestone dictatorship were over. \u201cYou cannot make everybody happy all the time, but you\u2019ve got to understand what everybody wants and then find a path,\u201d he said. \u201cSure, that is not a task for a committee, as committees tend to become bureaucratic \u2013 but there also can\u2019t be a dictatorship \u2013 even if probably here they are used to it.\u201d Ecclestone is contracted as CEO of F1 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/sep/07/bernie-ecclestone-claims-he-will-be-kept-on-after-f1-takeover-liberty-media\" title=\"\">for three more years</a> but it seems increasingly unlikely he will see them out. Did he have to work with Carey? \u201cThe only thing I have to do is die and pay my tax,\u201d Ecclestone said. \u201cShort of that I don\u2019t have to do anything.\u201d</p> <p>Further cause for optimism came from the new leader as he also reiterated his desire to push F1 in the US, a fanbase the sport needs to be part of. \u201cThere is a big untapped audience in the US. Formula One is a great premium brand and that means to me that you want to be at a location like Los Angeles, New York or Miami,\u201d he said.</p>",

Meanwhile, on issues of primary importance to voters, like the future of the famished NHS and the collapse of social care for the elderly and chronically ill, parliament has proved ineffective.</p> <p>Yet Labour, since its Keir Hardie origins, has been committed to parliamentary democracy. It has always believed, unlike some socialist parties in central and eastern Europe, that MPs are accountable to the people not the party.

He was, I imagine, speaking about the Labour factions. But why not about cooperation between the centre-left parties? These share common values of democracy, social justice, hatred of racism and intolerance, and in most cases want to stay as close to the EU as the referendum result allows \u2013 for instance membership of the European single market, support for the European court of human rights (often endorsed by Corbyn), and working together on security, defence and international crime.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/18/jeremy-corbyn-labour-make-up-or-break-up\">After Jeremy Corbyn wins, Labour has to make up or break up | Zoe Williams</a> </p> </aside>  <p>I do not think a new party combining the centre-left is likely in the next few years.

In 1995, there were around 29,000 Bewick\u2019s in Europe; by 2010, the figure had dropped to 18,100 and the numbers have continued to decline.<br></p> <p>There are multiple factors involved, say experts, but the main one is illegal shooting. \u201cAbout a quarter of Bewick\u2019s have shot in them, when we x-ray them at Slimbridge [a wetland centre in western England],\u201d Dench has said. \u201cBut even at that high rate is doesn\u2019t seem to be solely responsible for their decline.\u201d</p> <p>A loss of wetlands for the swans to land on, disturbance of habitats along the route and more predation by Arctic foxes, a proliferation of power lines that swans may strike in mid-flight, and climate change are all considered further factors. </p> <p>In 2012, as the numbers of Bewick\u2019s swans reached an alarmingly low level, an international action plan was agreed by countries that lie beneath the birds\u2019 migration path.

However, <a href=\"http://www.skepticalscience.com/co2-plant-food.htm\">reality is far more complicated</a> than the oversimplification of \u2018CO2 is plant food.\u2019 Unlike in the controlled environment of a greenhouse, the increasing greenhouse effect on Earth causes temperatures to rise and the climate to change in various ways that can be bad for plant life. We can\u2019t control all the other variables the way we can in a greenhouse.<br></p> <p>So far, as contrarians like Rupert Murdoch love to point out, the plant food effect has won out. Earth has become greener in recent decades (although <a href=\"http://www.skepticalscience.com/news.php?f=ridley-murdoch-lomborg-greenwash-global-warming\">that trend may now be reversing</a>). The situation is not unlike a human diet \u2013 at relatively low calorie levels, more food is beneficial. But as calorie intake continues to rise, at a certain point it\u2019s no longer benefiting the human body. More food is good, but only up to a certain point, as <a href=\"http://www.who.int/nutrition/topics/obesity/en/\">the global obesity epidemic</a> makes clear.</p> <h2><strong>The experiment</strong></h2> <p>The Stanford scientists set up 132 plots of flowers and grass in California and introduced varying levels of carbon dioxide, temperature, water, and nitrogen. The scientists conducted the experiments over 16 growing seasons between 1998 and 2014. They found that only higher nitrogen levels resulted in higher plant productivity, while higher temperatures caused it to decline. <br></p> <p>While this experiment was specific to California grasslands, other studies have similarly undermined the \u2018more CO2 is great\u2019 myth. For example, <a href=\"http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=10850600268344775265&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=0,5\">a 2012 paper</a> found that higher temperatures are detrimental to French corn yields.

Prosecutors have also publicly named her in court documents, instead of protecting her privacy. The Guardian does not usually identify victims of sexual assault.</p> <p> After growing up in Washington state, Buckmaster moved to Portland, Oregon, when she was 13, she said. She has been in and out of prison over the last two decades for a range of nonviolent offenses stemming from her struggle with drug addiction.</p> <p>She said she was a survivor of child sex abuse, and explained that it had had a lasting impact on her relationships.</p> <p>In 2012, at Coffee Creek, the only state prison for women in Oregon, Buckmaster met Balzer, a 42-year-old guard who she said repeatedly coerced her into sex and exploited her until her release in 2014. She spent some of her sentence in the prison\u2019s mental health unit, records show.<br></p> <p>\u201cHe was in a position of power \u2026 and took advantage of someone who wasn\u2019t mentally stable,\u201d said Buckmaster, adding that her past abuse made her vulnerable to his advances. \u201cI didn\u2019t have anybody.\u201d</p> <p>According to the Washington County district attorney\u2019s office, Balzer \u201cengaged in sexual conduct\u201d with Buckmaster and gave her perfume samples, and the abuse only came to light after she was released, when she mentioned the \u201crelationship\u201d to a staff member at a facility where she was living.</p> <p>Prosecutors charged Balzer with felonies of custodial sexual misconduct and supplying contraband. Buckmaster testified in front of a grand jury last year, and Balzer was indicted in November. On the <a href=\"http://www.oregonlive.com/washingtoncounty/index.ssf/2016/09/accuser_in_prison_sex_case_jai.html\">day of his arrest</a>, he posted $2,000 bail and was let go.<br></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtRWmU_Py_g\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/JtRWmU_Py_g?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>By law, there is no such thing as consensual sex between guards and inmates since staff have <a href=\"https://www.themarshallproject.org/2015/06/17/preying-on-prisoners#.5y8qOXHox\">complete control</a> over the lives of prisoners. Any sexual activity is considered criminal.</p> <p>\u201cThe inmates have no power,\u201d said Betsy Rawls, Buckmaster\u2019s lawyer. \u201cIf they deny [sexual advances], they\u2019re going to have to see them every day.\u201d</p> <p>Buckmaster said she was desperate for a sense of safety and comfort in prison and that it took her time after her release to realize how Balzer had manipulated her.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m tired of blaming myself for somebody else\u2019s actions,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Buckmaster recently struggled with relapse, and when her parole officer and other law enforcement officers allegedly had trouble locating her, deputy district attorney Dan Hesson requested a so-called \u201cmaterial witness warrant\u201d for her. Prosecutors wanted her in custody until trial.</p> <p>Buckmaster said she had been making progress in her recovery and had always planned to participate in the trial. But her promises didn\u2019t matter. Washington County circuit judge Charles Bailey approved prosecutors\u2019 request, and on 16 August, she returned to jail.</p> <h2><strong>A \u2018perverse\u2019 use of jail</strong></h2> <p>Criminal justice reform activists have fought back against the detention of material witnesses, arguing that it is unjust to imprison people who are not accused of crimes. By law, the holds are only supposed to be used in <a href=\"http://www.salon.com/2013/08/17/are_prosecutors_taking_advantage_of_material_witness_orders_partner/\">extraordinary circumstances</a> as a last resort, and advocates argue that it is particularly cruel to detain witnesses who are victims.</p> <p>\u201cThis is a perverse way of using our criminal justice system and using our jails,\u201d said Julia Yoshimoto, program director of the Oregon Justice Resource Center\u2019s Women in Prison Project.</p> <p>Buckmaster and her attorneys have said she would show up for trial and would be willing to wear an ankle bracelet and also complete a deposition in advance.</p> <p>But Hesson, the deputy district attorney, said jailing her was the only feasible option.</p> <p>Citing the fact that Buckmaster contacted Balzer after she was released, Hesson claimed in a filing that she was \u201ccomplicit in perpetuating the illicit relationship between she and the defendant\u201d. He further claimed that \u201cMs Buckmaster has led a life of crime\u201d and \u201cwasted considerable public resources\u201d when prosecutors were unable to locate her.</p> <p>Brent Goodfellow, another attorney representing Buckmaster, scoffed at the claim: \u201cIt\u2019s expensive for Washington County to house her.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to run,\u201d Buckmaster said. \u201cHe\u2019s going to pay for what happened \u2026 If I have to be accountable for my actions and for my past, he has to be accountable for his.\u201d</p> <p>Balzer\u2019s attorney declined to comment.</p> <p>Reached by phone, Hesson confirmed that his office had not provided Buckmaster with any victim support services while she was in jail. He also repeatedly declined to comment on whether prosecutors considered her a \u201cvictim\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cIt is a terrible idea that she is in jail,\u201d Hesson said, \u201cbut I can\u2019t find a better alternative.\u201d</p> <h2>Counting the days</h2> <p>Advocates said they were concerned that the Balzer case could have a chilling effect on victims reporting sexual violence in prisons \u2013 especially in Oregon, which has a documented history of problems.<br></p> <p>At Coffee Creek, at least eight employees have been convicted of sexual misconduct cases involving inmates since 2004, <a href=\"http://www.oregonlive.com/washingtoncounty/index.ssf/2016/09/accuser_in_prison_sex_case_jai.html\">according to the Oregonian</a>. The paper <a href=\"http://www.oregonlive.com/politics/index.ssf/2012/04/abuse_of_women_inmates_at_oreg.html\">reported</a> that the state has paid $1.2m to<strong> </strong>17 victims who said prison employees abused them.</p> <p>Studies have also shown that, like Buckmaster, many who get caught up in the criminal justice system have histories of trauma \u2013 nearly <a href=\"http://www.csosa.gov/newsmedia/factsheets/statistics-on-women-offenders-2014.pdf\">six in 10 women</a> in state prisons have previously experienced physical or sexual abuse.</p> <p>\u201cThe system often retraumatizes them,\u201d said Emily Austin, director of advocacy services for the California Coalition Against Sexual Assault.</p> <p>These days, Buckmaster said, she struggles to cope when she feels triggered or depressed. She said she has dreams of building a treehouse with her boyfriend, living somewhere serene and quiet, starting a family, and is counting the days until the trial, scheduled for 4 October.</p> <p>Often, though, she just paces back and forth in her cell.</p>",

But this development suggests that they are also unwilling to let countries like the US cherry-pick the most educated refugees, and leave behind the rest. </p> <p>\u201cWe believe that the most vulnerable need to be helped before others,\u201d a senior Turkish official told the Guardian this week.</p> <p>Some of those affected have nevertheless questioned whether vulnerability can be determined by the standard of one\u2019s education. </p> <p>Loreen and Shero, a Syrian Kurdish couple whose home was destroyed in Aleppo, applied for resettlement in the US in April 2014, along with their three children.

As a result, both work as manual labourers on the black market for about half the minimum wage.

After two days, the kids were playing in the streets, again people came past, walking rather than in a van, and yelled at her: \u2018Come with us, we will give you money.\u2019 And she recognised one of them [from the previous attempt].\u201d</p> <p>Several other families interviewed by the Guardian have been left in a similarly vulnerable position. Heba, a 34-year-old charity worker, was told in July that her application, along with that of her husband and baby daughter, had been canceled because of her degree in English literature from Aleppo University.</p> <p>\u201cWe have no notion of what to do,\u201d Heba said, before outlining how the situation for refugees in Turkey falls short of what is pledged under the 1951 refugee convention. \u201cWe are unhappy in Turkey, we have no rights. We can\u2019t leave. My husband has no work permit. My baby was sick, she had a temperature, so we went to the government hospital, but they would not treat her. A while ago I went to hospital in a critical situation, I was very dizzy. They refused to help me or receive me.\u201d</p> <p>Fatima, a 25-year-old electrical engineering student, was approved for resettlement in March, along with her brother, sister, and parents. They were told they would be sent to Chicago, but before their flight was booked, their application was suddenly canceled because at least one of them had a degree.</p> <p>Fatima speaks four languages and wants to develop electronics. But like other interviewees, she queried whether their educational attainment made her family any less vulnerable in Turkey. </p> <p>\u201cIn Turkey, we\u2019ve never had a job contract or a work permit,\u201d Fatima said. \u201cYou need to work 13 hours a day just to eat.

Turkish, US, UN and ICMC officials would not comment on the figure. The Guardian has met with members of a group of affected refugees who represent more than one thousand people whose resettlement has been blocked. Some of them were bound for Canada or Europe.</p> <p>Should the situation continue, some of those affected said they may try to reach the west by boat, highlighting how the absence of formal means of resettlement can encourage more irregular means of migration.</p> <p>\u201cIf we can\u2019t leave to the US, we will go by boat to somewhere,\u201d said Fatima. \u201cDefinitely we can\u2019t stay here.\u201d</p> <p><em>Additional reporting by Eiad Abdulatif.

  "<p>When we were young we often resented the way in which older people would lay down the law and make it clear that they knew how things were.

  "<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/russia\">Russia</a>\u2019s new parliament will be overwhelmingly loyal to the Kremlin, after elections marked by a record low turnout threw up few surprises.</p> <p>With more than 93% of the votes counted on Monday morning, the United Russia party, backed by Russia\u2019s president, Vladimir Putin, and led by its prime minister, Dmitry Medvedev, had won 54% of the vote. The other three parties to clear the 5% barrier required to make it into the Duma are all broadly loyal to the Kremlin line. United Russia will take more than three-quarters of the 450 seats in the Duma.</p> <p>The communists, and the far-right nationalists of Vladimir Zhirinovsky\u2019s Liberal Democratic party took about 13% of the vote, while the liberal Yabloko party and the opposition <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/sep/13/russian-opposition-party-regional-election-kostroma\">Parnas</a> garnered miserly returns. Parnas was the party led by Boris Nemtsov, a former deputy prime minister who was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/mar/02/boris-nemtsov-never-know-who-killed-moscow-vladimir-putin-russian-opposition\">shot dead</a> outside the Kremlin last year. Before the elections, many had criticised the liberal opposition for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jun/23/russia-opposition-infighting-parliamentary-elections\">failing to unite </a>on a single ticket. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/mar/02/boris-nemtsov-never-know-who-killed-moscow-vladimir-putin-russian-opposition\">Who killed Boris Nemtsov? We will never know</a> </p> </aside>  <p>A new, mixed voting system was introduced for Sunday\u2019s election, in which voters chose both a party and individual candidates, with half the MPs coming from party lists and half from the direct voting. United Russia candidates also dominated the direct voting, meaning that in the end they will control 76% of the seats in the new Duma, giving them the two-thirds majority required to change the constitution. The projected 343 seats for United Russia is an increase of more than 100 from the previous parliament.<br></p> <p>In recent years, the Duma has been a pliant body with little real voice, and the two MPs out of 450 who had pursued an independent line have not been re-elected. One, Ilya Ponomarev, is living in exile while the other, Dmitry Gudkov, was beaten by a United Russia candidate in a Moscow district.</p> <p>Turnout in the election was just 47%, the lowest in the history of modern Russia. In major cities, the turnout was even lower, with just 28% of eligible voters making it to the polls in Moscow. </p> <p>In Crimea, which was voting in the first parliamentary elections since annexation by Russia in 2014, turnout was also low. Only 40% of Crimeans had cast their ballots with two hours of voting remaining, and the turnout was on course to be lower than the last time Crimeans voted in Ukrainian parliamentary elections. After the widespread euphoria over rejoining Russia two years ago, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jan/19/crimeans-still-tigerish-over-split-with-ukraine\">life has not improved in the way many Crimeans had hoped</a>, which has led to discontent and apathy similar to that in other parts of Russia.</p> <p>The national average was boosted by some provincial regions, where officials are known to demand local residents, and especially public service workers, come out to vote.</p> <p>\u201cThe situation is tough and difficult but the people still voted for United Russia,\u201d Putin said on Sunday evening. United Russia was described as \u201cthe party of crooks and thieves\u201d by the opposition leader <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/mar/06/alexei-navalny-russian-opposition-is-not-deterred-by-boris-nemtsov\">Alexei Navalny</a>, but although many Russians have disdain for corrupt local leaders, United Russia remains electable due to its association with Putin and a lack of viable alternatives.</p> <p>There were some violations reported on the day of the vote, including cases where what appeared to be blatant ballot stuffing was captured on camera. However, most election observers noted that the elections were much cleaner than the parliamentary elections five years ago. Then, multiple violations prompted tens of thousands of Muscovites to come out on to the streets for a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/feb/04/anti-putin-protests-moscow-russia\">season of protests</a> that lasted several months and rattled the Kremlin.</p> <p>While the day of the voting was cleaner and some opposition candidates were allowed on to the ballot, Kremlin critics say the vote is skewed from the outset given the partisan nature of state television and access to resources. However, few expect a new season of protests, after a crackdown in 2012 dissuaded many opposition-minded Russians from dissent. </p> <p>The next big election in Russia is the presidential vote, scheduled for early 2018. Putin is expected to stand and win another six-year term. By the end of that term, he would have ruled Russia for 24 years.<br></p>",

And it\u2019s very amusing \u2013 put that man on all shows like this.</p> <p>You can\u2019t live entirely off power though. He sends out a party \u2013 including Olly and Lydia \u2013 to look for water. They fail miserably, get lost and thirsty, and end up pressing the emergency SOS button; Bear\u2019s safety team comes to rescue them less than 24 hours into the adventure. It\u2019s all too much for Olly, who really wanted to prove \u201cthat I\u2019m not a complete idiot and I\u2019m actually quite good at stuff and not this stupid kind of pink-wearing guy that I think a lot of people think I am\u201d. Not much change then, in the thinking. Never mind, though, there\u2019s always tomorrow.</p> <p>So the following day, Olly and Lydia are sent out to find water again. \u201cIf someone gave me a bag of, like, brand new makeup right now, I\u2019d say: \u2018No thank you, I\u2019d rather have a bottle of water,\u2019\u201d says Lydia. That\u2019s how serious&#xa0;it\u2019s got. Again they fail miserably, get lost, and thirsty, end up pressing the emergency SOS button, and the safety team comes to rescue them, less than 48 hours into the adventure. And then point them to the spring, and the nice beach with en-suite pooing beach. Well, otherwise they would have perished, and that would be a shame.</p> <p>I\u2019m thoroughly enjoying this. But I\u2019m looking for more input from the others next week \u2013 such as Labour selfie queen Karen Danczuk and rugby hunk Thom Evans, for example. Someone needs to start a revolution, topple you-know-who before he gets out of control. I\u2019m sure the CIA would help. There are bays all over the place: they could turn one into Guant\u00e1namo, cage him in the sun.

There is something not quite right in the United team at the moment, beyond the problems that Mourinho identified, which included an acknowledgement that they are too passive defensively at times and, in the case of some individuals, unable to take responsibility when results and performances are poor. The midfield seems to lack the right balance, with Paul Pogba and Marouane Fellaini imposing figures but not controlling and dictating games. There were times against Watford when Wayne Rooney was dropping deeper than the pair of them, for reasons only he knows.

He was rather more subdued throughout this latest thrashing, surveying most of his team\u2019s surrender at Crystal Palace with arms folded across his chest and disgust etched on his brow, before mustering a furious kick at the air when the hosts registered their fourth of the day. Even a manager desperately trying to behave cannot bottle up his frustration for ever. Stoke City are bottom of the table, have lost four on the bounce and have not even led in a league game to date this season. They are already saddled with a goal difference of minus 11 having conceded four in three of the last four games. In truth, they could count themselves fortunate that this latest battering was not even more emphatic. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/18/mark-hughes-stoke-city\">Mark Hughes calls on Stoke City to turn around disastrous early form</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Defenders preoccupied with the directives against grappling in the penalty area have forgotten they do have to muster a tackle or track their man. At the moment they are tentative and nervous, panic-stricken or just careless. At least the manager recognised the need to remind them of the basics. Each defeat is damaging Hughes\u2019s reputation at present. Stoke are a patient club and, as Alan Pardew reminded the watching world, they are overseen by an experienced manager of proper pedigree. But the need to improve has become urgent. Theirs would normally appear a winnable run in the months ahead: there are games against Tony Pulis\u2019s West Bromwich Albion and Sunderland, Hull City and Swansea City, West Ham United and Bournemouth, and then Watford and Burnley taking them to mid-December. Only a trip to Old Trafford appears daunting on paper. Yet, if they maintain the sloppiness which so undermined them in south London, they will not give themselves a chance in any of the above. This team\u2019s forte used to be their rugged defence. They need to revert to type. <strong>Dominic Fifield</strong></p> <p><strong>Injuries</strong> Crystal Palace: James Tomkins (knee, withdrawn as a precaution but likely to be rested against Southampton on Wednesday).

A shame, in many respects. Aitor Karanka and his team were ultimately on the receiving end as human error ignited not only Everton\u2019s performance but the quality of the contest and atmosphere after a sluggish opening in every aspect. Indignation, and Middlesbrough had their share when referee Lee Mason levelled things up by missing Ashley Williams\u2019s high boot on V\u00edctor Vald\u00e9s for Gareth Barry\u2019s equaliser, is part of a game that is supposed to get one\u2019s blood up. On Saturday, it enabled Everton to show their mentality has altered under Ronald Koeman. \u201cEverton made it hard for us after that and they showed their quality,\u201d Marten de Roon said. \u201cThey showed how much quality some teams have in the Premier League. In 10-15 minutes we lost the game. This was the best team we have played this season.\u201d One poor decision was sufficient for Everton to fold on several occasions last season but they have displayed resilience in the early weeks of Koeman\u2019s reign, coming from behind in two of their four league wins. Another notable factor at Goodison was the Everton manager constantly ordering his players to remain composed and not overcommit on the counter-attack once they had taken a 3-1 lead. \u201cThe way we controlled the second half was outstanding,\u201d Koeman said. <strong>Andy Hunter</strong><br></p> <p><strong>Injuries</strong> Everton: Lukaku (foot, unknown).

Apart from being heavily involved in the creation of Alexis S\u00e1nchez\u2019s two goals, Walcott scored a good one himself \u2013 the 100th of his career \u2013 while his crosses created virtually all Arsenal\u2019s best chances. Visiting fans were not completely content, with some disputing the quality of his contribution. There were moments when Walcott briefly disappeared, forfeited possession or picked the wrong pass, but that is what wingers \u2013 even the very best \u2013 do. Theirs is a difficult job, mistakes inevitably come with the territory. The important thing is that Walcott\u2019s end product was, in Wenger\u2019s words, \u201cvery efficient\u201d. There is a reason why Arsenal\u2019s manager has started him in all five top-flight games this season. \u201cTheo\u2019s very dangerous,\u201d Wenger said. \u201cHe goes behind defences.\u201d <strong>Louise Taylor</strong></p> <p><strong>Injuries</strong> None.<br></p> <p><em>\u2022 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/17/hull-city-arsenal-premier-league-match-report\">Match report: Hull City 1-4 Arsenal</a><br>\u2022 </em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/18/hull-city-mike-phelan-manchester-united-physically-stronger-arsenal\"><em>Mike Phelan to be confirmed as Hull City manager</em></a></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"41abdf0821fcb1096367cdffb6098ae087c2279a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/41abdf0821fcb1096367cdffb6098ae087c2279a/0_54_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Theo Walcott is often criticised by Arsenal fans but shone in the 4-1 win at Hull.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Theo Walcott is often criticised by Arsenal fans but shone in the 4-1 win at Hull.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Price/Arsenal FC via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>5) Potent Slimani proves he is no slouch</strong></h2> <p>It will take some adjustment to become used to the idea of a \u00a328m bargain, but if Islam Slimani delivers on the promise of his Leicester City league debut he will be just that. The Algerian scored two headed goals to help the champions to victory here and headers are his stock-in-trade. He scored seven for his former club Sporting Lisbon this year alone, and now a pair for his new club showcased not just good movement and power but an ability to adapt to a changing situation (viz: Jamie Vardy\u2019s cheeky backheel flick for the second). But aerial prowess may not be the main reason the champions broke their transfer record for Slimani. As Claudio Ranieri pointed out after the match, he shares the Foxes\u2019 penchant for intensive running and is no slouch pace-wise. He will add more technical prowess in the final third, too. Slimani laid on chances for Marc Albrighton and Danny Drinkwater in the first half and had the ability to drift with the ball across the edge of a packed penalty area, waiting for his moment. Another player who can make something out of nothing will, of course, distract teams from watching Vardy and Riyad Mahrez. As the game went on, Slimani\u2019s fellow countryman particularly felt the benefit. \u201cSlimani played well but he also linked well with Vardy and Mahrez,\u201d Claudio Ranieri said afterwards. \u201cWe bought him for these characteristics.\u201d <strong>Paul MacInnes</strong></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/gallery/2016/sep/18/the-dozen-the-weekends-best-premier-league-photos\">The Dozen: the weekend's best Premier League photos</a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong>Injuries </strong>Leicester City: Kasper Schmeichel (concussion, will miss League Cup match with Chelsea on Tuesday).

The manager might have offered weary acceptance of the defeat due to the high-end talent of Kevin De Bruyne, Raheem Sterling, Fernandinho and company. But, no. He was cross his side had not managed to disrupt them and sent a message that he, like Pep Guardiola, is on the drive for constant improvement. Howe said: \u201cMy nature is always to analyse and reflect that we could have done something different. You only get one shot at it and we didn\u2019t make a good fist of it.\u201d Pushed if he could admire City, Howe said: \u201cI can do that when I\u2019m watching the game and they\u2019re playing someone else. There\u2019s no appreciation of how good they are. It\u2019s just focusing on our team and how we can stop them and get a foothold in the game.\u201d It is precisely this attitude that may allow Howe to reach the very top himself. <strong>Jamie Jackson</strong></p> <p><strong>Injuries</strong>: None.</p> <p><em>\u2022 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/17/manchester-city-bournemouth-premier-league-match-report\">Match report: Manchester City 4-0 Bournemouth</a></em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5fd19cc1388f86c969371619b872c6b6126b6f43\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5fd19cc1388f86c969371619b872c6b6126b6f43/30_24_1780_1296/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Kevin De Bruyne was imperious against Bournemouth, continuing his excellent start to the season.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"728\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Kevin De Bruyne was imperious against Bournemouth, continuing his excellent start to the season.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Peter Powell/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>7) Pickford shines but may be harmed by defeats</strong><br></h2> <p>On another day and with another goalkeeper, Sunderland could have conceded half a dozen against Tottenham. Jordan Pickford, who was in possession of the ball more than any other visiting player at White Hart Lane, undoubtedly has all the attributes to become one of the best keepers in the country. However, is facing a deluge every week going to be good for him in the long run? The defenders in front of the 22-year-old are so poor and never too far away from committing a cheap error that his reputation will be embellished when he saves his team time and again. Yet he could badly do with a game where he does not have to be in action every couple of minutes. Being part of a losing side, no matter the impressive nature of his performances, is not a good look. And for all the praise he is receiving, a defeat is never good for confidence. <strong>Alan Smith</strong></p> <p><strong>Injuries</strong> Tottenham: Demb\u00e9l\u00e9, Dier (both hamstring), Kane (ankle).

It is the prime reason Cesc F\u00e0bregas has been left on the substitutes\u2019 bench, but when they were being overrun by Liverpool at Stamford Bridge on Friday night and badly in need of some control, the one midfielder that could provide it remained sitting in the dugout until six minutes from the end. There are several issues for Conte to iron out but it is clear he does not have the personnel required to execute his desired system to a high level. Arsenal are up next for Chelsea on Saturday evening and the Spain midfielder will, of course, relish an opportunity to get one over on his former club. With Nemanja Matic far from resounding, it may be time for the Spaniard to be given a first start of the campaign. <strong>AS</strong></p> <p><strong>Injuries</strong>: None.</p> <p><em>\u2022 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/16/chelsea-liverpool-premier-league-match-report\">Match report: Chelsea 1-2 Liverpool</a></em></p> <h2><strong>9) Absentee\u2019s experience could be Taylor-made for Swansea</strong></h2> <p>It does not get any easier for Francesco Guidolin. After defeat by Southampton, Swansea City face an unforgiving few weeks with a double-header against Manchester City next up before matches against Liverpool and Arsenal. It is now that Guidolin could do with leaning on the experienced heads within his group, including their talisman Gylfi Sigurdsson, the captain Jack Cork, \u00c0ngel Rangel and the estranged left\u2011back Neil Taylor. The defender has been a consistent performer over the past six years in south Wales \u2013 and for his country at Euro 2016 \u2013 but was omitted from Guidolin\u2019s matchday squad at Southampton after being substituted during the first half against Chelsea. Taylor, though, will be given another opportunity to impress against City on Wednesday, according to his manager. \u201cIn this period I prefer Stephen [Kingsley],\u201d said the Italian, who was forced to bat way questions as to whether his players respected him enough in his post-match press conference. \u201cKyle Naughton can play left-back as well so I do not need another left-back on the bench. If Neil against Manchester City shows me other or different things, I\u2019m ready to change. It\u2019s not a problem between me and him. I spoke with him yesterday and he is ready for Wednesday.\u201d Taylor will not change everything of course but his experience could prove invaluable in coming weeks. After flitting between formations and personnel, a return to the basics is needed for a team who have not tasted victory since 13 August, the first day of the Premier League season. It is usually at this point that Swansea would look to Ashley Williams, the leader they lost to Everton in the summer. <strong>Ben Fisher</strong></p> <p><strong>Injuries</strong> Southampton: Jay Rodriguez (leg, will miss League Cup match with Crystal Palace on Wednesday).

The Belgium international missed out on the European Championship after spending much of last season on the bench and, having previously spoken of his pride to play for the Red Devils, the omission must have hurt. He gave one of the most economical performances in recent memory against a diabolical West Ham on Saturday, scoring twice and assisting the other two goals despite having only 39 touches of the ball. That was fewer than every West Ham outfield player with the exception of Simone Zaza, who was hooked at half-time. Chadli can flourish at the Hawthorns and become their go-to player. Is it beyond the realms of possibility that he could finish the season in double figures for goals? <strong>AS</strong></p> <p><strong>Injuries</strong>: None.<br></p> <p><em>\u2022 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/17/west-bromwich-albion-west-ham-premier-league-match-report\">Match report: West Bromwich Albion 4-2 West Ham United</a></em><br></p>",

  "<p> Sir Alexander Morison stands tall and sombre with his top hat in his left hand and a white handkerchief in his right. His eyes are grey and slightly sunken, his lips thin, his face long and gaunt. He seems marked by the sadness of his profession. For Morison was an \u201calienist\u201d, a 19th-century doctor of mental illness, at London\u2019s infamous asylum Bethlem Hospital, popularly known as Bedlam, whose history and cultural significance are explored by the Wellcome Collection\u2019s new exhibition <a href=\"https://wellcomecollection.org/bedlam\">Bedlam: The Asylum and Beyond</a>. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/gallery/2016/sep/19/taking-over-the-asylum-art-made-at-bedlam-and-beyond-in-pictures\">Taking over the asylum: art made at Bedlam and beyond \u2013 in pictures</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The man who painted this portrait of Morison there in 1852 was one of his most pitiable patients. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/jonathanjonesblog/2015/jun/17/richard-dadd-victorian-artist-bedlam-mental-illness-fairies\">Richard Dadd</a> had been marked out for a brilliant career but this gifted young painter became confused on the way back from a trip to the Middle East in 1842, thinking he was receiving messages from the ancient Egyptian gods and had uncovered a plot by the pope to have him killed. In 1843, he met his father on a country lane in Kent and stabbed him to death because he thought he was the devil. Dadd spent the rest of his life in Bedlam and at Broadmoor. In both institutions, his doctors provided him with materials and space to paint \u2013 contradicting modern caricatures of the Victorian asylum as a brutal \u201cmadhouse\u201d. </p> <p>Dadd\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.nationalgalleries.org/collection/artists-a-z/d/artist/richard-dadd/object/sir-alexander-morison-1779-1866-alienist-pg-2623\">portrait of his doctor</a> is an eerie masterpiece whose take on reality is captivatingly askew. His eye for detail is exact, even miraculous \u2013 but is it a little too exact for comfort? The shape of Morison\u2019s shiny black hat, held upside down to reveal the yellow lining inside, engrosses him. So do the figures of two tiny women in the background who are totally out of proportion to the tall, thin doctor. Dadd is fascinated by Morison. He sees him as a heroic, lonely pillar of compassion. Yet with his wild white hair the alienist looks like he could just as easily be an inmate as a doctor. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8e9ecf56320d1ebc2d77bd945fddc4353a7a56ed\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8e9ecf56320d1ebc2d77bd945fddc4353a7a56ed/59_0_2205_2755/800.jpg\" alt=\"The 1890 etching L\u2019Homme \u00e0 la Pipe by Van Gogh depicts the doctor who treated the artist after leaving Saint-R\u00e9my asylum.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The 1890 etching L\u2019Homme \u00e0 la Pipe by Van Gogh depicts the doctor who treated the artist after leaving Saint-R\u00e9my asylum.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy Trustees of the British Museum</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>More than 150 years later, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/video/2013/nov/21/images-bedlam-art-therapy-bethlem-hospital-video\">Bethlem Royal Hospital still exists</a>, although it has changed its location, architecture and attitude to mental illness. Today it is home to an artist called Mr X who makes amazing trucks and vans out of cardboard. In a video, he tours Bromley in his homemade vehicles, driving into a filling station and on the main road. No one bats an eyelid. Most significantly he drives in and out of the hospital gates, for Mr X is not a prisoner. </p> <p>The Wellcome\u2019s exhibition tells a story of changing attitudes to mental illness from the middle ages to now, using Bedlam hospital as both an example and a metaphor of the rise and fall of the asylum. Why were \u201clunatics\u201d locked away from the 17th century onwards, when they had not been before, and why have asylums been abolished since the 1960s? </p> <p>I think that\u2019s a fair summing up of the exhibition\u2019s intentions. I hope it is. This is a serious, absorbing subject, and the curators bring together a rich variety of documents, photographs, books, films and art. Yet Bedlam is a confused and complacent exhibition that touches on huge issues but fails to follow through \u2013 often adopting a semi-ironic pose.</p> <p>The revolution in thinking about mental illness in the 1960s, for instance, is encapsulated by some controversial books in a transparent case. What exactly is anyone going to learn about the history of psychiatry by looking at the cover of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madness_and_Civilization\">Michel Foucault\u2019s Madness and Civilisation</a>? Either you\u2019ve read it, in which case looking at it in a vitrine is a bit irrelevant, or you haven\u2019t, and you need to know what it actually argues \u2013 not to mention the debates it provokes. </p> <p>Even sillier is an exhibit consisting of a drug company\u2019s brochure illustrated with paintings by Salvador Dal\u00ed. It\u2019s too flip as a way of dealing with anything, let alone the lives of millions of people afflicted by mental illness and its treatments. Worse, these superficial hints at vast cultural changes and misrepresent the history of psychiatry. Radicals including <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/1984/06/26/obituaries/michel-foucault-french-historian.html\">Foucault</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/sep/02/rd-laing-mental-health-sanity\">RD Laing</a> are equated with the evolution of pharmaceuticals (there\u2019s a jar of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2013/aug/03/will-self-psychiatrist-drug-medication\">Largactil</a> on display) when they represent diametrically opposed attitudes.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"2291281a30bb7ebc30c30bf6b2aea99cbc8b5745\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2291281a30bb7ebc30c30bf6b2aea99cbc8b5745/43_0_4065_5016/810.jpg\" alt=\"Epitaph of My Poor Jack, Squirrel II, 1834, by Bedlam resident James Hadfield.\" width=\"810\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Epitaph of My Poor Jack, Squirrel II, 1834, by Bedlam resident James Hadfield.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jonathan Stokes/Bethlem Museum of the Mind</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It\u2019s much more poignant to see that it was health minister <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/0098/feb/09/obituaries.mikephillips\">Enoch Powell</a> who announced a much more sceptical approach to asylums in Britain in the early 1960s and so helped spearhead new attitudes to mental illness. I doubt if old Enoch was a big reader of Foucault\u2019s theories. So what was his thinking? The exhibition does not tell us.</p> <p>The history of asylums is a vast theme, of course, but this exhibition fails to make sense of it. Bedlam is both a real place and a modern myth. The Wellcome could have created a powerful exhibition by concentrating on this dark shadow on the story of London. If it stuck to its title and shone a light into Bedlam, it would be much more moving. Instead, it throws in loads of other stuff \u2013 including plenty of second-rate contemporary art \u2013 and ends up being vague, diffuse and empty. </p> <p>The show is at its most compelling when it reveals the sad, strange world of London\u2019s historic asylum. A view drawn by JT Smith in 1812 shows the wall of Bedlam seen from the street. Barred windows induce a shudder. Sheets hang out of them \u2013 relics of escape attempts? The strangest detail is a man bent double on the street outside. Is he mad or sane? This haunting print suggests that London\u2019s streets are as eccentric and idiosyncratic as the closed wards of Bedlam itself. </p> <p> This suspicion that \u201cmadness\u201d does not respect the walls of Bedlam has long haunted art and literature. In texts of Restoration plays exhibited here, there are jokes about London being one big Bedlam. In <a href=\"http://www.soane.org/collections-research/key-stories/rakes-progress\">William Hogarth\u2019s picture The Rake in Bedlam</a> \u2013 shown here only as a print \u2013 inmates of a dank chamber exhibit various symptoms of insanity, from a man dressed as the pope to the half-naked, shaven-headed Rake who stares fixedly at the floor, fallen into a \u201cmelancholy\u201d madness of paralysing despair. (The paintings of Hogarth\u2019s Rake\u2019s Progress are in Sir John Soane\u2019s Museum.) Hogarth depicts two well-dressed ladies who have come to gawp at the lunatics: they seem the most foolish of all. A society that laughs at the mad is itself mad. Hogarth was a social reformer, and he is pointing out one of the grotesque abuses \u2013 letting in paying voyeurs \u2013 that made Bedlam notorious.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"dde40cb80cdfca10572ba554cd97917ef4d96185\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dde40cb80cdfca10572ba554cd97917ef4d96185/0_0_5996_4002/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Madlove \u2013 Designer Asylum, 2016, by Benjamin Koslowski and James Christian.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Benjamin Koslowski and James Christian\u2019s asylum design for the Madlove \u2013 Designer Asylum project.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Thomas SG Farnetti/Wellcome Images/Courtesy the Vacuum Cleaner and Hannah Hull</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In the book <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2016/aug/05/vincent-van-gogh-myths-madness-and-a-new-way-of-painting\">Madness and Civilisation</a>, which the Wellcome invites us to judge by its cover, Foucault imagines a medieval world where madness was celebrated and included in the community, until the asylum locked unreason away. Yet mental illness is real. Richard Dadd really killed his father. Another artwork here is a <a href=\"http://museumofthemind.org.uk/gallery/artwork/ldbth879\">sweet drawing of a pet squirrel</a> by <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Hadfield\">James Hadfield</a>, who was sent to Bedlam after trying to assassinate George III at the Drury Lane theatre. Hadfield was the first person found not guilty by reason of insanity in a British court \u2013 a remarkable advance in liberalism. It was lucky for him, because regicides could be hung, drawn and quartered. In Bedlam, the squirrel kept him company, and he mourns it in his 1834 drawing. </p> <p>It\u2019s not easy living in the supposedly sane world. Is the vanishing of the asylum a true liberation? In the exhibition\u2019s final, utopian exhibit, a group of people with troubled mental health have designed the ideal asylum. Everyone sleeps in a private treehouse. There\u2019s a collective bakery and a forest for daydreaming in. It is a place of refuge yet also of perfect freedom. If Donald Trump is banned from its TV screens, I\u2019ll check in.</p> <p>\u2022 <a href=\"https://wellcomecollection.org/bedlam\">Bedlam: The Asylum and Beyond</a> is at Wellcome Collection, London, until 17 January 2017.</p>",
  "<p>Queen Victoria was prescribed cannabis for period pains, and 19th-century American doctors used it for everything from anorexia to sexual problems.

There is good evidence to use cannabis products or \u201cnatural\u201d cannabis, they said, for all these conditions \u2013 and moderate evidence for use in sleep disorders, fibromyalgia and post-traumatic stress disorder. The&#xa0;evidence came from a review based on 20,000 references \u2013 although, in places, they were quite generous in their rating of the evidence.</p> <p>A systematic review of the same question \u2013 the benefits and adverse effects of medicinal marijuana \u2013 <a href=\"http://jama.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=2338251\" title=\"\">was published in the Journal of the American Medical Association</a> (JAMA) last year with similar conclusions \u2013 but found the evidence overall to be weaker, and not there at all for anxiety.</p> <p>The evidence shows that cannabis does relieve chronic pain, but the Home Office has already said in response to this latest report that cannabis \u201cis a harmful drug which can damage people\u2019s mental and physical health\u201d. Yet Nice says it works in the treatment of MS. And the JAMA review, which had higher standards of evidence than the latest report, says that cannabis benefits people with chronic pain or spasticity due to MS. It adds that there is some evidence it helps to improve weight gain in HIV infection, and relieves insomnia, nausea and vomiting due to chemotherapy. There is no data on long-term side-effects \u2013 psychosis is the most feared. Typical side-effects include drowsiness, nausea, paranoia, sweating and euphoria. There is no solid research comparing \u201cnatural\u201d with \u201cmedicinal\u201d cannabis, but the research suggests similar benefits for pain and spasticity. So it does work \u2013 but the law says you can\u2019t take it.</p>",

The musicians also listened to a lot of Off The Wall-era Michael Jackson while recording \u2013 post-the 1977 watershed, but it counted because Quincy Jones used more musicians in the studio than machines. Some of the equipment employed \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/jul/06/acid-house-music-innovator-charanjit-singh-dies-aged-74\">Roland Juno-106 synths</a>, say \u2013 were also of later, early-80s vintage, but still, the gently burbling feel suited the conceptual time frame. Slowly Disappear is lilting dance music with a light synth wash and a wan ambience. Leshem says it\u2019s designed for \u201ccasinos and love boats\u201d. Like everything on this ennui-laden downtempo album it sounds like a hit song you vaguely recollect hearing at a discotheque on a foreign holiday as a kid: \u201cLike a seven-inch that you find in a store and you don\u2019t really know the band,\u201d says Leshem. Always Gonna Give Myself to You is disconcertingly pretty, like <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/nov/15/ariel-pink-pom-pom-4ad\">Ariel Pink</a> working with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2011/mar/03/philadelphia-philly-soul-1970s\">Gamble &amp; Huff</a>.

  "<p>I ended up working in parliament more by accident than design. While at university I started helping a local MP simply to gain some work experience. If it hadn\u2019t been for a well-timed maternity leave at the moment I graduated, I wouldn\u2019t have had the opportunity to make the step up.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/12/secret-life-anaesthetist-surgery-doctor\">The secret life of an anaesthetist: if surgeons are the blood, we are the brains</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Most parliamentary assistants have followed a well-trodden path: public school, PPE at Oxbridge, parliament.<strong> </strong>Those without that background, such as me, have to find a different way in. I haven\u2019t got a politics degree, I just started with a part-time job in the constituency and worked hard to prove that I was capable of joining the parliamentary office.</p> <p>By far the best part of working in the Westminster village is the feeling of being at the beating heart of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics\">politics</a>, which for most of us there is an all-consuming passion. This outweighs the monotony of the work itself. Parliamentary assistants are fairly low in the food chain, certainly below special advisers or office managers, and many I know are simply glorified tea carriers doing mind-numbing admin work from 8am until 6pm.</p> <p>It\u2019s sometimes how I feel too, perhaps after I\u2019ve sealed my thousandth envelope of the day, but generally I\u2019m more fortunate. I have a very good relationship with my boss and colleagues. I don\u2019t have fixed office hours, and provided I get the work done I\u2019m given a generous degree of autonomy and responsibility. The downside is that I never get a real break from work. In the 24/7 world of politics, I can be called upon at any time. During election campaigns, our whole lives are engulfed by work.</p> <p>Many people believe politicians, and by extension their staff, are detached from reality, but I don\u2019t agree with that. Working in an MP\u2019s office is like having a window into the lives of the most desperate and underprivileged people in society. An MP is often the last port of call for people who have been abandoned or ignored by everyone else. We always do all we can to help, but we\u2019re not miracle-workers, and there are limits to the influence MPs have.</p> <p>Of course, people\u2019s frustrations can spill over, and dealing with the fallout is the hardest part of the job. Assistants are always first in the firing line. The fact that email and social media have made offensive communication apparently more acceptable \u2013 and the fact that politicians in particular are seen to be fair game \u2013 means we have to deal with all kinds of mindless abuse \u2013 even the odd death threat.</p> <p>Then you get the conspiracy theorists who write 20-page letters to you every day about how the government\u2019s controlling everyone. I\u2019m afraid to say that after a while these go straight into the bin unopened. But if they decide to phone, there\u2019s no escape. I once spent an hour talking to a woman who was convinced MI5 was after her, so had locked herself up in a Travelodge. In many ways the saddest thing about the job is realising how widespread mental health issues are in society and how little is done to support the people affected.</p> <p>One element of what makes this job unique is the place of work itself, the Palace of Westminster. Despite the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/08/mps-must-leave-houses-of-parliament-4bn-repairs\">accurate reports that it\u2019s falling to bits</a>, it is still a truly magnificent building \u2013 full of living, breathing history, with a peculiar but fascinating set of traditions, codes and customs. The place is a labyrinth of corridors and passageways, secret rooms and locked doors. The moment I received my Commons pass I felt like I was being given the keys to Hogwarts.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Some politicians feel they can behave as they like in the 'compound' of parliament, without fear of consequence</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The most interesting part of my job, even though it\u2019s a fairly menial task, is to visit the <a href=\"http://www.parliament.uk/mps-lords-and-offices/offices/commons/departments/\">Table Office</a> to deliver the member\u2019s written questions, which takes me through dark, hidden passageways and stairwells to a room where you can look right into the Commons Chamber, which I get a real buzz from.</p> <p>But not only is it in disrepair, the whole place is woefully ill-equipped for the 21st century. The Wi-Fi is agonisingly slow, the heating comes and goes as it pleases, and the toilets are pretty grim. It\u2019s certainly not as palatial as you\u2019d expect.</p> <p>But it\u2019s still a workplace for thousands of people, and the daily peculiarities and incidents are really what make the job so interesting. One day you might be sitting opposite a cabinet minister in the canteen as he spills soup on his trousers, then walk past the PM on your way to a committee room.</p> <p>Despite politics being combative and occasionally nasty, the atmosphere in parliament is normally friendly, though the EU referendum and recent leadership contests have tested this. MPs\u2019 offices are scattered about the estate almost at random. Every corridor contains an assortment of different political parties, which means you can have a chat and a joke in the lifts perfectly happily with people without necessarily knowing who they work for. Most of my personal impressions of politicians stem from whether or not they have held a door open for me.</p> <p>A strange consequence of this is that some politicians seem to feel they can behave as they like once they\u2019re in the \u201ccompound\u201d of parliament, without fear of consequence. This probably explains the disturbingly <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/sep/03/parliamentary-network-pornography-websites-figures\">high number of occasions pornography is accessed from parliament</a>. Other MPs seem to be remarkably cavalier with their reputations. Last year I saw a group of male MPs, whom I now know all to be married, making very blatant passes at their parliamentary assistants at a Christmas party.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/05/secret-life-music-business-truck-driver-tom-jones-driving\">The secret life of a truck driver: at the sharp end of what the EU means, I want out | Anonymous</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Alcohol plays a very active role in the daily life of parliament. Researchers traditionally drink in the downbeat <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/mar/15/parliamentary-bars-what-really-like\">Sports and Social club</a>, which looks like your average pub and is located behind the bins, where the waste from the dozen or so restaurants is emptied.

Infamously, it is where <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/mar/15/eric-joyce-arrest-mp-police\">Eric Joyce punched someone</a>.</p> <p>My job is fascinating and I\u2019m lucky to have it. But the novelty will wear off eventually. At the end of the day, it is largely an admin job. And the pay, while good for a graduate, takes you only so far in London, so most parliamentary assistants usually move on to something new after a while.</p> <p>But when I move on, I know that it will have been a unique experience, and that later in life, when I take my kids to London, I\u2019ll be able to point to the building and tell them I once worked there.</p> <p>\u2022 Are you a train driver, a prosecutor or a chief executive?

In contrast, Clinton did what most officials do after an uncertain and dangerous incident: urge caution and patience for conclusions from police.</p> <p>\u201cI think it\u2019s important to know the facts about any incident like this,\u201d she told reporters on her campaign plane. \u201cThat\u2019s why it\u2019s critical to support the first responders, the investigators who are looking into it trying to determine what did happen. </p> <p>\u201cI think it\u2019s also wiser to wait until you have information before making conclusions because we are just in the beginning stages of trying to determine what happened.\u201d</p> <p>Two hours after Trump\u2019s remarks, New York mayor Bill de Blasio described the bombing, which injured 29 people, as \u201can intentional act\u201d. But De Blasio, NYPD commissioner James O\u2019Neill and Governor Andrew Cuomo all stressed on Sunday that they have not found evidence so far of any link to international terrorism and are considering any suspect and motive.</p> <p>On Sunday afternoon, Clinton called the bombing one of three \u201capparent terrorist attacks\u201d alongside pending investigations into pipe bombs in New Jersey and a mass stabbing in Minnesota. The FBI is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/18/minnesota-mass-stabbing-mall-fbi-terrorism-investigation\">investigating the stabbing as a \u201cpotential terrorist attack\u201d</a>; police have ascribed no motive or suspect to the pipe bombs, which officials said on Sunday had not been established to be linked to the New York explosion.</p> <p>\u201cI pray for all of those who were wounded, and for their families,\u201d Clinton said in a statement. \u201cOnce again, we saw the bravery of our first responders who run toward danger to help others. Their quick actions saved lives.\u201d</p> <p>Clinton then reiterated her outline for an anti-terror plan, including an \u201cintelligence surge to help identify and thwart attacks\u201d and \u201cwork with Silicon Valley to counter propaganda\u201d. Both Clinton and Trump\u2019s proposals largely mirror the counter-terrorism priorities of Barack Obama, who has waged a bombing campaign abroad and authorized extensive surveillance online.</p> <p>Tim Kaine, the Democratic vice-presidential candidate, argued that his running mate has hard-earned experience in such crises.<br></p> <p>\u201cHillary Clinton was New York senator on 9/11 and was there at the World Trade Centers,\u201d he told NBC\u2019s Meet the Press. \u201cThey were still looking for survivors. And she\u2019s been through this. It\u2019s been a searing experience in her life. And she was part of the national security team that worked together to revive the hunt and wipe out [Osama] bin Laden.<br></p> <p>\u201cAnd so it is an important time where you have to have experience.\u201d</p> <p>Asked if the threat of violence, whether through bombings, mass shootings or terror, was \u201ca new normal\u201d, Kaine said: \u201cI don\u2019t accept that. We don\u2019t know yet about the cause of these incidents. But we\u2019re not allowing it to be a normal.\u201d</p> <p>Kaine also spoke of the US campaign against Islamic State, although the terror group has not claimed responsibility for the explosion. \u201cThe challenge is, as Isis realizes that they\u2019re losing ground, then they see whether they can exploit weaknesses elsewhere,\u201d he said.<br></p> <p>On Sunday Trump only acknowledged the bombing only with a tweet, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/777494113834917888\">writing</a>: \u201cI would like to express my warmest regards, best wishes and condolences to all of the families and victims of the horrible bombing in NYC.\u201d</p> <p>His ally Chris Christie, the governor of New Jersey, was markedly more cautious than the Republican nominee when asked about the bombing on Sunday. A pipe bomb exploded in the New Jersey town of Seaside on Saturday, and though police say they have found no connection between that explosion and New York\u2019s, they were investigating any possible link.<br></p> <p>\u201cWe don\u2019t believe at this time that there is evidence connecting it to the attacks in New York or Minnesota,\u201d Christie told CNN, referring to a stabbing at a mall in St Cloud in which eight people were wounded and the suspect, who reportedly made reference to Allah, was shot dead. \u201cWe have some promising leads, but no suspects at this time.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou don\u2019t want to jump to conclusions,\u201d he added. \u201cAnd you don\u2019t want to put information out there that you don\u2019t know is absolutely true.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--supporting\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2016/09/manhattan_explosion-zip/giv-22601KtRnW5sKJ5ka/\" data-alt=\"The site of the explosion in Manhattan.\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2016/09/manhattan_explosion-zip/giv-22601KtRnW5sKJ5ka/\">The site of the explosion in Manhattan.</a> </figure>  <p>But despite this admonition Christie defended Trump\u2019s decision to describe the explosion as a bombing long before there was any evidence to do so. </p> <p>\u201cI think that what Donald did was perfectly appropriate to tell that group in Colorado Springs that a bomb had exploded,\u201d Christie said. </p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t think you have to defer when saying that there was an explosion and a bomb in New York. I mean, everybody knew that. It was being reported on television.\u201d</p> <p>Most news networks were careful to say that police did not know the cause of the explosion at the time.</p> <p>Throughout his campaign, Trump has spoken of America in almost dystopian terms, describing it \u2013 often with false or misleading statements \u2013 as a \u201c<a href=\"http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/presidential-races/288099-trump-country-is-divided-crime-scene\">divided crime scene</a>\u201d where refugees are a \u201c<a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/video/us/100000004648650/trump-likens-refugees-to-trojan-horse.html\">Trojan horse</a>\u201d for terrorism, police are endangered and murder and unemployment on the rise. </p> <p>He has also reacted in unpredictable ways in the aftermath of horrific events, for instance after the mass shooting in Orlando in June, when he thanked people <a href=\"http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/presidential-races/288099-trump-country-is-divided-crime-scene\"> for \u201cthe congrat</a><a href=\"https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/742034549232766976\">s for being right on radical Islamic terrorism\u201d</a>.</p> <p>Christie echoed Trump\u2019s dark vision of the US on Sunday, and blamed Clinton and Barack Obama for it. </p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s because of her type of leadership over the last eight years,\u201d he said, \u201calong with the president, that the world is a much more dangerous place.\u201d</p> <p>Clinton contrasted that message in her own statement, saying: \u201cAmericans have faced threats before, and our resilience in the face of them only makes us stronger. I am confident we will once again choose resolve over fear.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>The social housing sector is a bit like the Labour party \u2013 deeply divided, although not quite so nasty. </p> <p>On the one side are the pragmatists, those prepared to go with the flow and do the government\u2019s bidding, with its trajectory towards home ownership. Some in this group see a bright future in a more commercial environment, where they build homes for sale and private rent. A tiny few look forward to a future where they can break free from the shackles of state control and become fully private companies.</p> <p>On the other side are the traditionalists, those who see social rented housing as worth fighting for and who argue the case for public investment to provide low-cost homes for rent, to boost the economy and to cut the <a href=\"https://www.ifs.org.uk/publications/7762\">\u00a326bn</a> a year spent on housing benefits.</p> <p>The pragmatists have accused the traditionalists of being dinosaurs, harking back to a golden age of social housing that never was. The traditionalists accuse the pragmatists of selling out the sector for the sake of their own careers. And so it goes on. In truth, as it celebrates <a href=\"http://www.housingday.co.uk/\">National Housing Day</a> on 19 September, the social housing sector is in a dangerous place.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/housing-network/2015/oct/07/david-cameron-kill-off-social-housing-affordable-homes\">David Cameron is on track to kill off social housing</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The exact legal status of housing associations has been unclear for decades. The National Housing Federation has long argued that they are private, independent, charitable organisations, but last October the Office for National Statistics, swayed by the ability of ministers to appoint board members and managers to associations and by the fact that consent is required before they can dispose of properties, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/housing-network/2015/oct/30/end-housing-associations-ons-public-sector\">reclassified housing association as public bodies</a>. </p> <p>That decision means there is an ever-present danger that their assets could be sold off to the private sector. The pragmatists are therefore right to point out that it would be foolish to challenge or annoy the government in any way, and defend last year\u2019s decision to agree with the government a voluntary deal to extend right-to-buy to social housing tenants. For traditionalists, though, that deal is simply an example of a supine approach.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>It doesn\u2019t help that the latest analysis of chief executive salaries shows inflation-busting pay increases across the board \u2013 something that is bound to annoy the Tory right, given that the bulk of housing association income comes from the taxpayer. An own goal, say the traditionalists.</p> <p>The only hope of reuniting the sector is if the new government ditches the Cameron/Osborne obsession with home ownership and realises the sense of investing in genuinely affordable homes. </p> <p>The housing minister, Gavin Barwell, has flagged up a possible change of approach. This week he said that we need \u201cto build more homes of every single type and not focus on one single tenure\u201d. Whether that signals a genuine change of approach remains to be seen. </p> <p><strong><a href=\"https://register.theguardian.com/housing/\">Sign up</a> for your free Guardian Housing network newsletter with news and analysis sent direct to you on the last Friday of the month.

  "<p>European embassies in Britain have logged dozens of incidents of suspected hate crime and abuse against their citizens since the vote to leave the European Union, according to figures obtained by the Guardian.<br></p> <p>The vast majority of xenophobic incidents involved citizens from eastern European countries, with more attacks against Poles than all the other nationalities put together, the survey of EU embassies in London revealed. </p> <p>The Polish consular service in London, Manchester and Edinburgh has logged 31 incidents of reported hate crime since 23 June, including eight attacks in the past three weeks. </p> <p>They include the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/aug/31/harlow-death-arkadiusz-jozwik-exposes-left-behind-town-where-residents-live-in-fear\">killing of Arkadiusz J\u00f3\u017awik in Harlow</a>, in an apparently unprovoked attack that is being treated by police as a possible hate crime. Five 15-year-old boys and one 16-year-old boy, all from Harlow, were <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/aug/30/five-teenage-boys-arrested-after-man-dies-following-attack-in-essex\">arrested on suspicion of murdering J\u00f3\u017awik</a> and bailed until 7 October pending further inquiries. A second Polish man survived the attack.</p> <p>The Guardian contacted the London embassies of all 27 EU member states. Of the 17 embassies that replied, almost half reported a rise in incidents of xenophobic abuse in the 12 weeks since the EU referendum. Between them, there were 60 incidents logged, including shots fired at a Lithuanian home in Lurgan, Northern Ireland, this month, an arson attack on a Romanian shop in Norwich in July and a break-in at a home in Nottingham in the immediate aftermath of the vote when a Latvian family were called \u201cfucking immigrants\u201d and told to leave the UK. </p> <p>The bulk of the attacks were against Poles or people mistaken for Poles. A Finnish mother was told \u201cPoles go home\u201d when she was overheard talking to her children, according to the Finnish embassy in London. The embassies of western European countries that responded to the survey, including Spain, France and Germany, reported no post-referendum abuse against their citizens. </p> <p>Arkady Rzegocki, the Polish ambassador to the UK, said he was \u201csaddened by each and every incident\u201d.</p> <p>He added: \u201cThe Polish community is the largest national minority in the UK and, due to its visibility, may be statistically an easier target of xenophobic abuse. We recognise and appreciate the show of solidarity from the British public and the decisive steps taken by the British government and local authorities to resolve the problem. We need to work together to foster dialogue and mutual understanding between communities.\u201d</p> <p>The issue of hate crime in the wake of the vote was raised by London-based diplomats at a working lunch of the Nordic group of ambassadors on Tuesday. Latvia\u2019s ambassador, Baiba Bra\u017ee, who hosted the lunch, said: \u201cIt is a trend that we discussed. Our citizens have not experienced anything like this before the referendum.<br></p> <p>\u201cNone of six incidents [involving Latvians] referred to the referendum, but there is maybe an atmosphere that is more permitting of unpleasant words and maybe actions. There shouldn\u2019t be any discrimination and the Latvian community shouldn\u2019t let it go unreported.\u201d </p> <p>Jon Burnett, a researcher at the Institute of Race Relations, said: \u201cThe upsurge in attacks against eastern Europeans should come as no surprise, given the way that they have been portrayed repeatedly as scroungers, cheats and, ultimately, threats. This depiction, which intensified in the build-up to the referendum, of course predated it. The hate crimes are a product of a politically constructed climate which has been years in the making.\u201d</p> <p>Bra\u017ee welcomed the British government\u2019s assurances that it would not tolerate such abuse. She said she had been encouraged by a fall in incidents involving Latvians since the immediate aftermath of the vote. </p> <p>But the Polish embassy is troubled by a recent uptick in violence against Poles. Many of the 31 attacks it recorded took place in the days after the vote and, by early August, the embassy had detected a lull in incidents. But there has been a new spike in attacks, with eight incidents in the past three weeks, including attacks on three other Poles in Harlow and an allegedly racist attack on a Polish man in the Armley area of Leeds last Friday. </p> <h2>\u2018We\u2019re going to put cameras up\u2019</h2> <p>In the days after the Brexit vote, one Polish family in Plymouth felt the force of what appears to be a continuing spike in hate crimes across the country. An arson attack destroyed a shed at their home in Efford. The perpetrators left a note <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-devon-36737529\">which read</a>: \u201cGo back to your country next be [sic] your family.\u201d</p> <p>Ewa Banaszek, 22, said the experience had stayed with her and her family but they were trying to get on with their lives and had received support from the local community. A crowdfunding appeal on behalf of the family raised \u00a37,000.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3f725edcec92b34038773ba0a7d45d30a49394ff\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3f725edcec92b34038773ba0a7d45d30a49394ff/0_66_2080_1248/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Adam Ablamowicz with daughter Ewa Banaszak,\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Adam Ablamowicz with daughter Ewa Banaszak,</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Plymouth Herald/SWNS.com</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cIt has been overwhelming really,\u201d said Banaszek, who works at a leisure centre in Plymouth. \u201cWhen it happened, lots of local people left flowers outside the house and even now people are always checking if we are OK.</p> <p>\u201cThe way the money was raised was really heartening. I told Hannah [Brotherstone], who arranged the fundraising, how overwhelmed we were. We now have the money and we are going to put cameras up around the house and this will help to pay for them.</p> <p>\u201cSince the incident we have tried to just get on with our life. The attack will always be in the back of my mind, but people have been supportive.\u201d</p> <p>Gareth Cuerden, hate crime manager for Victim Support in Wales, said a media focus on hate crime had led to a positive impact in encouraging victims to speak out. </p> <p>\u201cIt has made people feel empowered to come forward and report what has happened to them. I think because of that we are getting a truer picture of the scale of hate crime,\u201d he said. \u201cResearch shows that it is underreported \u2013 50% of people wait until it gets more serious before they consider reporting and instead they tend to normalise incidents. But this attention on hate crime has made them feel able to report, which is a positive thing.\u201d</p> <p>Iolanda Viegas, a councillor for the Portuguese community in Wrexham, north Wales, said people had been heartened by the support they were receiving from their neighbours and from the police in the aftermath of the vote.</p> <p>\u201cThe police have come along to tell us what to do if these incidents happen, they have talked to people about what a hate crime is and what they should do if they are targeted. And many people in the wider community are helping. At least we feel we are not alone and that someone will help us.\u201d</p> <h2>Embassy breakdown of reported xenophobic incidents since the referendum</h2> <p><strong>Poland </strong>31 incidents reported as hate crimes. As well as the killing of J\u00f3\u017awik they include eight assaults, including attacks on Polish men in Yeovil, St Ives and Leeds; seven attacks on Polish homes and businesses; and four cases of abusive graffiti, including messages scrawled on the front door of the Polish Cultural Association in Hammersmith, west London, and on a war memorial in Portsmouth. The 31 cases include six reports of fresh abuse in longstanding complaints about intimidation from neighbours that predate the referendum.</p> <p><strong>Lithuania </strong>10 incidents of alleged hate crimes, five of which are being investigated by the police. They include a shooting at a Lithuanian home in Lurgan, Northern Ireland, on 5 September. Other incidents of alleged abuse have been reported in Peterborough, Kings Lynn and Boston, where many Lithuanians work as agricultural labourers. A spokesman said: \u201cThe Lithuanian community is very concerned [by] the surge of hate attacks after the referendum.\u201d </p> <p>Lithuania\u2019s deputy foreign minister, Mantvydas Beke\u0161ius, has raised the issue with the Foreign Office. He said Lithuanian children in UK schools had been <a href=\"https://www.urm.lt/default/en/news/concerns-over-attacks-against-lithuanians-have-been-expressed-to-the-uk-minister-of-state-for-immigration-who-visited-lithuanian-embassy-in-london\">verbally abused</a> not just by other pupils but by parents and even teachers since the referendum.</p> <p><strong>Latvia </strong>Six incidents of alleged xenophobic abuse and harassment, in Nottingham, London, Bristol, Wellingborough, Yorkshire and South Shields. The worst incident involved a break-in at a home in Nottingham where a Latvian family were branded \u201cfucking immigrants\u201d and told to leave the UK. The embassy also reported that Latvians had been refused service at a post office in London and at a mobile phone shop in Bristol in the days after the vote.</p> <p><strong>Sweden </strong>\u201cAround five\u201d incidents of verbal abuse. A spokesman said: \u201cThat\u2019s a big increase, because we haven\u2019t really seen abuse against Swedish citizens in recent memory. It is obviously linked to the referendum, because phrases like \u2018go home\u2019 were used.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Finland </strong>Until the referendum, no Finns had been involved in xenophobic incidents. Since the vote, there have been four incidents, including a mother being told \u201cPoles go home\u201d when she was overheard speaking to her children.</p> <p><strong>Romania </strong>On 8 July, a Romanian shop in Norwich was torched in what Norfolk police are treating as a hate crime. The embassy also reported \u201ca few\u201d other xenophobic incidents, but declined to give details.</p> <p><strong>Bulgaria </strong>One \u201cxenophobia-motivated\u201d attack against a Bulgarian national in the UK. The embassy refused to provide details.</p> <p><strong>Hungary </strong>A \u201cmarginal number\u201d of inquiries expressing fear after the referendum.</p> <p>The embassies of <strong>Belgium, Greece, Germany, France, Denmark, Cyprus, Austria, Spain and Estonia</strong> reported no abuse of their citizens in the UK.</p> <p><em>Additional reporting by Chris Owen</em></p>",

Welcome to the Global Development podcast. This episode looks at the challenge of getting more girls into education.<br></p> <p><strong> JGR</strong> I think education is vital for any country if it\u2019s going to be successful; and there are millions and millions of children out of school, as we speak, who don\u2019t have the chance to learn. But within that we know that of those children it\u2019s most likely to be girls who are missing out.</p> <p><strong> JG</strong> At the current rate of change for girls in sub-Saharan Africa we won\u2019t see the first generation of girls who universally go to primary and lower secondary school until into the next century, 2111.</p> <p><strong> PR</strong> So girls are by far the worst affected in conflict situations. Only around 4% of adolescent girls complete lower secondary school. </p> <p><strong> LL </strong>In this podcast I visit rural communities in southern Zimbabwe to investigate some of the obstacles that are keeping girls out of education. And I speak to those leading programmes that are aiming to make a difference. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2016/sep/06/poorest-countries-hit-hardest-world-lags-behind-global-education-goals-unesco-report\">Poorest countries hit hardest as world lags behind on global education goals</a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong> ND</strong> I\u2019ll give you one example of a girl that actually kind of like sits out, showcases exactly how we do. She\u2019s called Rehema. </p> <p><strong> LL</strong> Nasikiwa Duke is the programme manager at the NGO Camfed in Tanzania. She supports young women through Camfed\u2019s alumnae network, known as Cama, and is recalling the experience of Rehema, one of the girls who came through the scheme. </p> <p><strong> ND</strong> She realised that one of the girls was not attending school for about two or three weeks so she reported to the teacher mentor to see if she\u2019s also aware of this situation. She realised that the girl is not going to school but it\u2019s not because she\u2019s sick or anything. The girl told her, \u201cMy mother wants to marry me off.\u201d \u201cWhy?\u201d \u201cBecause she said she cannot take care of me any more.\u201d So the teacher said, \u201cWhat actually is the reason?\u201d \u201cHer mother is saying they are living in poverty, the school fees and other costs are too much for her to bear.\u201d So the teacher said, \u201cOK, actually tell the girl to come back to school and we will see how we\u2019ll support her.\u201d </p> <p> A week later the girl came back to school. The girl continued at least for a term, and then later she dropped out again. Rehema made the follow up. And the mother said, \u201cWell you supported me then, you don\u2019t support me now, and you know the only thing I can do is for her to get a husband so you know she has someone to take care of her.\u201d </p> <p><strong> LL</strong> According to the Global Partnership for Education, 63 million girls around the world are out of school. The reasons for this are complex and often country specific. Professor Pauline Rose is director of the Research for Equitable Access and Learning Centre in the faculty of education at Cambridge University. </p> <p><strong> PR</strong> There might not be any schools for them. Their schools are more likely to be destroyed. So where there are only all girls\u2019 schools in Pakistan and Afghanistan, for example, they can be the direct target of conflict. Girls can also face physical violence on the way to school. In the Democratic Republic of Congo over half of girls report that they\u2019ve been physically assaulted on the way to school or in other situations, which means that it\u2019s unsafe for them to go to school. Girls themselves can be part of the conflict. In some west African countries, around three-quarters of child suicide bombers are actually female. And we forget that they are actually also caught up in the conflict themselves. </p> <p> Syrian refugees living in Jordan are more likely \u2013 far more likely \u2013 now to be getting married earlier. They\u2019re 18 times more likely to get married early partly because of the consequence of the security issues. </p> <p><strong> LL</strong> This was also the case for the girl supported by Rehema, the young woman in Camfed\u2019s Tanzanian alumnae network. Nasikiwa.</p> <p><strong> ND</strong> When they realised that she was already processed into that initiation ceremony to get her to be married off, now they had to step up and call even more government leaders and local authorities, the executive officers, the wide councillors in the village to actually sit down and see how we can make sure this girl does not drop out again. And right now that girl is back in school.</p> <p> And the mother has joined the parents support group; she\u2019s now advocating for more parents to change and not see poverty, yes it is a barrier, but if we pull up the efforts together we can actually fight it. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2016/sep/14/africa-shortage-of-engineering-skills-and-female-students-will-stunt-its-growth\">Africa's shortage of engineering skills \u2018will stunt its growth\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong> LL</strong> At Gomututu primary school near Zvishavane I meet Ethel Kufa. Ethel works as an education programme facilitator for the Improving Girls\u2019 Access through Transforming Education programme, known as Igate. Supported by DfID\u2019s Girls Education Challenge Fund the programme aims to reach 100,000 marginalised girls from 467 schools located in four provinces in Zimbabwe. Ethel explains that some schools don\u2019t yet provide the most fundamental facilities for girls. </p> <p><strong> EK</strong> When you look at this school environment, is it friendly to the pupils? Is it friendly to the girl child? Is it friendly to the boy child? Because when you look at the girl friendly toilets and the issue of menstrual hygiene, that means this needs to be supported by the school development committees and the school head. </p> <p><strong> LL</strong> And when girls don\u2019t have the resources for sanitary products they simply don\u2019t go to school.</p> <p><strong> BG</strong> My name is Beauty Ganyannee. I work for Zimbabwe National Family Planning Council as community distributor. The major challenge that we are facing is mothers group in the ramp making, is that we don\u2019t have enough money to purchase the material for ramp making. Ramps basically these are reusable menstrual pads. So these many made pads, they\u2019re handmade pads, they\u2019re made by hands using those threads and needles. These ramps, we need material to make these ramps, such as fleece material and the water-proof material to make these ramps. At the moment, due to drought, we can\u2019t afford to purchase these materials because many families they are focusing on buying food, mealie meal and cereal for their family members. </p> <p><strong> LL</strong> Another very practical barrier to girls attending school is the distance a girl may have to travel. One very popular solution I witnessed in Zimbabwe has been providing bikes for girls to get to school. Fiona Mavhinga leads the Zimbabwean branch of Cama.</p> <p><strong> FM</strong> Indeed, distance to school is a challenge. I remember at my former school that I went to in rural Wedza in Zimbabwe, the parents\u2019 support groups that Nasikiwa referred to came together and built a house to make sure that girls have safe accommodation, the girls that were coming from long distances. </p> <p> And one of the mothers, the leader of mothers of the parents\u2019 support groups, volunteered to become a hostel matron for that group, volunteering her time and making sure that the girls, while they are there, they are safe. I think this has been the response mechanism to address that across Zambia and Tanzania as well where we have a lot of community hostels that are being supported by parents working together with Camfed. </p> <p><strong> LL</strong> Now a lawyer, Fiona was herself one of the girls supported by Camfed when it was set up in 1993; a network which started with just 32 and which has now grown to more than 55,000.</p> <p><strong> FM</strong> Picture me 12 years ago when I started working as a lawyer in a law firm with 13 lawyers, 12 who were males and only one female. And picture me 12 years before that, I was this girl growing up in rural Zimbabwe, waking up at 4am every morning with my grandmother to go and sell vegetables so that we can raise money for food, we can raise money for school stationery; and my mother in turn trading dried fish for maize, which she also later on sold to raise fees for myself. Many times we went without food, so many times I was at risk of dropping out of school.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2016/aug/30/girls-india-learn-app-coding-navigate-way-out-mumbai-slum\">Girls learn app coding to navigate a way out of their Mumbai slum</a> </p> </aside>  <p> My life really of a girl struggling to maintain her grip on an education is, as you know, not so different from millions of girls with a background of poverty. And when I think of myself now and the life of my friends that I grew up with in the same village as me, our lives are totally different just because of one thing: an education.</p> <p><strong> LL</strong> Julia Gillard, the former prime minister of Australia, is the board chair for the Global Partnership for Education. </p> <p><strong> JG</strong> Well, it\u2019s partly about conflict and fragility and the capacity of their nations to offer education; it\u2019s partly about poverty. It\u2019s about cultural attitudes that if you\u2019re a very poor family and can only afford to send one child to school then it is the boy who goes. It\u2019s about early marriage and the perceptions of what girls life roles are going to be; and consequently how much education they need.</p> <p><strong> LL</strong> As Nasikiwa explains, poverty creates a ripple effect that can lead to psychological challenges. </p> <p><strong> ND</strong> The psychosocial challenges are many and one of them is self-esteem, which is most of the cases being affiliated to issues around poverty, to issues around the community acknowledging your value, community accepting you, being listened to, having people actually seeing you as a person of potential. You might have parents, but not understanding the worth of a child having education. So we have to make sure that we have that understanding in the community that you work with, but also the children to see the value in themselves, because that will give them a push to excel.</p> <p><strong> PZ</strong> My name is Prudence Zurumba and I am turning 19 in May. I am part of the team the defending champion of the Coca Cola tournament. I play centre-back. I think it\u2019s because I\u2019m intelligent, I think fast. You have to be someone who thinks fast to clear the ball because you\u2019ll be the only person the whole team would be depending on. </p> <p><strong> LL</strong> Prudence is from Chidyamakondo high school near Masvingo in southern Zimbabwe. As well as being a star footballer, she is bright and confident and hopes to continue her education but, as ever, money is an issue. </p> <p><strong> PZ</strong> If I pass I would like to go to the university and study law \u2026 My older sister wants to go to university and my older brother is just staying at home. If things go well with my father, maybe she will go. The issue is the money. </p> <p><strong> LL</strong> So what are the routes available to get more girls into education? Ethel has been working with the community in Gomututu, helping them to set up their own support groups. </p> <p><strong> EK</strong> So you have seen that we have capacitated these community members. They can do some of these fundraising issues on their own without the support of external donors. The impact of Igate we have seen that girl child they are being re-enrolled in school. Parents they now afford to pay some parents who are in the village settings and then in groups they now afford to pay school fees for their pupils. The girls they are saying they now have confidence. They can do activities likes poems, dramas. Some of them they are performing very well in class and the parents they are saying they have enlightened us. We can now afford to send our children to school. We now afford to buy school uniforms for our kids. So I think we are making some impact. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2016/jul/05/new-financial-bond-helping-us-get-more-girls-into-schools-india-education\">A new financial bond is helping us get more girls into schools in India</a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong> LL</strong> Beauty Ganyannee helps run one of the mothers\u2019 group initiatives. </p> <p><strong> BG</strong> As a mothers\u2019 group we conducted door-to-door campaigns on the importance of education. Since the inception of Igate in 2013 we have managed to re-enrol seven students from secondary school and three from primary. Of the four pupils that re-enrolled at secondary level, they were having problems of menstrual hygiene so when they re-enrolled to school they were supplied with menstrual pads, these reusable menstrual pads. </p> <p><strong> LL</strong> Like Igate, Camfed works closely with the community. </p> <p><strong> ND</strong> One of the things that we do is making sure the community sees the value of a girl going to school, because then they will take the responsibility to make sure that she goes and stays there. So we have in collaborations with parents, with local leaders, government leaders, chiefs, especially in Zimbabwe, we get them engaged. But also getting engaged in partnerships with government at the highest level of policy making and influence, to make sure that there is a support from the ground up to the national level.</p> <p> We make sure that there is peer support, especially to the young girls who are going to school, to make sure they have someone to confide in, someone whom they can rely on for advice, for support, because sometimes there is not that direct support, especially psychosocial issues when it comes to the family level.</p> <p><strong> LL</strong> As well as chairing the board of Global Partnership for Education, Julia Gillard is also patron of Camfed. She values their grassroot networks approach but is also working on the bigger picture, fostering support at national and international level.</p> <p><strong> JG</strong> It\u2019s a very individual model of change where girls themselves are in the lead but a growing and sustainable model of change; because the evidence is each girl who\u2019s been supported tends to support at least two or three more girls, so it\u2019s got great growth.</p> <p> GPE, the Global Partnership for Education, works on a whole-systems basis. We fundamentally believe that if you are going to give children a chance, then you have to have a high quality education system that offers equity and learning. So every child gets to go to school, the schools are of high quality, the system functions well and children learn. And so we work with developing country governments, we work with stakeholders within country. So it\u2019s moving the big levers of change.</p> <p><strong> LL</strong> At the Girls Education Forum held in London in July this year, the focus was on working collectively to get girls in school.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2016/jul/07/uk-government-pledges-100m-poorest-girls-universal-primary-secondary-education-2030\">UK government pledges \u00a3100m to help world's poorest girls make the grade</a> </p> </aside>  <p> Justine Greening, then the UK\u2019s secretary of state for international development, is now education minister. </p> <p><strong> JGR</strong> We particularly want to focus on those girls who may have already missed out but we don\u2019t think it\u2019s too late for them to learn. And we want to put some investment into those girls who are most likely to be out of school to help them still get an education. </p> <p><strong> LL</strong> So today you committed \u00a3100m, over what period? </p> <p><strong> JGR</strong> This will be over the next eight years, up to essentially just beyond 2020. And what we\u2019ll be doing is focusing on girls who may have never been in school in the first place and have missed out, say, in primary school.</p> <p><strong> LL</strong> While the millennium development goals got more children into primary schools, the new sustainable development goals will try to tackle both quality and access for those that are still left behind.</p> <p><strong> JG</strong> The purpose of sitting in school isn\u2019t to simply sit in something called a schoolhouse, it\u2019s actually to learn. I think from that MDG approach we now know as a global community that we\u2019ve got to focus on access and learning at the same time. We know more about who is most at risk of getting left behind, and obviously it is the girls \u2013 particularly the most impoverished girls \u2013 who are at most risk of getting left behind. We\u2019re clearer than we used to be about the impact of conflict and crisis and some of the ways we can support children and their families in humanitarian crisis so they still get education. I think it\u2019s about getting all that we\u2019ve learned and now better resourcing what works so that we are making more and more change.</p> <p><strong> LL</strong> That\u2019s all for this edition of the Global Development podcast.

There are no standard walkways to be found: instead, the tangled, twisting aerial roots of the rubber trees on the banks stretch across the water, forming a living, ever-growing bridge to the other side. These organic bridges are the result of a little human guidance and a lot of patience. Members of the local Khasi tribe control their growth by laying lengths of bamboo or betel nut tree across the water as a guide, then waiting for the roots of the rubber trees to follow along. As the roots grow, the Khasi add handrails made of vines and fill in gaps with mud and stones, creating a solid pathway. It takes up to 20 years for a bridge to become sturdy enough to cross.</p> <h2>Merry Cemetery, S\u0103p\u00e2n\u021ba, Romania</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9d20b84d286904bff00336c1331ce005e15bd5b8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9d20b84d286904bff00336c1331ce005e15bd5b8/0_0_2200_1650/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Merry Cemetery, Sapanta, Romania\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>At the Cimitirul Vesel (Merry cemetery) over 600 colourful wooden crosses bear the life stories, dirty details and final moments of the bodies that lie below. Illustrated crosses depict S\u0103p\u00e2n\u021ba\u2019s soldiers being beheaded and a townsperson being hit by a truck. The epigraphs are frank and often funny: \u201cUnderneath this heavy cross lies my mother-in-law \u2026 Try not to wake her up. For if she comes back home, she\u2019ll bite my head off.\u201d The cemetery\u2019s style was created during the 1930s by Stan Ioan P\u0103tra\u015f, who began carving clever and ironic poems about the deceased and painting their portraits on the crosses. P\u0103tra\u015f died in 1977, having carved his own cross and left his house and business to his most talented apprentice, Dumitru Pop. Despite the darkly comic \u2013 or merely dark \u2013 tones of the crosses, Pop says no one has ever complained about the work.</p> <h2>Star City, Moscow Oblast, Russia</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"373677afbf5fd26ad122bb7c7c082033df17557c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/373677afbf5fd26ad122bb7c7c082033df17557c/0_0_4000_2666/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Part of a space ship in a pool of water at the Yuri Gagarin Cosmonaut Training Center, Star City, Moscow Oblast, Russia.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>During the development of the Soviet space programme, a secret air force facility in the woods north-east of Moscow transformed into a settlement called Star City. The area centred on the Yuri Gagarin Cosmonaut Training Center, where prospective cosmonauts would undergo physical, technical, and psychological preparation for space flight. Following the dissolution of the USSR in 1991, the curtain of secrecy was lifted, and the centre opened its doors to the public. Today, a handful of companies offer tours of the facility, during which visitors can wear a mock spacesuit, take a ride in the centrifuge, or board a zero-gravity flight that simulates weightlessness through a parabolic trajectory. A museum of space travel and exploration contains an impressive collection of vintage spacesuits and capsules charred from re-entering the atmosphere.<br>\u2022<em> </em><a href=\"http://www.gctc.su/\"><em>gctc.su</em></a><em>, </em><em><a href=\"http://starcity-tours.com/\">starcity-tours.com</a></em></p> <h2>Fingal\u2019s Cave, Scotland</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2b823c54617e12b2f08c8b5ea29ae2dc24233aa9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2b823c54617e12b2f08c8b5ea29ae2dc24233aa9/0_8_1044_626/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Exterior of Fingal\u2019s Cave, Scotland, as seen from a boat looking towards shore.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Like something out of a fantasy novel, Fingal\u2019s Cave in Scotland\u2019s Inner Hebrides is a huge (82 x 22 metre) sea cavern with walls of hexagonal basalt columns. Celtic legend holds that the cave was once part of a bridge across the sea, built by giants to fight one another. Science says it was formed by masses of lava that cooled so slowly it broke into long hexagonal pillars, like mud cracking under the hot sun. When naturalist Sir Joseph Banks rediscovered the cave in 1772, it captured people\u2019s imagination and inspired the work of artists, writers, and musicians. Composer Felix Mendelssohn wrote an overture about the cave in 1830, the same year painter JMW Turner depicted it on canvas. Thus was born a Romantic-era tourist site that is just as entrancing today.</p> <h2>Underground Temples of Damanhur, Italy</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7f9d431ee9a1229ae6114f176558b9843359e9be\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7f9d431ee9a1229ae6114f176558b9843359e9be/0_267_1093_1093/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A large reception space at the underground temples of Damanhur in Italy.

Damanhur, 30 miles north of Turin, is based on neo-pagan and new-age beliefs with emphasis on creative expression, meditation, and spiritual healing. From 1978 to 1992, its citizens worked around the clock in shifts to excavate 8,500 cubic metres of earth. Each hall, and hallway, was decorated in a different theme, with murals, stained glass windows, mirrors, and mosaics. The 70s-style artwork depicts many things, from the history of the universe to a forest of endangered animals to the International Space Station. The perimeter of one of the circular rooms is cluttered with sculptures, due to the directive that each member of the community must carve a statue in their own likeness.</p> <h2>Firefly squids in Toyama Bay, Japan </h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fafc398cf42a2eac1ab5ac83b9c42f733f48387b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fafc398cf42a2eac1ab5ac83b9c42f733f48387b/0_1475_3393_3393/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A volcanic beach off Toyama Bay glows blue with firefly squid.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>The firefly squid is a cephalopod that glows brilliant blue and usually lives in the deep, dark waters surrounding Japan. But every year, from March to May, millions surface in Toyama Bay to spawn. This time of year is also prime fishing season. Nets trawl the pre-dawn waters, hauling up piles of squirming, glowing creatures and turning boats into beacons. The beaches are bathed in a blue glow as the adult squid \u2013 who have a one-year lifespan \u2013 lay their eggs and prepare to die. The Japanese government regards the annual show as a \u201cspecial natural monument\u201d. While the firefly squid are highly regarded for their magical visual effects, they are also prized for their tasty innards. After basking in the glow of the bioluminescent bay, go to a sushi joint and feast on squid served raw, boiled, or turned into tempura.</p> <h2>Kane Kwei carpentry workshop, Accra, Ghana</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7b9eb9d77df0c834fc052900a822decca900a06e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7b9eb9d77df0c834fc052900a822decca900a06e/326_0_1155_693/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Carved coffins made by Kane Kwei Carpentry Workshop, Accra, Ghana\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>A Ghanaian teacher was once buried in a ballpoint pen, a singer was laid to rest inside a microphone, and a labourer was interred in a hammer.

In 1913, the adventurous then 26-year-old left his village in Catalonia and moved to tropical northern Australia. There, he eventually found wealth as a sugar cane farmer, and was able to pursue his dream. In 1929, Paronella purchased a plot of rainforest in Queensland and began building his castle by hand, using sand, clay, old train tracks, gravel from the nearby creek, and wood taken from abandoned houses. By 1935, the structure had expanded to include a pool, cafe, cinema and ballroom, as well as tennis courts and villa gardens with a grand staircase \u2013 all open to the public. After Paronella\u2019s death in 1948, the building suffered decades of neglect, but conservation efforts mean the castle is alive again. Lush tropical plants have encroached upon and mingled with Paronella\u2019s hand-built stairs and fountains, making them look like they sprouted from their natural surroundings.<br>\u2022<em> </em><a href=\"http://www.paronellapark.com.au/\"><em>paronellapark.com.au</em></a></p> <h2>Great Stalacpipe Organ, Luray, Virginia, US</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"8b29a79f4e2b5289c47a4d2b14e2d522a6b901fb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8b29a79f4e2b5289c47a4d2b14e2d522a6b901fb/0_70_1475_885/1000.jpg\" alt=\"An organ in the Luray Caverns, Luray, Virginia.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Deep in the limestone Luray caverns is an unusual musical instrument designed by a tinkerer named Leland W Sprinkle. With its four-keyboard console, it looks like a standard variety church organ, but there\u2019s a crucial difference: there are no pipes. Instead, the \u201cpipes\u201d are stalactites and the instrument is a lithophone \u2013 a device that produces music by striking rocks of differing tones. Sprinkle, a mathematician and electronics scientist at the Pentagon, came up with the idea for the \u201cStalacpipe Organ\u201d after touring the caverns in 1954. He spent three years searching for stalactites that corresponded to the required musical notes, sanding them down to be pitch-perfect, and running five miles of wires between the console and the rubber mallets that would strike each stalactite. When the organ was first installed, Sprinkle himself took to the keys to entertain visitors. These days the organ entertains cave visitors with automated renditions of such classics as Moonlight Sonata.<br>\u2022 <a href=\"http://luraycaverns.com/\"><em>luraycaverns.com</em></a></p> <h2>Everlasting lightning storm, Catatumbo, Venezuela</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"152944c454c91b0ca75742c1a092271e23fb223f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/152944c454c91b0ca75742c1a092271e23fb223f/0_0_2713_2170/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A flash of \u201cCatatumbo Lightning\u201d in Zulia, Venezuela.

For 260 nights of the year, often for up to 10 hours at a time, the sky above the river is pierced by lightning, producing as many as 280 strikes per hour. Known as the relampago del Catatumbo (the Catatumbo lightning), this everlasting lightning storm has been raging for as long as people can remember. The lightning, visible from 25 miles away, is so regular that it\u2019s been used as a navigation aid by ships and is known among sailors as the Maracaibo Beacon. Recent scientific studies have determined that the concentrated lightning is likely caused by an air current that sweeps moisture from the Caribbean Sea and drives it up above the lake.

Its importance appeared to be emphasised by data published on Sunday showing that <a href=\"http://www.bis.org/publ/qtrpdf/r_qt1609w.htm\">foreign banks with affiliates in the UK account for a large share of international banking activity in London</a>. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/sep/18/central-bankers-group-bis-stark-warning-world-economy\">Central bankers group issues stark warning on world economy</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In the wake of Britain\u2019s vote to leave the EU, the foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, had tried to assure US banks that the UK would retain its passporting rights even if it left the EEA,<a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/18/tory-eurosceptics-push-for-hard-brexit-eu-single-market\"> as many of Johnson\u2019s allies are pushing for</a>.</p> <p>But Weidmann appeared to quash such a compromise, describing passporting rights as \u201ccrucial\u201d for the City of London because a lack of them could force companies to relocate to financial centres on the continent such as Frankfurt.</p> <p>\u201cOf course several businesses will reconsider the location of their headquarters. As a significant financial centre and the seat of important regulatory and supervisory bodies, Frankfurt is attractive and will welcome newcomers. But I don\u2019t expect a mass exodus from London to Frankfurt.\u201d</p> <p>In a wide-ranging interview, the Bundesbank president warned of reading too much into signs that the British economy had already weathered the turbulence of the Brexit vote. \u201cBritain hasn\u2019t even applied to leave yet,\u201d Weidmann said when asked whether the remain camp\u2019s \u201cProject Fear\u201d had been exposed as scaremongering.</p> <p>\u201cTo assume on the basis of the developments so far that there won\u2019t be any negative consequences would be to draw false conclusions. Great Britain is very closely tied to the EU and Germany. If you reduce these relations to that of a third country, it will suppress economic growth in Britain.\u201d</p> <p>Speaking to a group of European newspapers including the Guardian, Germany\u2019s S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung, France\u2019s Le Monde and Italy\u2019s La Stampa at the Bundesbank headquarters in Frankfurt, Weidmann also warned the remaining EU members against trying to compensate for Britain\u2019s breakaway decision with steps towards further integration. </p> <p>\u201cFor many of its citizens, Europe has indeed lost its shine and become a projection screen for the downsides of globalisation and migration.

Integration cannot be an end in itself, it has to make sense.\u201d</p> <p>Mario Draghi, president of the European Central Bank, has argued that monetary union required a political union in order to flourish, but Weidmann said he saw no willingness among governments in Germany, France or Italy to cede control over their <span tabindex=\"-1\">budgets. \u201cOn the contrary</span><span tabindex=\"-1\">, </span><span tabindex=\"-1\">national governments and parliaments don\u2019t want Brussels to interfere.

After Brexit, everyone turned immediately to the central banks and relied on us to calm the waves and give politics the time to sort itself out.</p> <p>\u201cThe financial crisis and politicians\u2019 indecisiveness have pushed us into a new role, and we allowed it to happen.

But while Star Trek-style replicators and robot nannies remain generations away, the digital revolution is nonetheless beginning to wreak havoc. Economists and politicians have puzzled over the struggles workers have experienced in recent decades: the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2016/jul/27/uk-joins-greece-at-bottom-of-wage-growth-league-tuc-oecd\" title=\"\">pitiful rate of growth in wages</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/sep/13/oxfam-calls-on-theresa-may-to-tackle-rising-uk-inequality\" title=\"\">rising inequality</a>, and the growing flow of national income to profits and rents rather than pay cheques. The primary culprit is technology. The digital revolution has helped supercharge globalisation, automated routine jobs, and allowed small teams of highly skilled workers to manage tasks that once required scores of people. The result has been a glut of labour that economies have struggled to digest.</p> <p>Labour markets have coped the only way they are able: workers needing jobs have little option but to accept dismally low wages. Bosses shrug and use people to do jobs that could, if necessary, be done by machines. Big retailers and delivery firms feel less pressure to turn their warehouses over to robots when there are long queues of people willing to move boxes around for low pay. Law offices put off plans to invest in sophisticated document scanning and analysis technology because legal assistants are a dime a dozen. People continue to staff checkout counters when machines would often, if not always, be just as good. Ironically, the first symptoms of a dawning era of technological abundance are to be found in the growth of low-wage, low-productivity employment. And this mess starts to reveal just how tricky the construction of a workless world will be. The most difficult challenge posed by an economic revolution is not how to come up with the magical new technologies in the first place; it is how to reshape society so that the technologies can be put to good use while also keeping the great mass of workers satisfied with their lot in life. So far, we are failing.</p> <p>Preparing for a world without work means grappling with the roles work plays in society, and finding potential substitutes. First and foremost, we rely on work to distribute purchasing power: to give us the dough to buy our bread. Eventually, in our distant Star Trek future, we might get rid of money and prices altogether, as soaring productivity allows society to provide people with all they need at near-zero cost.</p> <p>For a good while longer, wages will continue to be the main way people come by money, and prices will be needed to ration access to scarce goods and services. But in the absence of any broader social change, pushing people out of work will simply redirect the flow of income from workers to firm-owners: the rich will get richer. Freeing people from work without social collapse will therefore require society to find ways other than pay for labour to channel money to those not on the job. People might come to receive more of their income in the form of state-led redistribution: through the payment of a basic income, for instance, or direct public provision of services such as education, healthcare and housing. Or, perhaps, everyone could be given a capital allotment at birth.</p> <p>These sorts of arrangements don\u2019t magically materialise as machines become more powerful. They must be brought into existence through political action. And that\u2019s where things start to get complicated. One problem is that large-scale social overhaul takes a long time to emerge and have an effect. Another is that money for nothing is not necessarily what the displaced masses are interested in.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/apr/07/robots-replacing-jobs-luddites-economics-labor\">Are robots going to steal your job? Probably | Moshe Y Vardi</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Ongoing political debates illustrate the problem. There are lots of ways a government could boost workers\u2019 pay. It could raise the minimum wage, increase wage subsidies, enact a basic income, or use more heavy-handed regulation to protect industries and force firms to share more of their profits with labourers. Tellingly, workers and trade unions seem least interested in the policies, such as a basic income, that break the link between compensation and work. This makes the building of our eventual utopia tricky; a hefty rise in the minimum wage would benefit lots of workers, but it would also discourage some firms from using the cheap labour they have been soaking up, forcing the jobless to get along in a world in which they cannot find work yet also lack the monetary means to stay out of poverty.</p> <p>Workers\u2019 preferences are easy to understand. Work is not just a means for distributing purchasing power. It is also among the most important sources of identity and purpose in individuals\u2019 lives. If the role of work in society is to shrink, other sources of purpose and identity will need to grow. Some people will manage to find these things for themselves: pursuing passions too uneconomic to live on or engaging in voluntarism, just as many retirees find satisfying ways to fill their days. But others will find themselves at a loss.</p> <p>Workers are sure to feel uncomfortable with reforms designed to clear a path to their own economic irrelevance. They are not the only ones likely to object. Redistribution implies taking as well as giving. And while some tech entrepreneurs seem to be warming to the idea of something like a universal basic income, perhaps seeing it as a moral licence to disrupt, the reservoir of resentment at those perceived to be getting too good a deal from the government never runs dry. Rich Americans are already annoyed enough at the \u201ctakers\u201d among their countrymen, those Mitt Romney labelled an incorrigible 47% in his 2012 campaign for the presidency, who pay no federal income tax \u2013 even though most work, pay other taxes, and are simply too poor to owe any income tax to the federal government. The haves who will inevitably provide a disproportionate share of the funding for future welfare states will need convincing to part with their cash.</p> <p>So societies might decide that people must be made to contribute in some way to the community to qualify for state support. Those not in work, for example, might have to participate in community service or other activity. Another approach might be more seductive. Those still in work might be less grumpy about funding a more generous welfare state if beneficiaries are deemed to be enough like them: fellow tribesmen, people of similar background and therefore felt to be deserving of charity.</p> <p>Around the rich world, it is interesting to note that it is not so much the generosity of state redistribution that is provoking societal unrest, but the fact that out groups \u2013 from Latinos to Poles to refugees \u2013are grabbing a share.</p> <p>Building a workless utopia in which wealth is broadly shared, people are mostly satisfied with their lot in life, and the peace isn\u2019t kept by excluding any inconvenient foreigners, is no easy task. The grappling has already begun, and the initial rounds of negotiation are more than a little discouraging. Two centuries from now, I am confident, we will have worked everything out splendidly. Assuming, that is, that those of us alive now can manage the first painful steps without wrecking the world in the process.</p>",

Instead, here are the three lessons Europeans should take.</p> <h2><strong>Costs too much</strong></h2> <p>The reality is that most countries won\u2019t be able to use Australia\u2019s techniques to stop people movements due to the number of arrivals and the prohibitive expense involved.</p> <p>It is true that Australia has had <a href=\"https://www.themonthly.com.au/nation-reviewed-robert-manne-comment-asylum-seekers-2706\">success in stopping the boats</a> through disrupting people smugglers\u2019 business model. This has involved turning back boats to Indonesia, offshore processing and the use of detention centres in Nauru and Papua New Guinea based on a policy that boat arrivals will never be resettled in Australia. Australia has shown that government can influence the number of arrivals through policy settings.</p> <p>However, Australia\u2019s success is not replicable in most other countries. It can only be attempted by the richest of countries which have low refugee numbers.</p> <p>Per capita, the financial cost is enormous. This week\u2019s Australian National Audit Office report details a cost of <a href=\"http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-09-13/immigration-dept-criticised-by-audit-office-offshore-centres/7839902\">$573,111 per person per year</a> for holding on Manus Island and Nauru. Australia spends more than <a href=\"http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-07-14/cost-of-offshore-processing-united-nations-fact-check/6609764\">$1bn per year on offshore processing</a> for fewer than 2,000 people. This is not a model the EU can emulate with migration flows of <a href=\"http://www.iom.int/news/mediterranean-migrant-arrivals-2016-204311-deaths-2443\">more than 200,000</a> in January to May this year alone.</p> <p>It is also worth mentioning the non-fiscal costs related to this policy. Australia\u2019s international relationships have been effected, particularly with Nauru and Papua New Guinea where Australia is accused of <a href=\"http://www.abc.net.au/news/2014-12-18/governor-slams-neo-colonialist-png-asylum-seek-deal/5977560\">neo-colonialism</a> and, crucially, with rising power Indonesia where issues around migration have <a href=\"http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-06-20/indonesia-relationship-at-low-point-labor-says/6560952\">created friction</a> in one of Australia\u2019s most important relationships.</p> <p>The detention of refugees has a demonstrably high cost for those in detention. The Australian Human Rights Commission\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.humanrights.gov.au/our-work/asylum-seekers-and-refugees/publications/forgotten-children-national-inquiry-children\">National Inquiry into Children in Immigration Detention</a> is unequivocal on the negative impact of prolonged detention on detainees\u2019 mental and physical health.</p> <p>The bottom line is that you can\u2019t stop people movements of the scale occurring in Europe by adopting Australia\u2019s border policies.</p> <h2><strong>Migration can work</strong></h2> <p>The second lesson to be taken from Australia is more positive: it is that mass migration can really work.</p> <p>The Australian experience shows the economic and cultural benefits of mass migration. From a small white settler society at the end of the second world war, Australia has been transformed to a vibrant multicultural nation. Statistics show that <a href=\"http://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/lookup/3412.0Media%20Release12014-15\">28% of the population was born overseas</a> \u2013 with at least <a href=\"http://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/lookup/2071.0main+features902012-2013\">another 20%</a> the child of an overseas-born parent.</p> <p>This is a dramatic change and results have been broadly positive. For example, Australia is one of only three countries in the world where <a href=\"http://www.theaustralian.com.au/national-affairs/education/children-of-migrants-outclassing-the-locals-at-school/story-fn59nlz9-1226136191182\">children of migrants</a> score better at school than children of non-migrants.</p> <p>Australia has reaped the economic benefits of migration. Tracing Australia\u2019s history, George Megalogenis links <a href=\"http://www.abc.net.au/radionational/programs/breakfast/george-megalogenis-on-australias-second-chance/6794052\">periods of economic growth to times when Australia was open to migration</a>. The current prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, drew this lesson: \u201copenness and multiculturalism based on mutual respect is what has defined most of the most successful societies in the world\u201d.</p> <p>When Europeans worry about the impossibility of integration of those with different cultural or religious backgrounds, Australia is a salutary case study of what is possible.</p> <h2><strong>It\u2019s under control</strong></h2> <p>The final lesson to be drawn from Australia is that the second lesson is tied to the first: to achieve societal acceptance of mass migration, the public has to be convinced that the process is under control.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/22/the-claim-that-locking-asylum-seekers-up-in-nauru-and-png-saves-lives-is-bogus\">The claim that locking asylum seekers up in Nauru and PNG saves lives is bogus | Philippe Legrain</a> </p> </aside>  <p>This is the fascinating lesson from John Howard\u2019s prime ministership. The prime minister who took such a hard line on border security was also the one who oversaw significant increases in overall migration; in 2007 the number of permanent migrants hit 191,000: <a href=\"http://www.abc.net.au/news/2012-11-27/berg---immigration/4394382\">the largest cohort since the second world war</a>.</p> <p>He understood this truth: that to build acceptance of mass migration, governments have to convince the public that the process is under control.</p> <p>The core aim of Australia\u2019s migration program is that it is orderly.

  "<p>The Australian Conservation Foundation has renewed its legal challenge to Adani\u2019s Carmichael mine, appealing against <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/sep/12/adanis-carmichael-coalmine-proves-environment-laws-too-weak-report\">a federal court ruling that endorsed its approval by the commonwealth</a>.</p> <p>The ACF on Monday lodged an appeal against <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/aug/29/greg-hunts-approval-of-adanis-queensland-mine-upheld-by-federal-court\">last month\u2019s decision</a>, which found the then federal environment minister, Greg Hunt, was entitled to find the impact on global warming and the Great Barrier Reef from the Queensland mine\u2019s 4.6bn tonnes of carbon emissions \u201cspeculative\u201d.</p> <p>The president of the ACF, Geoff Cousins, said Australia\u2019s national environment protection laws were \u201cbroken\u201d if the minister could approve \u201ca mega-polluting coalmine \u2013 the biggest in Australia\u2019s history \u2013 and claim it will have no impact on the global warming and the reef\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cIf our environment laws are too weak to actually protect Australia\u2019s unique species and places, they effectively give companies like Adani a licence to kill,\u201d Cousins said.</p> <p>\u201cBe in no doubt, Adani\u2019s Carmichael proposal is massive and will lock in decades of damaging climate pollution if it goes ahead, further wrecking the reef.</p> <p>\u201cThe science is clear that we can have coal or the reef \u2013 but we can\u2019t have both.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/aug/05/linking-adani-coal-mine-to-social-uplift-in-india-ridiculous-says-conservationist\">Linking Adani coalmine to social uplift in India ridiculous, says conservationist</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The Queensland Resources Council applauded the court\u2019s rejection of the original ACF challenge, saying it was a \u201cnonsense case\u201d akin to holding the Saudi Arabian government responsible for emissions from Australian cars running on their oil.</p> <p>The ACF argued Hunt had made an \u201cerror of law\u201d by not factoring in the impact of overseas \u201ccombustion\u201d of the coal over the 60-year life of the mine.</p> <p>Hunt had found it was \u201cnot possible to draw robust conclusions on the likely contribution of the project to a specific increase in global temperature\u201d.</p> <p>It was therefore \u201cdifficult to identify the necessary relationship between the taking of the action and any possible impacts on relevant matters of national environmental significance\u201d.</p> <p>Justice John Griffiths ruled it was \u201cplain that the minister did give consideration to greenhouse gas emissions resulting from the combustion emissions and made an express finding that the proposed action would not have an unacceptable impact on the world heritage values of the reef\u201d.</p> <p>Cousins said Griffiths had acknowledged \u201cconsiderable public interest\u201d in the case and ACF was \u201cin no doubt that we represent the concerns of the majority of Australians\u201d.</p> <p>He referred to a ReachTel survey of 2,600 Australians around the same time as the federal court ruling showing 81% backed stronger national environment laws and 75% backed environment groups\u2019 right to bring legal challenges to mining projects.</p> <p>\u201cAnd 75% support environment groups\u2019 right to use legal avenues to uphold existing environmental laws.</p> <p>\u201cIt comes down to this.

  "<h2><strong>\u2018What lies beyond the wall is worse than death. It is a wasteland. It is the end\u2019</strong></h2> <p>Finally, a really great episode! The show decided to stop being oblique about its intentions and murky about its existential philosophy and offered up a solid hour where themes of motherhood, family, imprisonment and faith reverberated throughout disparate storylines. Each storyline featured a major conflict between someone in power and a subordinate, in which the lesser person took control. The fights between Nick and Alejandro, Madison and Alicia, and Ofelia and the ghost of her mother signified that the next generation has to take over in order to survive.</p> <p>For Nick that means taking the best interests of the colony into his own hands, even if that isn\u2019t what Alejandro, the founder and leader, wants. When one family goes missing and the colony doesn\u2019t exchange Oxycontin for water with Marco and his gang at the supermarket, Nick knows the warlord will come looking for them. It takes a junkie to know a junkie. Alejandro doesn\u2019t let anyone leave and ends up in a quarrel with Nick, telling him he never asked to be put in a position of power and doesn\u2019t want it. He\u2019s also just waiting for some sort of spiritual awakening that he\u2019s convinced is on the horizon. </p> <p>Nick says: \u201cYou\u2019re waiting for faith to work, for the dead to wash the world clean. The danger is now. It\u2019s coming.\u201d</p> <p>Nick eventually goes behind Alejandro\u2019s back to attempt to make the meeting with Marco happen. His new lover Luci doesn\u2019t want him disobeying either her or Alejandro, so when Nick ventures out of the colony and Marco spots him on the rooftop, marking it as their home, he\u2019s going to be in very big trouble. </p> <h2><strong>\u2018I understand grief, but this is a bit extreme\u2019</strong></h2> <p>Eileen, the mother of zombie bride Jessica who Strand offed at the end of last episode, is so upset she knocks on his hotel door and stabs him right in the gut. And just when everything was going so well! They had planted crops, they got the generator working, there was even a clean bar, surfing lessons, and all the ice they could eat. It was like a regular Peroni commercial. </p> <p>In order to get medical supplies to save Strand, Elena takes Madison to Marco\u2019s Gang Supermarket and Looting Spoils Emporium. Elena\u2019s nephew Antonio is a member of the gang and she wants to trade with them, and maybe convince him to join his brother Hector back at the hotel. It would seem like the big event of this episode is the trip to the supermarket and the intel that Madison gets about Nick, but I think that isn\u2019t looking far enough into the future. The real big incident is when Madison locks up Eileen \u201cindefinitely\u201d for stabbing Strand and says that if anyone raises a hand to someone else, they get thrown out of the hotel. I have a feeling that pronouncement is going to come back to haunt her.</p> <h2><strong>\u2018I would have done anything for you. That is love\u2019</strong></h2> <p>Well, we finally figured out what happened to Ofelia \u2013 she took off in a pickup truck. Yup, that\u2019s it. Now she\u2019s off on her own, remembering the time that guy proposed to her and then moved to New Mexico and she decided to stay with her parents. But we already know how it ends because Ofelia told this story to Nick in a previous episode. Where was our spoiler alert? </p> <p>But it\u2019s not the fianc\u00e9 that\u2019s important, it\u2019s her mother. She recalls the conversation they had when her mother told her that her father had seen so many awful things he still had nightmares. She wanted to spare Ofelia from a life where she was a part of all that evil. Too bad she failed, because now everyone is living that life. But Ofelia\u2019s mom tells her that the way they managed was to stick together, and as Ofelia remembers this she says that she finally understands and drives her truck toward the US. Wait, does that mean she\u2019s going back to the hotel to be with her new \u201cfamily\u201d, or does that mean she\u2019s abandoning them? Is she going to look for her father who might still be alive? What is her decision?</p> <h2><strong>\u2018Turn it off. The whole world can see it\u2019 </strong></h2> <p>The biggest conflict of the episode, and the season really, is the one that has been slowly building between Alicia and Madison. Alicia feels like her mother has always neglected her to take care of her father and Nick. Madison returns from the supermarket frantic to find Nick. (Seriously, did she think that rushing a bunch of Mexican gang members for information about her \u201cratty-haired gringo\u201d son was a good idea?) She powers up the generator to turn on the sign at the top of the hotel, trying to signal to Nick but also signaling their presence to anyone who can see it. </p> <p>Alicia has to take control the situation and talk some sense into her mother. Earlier, in the van on the way to the supermarket, Madison told Elena not to give up on her nephew, who joined the gang and wouldn\u2019t come live at the hotel. She\u2019s speaking like the mother of a junkie who never gave up on her son. But Alicia lets her know that is time to give up. Nick chose to go live out in the chaos of the apocalypse and she can\u2019t sacrifice their safety in order to woo him back. Alicia has chosen to stay with her and make things work, and it\u2019s time that Madison make a home for her.</p> <p>She relents and shuts the sign off, but not before Travis, seemingly having left his own son behind, sees it and starts to make his way toward the hotel. Even the cliffhanger at the end was subtle but good. </p>",

She repeatedly told the Nauru police force she did not wish to make a statement.</p> <p>The report said the caseworkers had recommended that the woman be encouraged to speak to the police and were continuing to provide support to her.<br></p> <p>In another report a refugee said she had been spat on and repeatedly sexually harassed at a restaurant she managed in the Nauruan community.

In one report from February, a child refugee under 15 tried to jump off the balcony of his home in an attempt to kill himself. His father stopped him.

  "<p>The Somali American community in St Cloud, Minnesota, condemned on Sunday the mass stabbing attack at a mall the night before, as the immigrant population confronted longstanding tensions and unconfirmed reports emerged of the suspect\u2019s identity.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/18/minnesota-mass-stabbing-mall-fbi-terrorism-investigation\">FBI investigates Minnesota mass stabbing as 'potential act of terrorism'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Police have not yet named the suspect, who wounded nine people on Saturday night at the Crossroads Center mall, and whose attack <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/18/minnesota-mass-stabbing-mall-fbi-terrorism-investigation\">is being investigated as \u201cpotential act of terrorism\u201d</a>. But Ahhmed Adan, a Somali immigrant, told the Minneapolis Star Tribune on Sunday that police had told him the night before that his son, Dahir Adan, had died the night before. </p> <p>None of the nine injured people suffered life-threatening injuries, and the only fatality of the attack was the suspect, who was shot dead by an off-duty police officer.</p> <p>Police did not mention the attack on the mall, Adan said, but they seized photos and other materials from the family\u2019s apartment. Adan said his son came to the US 15 years ago and was a student at St Cloud Technical and Community College. He added that he had \u201cno suspicion\u201d that his son might have considered such an attack.<br></p> <p>Within hours of the attack, in which the suspect reportedly spoke of Allah, members of the Somali American community began to see anti-immigrant and Islamophobic messages directed toward them online. The virulence increased when an Islamic State-run news agency claimed credit for the attack; the terror group has previously claimed credit for attackers with whom it had no contact.</p> <p>A leader of the community, Abdul Kalane, said he fears how those online messages will translate into the real world, especially since Dahir Adan was his neighbor. Kalane said he had moved to a new building at the beginning of the month, and met Adan in the parking lot. Though he didn\u2019t know Adan well, he said he believed he was in his 20s and had moved to the United States at a young age.</p> <p>\u201cWhen I heard that the guy who did this was a member of the Somali community, I was so devastated, because I know what\u2019s going to happen. The repercussions, the retaliation,\u201d Kalane told the Guardian. \u201cI was shocked, because the guy lives in the same building I live in. And even though we don\u2019t know the full picture, we are actually devastated by this. It\u2019s really tragic.\u201d</p> <p>St Cloud is home to a growing Somali Muslim community, largely made up of refugees feeling the country\u2019s civil war. In January, the local paper <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.sctimes.com/story/news/local/immigration/2016/01/24/fact-check-somali-student-numbers/79062702/\">reported</a> that about 20% of St Cloud\u2019s students came from homes where the primary language spoken at home was Somali.</p> <p>Not everyone has been accepting of the new arrivals. Last year, Somali students at one local high school staged a walkout to protest discrimination after a Somali student was labeled as \u201cIsis\u201d on snapchat. A nonprofit called <a href=\"http://www.unitecloud.org\">#UniteCloud</a> later formed to help bridge the gap between the Somali community and the more established, mostly white St Cloud residents.</p> <p>Natalie Ringsmuth, a white Minnesotan who co-founded the group with Haji Yusuf, said they had long feared something like this could happen.</p> <p>\u201cA some point in our community, we knew that the tensions were so high that somebody from either side of the equation was going to commit an act of violence,\u201d she said. \u201cUnfortunately, we\u2019re here, but we\u2019ve mentally prepared for this.\u201d</p> <p>Somali community leaders held a press conference Sunday afternoon to plead to plead for unity. Activist Lul Hersi said she had feared for her one of her sons when she heard about the attack, and was relieved when he arrived home that night. She called it a \u201cdark day\u201d that the community would never forget.</p> <p>\u201cWe condemn the acts of yesterday. It was an individual and we don\u2019t know what motivated that individual,\u201d she said. \u201cLet\u2019s unite as one Minnesota. Let\u2019s take love instead of hate.\u201d</p> <p>Community leader Hassan Yussuf said he hoped the city\u2019s recent progress wouldn\u2019t be derailed. \u201cSt Cloud has done a lot of hard work to come together, all of the leaders, and that should not be broken by this incident,\u201d he said. \u201cThis incident should not be used to spread hate. It should be used to bring us together.\u201d</p> <p>Despite the absence of confirmed facts, at least one anti-immigrant group, <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/extremist-files/group/act-america\">Act! For America</a>, seized on the attack for political purposes. The group posted a link about the stabbings with a question: \u201cMore refugees, anyone?\u201d</p> <p>Jaylani Hussein, the executive director for the Minnesota chapter of the Council of American-Islamic Relations, said central Minnesota has a history of anti-Muslim organizing. He pointed to a string of incidents dating back years, including visits by <a href=\"http://www.startribune.com/anti-muslim-speaking-circuit-runs-through-rural-minnesota/375924701/\">well-known anti-Muslim speakers</a> and a<a href=\"http://www.startribune.com/anti-muslim-billboard-posted-near-st-cloud-taken-down/369177621/\"> recent billboard</a>, eventually removed, that read \u201cCatholic Charities Resettles Islamists, Evil or Insanity.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not just random people being upset and acting randomly. This is people who actually organize, who hold events, who hold meetings, who fundraise. They make sure everyone in their community is aware of what is going on,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Hussein, like many present, said he hoped the stabbings would help bring the community together. </p> <p>\u201cThere is tension, there is real concern, and this incident just magnifies everything that has happened here,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we hope, even this big of an incident can bring St Cloud residents who have not played a role in this discussion to start to take back the narrative from the extremes.\u201d</p> <p>Ringsmuth, too, thought the attack posed Minnesotans a choice. \u201cWe are at a crossroads in our community,\u201d she said. \u201cThis has broken us, we can either begins the road of healing together by choosing peace, or we can be broken even further, and that\u2019s up to us.\u201d</p>",

She appeared on a television talent contest and caught the eye of one of the judges, <a href=\"http://blogs.wsj.com/scene/2013/12/27/hong-kong-remembers-anita-mui/\">Anita Mui</a>, a Cantopop diva some called Asia\u2019s Madonna.</p> <p>\u201cShe took me in as one of her disciples,\u201d Ho recalls of how Mui, an outspoken artist who backed the 1989 Tiananmen protesters and died prematurely of cancer in 2003, helped kickstart her career.</p> <p>Nearly two decades later Ho has built a loyal following in her native Hong Kong, recording more than two dozen albums while simultaneously carving out a career as a television and film actress. In 2007 she provided the Cantonese voice-over for Bart Simpson in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2007/jul/24/animation.family\">The Simpsons Movie</a>. <br></p> <p>Until relatively recently, Ho had also been building a following over the border in mainland China, releasing her first Mandarin-language record, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzeCS9CJ-BQ\">Nameless Poem</a>, in 2010. By 2014, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/25/world/asia/hong-kong-stars-face-mainland-backlash-over-support-for-protests.html?_r=0\">the singer said</a> her mainland audience accounted for about 80% of her income. <br></p> <p>The outbreak of the umbrella movement \u2013 and Ho\u2019s decision to join its ranks \u2013 threatened to thwart the singer\u2019s attempts to break the lucrative mainland Chinese market.</p> <p>Incensed at the police\u2019s attempts to crush those demonstrations, Ho became a regular face at the protest camp. Along with fellow Cantopop star Anthony Wong she recorded <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=na2mR9mvDoU\">Raise your Umbrellas</a>, a song that would become one of the movement\u2019s anthems.</p> <p>\u201cStanding on the frontlines, we are filled with courage even though the future is grim,\u201d they sing in one verse. \u201cWho would have guessed that to see through the lies we must open our eyes in the smoke of teargas?\u201d</p> <p>Most local pop stars declined to join the protests for fear of angering Beijing and losing their access to the mainland, Jason Ng recalls in his book about the demonstrations, Umbrellas in Bloom.</p> <p>\u201c[But Wong and Ho] demonstrated their steely backbones by risking their careers for social justice, and at the same time amplified the deafening silence of all the other Cantopop stars who had gone missing in action,\u201d Ng writes.</p> <p>Challenging the Communist party so publicly was always likely to have a price. The South China Morning Post warned Ho was committing <a href=\"http://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/article/1634254/canto-pop-star-denise-ho-vows-fight-democracy-despite-mainland\"> \u201ccareer suicide\u201d</a> by standing up to Beijing. <br></p> <p>And sure enough the counter-attack came. <a href=\"http://news.xinhuanet.com/politics/2014-10/22/c_1112936392.htm\">One hostile editorial</a>, published by Xinhua, China\u2019s official news agency, backed calls for a boycott of artists such as Ho who had defied Beijing by taking to the streets. \u201cDon\u2019t think you can eat our food and smash our pots at the same time,\u201d it sniped. </p> <p>Earlier this year the attacks escalated after she <a href=\"http://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/politics/article/1944688/canto-pop-star-denise-ho-meets-dalai-lama\">met Beijing\u2019s nemesis, the Dalai Lama</a>, and posted a photograph on social media.

[But] that\u2019s not how it happens anywhere in the world, especially when you are facing such a big machine that is the Chinese Communist party.\u201d</p> <p>In fact, Ho describes the three-month-long protests as a historic awakening for the semi-autonomous city\u2019s youth, the first step on an uncertain but essential quest for democracy. </p> <p>\u201cThis generation has changed because of the umbrella movement, and I think that is something that nobody dreamed of ... for the past 30 or 40 years in Hong Kong,\u201d she says. <br></p> <p>For a while after the protests, Ho says she pondered running for a seat in LegCo, Hong Kong\u2019s 70-member legislature, to which <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/05/hong-kong-poll-pro-independence-activists-poised-to-win-seats-in-record-turnout\">a number of umbrella movement veterans</a>, including the <a href=\"http://time.com/4479970/hong-kong-nathan-law-legislature-demosisto-democracy/\">student leader Nathan Law</a>, were recently elected in what was seen as a stinging rebuke to Beijing.</p> <p>But the singer decided not to swap song-making for speech-writing, preferring to use her art to spread a message of hope and solidarity that might help heal the growing frustrations of Hong Kong\u2019s youth.</p> <p>\u201cWe have to think what comes after this rage,\u201d she says. \u201cFor me, going back to doing my music and putting these thoughts into songs ... that is my role, I think.\u201d<br></p>",
