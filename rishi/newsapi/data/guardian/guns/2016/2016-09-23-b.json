  "<p> The furrows deepened on the brow of Father Brian Lucas. His bouncy confidence evaporated in the witness box. He sweated under questioning. He confessed over and over again to be puzzled by his own actions. Puzzled by the actions of others. So puzzled. But he gave no ground.</p> <p> On one reading of this tangled story, Lucas could face possible criminal charges for failing to alert the police 24 years ago to the apparently frank confessions of a paedophile priest. He doesn\u2019t see it that way.</p> <p> Lucas put everything he had this week into convincing the royal commission into institutional responses to child sexual abuse that his handling of the case of Father John Farrell \u2013 who was abusing children from the moment he was ordained in 1981 \u2013 was absolutely proper. </p> <p> Lucas matters. Though he has no fancy title and doesn\u2019t wear lace, this lawyer priest has been a fixer of great skill within the Catholic church for decades. He has been one of the hard men in the church bureaucracy: for years the spokesman of the archdiocese of Sydney and then secretary to the Bishops\u2019 Conference. </p> <p> The Farrell case is the commission\u2019s last look at the role of the Catholic church. It\u2019s no afterthought. This is the scandal that raises the fundamental question of the church\u2019s attitude to Australian law. Is it a \u201cgood citizen\u201d as Cardinal George Pell has so often claimed? Or does the church see itself as a separate realm answerable to the laws of Rome? </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Lucas never took notes. No incriminating documents were left behind</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p> Lucas was the go-to man when paedophiles had to be persuaded to leave the church. Rules set in Rome made it essentially impossible to dismiss these men. They could be suspended from duties, given no work, forbidden to celebrate mass \u2013 but they had to consent to their own sacking. </p> <p> How many cases he had handled before he confronted Farrell he couldn\u2019t exactly say. Perhaps 35. He never turned them over to the police. And he never took notes. The ground rule of his operation was that no documents were left behind. </p> <p> Even in the witness box this week, Lucas insisted the church had a right to protect the confidences of these men. He argued to a clearly sceptical commissioner, Peter McClellan, that they spoke to him on condition no record was made, so no record was made. There was nothing for civil authorities to discover in the archives. Lucas called it the right to silence. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"093b35539147e2e0ff7c0cdfcb577e129cf3f38a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/093b35539147e2e0ff7c0cdfcb577e129cf3f38a/0_80_2832_1699/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Father Brian Lucas\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lawyer priest Father Brian Lucas has been a fixer of great skill within the Catholic church for decades.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dan Himbrechts/AAP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p> Lucas was not alone when he met Farrell in September 1992. With him were two senior churchmen: Monsignor John Usher, director of the Catholic charity Centacare, and the judicial vicar of the Armidale diocese, Father Wayne Peters. </p> <p> Peters made a document. </p> <p> Those three men already knew a good deal about Farrell and the trail of scandal he had left behind in his decade as a priest. After only a couple of years, he was forced out of his first parish, Moree in western New South Wales, pursued by angry parents and accusations he was abusing his altar boys. </p> <p> The church undertook no investigation. </p> <p> Farrell was charged in 1987 with five counts of indecent assault on one boy and six of sexual intercourse without consent. The church provided the priest with a fierce Sydney criminal QC, Chester Porter, to tear the victim to shreds in the witness box in Narrabri. Farrell wasn\u2019t committed for trial. </p> <p> He was then moved to western Sydney, where his abrasive attitudes, strange behaviour with children and sexual banter with altar boys led him to be shifted from Kenthurst to Merrylands and then thrown out of the diocese in June 1992. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/sep/06/catholic-church-to-use-late-ballarat-bishops-estate-to-help-abuse-victims\">Catholic church to use late Ballarat bishop's estate to help victims of abuse</a> </p> </aside>  <p> By any measure, Farrell was a bad man. Lucas also knew the priest had indecently assaulted a young girl who described to Lucas in great detail what Farrell had done to her: touching her legs and breasts. </p> <p> \u201cDid you refer that complaint to the police?\u201d asked counsel assisting the royal commission, Gail Furness. </p> <p> \u201cNo, she was very adamant she did not want that done.\u201d</p> <p> Lucas had a policy then of not encouraging victims to go to the police: not dissuading, but not encouraging. He explained to the commission that he preferred to take a neutral stance: \u201cI was nervous about putting too much pressure on someone.\u201d</p> <p> Farrell, cast adrift from Sydney, was keen to return to work in his old stamping ground, the diocese of Armidale. But a new bishop there, Kevin Manning, was wary. </p> <p> He called the priest in for a remarkable interview at which Farrell claimed to be innocent of the Narrabri charge. But according to the bishop\u2019s notes, \u201che referred to three other incidents which could have brought him \u201814 years apiece\u2019.\u201d</p> <p> Manning did not question Farrell, nor did he report the priest to the police. </p> <p> A couple of nights later, at Manning\u2019s request, Lucas, Usher and Peters confronted this recklessly confessional man in the presbytery of St Mary\u2019s Cathedral. Lucas told the royal commission: \u201cI would have explained the nature of the meeting, that this was confidential as between ourselves and the bishop, and that he should be able to speak freely.\u201d</p> <p> Just how freely and truthfully he spoke in that three-hour meeting is the key dispute in this grubby saga. No one took notes. The priest refused to go quietly. All he would agree to do was take leave from the church for five years. Lucas accepted that. Nothing at all was reported to the police. </p> <p> A few days later, Peters wrote a \u201cshort report\u201d to Manning. Lucas and Usher had no idea it had been written. It\u2019s only two and a half pages long but the details are dynamite. The bishop read it and he, too, failed to call the police. Instead, the report was left like a time bomb in the diocesan files. </p> <h2> Two suicides lead to Four Corners</h2> <p> Miracles happen. For 20 years Farrell remained a free man. Neither the church nor the police seemed curious about his depredations, not even after a few of his victims brought him to account. </p> <p> The young man destroyed in the witness box won a settlement from Catholic Church Insurance. A few years later he took his life. </p> <p> Another young man (known at the commission as CPK) began demanding money from Farrell. After handing over about $20,000, Farrell went to the police and the 19-year old was charged with demanding money with menaces.</p> <p> Peters\u2019 letter fell into the hands of CPK\u2019s lawyer. It arrived in a bundle of documents subpoenaed from the Armidale archdiocese. Though it was not admitted into evidence, it was shown to Farrell and he was questioned about it at CPK\u2019s trial in Parramatta in 2004. </p> <p> \u201cI suggest to you that at that meeting you made certain admissions to those priests that you had had oral sex with young boys. What do you say about that?\u201d</p> <p> \u201cYes,\u201d replied Farrell. </p> <p> \u201cAnd that\u2019s the reason why they won\u2019t let you carry out your duties as a priest, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p> <p> \u201cThat\u2019s part of it, yes.\u201d</p> <p> CPK told the police of Farrell fondling, fellating, masturbating and digitally penetrating him. He was acquitted. The police took no further action. CPK began civil proceedings and, in the course of reaching a settlement, the church finally compelled Farrell to resign from the priesthood. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It looks like you put your heads together to come up with a view that was in each of your own interests</p> <footer> <cite>Gail Furness, counsel assisting the royal commission</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p> CPK hanged himself in 2007. </p> <p> Still nothing happened to Farrell. Those suicides \u2013 both at the age of 28 \u2013 and the continuing immunity of the paedophile who preyed on those young men put the Farrell case high on the list of outrages pursued by Broken Rites, the support group for survivors of clerical abuse. </p> <p> It was a long haul, but in early 2012 ABC television\u2019s Four Corners became interested. How, the journalists wondered, could this man have made those admissions to the church in 1992 and to the court in 2004 with no charges ever being laid? How could the police and the church be so blind to his crimes?</p> <p> Four Corners made first contact with Lucas in late May 2012. The producer Mary Ann Jolley emailed wanting to know what happened at the 1992 meeting. Lucas immediately flicked her email to Usher. He also spoke to Peters. At one point Lucas organised a three-way conference call to prepare what he called a \u201ccommon recollection\u201d of the meeting in St Mary\u2019s Cathedral presbytery.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5018734325df8d6ea849db226d1f69d9ae129e9e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5018734325df8d6ea849db226d1f69d9ae129e9e/0_57_3134_1881/1000.jpg\" alt=\"John Usher (left)\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Monsignor John Usher, left, says Father John Farrell \u2018made no personal disclosures of criminal behaviour\u2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dan Himbrechts/AAP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p> \u201cIt looks,\u201d Furness suggested, \u201clike you put your heads together to come up with a view that was in each of your own interests.\u201d</p> <p> Lucas explained he was an expert handling the press and this was common operating procedure: \u201cWe were genuinely trying to be honest in the response.\u201d What had to be avoided was giving Four Corners three different versions of what happened at the 1992 meeting. </p> <p> So what, asked Furness? Wouldn\u2019t they be giving three honest recollections of a meeting now 20 years in the past? Again Lucas explained: the discrepancies would become the story and the result would be \u201cconfusion \u2026 total confusion\u201d.</p> <p> The three men agreed: Farrell made no admissions. </p> <p> Four Corners knew they were on to something for, as the journalists kept pressing, Lucas and Farrell tweaked the formula. Confusion was creeping in. The denials were no longer absolute. Lucas told the ABC the priest \u201cwas not specific with respect to any admissions\u201d. Usher said Farrell \u201cmade no personal disclosures of criminal behaviour\u201d.</p> <p> But they all agreed, there was nothing to tell the police. </p> <p> Pell fronted the camera. He looked the reporter Geoff Thompson in the eye and said: \u201cThe file note of that meeting does not show that he made any admission and that is the recollection of the three priests who were actually at that. They were dissatisfied with his credibility. They thought he represented some sort of danger for the future and although he made no admissions to them they suggested to the bishop who followed it that he be stood down.\u201d</p> <p> The cardinal had no file note of the meeting. He was referring to a briefing paper Usher had put together only days before. But from early in the research for the show, Four Corners was aware that a contemporaneous document did exist that gave an absolutely contrary account of the 1992 confrontation with Farrell. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/jul/27/cardinal-george-pell-calls-child-abuse-allegations-a-smear-campaign\">Cardinal George Pell calls child abuse allegations a smear campaign</a> </p> </aside>  <p> The problem was to find it. Weeks after Pell was interviewed and only a few days before the show went to air, Four Corners tracked down a copy of Peters\u2019 report among the court papers from the CPK case in Parramatta. </p> <p> The document was devastating. It recorded Farrell admitting \u201cthere had been five boys around the age of ten and eleven that he had sexually interfered with in varying degrees in the years approximately 1982 to 1984 while he was the assistant priest at Moree\u201d.</p> <p> Farrell also admitted fondling a boy\u2019s genitals \u201cduring a car trip from Moree to Narrabri\u201d and assaulting another two boys far more seriously: \u201cHe admitted that over a period of approximately twelve months he fondled the genitals of each of these boys and to quote \u2018sucked off their dicks\u2019. As far as Rev. Farrell can remember this was done on about a monthly basis \u2026\u201d</p> <h2>\u2018I have to stand by my letter\u2019</h2> <p> Four Corners called the show Unholy Silence. Its impact was enormous. Along with a handful of scandals that broke in mid-2012, the report was key to Julia Gillard\u2019s decision four months later to call the royal commission.</p> <p>In Victoria, police denounced the church for failing to hand paedophiles over for investigation. In the NSW Hunter Valley, a police whistleblower claimed Catholics among his colleagues were frustrating investigation of paedophile priests. And now in Sydney, it seemed that officials of the church had kept secret for 20 years highly detailed admissions of paedophile behaviour crimes.</p> <p>The common theme was the impression that the Catholic church saw itself standing outside the law. </p> <p>Lying to Four Corners \u2013 if indeed these were lies - is not a crime. But in NSW the ancient offence of misprision of felony survives in section 316 of the Crimes Act. The crime of concealing knowledge of a crime is punishable with up to two years\u2019 imprisonment.<br></p> <p> Within days of Four Corners going to air, the former NSW director of public prosecutions Nicholas Cowdery <a href=\"http://www.smh.com.au/nsw/clergy-could-face-charges-over-alleged-sex-coverup-20120704-21hnj.html\">told the Sydney Morning Herald</a> there were grounds to proceed against Lucas, Usher and Peters under section 316. He said: \u201cI can\u2019t, frankly, see any reason why it would not proceed.\u201d</p> <p> By this time, Pell\u2019s officials in Sydney had held urgent meetings with lawyers to look for a way out of this mess. File notes from these meetings have been in evidence before the royal commission. Lucas and Usher were not in the hot seat. Peters was. Why did he write the report? How did it get out? Was it accurate? </p> <p> \u201cIf that is what I wrote,\u201d said Peters, \u201cI have to stand by my letter.\u201d </p> <p> Peters left the room. A combative Lucas came on the line from America. According to the minutes he had a plan. \u201cHe would talk to Mgr Peters about the letter and the need for him to include that he had embellished it. He said that in the context of time this would be understandable. That would be the end of it and \u2018gets him off the hook\u2019. This is the only way \u2018to clear this up and explain things\u2019.\u201d</p> <p> This troubled Danny Casey, the business manager of the archdiocese and Pell\u2019s right-hand man. When he suggested this course was imprudent, Lucas slapped him down. The minutes record: \u201cBL responded that he had 25 years of media experience (and was not inclined to take advice from DC).\u201d</p> <p> The Sydney archdiocese put out a press release the same day to announce Lucas and Usher were holding their ground. Lucas was not its author, but under questioning at the royal commission he conceded the release made a series of claims that were not right \u2013 among them that: </p> <ul> <li>Lucas and Usher \u201cseparately told\u201d the ABC no admissions were made<br></li> <li>Peters\u2019 letter to his bishop was \u201cnot an official record\u201d of the meeting<br></li> <li>the Church\u2019s Professional Standards Office held \u201cnotes of the meeting\u201d.<br></li> </ul> <p> Lucas conceded all were wrong. The Professional Standards Office didn\u2019t even exist in 1992. </p> <p> Furness finished questioning Lucas about the release by ridiculing a flourish of rhetoric about the continuing commitment of the archdiocese to \u201cbringing sexual abuse to light\u201d. Wasn\u2019t the opposite result achieved by the machinations of the church in these weeks? Lucas replied: \u201cI accept that.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The explicit description of that appalling behaviour would have been seared in my memory</p> <footer> <cite>Father Brian Lucas</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p> The church now pursued a familiar strategy: hiring a former judge to conduct a private inquiry into an embarrassing scandal. Antony Whitlam QC began work a fortnight after the Four Corners show to report on the church\u2019s management of Farrell from his earliest days in the seminary until he finally threw in the towel in 2005. </p> <p> Whitlam would excoriate the failings of the church, particularly its failure to investigate Farrell\u2019s crimes and to properly protect children in the various parishes to which this obviously dangerous priest was sent. </p> <p> But the former federal court judge came to a curious conclusion about the 1992 meeting. He found that Farrell\u2019s talk that night was essentially fantasy. The priest was not confessing to his invigilators but \u201cspeaking in some detail about sexual fantasies\u201d. </p> <p> The royal commission\u2019s inquiry into the Farrell scandal is, among other things, a review of Whitlam\u2019s findings \u2013 particularly his conclusion that there was \u201cno cover-up\u201d in 1992 and \u201cnothing sinister\u201d in the gulf of recollection that separated Peters on one side from Lucas and Usher on the other. </p> <p> Furness probed this issue for days, taking Lucas and Usher in detail through all the accounts of the meeting they have given over the years \u2013 to the ABC, the church, Whitlam and, in Usher\u2019s case, to the NSW police. </p> <p> Lucas held his ground. He still maintains no useful admissions were made by Farrell and that Peters\u2019 letter is not accurate. \u201cThe explicit description of that appalling behaviour,\u201d he told the commission, \u201cwould have been seared in my memory \u2013 those explicit words \u2013 and I did not hear them.\u201d</p> <p> Usher gave ground. He won\u2019t endorse Peters\u2019 language and doesn\u2019t accept he wrote a fair account of that fateful meeting, but under close questioning from Furness he agreed that Farrell might well have said what Peters recorded him saying. But that was no reason to believe him. </p> <p> \u201cFarrell raved on about many things,\u201d Usher said. \u201cIt is not inconceivable that Wayne Peters heard some of this stuff and believed that he was making admissions about things when, in fact, he was just raving on about many, many aberrations, fantasies and \u2018What people say about me\u2019.\u201d</p> <p> Whitlam ultimately accepted that argument. Furness is sceptical. She was keen to trace its origins. She noted it first appeared only after Four Corners had gone to air. She took Usher through document after document from 1992 that suggested whatever had or had not been said at the fateful meeting, everyone took Farrell seriously. </p> <p> \u201cNow, is it the case, Father, that you have constructed him as rambling, bizarre, et cetera, because that\u2019s the only way you have sought to explain Father Peters\u2019 letter? </p> <p> \u201cNo, no,\u201d replied Usher. \u201cHe was strange and bizarre.\u201d</p> <h2>Farrell sentenced \u2013 and more charges laid</h2> <p>Immediately after Four Corners went to air, the NSW police established Strike Force Glenroe with detectives from the NSW Sex Crimes Squad and the New England and Barwon local area command to investigate Farrell\u2019s crimes. There would be those who said this move came 20 years late.</p> <p> Once the first charges were laid in October 2012, Farrell was protected by non-publication orders and the pseudonym Father F. They were lifted in May this year when he was sentenced for 62 historical sex crimes against children, with a further 17 offences taken into account. The sentence was 29 years. </p> <p> A few weeks ago, Strike Force Glenroe laid further charges relating to child sex assaults in the 1970s and 1980s. That trial is set down for April. </p> <p> Usher told the royal commission he had been interviewed by detectives from Strike Force Glenroe. \u201cThey told me that \u2026 the DPP had asked them to investigate this Farrell matter to see whether I, and others, had failed to report matters to the police.\u201d</p> <p> Though Peters was placed under great pressure, he never backed away from his letter. He would not declare it was embellished. Furness assured the commission that under questioning by Whitlam, \u201che said he stood by the letter as being accurate\u201d. In the aftermath of the scandal, Peters drank heavily and died in February last year. </p> <p> Whitlam is suing the ABC for, he says, accusing him on the 7.30 program in May this year of conducting a \u201csham\u201d inquiry and being a \u201cstooge\u201d of the Catholic church. A case management conference is set down for 10 October. </p> <p> The commission seems not to have finished with the Farrell scandal. Furness announced that this week\u2019s adjournment was to allow \u201cfurther inquiries that those assisting the royal commission wish to make\u201d.</p>",

Obama cited the potential for the popular bipartisan bill to backfire against the US, its diplomats and military personnel. The bill sailed through both chambers of Congress by voice vote, with final House passage coming just two days before Obama led the country in marking the 15th anniversary of the attacks that killed nearly 3,000 people in New York, Washington and Pennsylvania on 11 September 2001.</li> <li>Billionaire casino owner Sheldon Adelson plans to donate as much as $25m to a Super Pac supporting Donald Trump \u2013 more than five times what he had been expected to contribute.

He writes on his site The Insurgent, <a href=\"http://theresurgent.com/evan-mcmullin-a-sane-alternative/\">calling McMullin the \u201csane alternative\u201d</a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The reality is Evan McMullin\u2019s candidacy is a long shot. His best shot is winning a few states to throw the race to the House of Representatives where, though he may not get the Presidency, he might ensure neither Trump nor Hillary get it. To do this he would have to win a few blue states, which though difficult is not impossible. Surprisingly, he is already beginning to register in polls in red states like Utah and purple states like Virginia.</p> <p>Frankly, Evan McMullin may actually serve a more important role in 2016. Though he may not win, he might at least provide disaffected conservatives an excuse to show up and vote down ballot. Saving the Senate and House of Representatives from the Democrats has to be a priority for conservatives, but many are so disgusted by 2016 that they will not even show up in November.</p> <p>McMullin gives people a reason to show up. He gives conservatives someone they can vote for without holding their nose. He gives people someone to vote for instead of reconciling themselves to voting against someone. McMullin\u2019s candidacy is not the lesser of an evil, but an alternative against evil. For many, that will be enough.</p> <p>A lot of people have been writing me, begging me to reconsider Donald Trump. They think this is the last best chance to get this nation right. They think we will turn a corner after which we cannot turn back. In truth, I have concluded we are already past the point of redemption when the best either party can do is offer up Clinton or Trump. We are beyond the point of looking to five black robed masters to save us from ourselves when we put up either a Clinton or a Trump. The seriousness and virtue of the voter is in the grave already and too many yearn for an idolized past that never existed in a future that is not theirs, but God\u2019s, to shape.</p> <p>I am realistic that Evan McMullin has a limited change of winning. But I am idealistic enough to hope for better than Clinton or Trump.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57e56cf1e4b0831a51401a9f\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-23T18:08:54.763Z\">7.08pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>More rumors are swirling around that Ted Cruz will shortly endorse Donald Trump for president, with <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2016/09/trump-rival-cruz-to-throw-support-to-gop-nominee-228584\">Politico reporting</a> that \u201cmultiple sources close to Cruz\u201d say it is coming as early as today.</p> <p>Cruz and Trump had a particularly brutal primary fight, with Trump insinuating that Cruz\u2019s father was involved in the assassination of John F Kennedy and that his wife was unattractive.</p> <p>As Politico reports:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It is unclear whether Cruz will say only that he is voting for the Republican nominee, as other lawmakers have done, or offer a more full-throated endorsement, but the idea of throwing any support to Trump is controversial within Cruzworld.</p> <p>\u201cIf he announces he endorses, it destroys his political brand,\u201d said someone who had worked for Cruz\u2019s campaign.</p> </blockquote> <p>A former Cruz backer, conservative radio host Steve Deace, is tweeting his disappointment at news that the Texas Senator may back the party\u2019s controversial nominee.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/SteveDeaceShow/status/779367746874269696\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">I hope I&#39;m wrong, but I think a man I admire will today make the worst political miscalculation I&#39;ve ever witnessed.</p>&mdash; Steve Deace (@SteveDeaceShow) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SteveDeaceShow/status/779367746874269696\">September 23, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/SteveDeaceShow/status/779374466191196161\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">I really hope the Cruz advisers that pressured him for months to do this know their base as well as they seem to think they do.</p>&mdash; Steve Deace (@SteveDeaceShow) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SteveDeaceShow/status/779374466191196161\">September 23, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/SteveDeaceShow/status/779369211860815872\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">People may love Cruz endorsing Trump.

Its challenge, say Clinton campaign advisers, is to match and thwart the way terrorism has transitioned from large-scale attacks directed by established terrorist groups to small-scale assaults by unconnected, self-radicalized perpetrators that are comparatively difficult to detect.</p> <p>Overseas, the Clinton campaign discusses the intelligence surge in terms of accelerating a focus on the Middle East.</p> <p>It seeks to expand intelligence sharing, particularly across European governments hindered by the lack of a continental intelligence infrastructure, concerning flows of jihadists, money and weapons.</p> <p>And it will support an intensified hunt for Baghdadi expending \u201csignificant resources\u201d, reminiscent of Barack Obama\u2019s successful push to find and kill al-Qaida leader Osama bin Laden.</p> <p>\u201cShe really would put a concerted focus on that, really going after him in particular,\u201d said Laura Rosenberger, a senior Clinton foreign policy adviser and former state department and National Security Council official.</p> <p>Read the rest <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/23/hillary-clinton-national-security-plan-isis-baghdadi\">here</a>.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/23/hillary-clinton-national-security-plan-isis-baghdadi\">Hillary Clinton's plan to stop Isis: hunt down leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi</a> </p> </aside> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57e507cae4b0f91912fb0446\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-23T12:35:51.099Z\">1.35pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Hello and welcome to our live-wire coverage of the 2016 race for the White House. </p> <h2>Humbling at Hofstra?</h2> <p>Preparation for Monday\u2019s first presidential debate at Hofstra University in New York means a fairly quiet Friday, with no official events planned for either Donald Trump or Hillary Clinton. </p> <p>Instead, it\u2019s debate prep day.</p> <p>For Clinton that means less mock debate and more conversations about how to handle the different forms of possible Trump attacks, with the motto of prepare, prepare, prepare, <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2016/09/hillary-clinton-debate-prep-228558\">says Politico</a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>In the end, it might not be anything Clinton says that matters.

If it was, then it could \u201cimprove the quality of services, increase access to services, and help people have a greater say over the services they use and who provides them\u201d.</p> <p>But recent changes (I won\u2019t use \u201creform\u201d because it\u2019s a value-positive term which pre-judges the idea we are debating) have not been well designed. </p> <p>In the case of vocational education and training, for example, changes started by Labor in 2009 and expanded by the Coalition in 2012 led to rampant rorting of billions of dollars of taxpayer funds by get-rich-quick shysters who preyed on the most disadvantaged.</p> <p>Employment services, which the Howard government turned into a competitive market 20 years ago, are often held up as a successful case study. But successive studies have shown this has been most successful in getting jobs for unemployed people who are pretty well placed to get jobs anyway, and least successful for the most disadvantaged job seekers, who regularly report receiving extremely poor services.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/20/australia-does-not-have-a-welfare-problem-we-have-a-poverty-problem\">Australia does not have a welfare problem.

For that reason, it\u2019s a bit easier [for Guardiola] to impose his way.\u201d City underachieved and finished fourth last season. Chelsea capitulated, and did so to the extent that a 10th-place finish represented recovery. There is a determination about Conte that suggests he will eventually succeed in south-west London.</p> <p>What his fledgling tenure needs now is its own statement of intent, an eye-catching display against a true contender to set the standard and reestablish this team\u2019s credentials. Perhaps that is why he has been tempted into recalling Cesc F\u00e0bregas against the midfielder\u2019s former club as a player whose inventive and offensive abilities can coax the best from Diego Costa, so often the scourge of Arsenal. F\u00e0bregas\u2019s is a proactive selection, the kind instigated by a manager taking the initiative.</p> <p>Asked if he felt opponents had started to sense a nervousness to Chelsea\u2019s defending this season, Conte had replied: \u201cIf they think this, they must also think we can score a lot of goals.\u201d The pragmatist in him is playing up his side\u2019s immediate strengths because eradicating their weaknesses is a work in progress.</p> <p>Yet, as the Premier League gauges the true threat posed by Chelsea this year, the Italian\u2019s biggest challenge may be striking a balance between imposing his style while maintaining results to satisfy the owner. With the focus returning so regularly to Wenger, it was only a matter of time before Conte was asked the inevitable question: would he like to emulate the Frenchman and be in charge at Stamford Bridge for 20 years? The predictable wave of chuckles swept around the room, those present well aware of this club\u2019s trigger\u2011happy reputation, but the only person who did not crack into a smile was the incumbent manager.</p> <p>\u201cWhen you can organise and do your work, and there is great satisfaction on both sides,\u201d he offered, \u201cthen there is the possibility.\u201d He has work to do.</p>",
  "<p>Patrick van Aanholt and his Sunderland team-mates have been warned not to smoke shisha pipes and advised that being caught doing so will result in heavy fines.</p> <p>David Moyes was \u201cnot impressed\u201d by newspaper pictures of Van Aanholt apparently smoking such a hookah at a central Newcastle shisha lounge this summer and has made it clear that he will not countenance any repeats.</p> <p>Quite apart from the potential health risks \u2013 the <a href=\"https://www.bhf.org.uk/heart-health/risk-factors/smoking/shisha\" title=\"\">British Heart Foundation claims one shisha session can be the equivalent of smoking more than 100 cigarettes</a> \u2013 Sunderland\u2019s manager feels that Van Aanholt was setting an awful example and has reminded his left-back that, like it or not, he is a role model. \u201cI don\u2019t expect a player playing for me to do that,\u201d Moyes said. \u201cI have had a word with him.

I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a good thing for our younger supporters to see. I wouldn\u2019t want to let my kids ever see me do that, not that I would.\u201d</p> <p>Moyes is particularly irritated by what he regards as Van Aanholt\u2019s extraordinary irresponsibility given that the Dutchman has a heart irregularity which, although currently well under control and causing him no problems, requires regular monitoring.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/20/patrick-van-aanholt-sunderland-heart-scan\">Patrick van Aanholt claims heart scare \u2018is really nothing to worry about\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Indeed only last Sunday, the 26-year-old was withdrawn from Sunderland\u2019s team for the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/18/tottenham-hotspur-sunderland-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">1-0 defeat at Tottenham Hotspur</a> at the last minute after a cardiologist queried his latest test results. Despite further checks this week eliminating such potential concerns, Moyes conceded that he does not know if Van Aanholt\u2019s recreational habits could have affected his health.</p> <p>Sunderland\u2019s manager \u2013 who has rejected an invitation to bolster his attack by signing the free agent Emmanuel Adebayor \u2013 added that he regards such conduct as entirely unsuitable for professional athletes, saying that past criticism provoked when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/apr/14/raheem-sterling-liverpool-brendan-rodgers-showdown-jordon-ibe-smoking\" title=\"\">Raheem Sterling</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/feb/04/jack-wilshere-smoking-pictured-shisha-pipe-arsenal\" title=\"\">Jack Wilshere</a> were, separately, picture smoking shisha was fully justified. \u201cPlayers have to be super-fit nowadays but it\u2019s a short career and you earn really good money, it\u2019s a great life. So, you know something? It\u2019s not too big a deal just to make sure you look after yourself for the time you\u2019re playing.\u201d</p> <p>Moyes could certainly do with his team being in optimal condition as they seek to secure his first Premier League victory since succeeding Sam Allardyce, at Crystal Palace\u2019s expense on Saturday. With West Bromwich Albion visiting the Stadium of Light next Saturday, Palace is the first of two potentially winnable home matches which the former Everton, Manchester United and Real Sociedad manager hopes will belatedly kick-start Sunderland\u2019s season.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re in rough seas at the moment,\u201d he said. \u201cBut if we can take points from these two games we can get into smoother waters.\u201d</p>",

  "<p>The controversy around Sir Bradley Wiggins\u2019s use of a banned corticosteroid before three major stage races deepened on Friday night when his former team doctor at the Garmin team, Prentice Steffen, questioned the practice in an interview with the BBC\u2019s Newsnight programme. Both Wiggins and his team at the time, Team Sky, have stated that he was given injections of triamcinolone acetate to treat a legitimate medical condition and that no anti-doping rules were broken.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/sep/23/bradley-wiggins-doping-rules-fancy-bears-tues\">Bradley Wiggins operated within doping rules \u2013 but rules may be wrong | Richard Williams</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Steffen was the team doctor at Garmin in 2009 when Wiggins made his breakthrough performance at the Tour de France, finishing fourth overall and subsequently being upgraded to third after Lance Armstrong was found guilty of doping. At that time Wiggins had therapeutic use exemptions permitting the use of an asthma inhaler containing salbutamol, a practice that has since been made legal.</p> <p>Steffen told Newsnight: \u201cI was surprised to see that there were TUEs documented for intramuscular triamcinolone just before three major events.\u201d</p> <p>The TUEs, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/sep/15/chris-froome-defends-use-tues-wada-hacking-leaks\" title=\"\">leaked through the hacking website</a> Fancy Bears on 15 September, were issued shortly before the 2011 and 2012 Tours de France \u2013 the latter an event that Wiggins won \u2013 and the 2013 Giro d\u2019Italia, where he abandoned.</p> <p>\u201cYou do have to think it is kind of coincidental that a big dose of intramuscular long-acting corticosteroids would be needed at that exact time before the most important race of the season,\u201d said Steffen. \u201cI would certainly say now it does not look good, it doesn\u2019t look right from a health or a sporting perspective.\u201d</p> <p>Steffen worked at the US Postal Service team in the mid-1990s, before Lance Armstrong joined them, and subsequently spoke out against the team and Armstrong over doping. Speaking to Newsnight he called upon cycling\u2019s governing body, the UCI, to act over TUEs, adding: \u201cI would say that Bradley is probably at the bottom of the list to be held personally responsible.</p> <p>\u201cI think his doctor and his team, to make the decision to apply for that TUE, is questionable and then I think for the UCI or UK cycling or Wada to sign off on that application, all things considered that is the end point where the TUE committee should have looked at that and said, no, this is not acceptable so we are not going to approve it.\u201d</p> <p>Team Sky said at the time of the leaks \u2013 which confirmed that Chris Froome had TUEs in 2013 and 2014 to take tablets containing the corticosteroid prednisolone \u2013 that \u201capplications for TUEs have all been managed and recorded in line with the processes put in place by the governing bodies.\u201d</p> <p>A statement on behalf of Wiggins following the leaks read: \u201cEveryone knows Brad suffers from asthma, his medical treatment is British Cycling and International Cycling Union approved and like all Team GB athletes he follows Wada regulations to the letter.\u201d</p> <p>Amidst details of Wiggins\u2019s treatment and the development of the allergy, the TUE application forms leaked by Fancy Bears stated that the 2012 Tour winner\u2019s TUEs were issued to treat \u201clife long allergy to pollen nasal congestion/rhinorrhoea, known allergy to grass pollen, sneezing throat irritation, wheezing leading to dysnopnoea eye watering runny nose.\u201d</p> <p>Newsnight also spoke to the Dane Michael Rasmussen, who has confessed to using a variety of banned drugs during his career plus practices such as blood doping. Asked to comment on Wiggins\u2019s TUEs, Rasmussen said: \u201cJust looking at the drugs and looking at the dates of the injections it looks very much like something that could have happened 10 years ago when I was riding for general classification in the Tour de France. If you look solely at the pattern of TUEs, this looks very suspicious. It\u2019s something that I would do, that I did.\u201d</p> <p>During his time at the Dutch Rabobank team, Rasmussen worked with Geert Leinders, a Belgian doctor who went on to work at Team Sky on a freelance basis in 2011 and 2012 after the team had dropped an initial policy of not hiring medics with a background in professional cycling.</p> <p>Both Team Sky and Wiggins\u2019s spokespeople have stated categorically the rider\u2019s TUEs were not requested by Dr Leinders. Wiggins\u2019s representatives did not respond to questions from Newsnight,</p> <p>Asked to describe the effects of using triamcinolone \u2013 which is widely used to treat inflammation of various kinds \u2013 both Rasmussen and another self-confessed drug-taker, the Briton David Millar, agreed that it was a potent performance-enhancing substance. Describing the effect of using Kenacort \u2013 one of the names under which triamcinolone is sold \u2013 and calling for it to be banned, Millar said, \u201cit was the only [drug] you took and three days later you looked different. It\u2019s quite scary because it\u2019s catabolic so it\u2019s eating into you. It felt destructive. It felt powerful.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>The acclaimed modern-day western <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/may/16/hell-or-high-water-review-cannes-film-jeff-bridges-chris-pine\">Hell or High Water<em> </em></a>may pivot on a conflict between disenfranchised brothers (Chris Pine and Ben Foster), Texas law men (Jeff Bridges and Gil Birmingham) and the corporate Man-at-large. However, it\u2019s driven less by traditional action theatrics than by people sitting, surveying their space, drinking in their perverted, disappointing patch of Americana. The film is self-consciously mythic, and that\u2019s why it\u2019s poignant: it <em>wants </em>to be a great and timely western. Watching Hell or High Water, it\u2019s hard not to think of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/apr/14/the-last-picture-show-review\">The Last Picture Show</a>, which featured a younger Bridges on the other side of his career, and which was similarly eager to conjure the iconography of an America thought to be long gone \u2013 a so-called \u201cpurer\u201d America, perhaps. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/may/16/hell-or-high-water-review-cannes-film-jeff-bridges-chris-pine\">Hell or High Water review \u2013 elegiac Texan western that packs a dizzying punch</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Hell or High Water<em> </em>is unusually engaging because it lingeringly allows us to regard protagonists and antagonists alike as the actors stew in their characters\u2019 regret, exuding cinematic charisma. Bridges is a legend, though this film inspires us to take that legend-hood less for granted, as he\u2019s getting on in years. Pine grows fully into his hunkiness for the first time, revealing inner mournfulness that proves there\u2019s professional life for him after he escapes the straitjacket of Captain Kirk. Foster informs his schtick-acting with pathos, and Birmingham quietly steals the movie as a biracial Native American/Mexican navigating an insane Caucasian world. </p> <p>The film involves two mirroring pairs \u2013 robbers and cops \u2013 and a confidently streamlined structure, alternating between the pairs as they banter through violent and comic chaos. It\u2019s the humor that keeps the film from turning into warmed-over <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/cormac-mccarthy\">Cormac McCarthy</a>; at its heart, it knows that its tormented man\u2019s kabuki is a little silly. The exhilaration of Hell or High Water<em> </em>depends partially on contrast: it\u2019s a late-summer film that actually relies on acting and direction. Director David Mackenzie doesn\u2019t lean on an impersonally huge scale as a crutch. The sight of Bridges with his booted feet propped up on a dusty fire extinguisher is more thrilling than frenetically edited images of, say, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/may/19/captain-america-civil-war-blockbuster-moviegoer-experience\">50 superheroes flying about</a>, with occasional cutaways to the visages of the famous actors ostensibly playing them, or of this weekend\u2019s computer-animated mass apocalypse du jour. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c55603c7e134c1e119b686400ab95400c0eca859\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c55603c7e134c1e119b686400ab95400c0eca859/0_0_2880_1968/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jane Levy in Don\u2019t Breathe: executed with poetic precision.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"683\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jane Levy in Don\u2019t Breathe: executed with poetic precision.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/Sony Pictures Releasing</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/aug/24/dont-breathe-review-horror-fede-alvarez-house-robbery\">Don\u2019t Breathe</a> revels in similarly unexpected competency. There are few genres less respected than horror films aimed at the youth market, but director Fede Alvarez shares Mackenzie\u2019s pride in meat-and-potatoes craftsmanship. The story is nearly as oft-told as the one governing Hell or High Water: a home is invaded, and cat-and-mouse negotiations arise between the owner and the interlopers in fashions that most obviously recall <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0062467/\">Wait Until Dark</a> and <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0258000/\">Panic Room</a>. The twist is that our sympathies are aligned with the interlopers, as the home\u2019s owner is an ageing blind loner, played by Stephen Lang, who is revealed to be a common enough kind of bogeyman: the insane war veteran. The Vietnam war was good to the American horror movie once upon a time, and the endless chain of nesting wars in the Middle East is paying the genre similar dividends. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/aug/24/dont-breathe-review-horror-fede-alvarez-house-robbery\">Don\u2019t Breathe review \u2013 a clever, gross master class in tension</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Don\u2019t Breathe and Hell or High Water have a number of things in common. They dramatize an entire country\u2019s collective anxiety \u2013 over stagnant wages, disappearing homes, racism, classism \u2013 through the sight of a few people standing in the frame at any given time, following actors as they reconfigure into various groupings with poetic precision. The dilapidated Detroit of Don\u2019t Breathe, borrowed from <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0103919/\">Candyman</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/feb/26/it-follows-review-horror-sex-death\">It Follows</a>, serves the same purpose as the hopeless Texan vistas of Hell or High Water: they are the hells our desperate antiheroes wish to escape, and standing between them and their qualified, bare-minimum dreams are ageing boomers. </p> <p>These films remind us that one is a more dramatic figurative number than 1,000,000. Or that a handful of characters can register more vividly than dozens. A small number is intimate; a large number is often vague. This is why the story of the murder of a single human being can be more dramatic than the reporting of a massacre; it\u2019s why a controversy over emails can damage a presidential candidate, while their opponent remains unscathed by a head-spinning onslaught of hourly atrocities that serve to cancel themselves out. </p> <p>But will Hollywood learn this truth, and does it need to? There were a great number of bombs this summer that embodied the usual more-is-much-less remake/sequel fever, but Marvel and Disney films continue to pay dividends that embarrass the impressive yet modest success of Hell or High Water and Don\u2019t Breathe, plus <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/jul/28/bad-moms-review-mila-kunis-kathryn-hahn-kristen-bell-the-hangover\">Bad Moms</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/jul/19/lights-out-review-david-sandberg-horror-film\">Lights Out</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/jun/23/the-shallows-review-blake-lively-shark-thriller-jaume-collet-serra\">The Shallows</a> in the eyes of studio executives. Chasing Marvel dollars, studios are embracing increasingly vast, obliging, inelegantly bloated narrative models that resolutely fail to marvel. One often exits a contemporary blockbuster in a numbed, sugar-addled blur. Hell or High Water and Don\u2019t Breathe reconnect one with the primal conventional pleasures of mainstream adult cinemagoing. They eat like a meal. </p>",
  "<p>The future of Yahoo, once the darling of the internet, was plunged into crisis on Thursday following the revelation that it has suffered the biggest data hack in history \u2013 and took two years to notice.<br></p> <p>Yahoo, which was worth $125bn at the height of the dotcom bubble in 1999, was forced to reveal \u201cstate sponsored\u201d hackers had stolen data from more than half a billion people across the world. </p> <p>The data loss, which happened in 2014 but was only recently discovered, is a huge embarrassment to Yahoo and has raised doubts over the future of the 22-year-old firm. The company, whose services are still regularly used by millions of older internet users but has become increasingly irrelevant for younger people, had recently found a saviour in mobile phone giant Verizon which is in the process of buying it for $4.8bn. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/sep/23/yahoo-questinos-hack-researchers\">Yahoo faces questions after hack of half a billion accounts</a> </p> </aside>  <p>However Verizon, which is one of America\u2019s biggest companies, stunned the business world by revealing that Yahoo executives only admitted the data breach two days ago, despite inking the deal in July. The company refused to offer any public reassurance that it would press ahead with the takeover given news of the hack. </p> <p>\u201cWithin the last two days, we were notified of Yahoo\u2019s security incident,\u201d Verizon said in a statement. \u201cWe understand that Yahoo is conducting an active investigation of this matter, but we otherwise have limited information and understanding of the impact. We will evaluate as the investigation continues through the lens of overall Verizon interests, including consumers, customers, shareholders and related communities. Until then, we are not in position to further comment.\u201d<br></p> <p>The hack, which affected roughly half of all of Yahoo\u2019s users, has raised serious questions about Yahoo\u2019s security and its executives ability to deal with the fallout. Victims include millions of British BT and Sky customers, as those companies outsourced their email services to Yahoo.</p> <p>Yahoo first found out about the security breach when <a href=\"http://motherboard.vice.com/read/yahoo-supposed-data-breach-200-million-credentials-dark-web\">Vice journalist Joseph Cox </a>contacted the company on 30 July to warn it that the data was being offered around for sale. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/josephfcox/status/779403501550104576\">Cox told the Guardian </a>that: \u201cSources in the data trading community sent me the sample before the listing [for the sale of the data] was put up [on the dark web]\u201d. </p> <p>Shortly after Cox warned Yahoo about the existence of the data, some of it was listed for sale on black-market dark website the Real Deal Marketplace for sale for for three bitcoins (about $1,860). The listing was posted by a notorious cybercriminal known as \u201cPeace\u201d, who had previously sold dumps of MySpace and LinkedIn data. </p> <p>Yahoo said it was aware of the \u201cclaimed\u201d data hack in July. At the time it said Yahoo was \u201ccommitted to protecting the security of our users\u2019 information and we take any such claim very seriously. Our security team is working to determine the facts\u201d.</p> <p>US politicians attacked Yahoo for not acting faster to warn users, who will have to change not just their Yahoo password but also any linked accounts which could include social media profiles, photo album sites and financial services. Yahoo reassured users that their credit card details should be safe as they are stored in a different system to the one exposed in the hack.</p> <p>\u201cWhile its scale puts it among the largest on record, I am perhaps most troubled by news that this breach occurred in 2014, and yet the public is only learning details of it today,\u201d Democratic senator Mark Warner said. \u201cAction from Congress to create a uniform data breach notification standard so that consumers are notified in a much more timely manner is long overdue.\u201d</p> <p>Senator Richard Blumenthal, also a Democrat, called for an official investigation to determine \u201cwhether Yahoo may have concealed its knowledge of this breach in order to artificially bolster its valuation in its pending acquisition by Verizon\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cIf Yahoo knew about the hack as early as August, and failed to coordinate with law enforcement, taking this long to confirm the breach is a blatant betrayal of their users\u2019 trust,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Yahoo\u2019s chief information security officer, Bob Lord, said: \u201cYahoo is working closely with law enforcement on this matter.</p> <p>\u201cOnline intrusions and thefts by state-sponsored actors have become increasingly common across the technology industry,\u201d the company added.</p> <p>\u201c<a href=\"https://help.yahoo.com/kb/account/SLN27925.html?impressions=true\">Yahoo encourages</a> users to review their online accounts for suspicious activity and to change their password and security questions and answers for any other accounts on which they use the same or similar information used for their Yahoo account,\u201d the company said in an email to users.</p> <p>Yahoo\u2019s boss, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/marissa-mayer\">Marissa Mayer</a>, could collect a total of $137m if she leaves the company following the sale to Verizon. Mayer has taken home $78m since she was installed as CEO in 2012, and if she leaves the company after a buyout she is on course for another $59m, based on the terms of the company\u2019s most recent proxy statement.</p> <p>The data breach, which experts suggest could have been carried out by Russian, Chinese or North Korean sponsored hackers, could end up costing Yahoo more than the $4.8bn it sold itself to Verizon for. Research by the Ponemon Institute, a data and privacy research service, shows the average cost of remediating a data breach is $221 an incident, which would work out as far more than the sale price.</p> <p>\u201cYahoo may very well be facing an existential crisis,\u201d said Corey Williams of identity management software company Centrify. \u201cAlready besieged by business execution issues and enduring a fire sale to Verizon, this may be the straw that breaks the camel\u2019s back.\u201d</p> <p>Alex Holden, founder of Hold Security, which has been tracking the flow of Yahoo data on the dark web, said: \u201cThe stolen Yahoo data is critical because it not only leads to a single system but to users\u2019 connections to their banks, social media profiles, other financial services and users\u2019 friends and family. This is one of the biggest breaches of people\u2019s privacy and very far reaching.\u201d</p>",

It came at the end of an excruciating, and at times utterly surreal little passage of play, in which Yorkshire\u2019s Adam Lyth and Alex Lees delivered a few overs of particularly ugly declaration bowling. Lees still managed to take two wickets. When he took the first of them \u2013 Dawid Malan, for 116, out slapping a full toss straight to square leg \u2013 his celebrations consisted of an apologetic shrug to his team-mates. It was Lees\u2019 first wicket in professional cricket. Given the way the game is headed \u2013 Yorkshire are 38 for one as I type this, and Lees is 19 not out \u2013 it may not be the most memorable thing that happens to him today. Anyway. Middlesex\u2019s captain James Franklin was so determined to get the declaration spot on that he and Steve Eskinazi refused to hit a fair few of the pies Lees and Lyth were serving them. So we were treated to the strange spectacle of batsmen cautiously blocking rank bowling. Thankfully, that\u2019s all over now, though I guess it may be a while before Somerset and their supporters forgive, or forget, this strange episode.</p> <p>Oh, another wicket, Lees out for 20, and Yorkshire 39 for two.

Durham have fallen behind the rate but having lost just one wicket will be tempted to launch an effort after tea. Mason Crane, the talented young Hampshire leg-spinner, is doing his best to keep both sides in the match, alternating four-balls with wicket-taking deliveries. Stoneman, playing his last innings for Durham before joining Surrey (as is Borthwick) was almost caught at deep mid-off by James Vince off Crane when he had made 67, having almost fallen to the same combo a little earlier. At tea, Durham have scored 149 for one. That means they have to make 147 more off 27 overs. It might become a terrible anti-climax but I think Durham will have a go after they\u2019ve had a cuppa. I\u2019m keeping half an eye on Lord\u2019s too.

With the points, potentially, still to win the title themselves, they were scarcely in a position to do so, the more so when Sidebottom removed Sam Robson in his first over and Jack Brooks castled Nick Compton in his second. This being so, it became incumbent on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/middlesex\">Middlesex</a> to do all they could to ensure Yorkshire do not win (it is in the genes of the Middle Saxon) and by the close they had reached 81 for two from 38 overs, still 39 adrift, with Nick Gubbins on 38 and Dawid Malan 37.</p> <p>There does, though, remain an outside possibility that Middlesex could bat long enough to set Yorkshire a Twenty20-type run\u2011rate knowing they would have to go for it.

  "<p>Middlesex, the Middle Saxons, are the county champions. A day of high tension at Lord\u2019s ended with James Franklin\u2019s side beating a gallant Yorkshire team by 61 runs, with 28 balls to spare. Albeit with a contrived declaration, Franklin had set Yorkshire 240 to win in 40 overs, in the knowledge that they had no option but to pursue the target to the end and, if there was an agreement that they would do so come what may, having been given a chance, then it was not one on which they reneged.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/sep/23/middlesex-beat-yorkshire-win-county-cricket-championship-somerset\">Middlesex pip Yorkshire and Somerset to title after thrilling finale at Lord\u2019s</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It was Middlesex\u2019s first title since 1993 and the sun gleamed on the trophy as it was carried triumphantly round the ground. In winning Middlesex deprived Somerset of their first title and, if one can commiserate with Chris Rogers and his side, then that is the game. Heads can be held high in Taunton although the cider may have turned a little sour.</p> <p>The bare scores cannot in themselves convey the drama that unfolded at the end. Can any championship have finished in quite such a fashion as this? By the time Toby Roland-Jones bowled the last ball of his 12th over to Azeem Rafiq, six wickets were down and the game was already up for Yorkshire but they remained committed to the chase to the end. Rafiq swung, connected with a top edge, and John Simpson took the catch behind the wicket.</p> <p>In the following over Steven Finn re-arranged Steve Patterson\u2019s stumps and now Roland-Jones, at the start of his next over, was faced by Andy Hodd. The wicketkeeper swung, missed and over went his off stump.</p> <p>Middlesex now needed a single wicket and had 29 more deliveries with which to take it. Roland-Jones, striding in from the middle distance, needed only one of them. As the crowd roared, he speared the ball through the defence of Ryan Sidebottom and flattened his leg stump. The championship had been won with a hat-trick. The entire Middlesex team chased the bowler across the turf and piled on top of him in front of the Compton stand.</p> <p>History does not recount whether Walter Robins received the same treatment when Middlesex won in 1947. It may not have been the finest haul in Roland-Jones\u2019 career but it will be the most memorable: six for 54 gave him 10 wickets in the match.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2016/sep/23/heartbroken-somerset-county-championship-final-day-cricket\">Heartbroken Somerset still played their part in a thrilling final day | Vic Marks</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Once Somerset had <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/sep/22/somerset-nottinghamshire-county-championship-division-one-day-three-match-report\">secured their victory at Taunton on Thursday</a>, and after three Lord\u2019s days of glorious scrapping and battling and heroics with bat and ball, the destiny of the county championship came down to an old-fashioned Sunday league flog. One half expected to see 12-yard run-ups (eat your heart out Roland-Jones), eight overs per bowler,and young girls dishing out the fags. Perhaps the finale and the magnificent efforts of Nick Gubbins and Tim Bresnan in keeping their teams afloat, did not deserve the half-hour of declaration bowling from Yorkshire that handed Middlesex 100 runs from eight overs. Maybe it was a little indecorous for the grand old lady that is Lord\u2019s, as if granny had been at the cooking sherry, hitched up her skirts and danced a can-can in front of the pavilion.</p> <p>Franklin might have taken the view that, with Yorkshire needing to win the match or finish third, he could have set, say, 200 in 20 overs. And if there are those who think that this would not be achievable with the lack of fielding restrictions and so forth, they need only look back three years where Durham chased 183 in a little over 20 overs to beat Nottinghamshire, Graeme Swann included. Franklin\u2019s judgment proved exquisite.</p> <p>It was certainly necessary, though, to persuade Yorkshire not just to do the running but at full throttle, in order to buy wickets rather than earn them. While Somerset, shrewdly, made a decision to prepare home pitches that would help their spinners (who utilised them brilliantly), Middlesex have no control over their own home surfaces. Lord\u2019s pitches are habitually bland \u2013 magnolia, one online commenter called them on Friday morning \u2013 which offer nothing to bowlers and even a quality bowling attack such as Middlesex\u2019s has struggled to close down games. There could be some blame to place on the drainage, which sucks moisture. Elsewhere dry pitches crumble and turn but not at Lord\u2019s. For the good of the game, international cricket included, MCC, Middlesex\u2019s landlords of course, needs to address the actual soil structure of the pitches. Four-day matches should not require contrivance.</p> <p>Yorkshire gave it a go but in truth,with a bowler-heavy team, they lacked the firepower for what was in effect white-ball cricket in red-ball clothing. Neither opener was able to clamber in to the new ball, with Adam Lyth caught at slip and, with the heave-ho already on, Alex Lees taken at deep midwicket. The promotion of David Willey, potentially destructive, brought few dividends and Stevie Eskinazi took a fine running catch at deep wide mid-on. Instead the heroics came from Bresnan once more. He and Gary Ballance added 50 in 10 overs before Sam Robson took another skier to remove Ballance, but Bresnan flogged four fours and two sixes in making 55 from 48 balls, before Roland-Jones caught him on the crease. He trudged off, taking with him Yorkshire\u2019s hopes, but no fellow can have done more for the cause than he had in the match.</p> <p>When play began, Middlesex, at 81 for two, were still behind in the game, 39 runs adrift of Yorkshire and, far from thinking about target-setting, needed first to extricate themselves. That they managed to do this was down to the two left-handers Gubbins and Dawid Malan, both unbeaten overnight, who played with considerable panache at times, driving beautifully. The score was two for two when they came together but they added 198 for the third wicket until five minutes before lunch when Gubbins, three short of a second hundred in the match, chipped a gentle return catch to the off-spinner Rafiq. Malan had himself reached 99 by the interval, his hundred coming immediately after, from 203 deliveries. Having survived the new ball, Malan fell to the filth, pumping a slow full toss from Lees to square-leg. Eskinazi, who gorged on the freebies, may not want to dine out on his unbeaten 78.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2016/sep/23/ryan-sidebottom-good-health-county-cricket-yorkshire\">Ryan Sidebottom chuntering away signals good health for county cricket | Barney Ronay</a> </p> </aside>",

The national cycling charity Sustrans was set up to establish a cycling network for Britain. Although great progress has been made, the routes opened are entirely aimed at leisure cycling \u2013 not the utilitarian business of linking A with B. Those who want to use bikes simply as transport are largely still forced on to the highway \u2013 almost always shared with heavy traffic. Providing a true national cycling network for routine travel is a vital but completely neglected task.<br><strong>Paul Cairns</strong><br><em>Halifax</em></p> <p>\u2022 You don\u2019t need to look as far as Helsinki or Hamburg to find an example of a city that is addressing the issue of over-dependence on cars.

This hasn\u2019t happened by chance \u2013 it is a direct result of years of progressive transport policies, including introducing a workplace parking levy in 2012 to pay for many of the improvements that give people a decent alternative to the car for travelling into and around the city.<br><strong>Cllr Nick McDonald</strong><br><em>Portfolio holder for business, growth and transport, Nottingham city council</em></p> <p>\u2022 Here along Europe\u2019s busiest bus route, the Oxford Road/Wilmslow Road corridor through south Manchester, some progress in challenging the hegemony of the car has been achieved: we now have our segregated cycle superhighway and nearby a new Metrolink tram route along an old railway line.</p> <p>Unfortunately such advances will be seriously undermined if the Christie hospital is allowed to build even more multistorey car parks in Withington, thereby encouraging their thousands of staff to commute by car and adding to high levels of air pollution and other health risks.

Cars&#xa0;produce 53% of this total, HGVs 21%. Buses and coaches are responsible for only 3.4% and rail, both passenger and freight, for a mere 3.2%.</p> <p>The majority of the population, 60%, have no car. Many suburban areas of large towns and cities and smaller towns have no or little public transport after 6pm and on Sundays. In rural areas, there is even less public transport. For those without a car, this can mean no practicable means of taking a job that requires shift or Sunday work, or of pursuing further qualifications and training.</p> <p>Public transport is essential for us all and should be given the priority in financial resources it deserves.<br><strong>Margherita Rendel</strong><br><em>London</em></p> <p>\u2022 Rural areas need cars, inner cities already do not, but outer city suburbs must plan them out by offering better alternatives. Unfortunately, many suburbs have good radial trains and buses, but terrible orbital ones, and pro-car local authorities still rule in parts of outer London. Barnet council predicts 29,000 extra cars a day around its Brent Cross shopping centre scheme. It&#xa0;refuses to redirect \u00a3200m-plus of planning gain money into something more sensible than extra roads \u2013 like starting a north London tram system.<br><strong>John Cox</strong><br><em>London</em></p> <p>\u2022 The reason for our choked roads is more complex than simply more cars. In&#xa0;real terms, car driving is now cheaper, so we make longer journeys. And we insist on travelling at the same time. He might like to check his roads at 3am. Over a week even the most congested road is running at less than 50% capacity.</p> <p>Organising people into buses is easier said than done: once people have cars, no one anywhere in the world has found the magic formula to get them on to buses. And making only electric cars is a utopian ideal: the materials for batteries and fuel cells are scarce.</p> <p>That leaves bikes. There are plenty of EU countries where bike use has increased from UK levels (2% of journeys) to more than public transport use (9% in the UK). The trick is easy. Direct and safe bike routes, and local councils setting an example by removing parking for officers and members.

To become MP for Witney, he would have to overturn Cameron\u2019s 22,700-vote majority in a seat where the last Green candidate won just 5.1% of the vote. </p> <p>But as Sanders points out, he has branding on his side. \u201cBecause of Bernard, I\u2019ve become famous, and I will get more attention from the media, and that\u2019s to be used to get the Green party\u2019s policies across,\u201d he told the Guardian.</p> <p>Sanders has lived in Oxford since 1968, having moved to Britain after falling in love with \u201ca beautiful Englishwoman\u201d, Margaret, to whom he was married until she died in 1983. </p> <p>He studied social work at Oxford University and worked as a social worker and adviser to people with disabilities and their carers. He also has a law degree from Harvard. </p> <p>Sanders has been the Green party\u2019s health spokesman since last year, and says the NHS and social care are the issues \u201cclosest to my heart\u201d. On a local level, he has campaigned in support of Witney and Horton hospitals, but also wants to highlight the pressure that social care is under nationally, and opposes the privatisation of social care and the NHS.</p> <p>He will also echo his brother\u2019s campaign\u2019s emphasis on social inequality. \u201cIn Britain, as in the US, we have had an increase in inequality in the last 30 years, and that\u2019s having all sorts of consequences,\u201d he said. \u201cMany people can\u2019t afford houses who you would have expected to not long ago.\u201d </p> <p>Neoliberalism, he says, has \u201cshuddered to a close\u201d, and he blames resentment for that for the Brexit vote.</p> <p>The same tides in the US are what propelled his brother\u2019s campaign, he said. \u201cBernard\u2019s campaign in America was a very successful shifting point.\u201d</p> <p>Sanders will face barrister Robert Courts as the Conservative candidate, local councillor Liz Leffman for the Liberal Democrats, and Duncan Enright as the Labour candidate. </p> <p>The Greens point out that Enright has called for Corbyn to stand down, creating the scope for Sanders to pick up support among Corbyn-backing voters. Caroline Lucas, the party\u2019s MP and co-leader, will campaign in the constituency on Saturday.</p> <p>Larry Sanders campaigned for his brother as a member of Democrats Abroad and was filmed telling the Democratic convention through tears that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/jul/26/bernie-sanders-brother-larry-democratic-convention-video\">their parents would be \u201cimmensely proud\u201d</a>.</p> <p>Bernie Sanders will not be officially endorsing Larry, because of the convention against foreign politicians intervening in domestic elections. </p> <p>But in last year\u2019s general election, when Larry Sanders ran for the Greens in the neighbouring constituency of Oxford West and Abingdon, Bernie spoke via Skype at a meeting of Larry\u2019s supporters. Larry Sanders will not rule out a similar intervention in the byelection. </p> <p>\u201cOur similarities in terms of policies are astonishing, partly because we talk all the time,\u201d Larry Sanders said. <br></p> <p>He cannot think of a policy where they have major differences, he added. \u201cWe both have maintained a kind of naivet\u00e9, where we look around and say, why does a rich country have poor people?\u201d</p>",
  "<p>\u201cOh, of course I\u2019m obsessed,\u201d says Robert Lahr with a wide grin. \u201cIt\u2019s an addiction, clearly it is.

Half of those aged 18 to 24 have actively considered getting one. </p> <p>Earlier this week, Acas, the conciliation service, <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-37419897\">said negative attitudes were outdated</a> and employers risked missing out on the best staff if they discriminated against those with conspicuous inkings. </p> <p>And yet, such attitudes have not gone away.

  "<p>Harriet Harman is to launch a blistering attack on Theresa May, claiming that while she may be Britain\u2019s second female prime minister, \u201cshe\u2019s no sister\u201d when it comes to women\u2019s rights.</p> <p>In a speech on Saturday, the senior Labour politician will claim the Conservative leader is a \u201cdrag anchor\u201d on efforts to push forward women\u2019s rights for describing them as a burden on business and voting against the Equality Act.</p> <p>But Harman, who has been at the forefront of Britain\u2019s feminist movement for decades, will also warn that it is \u201craining men\u201d at the top of the Labour party, which is embarrassing while the Tory party, the SNP, Greens and even Ukip have female leaders.</p> <p>Speaking at her party\u2019s women\u2019s conference on Saturday, Harman will argue that even at the height of Labour divisions three decades ago, when hard left groups were kicked out of the party, female politicians stuck together.</p> <p>\u201cIn the 1980s, despite the turmoil in the party with the party split from top to bottom and with predictions we would never govern again, we women across all of the party worked together and made massive progress,\u201d she will say.<br></p> <p>\u201cWe worked together as women in the cause of women despite our differences over the leadership at that time. And so we must and will now.\u201d</p> <p>Speaking to the Guardian, Harman put the continued relationships between the women on the left and right of the party down to \u201csisterly solidarity\u201d that meant unity around the gender equality agenda trumped disagreements about Labour\u2019s direction.</p> <p>Harman, who has been critical of Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s leadership, will be making the comments while introducing Angela Rayner, the shadow education and women\u2019s minister, who is a close ally of the party leader. </p> <p>Harman will describe her colleague as \u201cgrounded in the real world and a voice of clarity and principle\u201d and deserving of the full backing of all of Labour\u2019s female MPs.</p> <p>Addressing an audience that will include Jess Phillips, the MP who chairs the women\u2019s parliamentary Labour party, as well as Diane Abbott, the shadow health secretary, Harman will say that with 100 female MPs, Labour remains the party of and for women and for equality.</p> <p>But she will add: \u201cLet\u2019s face it, there\u2019s not one of us here who isn\u2019t smarting that while the Tories, SNP, the Greens and even, God help us, Ukip have a woman leader, when it comes to Labour it\u2019s raining men.\u201d<br></p> <p>Asked whether she thought the responsibility to change the male-dominated leadership team in the Labour party lay with Corbyn, Harman said the issue was a deeper \u201csystemic\u201d problem that predated the current leadership.</p> <p>She said Labour had learned the lesson that not being able to attract women\u2019s votes during the 1980s had locked them out of power, so they opted for wholesale changes such as all-women shortlists.</p> <p>\u201cWe went for broke in nailing this problem of women voters thinking we were a male-dominated party and we got an avalanche of women\u2019s votes,\u201d Harman said, pointing to Labour\u2019s 44% lead with women aged 25 to 34 in 2000.</p> <p>But she said that once Labour cracked the female vote, then \u201ccomplacency grew up, men were happy to have women\u2019s votes, but not happy to share power\u201d, resulting in a glass ceiling within the party.</p> <p>\u201cWe made all the changes that flagged up to women that we would be there for them, but then things slipped back. Although women were there, men fought for and got control,\u201d she said, arguing that in the struggle for power women had been squeezed out of top positions.</p> <p>The need to tackle that issue but also not allow Labour\u2019s woes to divide women is urgent, Harman will say, because of the new government.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ve got a new Tory prime minister \u2013 and she\u2019s a woman. But like Margaret Thatcher before her, Theresa May is no supporter of women,\u201d she will say.</p> <p>\u201cWhen we were pushing for more Labour women MPs, she chased me round TV and radio studios decrying us, joining the men in her party and some in ours who called it \u2018political correctness gone mad\u2019.</p> <p>\u201cAnd while she\u2019s been in government, she\u2019s voted every time for the cuts to the vital programmes that we brought in when we were in government, like Sure Start centres, and for tax credits for childcare. Theresa May is woman - but she\u2019s no sister.\u201d</p> <p>A Downing Street source said: \u201cIt\u2019s frankly pathetic to see a politician from a party that has never elected a female leader and whose female MPs routinely receive abuse for taking a stance in a leadership election belittling the successes of Britain\u2019s second female prime minister.</p> <p>\u201cWhile Theresa May is getting on with building a country that works for everyone, Harriet Harman and the Labour party are too divided to deliver anything for women in Britain.\u201d</p>",

When the coalition government came to power in 2010, it revised <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/jun/29/cameron-backing-theresa-may-counter-extremism-strategy-fundamental-shift\" title=\"\">the Prevent strategy</a> to define extremism as \u201cvocal or active opposition to fundamental British values\u201d including democracy, the rule of law, individual liberty and tolerance of different faiths and beliefs.</p> <p>This change in policy was partly a reaction against some of the counter-terrorism work done by the previous Labour government in conjunction with Muslim faith groups. Critics claimed some of the faith groups that had been selected actually contributed to underlying problems of intolerance and division, because they reinforced the idea of separation between Muslim and other British communities. Moreover the new definition of nonviolent extremism was intended to be wider than Islamist groups, and to include the far right.</p> <p>The definition, however, is not based on any clear theoretical or practical link to violence. Clearly, \u201cnonviolent extremists\u201d don\u2019t have to be in favour of violence. The latest counter-extremism strategy, from 2015, states that extremist ideology is the core problem, with terrorism merely a symptom. By contrast, the research on terrorism, radicalisation and extremism suggests that, though beliefs matter to people and organisations who adopt violence, a more complex mix of social, psychological, political and strategic factors plays a part.</p> <p>The idea of \u201cnon-violent extremism\u201d has critics ranging from academics defending freedom of thought \u2013 such as <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/oxford-university-vice-chancellor-says-prevent-strategy-wrong-headed-a7323916.html\" title=\"\">Oxford University\u2019s vice-chancellor</a> this week \u2013 to police officers questioning how this concept could realistically be controlled.</p> <p>But much less attention has been paid&#xa0;to the fact that Britain is also exporting its definition. Few people have analysed the implications for foreign policy of the UK promoting this concept of \u201cnon-violent extremism\u201d among its global allies, through training programmes as well as high-level security dialogues. The concept hasn\u2019t caught on with most western democracies, which remain focused on countering violent extremism; but it has been warmly received by non-democratic states, including some in the Gulf, which favour the sort of broad definitions that tar nonviolent dissidents with the same brush as violent ones.</p> <p>Paradoxically, the UK\u2019s definition of extremism is intended to reinforce liberal democratic values. But this is lost in translation when non-democracies embrace it. They are not amending their definitions to promote liberal values: rather, they tend to see Britain\u2019s approach as validating their view that it is legitimate to criminalise dissident beliefs as a threat to national security.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/aug/31/combat-terror-end-support-saudi-arabia-dictatorships-fundamentalism\">To really combat terror, end support for Saudi Arabia | Owen Jones</a> </p> </aside>  <p>When it comes to counter-terrorism cooperation with the Middle East, there is a clear common interest in fighting a recognised, common threat such as Isis or al-Qaida.

By contrast, the UAE has made it illegal to declare other Muslims to be apostates, as it sees this \u201ctakfirism\u201d as deeply interlinked with extremists.</p> <p>The UK, keen to strengthen its counter-terrorism partnerships, seems content to gloss over these differences. But if we don\u2019t deal with the consequences of our loose definitions, including human rights abuses and the stoking of popular discontent in response, we could be storing up problems that come back to haunt us.</p>",
  "<p>Older Americans are more likely to vote and, when they do, they vote Republican. That\u2019s how the conventional wisdom goes, anyway.

In 2008 it was 21 percentage points, and in 2004 it was just 9 percentage points. In other words, though this trend has long existed, the size of it depends on other factors too \u2013 factors like which candidates are standing for election.</p> <p><a href=\"http://graphics.latimes.com/usc-presidential-poll-dashboard/\">Polling</a> so far suggests that the 2016 candidates\u2019 popularity (or <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/may/04/donald-trump-hillary-clinton-general-election-analysis\">lack thereof</a>) isn\u2019t a huge surprise in terms of these age trends. Voters age 65 and over are the group most likely to vote for Republican nominee Donald Trump; those age 18 to 34 are the least likely to vote for him.</p> <p>Don\u2019t forget though, correlation doesn\u2019t mean causality \u2013 the reasons why older voters lean Republican isn\u2019t necessarily their age per se. Older Americans are more likely to be white and they\u2019re also more likely to be religious (Protestant or Catholic in particular) \u2013 and both of those demographic groups also tend to vote Republican for reasons that are quite separate from pension plans.</p> <p>It\u2019s also a mistake to treat such a loose group as \u201cthe oldest voters\u201d as a single unit. Research from <a href=\"http://www.people-press.org/2015/09/03/the-whys-and-hows-of-generations-research/\">Pew Research Center</a> has found that baby boomers (those age 50 to 68) are less likely to identify with the label Republican than the uncomfortably titled silent generation (who are age 69 to 86).</p> <p>As for turnout, that is sometimes even harder to correctly forecast than voting intention. Will young Democrats who were galvanized by Hillary Clinton\u2019s former Democratic rival Bernie Sanders choose to stay at home now he\u2019s out of the race, making the older voting bloc even more powerful? Will older, more traditional Republicans be put off by Donald Trump\u2019s political style? Both questions demonstrate just how much it\u2019s the youngest and the oldest voters that will be crucial in determining the results of the 2016 election. </p>",

In the late 00s, operators of the San Francisco Bay Area\u2019s Cow Palace tried harm reduction and <a href=\"http://www.laweekly.com/news/death-money-and-megaraves-2168455\">found no improvement</a>, with multiple hospitalizations.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/shortcuts/2013/jul/22/pma-not-another-drug-scare-story\">PMA: 'not just another drug scare story'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>We\u2019re fairly liberal in California. Marijuana is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/may/04/california-marijuana-election-2016\">on the ballot this November</a> and is likely to be fully legalized after 20 years of pioneering medical legitimacy. The so-called godfather of ecstasy, Sasha Shulgin, was a lifelong resident. We\u2019re not opposed to fun. The important thing to acknowledge is that MDMA has a deadly record, like alcohol, heroin and cocaine. There are only two sure solutions when it comes to saving ravers\u2019 lives: one, don\u2019t hold raves. That\u2019s not going to happen, and we don\u2019t want it to. Two, make them 21 and older. </p> <p>None of the 25 deaths happened at 21-and-older events. Last year, following the 2015 deaths, Hard Day of the Dead went 21-plus. Nobody died. Of course, the crowds, estimated at 20,000, were fractional. Hard Summer saw about 147,000 people through the turnstiles this year. Yes, some of the deceased over the years have been older than 21, but barely. When 20-year-old Kenani Kaimuloa died after attending EDC Vegas this year, her father, an Iraq combat veteran, told a local newspaper reporter that he had been waiting for her to come home that weekend \u201cto give me her Father\u2019s Day present\u201d. If 21-and-older works, then, why isn\u2019t it done more often?</p>",

By contrast, Mary Berry has merely sacrificed power for principles. So much for the kinder baking.</p> <p>The best way forward would be for the New Great British Bake-Off to create a politically-balanced kitchen cabinet; which will allow them to give cooks their just desserts. <br />An enabling kitchen - where people are encouraged to take responsibility for half-baked recipes; and which harnesses the power of the supermarket. </p> <p>Nowhere is this more important than when it comes to the craft of biscuithood. With the right ingredients, even the most homely of cooks will be able to create a good, centrist biscuit - such as the custard cream, for instance; or perhaps a more aspirational variety - like the aptly named Boaster. <br /> <br />I feel that there is little more which remains to be said on this most contentious matter, quite frankly.

Following a Tony Benn dictum, Jeremy Corbyn used to demand a leadership ballot every year \u2013 and now he may get it. The party is so deeply and permanently divided, I see no way the two sides can come together until some other leader emerges more or less acceptable to both. If Owen Smith manages to get over 40% it will count as a success for non-Corbynites, but it will show how far the name \u201cLabour\u201d houses two quite different parties now. Many members warn they will quit, but democracy always rights itself in the end. Some day, goodness knows when, the Conservatives will over-reach and fall.

The Labour party is in a much more uncertain position: seemingly largely united as far as its newly inflated membership is concerned, but also troubled further towards the top. Some MPs are taking minders with them to the party conference. The party\u2019s national executive thinks online abuse is such a toxic issue that it will now require members to sign up to a new code of conduct. There are voices on all sides of the party talking about \u201cunity and taking the fight to the Tories\u201d (it\u2019s a cliche already), but the chances of all those MPs dutifully settling down and accepting Corbyn\u2019s pre-eminence seem slim. Meanwhile, some voices \u2013 witness this parish\u2019s Paul Mason \u2013 are calling for the most intransigent parliamentary anti-Corbynites to be replaced: \u201cdeselected\u201d, as the Labour vernacular would have it.</p> <p> I\u2019m curious to know: do people think JC and his people now have to complete their dominance of the party, or do they prefer the idea of a concerted attempt at some kind of detente? Do they even think that\u2019s even possible? And also, is it time we all got our heads straight and acknowledged that Labour/the left is faced with a much longer haul than anything beginning with a win in 2020?

  "<p>This week, Mark Zuckerberg and his wife Dr Priscilla Chan pledged $3bn to \u201c<a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/sep/21/mark-zuckerberg-priscilla-chan-end-disease\">cure, manage and prevent all diseases</a>\u201d by the end of the century. While $3bn sounds like a lot of money, the US National Institutes of Health (NIH) spends <a href=\"http://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/here-s-reality-check-mark-zuckerberg-s-3b-plan-end-n652301\">more than 10 times as much</a> on biomedical research per year. Since 2003, the US has spent <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://kff.org/global-health-policy/fact-sheet/the-u-s-presidents-emergency-plan-for/\">more than 20 times as much</a> through the President\u2019s Emergency Plan for Aids Relief to end HIV/Aids worldwide. Bill Gates, whose foundation has donated <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.gatesfoundation.org/What-We-Do/Global-Health/HIV\">well over $3bn</a> to the fight against HIV alone, recently acknowledged that despite all that\u2019s been done to date, \u201c<a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.gatesnotes.com/Health/Turning-the-Corner-on-AIDS\">we have not turned the corner on Aids</a>\u201d. It seems like tremendous hubris for Chan and Zuckerberg to set such a lofty goal.</p> <p>Zuckerberg made his first major foray into philanthropy in 2010, when he gave <a href=\"http://www.oprah.com/oprahshow/Mark-Zuckerbergs-Big-Announcement-Video\">$100m</a> to help reform failing schools in Newark, NJ, hoping this would become a model for the nation. But because he didn\u2019t understand the challenges posed by the regulatory environment and culture of the city\u2019s public schools, his gift as well as an additional $100m in matching funds didn\u2019t have the desired <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.npr.org/2015/09/21/442183080/assessing-the-100-million-upheaval-of-newarks-public-schools\">impact</a>. But Zuckerberg says he\u2019s learned from some of his initial mistakes. More recently, he invested another <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/answer-sheet/wp/2014/05/30/mark-zuckerberg-is-giving-120-million-to-bay-area-schools-after-his-last-education-reform-effort-didnt-go-so-well/\">$120m</a> in schools in his own backyard where he\u2019s better able to engage with the community and understand the urban education crisis.</p> <p>I hope Zuckerberg and Chan have learned from their Newark experience, because it\u2019s precisely by changing the culture of biomedical research that they could make good on their pledge.</p> <p>Success rates for NIH grant applications are at the <a href=\"https://report.nih.gov/displayreport.aspx?rid=665\">lowest</a> they\u2019ve been going as far back as the 1970s. When the money for science is this tight, <a href=\"http://nautil.us/issue/37/currents/why-is-biomedical-research-so-conservative\">researchers don\u2019t take big risks</a>. Instead of making innovative leaps in science, researchers early in their careers are typically among the most risk averse, taking on bits of studies designed by their senior mentors. Writing a successful grant application often requires preliminary data \u2013 in other words, you need to have already done a chunk of the research you\u2019re proposing to do. Even then, about 20-25% of academic biomedical researchers\u2019 time (in my experience) is spent applying for grants to support their projects. Much of their mental effort goes into <a href=\"http://postdoc.hms.harvard.edu/slides/Part3_strategies_for_success_Coelho.pdf\">grantsmanship</a>, which is not at all the same thing as creativity.</p> <p>Academic researchers are promoted on the basis of \u201cachievement\u201d \u2013 grants won and papers published. Volume is what matters here, not necessarily impact. According to <a href=\"https://www.ted.com/talks/adam_grant_the_surprising_habits_of_original_thinkers?language=en\">Adam Grant</a>, a professor of organizational psychology at the Wharton School of Business, \u201cThe greatest originals are the ones who fail the most, because they\u2019re the ones who try the most.\u201d But biomedical researchers can\u2019t afford to have failed experiments because they\u2019re not publishable. Furthermore, they need to take as much of the credit as possible for that \u201cproductivity\u201d to count towards their advancement, so there\u2019s an incentive against working with too many other people. Biomedical research is highly siloed in parallel with the grants funding it. An added challenge is that the gold standard for medical research \u2013 the randomized clinical trial, ideally conducted in multiple sites and settings \u2013 is very expensive.</p> <p>With their $3bn commitment, Chan and Zuckerberg could bring about a cross-cutting revolution in the tools used to conduct biomedical research. Of this funding $600m will support the <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.ucsf.edu/news/2016/09/404286/joe-derisi-how-biohub-will-create-opportunities-research-collaboration\">Chan Zuckerberg Biohub</a> in San Francisco, which will encourage collaboration among biomedical researchers, computer scientists and engineers at UCSF, UC Berkeley and Stanford University.</p> <p>The Biohub\u2019s initial projects will include the Cell Atlas Initiative to map all the many types of cells that make up the human body \u2013 a task similar in some ways to the <a href=\"https://www.genome.gov/12011238/an-overview-of-the-human-genome-project/\">Human Genome Project</a>, but exponentially more complicated. The Biohub will also launch an Infectious Disease Initiative to develop new diagnostic tests, drugs and vaccines for infectious diseases including HIV, Ebola and Zika. Both initiatives will be test cases for Zuckerberg\u2019s theory that together biomedical researchers, computer scientists and engineers can develop new tools to automate and accelerate biomedical research, ideally also driving down costs and reducing the risk of conducting such research.</p> <p>According to <a href=\"http://profiles.ucsf.edu/joe.derisi\">Dr Joe DeRisi</a>, who will co-direct the Biohub, they are \u201choping to attract investigators who have bold new ideas that normal grant-giving organizations might not have an appetite for, because the ideas may be at too exploratory a stage\u201d. But it remains unclear how they plan to do this, especially when you consider that the current system selects for more conservative scientists. I worry that too many scientific originals will be weeded out by the system before they can hope to get funding from the likes of Chan and Zuckerberg.</p>",
  "<p>A global wildlife summit opening on Saturday is a \u201cdo or die\u201d moment for endangered animals around the world, say conservationists, from iconic species such as elephants and lions to lesser known, but equally troubled, creatures such as devil rays and the psychedelic rock gecko.</p> <p>The summit in Johannesburg brings together 181 nations to crack down on wildlife trafficking, currently a $20bn-a-year criminal enterprise, and to ensure the legal trade in food, skins, pets and traditional remedies does not threaten the survival of species. The member nations of the <a href=\"https://cites.org/eng\">Convention on the International Trade in Endangered Species</a> (Cites) will vote on proposals to toughen or loosen trade bans and regulations for over 500 species.</p> <p>A total trade ban is being <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/jul/29/pangolins-being-eaten-to-extinction-conservationists-warn-anteaters\">sought for pangolins</a>, an exotic scaled creature, which is now the world\u2019s most trafficked mammal, while more protection for sharks, parrots and frogs are also on the table. The most controversial proposals are for elephants: some southern African nations want to overturn the ban on selling ivory while a rival proposal from 29 other African countries aims to make protections even tougher.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/gallery/2015/mar/16/pangolins-worlds-most-illegally-traded-mammal-in-pictures\">Pangolins: the world's most illegally traded mammal \u2013 in pictures</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cWith so many of our wild animal and plant species facing serious threats from rapacious poaching and commercial trade, this Cites meeting represents a \u2018do or die\u2019 moment,\u201d said Teresa Telecky, wildlife director of the Humane Society International. \u201cEither countries do the right thing and give these imperilled species the highest level of protection possible against unsustainable exploitation, or we risk seeing them die out altogether in the wild.\u201d</p> <p>The proposals are based on scientific evidence, but national political agendas loom large too. \u201cThe stakes are high for so many species and we must make certain that sound science and the precautionary principle are deciding factors and not short-term political or economic interests,\u201d said Azzedine Downes, president of the International Fund for Animal Welfare (IFAW).</p> <p>Others are concerned that high-profile rows over the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/sep/11/ivory-trade-international-agreement\">elephant</a> proposals, which could all fail to pass, will distract from work on enforcement to end the scourge of poaching. Over 140,000 of Africa\u2019s savannah elephants were <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/aug/12/elephants-on-the-path-to-extinction-the-facts\">killed for their ivory</a> between 2007 and 2014, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/aug/31/poaching-drives-huge-30-decline-in-africas-savannah-elephants\">wiping out almost a third of their population</a>. Elephants are still being killed every 15 minutes on average. </p> <p>Nations where poaching, trafficking or illegal sales take place should have submitted action plans but Cameroon, Ethiopia, Gabon and Nigeria have not, and could face sanctions on all their wildlife-related trade. </p> <p>\u201cWe are concerned that the summit is likely to be a rerun of the old pattern, with proposals and counter-proposals on legal international ivory trade diverting attention from the real issues,\u201d said WWF in statement. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/apr/28/swaziland-unveils-plan-to-legalise-rhino-horn-to-pay-for-anti-poaching-efforts\">Swaziland has also proposed to legalise the sale of horn from rhino</a>, whose populations have plummeted, but will face fierce opposition.</p> <p>The species being evaluated for protection at Cites span the land, ocean and skies. African lions ought to get the strongest protection, according to scientists at the Zoological Society of London (ZSL) while Jan Creamer, president of Animal Defenders International, said the big cat\u2019s survival was at stake: \u201cIt is clear that we are at risk of being the generation that allowed a magnificent species to disappear from the wild.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.ifaw.org/united-states/our-work/wildlife-trade/protecting-pangolin\">Pangolins</a>, whose scales are sold in China and Vietnam as a supposed medicine, could also get stronger protection. More than a million have been taken from the wild in the past decade, according to WildAid, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/gallery/2015/mar/16/pangolins-worlds-most-illegally-traded-mammal-in-pictures\">decimating Asian populations</a>. As a result, poaching has also ramped up in Africa and in June over 11 tonnes of pangolin scales were seized in Hong Kong in just two shipments from Africa. \u201cWe could very soon see this amazing species disappear, if the unsustainable trade continues,\u201d says Mark Hofberg, IFAW\u2019s pangolin expert. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"46fdfef6f7303a00edaf8bb462101447c058a3ab\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/46fdfef6f7303a00edaf8bb462101447c058a3ab/0_147_5048_3029/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Silky shark populations have been hit by the fishing trade.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Silky shark populations have been hit by the fishing trade.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Georgette Douwma/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In the seas, stricter protection is on the table for silky and thresher sharks, both heavily hit by the fin trade, and for devil rays, whose gills are sold in China. \u201cDevil rays grow very slowly and produce just one pup about every two years, making them intrinsically susceptible to overfishing,\u201d said Sebasti\u00e1n Pardo, at Simon Fraser University in Canada.</p> <p>The nautilus could also get its first trade protections, as it is being overfished for its beautiful shells which are used for jewellery and ornaments. Many turtle species are eaten in Asia and have suffered heavily as a result, and flapshell and softshell turtle proposals will be voted on during the two-week summit.</p> <p>In the air, African grey parrots, which are extraordinary vocal mimics, may get the highest level of protection. Scientists estimate that two to three million African greys were captured from the wild between 1975 and 2013, and despite successful captive breeding, populations have decreased by between 50% and 90% and in some places they are locally extinct.</p> <p>There are many proposals for better protection for reptiles and amphibians. \u201cA lot of lizards and frogs are traded illegally,\u201d said John Scanlon, secretary general of Cites. \u201cThey are being taken primarily for the illegal pet trade, and primarily to Europe. We need to get this under control, as these animals are also a critical part of the ecosystem.\u201d </p> <p>The psychedelic rock gecko, found only in Vietnam, is in line for better protection along with others including the Hong Kong warty newt and both the tomato frog and the false tomato frog.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/nov/11/lizard-traffickers-exploit-legal-loopholes-to-trade-at-worlds-biggest-fair\">Lizard traffickers exploit legal loopholes to trade at world's biggest fair</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Cites, which began in 1975, is increasingly regulating the timber trade too and could introduce protection for the entire genus of rosewood species.

With Asian rosewood numbers crashing, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/feb/16/rosewood-madagascar-china-illegal-rainforest\">focus of loggers has increasingly moved to Africa</a> and central America, where they \u201ccapitalise on unstable situations in fragile states, moving swiftly from country to country creating devastating \u2018boom-and-bust cycles\u2019,\u201d according the Forest Trends group.</p> <p>A minority of the Cites proposals are to loosen restrictions on the international trade in species that have recovered from previously precarious positions. The total bans protecting the peregrine falcon and the Cape mountain zebra may be lifted.</p> <p>\u201cThe recovery of species like the peregrine falcon shows that Cites can work and that populations can bounce back thanks to trade bans and conservation efforts,\u201d said Ginette Hemley, head of WWF\u2019s delegation to Cites. \u201cIf the world takes decisive action in Johannesburg, we can look forward to more success stories in the future.\u201d</p> <p>Scanlon said: \u201cWe have made significant progress since the last Cites summit in 2013, politically, financially and technically.

Now it is shifting from the corridors of power to the street. Kabila thinks he may be able to tough it out. The opposition thinks it might provoke a crisis,\u201d said Jason Stearns, director of the Congo Research Group at New York University. </p> <p>Kabila took over as leader of the DRC less than two weeks after his father, Laurent, was shot by a bodyguard in the presidential palace in 2001. He was elected president in disputed polls in 2006 and again in 2011. The DRC\u2019s constitution bars a third term. </p> <p>Analysts say Kabila appears to have adopted a strategy of \u201c<em>glissement</em>\u201d, or indefinite delay. </p> <p>Western states, including the US, have repeatedly told Kabila to stick to the election calendar. Several \u2013 most notably the US \u2013 are now considering targeted sanctions against key senior individuals within his inner circle. However the opposition is fragmented, with some major figures overseas and others joining talks with the president\u2019s representatives.</p> <p>Juve\u0301nal Munubo, a parliamentarian with the opposition Union Pour La Nation Congolaise said that the coming weeks would see a surge in violence if Kabila did not clarify his position on leaving power and move to reduce tensions with political opponents by releasing political prisoners or dropping law cases against dissidents.</p> <p>Munubo called for a new date for the election to be fixed for next year as soon as possible. \u201cThe negotiations are the best way forward but must be inclusive and conclude rapidly,\u201d he said.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"2a312dfe0209f8056a24b99bb63f0c7e4fd78df7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2a312dfe0209f8056a24b99bb63f0c7e4fd78df7/0_0_2832_4256/665.jpg\" alt=\"A man walks past a statue with a graffiti reading \u2018Kabila get out\u2019 in Kinshasa.\" width=\"665\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A man walks past a statue with a graffiti reading \u2018Kabila get out\u2019 in Kinshasa.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Junior D.kannah/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The office of Kabila, who has been abroad during the unrest attending the United Nations general assembly in New York, issued its first statement on Wednesday condemning the violence and offering its condolences to victims\u2019 families.</p> <p>Kabila \u201cinvites the entire population to go about their daily activities now that security is again fully ensured,\u201d it said on state-owned television.</p> <p>Human rights groups say they have catalogued a wave of detentions, disappearances and attacks on opponents of the government.

The current version is thought to exclude about half of the DRC\u2019s 45 million potential voters, including about 7 million new voters who have come of age since 2011. Independent experts have said a complete revision could take 10-18 months.</p> <p>Whereas neighbouring strongmen Denis Sassou Nguesso in Congo-Brazzaville and Paul Kagame in Rwanda easily pushed through constitutional changes to allow them to stand for third terms, Kabila has been unable to take such a blunt approach.</p> <p>Kabila did manage to outmanoeuvre Mo\u00efse Katumbi, a tycoon who was seen as a powerful challenger. Katumbi, who had built a support base in Katanga province, was forced to leave the country earlier this year to seek medical treatment.</p> <p>Katumbi is currently in Washington, from where he issued a call for sanctions this week. \u201cWithout sanctions, they will continue killing people like mosquitoes,\u201d Katumbi said.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/gallery/2016/sep/23/political-violence-in-the-democratic-republic-of-the-congo-in-pictures\">Political violence in the Democratic Republic of the Congo \u2013 in pictures</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Congo has found itself the focus of a range of foreign actors in recent weeks.

  "<p>Derren Brown has written a book on happiness, so it seems reasonable to assume he is something of an expert. He says he is happy, and judging by the bibliography, he has definitely read a lot on the subject. But I\u2019m not sure the two of us agree on what happiness is. His book, Happy, advocates \u201ccontentment\u201d, \u201ctranquillity\u201d, a \u201cconsidered\u201d life. It all feels so unexciting.</p> <p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t sound very joyful, does it?\u201d Brown agrees. \u201cBut would you press the button for consistently joyful, which is clearly not real or a bit mad or exhausting, or would you press the button for a robust sense of calmness and balance?\u201d I think, in that situation, I would hunt around for a third button, the one marked \u201cfrequent spontaneous bursts of ecstasy\u201d \u2013 there is something listless about the thought of all that calmness \u2013 but Brown sees balance as \u201ca much more helpful aim. I think it\u2019s what we want.\u201d</p> <p>Brown, 45, speaks with a moderated calm, as if a kind of emotion-detector has filtered out the peaks and troughs of pitch. \u201cYeah,\u201d he giggles. \u201cI am a bit like that.\u201d He has what he calls \u201can avoidant personality\u201d, by which he means that he\u2019s \u201cvery good at avoiding anything that might feel stressful\u201d. Some people might think it would be stressful <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2003/oct/08/broadcasting.channel41\">to play Russian roulette</a>, as Brown appeared to do on TV in 2003, but he says that\u2019s \u201cjust the job. In real life, when I can avoid anything stressful, I do.\u201d</p> <p>Brown describes Happy as \u201ca philosophical, anti-self-help self-help book\u201d. To put it crudely, he decries the work of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/may/27/rhonda-byrne-the-secret-estate-montecito-sale\">Rhonda Byrne</a> \u2013 author of The Secret, which coaches readers to believe that positive thinking will deliver what they want \u2013 and aligns himself instead with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/nov/28/stoic-week-stiff-upper-lip\">Seneca and Stoicism</a>. \u201cIt is not events out there that cause our problems, but our reactions to them,\u201d Brown writes. He is not himself a Stoic. \u201cNot with a capital \u2018S\u2019\u201d anyway. But Stoicism \u201cwas something I was living as I was writing\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"77765c00bc3ae85cca23d08be66a299b48663856\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/77765c00bc3ae85cca23d08be66a299b48663856/157_3_2117_1270/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018That\u2019s just part of the job\u2019 \u2026 in one of Brown\u2019s television shows he appeared to play Russian roulette.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018That\u2019s just part of the job\u2019 \u2026 in one of Brown\u2019s television shows he appeared to play Russian roulette.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Youtube</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>He wrote Happy over three years, hauling a suitcase of philosophy books along with him on tour. Writing was therapeutic, not least because during that time he \u201cbroke up with a partner of eight years\u201d. He and Marc, a designer, remain friends. \u201cIt would have been easy for that to have slipped into a lot of anger with each other,\u201d Brown says. Instead, with the Stoics in his suitcase, and advice on how to apply them clattering on to his keyboard as he typed, he became aware \u201cthat so much of it is about the story that you tell yourself, being in the moment with it, and not trying to control things you can\u2019t control. I became very aware that the story I was telling other people about it was going to make a big difference to how I felt about it, and if I was going around looking for sympathy, saying \u2018This awful thing happened, this big tragedy \u2026 \u2019, then it would start to feel like that.\u201d</p> <p>So the next day, Brown texted Marc; it was Marc who had ended things. \u201cI said: \u2018It\u2019s silly that we\u2019re feeling terrible about this. What we\u2019re doing is a good thing. So we can feel fine about it.\u201d</p> <p>The next day? I ask, incredulous. After eight years, it took only 24 hours to make peace with his decision? \u201cYou must be pretty \u2026 \u201d</p> <p>\u201cCallous. Unemotional,\u201d he butts in with another giggle. His giggles are a bit like snickers; there is something of the schoolboy about him, his delicate features, his back-of-the-class quips. (When asked how he takes his coffee, he replies, \u201cOrally.\u201d)</p> <p>Not all his friends were convinced when he told them: \u201c\u2018It\u2019s a bit sad but it\u2019s fine.\u2019 I was getting the tilted-head thing. But actually \u2013 actually \u2013 those things are fine. I realised that whatever that relationship is, it will continue in some form. And how I behave will affect what it becomes in the future. So my priority became not to introduce anger.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6dbd839cd120e145b3fc0bbb1fc31a62369588a6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6dbd839cd120e145b3fc0bbb1fc31a62369588a6/13_27_1167_700/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018I do always look back and feel faintly embarrassed by anything I\u2019ve done in the past\u2019\u2026 Brown\u2019s 2003 publicity shot for Mind Games.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018I do always look back and feel faintly embarrassed by anything I\u2019ve done in the past\u2019\u2026 Brown\u2019s 2003 publicity shot for Mind Games.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Channel 4</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>And right there, just as the subtitle of the book says, more or less everything was absolutely fine. Brown has made a habit of appearing to disclose his magical methods while leaving the stupor of his audience intact, and I feel the same bafflement now. It is as if he took all his feelings about the breakup and \u2013 puff! \u2013 made them vanish. Or, at least, brought them under control, which perhaps amounts to the same. Just a different kind of magic.</p> <p>I don\u2019t see how any technique could provide so fast and thorough a salve to heartache. \u201cOh, with this breakup?\u201d he asks brightly. \u201cObviously, horrible night. That thing of waking up \u2026\u201d He draws a veil, a magician\u2019s handkerchief, over the rest of the sentence.</p> <p>Given that the hallmark of his stage and TV work is to extend his control and obfuscate its limits by blending magic with hypnosis and psychological manipulation, it is tempting to think that, in Happy, Brown is simply turning these powers on himself, making himself the object of his own suggestion. But he resists the idea that \u201cthere is an easy line to draw from my world of performing to the book\u201d. He will only concede that \u201cthey both come back to me\u201d.</p> <p>Certainly, Happy is a new direction. The bibliography runs to three pages. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/acgrayling\">AC Grayling</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/alaindebotton\">Alain de Botton</a> have provided enthusiastic quotes for the jacket. \u201cValidating!\u201d Brown grins. Despite his proclaimed fear of dinner parties, he has dined with both philosophers and found them \u201cdelightful\u201d. He can see Happy sitting \u201cvery comfortably\u201d in Waterstones\u2019 \u201cSmart Thinking\u201d section. And if it doesn\u2019t, well, he can always do what he did with <a href=\"https://www.penguin.co.uk/authors/derren-brown/1050179\">previous books</a> and move it.</p> <p>\u201cI used to do that a lot,\u201d he says: to his irritation, bookshops kept filing Confessions of a Conjuror under Games &amp; Puzzles. Given these habits, and the book\u2019s talk of taking control of the stories we tell about ourselves, I wonder if Happy is Brown\u2019s attempt to steer his own story along a more intellectual path. The word \u201cmagically\u201d crops up repeatedly and colloquially in the book \u2013 seeing partners \u201cin magical terms\u201d, and so on \u2013 as if Brown wants to divest the word of its professional meaning, so he can pass as a philosopher. After all, his next show is called <a href=\"http://derrenbrown.co.uk/no-tricks-an-evening-with-derren-brown\">No Tricks</a>, and really does contain no tricks, just Brown talking about happiness. Isn\u2019t the book an attempt to re-frame his own story in this light?</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2016/jan/13/derren-brown-pushed-to-the-edge-review\">Derren Brown: The Push \u2013 review: can a reasonable person be coerced to shove another to their death?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cWhat I mean by the story we tell ourselves, it\u2019s not so much having a broad \u2026 Maybe I do have a broad narrative. But it\u2019s not in the sense of \u2018I\u2019m this guy, and I\u2019m aiming here\u2019,\u201d he says. He has always claimed to lack ambition \u2013 to the extent that I\u2019m wondering if the insistence is itself part of his story. He has no specific aims for his private life, either. He has a new partner now, but marriage is \u201cone of those things that my avoidant personality very quickly shuns. Not avoid in the sense of \u2018I don\u2019t want to get married\u2019, but \u2018I don\u2019t want to think about that now\u2019.\u201d Children? \u201cAgain, no strong urge.\u201d He is having enough trouble with his puppy, Doodle.</p> <p>I can\u2019t help wondering what emotional vantage point Brown occupies in relation to his book \u2013 what great happiness or unhappiness he has known. Maybe his avoidant personality is at work again, because he says: \u201cI don\u2019t look back and find any time especially unhappy.\u201d When he was living in Bristol, for instance, after graduating in law and German, he lived on housing benefit with a pet parrot. He was just starting out in magic, and remembers thinking, \u201cWell, if I take a cross-section of my life at the moment, is everything as I\u2019d like it to be? And it was. Everything felt fine and in the right place.\u201d</p> <p>This is surprising, given that he had yet to come out and was still trying to \u201ccure\u201d himself of homosexuality. He was \u201ccertainly insecure\u201d, he says. \u201cBut I don\u2019t know if that really made me unhappy.\u201d</p> <p>It is hard to square his emotional \u201ccross-section\u201d with other evaluations he has made of life in those days. For example, 2009\u2019s Confessions of a Conjuror opens with a description of the self-loathing he felt while performing magic. It\u2019s not as if his parents disapproved. (When he told his mum he was going to be a magician, not an international lawyer, she said, \u201cOh, that sounds much more fun.\u201d) How does he explain the disjuncture?</p> <p>\u201cAsk any magician what they do and you will get the same, squirming answers,\u201d he replies. \u201cThere\u2019s something a bit embarrassing about saying you\u2019re a magician. It immediately suggests all these horrendous cliches, let alone that you\u2019re a grown-up doing a child\u2019s job. I think the opening words of my last book were \u2018I loathe myself\u2019. It\u2019s not how I feel now. It\u2019s not how I am now in relation to me now. It\u2019s part of any magician\u2019s relationship to their own craft.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4889314d419a4ae8a4c28ddf8e5d786e69517179\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4889314d419a4ae8a4c28ddf8e5d786e69517179/215_20_2164_1298/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Brown \u2018predicts\u2019 the correct Lottery numbers in 2009.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Brown \u2018predicts\u2019 the correct Lottery numbers in 2009.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Youtube</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But magic is just one element of the past for which Brown has expressed distaste. Tricks of the Mind, his 2006 book, begins with a vitriolic glance back at his Christian days \u2013 as a child growing up in Purley, south London, he attended Bible classes, and began to question his faith only during his university years, when an interest in magic and hypnosis took hold. \u201cIt\u2019s the intellectual faint-heartedness that feels embarrassing,\u201d he says. \u201cI do always look back and feel faintly embarrassed by anything I\u2019ve done in the past. I think that\u2019s not a terrible thing, because if you don\u2019t do that, how are you growing and moving forward?\u201d</p> <p>I worry that in a few years he will look back at his current incarnation \u2013 let\u2019s call it the Derren Brown: Philosopher phase \u2013 and cringe.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m sure I will, I\u2019m sure I will,\u201d he says, before finishing up with the words \u201c... so I don\u2019t think I will.\u201d When I notice the contradiction later and email him, he explains that his \u201cinstinct changed\u201d as he spoke. The latest book \u201ccomes from a richer place\u201d than the others. Maybe it will withstand his habit of retrospective loathing. \u201cI do naturally cringe a bit at most things I\u2019ve said or done in the past \u2026 \u201d he says. \u201cThat has generally been the pattern.\u201d</p> <p>With his thin, calm voice and his scrupulous politeness, I am struggling to picture Brown overwhelmed by happiness. Is his tranquillity ever scuppered by uncontrollable happiness? \u201cOh God, totally. I don\u2019t know if you do this as well? When you\u2019re with your partner, I think, does everyone else sing and do the stupid voices and all that stuff that I do and always have done?\u201d Crucially, he thinks this in the moment; his happiness is moderated by his awareness of it, and I wonder if that self-awareness is a necessary component of the happiness.<br></p> <p>In fact, when I ask what makes him happy, his partner is not the first reply. It\u2019s \u201cwriting in cafes, and painting\u201d \u2013 creative pursuits that \u201cget you out of your own head\u201d. But, of course, they don\u2019t really. They just make it OK to be in your head. His book is peppered with images of himself as author, sat in cafes in Norwich, Cardiff and Sheffield - small, subliminal suggestions, perhaps, that this is the authentic Brown, that the wizard behind the curtain is really a writer at a laptop.

Meaning doesn\u2019t happen in the moment without some sort of before and after, and a story being drawn out of it.\u201d</p> <p>The funny thing is that he resists applying that \u201cbefore and after\u201d to his own experience. He insists he is happy, and at any moment in which he revisits the past, confirms that that was a happy time \u2013 despite the fact that he looks back with \u201cself-loathing\u201d. It seems a curious trick of perspective, that each moment should be fine until it has passed, and then, with the benefit of hindsight, becomes hateful or, at least, embarrassing. No wonder he chooses to live in the present. I am beginning to wonder if his stoicism is the necessary defence against the more painful effects of self-scrutiny.</p> <p>\u201cTo approach [happiness] the other way, and see it as an absence of disturbances is helpful,\u201d he says, and although his words have the same weightless equanimity as always, the idea feels poignant.</p> <p>Towards the end of Happy, he writes of \u201crealising that we are all alone, that no one is ever entirely right for us because we are all broken, and that we can only open our broken aloneness to that of another\u201d. Happiness sounds like such a forlorn experience. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s a sad thing,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s only sad if you tell yourself it\u2019s sad.

  "<p>You didn\u2019t really join the&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.vanityfair.com/style/2004/02/oxford-university-dangerous-sports-club\">Dangerous Sports Club</a>; it was more a loose affiliation of people at Oxford University who enjoyed doing&nbsp;silly, slightly illegal things. They invented <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bungee_jumping\">bungee jumping</a>, with the world\u2019s first jump off the Clifton suspension bridge in Bristol on 1 April 1979. And they famously held a cocktail party on the island of Rockall. The first thing I&nbsp;got involved in was an attempt to do something with balloons at Beachy Head \u2013 I\u2019ve forgotten what. I&nbsp;didn\u2019t do anything dangerous until my first bungee jump, off a crane at a county fair in&nbsp;Winchester.</p> <p>One of the most fun times we had was our first skiing event at St Moritz. I cooked up an idea with a DSC member, Tommy Leigh-Pemberton: to go down the Matterhorn on bicycles attached to&nbsp;skis, with parachutes on our backs, which we\u2019d engage on&nbsp;the&nbsp;steeper bits.</p> <p>But the club\u2019s founder, David Kirke, wanted to expand it into an event with all sorts of things on skis.&nbsp;The most memorable was a&nbsp;rowing eight. I\u2019d hired the boat from&nbsp;my college club for \u00a325, with a&nbsp;\u00a375 deposit \u2013 the chap knew he wasn\u2019t going to get it back. It was mounted on skis, and stood three feet off the ground: eight rowers and&nbsp;me, the cox. It didn\u2019t get far before it turned over, but I righted it, jumped back in and made it to the bottom of the slope, travelling backwards. We also went down seated at a <a href=\"http://dafjones.photoshelter.com/gallery-image/The-Last-Hurrah/G0000h6nMRA9RkNU/I0000s_pC5DsZ_B0\">grand piano</a>; I had seen&nbsp;Elton John in concert and spent&nbsp;the evening working out how I&nbsp;could attach skis to a piano\u2019s legs.</p> <p>This photograph was taken at a DSC tea party held at the Gloucestershire home of the Dutch ambassador Robbert Fack; his twin sons, Jerome and Jack, were good friends. By our standards, it was pretty tame, although we did catapult people across the lawn in a&nbsp;wheelchair, using a bungee rope strung between trees. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/nigellalawson\">Nigella Lawson</a> is playing croquet; her boyfriend at the time was Hubie Gibbs, who is next to me at the back.</p> <p>We always wore formal dress, because it added to the spectacle.

Neil defended Rudd\u2019s actions on the grounds there was no proof she had done anything illegal. Yet the whole purpose of tax havens is to allow the wealthy to hide behind a wall of secrecy legally.</p> <p>Indeed, we only know of Rudd\u2019s past career because of the Bahamas leaks. When asked in interview some months ago if she had money in any offshore trusts, Rudd replied that she didn\u2019t. She also defended David Cameron over his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2016/apr/07/david-cameron-admits-he-profited-fathers-offshore-fund-panama-papers\" title=\"\">father\u2019s investment fund in the Bahamas </a>that was exposed by the Panama Papers. At least Cameron had the defence that the decision to set up a trust in the Bahamas was taken by his father.

They are more likely drawn there by the fact the islands demand no income, corporate or wealth taxes from individuals investing in offshore companies. No evidence has emerged that Rudd herself or the companies avoided paying tax but at the very least, a fuller statement explaining the purpose of the directorships and whether she personally profited from them seems reasonable.</p> <p>Unless Rudd makes such a statement it is difficult to see how Theresa May can continue to have confidence in her as home secretary.

Philip Berg, a former Pennsylvania official who supported Clinton, filed a lawsuit in 2008 over Obama\u2019s birth certificate; the suit was<a href=\"http://blogs.wsj.com/law/2014/01/29/supreme-court-ousts-attorney-who-sued-to-oust-obama/\"> thrown out because it was groundless</a>.

Such situations have become routine for the aid workers on the ground.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2016/sep/23/enough-is-enough-its-time-to-protect-aid-workers\">Enough is enough.

I ran to take a couple of cabbages back to my family. Every second I expected to be hit by a sniper. Because this plantation of cabbages was directly at the frontline.\u201d This is the experience of just one humanitarian worker in a besieged town in Syria.</p> <p>On top of their struggles, humanitarian workers are facing intense danger, risking their lives to save others. Many of the field staff I work with are crossing the frontlines on a daily basis, venturing out into conflict zones to reach those most in need and try to get aid and services to the most remote locations.</p> <p>\u201cIn Syria today, carrying humanitarian aid puts you in greater danger than carrying a weapon,\u201d according to one aid worker. Humanitarian aid outside the supervision of the government has been forbidden in Syria since 2012, as all aid is channelled through the Syrian Arab Red Crescent and other agencies registered with the Syrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Thus, the work of grassroots humanitarian groups and NGOs, such as our partners, working in opposition-controlled areas is effectively criminalised. Humanitarian workers who carry project documents or cash can be arrested. Having been involved in the Syria response since the beginning of the crisis, I have seen eight of our partner staff arrested in Syria. While some were lucky enough to escape or to be released after months, others are still in detention or have disappeared without a trace.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"15aa8a60eb559c555f4edb6c66bff9f67cd07dc1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/15aa8a60eb559c555f4edb6c66bff9f67cd07dc1/0_36_4096_2458/1000.jpg\" alt=\"UN emergency relief coordinator Stephen O\u2019Brien.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">UN emergency relief coordinator Stephen O\u2019Brien has said: \u2018If this week\u2019s callous attack is found to be a deliberate targeting of humanitarians, it would amount to a war crime.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Magali Girardin/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>People delivering humanitarian assistance face the danger of being put on trial before a military tribunal for \u201cfunding terrorist activities\u201d. Any assistance to civilian populations in opposition-controlled areas, any services provided to areas outside the government control, is considered by the authorities as an act of resistance, as tacit support for the opposition. Humanitarian assistance, which follows the principle of impartiality and neutrality, therefore has to be delivered in great confidentiality, through secret networks bound together by solidarity. Supplies are smuggled through tunnels and along dirt roads, over rivers and on the backs of donkeys through rough mountain terrain, in order to reach those communities that are cut off from all basic support.</p> <p>As the level of violence in Syria increased and the conflict turned into a civil war, an increasing number of armed groups sprang up, marginalising civil institutions in the opposition-held areas and limiting the space for social and humanitarian activities.</p> <p>Some groups exercise complete surveillance over any humanitarian activity in the areas under their control. This way, they aim to influence and shape humanitarian activities in line with their political agenda, setting school curricula, controlling access to health facilities and distribution points. In many of the areas controlled by armed groups, work has become impossible, while in other areas it is a constant struggle. \u201cOur dream was that humanitarian aid workers would enjoy international protection,\u201d said Dana, one of our partners, as if this basic demand that is enshrined in international humanitarian law is a utopian one.</p> <p>Using humanitarian access as a weapon of war, the warring parties do not only restrict people\u2019s access to aid, they also directly target humanitarian operations. While the bombing of the trucks on Monday night in Aleppo province constituted the first attack against an official UN convoy, it is sadly not the first time that humanitarian operations have come under fire. Medical facilities and schools are a regular target, as are warehouses and distribution points. In June 2016, <a href=\"http://www.unicef.org/media/media_91457.html\" title=\"\">six health facilities were bombed in a matter of two weeks</a>, according to Unicef.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/22/syria-obama-us-president-putin-russia\">The devastation of Syria will be Obama\u2019s legacy | Natalie Nougayr\u00e8de</a> </p> </aside>  <p>When the first aid convoy in over a year <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jun/01/syria-crisis-first-aid-convoy-enters-besieged-daraya-since-2012\" title=\"\">reached Darayya</a> in June 2016, the town was pounded with barrel bombs for two days, preventing civilians from accessing the distribution point. However, brave humanitarians across Syria do not give up hope. \u201cI am back at work today, where should I be?

Our hope is that the ceasefire will be renewed and pave the way for the end of the suffering and a political solution to the conflict.

  "<p><strong>My elder sister has always been tricky for me to deal with as she is very critical and suspicious of anyone\u2019s opinions or motives, and pulls everyone down for their life choices. For the sake of our elderly mother, we all try to bumble along but this has not been easy.</strong></p> <p><strong>Due to ill health, I have had more financial support from Mum than my sister, on the proviso that all will be evened out with any future inheritance. This has caused tensions between my sister and myself \u2013 understandably \u2013 but I have done my best to make sure everyone in the family knows and agrees about this. I have found it particularly difficult as my elder sister is two-faced about it \u2013 encouraging me to ask Mum for help against any \u201cfuture money\u201d while saying very horrible things to my other sister. </strong></p> <p><strong>My mother now has early onset dementia \u2013 her memory is poor, and Mum is anxious that we siblings all get on. Because of this, Mum will tell us different things, which of course makes honest communication between us all even more tricky.</strong></p> <p><strong>Mum has decided to move to live near my elder sister. We are all a bit sad about this (having offered for many years to have her live with us) but all want what\u2019s best for her.</strong></p> <p><strong>My sister has now become very difficult and refuses to involve my brother or me in any plans (she gets on with my younger sister). While with Mum recently, I read her post for her, to find that my elder sister has now been awarded power of attorney (PoA).</strong></p> <p><strong>Because I find my sister so slippery to deal with, as I find she moves the truth around to suit her defensive position, I thought long and hard about how to request that she keeps my brother and me in the loop. Her reply was simply, \u201cWhy should I?\u201d I just don\u2019t know how to deal with her and want very much to be fair.</strong></p> <p>Did your mother actively know and approve the power of attorney? Did she have capacity to do that? She can only grant PoA if she has capacity. And, in that case, only the person giving it \u2013 in this case your mother \u2013 can apply for it. Your sister should not have applied for it on her behalf.</p> <p>\u201cAny conversation about PoA,\u201d says Gary Rycroft, a solicitor and member of the Law Society wills and equity committee, \u201cshould start with the person who wants to give PoA saying, \u2018I\u2019d like to give PoA to \u2026\u2019 Not someone saying \u2018I\u2019d like to apply for PoA for \u2026\u2019\u201d</p> <p>In dealing with a tricky member of the family, my advice is to always pick the medium you best converse in \u2013 so if you can\u2019t talk to each other, could you consider email for communication? That way, too, you will have a record of what has been said.</p> <p>It\u2019s interesting that your younger sister gets on with her and I wonder if she could be the one to bring you all together in this? Does your elder sister keep the younger one in the loop about your mother\u2019s care?</p> <p>I\u2019ve taken out the location where your mother may be moving to as I didn\u2019t want to identify you, but note that if she does move outside England and Wales different laws may apply, according to where her assets are.</p> <p>How do your other siblings feel? If your mother wants you all to get on, is she aware that you can all be given PoA by her? Just because you don\u2019t get on very well with your sister, doesn\u2019t mean that she will mishandle your mother\u2019s affairs, but I do think that, even in the most convivial family, being transparent, united and correct in the way you handle things for an elderly person is a good idea.</p> <p>I think you and your other siblings need to establish exactly what your mother wants. This is key \u2013 it is her life and assets we are talking about. The questions to ask are:</p> <p>Who does she want to have as PoA? Does she know all her children can be given PoA? Does she want you to have PoA for property and finance or welfare and health or both (there are two types)? Is her will up to date and does it reflect \u2013 if she wants it to \u2013 who has already had money from her, such as you?</p> <p>\u201cWhen you do this, also ask your mum about her advance care planning and how she\u2019d like you to act on her behalf,\u201d says Rycroft.</p> <p>No one likes to look into a future where a parent can\u2019t decide things for themselves, but it can make difficult decisions further down the line so much easier.</p> <p>Contact the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/office-of-the-public-guardian\" title=\"\">Office of the Public Guardian</a> if you feel your mother\u2019s best interests are not being served \u2013 ie you have a concern about how your sister is handling your mother\u2019s affairs.</p> <p>Rycroft thinks the answer to your sister\u2019s question \u201cWhy should I?\u201d is simple: \u201cBecause we are also our mother\u2019s children and we care about what happens to her.\u201d</p> <p>Your priority is your mother and her care. If she is being well looked after, if her wishes are being followed and if she is not in any way being exploited, you may need to leave your difference with your sister to one side for now. But I still believe all of you should be involved with your mother and your sister\u2019s care of her should include keeping her siblings up to date.</p> <p><em>A useful link: </em><a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/courts-tribunals/court-of-protection\" title=\"\"><em>gov.uk/courts-tribunals/court-of-protection</em></a></p> <h2>Your problems solved<br></h2> <p>Contact Annalisa Barbieri, The Guardian, Kings Place, 90 York Way, London N1 9GU or email\u2008annalisa.barbieri@mac.com.

  "<p>Whenever I\u2019m feeling overwhelmed by work or other responsibilities, my first instinct is to make a plan. This usually involves drawing up a schedule of rigid severity. I\u2019ll get up an hour earlier! I won\u2019t check Twitter! Even though years of experience suggest it\u2019s impossible to write for more than five hours a&#xa0;day, this time, with a will of iron, I\u2019ll power through and write for eight! It\u2019s sort of adorable how sincerely I believe this will work, given that it never has. My supposedly bottomless well of self-discipline is revealed to be about a foot deep, and my efforts to transform my situation through sheer force of will end in a firestorm of recriminations, with me on both sides of it.</p> <p>We\u2019ve heard much in recent years about <a href=\"https://www.ted.com/talks/angela_lee_duckworth_grit_the_power_of_passion_and_perseverance?language=en\">the importance of inculcating \u201cgrit\u201d</a> in children \u2013 and&#xa0;quite a bit about <a href=\"http://www.newstatesman.com/culture/books/2016/06/talent-trap-why-try-try-and-trying-again-isn-t-key-success\">the limitations of that approach</a>. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/oct/30/oliver-burkeman-grit-is-it-all-its-cracked-up-to-be\">The psychological evidence</a> for the life\u2011changing benefits of grit turns out to be iffy. Besides, it\u2019s pretty obnoxious to imply that all you need to succeed, even if you are born into poverty, is to knuckle down and&#xa0;tough it out. Yet we rarely question the underlying assumption that self-discipline is a good trait to have; even the most liberal parents, who only want their kids to follow their dreams, would rather they did it in a self-disciplined way. Few people heed the warning of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Block\">the US psychologist Jack Block</a>, who undertook a&#xa0;landmark study of more than 100 toddlers, following them for three decades. True, too little self-control makes you impulsive, easily distracted and prone to dangerous risks. But too much self-control, Block found, can be a cause of misery, too.</p> <p>As the progressive educator Alfie Kohn points out in <a href=\"http://www.alfiekohn.org/article/self-discipline-overrated/\">his essay Why Self-Discipline Is Overrated</a>, the child who always completes her homework the moment it\u2019s assigned looks like a paragon of&#xa0;virtue. But the truth may be that she \u201cwants \u2013 or,&#xa0;more accurately, <em>needs </em>\u2013 to get the assignment out of the way in order to stave off anxiety\u201d. She may hate leaving anything unfinished, or feel that her worth depends on her performance.

It is something that is completely out of my control. That doesn\u2019t upset me, just gives me a feeling that it\u2019s hard. It\u2019s like when you want to protect people and you can\u2019t.

Of this he said: \u201cIt\u2019s a learning process, you make a mistake, especially the kind of individual mistake, you have to learn with what that means for the team, a team that works during the week on a game plan.</p> <p>\u201cSometimes not during the whole week for the same match because now we are having a game every three days - but to try to have a game plan, try to identify some defensive and attacking agreements between all of us, then in the game the individual mistake you can be punished by that.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/sep/22/jose-mourinho-manchester-united-master\">Manchester United\u2019s Jos\u00e9 Mourinho: no longer the bright young iconoclast | Jonathan Wilson</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cIt happened to us.

They won the Premier League because some of the big teams were not good enough last season, but they won because they were very good and they are still very good.</p> <p>\u201cI think they are a very easy team to analyse, a very easy team to understand. Their defensive process is clear, their attacking organisation is very easy to understand, too, but it is very difficult to cope with it. It is very difficult to keep a clean sheet against a team like Leicester and it is difficult to score goals against a team like Leicester. I keep repeating, easy to understand but difficult to play against.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>An undercover British army soldier has claimed he bugged a hospital and planted listening devices in the homes of senior Sinn F\u00e9in politicians years after the IRA ceasefire in 1994.</p> <p>The former intelligence soldier told the Guardian that many of the tiny cameras and minute bugs he secreted all over Northern Ireland were still in place years after he left a secret military unit.</p> <p>Senior Sinn F\u00e9in members, the including former IRA hunger striker Raymond McCartney, were still being targeted in secret surveillance operations until the 2000s, he said.</p> <p>\u201cWe put a bug into Raymond McCartney\u2019s house because we were not sure which way the republican movement was going in the early part of the 21st century.\u201d</p> <p>Se\u00e1n Hartnett (not his real name), who has just published a book about his part in the secret counterterrorism war, said republicans were \u201cstill gathering intelligence on the security forces in the early 2000s despite being on ceasefire, so we did the same on them\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThe bug I know was planted in Raymond McCartney\u2019s house was so sophisticated I would be hugely surprised if it has ever been found.\u201d</p> <p>Hartnett revealed that British military intelligence in the early 2000s hid tiny cameras and bugs in various places, including one inside Altnagelvin hospital in Derry, as part of its secret war against the Real IRA. He said many were probably still in place.</p> <p>Hartnett\u2019s memoir focuses on the seven years he served in the Joint Communications Unit Northern Ireland (JCUNI), formerly the controversial Force Research Unit, also known as the Det.</p> <p>He alleges that one of the undercover units he was working for was prepared to carry out a shoot-to-kill operation against a Real IRA cell outside an army base in Omagh just four years after the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/omagh\">terrorist group\u2019s bomb attack that killed 29 people in the County Tyrone town</a>.</p> <p>The 40-year-old former military spy-technician, who was born in Cork in the Irish Republic, said he would not return to the UK because he feared he could be arrested and prosecuted for breaching the Official Secrets Act. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2015/jul/09/northern-ireland-terror-shoot-to-kill\">Northern Ireland: when Britain fought terror with terror | Ian Cobain</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In an interview in Ireland, Hartnett said he was certain the advanced spying equipment his units used to monitor Real IRA and Ulster loyalists was now being used to watch Islamic State terror suspects in the UK.</p> <p>Although, he added, the devices he used while tracking Real IRA suspects and gathering \u201cpolitical intelligence\u201d on Sinn F\u00e9in were now even more advanced.</p> <p>\u201cThe technical advances they had made would lead even someone like me to struggle to pick out say a hidden camera in a parked vehicle these days,\u201d Hartnett said.</p> <p>He said that, just like in Northern Ireland, many of the cameras and listening devices hidden in homes, businesses, vehicles and other places in the rest of the UK would remain in place long after surveillance operations were wound down. \u201cNorthern Ireland is awash with bugs and secret cameras because, after all, we never went about taking them out when our operations were ended. The same will be true of any spying equipment that is planted in English cities and towns.\u201d</p> <p>Asked where the strangest place was that he had planted a listening device, Hartnett replied: \u201cDefinitely in Altnagelvin hospital in Derry. It was 2002 and after the Omagh bomb atrocity of 1998 the Real IRA had a resurgence. They were bombing again in Britain in the early 2000s; the rocket attack on MI5\u2019s headquarters and the bomb at the BBC come to mind. </p> <p>\u201cThere was one suspect/patient from Derry in the hospital who was being visited by another Real IRA operative and we wanted to know what they were taking about on these visits. So I was sent in personally to place the listening device where they were having their chats. To be honest it\u2019s probably still there.\u201d</p> <p>He repeated the allegation, made in his book Charlie One, that military intelligence was prepared to kill two Real IRA men on their way to kill British soldiers at an ATM in Omagh in 2002.</p> <p>\u201cThe Real IRA cell had the ATM at a garage under surveillance because soldiers from the nearby St Lucia army barracks in Omagh were using it to draw out cash. We had the team under surveillance and thanks to one our listening devices we had hard intelligence the Real IRA were going to use a motorbike to carry out a drive-by shooting as squaddies left the base to take out money at the ATM.</p> <p>\u201cI was told the plan was to surround the garage with undercover soldiers and open fire as the motorbike team turned up and the pillion passenger drew his gun. But at the last minute, the attempted hit on the soldiers didn\u2019t take place because the Real IRA team couldn\u2019t get their motorbike started. If the machine had started up these two men would be dead today. </p> <p>\u201cMy colleagues told me they were determined to take them out as one of them had been responsible for the murder of a police officer during the Troubles. Those Real IRA pair do not realise how lucky there were.\u201d</p> <p>Hartnett said his book originated while he was undergoing therapy for post-traumatic stress disorder after being discharged from the undercover army regiment in 2005.</p> <p> \u201cMy counsellor told me to write down all my experiences of the secret war and having amassed so many stories of my time in the Det I realised there was a book in this. </p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know if the British authorities will prosecute me for telling my story but I am not taking any chances and won\u2019t be back in the UK again.

Three of these came online in 2015, and have been blamed for a <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/climatechange-netherlands-idUSL8N1BH3AC\">5% rise in the country\u2019s emissions last year</a>.</p> <p>The Dutch Liberal MP and vice president of the parliament, Stientje van Veldhoven, told the Guardian: \u201cClosing down big coal plants \u2013 even if they were recently opened \u2013 is by far the most cost effective way to achieve the goals of the Paris agreement, and all countries will need to take such far-reaching measures. We cannot continue to use coal as the cheapest source of energy when it is the most expensive from a climate perspective.\u201d</p> <p>A court in the Netherlands <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/jun/24/dutch-government-ordered-cut-carbon-emissions-landmark-ruling\">last year ordered prime minister Mark Rutte\u2019s government</a> to cut its emissions by a quarter by 2020, citing the severity of the global warming threat which the Netherlands has recognised in international treaties. </p> <p>Dennis van Berkel, legal counsel for Urgenda, the group which brought the case, described the vote as \u201can enormous leap for climate policy in the Netherlands\u201d. The vote also calls for a 25% emissions cut by 2020.</p> <p>The country\u2019s centre-right coalition government is pursuing a twin-track response of appealing the ruling to the country\u2019s higher court, while preparing a climate package for early November. </p> <p>This could include limited coal plant closures, more funding for projects involving renewable energy, carbon capture and storage, and geothermal heating.</p> <p>Some environmentalists fear that the final package will involve a coalition deal that renders the parliamentary vote obsolete. The issue has been a divisive one in the Netherlands, with the Labour party, a coalition partner in Rutte\u2019s government, backing the opposition in yesterday\u2019s vote.</p> <p>The Dutch environment ministry was not immediately available to comment on the vote.

But having one coalition partner support it is always a good guarantee that an adopted motion will be enforced.\u201d</p> <p>Following passage of any new law, EU Emissions Trading System permits would also have to be reduced, to prevent a freak surplus lowering the price of carbon allowances, van Veldhoven said.</p> <p>The parliamentary vote follows a recent report by the consultancy CE Delft, which found that the cheapest way to meet the Netherlands\u2019 climate commitments would be to close one or two new coal stations. The paper, which was commissioned by <a href=\"http://www.eneco.com/about-us/about-eneco/\">Eneco</a>, a Dutch green power company, estimated this would cost the average household \u20ac30 (\u00a326) a year, but <a href=\"http://www.dutchnews.nl/news/archives/2016/09/95019-2/?utm_campaign=shareaholic&amp;utm_medium=linkedin&amp;utm_source=socialnetwork\">save them \u20ac80 a year on energy bills</a>.</p> <p>However, the Dutch government\u2019s economic ministry has tallied the bill for closing all of the country\u2019s coal plants by 2020 at \u20ac7bn. While this would have little effect on energy security and cut Holland\u2019s emissions by 31%, the CO2 savings would fall to just 9% due to a rise in coal-produced power imports, <a href=\"http://www.nltimes.nl/2016/07/13/report-closing-all-dutch-coal-plants-by-2020-to-cost-e7-billion/\">the report said</a>. </p>",
  "<p>Long tucked away behind the mountains of northwest Iran, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/gallery/2016/sep/02/iran-lake-urmia-in-pictures\">Lake Urmia</a> is becoming a national symbol of environmental degradation that is eliciting public sensitivity and awareness.

Actor Reza Kianian was one of the first to take up the call, using <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BJw4MrnAFDl/?taken-by=reza_kianian_official\">Instagram</a> to ask fellow Iranians to take responsibility for the lake. In his post Kianian stressed, <a href=\"http://www.yjc.ir/fa/news/5764013/%25D9%2587%25D8%25B4%25D8%25AA%25DA%25AF-%25D9%2585%25D9%2586-%25D8%25AF%25D8%25B1%25DB%258C%25D8%25A7%25DA%2586%25D9%2587-%25D8%25A7%25D8%25B1%25D9%2588%25D9%2585%25DB%258C%25D9%2587-%25D9%2587%25D8%25B3%25D8%25AA%25D9%2585-%25D8%25A7%25DB%258C%25D8%25AC%25D8%25A7%25D8%25AF-%25D8%25B4%25D8%25AF-%25D8%25A7%25DB%258C%25D9%2586%25D8%25B3%25D8%25AA%25D8%25A7%25D9%25BE%25D8%25B3%25D8%25AA%25E2%2580%258C%25D9%2587%25D8%25A7\">\u201cIf we save our lake, we will save ourselves\u201d</a>, reminding Iranians of their social responsibility for creating a more sustainable future. Kianian\u2019s plea has echoed across popular apps like <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/%25D9%2585%25D9%2586_%25D8%25AF%25D8%25B1%25D9%258A%25D8%25A7%25DA%2586%25D9%2587_%25D8%25A7%25D8%25B1%25D9%2588%25D9%2585%25D9%258A%25D9%2587_%25D9%2587%25D8%25B3%25D8%25AA%25D9%2585/\">Instagram</a> and on the newly formed \u201cI am Lake Urmia\u201d <a href=\"https://telegram.me/urmulake\">Telegram channel</a>. </p> <p>This is not the first effort to bring national and international attention to Lake Urmia. Iranian politicians including President Hassan Rouhani, Iranian parliamentary deputies, and even Hollywood star Leonardo DiCaprio have made Lake Urmia part of their public advocacy. DiCaprio\u2019s Instagram <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BFAZvGAKxHi/\">post</a> on the lake in May resulted in 328,000 likes and made him an <a href=\"http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2016/05/leonardo-dicaprio-instagram-lake-urmia-raise-awareness.html\">overnight superhero among Iranians</a>, illustrating the way social media can help collaboration on topics that defy borders. </p> <p>Travel to the basin of Lake Urmia and you will find an area facing a high risk of salt storms. The shrinking of the lake has diminished a fragile ecosystem, with the gradual disappearance of native wildlife including the brine shrimp Artemia and migratory birds like flamingos and pelicans. </p> <p>Such degradation threatens dire economic consequences. A once flourishing tourism industry, where visitors bathed in salty water rather like the Dead Sea, is curtailed. Many people living near the lake fear they may be forced to leave due to eye problems, respiratory diseases and other health problems caused by dust and salt particles blowing in the air. </p> <p>Twenty years ago, some local farmers referred to the lake as a tumour, viewing the seeping of its uniquely saline water as a threat to their farmlands. Today, their wish is to revitalise this desiccating lake and prevent salt storms that are diminishing soil fertility and threatening their livelihoods. The shift in perspective highlights the co-dependency we all share with our environment, and shows all too clearly the repercussions of environmental neglect.</p> <p>Iran suffers from <a href=\"http://ulrp.sharif.ir/en/news/news-1655-solve-water-crisis-iran-we-have-develop-both-mitigation-and-adaptation-measures\">\u201chydraulic mission\u201d</a> syndrome, a state of mind in which a country tries to manipulate domestic water resources to meet demand through short-sighted measures based on technology and large-scale engineering. The dream of human dominance over nature has led to a nightmare of unforeseen consequences, reminding us that we must learn to live in tune with nature to sustain ourselves.</p> <p>Dams, in particular, have become idolised as symbols of development, political strength and international prowess. One of the main factors contributing to the state of Lake Urmia is the interference in the natural flow of water into the lake by over 50 dams. The damage has been compounded by unregulated withdrawal of water, water-intensive irrigation and the unsustainable use of fertilisers.</p> <p>President Rouhani made promises about restoring Lake Urmia during his election campaign, and his administration has allocated <a href=\"http://foreignpolicy.com/2016/07/07/aperture-troubled-waters-iran-lake-urmia-environment-draught-water-preservation/\">$5 billion</a> to improve infrastructure and water conservation in the area. Nevertheless, the major proposals under consideration are still structural. While dam construction is now prohibited, the government\u2019s restoration task force has shown interest in transferring water from other river basins, upstream dredging, and connecting inflowing rivers to maximise the inflow. But without policy reforms and institutional changes - including phasing out <a href=\"http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/guest-blog/saving-iran-s-precious-lake-urmia/\">water intensive crops</a>, conservation methods in irrigation and wider changes in the behaviour of farmers and other water consumers - restoration efforts will be successful only with an unusually wet period in the years to come.</p> <p>Collaborations with international partners to restore water levels in Lake Urmia are limited but underway. Most notably, the United Nations Development Programme, Iran\u2019s Department of Environment and the Japanese government have established joint projects that involve educating local farmers on sustainable agriculture practices and reducing water consumption through improved efficiency; and supplying improved, safer fertilisers and pesticides. Over the past few months, the lake has shown some signs of recovery, but this is due more to more frequent rainfall rather than the restoration efforts.</p> <p>Lake Urmia\u2019s grim destiny unfortunately reflects a wider trend. Several bodies of water in Iran (including Gav-Khuni wetland near Isfahan, the Hamoun wetlands near Afghanistan, Bakhtegan lake in Fars province, and the Shadegan wetland and Hour-Al-Azim in Khuzestan) have been heavily impacted or dried up entirely in light of weak infrastructure, over-reliance on dams, extreme weather patterns, climatic changes, poor irrigation practices and unregulated use of water.</p> <p>In the story of Lake Urmia lie invaluable lessons. Iranians have paid for their unsustainable development and have lost many invaluable ecosystems. On the positive side, however, awareness of our interdependence with nature has been sharpened by air pollution in major cities, dust storms, soil erosion, desertification and land subsidence due to extraction of groundwater.</p> <p>Iran may now be reaching a tipping point. With the better understanding of our interconnectivity worldwide today, preserving the environment is a collective goal that everyone irrespective of age, race, or background can share. No matter where we are, or who we are, we can\u2019t save ourselves if we don\u2019t care for our environment. We are all Lake Urmia. </p> <p><em>Shirin Hakim is a doctoral researcher at the Centre for Environmental Policy of Imperial College, London, working on environmental issues in Iran.

The 2011 premiers against the best of 2012. The club with the likely Brownlow Medalist against the one with the AFL Rising Star. Geelong and Sydney are bona fide modern heavyweights.</p> <p>The Cats, with home state advantage and plenty of rest after just one match in the past month, start as favourites. The Swans, beaten up by the Giants and luckless with injury against the Crows, have flown interstate off a six day break. Theirs is a tall order.</p> <p>Quite literally based on the 22 Chris Scott has listed. Tom Hawkins will straighten up Geelong with his bulk up forward, and around him Rhys Stanley, Zac Smith, Marc Blicavs and Lachie Henderson will all spend time forcing Sydney defenders to play with their chins up. Much will be asked of Heath Grundy, Aliir Aliir and Dane Rampe against a side with the most number of marks inside 50 for the year.</p> <p>The opposite is the case at the other end of the ground where Geelong\u2019s defence matches up tall against Sydney\u2019s forward line. Lance Franklin\u2019s duel with Tom Lonergan will be eye catching but could prove a sideshow compared to the involvement of Ben McGlynn and Tom Papley at ground level. The recalled Jed Bews has been picked to perform a vital job.</p> <p>In between we know what to expect. The Swans bat deeper than anybody in midfield but the Cats possess the most dynamic one-two combination. Some tantalising head to heads are bound to materialise over the course of the night.</p> <p>It\u2019s preliminary final weekend, kicking off with two evenly matched sides in front of a packed MCG.

  "<p>It is unusual to enter my teenage daughter\u2019s room without some degree of hazard. There are teetering piles of detritus. There are mugs with green liquid in them. There are sometimes surprising odours, not all of them pleasant. So why don\u2019t I tell her to clean it up? Well, I do, occasionally, but not with much determination or hope of compliance, partly because I find the traditional objection to this kind of parental instruction hard to argue against \u2013 \u201cIt\u2019s my room, what\u2019s your problem?\u201d</p> <p>One can make the conventional response \u2013 \u201cActually, if you check the legal documents, you\u2019ll find that, technically, it\u2019s my room\u201d \u2013 but this doesn\u2019t get you very far, and can take you down one of those logical rabbit burrows at the end of which inevitably lies, \u201cWell, you didn\u2019t have to have me in the first place did you?\u201d The point is, their room is indeed, in spirit if not legally, their space. Maybe we should just leave them to wallow in it.</p> <p>I suspect my wife thinks I\u2019m lax for entertaining such views and I was tempted to agree, until my lack of resolve was stiffened by a recent article in the New York Times headlined \u201c<a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/12/opinion/sunday/should-i-make-my-daughter-clean-her-room.html?_r=0\" title=\"\">Should I Make My Daughter Clean Her Room?</a>\u201d. The self-confessed control-freak mother answers the question with a rather reluctant, but finally resounding no.</p> <p>She suggests that the \u201cJackson Pollock-inspired crash scene\u201d that is her 15-year-old daughter\u2019s room needs to be kept under control, but that the mother\u2019s \u201cimpulse to tidy can be compulsive, a way to maintain control in the face of anxiety\u201d.</p> <p>It\u2019s a sound insight. Part of the reason we want our children to clean their rooms is the same reason we want them to eat their greens. It is symbolic rather than logical. We worry about it because we have a low emotional tolerance of chaos, even other people\u2019s chaos confined within four walls.</p> <p>If you want to be less philosophical, you could argue that your children&#xa0;should maintain a tidy space&#xa0;because untidy spaces are inefficient and look ugly. But again, it\u2019s not your space, so why worry? You can plead hygiene, but the number of teenagers suffering serious infections as a result of poor room-hygiene, so far as I am aware, remains remarkably low.</p> <p>You could say that tidying is teaching them how to survive in the outside world, but I think that\u2019s a rationalisation. Some children are tidy and some are not, and there\u2019s nothing much you can do about it. Untidy people muddle through somehow \u2013 I know, because I\u2019m one of them.</p> <p>There are other good reasons to refrain from endlessly nagging teenagers about cleaning up their room. If my daughter is anything to go by, they work extremely hard at school and have little enough agency when they get home. Giving them some control and a space to call their own is psychologically important.</p> <p>But there are limits. Once&#xa0;you discover rodent droppings or, for&#xa0;that matter, rodents, under the bedside table, some action needs to be&#xa0;taken. But more often&#xa0;than not, our response should be \u2013 let it go. As a psychologist quoted in the NYT article observed, \u201cThe more you make it an issue, the more you\u2019ll prolong the problem.\u201d Another psychologist made a different, but equally pertinent point. \u201cWhat\u2019s important for children is structure,\u201d she said, \u201cwhich is not necessarily the same thing as a clean&#xa0;room.\u201d</p> <p>If you need further convincing, read Anne Tyler\u2019s wonderful book Tumble Tower. It\u2019s about the beauty, or at least the necessity, of mess. The trouble it\u2019s a children\u2019s\u2019 book \u2013 and it\u2019s not children who need to read it. It\u2019s us.</p> <p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/timlottwriter\" title=\"\">@timlottwriter</a></p>",

  "<p>Teachers and bus drivers need training to tackle \u201cblatant and latent\u201d prejudice and indifference before it escalates into hate crime, according to a new report.</p> <p>The recommendations from the Scottish government\u2019s independent advisory group on hate crime, prejudice and community cohesion, published on Friday, suggest that responsibility for tackling hate crime in society should extend beyond the criminal justice system. </p> <p>In the first major investigation into hate crime in Scotland since a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/sep/19/embassies-alleged-hate-crimes-since-brexit-vote\">significant rise in alleged incidents was reported</a> across the UK following the Brexit vote in June, the group examined how external events \u2013 such as the terrorist attacks in Paris, the EU referendum and football matches \u2013 made some people feel that they had \u201cpermission\u201d to attack others on the basis of their identity.</p> <p>The inquiry was led by Duncan Morrow, from the University of Ulster, who previously chaired a similar group set up by the Scottish government to investigate sectarianism, and examined the day-to-day experiences of those facing prejudice based on their race, faith, sexual orientation, gender identity or disability.</p> <p>Many of the report\u2019s recommendations are focused on ensuring that the criminal justice response to hate crime is clear, swift and consistent. In particular, the report criticises the patchy operation across the UK of the existing third-party reporting system. </p> <p>Morrow said, however, that hate crime needed to be treated as a citizenship as much as justice issue. </p> <p>\u201cIn addition to supporting improvement in criminal justice, there needs to be a recognition that these kind of crimes emerge from a background of blatant and latent prejudice and indifference which festers far beyond individual attacks,\u201d he said. </p> <p>\u201cAttacks on people because of their identity with a group get traction in a climate where perpetrators may feel that they are acting \u2018with permission\u2019, or \u2018with the sympathy of the wider community\u2019, both spoken and unspoken.\u201d</p> <p>Morrow said that many of those interviewed for the report described a \u201cconstant drip of insult, harassment and verbal abuse\u201d as an everyday normality\u201d, resulting in loss of confidence and social isolation. \u201cYet most of this never reaches the threshold of crime, and more often than not there are few witnesses.\u201d</p> <p>He said one solution was to train bystanders to intervene. \u201cSchools and teachers are often in the front line. Youth workers, transport providers and community organisations are often in a position to act more immediately and more effectively. Identifying ways for people to act without putting themselves at risk is important.</p> <p>\u201cWhat we would like to see is training for people in immediate responsibility, like school teachers or bus drivers, and education on how to report and respond to violent incidents for the general public.\u201d</p> <p>In recent years, Police Scotland has developed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/jul/08/rape-prevention-campaign-young-men-police-scotland-advert\">bystander training as a key part of its strategy to tackle sexual and domestic violence</a>. The force has worked with bar and club owners, for example, to train staff to recognise situations where a woman may be vulnerable to sexual assault, and teach them to intervene safely.</p> <p>Morrow\u2019s report focused on public transport as \u201ca particular kind of enclosed space where a vulnerable individual was often more at risk\u201d. He described it as \u201cemblematic of the unexpected places where hate crime becomes real\u201d. </p> <p>\u201cPeople stopping travelling or going out at night may feel like small steps, but they have significant impact on community cohesion and a sense of public safety,\u201d he said. </p> <p>The report suggests the Scottish government consider changes to the legal framework governing hate crime in Scotland, including extending protection to include gender, age and membership of other groups such as refugees and asylum seekers. </p> <p>It also calls for measures to improve the monitoring of online hate crime and prejudice, and responses to it.</p> <p>The Equality and Human Rights Commission in Scotland welcomed the report. Its director, Alastair Pringle, said: \u201cThis is fundamentally a responsibility for all of us in Scotland. We all have a part to play, from the Scottish government, to our schools, to our workplaces, to each of us all as individuals. </p> <p>\u201cI was struck by a recent reported case where several passengers complained about the offensive behaviour and racist language from other passengers on a flight to Ibiza last week. This resulted in their removal from the flight. </p> <p>\u201cI think this demonstrates exactly how we can make a change in society by refusing to be a bystander, showing responsible leadership by example and speaking up and being an active citizen.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>A year ago on Monday England were leading Wales by seven points entering the final 11 minutes of their pivotal Rugby World Cup pool game at Twickenham. Everyone <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/sep/26/england-wales-rugby-world-cup-match-report\">remembers the punchline</a> \u2013 Gareth Davies\u2019s party-pooping try, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2015/sep/26/england-v-wales-rugby-world-cup-2015-live\">the doomed decision to kick for the corner</a>, the painful <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/oct/04/england-crash-out-of-rugby-world-cup\">Wallaby <em>coup de grace</em></a>. For Northampton\u2019s Tom Wood who has not featured since the tournament, it will always be a subject laced with nagging regret.</p> <p>Wood is still a professional rugby player, instinctively programmed to look forward rather than back. He knows \u201cwhat ifs\u201d are the currency of delusion; as captain of a Saints team preparing to host Wasps, he has more pressing priorities than wallowing in self-pity. A resurgent England are also due to unveil an autumn international squad next Friday and the ever-competitive Wood has not yet abandoned hope of a recall.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/sep/22/bath-twickenham-the-rec-future-april-decision\">Bath announce Twickenham date with The Rec\u2019s future set for October decision</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Is there not a part of him, either way, that occasionally wonders what might have been? The hirsute flanker, for one, will go to his grave convinced England were a decent side who could have gone much further. \u201cWe had a very good team capable of doing better and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/jun/25/australia-england-third-test-match-report\">the team over the last year has proven that</a>,\u201d he says evenly. \u201cThey\u2019re not vastly different sides. You can\u2019t say one player playing over another is the difference. It\u2019s just not. The players who are there now are not 10 times better than the ones who were out on the World Cup pitch.\u201d</p> <p>Closer inspection, in fact, reveals seven changes and one positional switch from the XV against Wales compared with Eddie Jones\u2019s regular lineup. Brad Barritt, Sam Burgess, Tom Youngs, Geoff Parling and Wood have not reappeared for England, Jonny May has been injured and Courtney Lawes has slipped to the bench. The big winners under Jones have been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2016/feb/20/dylan-hartley-rugby-england\">Dylan Hartley</a>, James Haskell, George Kruis and George Ford, with Maro Itoje bringing a further fresh dimension, but all save the suspended Hartley were available to Stuart Lancaster.</p> <p>\u201cThe outcome was unbelievably disappointing because we had such high hopes,\u201d continues Wood. \u201cIt\u2019s easy for people to laugh at that now but we\u2019ve achieved \u2013 and when I say we, I mean England \u2013 quite a lot since then. That\u2019s what we\u2019re capable of and, by and large, it\u2019s with the same group of players. That\u2019s what we were envisaging for ourselves [but] we didn\u2019t quite nail it. We had such high ambitions that didn\u2019t amount to very much.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2015/oct/04/england-rugby-world-cup-stuart-lancaster-10-reasons\">So what did go wrong</a>? Wood, who turns 30 in November and has won 42 caps for his country, dismisses suggestions the squad were not fit enough. \u201cPhysical fitness was not the issue, I can absolutely guarantee that. Whether it\u2019s mental sharpness or application \u2026 well, there\u2019s always improvement to be made in those areas.\u201d Would he change anything with hindsight? \u201cFrom the players\u2019 point of view, no. And it\u2019s not for me to criticise the coaching regime or discuss the rights and wrongs of selection. There genuinely isn\u2019t anything I look back on and think: \u2018That was why it went wrong\u2019 or \u2018I wouldn\u2019t have done that.\u2019 For a number of reasons, it just didn\u2019t happen for us. Often it is something indefinable. There is just a feeling you get when things are going well and you\u2019re happy with everything about the regime. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s something you can always define or say: \u2018Get that right and you\u2019ll win.\u2019 That\u2019s just sport.\u201d</p> <p>Like many he is glad <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/sep/05/stuart-lancaster-leinster-senior-coach-till-end-of-season\">Lancaster is finally back in rugby with Leinster</a>. \u201cHe\u2019s got too much to offer the game to not be involved. Leinster are lucky to have him.\u201d If Wood, now cured of the neck problem that \u201cbogged me down\u201d last season, can also resurrect his international career it really would be a victory for cussed warrior spirit. \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/mar/06/tom-wood-eddie-jones-england-northampton\">There\u2019s not been a huge amount of dialogue</a>,\u201d he acknowledges.</p> <p>\u201cEddie wished me well for the start of the season but that could be a generic message he sent to half the Premiership. He did say he\u2019d heard I was feeling good following my operation and was looking forward to seeing me play. As far as I\u2019m aware the ball is in my court.\u201d</p> <p>It will not be easy. Jones has successfully redeployed Chris Robshaw at No6 and back-row pretenders such as Teimana Harrison, Nathan Hughes and Dave Ewers all have youth on their side. Harlequins\u2019 Jack Clifford has been ruled out of the autumn internationals, bumping Wood one rung up the ladder at least.</p> <p>The Saints captain, nevertheless, is not ready to go rocking-chair shopping: \u201cI look back with a huge amount of pride at what I\u2019ve achieved \u2026 but I\u2019m not suggesting for a second I don\u2019t care about playing for England [again]. I do care and I do want it. If I get the call I\u2019ll be ready to train and play. But I know my best route back, if it were ever to happen, is to have my head down here at the club and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/sep/11/bristol-northampton-premiership-match-report\">get Northampton somewhere near the top of the league</a>.\u201d</p> <p>That ambition will hinge on weekends like this against opponents such as Hughes, the Fijian-born Wasp now eligible to represent England. The twist is that Wood hails from Coventry, where Wasps are now based, and he has a keen sense of the shifting tectonic plates in Midlands rugby. Had Wasps moved 10 years earlier he would probably have worn black and yellow \u2013 \u201cI do look back and think how much more convenient it would have been\u201d \u2013 and he senses sceptical diehards will come round eventually: \u201cThere was a lot of talent in the area that was probably overlooked in the past. Playing Wasps will soon become a derby fixture if you\u2019re both challenging for top four spots.\u201d</p> <p>There has always been much to admire about Wood, the most articulate of rugby soldiers. He has a lust for life away from the game \u2013 archery, shooting, off-roading \u2013 and has fought his way back from some soul-sapping injuries. So when he insists \u201cmy best rugby is yet to come\u201d and talks about the desire of England \u201coutcasts\u201d such as Ben Foden, Luther Burrell and himself to resurrect their Test careers as their team-mate Dylan Hartley has done, it feels churlish to doubt him. \u201cThere\u2019s no part of me that wants England to fail so I can climb the ladder somehow. If and when I play for England I want to play on merit in a top-quality team, not because there\u2019s nobody else and we\u2019re doing awful. That\u2019s not my aspiration.\u201d The past 12 months, if anything, have made him even more determined to deliver for both club and country.</p>",
  "<p>The danger in having a moon village as your vision for the future is that people get the wrong impression. The mind leaps ahead and lands on a movie set: a giant dome shelters a huddle of homes, a bank of generators, and a modestly-stocked shop that doubles as the post office. A lost spacefarer with a PhD in botany clings to life by growing spuds in human faeces.</p> <p>The idea is so easily misconstrued that Jan Woerner, the director general of the European Space Agency (ESA), makes clear from the start what the moon village is not. \u201cLet me tell you what it won\u2019t mean,\u201d he says. \u201cSingle houses, a school, a church, a swimming pool, a bakery, an undertaker. This is not what I\u2019m thinking about.\u201d<br></p> <p>What he does have in mind is the future of human space exploration. In a decade or so, the International Space Station will be done with. The $150bn outpost will plunge back to Earth in a fireball above the Pacific Ocean leaving astronauts with nowhere to go. If humans want to maintain a presence in space, they need a new plan, and soon.<br></p> <p>While Nasa remains fixated on sending people to Mars - a challenge of daunting technical difficulty - ESA under Woerner sees the moon as the obvious next venture for a long time to come. The \u201cvillage\u201d he has in mind is a diverse community of public and private organisations that work on the moon together. A band of nations might build a telescope on the far side of the moon, where observations are shielded from Earth\u2019s electromagnetic din. A single agency could test whether robots can make radiation-proof habitats from lunar regolith. A tech firm could extract water from polar ice and turn some into hydrogen, oxygen and rocket fuel. Another might break into lunar tourism.<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a1949b78b753beb5a65e683d1e2a0e579dcba0ad\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a1949b78b753beb5a65e683d1e2a0e579dcba0ad/96_0_2343_1406/1000.jpg\" alt=\"ESA\u2019s Jan Woerner is quick to point out that his moon village vision is not \u201csingle houses, a school, a church, a swimming pool, a bakery, an undertakers.

In time, Woerner says, it would build up the vital infrastructure and practical know-how that humans will need to head more safely into the farther reaches of the solar system.<br></p> <p>Woerner has kicked the idea around for a while, but will raise it formally with ESA\u2019s ministerial council for the first time later this year. \u201cIt\u2019s an inspiring concept, and if others have a better idea, I am ready to change my mind. But so far I can tell you that the moon village is my favourite solution for the future,\u201d he told the Guardian. \u201cThe moon is the next logical stepping stone.\u201d<br></p> <p>He has plenty of support. \u201cThe question is what to do after the space station,\u2019 says Ian Crawford, professor of planetary science at Birkbeck, University of London. \u201cEither nothing follows and you shut down human space exploration, or you build another space station \u2013 and it\u2019s hard to see the point of that \u2013 or you go somewhere else, and I strongly believe the moon is the next place to go.\u201d<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>It is more a necessity than a desire, Crawford says. Before we head to Mars \u2013 or any other faraway body \u2013 humans must learn how to thrive in dusty, high radiation environments. \u201cTo send people to Mars you have to be very confident in all aspects of the technology,\u201d he says. \u201cGoing to the moon is risky too, but the advantage of learning and trialling all this stuff on the moon is that if something goes wrong, you can bring people back. The moon is only three days away. Abort options exist.\u201d<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>The moon itself is a laboratory. An archive of solar system history, the signatures of meteorites, comets and the solar wind are written in the dust. A moon village would give scientists the means to explore the body, a lump of the ancient Earth, much as Antarctic bases have opened up the southern continent.<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"45e045e3974fee56dd06e8aab6ce75fd684c004c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/45e045e3974fee56dd06e8aab6ce75fd684c004c/37_0_2790_1674/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The moon village has plenty of parallels with polar outposts.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The moon village has plenty of parallels with polar outposts.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: ESA/Foster + Partners</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The moon village has plenty of parallels with polar outposts. The US McMurdo research centre on the tip of Ross Island began as a handful of buildings in the 1950s. It has now grown to more than 100 structures and a population of 1000 in the summer months. The settlement has an airport, a water distillation plant, sewers and a waste management centre, all needed to support the dormitories, clubs and research facilities. Scientists at the base make space weather observations, study microbes that thrive under glaciers, drill ice cores to obtain 100,000 year records of Earth\u2019s atmospheric greenhouse gas levels, and send out robotic submarines to map the underneath of sea ice.</p> <p>Next year, the US company <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2016/aug/03/us-startup-moon-express-2017-lunar-mission\">Moon Express</a> hopes to land the first commercial spacecraft on the moon. The polar regions are thought to harbour vast reserves of ice that can be melted into water, split into hydrogen and oxygen, and turned into rocket fuel. Bob Richards, a co-founder of the company, has called the moon a \u201cgas station in the sky\u201d. Naveen Jain, the chairman, told the Guardian it is time entrepreneurs had the chance to show what they can do there. \u201cIf ESA wants to enable private enterprises to do what they do best, then I absolutely support it,\u201d he said.<br></p> <p>The prospect of turning the moon into a mine may not please everyone, and Crawford says that international legislation around the resources should be strengthened. But he sees no moral objection to mining. \u201cThe reason we have qualms about it on Earth is we are damaging the habitats of other living things we share the planet with. The moon is essentially a dead rock, and it must be preferable to exploit bodies that don\u2019t have any indigenous life on them.\u201d<br></p> <p>Under George W. Bush, Nasa planned to return to the moon and build a permanent polar base. But the plan was shelved by Barack Obama, who explained his decision with a blunt \u201cwe\u2019ve been there before.\u201d Even after the Apollo missions, the idea that Nasa has been there and done the moon is nothing but \u201cthe most superficial geopolitical soundbite,\u201d says Crawford.<br></p> <p>Jeff Hoffman, a former Nasa astronaut, believes humans need to go back to the moon as soon as possible. \u201cIt has been nearly 50 years since we explored a planetary surface and we need to get some experience. The problem with a \u2018moon village\u2019 would be if the infrastructure is so costly to build and maintain that resources for Mars get sucked up,\u201d he says. \u201cPlans for lunar exploration need to be done in a way to enhance our ability to get to Mars, not handicap it.\u201d<br></p> <p>Katherine Joy, a lunar scientist at Manchester University, says that while an international consensus is supposed to exist in the form of the <a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/content/just-released-updates-to-the-global-exploration-roadmap\">Global Exploration Roadmap</a>, a clear plan is still needed. \u201cA pathway needs to be decided soon,\u201d she says. \u201cThat is the strength of the moon village concept. It provides an ambitious vision that can bring people together.\u201d<br></p> <p>\u201cA lunar base isn\u2019t a distraction from our desire to visit and explore Mars,\u201d she adds. \u201cWhat we learned from Apollo is that touch-and-go-style missions are exciting, and scientifically rewarding, but they don\u2019t lead to a sustained human presence on a different world.\u201d <br></p> <p>Exploration and learning how to survive on an alien world is only part of the space game. For decades, missions in Earth orbit and out into the solar system have bound countries together. The International Space Station operates only because Americans, Russians, Europeans and others work side-by-side and trust each other. As Britain prepares to leave the EU, the moon village might do for Europe what politicians could not, Woerner believes. \u201cSpace has the power to join forces in Europe - and even beyond Europe,\u201d he says. \u201cWe should use it for the sake of humankind.\u201d<br></p>",
  "<p>They are the scourge of the world\u2019s capitals. They flout the law and cost the authorities millions. Yet, like mice, noise and traffic jams, there seems to be little any city can do to protect itself from diplomats. </p> <p>Immunity from prosecution under the Vienna Convention may be a vital part of international relations, but it does little good for the moral fibre of the individuals involved.</p> <p>As of April in Canberra, Australia, diplomats representing various foreign powers owed the city <a href=\"http://www.canberratimes.com.au/national/public-service/canberras-foreign-diplomats-have-500000-in-unpaid-speeding-red-light-traffic-fines-20160417-go8m9o.html\">more than A$500,000</a> (\u00a3290,000) \u2013 mostly in unpaid parking fines. Tickets for running red lights and speeding were also common. Saudi Arabian diplomats alone owed nearly A$140,000. </p> <p>In New York, meanwhile, the total bill for parking tickets issued to UN diplomats was <a href=\"http://iquantny.tumblr.com/post/140432262249/parking-immunity-diplomats-owe-nyc-16-million-in\">more than $16m</a> (\u00a312.3m) as of March. Here Egypt was by far the worst offender, with a debt of nearly $2m, although more than a third of that was the handiwork of just four cars. One of them \u2013 registration 001 THD \u2013 accrued $109,165 in fines from 1,985 offences, many of which date back to the last century. Since then, with added penalties, the total has more than doubled. Who knows whether the malefactor is still in New York, or even still alive?</p> <p>In London, diplomats failed to pay 4,858 parking fines in last year alone, <a href=\"https://hansard.parliament.uk/commons/2016-07-21/debates/16072152000034/UnpaidParkingFines\">creating \u00a3477,499 of debt</a> (\u00a3161,328 of which was later waived or paid).

Diplomats tend to argue the second, because it just so happens that they are also immune from tax as well as from prosecution. The US reached this view in 2005.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"64f50ae4e005094f312931b71651fed4a2be38fb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/64f50ae4e005094f312931b71651fed4a2be38fb/0_1403_1960_1176/1000.jpg\" alt=\"c\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Diplomats failed to pay 4,858 parking fines in London last year alone.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Levene/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cThey can\u2019t be forced in court to pay a fine,\u201d says a former British diplomat, who asked not to be named, \u201cso there\u2019s no legal redress against them. All that the government or the local authority can do is to try to use persuasion, which, as we all know, doesn\u2019t work.\u201d</p> <p>No, it doesn\u2019t. But there have been encouraging moments in cities around the world. In 2002, New York achieved a drastic reduction in unpaid fines by refusing to re-register any car with a large outstanding debt. (Since then, though, the fines have gradually crept back up.) The UK introduced a stricter policy in 1985 and in one year reduced the number of annual parking fines not paid by diplomats from 92,285 to 33,904.</p> <p>Even so, such signs of improvement help to simply hide how normal the practice has become. \u201cI suspect that in some cases the parking wardens don\u2019t bother,\u201d says the former diplomat. \u201cIn the past, wardens used to regularly put tickets on diplomatic vehicles, but there was never any belief they\u2019d be paid.\u201d </p> <p>If a diplomatic car is causing an obstruction it can at least be towed away, but drunk or dangerous drivers have to be freed once their credentials have been established. Sometimes this has terrible results. In Ottawa, Canada, in January 2001, a senior Russian diplomat, Andrei Knyazev, <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/1881488.stm\">lost control of his car</a> on the way back from an ice-fishing party and mounted the pavement, killing one person and seriously injuring another. Knyazev insisted he had not been drinking but would not allow himself to be breathalysed, and the Russian authorities refused to waive his immunity. It subsequently emerged that Knyazev had been stopped for driving drunk twice before, but released. In the end he was prosecuted in Russia and sentenced to four years in prison.</p> <p>This is not an isolated example. A Georgian diplomat, Gueorgui Makharadze, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/1997/10/09/us/georgian-diplomat-pleads-guilty-in-death-of-teen-age-girl.html?_r=0\">killed a 16-year-old girl</a> while driving drunk in Washington DC in 1997, and was later prosecuted after his government waived his immunity. In 2009, Silviu Ionescu, a Romanian charg\u00e9 d\u2019affaires, <a href=\"http://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/courts-crime/ex-romanian-diplomat-silviu-ionescu-dies-a-look-back-at-the-hit-and-run-case\">drove into three pedestrians in Singapore</a>, killing one.

The study, conducted by the economists Raymond Fisman and Edward Miguel in 2006, found no non-payments from officials in Japan, Canada, Turkey, Sweden or the UK, while the worst offenders were Kuwait, Egypt and Chad.

  "<p>One of Andrew Lansley\u2019s failings as health secretary was his apparent belief that the only reason he was under attack from all sides for his NHS reforms was because people had not grasped what he was trying to do. The solution was not to listen to their concerns, but for him to explain it all one more time.</p> <p>Four years later he is still explaining, and still not listening. Delivering the <a href=\"https://www.nhsproviders.org/news-blogs/blogs/a-new-covenant-for-the-nhs\">NHS Providers\u2019 annual lecture</a> this week Lansley failed to demonstrate any understanding that the <a href=\"http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2012/7/contents/enacted\">Health and Social Care Act</a> he drove through created huge disruption and enduring difficulties.</p> <p>One vignette during his speech was illuminating. He wittily deployed the Zhou Enlai line \u201cIt\u2019s too early to say\u201d, in relation to judging the impact of his reforms, but then bludgeoned any amusement out of it by deconstructing the precise circumstances in which the phrase had originally been used. One of his flaws is that he can never see the big picture for the detail.</p> <p>He never recognised the fact that each discrete part of his system may have had virtues, but when you put it all together it didn\u2019t work. Competition has its place but not at the expense of collaboration. Autonomy for clinical commissioners sounds a powerful concept but they need organisations with the resources and geography to have clout. Having a maze of central bodies with sometimes conflicting priorities creates confusion and holds back change. Patients desperately need a louder voice in the system but Healthwatch is demonstrably not it. Trying to commission primary care centrally was never going to work. The NHS needs to make sense regionally as well as nationally and locally.</p> <p>Lansley proudly reminded the audience that he had introduced a requirement to integrate services \u2013 as if all that was needed to make it happen was a new law, rather than creating the conditions to encourage it. Meanwhile the labyrinthine structure and hugely complex commissioning system, particularly around primary and specialist care, drove the service in the opposite direction.</p> <p>He dismissed the notion that the structural upheaval to implement reforms had created massive cost and disruption, claiming it has saved billions of pounds. He is oblivious to the two years of distraction from the NHS\u2019s productivity drive \u2013 the \u201cNicholson challenge\u201d\u2013 which was intended to prepare the service for leaner economic times after the 2008 crash. The folly of that is now apparent.</p> <p>He does not seem to realise that a huge industry has grown up in and around the NHS to find ways round and through his reforms \u2013 time, energy and money that could have been spent driving improvements to care.</p> <p>But Lansley still landed some punches. He compared the BMA with \u201creal trade unionists\u201d such as Unison, whose goal is to find a solution, and questioned why it is that the NHS never has quite the right amount of funding to promote reform \u2013 when it has plenty it doesn\u2019t see the need, and when cash gets tight it can\u2019t afford to change.</p> <p>He highlighted how the autonomy of NHS England and the devolved powers for clinical commissioners had given the system the freedom to respond to the current difficulties with new structures and approaches.</p> <p>A central plank of his reforms was moving public health to local government to join it up with other services such as education and housing, while turning the focus of the Department of Health towards public health. It is not his fault that public health funding has been cut, and that Hunt has not read the script about keeping politicians out of day-to-day NHS decision-making.</p> <p>Lansley\u2019s passion for the NHS is undiminished. He seized the opportunity of the lecture to restate his intentions behind the reform programme, such as greater autonomy from politicians and the NHS high command, championing outcomes over process and giving clinicians a greater voice.</p> <p>But failing to acknowledge the serious flaws in the structures and systems he introduced, which from the very beginning seriously impeded the running of the NHS, was naive and complacent.</p> <p><strong><a href=\"https://register.theguardian.com/healthcare-professionals/?CMP=dis-166\">Join the Healthcare Professionals Network</a> to read more pieces like this.

  "<p>A key priority of Hillary Clinton\u2019s proposed intelligence surge will be to kill or capture Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, her campaign has told the Guardian.<br></p> <p>During the past year, Clinton, the former secretary of state and Democratic presidential nominee, has placed bolstering the vast US intelligence apparatus at the center of her national security agenda. </p> <p>Days before the first presidential debate \u2013 and after the New York area escaped without mass casualties from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/19/new-york-bombing-both-devices-used-pressure-cooker-and-phone-reports\">multiple bombings</a> \u2013 her campaign has for the first time expanded on how her policies would work.</p> <p>Since its 2015 inception, the \u201cintelligence surge\u201d has evolved from an idea of expanding intelligence assets directed against the Islamic State and its adjuncts to a broader initiative with a significant domestic component, aimed at uncovering and preventing attacks directed or inspired by terrorist groups.</p> <p>Much of it remains undefined. Its challenge, say Clinton campaign advisers, is to match and thwart the way terrorism has transitioned from large-scale attacks directed by established terrorist groups to small-scale assaults by unconnected, self-radicalized perpetrators that are comparatively difficult to detect.</p> <p>Overseas, the Clinton campaign discusses the intelligence surge in terms of accelerating a focus on the Middle East.</p> <p>It seeks to expand intelligence sharing, particularly across European governments hindered by the lack of a continental intelligence infrastructure, concerning flows of jihadists, money and weapons.</p> <p> And it will support an intensified hunt for Baghdadi expending \u201csignificant resources\u201d, reminiscent of Barack Obama\u2019s successful push to find and kill al-Qaida leader Osama bin Laden.</p> <p>\u201cShe really would put a concerted focus on that, really going after him in particular,\u201d said Laura Rosenberger, a senior Clinton foreign policy adviser and former state department and National Security Council official. </p> <p>Domestically, the \u201cprinciples\u201d of Clinton\u2019s intelligence surge, according to senior campaign advisers, indicate a preference for targeted spying over bulk data collection, expanding local law enforcement\u2019s access to intelligence and enlisting tech companies to aid in thwarting extremism. </p> <p>The campaign speaks of \u201cbalancing acts\u201d between civil liberties and security, a departure from both <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2009/05/reject_false_choice_between_se_1.html\">liberal</a> and <a href=\"http://time.com/3851286/nsa-court-decision-rand-paul-patriot-act/\">conservative</a> arguments that tend to diminish conflict between the two priorities. Asked to illustrate what Clinton means by \u201cappropriate safeguards\u201d that need to apply to intelligence collection in the US, the campaign holds out a 2015 reform that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/apr/17/surveillance-reform-usa-freedom-act-nsa-civil-libertarians\">split</a> the civil liberties community as a model for any new constraints on intelligence authorities. </p> <p>The USA Freedom Act, a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/apr/23/usa-freedom-act-revised-senate-bill-nsa\">compromise</a> that constrained but did not entirely end bulk phone records collection, \u201cstrikes the right balance\u201d, Rosenberger said. \u201cSo those kinds of principles and protections offer something of a guideline for where any new proposals she put forth would be likely to fall.\u201d</p> <p>Many aspects of the intelligence surge, with major implications for the privacy-security debate, remain unsettled and subject to internal discussion. Among them is a thorny issue arising out of the recent waves of domestic attacks.</p> <p>Both the Orlando nightclub gunman and the accused New York-New Jersey bomber had initially come under FBI scrutiny. Both assessments ultimately <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jun/13/omar-mateen-fbi-boston-marathon-tsarnaev\">stopped</a> for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/20/ahmad-khan-rahami-father-fbi-terrorism-bombing\">lack of evidence of imminent action</a>. </p> <p>Now, Clinton and her advisers are studying whether and how law enforcement agencies ought to balance the privacy and security questions which arise: should agencies share information with each other on those preliminarily under terrorism suspicion, while attempting to avoid keeping such people under permanent investigation or alienating Muslim and other communities. </p> <p>The campaign said Clinton, who discussed the issue with her counter-terrorism advisers this week, has yet to reach any conclusions.</p> <p>Clinton\u2019s campaign is also examining expanding or reforming intelligence so-called fusion centers which gather, share and analyze information between federal, state and local law enforcement, which have been long criticized as both <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/dec/10/data-sharing-law-enforcement-organised-chaos\">ineffective</a> and <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/2012/10/fusion-centers/\">dangerous to privacy</a>. </p> <p>On encryption, Clinton wants Silicon Valley to move beyond its post-Snowden suspicion of US intelligence \u2013 a move dealt a big setback by the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/feb/17/inside-the-fbis-encryption-battle-with-apple\">FBI\u2019s abandoned fight with Apple </a>\u2013 but she does not yet have a plan for doing so beyond consistent nonadversarial engagement. </p> <p>More fundamentally, the Clinton campaign has yet to decide whether the intelligence surge includes or prioritizes adding spies, collecting more data, analyzing more data, expanding legal authorities or giving more money to the approximately $67bn intelligence apparatus. Advisers say those decisions will await the transition team should Clinton win the presidency. </p> <p>The campaign did not identify the architects of the intelligence surge, but it pointed to prominent counter-terrorism advisers who have been contributing ideas. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"032ad1fa65974f7d644048c5ecc1a0230ed6f8d8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/032ad1fa65974f7d644048c5ecc1a0230ed6f8d8/0_300_4500_2700/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Clinton national security team\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Hillary Clinton begins a working session with national security advisers and experts at the New York Historical Society.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Brendan Smialowski/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>They include former acting CIA director Michael Morell \u2013 who has come under recent criticism for his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/11/cia-torture-report-aftermath-daniel-jones-senate-investigation\">attacks on the Senate torture report</a> \u2013 ex-National Counterterrorism Center director Matt Olsen; Clinton\u2019s state department counter-terrorism chief Dan Benjamin; former National Security Council legal adviser Mary DeRosa; ex-acting Homeland Security secretary Rand Beers; Mike Vickers, a retired CIA operative who became Pentagon undersecretary for intelligence; and Jeremy Bash, Leon Panetta\u2019s chief of staff at the CIA and Pentagon. </p> <p>\u201cThey\u2019re all involved in the conversation,\u201d Rosenberger said. </p> <p>Pat Eddington, an intelligence aide to former US representative Rush Holt, said Clinton\u2019s intelligence surge sounded like a set of marginal adjustments to a US counter-terrorism apparatus in need of vast structural overhaul. </p> <p>\u201cIn essence, they want to do more of the same and tweak it around edges instead of taking a step back and asking: \u2018What are you getting for your money and can we be doing things ultimately differently and better?,\u2019\u201d said Eddington, now a civil liberties and national security analyst at the Cato Institute. </p> <p>Karen Greenberg, the director of Fordham Law School\u2019s Center on National Security, called an expanded emphasis on intelligence sharing in the age of small-scale terrorism inspired \u201ca logical evolution\u201d, and said that Clinton\u2019s approach seemed to be to avoid \u201coverreacting\u201d to threats. </p> <p>\u201cPushing the surveillance issue off to a future time is the elephant in the room,\u201d Greenberg said.</p> <p>Malcolm Nance, a former counterterrorism intelligence author and author of \u201c<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Defeating-ISIS-They-Fight-Believe-ebook/dp/B01BUE8AJM\">Defeating Isis</a>\u201d, approved of the intelligence surge\u2019s broad outlines, anticipating a forthcoming phase of the US war against Isis that will be more shadowy than the daily bombardment in Iraq, Syria and Libya.</p> <p>\u201cThe most critical thing to remember is in the next year Isis\u2019s caliphate will most likely collapse. They will transition from my physical state into what I call a ghost caliphate. The ideology will go underground and be spread almost exclusively through the Internet,\u201d Nance said. </p> <p>Beyond the hunt for Baghdadi \u2013 who already has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/27/inside-the-hunt-for-isis-leader-abu-bakr-al-baghdadi\">survived one US attempt on his life</a> \u2013 the campaign indicated rapid transitions in terrorist patterns would inform the shape of its intelligence surge.</p> <p> \u201cThe post-9/11 architecture was designed largely for identifying complex plots. We\u2019re in a different world now, where the lone wolf attackers may not even be directed by or coordinated with a terrorist group, they may simply be inspired by them. We need to adapt for that reality, while still not taking our eye off the ball of identifying potential complex attacks,\u201d Rosenberger said. </p>",

Yet I can\u2019t even imagine who is caring \u2013 what human heart beats inside this paper trash. I think I am supposed to care about these things, and so the salesmen parrot what they suppose would be my aspirations.</p> <p>Has any free people ever been so shouted at by caring fools and salesmen? Under the guise of useful knowledge, forces that frankly mean us no good, which range in mood between hysterical enthusiasm, indifference and careless exploitation, warn us with \u201chealth\u201d advice that is variously incoherent, short-sighted (to be reversed or falsified five years later) and banal. You can tell people not to eat eggs, but a decade later you\u2019ll be telling people to eat eggs. It seems trivial, but it always costs something \u2013 in worry and stupefaction, and in hours of our lives.</p> <p>You could say that this advice all comes in bad faith. But the voices which approach us in good faith may be even more to blame.</p> <p>Health, exercise, food, sex have become central preoccupations of our time. We preserve the living corpse in an optimal state, not so we may do something with it, but for the feeling of optimisation. More and more of life gets turned over to life maintenance at the very moment you\u2019d think we\u2019d be free to pursue something else.</p> <p>I find it hard not to want to live longer. I also want to live without pain. This means I want health. But when I place myself at a point within the vast constellation of health knowledge and health behaviours, I can\u2019t help but detect some misunderstanding. The systems of health have little to do with my simple ambitions. There is something too much, or too many, in them; too arbitrary, or too controlling; too doom-laden, too managerial, too messianic.</p> <p>We should spare a thought for the fate of what used to be called the \u201cnecessities of life\u201d. Necessity dictates what must be done for the body before anything can be done for the mind. For millennia, people have known what the necessities of life are. Food, shelter and clothes, made or won by labour. Sex and reproduction, tied to the labour of childbirth and work of child rearing. Sleep. (Alexander the Great said that sleep and sexual intercourse, more than anything else, reminded him that he was mortal). Movement, as has only come into focus since we began to sit for so much of our days. Touch, perhaps, as has become more obvious as the world became less tactile and rough, more screened and smoothed. Excretion.</p> <p>But 3,000 years of civilisation have worked to make these necessities easy to come by. In the last three centuries, human progress has pacified necessity in the rich countries. Back-breaking labour has been reduced. Food is inexpensive and superabundant. Sexual desire has been decoupled from pregnancy. The dangers of infection, fever and accident have been diminished by medicine, and medical research seeks ways to head off more slow-growing diseases. For many, simply to be born in a rich nation is to have won the lottery for inexpensive access to the necessities of life; to be gloriously, unprecedentedly free from cares historically and in comparison to much of the globe. There is freedom to enjoy \u2013 and there are wealth and material freedom to spread to others. For progressive civilisation had always expected that meeting necessity in the west was a mere prerequisite to further, higher goals: justice, equality, democracy, and the extension of ease of access to the necessities of life to all.</p> <p>But we have taken an unexpected detour on the way to meeting those higher goals. Once progress had made it easy to acquire the necessities of life, other forces set about making those needs mentally complicated and hard. Into this category goes much of what passes for wisdom about health, exercise, food and sex. Inexpensive things have become expensive, trivial matters require obsessive thought, universal biology is mazed with fashion and status-seeking, and free possessions are commoditised. If I feel sure of one thing, it is that this kind of \u201chealth\u201d imperative is not moral. It is grooming \u2013 what monkeys do in picking nits out of their fur. We may find that grooming sits among the subordinate necessities of life. But surely the ceaseless grooming and optimisation of everyday life stands in the way of finding out how else we could spend our attention and our energy.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b8ea09b09b31fc8fa5ef124b869dd874cb8bd294\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b8ea09b09b31fc8fa5ef124b869dd874cb8bd294/235_339_3605_2163/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Slaves to the machine \u2026 exercise junkies strive to build muscles that only get used in the gym\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Slaves to the machine \u2026 exercise junkies build muscles that only get used in the gym.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Uwe Kraft/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>A decade ago I wrote an essay titled \u201c<a href=\"https://nplusonemag.com/issue-1/essays/against-exercise/\">Against Exercise</a>\u201d. It came about from a trip to the gym to run on a treadmill. I was standing in the usual stance of mutual disregard, pretending not to notice my neighbours sweating through skintight pyjamas and making their angry \u2013 or, I suppose, fierce \u2013 faces. I tried not to look up when someone grunted or shouted, and kept my eyes politely on the calories ticking by on my readout, just as in a lift I\u2019d keep my eyes on the floor numbers.</p> <p>But then I breached convention and looked around, and was struck down by the sort of vision that must have come to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2014/nov/21/the-10-best-works-by-william-blake\">William Blake</a>, a glance into heaven and hell, suddenly manifest in his garden in Felpham. There was a young man crucified on a lat pull-down. There was a young woman whose legs were madly turned by a spinning bike. No one looked happy: they either looked like executioners, grim as death, or victims. Certainly no one looked sociable \u2013 though this might be the space with the most people, together, supposedly at ease and enjoying leisure time, that they would enter all day. I turned from one unseeing face to the next, each chasing some number, and I said: \u201cYou are condemned. You are condemned. You are condemned.\u201d I, too, was condemned. I got down from the treadmill.</p> <p>This, of course, had nothing to do with an intelligible argument. So when I got home, I began to try to figure out why we go to the gym. There are explicit rationales, and the precise words and phrases which recur in official injunctions to exercise. Then there are the quiet things people say in passing, about the pleasures and the ghastlinesses of it all. Modern exercise has a background in sport, even in the ancient gymnasia \u2013 but it is really quite different. It certainly seemed striking that, as advanced societies have done away with much industrial labour, and have automobilised transport, the new immaterial labourer spends his leisure mimicking the old repetitive gestures of the die press, or a stevedore\u2019s lifting of cargo, or a rural traveller\u2019s walk to a distant town, but turned into spectacle, sped-up, numbered, and producing muscles that serve no practical use but more of the same mimicry. And that this is so often experienced as obligation, rather than play.Then, I began to read and write about diet and food. Certainly we are in a golden intellectual age of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/food-blog/10-things-need-to-know-global-food-system\">political critiques of industrial food production</a>. The pollution and cruelty of factory farms have come into public view. The dangers of pesticides and groundwater contamination lie behind the progress of organic farming. But alongside the public-spirited motives for a return to heirloom products, artisanal production and farm-to-table eating, there seems to be another push towards rarity, social distinction and hostility to the cheap mass provision of food as a fundamental civilised achievement.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/aug/18/paleo-diet-critics-science\">What Paleo diet experts think \u2013 and why they're wrong</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Most ambiguous, to me, is the new figure of the foodie. Only in a culture cut off from agriculture and need can food become a hobby and grounds for individual identity. The old gourmet was a bit of a snob: he wed himself to France or Italy, learned to cook a single cuisine and became obsessed with importing, usually wine and cheese.</p> <p>The foodie differs in having the whole globe at his fingertips. His cookbooks gravitate first to Europe (Provence; southern Italy), then quickly carry him to Turkey, Morocco, Vietnam, India. No single tradition exists for him to learn, no singular importers to patronise. Rather, an ocean of ingredients washes up on his shores. There is no food we can\u2019t access. There is no traditional food, moreover, that can\u2019t be further enchanted by our concentration, restriction, choice, and discrimination between better and worse specimens. Would you like some chipotle with your lemongrass? We add the value of our intellectual labour, our \u201cfinishing\u201d of the world\u2019s raw materials.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"914dcf125fb3a27425216021b46080e69138a106\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/914dcf125fb3a27425216021b46080e69138a106/1867_314_1851_1111/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018The modern foodie has the whole globe at his fingertips.

He swims in possibility.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Eve O'Sullivan/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The foodie wades out and swims in possibility. And then, surprisingly, many a foodie will deliberately restrict his range. He sets rules or laws for himself that make the quest for food harder and the thinking more complex. Undiscovered foods only; \u201cauthentic\u201d restaurants only, or kitsch diners or barbecue joints; organic food only; local or farmers\u2019 market food, raw food or <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/nov/29/slow-food-story-goeff-andrews\">slow food</a> only. Foodieism is a natural hobby for first-world professionals, ostensibly showing an interest in the world, but referring back to domination and the perfection of the enriched, physical self.</p> <p>Having our food supply made simple, we devote ourselves to looking for ways to make it difficult. Another route is through dieting, ostensibly for health. Here, though, the weight-loss imperative, with its shadows of attractiveness and social distinction, and other fantasies of rarity, difficulty and expense, complicate the fairly mundane research consensus on improving health: eat moderately, move more. You can avoid bread, eat only protein and fat, and lose weight \u2013 since too much weight is said to be a killer. But as you polish off your bacon, steak and cheese, nothing has falsified the old research that correlates animal fats with plaque-filled arteries, heart disease, stroke and cancers.</p> <p>You can rediscover your inner ape and revert to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/aug/18/paleo-diet-critics-science\">a \u201cPaleolithic diet\u201d with evolutionary justifications</a>. But no 21st-century butcher can provide you the animals eaten by our Paleolithic ancestors. You will not eat it in the conditions of scarcity of our Paleolithic ancestors. None of the rest of your life, upbringing, habits or ingested substances resemble those of our Paleolithic ancestors. You might equally ground your fantasies of historical destiny in the fact that the entire history of human culture and civilisation has occurred in the Neolithic era \u2013 ie, facilitated by the planting of grain and domestication of animals. <em>Star Trek</em> fans would seem to have a better grasp of the scientific method.</p> <p>Then sex and sexuality began to interest me. We\u2019ve had a remarkable sexual liberation \u2013 particularly since the 1960s. Major achievements have included the end of shame and illegality in sex outside of marriage, the feminist reorganisation of intercourse around the female orgasm as well as the male; the destigmatisation of homosexuality, and a new fluidity to the norms of gender identity. The underlying impetus in all these reforms was to remove social penalties for doing what people were doing anyway.</p> <p>But competing with true liberation has been sexual liberalisation \u2013 an effort to tell you that only expertise, exposure, advice and apparatus can let you enjoy, in the right way, what was already freely possessed by you. A true test of liberation, as distinct from liberalisation, is whether you have also been freed to be free from sex. To ignore it, or to be asexual, without consequent social opprobrium or imputation of deficiency. We ought to see social categories of asexuals, who are free to have no sex just as others are free to have endless spectacular sex, and not feel towards them either suspicion or pity. One of the cruel betrayals of sexual liberation is the illusion that a person can be free only if he holds sex as all-important and exposes it endlessly to others \u2013 providing it, proving it, enjoying it.</p> <p>I think sometimes of a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ftvh9eWkAc\">John Prine song</a>: \u201cWe are living in the future, I\u2019ll tell you how I know / I read it in the paper, 15 years ago.\u201d We often speak about a coming age. In that near future, we\u2019ll enjoy heavenly ease and wellbeing, safety and leisure. How wonderful it will be! In fact, I think we ought to admit that many of us in the rich nations are already living in that future, and have been for some decades.</p> <p>But our surprising response to our times has been the creation of new forms of pseudonecessity. We go to the gym to strain at imitations of hard labour, lifting nonexistent roofbeams, hoeing nonexistent fields. We pretend that our food \u2013 now safe, plentiful, cheap, delicious \u2013 matters so much to our bodies that we must perfect it, elaborating a new necessity of pollution and taboo for heritage grains and laborious artisanal manufacture. We refuse to recognise that an 80-year lifespan of activities and projects is functional immortality for the human animal. Or that dying is necessary, just to let new people come on to the earth. So we substitute life-preservation for living, spending invaluable portions of youth and middle age on trying to increase our odds for an extra one, two or five years at the very end.</p> <p>Frankly, I suspect that an ethics of living in a rich nation at the dawn of the 21st century involves not caring so much about your health, your diet, your exercise and your thrills. The meaningful time is now. We should be prepared to enjoy our good luck, and drop dead after a sufficient length of time \u2013 but ask, along the way, what we actually wish to do with our time. A culture of health and futurity, right now, represents a terrified or intimidated flight from moral freedom \u2013 covering our eyes from the fact that we have no further urgent tasks of bodily improvement, and really need to choose between setting new social goals, or just grooming ourselves into eternity.</p> <p>\u2022 <em>Against Everything</em> by Mark Greif, published by Verso, is available for \u00a313.93 (RRP \u00a316.99) from <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/against-everything.html?utm_source=editoriallink&amp;utm_medium=merch&amp;utm_campaign=article\">bookshop.theguardian.com</a> or call 0330 333 6846.

Jeremiah Grossman, head of security strategy at infosec firm SentinelOne, said: \u201cWhile we know the information was stolen in late 2014, we don\u2019t have any indication as to when Yahoo first learned about this breach. This is an important detail in the story.\u201d</p> <p>Grossman, who ran information security for Yahoo\u2019s engineering department until 2001, added that the company\u2019s claims that the attacker was \u201cstate-sponsored\u201d also need additional scrutiny. \u201cState-sponsored adversaries don\u2019t typically publicly share stolen data or sell it, like profiteer hacker \u2018Peace of Mind\u2019.

And if so, this means it\u2019s possible we\u2019re looking at two different Yahoo breaches with two different hacking groups in their system.\u201d</p> <p>Chris Hodson, EMEA chief information security officer at enterprise security firm Zscaler, agrees. \u201cWith no technical details included in Yahoo\u2019s report about how the data was exfiltrated, just that it was, it\u2019s impossible to assess credibility of the \u2018state sponsored\u2019 claim.</p> <p>\u201cIt might well be that Yahoo has had support from government departments and that attribution has been possible but equally, \u2018state-sponsored\u2019 is often prefixed to \u2018actor\u2019 in an effort to suggest sophisticated and surreptitious means of data exfiltration. We simply do not know.\u201d</p> <p>Equally unclear is the extent to which passwords were protected. Yahoo has confirmed the passwords were hashed, a one-way transformation which allows the site to check that an entered password is correct without needing to store the actual password.</p> <p>The company added that \u201cthe vast majority\u201d were hashed with bcrypt, a particularly secure method which incorporates a \u201csalt\u201d ensuring that two identical passwords still have different entries in the database. That\u2019s important for protecting the hundreds of thousands of users who will all have picked \u201cpassword\u201d as a password, since it ensures that they don\u2019t all stand out \u2013 but it\u2019s unclear whether the minority of users whose passwords weren\u2019t hashed in this way have similar protections.</p> <p>The breach also highlights a strong problem with \u201csecurity questions\u201d, the common practice of letting users reset passwords by answering questions about their first house or mother\u2019s maiden name. Yahoo did not encrypt all the security questions it stored, and so some are readable in plaintext. While it may be irritating to have to change a stolen password, it is somewhat worse to have to change a stolen mother\u2019s maiden name.</p> <p>One other question raised by the breach is also unanswered: what happens to the company\u2019s multi-billion dollar merger with Verizon now? Kevin Cunningham, president and founder at identity company SailPoint, argues that the breach should already be priced in \u2013 but only if Verizon\u2019s due diligence was thorough enough. \u201cMergers are complicated endeavors, and the scrutiny under which both companies will reside during the course of the transaction only increases the stress to keep what should be sensitive information protected. Verizon certainly took on a calculated level of risk in acquiring Yahoo!, particularly because of its massive user base.</p> <p>\u201cThe question of whether this breach will affect the sale price depends on how extensively it performed due diligence on Yahoo\u2019s security controls. It\u2019s a perfect illustration of the fact that this due diligence should include not just network security controls, but also identity governance controls, because as we\u2019ve seen with LinkedIn, Dropbox and countless others, breaches very often result from compromised employee credentials.\u201d</p> <p>For users with Yahoo accounts, though, many of these questions are moot. The advice remains the same either way: they need to change their Yahoo password and security questions as soon as possible, and also change the password anywhere else they may have re-used that information. Ideally, they should stop re-using passwords altogether.</p> <p>Since Yahoo is a major webmail provider, there\u2019s one extra problem: any further service which has password reset emails sent to a Yahoo Mail account should also be considered compromised, and passwords accordingly changed.</p>",
  "<p>Putting together an effective school governing body isn\u2019t easy. Not only are school governors unpaid \u2013 and, perhaps unsurprisingly, hard to recruit \u2013 but boards are responsible for a huge variety of tasks. They appoint headteachers, examine how money is being spent and scrutinise the progress that students make.</p> <p>If a board is going to work effectively, it needs governors who are comfortable with all kinds of tasks: from sifting through hefty policy reports and picking apart data to communicating with parents. <br></p> <p>No one person will be able to do all of these things, but it is important that a board has a range of expertise among its governors, says Mark Gardner, public relations officer at the <a href=\"http://www.nga.org.uk/Home.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\">National Governors Association</a>. </p> <p>\u201cBuilding a successful governing body, like any other team, is about achieving balance and diversity in skills and experience,\u201d he says. \u201cThe governors also need to work together as part of a team.\u201d</p> <p>So which skills are essential for a well-functioning governing body? And how can boards help their governors to develop further? Here are six key areas:</p> <h2>1 Financial and legal understanding</h2> <p>\u201cFinance is the big thing at the moment,\u201d says Oliver Kean, senior researcher at <a href=\"https://schoolgovernors.thekeysupport.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Key</a>. \u201cAs more schools become academies, the importance of having proper financial checks on the governing body increases.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/teacher-network/2016/sep/08/debate-should-schools-send-pupils-home-for-wearing-the-wrong-uniform\">Debate: should schools send pupils home for wearing the wrong uniform?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Legal skills are also important. \u201cIncreasingly schools are having to be much more aware of legal issues,\u201d says Kean. \u201cAs academies grow they\u2019re much more individually liable should they be challenged.\u201d However, he also issues a warning: \u201cGovernors who are legal experts need to keep a sensible amount of distance, as schools will have their own legal teams.\u201d</p> <p><strong>How to get it:</strong> If you have one person on the board who is a financial or legal expert, ask that person to help others, Kean advises. \u201cOne person can share their knowledge and experience with the other governors and that\u2019s a great way to train on a budget.\u201d</p> <h2>2 Clear communication</h2> <p>Good communication and creative skills are essential for a governing body \u2013 but this isn\u2019t always acknowledged, says Gardner. \u201cFor example, we need creative people with the ability to communicate complex ideas in a simple way.\u201d</p> <p>It also means having the ability to listen. \u201cGovernors need to listen to what\u2019s going on around them,\u201d says Janet Scott, chief executive of <a href=\"https://www.sgoss.org.uk/\" rel=\"nofollow\">School Governors One-Stop Shop</a>. \u201cYou don\u2019t want someone who thinks they\u2019re right all the time and doesn\u2019t listen to anyone else. You have to be able to empathise with the parents and the staff.\u201d </p> <p><strong>How to get it:</strong> Recruit people from a range of backgrounds. \u201cDiversity in all its forms is really important,\u201d says Kirsty Watt, head of <a href=\"https://www.academyambassadors.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Academy Ambassadors</a>. \u201cIf you have people around the table who all think alike, or who have been appointed through a non-competitive process, that\u2019s really dangerous. Boards should be ambitious and positive when recruiting, and have a proper role specification. The days of tapping someone on the back and asking them to join you are over.\u201d</p> <h2>3 Business savvy</h2> <p>In <a href=\"https://www.thekeysupport.com/about/media-press/surveys/skills-needed-school-governance/\" rel=\"nofollow\">a survey conducted by The Key this year</a>, school governors rated business management, along with finance and leadership, as one of the most desired skills for governing bodies.</p> <p>\u201cBusiness planning is important,\u201d says Kean. \u201cSchools are increasingly becoming independent charitable companies and need people on the governing body who can understand what a business plan looks like and how it might translate into a school world.\u201d As such, your board should have at least one person who has experience of looking at budgets in their day job, says Scott. </p> <p><strong>How to get it:</strong> Kean recommends asking an expert from your own school to give a training session. \u201cFor example, get a business manager to talk about business planning. This can be a cheap and basic way of spreading information about a part of school life that you might not otherwise hear about,\u201d he says. <br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/teacher-network/2016/jul/27/six-things-schools-must-know-before-joining-multi-academy-trust\">Joining a multi-academy trust? Ask these questions first</a> </p> </aside>  <h2>4 Data analysis </h2> <p>Governing boards need the ability to analyse and review different types of data, so having someone with a good grasp of statistics is key, says Gardner. \u201cThis is important because governors and trustees will receive a lot of information from a range a sources, presented in different ways over the years.\u201d</p> <p><strong>How to get it: </strong>Join together with other schools for training sessions. \u201cIf you can arrange a session from an independent trainer between a group of schools, that can be a very efficient way to get training,\u201d says Kean.</p> <h2>5 Passion for education</h2> <p>An interest in education is essential, says Nick Chambers, director of <a href=\"http://www.educationandemployers.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Education and Employers</a>. Having headteachers from other schools on your governing body can be really helpful, adds Kean. \u201cThen other governors can get a second opinion on the world of schools.\u201d </p> <p>Even if governors are not from an education background it\u2019s important that they spend time in the school and understand its culture, says Chambers. \u201cGovernors should get a sense of the ethos of the school and of events that it is running. Whether it be drama or a sports productions, they should get involved in the life of the school and show an interest and be aware of what\u2019s going on.\u201d</p> <p><strong>How to get it:</strong> Again, this is all about recruitment and skill-sharing across the board. \u201cThe emphasis is on building a team that has the essential skills, including education knowledge, when put together,\u201d says Gardner.</p> <h2>6 Enthusiasm and confidence</h2> <p>Most importantly, governors must be committed, says Chambers. \u201cSometimes people forget that this is absolutely key. You want confident governors who will hold people to account in a supportive way.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/teacher-network/2016/jun/22/eight-ways-school-governors-prepare-ofsted-inspection\">Eight ways school governors can prepare for an Ofsted inspection</a> </p> </aside>  <p>A good attitude can make all the difference. \u201cPeople with a willingness to take up a challenge and learn on the job make the best governors,\u201d agrees Kean. \u201cYou can\u2019t expect to turn up to meetings and perform well just from reading the papers you\u2019ve been sent. Governors need to read around what\u2019s happening policy-wise, both nationally and locally, and try and understand where the school fits into the wider picture. </p> <p><strong>How to get it: </strong>This doesn\u2019t necessarily come from a particular background or profession, but is about nurturing an interest, says Kean. Look for people with enthusiasm, curiosity, problem-solving skills and the ability to analyse when recruiting, he recommends.</p> <p><strong>Follow us on Twitter via <a href=\"https://twitter.com/GuardianTeach\" rel=\"nofollow\">@GuardianTeach</a>.

  "<p><strong>The first time I realised there was something going on musically in South Africa was 2008,</strong> when I went there to play with a Nigerian afrobeat band called <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/ayetorolive/\">Ayetoro</a>.

  "<p>The frathouse comedy is almost as much of an all-American institution as fraternities themselves. In 1978, <a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/animal-house-mistake-that-cost-donald-sutherland-millions-2014-3\">National Lampoon\u2019s Animal House</a> became one of the most profitable movies of all time and Hollywood realised that there was gold in them there locker rooms.

There was one aspect that was wearyingly traditional, however: the movies\u2019 depiction of women as little more than disposable objects to be fought over and won by the guys. But as the genre evolved, so did its sexual politics. Watching fraternity comedies over the past few decades we see a slow march towards gender equality and a deconstruction of the patriarchy both onscreen and off.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5c24e2f47f0e66a2007518839da9631c3234ff9d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5c24e2f47f0e66a2007518839da9631c3234ff9d/0_0_1750_1195/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Animal House: just lovable, sex-crazed guys doing battle with authority\" width=\"1000\" height=\"683\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Animal House: just lovable, sex-crazed guys doing battle with authority.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/Universal/Sportsphoto Ltd</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>On its release, the misogyny of Animal House seemed to pass critics by. In his <a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/national-lampoons-animal-house-1978\">four-star review</a>, Roger Ebert praised it as \u201can end run around Hollywood\u2019s traditional notions of comedy\u201d. He praised the fraternity\u2019s womanizing leader Otter (Tim Matheson) for achieving \u201ca kind of grace in his obsession\u201d. This is the womanizer who seduces the dean\u2019s wife to get even and, in one of the funniest sequences, poses as a dead girl\u2019s unwitting fiance in order to garner sympathy from the deceased\u2019s attractive roommate. </p> <p>More disturbing is the attitude displayed by Larry (Tom Hulce) towards a young, attractive cashier. He invites her to a party at the frathouse, where she promptly passes out topless in his room. A devil and angel appear on Larry\u2019s shoulders, as he grapples with the idea of raping her unconscious body. Eventually, he does the right thing, and seems proud of it. But later, he takes her out again. With both of them sober, they\u2019re about to have sex, when she reveals that she\u2019s only 13. The scene cuts away, but it is later revealed that Larry had sex with her anyway.</p> <p>What\u2019s particularly toxic about this scenario is that unlike Otter, Larry is one of the good guys. Larry is a virgin, and the fraternity \u2013 which Animal House holds up as an antidote to the oppressive establishment \u2013 turns him into a statutory rapist. At the time however, no one seemed notice. Even <a href=\"http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/race/pauline-kaels-editor-shed-laugh-74994\">Pauline Kael</a> celebrated the film, writing in her review: \u201cI stand with the slobs.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"eda1403f20fc9f5cfb946f0d15ee8b7285fb562a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/eda1403f20fc9f5cfb946f0d15ee8b7285fb562a/0_0_1848_1213/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jock stars: Ted McGinley and Julia Montgomery in Revenge of the Nerds.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"656\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jock stars: Ted McGinley and Julia Montgomery in Revenge of the Nerds.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Cine Text/Sportsphoto Ltd/Allstar</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Revenge of the Nerds, the next frat movie to hit big at the box office, is similarly icky. Like Animal House, it focuses on a crew of students rejected from the establishment fraternities who form their own frat and eventually do battle with the jocks. In Nerds, the heroes aren\u2019t dumb drunks, but their goal of abusing women to validate their own manhood remains the same. </p> <p>In the film\u2019s climactic scene, Lewis (Robert Carradine), the chief nerd, poses as a jock to have sex with his unwitting girlfriend. The law calls this rape, but the film simply sees it as a victory for the nerds. Meanwhile, his friends are across campus selling nude photos of her that they took without her consent in an effort to win a competition with the jocks. In these films, the characters are so concerned with their status in the eyes of other men that the treatment of their female peers is totally irrelevant.</p> <p>As times change, however, so do attitudes. Steve Zacharias, the writer of Revenge of the Nerds, expressed contrition about his work. \u201cThat was rape,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKvo42M_jjw\">he said</a>, referring to the climactic scene. \u201cIf I knew now what I knew then, I wouldn\u2019t have done that.\u201d He also apologized for the plotline involving stolen photographs, even connecting it to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/feb/29/broadcaster-erin-andrews-in-tears-as-she-testifies-in-nude-videos-lawsuit\">criminal spying of ESPN broadcaster Erin Andrews </a>that made national news over two decades later. \u201cA lot of times the media introduces terrible concepts ... that puts thoughts into people\u2019s minds,\u201d he said.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a44d3e0adb6ab0199ea02ffa8600daeb36da0945\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a44d3e0adb6ab0199ea02ffa8600daeb36da0945/0_0_5760_3840/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Neighbors 2: Sorority Rising criticises the fraternity from the inside out.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Neighbors 2: Sorority Rising criticises the fraternity from the inside out.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/Universal Pictures</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Over the years, the fraternity movie has popped up from time to time in its original form \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0302886/\">Old School </a>(2003) featured jokes about statutory rape and topless wrestling \u2013 but it also gave way to a new kind of fraternity movie that gave voice to characters and ideas that were previously marginalized. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2008/oct/10/comedy\">The House Bunny</a> (2008) was the first sorority movie not to use its female characters solely as titillation for a male audience. <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0775539/\">Stomp the Yard</a> (2007) was a rare instance of a film focusing on black fraternities, almost 20 years after <a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/school-daze-1988\">Spike Lee\u2019s School Daze</a> (1988).</p> <p>The fraternity movie has certainly changed with the times, but this year, the transformation came all at once. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/may/04/bad-neighbours-2-review-zac-efron-seth-rogen-film-sequel\">Bad Neighbors 2: Sorority Rising</a> and Goat, which opens in the US on Friday, criticize the fraternity system from the inside out. The original <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/may/02/bad-neighbours-review-zac-efron-seth-rogen\">Bad Neighbors</a> (2014) viewed fraternities sympathetically, but it offered a mild criticism. One of the film\u2019s most surprising scenes comes between Teddy (Zac Efron) and Pete (Dave Franco), college seniors and officers of the party-heavy frat. When Teddy confronts Pete about devoting more time to his studies and job interviews than partying, Pete makes clear that he doesn\u2019t buy into the mythology of brotherhood that has underpinned every fraternity movie in existence. \u201cYou know none of this matters, right?\u201d he tells him. </p> <p>This year\u2019s sequel, Bad Neighbors 2: Sorority Rising, goes even further to subvert the toxic masculinity of the genre. The film opens with Pete getting engaged to another man and sharing the moment with his former brothers. Teddy (Zac Efron), the alpha-male rush leader who once represented the social conservatism of the Reagan era, approves and is happy for his friend. These films were never explicitly homophobic \u2013 the villain of Animal House called his pledges \u201cfaggot\u201d, but the heroes never did \u2013 but an embrace of queerness within the fraternity system still stands as a bold embrace of progressive social mores.</p> <p>The film\u2019s real social victory is in its feminist qualities. One storyline follows Shelby (Chlo\u00eb Grace Moretz), a freshman who starts her own sorority when she learns that, by Greek rule, sororities are not allowed to host parties \u2013 which is true. Teddy even offers his help to mentor and tutor the young women, never once treating them as sexual objects. The film subverts genre tropes, and takes the opportunity to explore the sexism that is, the film argues, inherent in the Greek system.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ef1888bcbcaf0c68300277d42bdf6a365a31af66\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ef1888bcbcaf0c68300277d42bdf6a365a31af66/0_0_2048_1105/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Hazing horror: Ben Schnetzer and Nick Jonas in Goat.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"540\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Hazing horror: Ben Schnetzer and Nick Jonas in Goat.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Supplied</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Bad Neighbors 2 is optimistic that fraternities can change, but Goat offers nothing so rosy. The film, based on <a href=\"http://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/97455/goat-by-brad-land/9780399591426/\">a memoir by Brad Land</a>, depicts the brutal horrors of hazing at real-life fraternity Sigma Phi. It\u2019s a long way from Animal House, whose version of hazing was getting doused in beer or, at its worst, being paddled in a perverted but relatively innocuous ritual. Goat lifts the veil and shows that, while the fraternity movie itself may have evolved, activities at real-life fraternities have only gotten worse.</p> <p>The pledges in Goat are urinated on and made to sleep in cages. They are forced to drink far more excessively than anything we\u2019ve seen before in a frathouse film \u2013 and consume entire bottles of hot sauce. In the scene that gives the movie its title, a small group of pledges are instructed to drink an entire keg of beer \u2013 and if they fail, they will be forced to have sex with a goat. Shocking as these images are, the film would come across as ineffective moral scolding if it were not seen through the eyes of its protagonist, who is mercilessly beaten by a pair of strangers in the film\u2019s first scene, and spends the rest of the film \u2013 especially Hell Week, the hazing period covered in the film \u2013 trying to prove to himself and the world he\u2019s not a coward. </p> <p>In Goat, there is no overbearing dean or rival fraternity with whom the heroes do battle. The villains are the frat leaders themselves. Earlier films would have Brad break off and start another fraternity \u2013 a kindler, gentle one \u2013 but Goat keeps its sheep among the wolves, trapped in the institutionalized violence that have defined both fraternities and their cinematic representations since day one.</p> <p>Ultimately, fraternities have become a stand-in for the American establishment itself. In the late 2000s, as Americans were expressing their disappointment over the Bush presidency, movies like <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2007/feb/25/robertdeniro.mattdamon\">The Good Shepherd</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2008/nov/07/w-film-review\">Oliver Stone\u2019s W</a> equated the fraternity system \u2013 specifically, the real-life Skull and Bones secret society at Yale \u2013 with the political establishment. This year, with voters offscreen expressing new levels of antipathy towards that establishment, pop culture seems to be following suit. While the fraternity movie may never be completely upended, history shows that progress can sometimes be made from within.</p>",

The study finds it makes us much more likely to engage in selfless, altruistic behavior. We are also more likely to remember details of the interaction with the other person and to appraise that person more positively.</p> <p>So why don\u2019t we do it more often? Eye contact can be painful because it makes us profoundly vulnerable. After all, direct eye contact creates a moment when we are both very visible, but we also have minimal control over what the other sees. Being behind a screen is much safer. That\u2019s why many of us largely avoid eye contact by gazing at our phones \u2013 especially in awkward or intimate moments.</p> <p>We are used to hiding our feelings through careful curation of social media profiles and through various digital techniques of deferral and avoidance. When scrolling through our phones and feeds, we keep our minds busy and, perhaps superficially, keep in touch with others. But in those moments we are also largely devoid of self-awareness \u2013 and that, according to this latest research, is essential to making true contact with another person.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/may/29/posting-photos-online-obituary-images\">Posting photos online is not living.

Indeed, it is important to squeeze the most out of our personal interactions whenever possible \u2013 and that includes catching up with old friends online. But, thinking digital communication is enough to keep a relationship going is a fantasy. Interacting with friends online grants us greater control over the way they perceive us, and that can be reassuring. But if we retreat behind Snapchat videos, WhatsApp messages and Facebook posts, we lessen the possibility of an encounter that could teach us about one another and ourselves. </p> <p>The power of eye contact is intuitively obvious to most of us \u2013 any research describing the positive effects of eye contact is cleanly in line with common sense. We know we are more likely to pay attention to someone who seems to be paying attention to us. It is also no surprise that exchanging glances with someone makes us feel better about that person. </p> <p>The essence of the research, however, lies in revealing how self-reference \u2013 the kind of self-awareness that arises from direct eye contact \u2013 helps us when connecting with others. In order to connect more deeply, we must be seen in ways we cannot control, and an uncomfortable jolt of self-awareness in those first moments of eye contact may scare us away.<br></p> <p>Now that we know even more about the essential importance of a simple, unbroken gaze, we have even more reason to seek it out. Especially when meeting up with someone we care about, deep eye contact matters. And, if that feels uncomfortable that\u2019s OK.

  "<p>Theresa May has told senior commanders that every effort must be made to stop British soldiers from falling victim to \u201cabuse of the legal system\u201d by lawyers representing Iraqis who allege they were victims of war crimes during the occupation of their country. </p> <p>In a 90-minute meeting with senior commanders, the prime minister said she was determined to protect the armed forces against any \u201cvexatious complaints\u201d relating to the eight-year occupation, during which tens of thousands of British soldiers were deployed to the Arab republic. </p> <p>It comes amid mounting criticism of the Iraq Historic Allegations Team (Ihat), which was set up to investigate allegations of murder, abuse and torture by British forces. Former soldiers have claimed they have been hounded through the courts on unfounded claims and there are growing calls for Ihat to be shut down. </p> <p>Reports claim more than 1,200 cases of alleged abuse will be dismissed in the next three months after the collapse of a single law firm, Public Interest Lawyers, after <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/aug/15/public-interest-lawyers-iraq-war-al-sweady-theresa-may-uk-troops\">it was stripped of legal aid funding</a> over a failure to come clean about conflicting evidence in a case against British forces. </p> <p>A Downing Street statement said: \u201cThe prime minister spoke of her pride in the UK armed forces, and praised the work they do to keep our nation safe. She said that every effort must be made to prevent any abuse of the legal system, and restated her determination to protect the armed forces against any instances of vexatious complaints.\u201d</p> <p>But the Law Society, which represents lawyers, hit back, warning that political interference in the legal cases risked undermining \u201cthe independence of the legal profession, the rule of law, and the separation of powers which are fundamental to a strong and diverse society.\u201d</p> <p>Robert Bourns, president of the society, said: \u201cLawyers must not be hindered or intimidated in carrying out their professional duties and acting in the best interests of their clients within the law. They should not be identified with their clients or clients\u2019 cases.\u201d </p> <p>He added: \u201cThe right to access to justice for all depends on lawyers being able to represent their clients\u2019 cases within our framework of laws, no matter how the client or case may be perceived by the public, media or government.

Whether taking the fight to Daesh in Iraq and Syria, helping to tackle the migrant crisis in the Mediterranean or providing flood relief at home \u2013 we owe them a huge debt of gratitude.</p> <p>\u201cOur armed forces are the best in the world and with the biggest defence budget in Europe and the second biggest in Nato we will continue to play our part on the world stage, protecting UK interests across the globe.\u201d </p> <p>The Conservative MP Johnny Mercer, a member of the defence select committee, who is heading an investigation into Ihat, has branded the legal pursuit of troops \u201ca national disgrace\u201d and called for the team, which was set up in 2010, to be axed. This month, Mercer claimed that May\u2019s predecessor, David Cameron, had wanted to shut down the investigations, only to be overruled by the attorney general. </p> <p>The Birmingham-based Public Interest Lawyers had submitted hundreds of allegations of misconduct and unlawful killing by British soldiers, including triggering the \u00a331m <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/al-sweady-inquiry\">Al-Sweady inquiry</a> into the conduct of British troops in a 2004 firefight with insurgents. </p> <p>However, it was subsequently accused of sitting on evidence that undermined its clients\u2019 claims in that case for a year, before withdrawing their claim.

  "<p>In a rare show of international unity, more than 30 countries this week <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/sep/21/paris-climate-agreement-poised-to-come-into-force\">declared their plans</a> to translate into national laws the Paris agreement on climate change.</p> <p>As a result, by the end of this year, or soon after, the accord should come into effect and become binding under international law.</p> <p>This is a major step. It will be the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/mar/11/kyoto-protocol\">first time since 1992</a> that a global agreement on climate change has been internationally accepted (the Kyoto protocol, signed by the White House in 1997, was famously stymied by the refusal of the US Congress to ratify it), and the first time in history that rich and poor countries have faced the same obligations to tackle global warming.</p> <p>Ratification may seem a small step, given that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/dec/13/paris-climate-deal-cop-diplomacy-developing-united-nations\">the agreement was passed by every one of the 195 United Nations member states last December</a>. But it is important because it gives full legal standing to the document. That makes it harder for any government to row back on the Paris commitments.</p> <p>The most obvious potentially recalcitrant nation is the US, the world\u2019s second biggest emitter of greenhouse gases, where the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/may/26/donald-trump-environmental-policy-climate-change-keystone-xl\">presidential contender Donald Trump has vowed to unpick the agreement if elected this November</a>. But other countries are also in danger of reneging. Russia was always a reluctant member, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/dec/13/climate-change-paris-deal-cop21-obama-administration-congress-republicans-environment\">Nicaragua showed signs of trying to stop the agreement while the ink was still wet</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2015/dec/12/what-does-paris-climate-agreement-mean-for-australia\">Australia\u2019s volatile politics on climate change could yet cause a U-turn on the part of its government.</a></p> <p>Paris will enter into force if 55 countries, and enough countries to account for 55% of global emissions, ratify its contents. The former target will be met if the nations that have publicly agreed to ratify now do so, and the latter will soon be met if the EU, as promised, takes on its responsibilities in a bloc-wide agreement, expected early next year.</p> <p>It is also important to recall the history of climate change treaties. The failure of the US to ratify, despite presidential approval, and Russia\u2019s plodding acceptance, meant that the 1997 Kyoto protocol <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2005/feb/16/sciencenews.environment\">only became legal in 2005</a>. By then it was largely academic, as the world had moved on to begin negotiations on a new global settlement on climate change. The world had also moved on in terms of emissions, as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/sep/03/paris-climate-deal-where-us-and-china-have-led-others-must-quickly-follow\">China</a> was confirmed as the world\u2019s second biggest emitter \u2013 and is now the biggest.</p> <p>Kyoto placed quantified commitments on all developed countries to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions. Paris does not. Although nearly all of the world\u2019s countries \u2013 including the biggest emitters, developed and developing \u2013 <a href=\"http://www4.unfccc.int/submissions/indc/Submission%20Pages/submissions.aspx\">submitted plans before the Paris conference to cut or curb their emissions</a>, those plans are not legally binding and will not be even when the accord enters into force. </p> <p>The only legally binding commitment is to limit global warming to no more than 2C above pre-industrial levels, with an additional \u201caspiration\u201d to take even more drastic action to limit warming to 1.5C, which if adhered to could save the world\u2019s low-lying islands from inundation.</p> <p>Quantified emissions curbs up to 2020 \u2013 not legally binding but set out publicly \u2013 were also agreed in 2009, at the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/copenhagen\">much-derided Copenhagen conference on climate change</a>, and those commitments still stand. </p> <p>More importantly, the geopolitical landscape has been transformed in the 20-plus years in which the world has been discussing a global response to climate change. China, which carried no obligations under Kyoto, is now the world\u2019s biggest emitter and soon to be the biggest economy. Developing nations are also now the biggest sources of the stock of carbon in the atmosphere, outpacing the richer countries responsible for \u201chistoric\u201d emissions before the 1990s.</p> <p>What should we take from the Paris pact? First, recognise the limitations of what can be considered legally binding under international law. While nations were willing to agree to limit global warming, they were not willing to take on binding targets on reducing emissions, of the kind that were stipulated at Kyoto. It is now clear, after more than 20 years of international negotiations, and a changing pattern of which nations contribute most to the stock of carbon dioxide that is warming the planet, that even supposedly binding agreements do not guarantee reductions in emissions.</p> <p>That depends on countries delivering on their pledges to curb carbon production, which in turn depends on their internal politics. No international treaty, legally binding or not, can force countries to limit emissions if they are not willing to do so.</p> <p>So, although the Paris agreement is an important step, it will not be enough to guarantee that warming will not exceed scientific advice. Following through on the goal of limiting climate change will require much more: a reversal of the current reliance on fossil fuels in favour of low-carbon forms of energy production; businesses to alter their practices so that their activities produce less carbon; individuals to alter their behaviour; and finding ways to cope with a growing population of people who, rightly, wish to enjoy the fruits of modern prosperity without destroying the aspirations of their children to do the same.</p> <p>The Paris agreement acknowledged that climate change is a global problem that will require concerted global action. It is not, in itself, a solution to that problem. But it provides a way forward that can be built into a solution. If we want it.</p>",

The fact that ivory policy is being driven by the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/sep/22/prince-william-african-elephants-could-be-gone-from-the-wild-by-the-time-charlotte-turns-25\">British royal family</a> and well-heeled American lobbyists does not make it right.

  "<h2>NYC FC can make history on Star Wars night in the Bronx</h2> <p>In 2002, the New York Yankees outbid the Boston Red Sox for star Cuban pitcher Jose Contreras, forcing Red Sox president Larry Lucchino (who retired last year) to vent his frustration. \u201cThe evil empire extends its tentacles even into Latin America,\u201d he told the New York Times, and from that precise moment the Yankees had a new nickname. How fitting then, that 14 years later the evil empire could see their soccer club clinch their first ever playoff spot on Star Wars night in the Bronx tonight.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/13/mls-canada-american-citizens\">'We're second-class citizens': why MLS in Canada benefits everyone except Canada</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Patrick Vieira\u2019s men face last-placed Chicago Fire and a victory, though satisfactory, is not enough in order to secure a place in the postseason. NYC FC will clinch a berth with a win and either a New England tie or loss against Columbus or an Orlando City draw with DC United. The last choice, for obvious reasons, would be a Red Bulls victory over Montreal Impact, as I\u2019m sure the last thing NYC FC want to hear is a playoff spot was awarded partly in thanks to their bitter rivals.</p> <p>\u201cWe put ourselves in a good position so far this year. We\u2019ve got four games left and we need to treat each game separately, on its own, as a final,\u201d <a href=\"http://www.nycfc.com/post/2016/09/21/new-york-city-fc-vs-chicago-fire-match-preview-92316\">said midfielder Tommy McNamara.</a> \u201cWe need to finish out the year strong and make sure that we do get into the playoffs in the highest position as possible. We need to be ready, we need to be prepared, we need to be willing to fight for all the points that are available.\u201d</p> <p>They\u2019ll have to do it without Frank Lampard, who is out for three to four weeks with another calf injury. There\u2019s plenty to work with, however, and Vieira has hinted at the fact that Stiven Mendoza, McNamara or Jack Harrison could fill Lampard\u2019s central role. \u201c\u201cI feel comfortable anywhere in any attacking position,\u201d said McNamara <a href=\"http://www.mlssoccer.com/post/2016/09/20/vieira-weighing-midfield-options-frank-lampards-latest-injury-absence\">earlier this week</a>. \u201cIf [Vieira] and the coaching staff decide it\u2019s best for me to play in that spot, then I\u2019m prepared and willing to do so and would be excited about it. But we have a couple of different options, and it\u2019s up to him and the coaching staff to do what they feel is best for the team.\u201d</p> <p>As for Chicago? Mathematically speaking, they are still in the running as they are only six points away from sixth place (with two games in hand), but given the fact that they only have one away win all season \u2013 3-0 against Montreal last month \u2013 and their next three matches are on the road, I\u2019m not too optimistic for the Fire faithful. <strong>LME</strong></p> <h2>Orlando City vs DC United could be the match of the season<br></h2> <p>When it comes to sports, the importance of success partly relies with momentum and the ability to heat up at the right moment. Take for instance, last year\u2019s champions, the Portland Timbers. It was this week, two days ago, when they lost 2-0 to the New York Red Bulls and were clinging to the last playoff spot on a single point in the west by the skin of their teeth. Suddenly, they woke up and Caleb Porter\u2019s men went on to win four from the last five matches \u2013 including a 5-2 demolition of LA Galaxy \u2013 propelling them to third place in the table. The rest, as they say, is history and the Timbers rewarded Portland their first sports championship since the Trail Blazers won the 1977 NBA championship.</p> <p>DC United and Orlando City \u2013 teams with an identical record (7-13-9) and only separated by goal difference \u2013 are using this storyline for inspiration. Currently sitting in seventh and eighth spot, these eastern conference rivals cannot afford to lose any points, so this match will probably have the feel of a playoff match. This is actually the first time they are meeting this season so the fact that we are not really sure what to expect adds another level of tension as they look to catch up to New England, who currently occupies sixth place.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2665e878b21ee11e9640503e90e27d8bd459a17e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2665e878b21ee11e9640503e90e27d8bd459a17e/0_270_4634_2891/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Orlando have an identical record to Orlando City.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"624\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Orlando have an identical record to Orlando City.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kim Klement/USA Today Sports</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cOne positive result and confidence will give us momentum,\u201d said <a href=\"http://www.mlssoccer.com/post/2016/09/21/orlando-city-believe-they-can-be-next-team-heat-long-playoff-run\">Orlando\u2019s Servando Carrasco.</a> \u201cYou look at our game against [Sporting] KC last year, when we won 3-1, and then it was 1-0 at Chicago, which was massive, and then we went to New York [Red Bulls] and had possibly our best game [winning 5-2], so it\u2019s just a matter of getting that confidence.\u201d</p> <p>Carrasco believes that this confidence is the last piece of the puzzle that will help his team climb up the table. \u201cOnce you get it, you have to try to sustain it. One thing I have noticed in the past six seasons is that it\u2019s not necessarily the best team [that wins MLS Cup] but the team that peaks at the ideal time.\u201d</p> <p>DC United agrees, wholeheartedly \u2013 they\u2019re just hoping that it goes in their favor. <strong>LME</strong></p> <h2>Sporting and San Jose look to oust the other from postseason play</h2> <p>It\u2019s going to go to the wire, isn\u2019t it? The top four in the West look well set for the postseason, but five teams \u2013 Portland, Sporting, Seattle, Vancouver and San Jose \u2013are still in the hunt for the final two spots, and three will have to go home early. Only Houston look likely to miss out \u2013 but even that\u2019s not mathematically certain.</p> <p>So how will things shake down? San Jose v Sporting on Saturday, the first of two huge clashes between the pair, could go some way to determining who makes it, and who goes on vacation early. Sporting could have made their life much easier last week had they held on to the lead against LA, but of course, Landon Donovan had to spoil everything by getting a (re)debut goal and allowing his team to escape with a point they barely deserved.</p> <p>Peter Vermes\u2019 post-match comments betrayed a coach who knew his side had let one slip: \u201cIt\u2019s disappointing, for sure. Especially with the way we controlled the game. We owned it. We go up 2-1 and it hurts to give up those points when there was not that much time left. You have to be able to close the game out at home. To climb back like we did is great, but to allow them to come back was sad.\u201d</p> <p>Two wins and a draw from their final four games might be enough for Sporting to hold off Seattle and San Jose, but it\u2019s imperative for them not to lose at Avaya Stadium on Saturday. Much rests on Dom Dwyer and Benny Feilhaber, as always, but Jake Peterson has found some form, and has six goals on the season.</p> <p>The Quakes haven\u2019t lost at home to Sporting since 2000, and they\u2019ve enjoyed the best of recent meetings, but they\u2019ve picked a bad time to get in a funk: they\u2019re 0-3-3 since beating Vancouver on 12 August, and, despite their games in hand, the gap looks like it might be too much to breach.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re still in it,\u201d said Earthquakes head coach Dominic Kinnear after his side\u2019s useful 0-0 draw with Colorado last week. \u201cIf we would\u2019ve walked away with nothing, it\u2019s a bit damning. When we look at the standings, we have some games in hand on some people, but games in hand are only good if you win those games.\u201d He\u2019s right. They have to start winning, and quickly. <strong>TH</strong></p> <h2>Seattle travel to LA \u2013 and defeat might send them packing</h2> <p>And what about Seattle? The team with the big ground and big reputation had a lousy 2016, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/jul/27/sigi-schmid-seattle-sounders-mls\">Sigi Schmid paid for his side\u2019s underachievement with his job</a>. Brian Schmetzer has overseen an improvement since taking over at the end of July, but the Sounders still find themselves on the wrong side of the red line. It would represent a big blow for the club, and the league, if Seattle couldn\u2019t make the playoffs.</p> <p>Here\u2019s the deal: with six games to go, Seattle have 35 points, five points back of Sporting and six behind Portland, who occupy the remaining two spots in the playoffs. Four wins from those six might be enough to catch Sporting and sneak into sixth, but two of those games are away at LA and Dallas, whose home form is excellent. Defeat at the StubHub Center on Sunday could spell the end, especially if Sporting win at San Jose on Saturday night.</p> <p>So they\u2019ll have to do what no other team has done this season, and win a match in Carson. Galaxy are unbeaten in 15 games, and Schmetzer knows his team will be tested. \u201cLA is a good team and I respect [Galaxy head coach Bruce Arena],\u201d he said. \u201cHow do we play defense? Is Keane going to play? Is Dos Santos going to play? How does Bruce set up his team? We\u2019ll work on that during the week.\u201d</p> <p>He also emphasised the need to be clinical. \u201cWe\u2019re going to create 10-20 chances every game, when your chance comes you need to be able to put that in the back of the net. It might be one chance a game.\u201d</p> <p>Steven Gerrard has missed the previous five games with a hamstring injury, and Arena was coy on whether he\u2019ll be included. \u201cWe will see. The game is on Sunday,\u201d Arena said in the week. \u201cWe have to take it one day at a time, we can\u2019t rush ourselves.\u201d</p> <p>Giovani dos Santos, Galaxy\u2019s leading goalscorer, missed the 2-2 draw against Sporting with a sore hip, but he should be back for Sunday\u2019s big game, televised live on ESPN. LA are seeking a top-two spot that will give them a first-round bye in the playoffs. Seattle have it all to do. <strong>TH</strong></p> <h2>The new MLS logos are out and Minnesota United wins </h2> <p>The league recently released the official badge logos for every team that will take part in 2017, and there\u2019s no doubt - despite <a href=\"http://www.foxsports.com/soccer/gallery/mls-club-logos-ranking-092116\">what Fox Sports may think</a> - Minnesota United wins it.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"93ccbd5b989cc25da63dc3a9307d24ff9c834caf\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/93ccbd5b989cc25da63dc3a9307d24ff9c834caf/36_0_695_417/500.png\" alt=\"Minnesota United\u2019s badge for next season.\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Minnesota United\u2019s badge for next season.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy of Minnesota United</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The crest\u2019s main focus is the common loon, the official state bird of Minnesota, of which there are approximately 12,000 who call this state their summer home.

All New York need to do to make it to the postseason is win, and history is in their favor: the red side of New York have won every game against Montreal at Red Bull Arena. It\u2019s a little trickier for the Canadians, who sit just two points above the red line. A loss, coupled with a victory from DC United (and anyone below them, really) and the comfort zone would fade away. Should be a great match. <strong tabindex=\"-1\">LME</strong></p>",
  "<p>The man who for decades has been Israel\u2019s best known literary voice is proclaiming his \u201cdeep love\u201d for \u201cone of the greatest Jews who ever lived\u201d. Amos Oz recalls falling for \u201cthis Jew\u201d many years ago, when, as a teenage kibbutznik, he became enchanted by \u201chis poetry, his humour, his compassion, his warmth, his simplicity\u201d. Oz\u2019s sweet hymn of praise is addressed to Jesus Christ.</p> <p>If that comes as a surprise, it\u2019s not only because Oz is an Israeli Jew. It\u2019s also because he\u2019s written often \u2013 and fiercely \u2013 of the role centuries of Christian persecution played in nurturing the Jewish longing for a homeland. But whatever anger he harbours toward Christian Europe, for Jesus, Oz expresses only fond admiration. Even if, the writer adds with a smile, \u201che and I disagree on many things \u2013 like any two Israelis\u201d.</p> <p>Now aged 77, his spectacles attached to a cord around his neck, he is still blessed with the rugged good looks and spellbinding English that have made international literary audiences swoon since the 1970s. This autumn cinemagoers might join them, thanks to the release of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/may/15/cannes-2015-a-tale-of-love-and-darkness-review-natalie-portman-film-directing-debut\" title=\"\">Natalie Portman\u2019s film adaptation</a> of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2004/sep/11/featuresreviews.guardianreview\" title=\"\"><em>A Tale of Love and Darkness</em></a>, Oz\u2019s bestselling memoir-cum-novel. But&#xa0;for now he is in London to promote his latest novel, the first for more than&#xa0;a decade: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/sep/03/judas-by-amos-oz-review\" title=\"\"><em>Judas</em></a> in English, it was published in Hebrew as <em>The Gospel According to Judas</em>.</p> <p>In neatly formed, well-honed paragraphs, he tells me of his teenage fascination with the New Testament. \u201cI&#xa0;realised at the age of 16 that unless I&#xa0;read the gospels, I would never have access to Renaissance art, to the music of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/jsbach\" title=\"\">Bach</a> or the novels of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/fyodordostoevsky\" title=\"\">Dostoevsky</a>. So in the evenings, when the other boys went to play basketball or chase girls \u2013 I&#xa0;had no chance in either \u2013 I found my comfort in Jesus.\u201d</p> <p>For most of his contemporaries, especially then, the New Testament would have felt like forbidden territory, a place nice Jewish boys feared to tread. But Oz and Jesus had a family connection. His great-uncle, the scholar Joseph Klausner, was the author of <em>Jesus of Nazareth</em>, published in 1921, a book that scandalised Jews and Christians alike: it reclaimed Jesus as a Jew. As Oz puts it, \u201cJesus was born a Jew and he died a Jew. It never occurred to him to establish a new religion. He never crossed himself: he had no reason to. He never set one foot in a church. He went to synagogue.\u201d</p> <p>But as much as the young Oz was enthralled by Jesus, the story of Judas irritated him. Not theologically. But rather \u201cthe little detective within me\u201d was appalled by the Judas tale, which, Oz says, is a \u201cvicious, ugly story\u201d, arresting for being so badly written: had the gospels had a decent editor, he says, it would have been struck out.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>This is not an innocent story. It is responsible for rivers of blood, for generations of hatred and persecution</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Nothing about it adds up. Judas Iscariot is meant to be a rich man, yet he performs his great act of treachery for just 30 pieces of silver \u2013 \u201cabout \u00a3400 in&#xa0;today\u2019s money\u201d. A decent sum, but surely not enough to provide a motive. And why would Jesus\u2019s pursuers need&#xa0;Judas to point him out via the unforgettable gesture of a kiss? The miracle-worker was already notorious in Roman&#xa0;Jerusalem, having caused such&#xa0;a commotion at the temple. None&#xa0;of it makes any sense, says Oz.</p> <p>These inconsistencies nagged away at him for more than half a century. Not least because the Judas legend has had grave consequences. \u201cThis is not an innocent story. This story is responsible, more than any other story told in history, for rivers of blood, for generations of hatred and persecution and inquisition and massacres and possibly the Holocaust.\u201d</p> <p>For Judas is a double synonym: a byword for traitor, but also for Jew. \u201cIn&#xa0;my dictionaries, it\u2019s difficult to distinguish the two,\u201d Oz says, before rattling off the words for Jew and Judas in both German and Spanish: in each language, the two words sound almost the same. How could a three year old German child, hearing the word for Judas, the ultimate betrayer, separate that concept from their idea of \u201cJew\u201d, asks Oz. In his view, the story of Judas is \u201cthe Chernobyl of world antisemitism\u201d.</p> <p>And yet it took the arrival of this new novel\u2019s central character to suggest a way of wrestling with the Judas problem at long last. (Oz tends to speak this way about his characters: as if they are wholly independent actors, constantly able to surprise him, even to move him to tears, by words and deeds they choose for themselves. In line with Jewish conceptions of the Almighty, Oz&#xa0;may be their creator, but they have free will.)</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d70ef3f0897d723597ce07135958f8017a857603\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d70ef3f0897d723597ce07135958f8017a857603/0_0_3504_2339/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Natalie Portman in A Tale of Love and Darkness.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"668\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Natalie Portman in <em>A Tale of Love and Darkness</em>.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The protagonist in question is Shmuel Ash, a cuddly, clumsy, directionless postgraduate student who answers a noticeboard advert seeking a paid live-in companion for a lonely, aged intellectual. The novel follows one Jerusalem winter, as 1959 turns into 1960, in the small house occupied by Ash, the old man and his mysterious, fortysomething, widowed daughter-in-law, Atalia. (Oz says she reminds him of the Jerusalem of his youth: \u201cShe\u2019s not young. She\u2019s very beautiful. She\u2019s deeply injured. She is ferociously independent and she is very angry.\u201d) As&#xa0;Oz himself says, much of the book consists of this trio drinking gallons of tea and talking, talking, talking.</p> <p>Many of the familiar Oz motifs are present. A triangle, or series of intersecting triangles, each containing two men and a woman. A protagonist paralysed into inaction. A woman out of reach. A mystery, perhaps a buried scandal, related to the country\u2019s recent past. But what will gladden those readers who may have found some of Oz\u2019s past fiction forbidding, even as they lapped up his journalism and essays \u2013 delighting in their moral rigour and deployment of fresh, clarifying metaphor \u2013 is that this novel offers aspects of both genres. It is a novel of ideas, packed with argument and inquiry, displaying Oz\u2019s dizzying range of skills.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Judas believed in Jesus more than Jesus believed in himself</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>For Ash\u2019s field of inquiry is Jewish attitudes to Jesus and, especially, the maligning of Judas. He unfolds his theory of the true story of Judas \u2013 a tour de force that, alone, ensures this book will linger in the memory.</p> <p>Ash presents a persuasive case that, far from being a betrayer, Judas was the truest believer in Jesus. Indeed, the&#xa0;tragedy was that, as Oz puts it, \u201cHe&#xa0;believed in Jesus more than Jesus believed in himself.\u201d Judas put aside his initial scepticism and became convinced that the Nazarene truly was the one: the purity of his teachings, the wonder of his miracles, left no doubt in his mind.</p> <p>But to convince the wider public, a few remarkable feats of magic in the Galilee would not be enough. As Oz tells me, Jesus would have to pull off something incredible \u201con prime time television\u201d in Jerusalem, where everyone would witness it. If he were to be crucified and yet miraculously defy his own death, somehow climbing down from the cross in front of a watching Jerusalem public, why, then everyone would bow down to him in an instant: the kingdom of heaven would be upon us.</p> <p>Jesus was anxious, fearing his own death, but Judas was adamant. He played the impresario, working overtime to nudge the authorities to crucify this wonder-worker from Galilee \u2013 not because he did not believe in him, but because he did. Judas got his way, but when he saw that Jesus was not able to&#xa0;escape his fate, that he could not come down from the cross, that his father had forsaken him, he was distraught. He understood his mistake and duly hanged himself. \u201cSo died... the first Christian. The last Christian. The only Christian.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/sep/05/judas-amos-oz-review\">Judas by Amos Oz \u2013 review</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It is a remarkable reimagining of this toxic tale, one that would indeed, in Oz\u2019s words, \u201cneutralise the lethal radiation\u201d of antisemitism\u2019s Chernobyl, were it ever to become the accepted view of Judas. Instead, Judas remains the hated betrayer, routinely depicted in artists\u2019 evocations of the Last Supper with the&#xa0;dark, exaggerated features of anti-Jewish caricature \u2013 a man apart from his fellow apostles who are, oddly enough, all fair skinned and blessed with Aryan good looks.</p> <p>This thesis sits comfortably in the novel because both share a defining theme: treachery. The enigmatic widow, Atalia, saw her father ostracised as a traitor, shunned for opposing the establishment of the state of Israel a decade earlier. He was an idealist, with a Jesus-like faith in universal love and brotherhood. He opposed all states, with their borders and flags and armies, and hoped that Jews and Arabs might live side by side in a loose community free of such apparatus. For this, he was accused of treason.</p> <p>Oz does not share the dead man\u2019s politics \u2013 he stresses that while he may be a peacenik, he has never been a pacifist \u2013 but he knows what it\u2019s like to&#xa0;be branded a traitor. He denounced the occupation of the territories Israel conquered in 1967 almost as soon as the six-day war was over, when his countrymen were still giddy with victory. A soldier in that conflict \u2013 and again in 1973 \u2013 Oz first came to prominence as one of a group of young kibbutznik writers who assembled a dissenting collection on the war just won: <em>The Seventh Day</em>. Long before it became a matter of international diplomatic consensus, Oz was advocating the partition of historical Palestine into two states \u2013 Israel and Palestine \u2013 alongside each other. And he was a founder member of the movement that became famous as Peace Now.</p> <p>At each turn, strident voices on the nationalist right have been quick to denounce him as a <a href=\"http://forward.com/news/breaking-news/332428/right-wing-group-sorry-for-calling-israeli-artists-traitors/\" title=\"\">betrayer of his people</a>. He says he regards it as \u201ca badge of honour\u201d, offering a rollcall of visionaries who were similarly denounced for treason, starting with the prophet Jeremiah and including Abraham Lincoln, the German officers who plotted to assassinate Hitler, Charles de&#xa0;Gaulle, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2010/oct/07/archive-president-sadat-assassinated\" title=\"\">Anwar Sadat</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/mikhail-gorbachev\" title=\"\">Mikhail Gorbachev</a> and, closer to home, Israel\u2019s founder, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/from-the-archive-blog/2012/may/14/archive-1948-establishment-israel-jewish-state\" title=\"\">David Ben-Gurion</a> along with Menachem Begin, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/nov/02/israel-yitzhak-rabin-assassination-palestinian-military-solution\" title=\"\">Yitzhak Rabin</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/shimon-peres\" title=\"\">Shimon Peres</a> \u2013 all Israeli leaders excoriated at some point for their readiness to compromise on territory.

For Oz, an&#xa0;accusation of betrayal is often the reward a person receives simply for the act of changing. If they change their mind, they are accused of betraying the cause \u2013 even if they are simply finding a new way to serve the cause better.</p> <p>And yet change they must. \u201cThis is&#xa0;my political credo and this is my business as a novelist: the changes that&#xa0;occur in the hearts and minds of people.\u201d Think of Begin or <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/ariel-sharon\" title=\"\">Ariel Sharon</a>, longtime hawks who found themselves pulling out of occupied territory and uprooting Israeli settlements. Admittedly, the changes experienced by Oz\u2019s characters tend to be of the subtler, less spectacular variety, but the essential truth is the same: Oz insists that people&#xa0;have a tendency to surprise us&#xa0;\u2013&#xa0;and themselves.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fda5004b41a6cc6079cc93fbd7e8edb10b0405fd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fda5004b41a6cc6079cc93fbd7e8edb10b0405fd/0_0_2008_1252/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Amos Oz in 1999.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"624\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Amos Oz in 1999.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Sillitoe/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>So what about him? How has he changed? On the core issues, he seems remarkably consistent, despite the dramatic shifts that have shaped and reshaped his small country. I first interviewed him in 1985, when I was 18. He&#xa0;was younger then than I am now. I remember asking him about the biblical injunction that the people of Israel be \u201ca light unto the nations\u201d. At the time, he told me that the day Israel abandoned that objective would be the day he would lose interest in Israel as a project.</p> <p>\u201cI take it back,\u201d he says now. \u201cIsrael should aspire to be a decent country. That\u2019s good enough for me.\u201d</p> <p>And what of the two state solution, an idea for which he was something of an intellectual pioneer nearly 50 years ago? Many who believe it\u2019s right in principle have given up on it in practice, believing the moment has passed: 50 years of occupation and settlements have made it impossible. AB Yehoshua told <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/apr/22/ab-yehoshua-books-interview-the-extra-israel-palestine\" title=\"\">the Guardian earlier this year</a>: \u201cWe have to rethink the two state solution.\u201d It was not good enough to repeat the same old slogan for half a century.</p> <p>Oz is impatient with such impatience. He believes nothing in human affairs is irrevocable. If De Gaulle could move a&#xa0;million settlers out of Algeria, Israel could take its settlers out of the West Bank \u2013 if it had the will to do it.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2009/feb/14/amos-oz-interview\">Interview: Amos Oz</a> </p> </aside>  <p>And he makes a point about time. \u201cDifferent clocks are working simultaneously,\u201d he says, meaning that there are always different time scales at work. He\u2019s opposed the occupation for every one of its 50 years. But compared with the many centuries the people of Europe took to stop killing each other and settle their borders? The Palestinian-Israeli conflict \u201cjust began yesterday\u201d.</p> <p>Besides, he\u2019s suspicious of those who are so insistent that the two state solution is dead. He points to the curious alliance of \u201cthe Israeli far right and the radical left in Europe, including this country [Britain]. Both are amplifying the same music, saying, \u2018There\u2019s no going back on the occupation, the only&#xa0;solution is to live ... in one state.\u2019 I&#xa0;think this is nonsense.\u201d He is especially impatient with the leftist vision of a single state, which he brands a kind of&#xa0;\u201ckitsch\u201d, imagining that the two peoples can forget the bloodshed and conflict of the last century and \u201cjump into bed with each other, like in a lousy Hollywood movie\u201d.</p> <p>That\u2019s just one of many scoldings Oz is keen to dish out to the harder edges of the continental and British left. On this visit, he told <em>Newsnight</em> <a href=\"http://www.jpost.com/Israel-News/Politics-And-Diplomacy/Amos-Oz-Those-who-deny-Israels-right-to-exist-are-antisemites-467706\" title=\"\">that to argue that Israel should not exist</a> is to cross the line from anti-Zionism into antisemitism, because no one \u201cever said after Hitler that Germany should cease to exist, or after Stalin that there should be no Russia\u201d. He believes that if you want to change Israel, boycotting it is foolish because \u201cit deepens the Israeli paranoia that the whole world is against us\u201d, thereby strengthening the Israeli right.</p> <p>And he notes what he feels is a double standard. He thinks liberals overlook violence in parts of the developing world, \u201csaying, \u2018Well those people have suffered a lot, you have to understand it is only natural they are violent.\u2019\u201d But, \u201cWhen it comes to the Jews they often say: \u2018Well, they have suffered so much. How can they be violent after such an experience?\u2019\u201d In our conversation, he gives short shrift to those who think the&#xa0;Holocaust should have turned Jews into pacifists. He recalls the words of a&#xa0;relative of his, a survivor of the Nazi concentration camps, who always reminded him that her liberators \u201cwere not peace demonstrators with placards and olive branches. They were soldiers, with helmets and sub-machine guns. A&#xa0;Jew of my generation cannot afford to forget it.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Societies immersed in conflict tend to become more racist, intolerant and unforgiving</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>None of which is to suggest he\u2019s happy with the status quo in Israel. On&#xa0;the contrary, he says frankly: \u201cI love Israel, but I don\u2019t like it very much.\u201d What he loves remains the same as it&#xa0;ever was. \u201cI love it because of the argumentativeness, because every staircase in Israel is full of memories and stories and conflicting ideas.\u201d But&#xa0;he resents, he <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b07tqpxx\" title=\"\">says</a>, \u201cthe politics, the&#xa0;occupation, the oppression of the Palestinian people and the deterioration in civil rights standards.\u201d He thinks \u201c50 years of occupation and 100 years of solitude\u201d have taken their toll, adding that \u201csocieties immersed in conflict tend to become more racist, intolerant and unforgiving\u201d. With the weariness of a man who has seen too much history, he reflects that \u201clong wars stink\u201d.</p> <p>Yet he remains resistant to any quick fixes or revolutionary answers. As the old man in the new novel says, big sweeping dreams of world reform \u201calways involve slaughter, crusades or jihad or Gulag or the wars of Gog and Demagogue\u201d. Indeed, this aversion to all-encompassing ideological dogmas is another Oz theme. His bestselling essay, \u201cHow to Cure a Fanatic\u201d, is now taught in Swedish schools.</p> <p>\u201cA fanatic wants to change other people for their own good,\u201d Oz tells me. \u201cHe\u2019s a great altruist, more interested in you than in himself. He wants to save your soul, change you, redeem you \u2013 and if you prove to be irredeemable, he will be at your throat and kill you. For your own good.\u201d Oz worries that the current era is proving hospitable to fanatics, who exist on every side and in every culture, because \u201cas things get more complicated, people crave the simple, one-sentence answer to everything\u201d.</p> <p>The novelist says he\u2019s always preferred \u201csolutions, not salvations\u201d, confirmation that for all his teenage infatuation with Jesus, he never did become a Christian. And so he keeps rising at 4am \u2013 the legacy of all those years on the kibbutz, waking early to milk the cows \u2013 leaving the Tel Aviv apartment he calls home, and taking a walk \u2013 limping slightly, thanks to a war wound \u2013 to the beach or the park to clear his head. And when he sees a window with a light on, he still finds himself imagining what\u2019s keeping that person up at night, what\u2019s troubling them.

In 2012, closing the camp was mooted due to \u201ceconomic concerns\u201d, and last year, the Kenyan deputy president, William Ruto, said Dadaab would be shut within three months, although this never happened.</p> <p>From the attack on the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/04/westgate-mall-attacks-kenya\">Westgate shopping mall</a> to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/apr/02/kenya-attack-survivors-garissa-al-shabaab\">slaughter at Garissa</a> University College, the Kenyan government has long blamed Somali refugees for insecurity, but for people in the camp, the most recent announcement feels like the most serious yet. The government disbanded the department for refugee affairs and politicians are keen to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/28/kenya-seaside-look-peaceful-murderous-war-al-shabaab\">appear in control</a> of national security, with a presidential election coming up next year.</p> <p>It is true that security has become an issue here. There is one main dusty road that runs through Ifo. I used to go there as a child to watch the cars drive past at exactly 8am, every day, etched with UN letters, carrying workers to their field offices. Today, it is almost dormant. </p> <p>Two Spanish aid workers from Doctors Without Borders were <a href=\"http://www.catalannewsagency.com/society-science/item/the-two-spanish-msf-workers-kidnapped-in-kenya-21-months-ago-are-released\">kidnapped in October 2011</a> and there have been multiple explosions over the years.

The narrow path I walked to school is a graveyard and the hospital I attended as a child lies in ruins.</p> <h2><strong>What happens to us?</strong></h2> <p>The government has said we should return to Somalia voluntarily. This week, it <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-kenya-refugees-idUSKCN11R270\">asked the UN</a> for financial support, but has not disclosed many details on how our return can happen quickly and humanely. </p> <p>The UN refugee agency has a plan. UNHCR suggests that refugees awaiting resettlement in a third country, and those not originally from Somalia \u2013 about 30,000 people \u2013 should be rehomed at the Kakuma refugee camp, about 450 miles from Nairobi. </p> <p>It says 42,000 people living in Dadaab are registered Kenyan nationals and should be reintegrated into local communities. The remaining 170,000 refugees must return to Somalia.</p> <p>My family are in the first category. The UN opened a resettlement case for us in 2004 and we were supposed to go to live in the US.

Some, such as Hawa Abdi, 23, have gone back to Somalia of their own accord. I spoke to the mother of three children in Ifo II a week before she left in July. She explained that she had fled Sakow in 2011 after the devastating drought in Somalia. </p> <p>Abdi had heard that rainfall was predicted for her home town. \u201cIf Kenya doesn\u2019t want us, why should we stay here?\u201d she asked. </p> <p>But for Fatuma Mohamed, 44, a long-term resident of Ifo, this is home. Mohamed fled Somali in 1991 and has since married and had eight children here. \u201cThe land we had in Somalia has long been taken away and we don\u2019t have a place to return to ... I don\u2019t know what to do,\u201d she said, speaking at her polythene-thatched home with a kitchen made out of twigs.</p> <p>Mohamed Issack, 20, who grew up in Dagahaley, dreams of being accepted by his host country. \u201cI would have loved to be a Kenyan and free to live in any part of this country ... but that is not an option for me,\u201d he said. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/asadhussein_/status/738851697192259588\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Who has the courage to stand at the place where they were born and not cry?

  "<p><sup>\u201c</sup>Isn\u2019t it true that everyone has his own collection of stories?\u201d asked Julio Cort\u00e1zar in a 1971 essay on the short story. As with poetry, short-story collections have something of the mixtape about them, and any enthusiast of the form will, from time to time, compile an imaginary, ideal anthology. The form\u2019s brevity allows for a variety of tonal and stylistic shifts along the length of an anthology, and if the selection is judicious, a standard of excellence can be maintained throughout. For that reason, some readers find anthologies a more rewarding way to engage with short stories than single-author collections, which, rare instances aside, flag sooner or later; it\u2019s hard enough for a writer to produce a single great short story, never mind a dozen of them.&#xa0;</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2016/aug/19/sarah-hall-sex-and-death-short-stories\">Sarah Hall: sex, death and the short story</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But different types of anthology present different challenges. \u201cBest of\u201d editors have the benefit of choosing from a virtually unlimited field, restricted only by taste, knowledge and stamina; Philip Hensher, at the iron man end of the scale, estimates that he read 20,000 stories in two years when deciding on the contents of his two-volume <em>Penguin Book of the British Short Story</em>. Editors of themed collections must necessarily choose from a more limited array, while those compiling by theme but also looking for new, or at least previously unpublished work, as is the case with <em>Sex &amp; Death</em>, find it hardest of all to sustain overall quality. After all, what are the chances of all your invited contributors being able to produce, or have lying in their drawer, a top-notch story on the theme specified? Given this, it was wise of Sarah Hall and Peter Hobbs to select subjects as capacious as sex and death: \u201cHow we come in and how we go out,\u201d they write in their introduction, \u201cthese are the governing drives, our two greatest themes.\u201d &#xa0;</p> <p>Most of the contributing authors try to encompass both parts of the theme, although there is surprisingly little actual sex, and no descriptions of death to equal the \u201cevil-smelling emptiness\u201d Hemingway writes of in <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/snows-of-kilimanjaro.html\" title=\"\">\u201cThe Snows of Kilimanjaro\u201d</a>, or the \u201cblack sack into which an invisible, invincible force\u201d attempts to push Tolstoy\u2019s ailing court official in <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/catalog/product/view/id/378126/\" title=\"\"><em>The Death of Ivan Ilyich</em></a>, perhaps the greatest of all works of fiction about dying.

To wake up in her own home, smack in the middle of this life she had&#xa0;not chosen, and find herself despised.\u201d Coady\u2019s story is scathing, but the book\u2019s most menacing exploration of&#xa0;sexual desire is Sarah Hall\u2019s \u201cEvie\u201d, where physical disease prompts a malformed desire and a profoundly disquieting threesome.</p> <p>The threat of death hovers in the background of Hall\u2019s story, but the work that most powerfully unites the collection\u2019s two themes is Alexander MacLeod\u2019s \u201cThe Closing Date\u201d. Here the narrator looks back to a time when, staying at a motel, his young family briefly crossed paths with a serial killer.

Twelve months ago they were changing hands at 748p.</p> <p>Forsey started working for Ashley as a teenager three decades ago. In June, after months of criticism of the company, Forsey gave up a share award worth \u00a33.7m he was due to receive next year. He has been paid a salary of \u00a3150,000 but no annual bonus.</p> <p>\u201cI have given my entire working life to the company and in return the company has given me amazing opportunities and experiences,\u201d Forsey said in a statement. \u201cI wish everyone at Sports Direct well in the future.\u201d</p> <p>Sports Direct\u2019s chairman, Keith Hellawell, who has also been under fire, thanked Forsey for his \u201csignificant contribution over the last 32 years and during a period of significant growth and change at the company\u201d.</p> <p>The company also announced that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/dec/10/whos-who-at-sports-direct-mike-ashley\">Karen Byers, its head of retail</a>, had been promoted to global head of operations and Sean Nevitt, head of buying, had been elevated to global head of commercial.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/mar/26/karen-byers-sports-direct-hard-hitting-head-retail\">Byers, a multimillionaire, has been described as a tough \u201cworkaholic\u201d</a> and as \u201cthe person who sets the rules\u201d. She has had a crucial role in the Sports Direct growth story since joining the firm 24 years ago as a shop manager. She caught Ashley\u2019s eye when she sold him a pair of jeans in a store he was buying.</p> <p>Independent retail analyst Nick Bubb said: \u201cPoor old Dave Forsey may have fallen on his sword, but he did act as a human shield to Mike Ashley and it is not clear how somebody who admitted to MPs a few months ago that the Sports Direct business was getting too big for him will get on with now being the real CEO.\u201d</p> <p>This week, <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/sep/20/sports-direct-bows-to-pressure-and-agrees-to-independent-review\">Sports Direct bowed to shareholder pressure by agreeing to an independent review</a> of its working practices and corporate governance.</p> <p>Ashley said he had not known about the poor treatment of employees but claimed there was little wrong at Sports Direct, telling BBC Breakfast on Tuesday that problems at the company\u2019s warehouse were caused by \u201cthe odd rotten apple\u201d.</p> <p>He said: \u201cIt is odd, isolated instances. It\u2019s the odd rotten apple in the barrel and then you say: \u2018OK, I\u2019ve got to go and find the rotten apple in the barrel\u2019 \u2026 I\u2019m now coming in to work very closely with HR, the warehouse and the [employment] agencies.\u201d</p> <p>The sportswear tycoon announced plans earlier in September to put an employee on the company\u2019s board to show its willingness to listen to staff, after its reputation was battered by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/dec/09/how-sports-direct-effectively-pays-below-minimum-wage-pay\">the Guardian\u2019s revelations</a> and a campaign by the Unite union.</p> <p>Joshua Raymond, a market analyst at XTB.com, was surprised that Forsey\u2019s departure had not been announced at Sports Direct\u2019s recent annual general meeting. \u201cHe seemed to have come through the crisis over the firm\u2019s working conditions with a vigour to rectify the problems despite huge pressure from the media and large shareholders.<br></p> <p>\u201cNevertheless whilst the change would have long been mooted by shareholders, the fact Mike Ashley immediately assumes the CEO role will keep a laser focused attention on the firm\u2019s ability to recover from the crisis. This point is even more pertinent given much of the concern focused on Ashley\u2019s power grip on all aspects of the retailer, a grip which has just become even stronger.\u201d</p> <p>The company has also come under growing pressure from large City investors to make changes. More than half of independent shareholders (57%) failed to support Hellawell at the AGM, but Ashley insisted he was staying in the chairman role for at least another year to help him fix the problems.<br></p> <p>The law firm Reynolds Porter Chamberlain (RPC), which has long worked with Ashley and Sports Direct, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/sep/06/sports-direct-to-ditch-zero-hours-contracts\">carried out a preliminary review published this month</a> and had been tasked with a further investigation. However, after shareholders called for an independent review at the retailer\u2019s annual meeting, the company said it would ask someone else to conduct it.</p> <p>RPC\u2019s report, published the day before the AGM, criticised the company and prompted Ashley to apologise to staff for practices that were \u201cpotentially oppressive\u201d at its warehouse.</p> <p>Paul Lee, head of corporate governance at Aberdeen Asset Management, said Ashley\u2019s move into the top job should be only temporary while the retailer finds a new boss from outsiode the organidsation: \u201cMy perception and my hope is that Ashley taking over is an interim measure while they go out and seek a new, strong candidate to take on the CEO role. We voted against Dave Forsey because we were very clear that the management team as it stood wasn\u2019t capable of running the business. Ashley himself has said so. </p> <p>\u201cThere may be an internal candidate but we think an external appointment is needed. Ashley is the heart of the business and we should be ensuring he is surrounded by the right team to build on the success they have had over the last several years, someone who is capable of managing a company of Sports Direct\u2019s size and scale.\u201d</p> <ul> <li>Producing in-depth, thoughtful, well-reported journalism is difficult and expensive - but supporting us isn\u2019t.

  "<h2>1) Wenger\u2019s anniversary should not mask significance of derby</h2> <p>On a weekend when much will be made of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/21/arsene-wenger-20-years-arsenal-incredible-journey\">Ars\u00e8ne Wenger\u2019s 20th anniversary</a> as Arsenal manager, the Frenchman would not be human if he didn\u2019t recall the manner in which Chelsea ruined the occasion of his 1,000th game in charge. It was March 2014 and on a strange afternoon at Stamford Bridge, Andre Marriner sent off Kieran Gibbs in a case of mistaken identity, as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/mar/22/chelsea-arsenal-premier-league-match-report\">Jos\u00e9 Mourinho\u2019s side hit their visitors for six without reply</a>. Arsenal had already lost 6-3 at Manchester City and 5-1 at Liverpool that season, capitulations that rendered Wenger\u2019s team and any aspirations they had towards a title win a laughing stock. With apologies to Leicester fans, this is the second big test of Arsenal\u2019s credentials as potential title winners in six games. They have already failed the first, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/aug/14/arsenal-liverpool-premier-league-match-report\">against Liverpool</a>. Should they fail this one, against likely fellow contenders for a top four spot, the weekend airwaves will echo to the sound of seething Gooners repeating their forlorn and familiar lament that it\u2019s once again time for Wenger to go. <strong>BG<br></strong><br>\u2022 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/22/arsene-wenger-arsenal-20-years\">Barney Ronay: Wenger should have won more but English football owes him</a><br>\u2022 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/21/arsene-wenger-20-years-arsenal-incredible-journey\">Amy Lawrence: Wenger at Arsenal \u2013 a journey of joy and frustration</a><br>\u2022 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/gallery/2016/sep/22/arsene-wenger-20-years-arsenal-in-his-own-words\">Wenger\u2019s 20 years at Arsenal \u2013 in pictures and his own words</a></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/video/2016/sep/21/arsene-wenger-marks-20-years-since-appointment-arsenal-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/542n3\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2738019\"            data-video-name=\"Ars\u00e8ne Wenger marks 20 years since his appointment at Arsenal \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"theguardian.com\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-57e29489e4b080d3ee88afba\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/09/21/160920wenger_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/09/21/160920wenger.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/09/21/160920wenger_WebM.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/video/2016/sep/21/arsene-wenger-marks-20-years-since-appointment-arsenal-video\">Ars\u00e8ne Wenger marks 20 years since his appointment at Arsenal</a></figcaption> </figure>   <h2>2) Carrick\u2019s steady hand could allow Pogba to flourish</h2> <p>Michael Carrick turned 35 in the summer, but how much does that matter when his role has always been more about speed of thought than the speed in his legs? Even now he could be the cure for Manchester United\u2019s midfield ills. While the clamour for Wayne Rooney to be dropped grows, the England captain has not been the only issue for a team that seems unable to take control. Indeed Rooney\u2019s struggles have lessened the focus on other issues. Paul Pogba needs to be freed. While Marouane Fellaini has done a job, Carrick\u2019s measured play in a holding role could hand the world\u2019s most expensive player the chance to take the shackles off. Pogba has not exactly impressed so far, but he needs a chance to roam rather than hold and if Rooney remains undroppable, then swapping Carrick, who was steady against Northampton, for Fellaini seems the obvious route for the visit of Leicester. <strong tabindex=\"-1\">AS<br tabindex=\"-1\"></strong><br tabindex=\"-1\">\u2022 <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/22/jose-mourinho-hits-out-at-football-einsteins-for-trying-to-undermine-him-manchester-united\">Mourinho hits out at \u2018football Einsteins\u2019 for trying to undermine him</a><br tabindex=\"-1\">\u2022 <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/sep/22/jose-mourinho-manchester-united-master\">Jonathan Wilson: Mourinho is no longer the bright young iconoclast</a><br tabindex=\"-1\">\u2022 <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/22/wayne-rooney-manchester-united-rubbish-criticism\">Rooney insists he can deal with \u2018rubbish\u2019 criticism</a></p>  <figure class=\"element element-table\" data-canonical-url=\"https://frontend.gutools.co.uk/admin/football/player/card/competition/attack/447968/12/100\"> <div data-embed-type=\"table\" class=\"player-card player-card--football\" itemscope=\"\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\"> <div class=\"player-card__image-container\"> <img class=\"player-card__image\" itemprop=\"image\" src=\"https://sport.guim.co.uk/football/player-images/100/447968.jpg\" alt=\"Photo of Paul Pogba\"> </div> <div class=\"player-card__player\"> <div class=\"player-card__position\" itemprop=\"jobTitle\">Midfielder</div> <div class=\"player-card__name\" itemprop=\"name\">Paul Pogba</div> </div> <dl class=\"player-card__stats\"> <dt class=\"player-card__stat-name\">Appearances</dt> <dd class=\"player-card__stat-value\">4</dd>  <dt class=\"player-card__stat-name\">Goals</dt> <dd class=\"player-card__stat-value\">0</dd>  <dt class=\"player-card__stat-name\">Shots</dt> <dd class=\"player-card__stat-value\">13</dd>  <dt class=\"player-card__stat-name\">Shots on target</dt> <dd class=\"player-card__stat-value\">15%</dd>  <dt class=\"player-card__stat-name\">Offsides</dt> <dd class=\"player-card__stat-value\">0</dd> </dl> </div> </figure>  <h2>3) Another Anfield beatdown for Hull?</h2> <p>Hull have never won a competitive match at Liverpool in 10 attempts and have been subjected to some ferocious beatings on their trips to Anfield, conceding three or more goals on no fewer than six occasions.

Liverpool have already played the teams who finished first, second and third last season, while Chelsea are unlikely to be far off the pace this time around. Having put four past both Arsenal and Leicester, with EFL Cup smitings of two Championship sides thrown in for good measure, the potential for another thrashing of Hull at Anfield seems high.

After <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/17/west-ham-olympic-stadium-troubles\">all the problems</a> that have beset their new stadium, watching <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TSF/status/778330065797017600\">the footage and photos</a> of their beloved Boleyn Ground <a href=\"https://twitter.com/westhamfootball/status/778223233543856128/video/1\">being blown up</a> on Tuesday for a new Pierce Brosnan film called Final Score \u2013 described by producer Marc Goldberg as \u201cDie Hard in a soccer stadium\u201d \u2013 must have been heartbreaking.

Scoring is also a concern: only Michail Antonio has netted from open play since the first league game of the season, and Dimitri Payet cannot be expected to score <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/21/west-ham-united-accrington-stanley-efl-cup-match-report\">a last-minute free-kick</a> every match. <strong tabindex=\"-1\">MB<br tabindex=\"-1\"></strong><br tabindex=\"-1\">\u2022 <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/21/west-ham-united-accrington-stanley-efl-cup-match-report\">West Ham beat Accrington Stanley after Payet\u2019s last-minute strike</a></p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Football Weekly Extra\">  <iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"450\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/284109005&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false&amp;visual=true\"></iframe> <figcaption>Football Weekly Extraaaaa.</figcaption> </figure>  <h2>5) The start of two big months for Janssen</h2> <p>While Harry Kane takes <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/20/tottenham-harry-kane-out-eight-weeks-ankle-injury\">an enforced but apparently much-needed rest</a> after damaging ankle ligaments against Sunderland last weekend, Vincent Janssen will be given his chance to shine. The Dutch striker enjoyed a timely confidence boost by getting off the mark in Tottenham\u2019s EFL Cup <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/21/tottenham-hotspur-gillingham-efl-cup-match-report-eriksen\">rout of Gillingham</a> and can relax into his temporary role as Tottenham\u2019s go-to goal merchant safe in the knowledge that, barring a calamity, the position is his for up to two months. The omens for Janssen are good. Aged just 22, he was awarded this year\u2019s Johan Cruyff Trophy for Dutch talent of the year and has an admittedly brief history of scoring in bursts. Various fallow periods (some as long as one match) for AZ Alkmaar last season were punctuated by a run of three goals in two games, four in three, six in three, seven in seven, five in two and two in two. While goals in the Premier League are generally harder to come by for strikers making the transition from the Eredivisie, Janssen\u2019s past form suggests a goal glut is imminent. <strong>BG<br></strong><br>\u2022 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/22/danny-rose-tottenham-hotspur-five-year-contract\">Danny Rose commits to Tottenham Hotspur with new five-year contract</a></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3e5a86108aa9bf5286f1e2772b53cdc62939d65f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3e5a86108aa9bf5286f1e2772b53cdc62939d65f/190_0_5154_3638/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Vincent Janssen scores from the spot against Gillingham.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"706\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Vincent Janssen scores from the spot against Gillingham.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Julian Finney/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>6) Everton\u2019s steely (league) portcullis</h2> <p>In their first four games of this Premier League season, Everton conceded two goals. In the corresponding fixtures against Tottenham Hotspur (h), West Brom (a), Stoke City (h) and Sunderland (a) last season they shipped 10, five times that number. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/17/everton-middlesbrough-premier-league-match-report\">Last weekend</a> they conceded a decidedly contentious one against newly-promoted Middlesbrough to bring their tally of goals conceded this season to three in five matches, making theirs the second tightest defence in the division, behind only Spurs. While much of the credit for this commendable turnaround \u2013 <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/20/ronald-koeman-everton-norwich-efl-cup-alex-neil\">midweek defeat aside</a> \u2013 can be attributed to the club\u2019s decision to replace Roberto Mart\u00ednez with Ronald Koeman, a particularly mean defender in his playing pomp, the seamless introduction of Ashley Williams to the Everton back four is already making the \u00a311.9m purchase of the 32-year-old Wales skipper look like one of the signings of the season. With their combined age of 66, Williams and Phil Jagielka have forged quite the steely portcullis in the heart of Everton\u2019s defence, even if their team has only faced two teams from last season\u2019s top 10, one of whom finished ninth and is currently propping up the league. Against a Bournemouth side who are the joint-lowest scorers in the Premier League, this pair of old-timers seem unlikely to have a particularly testing afternoon. <strong tabindex=\"-1\">BG<br tabindex=\"-1\"></strong><br tabindex=\"-1\">\u2022 <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/22/ronald-koeman-rules-out-oumar-niasse-rescuing-everton-career\">Koeman rules out prospect of Niasse rescuing Everton career</a></p> <h2><strong>7) Time for Kelly to find his wings</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-table\" data-canonical-url=\"https://frontend.gutools.co.uk/admin/football/player/card/competition/defence/389502/5/100\"> <div data-embed-type=\"table\" class=\"player-card player-card--football\" itemscope=\"\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\"> <div class=\"player-card__image-container\"> <img class=\"player-card__image\" itemprop=\"image\" src=\"https://sport.guim.co.uk/football/player-images/100/389502.jpg\" alt=\"Photo of Martin Kelly\"> </div> <div class=\"player-card__player\"> <div class=\"player-card__position\" itemprop=\"jobTitle\">Defender</div> <div class=\"player-card__name\" itemprop=\"name\">Martin Kelly</div> </div> <dl class=\"player-card__stats\"> <dt class=\"player-card__stat-name\">Appearances</dt> <dd class=\"player-card__stat-value\">4</dd>  <dt class=\"player-card__stat-name\">Shots blocked</dt> <dd class=\"player-card__stat-value\">1</dd>  <dt class=\"player-card__stat-name\">Clearances</dt> <dd class=\"player-card__stat-value\">10</dd> </dl> </div> </figure>  <p>This is a make-or-break season for Martin Kelly. Entering the final season of his three-year contract at Crystal Palace, the former Liverpool defender failed to hold down a regular starting role under Alan Pardew last season, but has deputised well for Pape Souar\u00e9 recently, after the Senegalese left-back suffered <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/12/crystal-palace-defender-papa-souare-injured-motorway-crash\">an horrific car crash</a> earlier this month. However, with James Tomkins and now captain Scott Dann sidelined through injury, Kelly will be expected to hastily form a partnership with Damien Delaney in the centre of defence. On Wednesday it did not go well at Southampton, Kelly conceding a penalty just 15 minutes after coming on for Dann. No other team have scored fewer this season than Palace\u2019s opponents on Saturday, Sunderland, but Kelly will need to adapt quickly if he is to extend his short-term stint in the first team and his long-term future at the club. <strong>MB<br></strong><br>\u2022 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/21/qpr-sunderland-efl-cup-match-report\">Sunderland and McNair rally to see off QPR after Sandro strike</a></p> <h2>8) Sobhi can add some sparkle to stodgy Stoke</h2> <p>Perhaps the only positive for Stoke to take from a fifth defeat in a row, against Hull in the League Cup on Wednesday, was the performance of Ramadan Sobhi. The Egyptian winger appeared fearless on debut and considering the rut Mark Hughes\u2019s team find themselves in he may be worth a punt against West Brom in Tony Pulis\u2019s 1,000th game. It is hard to put a finger on what the matter is for a squad that is arguably stronger than last season\u2019s but the Potters require fresh impetus and Sobhi can bring that to the party. Hughes described the 19-year-old\u2019s performance against Hull as \u201cfantastic\u201d, adding that \u201che was always a threat\u201d. Factoring in the stodginess of West Brom\u2019s defence and Stoke\u2019s paucity in front of goal so far (which may have been overlooked to a degree because of their leaky back line), it could be a gamble worth taking. <strong tabindex=\"-1\">AS<br tabindex=\"-1\"></strong><br tabindex=\"-1\">\u2022 <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/19/mark-hughes-retains-support-stoke-city-board-frustrating-form\">Hughes retains support of Stoke City board despite frustrating form</a></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0f6ca715f3a8dbca464dd8257641c3f4c3d85ea1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0f6ca715f3a8dbca464dd8257641c3f4c3d85ea1/27_56_1233_862/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Could Ramadan Sobhi, left, be the player to help get Stoke up and running?\" width=\"1000\" height=\"699\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Could Ramadan Sobhi, left, be the player to help get Stoke up and running?</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Carl Recine/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>9) Another needless kit change?</strong></h2> <p>For anybody who didn\u2019t catch <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/21/swansea-city-manchester-city-efl-cup-match-report\">Manchester City\u2019s 2-1 win over Swansea City</a> in the EFL Cup on Wednesday, Pep Guardiola\u2019s side wore a monstrosity of a third kit \u2013 a purple and orange number which, according to the club, \u201cblends two unexpected colours to create a distinctive look that reflects the vibrancy and creativity at the heart of both club and city\u201d.

Just over 15 years ago, on a day remembered for the attacks on the Twin Towers, Sean Dyche got kicked in the head while playing for Millwall against Gillingham in a League Cup match and felt his nose shatter. \u201cMy memories of that were crystal because of what happened, not only that event but the bigger-picture event, 9/11,\u201d the Burnley manager would later recall in a fascinating interview with his former team-mate turned journalist and pundit Richie Sadlier, <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.independent.ie/sport/soccer/premier-league/sadlier-theres-no-such-thing-as-the-end-30693438.html\">the season before last</a>. \u201cI remember getting home and hardly being able to breathe and thinking \u2018two planes crashed into a building.\u2019\u201d It\u2019s a vignette that offers some insight into the perspective on life of a man happy to operate with the Premier League\u2019s smallest budget and who, in the same interview, illustrated what his side were up against by pointing out that \u00c1ngel di Mar\u00eda cost Manchester United more money than Burnley had spent on players in their entire history. They failed to stay up that season, but are back in the Premier League with few managers more secure in their jobs than Dyche. Despite their surprise win over Liverpool in the second game of the season, the signs are that Burnley will struggle again and with three of their next four matches against Arsenal, Everton and Manchester United, the acquisition of a point or three against Watford under the Turf Moor lights would be welcome. <strong tabindex=\"-1\">BG<br tabindex=\"-1\"></strong><br tabindex=\"-1\">\u2022 <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/19/walter-mazzarri-praised-for-instilling-winning-mentality-at-watford-juan-camilo-zuniga\">Mazzarri praised for instilling a \u2018winning mentality\u2019 at Watford</a></p>",

Inspiration for the series \u2013 written by Brand, Morwenna Banks, who starred in Skins, and Will Smith, a writer on The Thick of It \u2013 partly came from Brand\u2019s mother, a former social worker. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"6052d558622a25ad7e74de0ebfa7c3396a59ae98\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6052d558622a25ad7e74de0ebfa7c3396a59ae98/0_11_1772_1063/1000.jpg\" alt=\"left to right Al Kavanagh and Nitin\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A scene from Damned: co-writer Jo Brand has long hoped to make social workers \u2018seem like real people\u2019 and address negative stereotypes.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dave King/Channel 4</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cShe\u2019s 82 now but she still hasn\u2019t quite managed to retire,\u201d says Brand. \u201cShe\u2019s like an out-of-control, ancient revolutionary.\u201d<br></p> <p>Brand says she has long hoped to make social workers \u201cseem like real people\u201d and address the negative stereotypes of \u201cmiddle-class, tweedy women\u201d and \u201chippy do-gooders\u201d. </p> <p>\u201cPsychiatrists have a similar job to do; they have to predict how much harm someone is going to cause themselves or other people.

There is no safety when attacks are met with silence. When a colleague and I were in South Sudan last November, we heard of several recent violent attacks against aid workers. Despite clear confirmation of the incidents, none were reported or condemned publicly by the political leadership. The incidents became security anecdotes \u2013 devoid of humanity, dismissed as rumour. Impunity for prior attacks, the weakness of the United Nations Mission in South Sudan as a protection force, the negative local public campaign against NGOs, and the relentless intimidation of humanitarians were not the only factors, but all contributed in their own way to the Terrain incident.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"70f503852730d0fc45a2802e67651bb6e6510608\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/70f503852730d0fc45a2802e67651bb6e6510608/0_308_5068_3040/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Aid is seen strewn across the floor the morning after a convoy delivering aid was hit by a deadly air strike.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Aid is seen strewn across the floor the morning after a convoy delivering aid to Aleppo was hit by a deadly air strike.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Omar Haj Kadour/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>During my last trip to the border of Syria in May this year, my colleagues and I met with NGOs carrying out cross-border programmes.

  "<p>Hardly a day passes without an announcement by one newspaper publisher or another that jobs must go, titles must be merged and offices must be closed.<br></p> <p>Cutbacks have been the reality of the news trade in Britain for the best part of 20 years at national, regional and local level. And the same story has been unfolding in the USA, Canada, Australia and most European countries.</p> <p>The cause, as we all know, is the onward march of the digital revolution. We who praise its advance cannot also help but lament its disruption. </p> <p>Everyone involved in the business registers concern because its fate is so uncertain. We need to disaggregate the \u201ceveryone\u201d because publishers and journalists are seeking very different outcomes. Nor should we regard all publishers as a single entity. </p> <p>Publishers seeking only profit - such as the chains that control the bulk of the UK\u2019s regional papers - are different from those whose newspaper ownership is about prestige and political clout (and propaganda). </p> <p>And they are different again from the owner of the Guardian/Observer, the Scott Trust, which exists specifically to safeguard the papers\u2019 journalistic freedom and liberal values \u201cfree from commercial or political interference.\u201d<br></p> <p>But no publisher, despite differing motivations, can escape the commercial effects of a technological revolution that is in the process of destroying the funding mechanism that has underpinned newspaper companies for more than 150 years.</p> <p>Journalists are aware of this but tend to turn a blind eye to reality. They blame publishers for the cutbacks, or at least, the way those cutbacks are carried out. I know, because I have done so plenty of times in the past, belabouring, say, Trinity Mirror or Newsquest or the Telegraph Media Group for the imposition of cuts.</p> <p>Some have been more ruthless or cack-handed than others. Nor have journalists been too happy about executives enjoying handsome rewards for implementing redundancy programmes, a constant refrain by the National Union of Journalists.</p> <p>It is irritating, probably intensely annoying, for those required to walk the plank. It does not, however, change matters. Whether chief executives are unpopular or over-paid or even incompetent is largely irrelevant. All are in the same boat and their task is clear: to ensure the survival of \u201cthe product\u201d for as long as possible.</p> <p>They must do so whether they work for public companies, where the appetites of investors must be satisfied, or private companies, where owners seek to make profits or, at worst, keep losses to a minimum.</p> <p>Although journalists, even those without a smattering of economic knowledge, know this to be the case, they find it difficult to be dispassionate about it, not least because they are in the firing line.</p> <p>Leaving aside the grumbles of veteran hacks who have never come to terms with the post-Fleet Street era, journalists who have enthusiastically grasped the advances offered by digital transmission have also begun to be hugely critical of their employers.</p> <p>They have registered their anger about job insecurity, falling wages (including much reduced payments to freelance contributors) and sometimes poor working conditions, such as the pressure to work longer hours, to move house to keep their jobs or to travel further to reach their offices. </p> <p>They also complain about apparent changes of direction by their managers who are struggling to cope with the fast-moving digital environment. <br></p> <p>Then again, those of us who have been around for a long time know that journalists have a long history of bellyaching. It goes with the territory. We always know better than those above us. </p> <p>Nor are journalists really appreciative of the fact that the audiences for our journalism are far greater than we enjoyed in the pre-internet era. They dismiss the figures as the result of clickbait, and in some instances, but not all, they may be correct: maximising eyeballs is helpful in attracting advertisers (just as it was, and is, with newsprint sales).</p> <p>Meanwhile, the overarching concern of all journalists is the gradual reduction in their overall numbers and the retreat from face-to-face, eye-witness reporting. At the international level, foreign postings have all but vanished. Nationally, regional offices have been closed. As for the headquarters\u2019 staffs, they spend decreasing amounts of time on the road.</p> <p>Similarly, fewer and fewer reporters on regional and local papers are allowed leave their offices. Conceding that much more can be accomplished on computers than was ever the case in shoe-leather days of yore (we now take online data journalism for granted, for instance), it remains the case that journalism is undergoing severe retrenchment.</p> <p>Doubtless, many of the essays in a forthcoming book with an somewhat optimistic title, Is print dying... and how to avoid it,* will detail what is largely regarded as \u201ca crisis\u201d. </p> <p>If the authors (including me) are honest they will point to the distinction between the crisis facing publishers and the one facing journalists. In other words, they must differentiate between journalism as a business and journalism as a public service.</p> <p>This is the reasoning behind my earlier statement about publishers and journalists seeking different outcomes and it is the crucial split between the two.</p> <p>The crisis we journalists face at the hands of publishers is the destruction of our trade and therefore the annihilation of a public service. This is not to criticise publishers, which is why I spent some time explaining the pressures they face and the way they are tackling them. It is simply to rationalise what is happening.</p> <p>Here, in a nutshell, is the reality. Journalists cost money. So the last thing newspaper publishers want nowadays are journalists. </p> <p>By which I mean reporters, on-the-road reporters who spend time and effort to seek out stories. They are too expensive and, viewed in strictly economic terms, unproductive. </p> <p>They can spend many days, sometimes weeks and even months, on their research. And what do most of them have to show for it at the end?</p> <p>Even if they land a story that provokes a political row, say, or brings down a high-ranking official, it is highly unlikely to attract new buyers.</p> <p>It might well add lustre to the newspaper, enhancing its status for holding power to account. But seen from a purely commercial perspective, reporters just aren\u2019t worth it. And they, rather than desk-bound journalists, are the ones being laid off. </p> <p>With them go skills and experience. With them go untold stories. With them goes the most potent and useful way of serving the public.</p> <p>Publishers need to recognise the direction of travel. The public and the politicians who represent them need to campaign for the retention of reporters. </p> <p>And the funding, you ask? As I have written before, and more than once, we need to find an accommodation with the hugely profitable and powerful new media organisations that benefit from the journalism they recommend. </p> <p>In fairness, publishers know that. As one senior News UK executive put it in an email to me a couple of days ago, \u201cthe republishing platforms reap financial rewards by distributing our content.\u201d </p> <p>But what happens when there is no-one to supply that content? In recognising the crisis, publishers and journalists must work together to find a solution.</p> <p><em>*Co-editors: Ray Snoddy, Richard Tait, Neil Fowler and John Mair, due to be published in February 2017.

  "<p>The most eagerly awaited iPhone since the last one, the Apple\u2019s iPhone 7 has arrived. Much has been said about its design, the absent headphone socket, and the fact that it\u2019s now waterproof, but is it actually any good?</p> <p>Following on from the iPhone 6 was a tall order, which the iPhone 6S struggled to live up to, with fewer sales and less consumer enthusiasm. Two years on, the question is whether those iPhone 6 buyers will bite and upgrade to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/sep/09/apple-smartphone-iphone-7-pre-orders\">the most expensive iPhone yet</a>, its price in the UK inflated thanks to the Brexit referendum result.</p> <h2>The same but now waterproof</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"919caa9c46d0d2d85806ebe7e9c4ec7f0a58b6bd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/919caa9c46d0d2d85806ebe7e9c4ec7f0a58b6bd/0_0_4101_2461/1000.jpg\" alt=\"iPhone 7 review\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The back of the matt black iPhone 7.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>On the outside the iPhone 7 (<a href=\"http://go.theguardian.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.johnlewis.com%2Fapple-iphone-7-ios-10-4-7-4g-lte-sim-free-32gb%2Fp2999556%3Fsku%3D237087204%26s_kwcid%3D2dx92700027609496618%26tmad%3Dc%26tmcampid%3D2%26gclid%3DEAIaIQobChMIieCDm_Kp1wIVEQ8YCh0PAwtCEAQYASABEgLnuPD_BwE%26gclsrc%3Daw.ds&amp;id=114047X1572903\">find here</a>) is so similar to the iPhone 6 and 6S you might think nothing has changed other than a new paint job: it\u2019s now available in black and a shiny jet black, as well as rose gold, gold and silver from last year, but no space grey .</p> <p>The antenna lines \u2013 the plastic inlays into the metal body \u2013 are slightly less visible on the back having been shunted to the top, the glass front is the same, with the most obvious change being the lack of a 3.5mm headphone socket in the bottom.</p> <p>It\u2019s a tried and trusted, but ageing design. While other manufacturers have shrunk the bezels around their screens and generally made the display more of the front of the phone, the iPhone has stayed static. That doesn\u2019t mean the build quality or fit and finish is anything other than excellent, but others including Samsung have similar manufacturing prowess.</p> <p>The 4.7in iPhone 7 is 7.1mm thick and 138g (5g lighter than the iPhone 6S), while rival the 5.1in Samsung Galaxy S7 is 7.9mm thick and weighs 152g and Huawei\u2019s 5in P9 is 7mm thick and weighs 144g.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d9a784f06f5badca24e8ab1c34d7a8ec76d6fcba\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d9a784f06f5badca24e8ab1c34d7a8ec76d6fcba/0_0_2882_1730/1000.jpg\" alt=\"iPhone 7 review\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The sim card tray now has a rubber gasket around it to stop water ingress.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The iPhone 7 is now waterproof to IP67 standards, which means up to 1m deep in fresh water for up to 30 minutes. In comparison, Samsung\u2019s Galaxy S7 is rated to IP68 standards, which are at least 1.5m deep for at least 30 minutes. It means that while going swimming with the iPhone 7 isn\u2019t recommended, it will survive a drop into the washing up bowl or down the toilet. And you can wash it.</p> <ul> <li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/sep/08/how-waterproof-iphone-7-samsung-galaxy-s7-smartwatches\"><strong>How waterproof are the iPhone 7, Samsung Galaxy S7 and smartwatches?</strong></a></li> </ul> <p>The screen\u2019s colour and brightness is excellent for an LCD. It isn\u2019t quite as vibrant with deep inky blacks as some high-end OLED screens fitted to Samsung devices, neither is it as pixel dense as all Apple\u2019s rivals or even the iPhone 7 Plus, meaning it isn\u2019t as pin-sharp and you can see the individual pixels. It is better than last year\u2019s model and feels as good as LCD can get.</p> <p>The 4.7in screen is also quite small for today\u2019s smartphones and makes some things a bit fiddly on poorly optimised websites. Not anywhere near as fiddly as the 4in iPhone SE of course. The small size also means that it\u2019s relatively easy to keep hold of compared to the big-screen phablets with displays over 5.5in.</p> <p>New for this year is a pair of stereo speakers, one of which is the front-facing earpiece loudspeaker, the other the bottom-firing speaker from previous models. Together they are louder, but lack any sort of stereo separation and couldn\u2019t be described as room-filling.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8522adfa34f2d002345408c4ea50b615f4a9dcc0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8522adfa34f2d002345408c4ea50b615f4a9dcc0/0_0_3089_1854/1000.jpg\" alt=\"iPhone 7 review\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The antenna lines have been shunted to the top only and are much less visible on the black models.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Specifications</h2> <ul> <li><strong>Screen: </strong>4.7in 1334x750 (326ppi)</li> <li><strong>Processor:</strong> Apple A10 Fusion</li> <li><strong>RAM: </strong>2GB of RAM</li> <li><strong>Storage: </strong>32/128/256GB</li> <li><strong>Operating system: </strong>iOS 10</li> <li><strong>Camera: </strong>12MP rear camera, 7MP front-facing camera</li> <li><strong>Connectivity: </strong>LTE, Wi-Fiac, NFC, IR, Bluetooth 4.2, Lightning and GPS</li> <li><strong>Dimensions: </strong>138.3 x 67.1 x 7.1mm</li> <li><strong>Weight:</strong> 138g</li> </ul> <h2>Snappy performance</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"aebd6364067ac219860bf48d432ae492c6ee03bc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/aebd6364067ac219860bf48d432ae492c6ee03bc/0_0_3097_1859/1000.jpg\" alt=\"iPhone 7 review Lightning only\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">iPhone 7 review Lightning only</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The iPhone 7 has Apple\u2019s latest processor the A10 Fusion, which, like most processors used in Android smartphones, has four processing cores split into two pairs. One is a high-performance pair of cores the other is a pair of energy efficient cores.</p> <p>When the user does something demanding, such as 3D gaming, photo processing or similar, the two big cores fire up, but when just chewing through email or sending a text the two power efficient cores run the show. The idea is that most of the time only the more power efficient cores are required, which helps extend battery life but doesn\u2019t sacrifice performance.</p> <p>The iPhone 7 is snappy, feeling slightly faster than the iPhone 6S in general use. Some things, such as photo processing, particularly in something like Prisma, are also faster. It chews through games without issue and is capable of dealing with pretty much everything you could throw at it. iOS 10 also feels faster, with more quick actions, which helps the phone feel faster.</p> <h2>Battery anxiety</h2> <p>Battery life, however, is poor. Using it as my primary device with three hours of app usage and browsing, hundreds of emails and push notifications, a couple of photos, five hours of music over Bluetooth headphones and the odd game of Jetpack Joyride during my one hour and 20 minute train commute to and from work, it lasted an average of just over 14 hours between charges, meaning it didn\u2019t survive past 9.30pm.</p> <p>Rather than having better battery life in my testing, the iPhone 7 has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/oct/06/apple-iphone-6s-review-camera-3d-touch-screen-faster-processor-fingerprint-sensor-rubbish-battery-life\">worse battery life than the iPhone 6S when new</a>. No single app caused significant battery drain, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/feb/08/uninstalling-facebook-app-saves-iphone-battery-life\">I do not have the Facebook app installed</a> and Low Power Mode made no appreciable difference in my testing when enabled at 20%.</p> <p>If I had needed it to navigate me home or snap some pictures at night I would have to make sure I did a good charge before leaving the office. If I used it for maps for any walking or driving, battery life was much shorter. </p> <p>To get through 24 hours, you\u2019ll be forced to have a power adapter close by, shove it in a battery pack or charge at your desk, which means you won\u2019t be able listen to music at the same time via cabled headphones \u2013 more on that later.</p> <p>To make matters worse, the iPhone 7 has the worst of all worlds: short battery life and tediously slow charging. Even using the 12W charger that came with the iPad Pro it took well over two hours to fully charge the iPhone 7.</p> <h2>iOS 10</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f7b67c40bb221fdb2c8f1aa6b98d5ca1f48d2c05\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f7b67c40bb221fdb2c8f1aa6b98d5ca1f48d2c05/0_0_4696_2818/1000.jpg\" alt=\"iPhone 7 review\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Widgets are the new hotness in iOS 10.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Every year Apple releases a new version of iOS for its newest iPhone and older models. This year\u2019s iOS 10 makes some significant changes to the usability of the software, modernising its approach to notifications, which have become the lifeblood of our increasingly connected world. It follows <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/aug/22/android-7-nougat-review-battery-life-multitasking-operation-notifications-facial-recognition-android\">the approach taken by Google\u2019s Android</a>.</p> <p>Notifications are now rich, with previews and quick replies, speeding up the whole experience. Tap to launch the app, press to pop up a quick preview or widget with options to reply, delete or similar. You can also clear all notifications by pressing on the clear button, rather than be limited to clearing a day at a time.</p> <p>Widgets are now a much bigger thing on the iPhone. The left-most pane on the home screen or the lockscreen now shows a bunch of widgets that were confined to the pull down shade before. While many of them feel superfluous it\u2019s worth curating them to create an at-a-glance screen full of information like the current weather conditions, your next appointment, whether your commute is going to be a nightmare, that kind of thing.</p> <p>Widgets also show up when you force press on an icon of certain apps, along with a load of quick settings. They\u2019re still available in the pull-down shade too.</p> <p>While most of the changes have made the software experience faster, the two-pane Control Centre does not. You have to swipe between quick settings and music controls, which were combined on one pane in iOS 9.</p> <p>It remembers which pane you last used, but isn\u2019t smart enough to go back to quick settings when you\u2019re not playing music. Also, while you can press on the torch icon to change the intensity of the beam, you can\u2019t do the same for Wi-Fi, Bluetooth or Do not disturb. You can\u2019t even get to the Settings app from Control Centre. You have to bounce back to the home screen and launch the app.</p> <p>iOS is now starting to look and feel a bit dated compared with what Google is doing with Android, which is a bit of a role reversal for the two companies. But if you liked iOS on pretty much any other iPhone before, you\u2019ll love this, because it\u2019s the same just with 3D touch functions if you\u2019re upgrading from something older than an iPhone 6S.</p> <h2>Touch ID, Home button and Taptic Engine</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"304107767229b3d76673195dc23138539403fba1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/304107767229b3d76673195dc23138539403fba1/0_0_4515_2709/1000.jpg\" alt=\"iPhone 7 review\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The home button doesn\u2019t move and which it doesn\u2019t feel like a traditional home button, the Taptic Engine really does make it feel like the whole of the bottom half of the phone depresses like a giant single mouse button.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The fingerprint scanner is the same as that fitted to the iPhone 6S and is fast and accurate, although not quite the best in the industry. The home button, however, has changed.</p> <p>Instead of being a real button it\u2019s now a pressure sensitive pad. It doesn\u2019t depress, but you have to push it rather than tap it to activate it as a home button. In response to your pressure there\u2019s a little haptic feedback, which is more taping than vibration.</p> <p>It doesn\u2019t feel anything like pressing the old home button, more like pressing the mouse button on a Magic Mouse or Apple\u2019s Magic Trackpad; it feels like the whole end of the phone depresses.</p> <p>Apple first used the technology in its MacBook laptop for the solid-state trackpad. It didn\u2019t move but the little Taptic Engine made it feel like it did. The home button isn\u2019t anywhere near as good a replication of the original home button\u2019s feel. Some will love it, some will hate it, most will just get on with it.</p> <p>The Taptic Engine as a whole, for notifications and general feedback, such as the little taps as you scroll through the timer\u2019s wheel like notches on something mechanical, is excellent. It is genuinely the best thing Apple has created in years.</p> <h2>Camera</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bf453d57514d8c9b2b31475be12639385657dd25\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bf453d57514d8c9b2b31475be12639385657dd25/0_0_3136_1882/1000.jpg\" alt=\"iPhone 7 review\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The single camera on the back of the iPhone 7 now has optical image stabilisation and is a big step up over previous models.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The iPhone 7\u2019s camera is greatly improved over the iPhone 6S. It has a much faster, brighter f/1.8 lens, optical image stabilisation and takes photos that are a lot sharper even for shaking hands.</p> <p>Images produced in good light are fairly detailed, but can often be a bit dull and washed out while not being quite pin-sharp in some areas losing fine detail in the process. Low-light performance is much improved over the iPhone 6 and 6S, while no fancy software is needed to create pleasing bokeh effects as a shallow depth of field is a function of the f/1.8 lens. The rear camera is one of the best available, but not quite the best, outperformed on fine detail by Samsung\u2019s Galaxy S7 series.</p> <p>The front-facing 7-megapixel selfie camera is one of the best in the business, creating detail rich and colour accurate photos even under difficult artificial lightning conditions.</p> <h2>Headphone jack</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"50a90736c271da43c816bea49ddd58fdfeb85a98\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/50a90736c271da43c816bea49ddd58fdfeb85a98/0_0_4297_2578/1000.jpg\" alt=\"iPhone 7 review\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">To listen to music you\u2019ll need wireless headphones or you can use the included Lightning EarPods or the Lightning to 3.5mm adapter.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The iPhone 7 will be remembered for Apple killing the headphone jack. Straight up: the removal of the 3.5mm headphone socket is not a good thing. It makes it harder to use the phone with conventional headphones and it seems unnecessary.</p> <p>How much the loss will affect you depends on what you use to listen to music on your smartphone. If it\u2019s just Apple\u2019s EarPods - which have absolutely no isolation and are pretty average on sound quality - then you won\u2019t notice when listening to your phone. The Lightning socket works fine, the only problem is the cable doesn\u2019t twist, so I ended up with twisting cords and you <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/sep/09/iphone-7-listen-music-charge-adapter-headphones\">can\u2019t charge and listen to your iPhone 7</a>, say at your desk in an open-plan office.</p> <p>The problem comes when you try to plug the new EarPods included in the box into anything else, because you can\u2019t. Your computer doesn\u2019t have a Lightning socket, neither does your stereo, your TV or Game Boy, which may have found a new spot in your life post Pok\u00e9mon Go.</p> <p>Instead you can forget the Lightning EarPods and use a Lightning to 3.5mm adapter - one is included in the box - for your normal, analogue headphones. If they have an iPhone-compatible in-line controller, volume and pause/play commands are passed through using the adapter.</p> <p>The Lighting-to-3.5mm has a digital-to-analogue converter embedded in it, which makes your headphones reliant on Apple\u2019s cheapest accessory costing \u00a39, thankfully it sounds decent, if a little heavier on the bass than the headphone socket on the iPhone 6S.</p> <p>Better is to go Bluetooth. I cut the cable about five years ago and haven\u2019t looked back. Most Bluetooth headphones come with an optional 3.5mm cable, so you can plug them into your computer easily and just rely on Bluetooth for the phone.</p> <p>Bluetooth earbuds, however, are a more difficult proposition. There are some decent ones with a small cable linking the pair, but completely wireless earbuds are a bit hit and miss. Most struggle to maintain a connection between your ears. Hopefully that\u2019ll be solved in the near future. Apple has a set planned, but the AirPods are essentially EarPods without the cable and so will likely have the same acoustic characteristics.</p> <p>You can record audio using a phone mic or pickup plugged into the Lightning to 3.5mm adapter, but for some you\u2019ll end up with two adapters plugged into each other just to record audio.</p> <h2>Observations</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"316fa88d17b3af78974503669ae1a085ea55fec0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/316fa88d17b3af78974503669ae1a085ea55fec0/386_240_2940_1764/1000.jpg\" alt=\"iPhone 7 review\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Fluffy gets stuck in the antenna bands on the back, which you probably wouldn\u2019t notice on a silver phone, but sticks out like a sore thumb on back.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <ul> <li>The matt black colour looks good but appears a bit like plastic until you touch it<br></li> <li>The matt metal body is pretty slippery to hold, but doesn\u2019t slide off tables<br></li> <li>The home button <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/sep/19/iphone-7-home-button-gloves-sports-armbands\">needs skin contact to work</a>, rendering sport armbands and some touchscreen gloves useless<br></li> <li>You can\u2019t unlock the phone without first activating the Home button<br></li> <li>Bluetooth performance is better, holding a more stable connection with less interference with relatively weak devices such as wireless earbuds than the iPhone 6S and some competitors<br></li> <li>With the antenna lines the most hidden and the screen black when off, the matt black colour is the best-looking<br></li> <li>The jet black glossy finish scratches relatively easy, so to keep it looking like new you\u2019ll need a case</li> <li>The new antenna bands trap fluff in them, which is very difficult to remove</li> </ul> <h2>Price</h2> <p>The iPhone 7 costs \u00a3599 for 32GB (<a href=\"http://go.theguardian.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.johnlewis.com%2Fapple-iphone-7-ios-10-4-7-4g-lte-sim-free-32gb%2Fp2999556%3Fsku%3D237087204%26s_kwcid%3D2dx92700027609496618%26tmad%3Dc%26tmcampid%3D2%26gclid%3DEAIaIQobChMIieCDm_Kp1wIVEQ8YCh0PAwtCEAQYASABEgLnuPD_BwE%26gclsrc%3Daw.ds&amp;id=114047X1572903\">buy here</a>), \u00a3699 for 128GB (<a href=\"http://go.theguardian.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.johnlewis.com%2Fapple-iphone-7-ios-10-4-7-4g-lte-sim-free-128gb%2Fp2999562&amp;id=114047X1572903\">buy here</a>) or \u00a3799 for 256GB in rose gold, gold, silver, black or jet black (<a href=\"http://go.theguardian.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.currys.co.uk%2Fgbuk%2Fphones-broadband-and-sat-nav%2Fmobile-phones-and-accessories%2Fmobile-phones%2Fapple-iphone-7-silver-256-gb-10151581-pdt.html%3FistCompanyId%3Dbec25c7e-cbcd-460d-81d5-a25372d2e3d7%26istItemId%3Dxxrtwawqwa%26istBid%3Dtztx%26srcid%3D198%26cmpid%3Dppc~gg~0061%2B%2528PLA%2529%2BMOBILE%2BPHONES~0061%2B%2528PLA%2529%2BMOBILE%2BPHONES%2Bad%2Bgroup~Exact%26mctag%3Dgg_goog_7904%26kwid%3DGOOGLE%26device%3Dc%26ds_kids%3D92700027233261492%26PLA%3D1%26tgtid%3D0061%2B%2528PLA%2529%2BMOBILE%2BPHONES%26gclid%3DEAIaIQobChMIytOjrPap1wIVgYKyCh2ARgL1EAQYAyABEgJnePD_BwE%26gclsrc%3Daw.ds%26dclid%3DCKffxtP2qdcCFQ6t7QoddKAMgg&amp;id=114047X1572903\">buy here</a>).</p> <p>For comparison, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/apr/27/htc-10-review-up-there-with-samsungs-best\">HTC 10 costs \u00a3570</a>, the 32GB Samsung Galaxy S7 costs \u00a3500, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/may/11/lg-g5-review-power-users-friend-that-just-misses-mark\">LG G5 costs \u00a3500</a>, the 32GB <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/apr/18/huawei-p9-review-smartphone-leica-camera-fingerprint-scanner-emui-software\">Huawei P9 costs \u00a3449</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/apr/13/apple-iphone-se-review-too-small-for-most-people\">16GB iPhone SE costs \u00a3359</a> and last year\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/oct/06/apple-iphone-6s-review-camera-3d-touch-screen-faster-processor-fingerprint-sensor-rubbish-battery-life\">iPhone 6S cost \u00a3539</a> now \u00a3499 for 32GB of storage.</p> <h2>Verdict</h2> <p>The iPhone 7 is a missed opportunity.

  "<p>If I ate only animals I killed myself, I would live on a rather uninspiring diet of clothes moths and the occasional mosquito. But then I haven\u2019t learned to stalk and shoot and fish, unlike Louise Gray, an environmental reporter who followed the example of Facebook\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/green-living-blog/2011/may/27/mark-zuckerberg-kill-animals-meat\">Mark Zuckerberg</a> and decided to eat only what she had personally murdered for a year.</p> <p>In her very likable and often eye-opening book, Gray, \u201ca farmer\u2019s daughter\u201d, spends a surprising amount of time describing visits to various abattoirs, in order to depict exactly what happens when you don\u2019t kill your own food. Dressing for her first visit, she reports wryly, \u201cI wore a new blouse from Topshop with startled fawns on it.\u201d</p> <p>It turns out that even the highest humane standards in such places do not exactly make them pleasant environments, and Gray evokes them with a calm precision. \u201cYou always go backwards in an abattoir, from the packing plant, to the boning hall, to the killing hall, to the lairage. It is to avoid contamination.\u201d</p> <p>Outside the slaughterhouse, author and reader can both breathe more easily as she meets someone who is into collecting and cooking roadkill, and Gray herself kills a variety of wildlife, including a lobster, various fish and game birds, some rabbits, a sheep, a pig and a deer. It is bloody work, carefully described. And what Gray then makes of them in the kitchen does sound mouthwatering.</p> <p>As usual when people talk at any length about food, however, a fair amount of rhetorical bad faith is also going on here. Everyone, including the author, is keen to assert their tremendous \u201crespect\u201d for an animal once it is dead, even though this respect mysteriously didn\u2019t stretch as far as deciding not to kill it when it was still alive. Killing your own animals, Gray says, is \u201cbeyond intimate. It is primal.\u201d Well, yes: so is caving another human being\u2019s skull in with a rock, but that doesn\u2019t mean we should all go around doing it. Most wince-inducing, Gray writes repeatedly of her \u201cgratitude\u201d to birds or mammals she has just slaughtered by firearm or knife (without stunning them first, as abattoirs do) \u2013 as though the beasts had generously volunteered to lay down their lives in order to grace her dinner plate.</p> <p>Luckily the book has charm and style as well. \u201cVegan cheese destroys the soul,\u201d Gray asserts quite persuasively at one point; while after a shooting party she reports, with an interesting mixture of emotions: \u201cMy hands smell of expensive soap and gunpowder.\u201d The accounts of hunting trips with her father contain some vivid and quite moving nature writing and she makes some good points about the blandness of industrialised meat. Scoffing her own pig, she reports: \u201cIt tastes of pig, it smells of pig, it is a pig \u2026 I feel like we have been tricked into eating more pork than we need to in modern life by making it taste like nothing.\u201d If you want a book that wallows in its own sentimentality, moral superiority and superficiality of thinking, you\u2019d better read Jonathan Safran Foer\u2019s <em>Eating Animals </em>instead. (But really, don\u2019t bother.)</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/sep/18/ethical-carnivore-how-to-be-a-guilt-free-meat-eater\">The Ethical Carnivore: 'I no longer feel we should all visit a slaughterhouse'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cI realise I have a message,\u201d Gray announces at the end of the book. \u201cIt is this: you don\u2019t have to kill animals yourself, but you should go to the effort to find out where they come from.\u201d Fair enough. Doing so, she believes, will \u201cnaturally encourage\u201d us to eat less meat. So what do you call this sort of diet? The word \u201cflexitarian\u201d sounds to me like a commitment to eat only animals that practised yoga while alive. Gray just calls it \u201cthe human way to eat\u201d, but this does unfortunately imply that the great unwashed masses who like to scoff a dodgily sourced kebab after midnight are somehow less than human.</p> <p>She ends hopefully with the conviction that we are going into a reduced-meat future, but the problem she doesn\u2019t address is what philosophers call moral incontinence: the fact that, as flawed human beings, we can know what\u2019s right without actually doing it. Gray offers many strong ethical and ecological arguments for eating less meat, and then wonders why people still eat such a lot of it, even though the \u201cfacts and figures are all there\u201d. But a person can be intellectually convinced of facts and figures and still gobble steak or pork in the evening. To change this phenomenon globally is probably going to require more than a few friendly chats with one\u2019s Islington butcher. In the meantime, being told in this book that chickens \u201chave better numeracy skills than toddlers\u201d is not going to deter me from giving the conveniently ready-killed free-range bird in my fridge a damn good roasting.</p> <p><em>\u2022 The Ethical Carnivore: My Year Killing to Eat </em>is published by Bloomsbury.

  "<p>Late in the evening on <a href=\"http://www.thelocal.dk/20160901/christiania-shooting-what-we-know\">Wednesday 31 August</a>, gunshots were fired in the centre of Christiania, Copenhagen\u2019s semi-autonomous freetown. Three people were injured, including one police officer, who remains in critical condition. The gunman \u2013 a 25-year-old Dane who was later shot and killed by the police \u2013 is believed to have been involved in Christiania\u2019s hash trade.</p> <p>Cannabis has long been sold and enjoyed in this unique neighbourhood, a famous utopian commune in the heart of Denmark\u2019s capital. Historically a centre of freedom and resistance, it will celebrate on Monday the <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/events/1264209596945674/\">45th anniversary</a> of the day that squatters \u2013 known as <em>slumstormerene</em> \u2013 broke down the barricades of an abandoned military base, creatively activating disused spaces in a time when living conditions were poor. In 1973, the Social Democratic government gave Christiania the official temporary status of \u201csocial experiment\u201d \u2013 a term that many criticised as its residents had not agreed to participate. Nonetheless, this ruling allowed Christiania to persist, and a majority vote in parliament in 1989 set the Christiania Law in stone, legalising the squat.</p> <p>Stroll beyond \u201cdowntown\u201d Christiania, with its bars, cafes, shops and performance venues, and you\u2019ll stumble across the things that make the community unique. Residents have renovated old barracks, adapting them into practical spaces such as houses, kindergartens, workshops and cafes; they have built their own <a href=\"http://www.dac.dk/en/learning/netundervisning/arksite-kanon/vaerker/christiania/\">avant garde homes</a>; and in the birthplace of the iconic <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/bike-blog/2011/feb/01/cargo-bike-bullitt-cetma-christiania\">Christiania cargo bike</a>, the streets are completely void of cars.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9ace7fe3ae868d045a767778956c7d8f45bf0d0c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9ace7fe3ae868d045a767778956c7d8f45bf0d0c/43_122_2893_1736/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Christiania\u2019s Pusher Street.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Christiania\u2019s Pusher Street.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Athlyn Cathcart-Keays/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The community also has its own social services in cooperation with the municipality, known as Herfra og Videre (Onwards and Upwards), as well as a health centre. With the exception of schools, hospitals and social services, Christiania likes to do things its own way. It has established a self-administrating system that spends 29m kroner (\u00a33.3m) annually on maintaining common property, kindergartens, sewers, recycling and waste collection.</p> <p>Drug use was always a part of the community. In recent years, however, the cannabis trade has evolved. Once led by small-time dealers, it is now controlled by large, multinational organisations, including the Danish branch of the <a href=\"http://politiken.dk/indland/ECE3279470/hells-angels-rocker-doemmes-for-hash-i-christiania/\">Hell\u2019s Angels</a>, who are neither residents nor employees of Christiania. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Controlled legalisation would be a better way to regulate the cannabis market than the current prohibition</p> <footer> <cite>Frank Jensen</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cThis transition has happened over many years,\u201d says Risenga Manghezi, a community spokesperson who has lived in Christiania for seven years. \u201cIn the last 10 to 15 years, the police have been really hard on Pusher Street. This means the softer \u2018mom-and-pop shops\u2019 have disappeared, and it\u2019s only the ones who are most willing to take risks and manipulate Christianites who have stayed.\u201d </p> <p>Recent figures from the Copenhagen police estimate that between <a href=\"https://www.dr.dk/nyheder/politik/politi-svaert-komme-hashhandel-paa-christiania-til-livs\">up to 1bn</a> kroner (\u00a3115m) changes hands each year in Pusher Street.</p> <p>\u201cToday you have pre-rolled joints, different types of hash,\u201d says Manghezi. \u201cIt\u2019s all very systemised and there is a lot of money going through there.\u201d</p> <p>In this otherwise semi-autonomous and socially minded community, a capitalist-style \u201cdrugs supermarket\u201d had developed, and was spinning out of control \u2013 culminating in the recent shootout. \u201cThis was something most of us knew could happen,\u201d Manghezi says. \u201cIt\u2019s not the first time somebody\u2019s been shot in Christiania. But I\u2019ve always thought that the day a police officer gets shot, that\u2019s the day things will get really bad.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"ab498cd6bd40aed620e04e8a955ecc15412a67cc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ab498cd6bd40aed620e04e8a955ecc15412a67cc/0_74_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A Christiania resident demolishes a cannabis stall following the shooting.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A Christiania resident demolishes a cannabis stall following last month\u2019s shooting.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Scanpix Denmark/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Indeed, the next evening, roughly 400 of Christiania\u2019s 700 adult residents gathered in the community\u2019s meeting space. The democratic process in Christiania is based on a <a href=\"http://www.seedsforchange.org.uk/consensus\">consensus mechanism</a>, and cannabis sellers are often present at community meetings: to have a hash stall in Christiania, you must be a resident. </p> <p>Some gangs, however, have manipulated locals into acting as a front for their trade. Their presence at meetings, Manghezi laments, makes it difficult to build momentum to change the way Pusher Street is run. But this time it was clear something drastic would happen: by the end of the meeting, residents had decided to <a href=\"http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/christianas-marijuana-selling-booths-are-torn-down-after-shooting-1579398\">demolish all stalls in the \u201ccannabis supermarket\u201d</a> and reclaim the area from outside dealers.</p> <p>\u201cThe whole vibe around Pusher Street has really sucked a lot of the energy out of Christiania. This has been a wakeup call for what we have here,\u201d says Manghezi. \u201cPolice confrontation around Pusher Street has halted a lot of the great things that could go on. I hope that what we\u2019ve done will now release some new energy so we can focus on the cool things happening.\u201d </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"05245b137d6f4667434659a2e2f0b9732e0a6f3c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/05245b137d6f4667434659a2e2f0b9732e0a6f3c/428_274_1970_2462/800.jpg\" alt=\"Ole Lykke.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ole Lykke.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Athlyn Cathcart-Keays</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Since the stalls were destroyed, the atmosphere is noticeably different: pop-up community meals have taken place, and there is talk of plans for a fountain. There have always been a lot of positive lessons to learn from this alternative urban enclave. The community continuously experiments with green building techniques, stormwater management, solar energy and water-treatment systems to reduce their ecological footprint. Christiania\u2019s creativity and experimentation has always existed, but the presence of Pusher Street has dominated the focus. \u201cIt has made people sort of not talk about the social experiment,\u201d says Manghezi. \u201cIt\u2019s given the general feeling that things we do here are illegal \u2013 they really aren\u2019t!\u201d</p> <p>This freedom to experiment is at the core of Christiania\u2019s principles. When resident and archivist Ole Lykke first moved to the freetown in 1979, he says, \u201cyou\u2019d have a good idea, you\u2019d go ahead with it, and if somebody complained, you\u2019d deal with it. If not, then you\u2019d just go ahead.\u201d </p> <p>But <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/apr/28/christiania-copenhagen-squat-last-stand\">in 2011</a>, their principles were threatened when the Danish government insisted that Christiania either purchase the land or be bought out. Because of Christianites\u2019 rejection of property rights, the prospect of ownership was unappealing. So they set up a foundation to buy the land. Many supporters of the commune jumped at the chance to \u201c<a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrrHWLSsmIc\">buy a little share of freedom</a>\u201d, more than 12.5m kroner was raised, a mortgage was secured and Christiania <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://cphpost.dk/news/local-news/christiania-accepts-beautiful-agreement.html\">was saved</a>. </p> <p>The mortgage payments rise every year, but this \u201crent\u201d is immensely cheaper than the rest of central Copenhagen \u2013 giving Christiania \u201cthe perfect elements for gentrification\u201d, says Manghezi. Autonomous or not, Christiania faces the same challenges as many inner-city neighbourhoods when it comes to the pressures of market forces.</p> <p>Just across the water, in an area known as Papir\u00f8en (Paper Island), a former paper factory is being colonised by a food market, a gallery and design offices, preparing the area for transformation <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.citylab.com/cityfixer/2016/02/copenhagen-paper-island-waterfront-redevelopment-creative-business-copenhagenize/463137/\">into a luxury development</a>.

Then they would\u2019ve built concrete houses that probably would\u2019ve been torn down by now. We saved this area, and have made an attraction in the city.\u201d</p> <p>Indeed, with up to a million annual visitors, Christiania is the Danish capital\u2019s second most popular attraction. \u201cCopenhagen needs grassroots movements like Christiania because they add new dimensions and dynamics to our culture and urban life,\u201d says the city\u2019s mayor, Frank Jensen. \u201cThe city needs to make room for people that give Copenhagen the edge and contributes to making it stand out, nationally and internationally.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2016/may/05/story-cities-copenhagen-denmark-modernist-utopia\">Story of cities #36: how Copenhagen rejected 1960s modernist 'utopia'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It is increasingly clear, however, that combating the illicit drug trade is key to ensuring Christiania\u2019s survival.

They are trained in escape and evasion and will avoid capture with the help of a network of fellow veterans around the country. They\u2019ve got equipment and terminology, ghillie suits, two-way radios, roger this and eyes on that. \u201cThis is definitely a 100% way of not being caught,\u201d one says of them, riding some kind of six-wheel ATV (that\u2019s an all-terrain vehicle, but you knew that).</p> <p>But they\u2019ve got a couple of big chinks in their amour. First, Kirk might be a battle-hardened, battle-scarred soldier (both he and Jez are amputees), but he\u2019s also a family man and he\u2019s not going to miss his son\u2019s birthday. To be honest, I\u2019m not sure it\u2019s worth it; poor little Archie looks absolutely terrified, taken into the middle of nowhere to meet a talking tree that looks nothing like his daddy and which picks him up for a quick happy birthday hug. If their pursuers had been more on their game, it would have been all over then.</p> <p>Then there\u2019s their cyber naivety. Being tech savvy is more useful than any camouflage suits and ATVs. And Kirk has left all sorts of priceless information on his phone, iPad and laptop which are taken in and hacked into. Also Jez\u2019s email. The hunters are on to them, they\u2019ve got cell-site monitoring on the phone of a lady called Karen who is driving them to an Indian restaurant in Blackpool for lunch. And here they are, eyes on, tucking into a chicken korma, I\u2019d say definitely 100% they\u2019re about to be caught ...</p> <p>What?! After going into Mr Basrai\u2019s to check they\u2019ve got the right men, the ground team go back out to wait for them in the street. Kirk and Jez spot them, have a word with the waiter, escape out the back. That\u2019s an elementary mistake, isn\u2019t it, on the part of the hunters? Who the hell are these clowns, and is the country safe with people like them in charge? Or, seen another way, maybe there is hope for the individual against the state after all.</p> <p>It\u2019s reality TV, not actual reality; some of the powers of the state \u2013 including CCTV and automatic number-plate recognition \u2013 have been replicated. But it\u2019s easy to forget, especially for the Hunted themselves, for whom it looks properly scary. It\u2019s an interesting social experiment, about how people react to pressure. It does ask questions about the balance between security and freedom, Big Brother Britain. Plus it\u2019s a thriller, a bloody good chase.</p> <p>Ew, there\u2019s quite an alarming opening to <strong>Paranoid</strong> (ITV). A happy rural kids\u2019 playground scene is brutally interrupted when a twitching hoodie lurches in and stabs a mum to death, as she pushes her toddler on the swing.</p> <p>The chief suspect, a psychopathic schizophrenic, is later found dead himself, having apparently committed suicide. Did he really jump though? Did he even kill GP mum Angela?</p> <p>The police are totally out of their depth. Bobby (Robert Glenister) is having panic attacks, and seeks comfort with the main witness (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/lesley-sharp\">Lesley Sharp</a>). Office loudmouth Nina (Indira Varma) is dumped by her boyfriend, has a ticking-clock no-baby crisis, isn\u2019t really fully focused on the case. Alec (Dino Fetscher) \u2026 well, I\u2019m not sure what to make of him. Or indeed any of it to be honest.</p> <p>It\u2019s an odd one, this. It doesn\u2019t really add up or hang together. Ostensibly a conspiracy thriller, but am I supposed to be sitting on the edge of my seat, chewing my knuckles, looking over my shoulder, laughing even? Or caring about any of these unlikable people? After the arresting first scene, I\u2019m not really doing any of these things.</p>",
  "<p>Protesters and police in Charlotte confronted each other for a third evening, on Thursday night, in a roaming demonstration as the family of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/22/keith-scott-video-charlotte-police-shooting\">police shooting victim Keith Scott</a> said it still had \u201cmore questions than answers\u201d after privately viewing footage of his killing.</p> <p>Police used tear gas to disperse a crowd of hundreds on the John Belk freeway, where they had blocked traffic.

It\u2019s important for all of us to say we want to get this right.\u201d</p> <p>On the streets overnight, police took a decidedly different approach Thursday night to the night before; instead of a large, central phalanx, they and National Guardsmen stood in small groups on every street corner. They wore no riot gear, and kept a low profile, letting the crowds march throughout the neighborhood.</p> <p>At the site where protester Justin Carr, 26, was injured during the upheaval Wednesday night, visitors left tokens memorial, lit candles and sang. </p> <p>There were signs the authorities were ready for violence. Helicopters swung around the downtown sky and Humvee vehicles stayed tucked on side streets. But on the central downtown blocks, police rode in golf carts and on bicycles.</p> <p>Several local pastors engaged people on the sidewalks, interrupting arguments that seemed near overheating. </p> <p>Eunice Lowe, 61, had a close-up view on both nights. She lives on a bench near the intersection of Tryon and Trade streets, where she put out a small hand-painted Black Lives Matter sign. </p> <p>\u201cLast night I thought I might go deaf,\u201d she said, referring to the flash-bang projectiles and tear gas canisters.</p> <p>She was saddened to hear that Carr, who was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/22/north-carolina-protester-dies-keith-scott-police-shooting\">injured on her block</a>, had died. \u201cNo, no,\u201d she said. </p> <p>As the crowd dissolved downtown on Thursday night, a new one gathered on the freeway, where protesters stopped cars.

  "<p>Building a viable business normally necessitates growth, yet many small business owners are deciding against scaling up. They are intentionally keeping their enterprises small, manageable or locally-focused.</p> <p>Genevieve Brading, founder of online needlework business <a href=\"http://www.flossandmischief.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Floss &amp; Mischief</a> has no intention to expand. \u201cFor some people, success in business means leasing an office, payrolling staff and getting into bed with investors, but I can\u2019t think of anything worse,\u201d she says. \u201cI set up on my own to escape office culture, answer to myself only and invent my own work-life balance, so the idea of growing the business by investing in all those corporate trappings is totally counter-intuitive.\u201d<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"90d590828e3630fcd86d3b57df567a1c0c66f89d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/90d590828e3630fcd86d3b57df567a1c0c66f89d/0_503_3168_3960/800.jpg\" alt=\"woman sewing\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Genevieve Brading set-up her business to escape corporate life.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Floss &amp; Mischief/Lydia Shalet</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There are good commercial reasons for limiting growth, says Derek Irvine, a small business consultant with <a href=\"http://www.businessdoctors.co.uk/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Business Doctors</a>, a national network of business coaches. \u201cIt makes sense to stay small and specialised if your company is based around repeat and referral business or if market uncertainty exposes you to price volatility.\u201d Irvine says this is because larger organisations struggle to adapt and move as swiftly as well-managed small businesses. \u201cTypically SMEs are very close to their markets and can adapt to changes,\u201d he adds. </p> <p>Staying small can also mean staying in control. Irvine says it is quite common for SME owners who have experienced growth to want to downsize. \u201cDownsizing is attractive when the business owner is no longer enjoying being at the behest of too many demanding clients. Sometimes their margins are being squeezed as they have increased their geographic coverage or introduced one too many new services. Or they want to go back to having a more manageable-sized business, which doesn\u2019t consume so much of their life.\u201d</p> <p>But that can prove complicated for business owners who have previously taken on investment. \u201cBusinesses can fail to recognise that investors are unlikely to be sympathetic to requests to scale back as [the investors] will be seeking to maximise a return on their investment,\u201d says Irvine.<br></p> <p>Choosing not to expand your business can help you avoid costs associated with growth, such as staffing overheads, business tax and larger premises, but Irvine cautions that no business can afford to stand still, and that capping growth can also limit potential.<br></p> <p>\u201cStaying small is a risk in itself. Most <a href=\"http://www.retailresearch.org/whosegonebust.php\" rel=\"nofollow\">startups fail</a> because they lack the ability to grow past this initial lifestyle stage,\u201d he says. \u201cSteady growth is [often] not a realistic option as [rapidly] increased production costs or insufficient [revenue growth] to invest back in the business \u2013 whether that is in staff, products or processes \u2013 can result in early business failure.\u201d <br></p> <p>In February, a survey of 1,500 UK small business owners, conducted by <a href=\"https://business.yell.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Yell Business</a>, found that 62% had not employed anyone new in the past six months and only 14% plan to hire more staff in the next two years. Recruiting isn\u2019t the only way to build a business, of course, but the figures suggest that scaling up isn\u2019t a priority for many small business owners.<br></p> <p>Staying small doesn\u2019t necessarily mean limiting success. Peter Kinsella runs <a href=\"http://lunya.co.uk/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Lunya</a>, an online Spanish deli and Catalonian restaurant with sites in Liverpool and Manchester that employs 97 staff.<br></p> <p>Despite trading well since the business launched in August 2010 and attracting interest from potential investors and financiers, who wanted to fund expansion, Kinsella says it was always his intention to stay small. \u201cIt took us more than five years to open our second site, during which time we ignored advice to open others until we were confident we had achieved the quality and stability to sustain opening one more,\u201d he explains.<br></p> <p>Keeping small has also enabled Lunya to fund the business without taking on outside finance. \u201cThat means we\u2019re not accountable to investors and, as a result, we can make every decision based on what\u2019s in the best interests of ourselves and the business.\u201d<br></p> <p>Limiting growth can help retail and hospitality businesses to control the quality of goods and services. \u201cHospitality is a relationship-based business and staying small affords us close relationships with 50-plus suppliers who know us very well and can tailor what they have to what they know we want,\u201d says Kinsella. It can also mean those running the business really know the customers: \u201cWe\u2019re there every day, shaping everything about the business through face-to-face contact instead of managing via spreadsheets.\u201d<br></p> <p>Amanda Herbert, partner at <a href=\"http://www.syren-strategy.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Syren Strategy</a>, a marketing strategy company, says staying small makes it easier to flex up and down, according to fluctuating business needs and demand, without the strain of committing to ambitious overheads.

Herbert says: \u201cOne of the frustrations we repeatedly heard from clients was that a director would be wheeled in to take a brief but then a totally different team \u2013 very often a really junior one \u2013 would end up working on it with no real understanding of the issues and no consistency.

How do you make that choice?\u201d</p> <p>Tangled up in all this is what Labour people see as one of the most brazen bits of chicanery the Conservatives have ever performed. Towards the end of 2015 Osborne announced <a href=\"http://www.publicfinance.co.uk/news/2015/10/osborne-scraps-core-grant-and-allows-councils-keep-business-rates\" title=\"\">a drastic new policy</a>: by 2020 most central government funding of city and local councils was to be phased out; by way of compensation, local authorities could keep all their business rates income, with a system of \u201ctop-ups and tariffs\u201d to somehow balance things up between places that would be swimming in money, and less thriving areas whose budgets would suddenly contain huge black holes.</p> <p>Osborne also promised new sources of funding for increasingly inadequate social care budgets, though councils <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/nov/26/end-austerity-local-services-osborne-council-cuts\" title=\"\">said these would fall far short of what was needed</a>. No one running our counties and cities seems to have any clue how this will actually work. But by way of easing them into this new world, <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/greg-clark-confirms-historic-4-year-settlement-for-local-government\" title=\"\">\u00a3300m of \u201ctransition\u201d funding was eventually set aside</a>: a relatively trifling sum, but every little helps.</p> <p>Against the background of cuts already falling on richer areas with much less severity, this is where the story gets really grim.

Eight of those 10 have outright Conservative majorities; all are Tory-run. Heading up the list of councils who have not received a penny are the authorities that run Nottingham, Birmingham, Bristol, Leeds, Liverpool, Manchester, Newcastle and Sheffield. All have a Labour majority and councils that have been warning of the impact of austerity for six years.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>'Any politician who affects sympathy with people at the sharp end while overseeing such carnage is guilty of cant'</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The government says that the new funds are being handed out in \u201cdirect proportion\u201d to particular councils\u2019 reductions in support due to changes in the way money is distributed from Whitehall \u2013 but it will not release figures to back that claim up.

In July his last attempt was met with an official response that bordered on the impenetrable, but pithily ended with an insistence that \u201cthe public interest in withholding the information outweighs that in disclosure\u201d. The question of why his city has so lost out, it seems, is none of his business.</p> <p>Looking ahead, there might conceivably be some chance of the new rhetoric from May and Hammond, her chancellor, being reflected in a rolling back of the attacks on local services, and a fairer approach to which savings fall where \u2013 but talk to the people running councils, and you find little optimism. Many are locked into four-year budget agreements with Whitehall, with cuts that extend until 2020.</p> <p>Their worst fears are that everything will worsen when Brexit eventually hits the economy. That prospect, in addition to bafflement at how the changes to their financing are going to work, defines a mood of ever increasing fear, compounded by what shields the people at the top from accountability \u2013 most of the media\u2019s lack of interest in life outside London, and its allergic reaction to the dread term \u201clocal government\u201d.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the cuts machine grinds on.

Earlier estimates from the company <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/may/25/bp-would-need-to-bring-equipment-from-texas-to-contain-south-australia-oil-spill\">suggested it would take 157 days</a>.</p> <p>But <a href=\"https://www.bsee.gov/sites/bsee_prod.opengov.ibmcloud.com/files/federal-register-notice//2016-15699.pdf\">new US regulations</a> for drilling in the Arctic require a relief well to be drilled and completed within 45 days. To achieve that, the company must have access to a nearby rig.</p> <p>BP has not said it will have its own rig nearby in the Bight. Instead, it would borrow one from another company. But it is unclear where such a rig would come from, since there are no other rigs in the Bight.</p> <p>Hopkins told the Guardian it also wasn\u2019t clear how quickly another company could release a rig for this purpose.</p> <p>\u201cThe Gulf of Mexico blowout was stopped in 87 days, during which time it inflicted <a href=\"http://www.cchbooks.com.au/disastrous-decisions-the-human-and-organisational-causes-of-the-gulf-of-mexico-blowout\">damage worth at least $40bn</a>.

BP has said subsea dispersal would begin within 10 days \u201cwhere that is possible\u201d but oil could reach the coast within 9.2 days.</p> <p>\u201cIts published oil spill response plan gives no guarantee that an oil spill in the Bight would not reach the shoreline and damage the environment,\u201d Hopkins said.</p> <p>A spokeswoman for BP said: \u201cIn the very unlikely event that there was a well incident, we would take action immediately, starting from within seconds.

  "<p>A selection of short stories by Henry Lawson was published in 1959 called Fifteen Stories. Australian author Colin Roderick wrote in the introduction:<br></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>[Henry Lawson] never attempted to draw people he did not know \u2026 it was the world of the drover, the prospector, the miner, the rouseabout, the shearer, the railway worker, the swagman and the sundowner, the cocky, the timbergetter, the underpaid apprentice, the bushwoman, the city larrikin, the bushranger, the spieler, the washerwoman, the broken-down gentleman, the unemployed.</p> </blockquote> <p>It seems an exhaustive list. Yet Roderick selected Lawson\u2019s 1892 story The Drover\u2019s Wife for the collection too, and it alone has three Indigenous characters, primarily a lazy, lying \u201cstray blackfella\u201d whose actions bring the stoic frontierswoman to tears. It appears Lawson did attempt to draw people he didn\u2019t know \u2013 Roderick just didn\u2019t see them.</p> <p>In the late 1800s and the late 1950s, it was normal for Indigenous characters in literature to be negatively represented or invisible. It may happen less now but Roderick was right on one count: \u201cThe Australia that Henry Lawson knew ... was the base upon which our society has grown.\u201d </p> <p>In this literary continuum, the post-colonial retelling of The Drover\u2019s Wife by actor and writer Leah Purcell is an important work. It pauses history\u2019s accretion of half-truths and delivers our cherished classics back to us, alive with a new muse. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2016/sep/12/reimagining-the-drovers-wife-leah-purcell-weaves-indigenous-australia-into-classic-tale\">Reimagining The Drover's Wife: Leah Purcell weaves Indigenous Australia into classic tale</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Purcell is a Goa-Gunggari-Wakka Wakka Murri woman. In her version of The Drover\u2019s Wife (in which she plays the titular character), the lying blackfella is reimagined as the honourable Yadaka (Mark Coles Smith) in a co-leading role. Two female Indigenous characters appear only in spirit form or anecdote but are nonetheless crucial to the action . And in a plot twist I won\u2019t spoil, one that spins the entire play on its axis, a fourth Indigenous character looms largest of all. </p> <p>The play has plenty of action. Purcell calls it <a href=\"http://belvoir.com.au/news/writer-director-notes-drovers-wife/\">an Australian western influenced by Deadwood and Django Unchained</a> and while Stephen Curtis\u2019s stage design is minimal \u2013 a dead tree, a wood block, a grubby curtain \u2013 Tess Schofield\u2019s costumes are faithful to the era. </p> <p>The play opens with the drover\u2019s wife in tattered, full skirts pointing a rifle at a black man lying on the ground, possibly dead. She circles him and calls for her dog. Instead, a no-good swagman (Tony Cogin) arrives saying there\u2019s a murderous black felon on the loose. Did I mention the drover\u2019s wife is in labour, wracked by contractions? </p> <p>The black man is Yadaka and he is not dead. Like the drover\u2019s wife, he is an underdog and a survivor: taken as a kid to join a circus, fleeing the horrors of a clan killed by poisoned waterholes and trying to return to his mother\u2019s country across land now criss-crossed with fences. </p> <p>Yadaka and the drover\u2019s wife share stories, at first falteringly, then freely. Before him, her uterine waters splash to the floor; later, useless breast milk darkens her dress. Her body teems with life and death, as women\u2019s bodies do, and Yadaka seems not disgusted but in awe. \u201cIn my tribe you would be treated like a queen,\u201d he says. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"2c2ea4f51f932f98b217ec148107a2ddfb39d261\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2c2ea4f51f932f98b217ec148107a2ddfb39d261/0_0_2362_1575/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Mark Coles-Smith brings gentleness, charisma, optimism and romance to his role as Yadaka.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mark Coles-Smith brings gentleness, charisma, optimism and romance to his role as Yadaka.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Brett Boardman Photography</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cThis is a story about women\u2019s business,\u201d says Aunty Bronwyn Penrith, a Wiradjuri woman and chair of Mudgin-Gal Aboriginal Women\u2019s Corporation, when she opens the play. \u201cAboriginal women, but also colonial women and what they went through.\u201d Her words bring us close to a fresh source of reconciliation. </p> <p>Smith brings so much to his role as Yadaka: gentleness, charisma, optimism and romance. He delivers the script\u2019s most poetic lines with ease. \u201cHer skin oiled with Bogong moth fat, shining like a full moon,\u201d he says of first seeing his wife. \u201cWhen she danced \u2026 smooth like shallow runnin\u2019 water over river rocks.\u201d It\u2019s captivating \u2013 perhaps because I\u2019ve never heard an Aboriginal woman described so beautifully by an Aboriginal man in an Australian play. </p> <p>In Lawson\u2019s story, the wife\u2019s foe is a snake. She also recalls battles with fire, flood, a buffalo and a \u201cgallows-faced swagman\u201d who expresses his \u201cintention to stay the night\u201d. In Purcell\u2019s feminist reworking, men like the swagman are the primary threat. \u201cSnakes, missus,\u201d warns Yadaka. \u201cLeast of my worries,\u201d she snaps back. </p> <p>Director Leticia C\u00e1ceres\u2019s staging works brilliantly to make this point. Ill-willed men pop out from every available entry as though lurking opportunistically in the perimeters all along. A swagman, a peddler (Benedict Hardie) and a trooper all enter, uninvited, from different points. Leading into the most harrowing scene, two drovers inexplicably emerge from the wife\u2019s shanty. Her defences are constantly being breached but this time you feel she is surrounded; done for. My only gripe is all the gun-pointing. Fear of a gunshot does maintain audience tension but it seems a cheap way to do it. </p> <p>We discover her name is Molly. She prefers the drover\u2019s wife, though not out of loyalty. As Lawson wrote, the drover \u201cmay sometimes forget he\u2019s married\u201d \u2013 a flaw that is brutally extrapolated by Purcell. Even with Yadaka by her side \u2013 who wilts into submission every time a white man walks on stage \u2013 the wife is forced to invoke the husband when her sanctuary is threatened. \u201cAnytime now, my Joe be home,\u201d she says and we feel the humiliation of it keenly. </p> <p>There is no flab to Purcell\u2019s script. On a second read (Belvoir is issuing the script with the program and long may the tradition last!) several lines resonate even more deeply. \u201cBury that collar deep\u201d, commands the drover\u2019s wife after they hack off Yadaka\u2019s steel collar with an axe, words symbolic of how Australia has dealt with its black history. She also says: \u201cWhat\u2019s happened here will be heard as I intend it to be heard.\u201d It\u2019s a desire that may or may not pan out for the drover\u2019s wife but it certainly has for Purcell. </p>",
  "<p>The inadequacy of competition and the profit motive in the provision human services like education and health has been established by harsh experience with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/12/face-the-facts-competition-and-profit-dont-work-in-health-education-or-prisons\">consistent failures like PFI hospitals, for-profit schools and private prisons</a>. This failure presents a puzzle: how is it that (assuming we have an adequate income) we can rely on for-profit corporations to put food on our tables and clothes on our backs, but not to educate our children or preserve our health. </p> <p>In the hands of many advocates of privatisation, this puzzle is turned into a knock-down refutation: if the profit motive works well in providing something as vital as food, it must work well everywhere. The latest instance of this naive faith in the market is the Australian <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/sep/22/productivity-commission-calls-to-privatise-public-health-and-housing\">Productivity Commission\u2019s call to privatise public health and housing</a>.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/20/our-hospitals-are-being-privatised-is-anybody-paying-attention\">Our hospitals are being privatised. Is anybody paying attention? | Amy Corderoy</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In fact, there is no puzzle here: economists and public policy scholars worked out decades ago how to answer this question in principle, and solved many of the issues in detail. The problem is that the political class, along with much of the economics profession, have done worse than the Bourbons, of whom Talleyrand observed \u201cthey have learned nothing, and forgotten nothing\u201d. Leading economist Paul Romer recently observed, echoing earlier comments by Robert Gordon, that <a href=\"https://paulromer.net/the-trouble-with-macro/\">macroeconomics has been going backwards</a> since the early 1980s.</p> <p>The same is true of the regressive microeconomics underlying the dogma that privatisation and market competition are always and everywhere beneficial. Our leaders, and the economists who advise them, have shown themselves incapable of learning from experience, but they have forgotten much that we once knew. In this case, what we once knew was the analysis of market failure that supported the successful mixed economy that came into being in the mid-20th century.</p> <p>The basic analytical framework was set out in Francis Bator\u2019s 1958 article, \u201cThe anatomy of market failure\u201d, (itself drawing on earlier work by the great British economist AC Pigou). It was developed further by a string of contributions from economists like Kenneth Arrow, Joseph Stiglitz and George Akerlof, all of whom received the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences for their work.</p> <p>Taken together with Keynesian macroeconomic theory, this body of work explained why a properly functioning modern economy must be one in which some goods and services are provided by firms competing for profit and others by governments or publicly-funded non-profit organisations. The result is the \u201cmixed economy\u201d, political and social aspects of which were analysed by scholars such as Karl Mannheim and Andrew Shonfield.</p> <p>Human services are among the sectors of the economy where markets and competition perform badly. The central problems related to human services involve information and finance. These are most obvious in relation to education. Education is for most of us, a once-only experience, and its value is hard to assess, except in retrospect. To some extent, we can make choices on the basis of the reputation of schools and universities. However, these reputations change only slowly over decades, so slowly that no rational for-profit firm would invest in maintaining them. </p> <p>Moreover, education is hugely expensive, so that most families can\u2019t afford it in the absence of public provision or a public subsidy. The experience of for-profit education in Australia and the US has been that it is far easier to extract public subsidies through scams of various kinds than to compete on the basis of high-quality education.</p> <p>Many of the same issues arise in healthcare. Obviously, if we knew what was wrong with our health and how to fix it, we wouldn\u2019t need doctors to tell us. As it is, we need to rely on the judgment of our doctors to give us the right treatment and, equally importantly, to tell us when we will get better without treatment. The greater the role of profit in the system, the greater the incentive to provide unnecessary or overpriced services. The example of the United States, which spends more on healthcare than any other country, with worse results, is an illustration.</p> <p>Information isn\u2019t a problem, or not much of one, in the case of food supply. We buy food on a weekly or even daily basis and have plenty of chances to determine what we like, and which suppliers offer good value for our money. There are things we can\u2019t easily observe, like the cleanliness of food preparation, but these can be dealt with through regulation rather than through governments getting into the food supply business themselves. </p> <p>Of course, none of this helps if you don\u2019t have enough money to afford the food you need. But long experience has shown that the best way to help poor people afford necessities like food is to give them more money. Neither general food subsidies nor welfare payments tied to food purchases (food stamps) have ever worked as well as income redistribution.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/12/face-the-facts-competition-and-profit-dont-work-in-health-education-or-prisons\">Face the facts: competition and profit don't work in health, education or prisons | John Quiggin</a> </p> </aside>  <p>If markets and profits don\u2019t work well in the provision of human services, why should we expect governments and non-profit organisations to do any better? The answer is that that non-profit provision relies on professionalism and a service ethos. These can\u2019t be combined with reliance on direct financial incentives and managerial control. </p> <p>The Bourbons who have dominated public policy for the past few decades are resolutely hostile to any kind of professional or service ethos. They take for granted the most simplistic versions of textbook economics, in which only monetary incentives matter. On a more sophisticated view of the question, people care just as much about the respect of their peers and belief in the value of their work as they do about the size of their pay packet. </p> <p>This is ultimately an empirical question, and after 30 years of failure we have more than enough evidence to reach a conclusion. Across the human services sector, markets, incentives and competition rarely work better than non-profit provision and frequently lead to disastrous failure.</p>",

  "<p>Donald Trump suggested on Thursday that Hillary Clinton bears responsibility for unrest that has followed police shootings of African Americans, saying she has \u201csupported with a nod\u201d the idea \u201cthat cops are a racist force to our society\u201d.</p> <p>Clinton \u201cshares directly in with the responsibility for the unrest that is afflicting our country,\u201d Trump told a crowd of several thousand in suburban Philadelphia, while the city of Charlotte, North Carolina, braced for a third night of protests following a fatal police shooting of a black man.</p> <p>\u201cRioting in the streets is a threat to all peaceful citizens and it must be ended and it must be ended now,\u201d Trump told the almost entirely white crowd. The Republican nominee dismissed a brief protest against him as the result of a few \u201cviolent disrupters\u201d and pledged: \u201cI am with you and I will fight for you\u201d to \u201claw-abiding African Americans\u201d.</p> <p>Trump\u2019s remarks came as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/22/north-carolina-protester-dies-keith-scott-police-shooting\">police confirmed the death</a> of a protester shot in demonstrations in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/21/protesters-clash-with-police-in-charlotte-after-fatal-shooting-of-black-man\">aftermath of the killing of Keith Scott</a> in Charlotte on Tuesday. Police and Scott\u2019s family have given contradictory accounts of the shooting, with officers alleging he had a gun and family saying he <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/22/keith-scott-video-charlotte-police-shooting\">held a book</a>. After review of dashboard and body camera footage, the police chief and family both told reporters that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/22/north-carolina-protester-dies-keith-scott-police-shooting\">video of the altercation is ambiguous</a>. On Thursday night, however, protesters marched to the chant: \u201cWe want the tapes.\u201d</p> <p>On Thursday Oklahoma prosecutors also <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/22/terence-crutcher-betty-shelby-manslaughter-tulsa\">announced the indictment</a> of a police officer over the fatal shooting of an unarmed African American in Tulsa, Oklahoma.</p> <p>The Republican nominee suggested earlier in the day in Pittsburgh that protesters may have been acting under the influence of narcotics, telling the Shale Insight Convention: \u201cIf you\u2019re not aware, drugs are a very, very big factor in what you\u2019re watching on television.\u201d Trump added that he would have \u201cno compassion for lawless conduct\u201d.</p> <p>Mike Pence, the Republican vice-presidential nominee, <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2016/09/22/politics/charlotte-mike-pence-police-shootings/\">also spoke about the issue</a> on Thursday, telling pastors in Colorado that he disagreed with protesters who have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jul/17/one-year-ago-eric-garner-new-york\">demonstrated against</a> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/apr/27/baltimore-police-protesters-violence-freddie-gray\">police abuses</a> for nearly <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2014/nov/25/violent-civil-unrest-ferguson-grand-jury-decision\">two years</a>. \u201cDonald Trump and I believe that there\u2019s been far too much talk of institutional bias or racism within law enforcement,\u201d Pence said, insisting the issue was resolved. \u201cWe ought to set aside this talk about institutional racism and institutional bias.\u201d</p> <p>The Indiana governor added: \u201cPolice officers are human beings.

Some have been held incommunicado since, with lawyers and family members trying to visit them in detention being told to look elsewhere.</p> <p>Meanwhile, state media has been given exclusive access to parade many activists as criminals on television before their trial. </p> <p>One of the key targets of the crackdown is lawyer Wang Quanzhang.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/17/china-hinkley-point-delay-diplomacy\">What does Theresa May really think about China? | Mary Dejevsky</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Wang has drawn the ire of the government many times for his defence of villagers against corrupt local officials, Falun Gong practitioners and fellow rights activists such as Ni Yulan whose treatment in police custody in 2010 left her confined to a wheelchair.</p> <p>In 2013, Wang was detained during trial for refusing a judge\u2019s illegal demand. This was perhaps the first instance of a rights lawyer being held under a process called judicial detention. Hauling away a lawyer in the middle of defending his client aptly illustrates the barriers to legal aid in China.</p> <p>Following his release, Wang characteristically treated the incident as a learning opportunity and wrote a legal manual on judicial detention for rights defenders. Wang often devoted as much time to assisting other lawyers as he did defending the rights of those who few others dared to represent.</p> <p>For this he has suffered in secret detention for over a year and now faces a show trial on charges of subverting state power.</p> <p>Having known Wang for many years and worked together at China Action until early 2014, we can say he is one of the bravest people we will ever meet. His commitment to the rule of law is unimpeachable. The charges are baseless.</p> <p>State security has explained that Wang\u2019s crime was defending \u2018evil cult\u2019 Falun Gong practitioners and using social media to highlight abuses against his clients. It didn\u2019t seem to matter that these actions aren\u2019t illegal, that Wang has broken no laws.</p> <p>The lack of actual evidence has been highlighted several times since January. Beginning in March, police and state security have tried to pressure Wang\u2019s wife, Li Wenzu, his parents, and even a fellow lawyer to record video accusations against him. They failed.</p> <p>The authorities tried coercing responses through threats and promises of lightening his sentence, while the detention centre denied his lawyers and tearful family any contact on the pretext of having no record of him.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jan/20/swedish-activist-peter-dahlin-paraded-on-china-state-tv-for-scripted-confession\">Swedish activist Peter Dahlin paraded on China state TV for 'scripted confession'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Li Wenzu has not been spared.

Since 2012, Wang has arranged with a trusted colleague to represent him if detained or arrested, a sad necessity in China that most rights lawyers eventually need their own defence lawyers.</p> <p>Wang has told us many times since 2010 that under no circumstances would he ever accept a court appointed lawyer. It seems no sham trial is complete without a sham lawyer.</p> <p>At trial, imaginary \u201chostile foreign forces\u201d will likely be blamed for Wang\u2019s equally imaginary crimes, as we have seen with recent show trials and a slew of anti-Western propaganda videos.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>At trial, imaginary \u2018hostile foreign forces\u2019 will likely be blamed for Wang\u2019s equally imaginary crimes</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Wang\u2019s work with China Action has been used against him, despite our not having worked together since 2014. It seems irrelevant that our work focused on strengthening Chinese law, because the \u201ccrimes\u201d for which he stands accused are meaningless unless the implementation of Chinese law itself is seen as subverting state power.</p> <p>If the government is serious about there being room for the rule of law in China, it must immediately release Wang Quanzhang and dismiss all charges against him. We hope it is. For rights defenders like Wang and his colleagues \u2013 who any nation should be proud to have as citizens \u2013 a conviction will reaffirm that it is not.</p> <p><em>Michael Caster and Peter Dahlin are co-founders of the Chinese Urgent Action Working Group (China Action), which existed in China from 2009 until the beginning of 2016, when it was targeted by the Chinese government.</em></p>"
